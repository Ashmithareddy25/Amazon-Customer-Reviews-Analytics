B008CX2A2I|2.0|It works fine with ipad, samsung phone but with my samsung galaxy tab 2 it connects but it doesn't play any music.  I think the software need to be updated. I had look in some internet forums and I am not the only one with this problem.
0307476073|5.0|Fantastic book. One of the better ones I have read. She not only has the courage to look inside of herself and see her weakness and strength, she has the courage to write about it in a very frank and open way. I have gained a lot of respect for her. Was a hard book to put down. Highly recommend.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a fun challenge.  After I saw someone playing this game, I thought I. would give it a try.  I had underestimated how much fun it would be.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|if your willing to wait then this game is for you it has all the iconic dinosaurs from  the movies
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|The game itself is very well done. It is fast paced and if you like old school games like Galaga you will like the game play. The problem is with the app - there does not seem to be any pause for the game and there is no exit for the game. The only way I have found to exit the game is to use the home screen \\"button\\" on the Android device. Then the game exits- and sometimes when restarted does not give the option to restart the game where left off. The back Android button does not respond during game play and the usual Android menu button does not respond while the app is running. There needs to be a pause and an option to save game. And there needs to be an easily accessed Exit button. If anyone has found any of this - let me know and I will change this rating - otherwise it gets three stars, because I am tired of starting at Level 1 each time I play the game. With these three missing controls added it would have gotten five stars.<br /><br />Addition to this review - I found a pause button. It is tiny and at the very top right of the display and blends in with the background. There is an exit X that will appear in this same place when you pause and return to the menu. That X will exit the game. BUT - when you come back and play the game it still comes back to Level 1 losing any progress that you have made. I still give this game only three stars until the developer enables the game to resume on restart.

But the future that Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright, a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.<br /><br />The cast led by Christian Bale (as John Connor) & Sam Worthington (in a break-out performance as Marcus Wright) is great!

B00782O7NE|5.0|\\"The Artist\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Hollywood 1927. George Valentin is a silent movie superstar. The advent of the talkies will sound the death knell for his career and see him fall into oblivion. For young extra Peppy Miller, it seems the sky's the limit - major movie stardom awaits.<br /><br />The cast led by Jean Dujardin (terrific in his Oscar-winning performance as George Valentin) & Berenice Bejo (superb in her Oscar-nominated performance as Peppy Miller) is brilliant. The directing & story & screenplay (also Oscar-nominated) by Michel Hazanavicius (who won the Best Director Oscar for his work on the film, he also was nominated for his work in film editing on the film) is brilliant.<br /><br />The (Oscar-winning) music by Ludovic Bource is brilliant.

This is also a well-made and amusingly intriguing film that is really different from what we are used to seeing in movies. This is an interesting tribute to the movie era of the last 1920's and early 1930's. This is one of the best films of last year and definitely deserving of its Oscar for Best Picture.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|When Netflix originally recommended this to me I was skeptical.  I am not into slasher movies and I am not a fan of B movies, but let me tell you that I was so pleasantly surprised by this well done comedy.  The first time I watched it, I had to pause it a couple of times because I was laughing so hard.  Tucker and Dale are a couple of good hearted hillbillies, off to the mountains to spend the week end in their new vacation cabin when they encounter a group of college kids headed in to the hills for a weekend of drinking and camping.  Misunderstandings happen and the carnage ensues.<br />This movie has some strong language and many scenes or gore, but it is a hilarious time.

B00275EGX8|5.0|\\"The Hurt Locker\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In the summer of 2004, Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge of Bravo Company are at the volatile center of the war, part of a small counterforce specifically trained to handle the homemade bombs, or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), that account for more than half of American hostile deaths and have killed thousands of Iraqis. A high-pressure, high-stakes assignment, the job leaves no room for mistakes, as they learn when they lose their team leader on a mission. When Staff Sergeant William James takes over the team, Sanborn and Eldridge are shocked by what seems like his reckless disregard for military protocol and basic safety measures. And yet, in the fog of war, appearances are never reliable for long. Is James really a swaggering cowboy who lives for peak experiences and the moments when the margin of error is zero - or is he a consummate professional who has honed his esoteric craft to high-wire precision? As the fiery chaos of Baghdad swirls around them, the men struggle to understand and contain their new leader long enough for them to make it home. They have only 38 days left in their tour of Iraq, but with each new mission comes another deadly encounter, and as James blurs the line between bravery and bravado, it seems only a matter of time before disaster will strike.<br /><br />The cast led by Jeremy Renner (in an Oscar-caliber performance as James) & Anthony Mackie (equally impressive as Sanborn) is excellent! The directing by Kathryn Bigelow (also produced) (who also wrote and directed \\"Near Dark\\" (1987), directed \\"Point Break\\" (1991) & \\"Strange Days\\" (1995) is brilliant!

Little (who also did the costume design to the upcoming \\"The Crazies\\" (2010) is excellent!<br /><br />This is an impressive action-thriller / war film that is better than most done recently. This is one of the best films of the year, if not, the best film of the year. This will possibly be remembered during Oscar season.

B0019EXZYE|5.0|\\"The Bank Job\\" is great! This is how the story goes: A car dealer with a dodgy past and new family, Terry has always avoided major-league scams. But when Martine, a beautiful model from his old neighborhood, offers him a lead on a foolproof bank hit on London's Baker Street, Terry recognizes the opportunity of a lifetime. Martine targets a roomful of safe deposit boxes worth millions in cash and jewelry. But Terry and his crew don't realize the boxes also contain a treasure trove of dirty secrets - secrets that will thrust them into a deadly web of corruption and illicit scandal that spans London's criminal underworld, the highest echelons of the British government, and the Royal Family itself...the true story of a heist gone wrong...in all the right ways. The cast led by Jason Statham (as Terry Leather) is great!

This is an great heist thriller that keeps you thinking and interested. This is also one of the better movies of this year, so far.

B0012GVKVY|5.0|\\"I, Robot\\" is excellent! Will Smith (who also executive produced) is perfect as Del Spooner. Bridget Moynahan as Susan Calvin, Alan Tudyk as Sonny, James Cromwell as Dr. Alfred Lanning, Bruce Greenwood as Lawrence Robertson, Chi McBride as Lt. John Bergin round out the cast in this mind-blowing special-effects extravaganza. Alex Proyas, who directed \\"The Crow\\" (1994) & \\"Dark City\\" (1998) is excellent and has directed another sci-fi masterpiece to add to his resume. The story by Jeff Vintar and screenplay by Vintar and Akiva Goldsman is excellent. The music by Marco Beltrami is well crafted and excellent. The cinematography by Simon Duggan is excellent. The film editing by Shawn Broes, William Hoy, Richard Learoyd, Armen Minasian is excellent. The casting by Juel Bestrop, Coreen Mayrs, Jeanne McCarthy is excellent. The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos, who also designed Proyas' \\"Dark City\\" (1998) & Smith's \\"Independence Day\\" (1996) has made an excellent look into what the future will look like in the next 50 years. The costume design by Liz Keogh, Elizabeth Palmer, Lizzie Palmer is excellent. The visual effects and animation by Digital Domain is excellent and looks to be an possible Oscar nominee for Best Visual Effects for next year's Oscars. The design of Chicago in the future is excellent. The CGI robots are brilliant. This is action, sci-fi, mind-blowing visual effects, that sometimes make a movie what it is, \\"I, Robot\\" (2004) for example.

B002BVYBC4|5.0|This sequel to \\"The Fast And The Furious\\" is better even without Vin Diesel in it. Paul Walker is back and better as ex-cop Brian O' Conner, who is now in a street racing gang. He is then arrested and is told about a druglord named Carter Verone, played with excellence by Cole Hauser. He takes the job, but, with help of his own, a old childhood friend Roman Pearce, played with nice commitment by Tyrese Gibson. I don't want to tell anymore because that will be giving away too much information. John Singleton, the director, is brilliant at directing this movie and this will surely be one of my favorites of his for all time. David Arnold's score is brilliant as much as the movie is.

And from convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the wheel.<br /><br />The cast led by Vin Diesel (as Dominic), Paul Walker (as Brian), Michelle Rodriguez (as Letty) & Jordana Brewster (as Mia Toretto) is great!

This is the sequel that should have happened 6 years earlier, but, still great, nonetheless. Vin Diesel is back and is better than ever in his comeback vehicle.
B00ABMZRVO|5.0|It is rare to find a romantic drama that is intimate, honest, and realistic and so much more so to find a gay film of this sort.  However, this is accomplished in this piece.  The cinematography, acting, and story itself are high quality and reflective of gay culture and true to gay struggles.  I definitely recommend it!
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|\\"Moneyball\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Billy Beane was once a would-be baseball superstar who, stung by the failure to live up to expectations on the field, turned his fiercely competitive nature to management. Heading into the 2002 season, Billy faces a dismal situation: his small-market Oakland A's have lost their star players (again) to big market clubs (and their enormous salaries) and is left to rebuild his team and compete with a third of their payroll. Driven to win, Billy takes on the system by challenging the fundamental tenants of the game. He looks outside of baseball, to the dismissed theories of Bill James, and hires Peter Brand, a brainy, number-crunching, Yale-educated economist. Together they take on conventional wisdom with a willingness to reexamine everything and armed with computer driven statistical analysis long ignored by the baseball establishment. They reach imagination-defying conclusions and go after players overlooked and dismissed by the rest of baseball for being too odd, too old, too injured or too much trouble, but who all have key skills that are universally undervalued. As Billy and Peter forge forward, their new methods and roster of misfits rile the old guard, the media, the fans, and their own field manager, who refuses to cooperate. Ultimately this experiment will lead not only to a change in the way the game is played, but to an outcome that would leave Billy with a new understanding that transcends the game and delivers him to a new place.<br /><br />The cast led by Brad Pitt (terrific as Billy Beane, who also produced the film) & Jonah Hill (excellent as Peter Brand) is brilliant. The directing by Bennett Miller is brilliant. The story by Stan Chervin & the screenplay by Steven Zaillian & Aaron Sorkin is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Mychael Danna is brilliant. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is brilliant. The film editing by Christopher Tellefsen is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler is brilliant. The production design by Jess Gonchor is brilliant. The art direction by Brad Ricker & David Scott is brilliant. The set decoration by Nancy Haigh is brilliant. The costume design by Kasia Walicka-Maimone is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliant film that keeps you entertained and your mind thinking. This is also well-made and well-crafted, as well. Brad Pitt gives one of the best performances, if not, the best performance, of his career. This is one of the best movies of the year and of the fall season. This is also one of the best baseball movies of all-time.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very fun, but also very addictive.  Some of the levels are quite challenging and you may nerd rage a time or two.
B003M8NGM6|5.0|This movie opens brilliantly with Trinity driving off a rooftop on a motorcycle, then jumping off and crashing the motorcycle into a small security station blowing it up and ends with To Be Concluded. This is the best sequel that I have ever seen since \\"The Godfather Part II\\". The stunts and visuals are far better than the first one and this one is now an instant cult classic just like the first Matrix. Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, but in a far more better performance than the first one. Laurence Fishburne is excellent as Morpheus, in a much well made peformance that was as good as the first one but just a little bit better. Carrie-Anne Moss is great as Trinity, with a little more style to her performance than the first one. Hugo Weaving is brilliant as Agent Smith, the ruthless agent bend on stopping Neo's crusades. I think that this one is better because of how better the fight scenes are and how more advanced the visuals are than before. I recommend this movie because of how it pulls into its path of box-office and critical destruction.

This nearly made my top 10 best movies of the year, but, there are so many choices in movies this last year, I couldn't make my mind up where to put it. But, still, it is an excellent little indie gem that rarely comes along. Page and the cast are amazing and some of them, like her, give Oscar-worthy performances. This is a fine film.

B009MO5960|5.0|\\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: The Umbrella Corporation's deadly T-virus continues to ravage the Earth, transforming the global population into legions of the flesh eating Undead.

B00AEBBAEU|5.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: An epic tale of family, faith, power and oil set on the incendiary frontier of California's turn-of-the-century petroleum boom. The story chronicles the life and times of one Daniel Plainview, who transforms himself from a down-and-out silver miner raising a son on his own into a self-made oil tycoon. When Plainview gets a mysterious tip-off that there's a little town out West where an ocean of oil is oozing out of the ground, he heads with his son, H.W., to take their chances in dust-worn Little Boston. In this hardscrabble town, where the main excitement centers around the holy roller church of charismatic preacher Eli Sunday, Plainview and H.W. make their lucky strike. But even as the well raises all of their fortunes, nothing will remain the same as conflicts escalate and every human value--love, hope, community, belief, ambition and even the bond between father and son--is imperiled by corruption, deception and the flow of oil. The cast led by Daniel Day-Lewis (in a brilliant Oscar-nominated, career-best performance as Daniel Plainview) is excellent!

The art direction by Anthony A. Ianni is excellent! The costume design by Alex Kavanagh (who also did the costume design to \\"Saw II\\") is excellent! This is an impressive third sequel to a movie trilogy. This is just as inventive or even more inventive than the original \\"Saw\\" (2004) was, or is and it is surpasses its sequel and even its original by making the movie a little more character driven! This movie will keep you guessing until the very end, or even at the beginning of the movie you will be guessing for a very long time for what is to come! Still, the first two \\"Saw\\" movies are impressive, however this is the best of the series. This just kicks the movies up a notch.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|\\"District 9\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Thirty years ago, aliens made first contact with Earth. Humans waited for the hostile attack, or the giant advances in technology. Neither came. Instead, the aliens were refugees, the last survivors of their home world. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa's District 9 as the world's nations argued over what to do with them.<br /><br />Now, patience over the alien situation has run out. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company uninterested in the aliens' welfare -- they will receive tremendous profits if they can make the aliens' awesome weaponry work. So far, they have failed; activation of the weaponry requires alien DNA.<br /><br />The tension between the aliens and the humans comes to a head when an MNU field operative, Wikus van der Merwe, contracts a mysterious virus that begins changing his DNA. Wikus quickly becomes the most hunted man in the world, as well as the most valuable -- he is the key to unlocking the secrets of alien technology. Ostracized and friendless, there is only one place left for him to hide: District 9.<br /><br />The cast led by Sharlto Copley (in an impressive performance as Wikus) is great!

B007KQ6XYY|3.0|Cut the Rope is one of the most popular series of app games in the app store. But just like Angry Birds, they can just make more levels, add an extra gimmick or feature or two, re-skin it, an call it a new game. This is the case for Cut The Rope: Experiments. I played the original Cut The Rope, and I can assure you that it's much better than throwing birds at pigs. The game looks neat on my Kindle Fire HD, and there is no problem with the visuals of this game. The core mechanic is still intact: solve puzzles to get the candy to the green monster (His name is Om-nom? I'm not calling him that) and optionally, but neccessary to open the next level packs, get the 3 stars in the level. The extra stuff like spiders, bubbles, etc. are still there. There are one or two extra things that will be part of the puzzles you're given, but there's not much new. If you're really stuck on a level, some annoying person that sounds like an old scientist will say random phrases if you keep restarting the level, like :\\"I know you can do it!\\". He also says other annoying phrases when you win a level: \\"A Nobel prize that is!\\" and other crappy lines. For some reason, his voice really irritates me. The levels are still a piece of cake to beat, but they offer you to use real money to buy some superpowers to Om-Nom so he can help you beat the level, not that you really needed help with these relatively easy puzzles. I give this game a 2.7/5

B001TOD9VI|5.0|\\"The Wrestler\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a 1980s-era pro wrestler, has become a burnt-out shell of his former self. After he has a heart attack during a small-time match, a doctor tells him he could die if he fights again. In an effort to build a new life, Robinson takes a job at a deli, falls in love with an aging stripper and tries to rebuild a relationship with his daughter. But the prospect of a rematch with his old nemesis, the Ayatollah, proves too tempting to resist, even if it means risking his life.<br /><br />The cast led by Mickey Rourke (in a outstanding and towering, Oscar-nominated performance as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson), Marisa Tomei (excellent as well in an Oscar-nominated performance as Cassidy), and Evan Rachel Wood (impressive as Stephanie) is excellent!

This is how the story goes: Following a violent thunderstorm, artist David Drayton and a small town community come under vicious attack from creatures prowling in a thick and unnatural mist. Local rumors point to an experiment called the 'The Arrowhead Project' conducted at a nearby top-secret military base, but questions as to the origins of the deadly vapor are secondary to the group's overall chances for survival. Retreating to a local supermarket, Drayton and the survivors must face-off against each other before taking a united stand against an enemy they cannot even see.

B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I am fan of both Tolkien and action movies so basically this movie should have been right up my alley. It was good enough to be seen twice at cinema of which second viewing at IMAX where all the visual glory of the film worked well. But on the DVD this visual magic is almost gone and all the negative issues are starting to raise their ugly heads - and this I mean pretty much literally as when White Orc, Radagast, stone giants and gobling king were just minor annoyances in cinema they felt totally ridiculous when watching on DVD. Radagast at least somehow carried the storyline but others just dragged the story on and on and on and on and there was just too much CGI and too little heart in big part of the movie.<br /><br />There are excellent parts in the movie too: it is mostly good until dwarves leave Rivendell. New Zealand scenery is fantastic, music is beautiful and especially dwarven theme is really haunting - it is also nice that music utilizes already familiar themes from LOTR so that especially elves and Gollum can be also &#34;heard&#34;. Acting is mostly ok too: Martin Freeman IS Bilbo and there are some gems amongst dwarves that hopefully will get more screen time in following movies as now personality of different dwarves was unfortunately sacrificed to excess of action scenes. Even now Balin and Bofur were loveable and of course &#34;hottie&#34; dwarves got plenty of screen time...  I was slightly disappointed how Saruman's character was portayed but just seeing Sir Christopher Lee is always a delight - Cate Blanchett's Galadried was also weirdly spooky but it still did not bother me too much... unlike White Orc and gobling king which were just ridiculous... at least goblin king we will not see again but I guess I still need to tolerate White Orc as despite my annoyance I do still intend to see following movies and hope there is more time for different dwarves to &#34;grow&#34; and hopefully there will be some more singing by the dwarves too.
B00CFA227C|4.0|\\"Jack The Giant Slayer\\" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: An ancient war is reignited when a young farmhand unwittingly opens a gateway between our world and a fearsome race of giants. Unleashed on the Earth for the first time in centuries, the giants strive to reclaim the land they once lost, forcing the young man, Jack, into the battle of his life to stop them. Fighting for a kingdom, its people, and the love of a brave princess, he comes face to face with the unstoppable warriors he thought only existed in legend - and gets the chance to become a legend himself.<br /><br />The cast led by Nicholas Hoult (as Jack), Eleanor Tomlinson (as Isabelle), Ewan McGregor (as Elmont) & Stanley Tucci (as Roderick) is pretty good. The directing by Bryan Singer (who also produced) is pretty good. The story by David Dobkin (who also produced) & Darren Lemke & the screenplay by Lemke, Christopher McQuarrie & Dan Studney is pretty good.<br /><br />The music by John Ottman (who also associate produced & film edited) is pretty good. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel is pretty good. The film editing by Ottman & Bob Ducsay is pretty good. The casting by Roger Mussenden & Jeremy Rich is pretty good. The production design by Gavin Bocquet is pretty good. The art direction by Mark Harris, Phil Harvey, Rod McLean, Peter Russell & Gary Tomkins is pretty good. The set decoration by Richard Roberts, set dressings by Vanessa Cole & Dicken Warner is pretty good. The costume design by Joanna Johnston is pretty good. The character design by Tom Woodruff, Jr. is pretty good. The special effects supervised by Dominic Tuohy is pretty good. The visual effects coordinated by Jennifer-Jo Barker, Ashley Bettini, Blair Brownlee, Jack George, Charlyn Go, Monika Gosch, Sofus Graae, James Greig, Peter Hartless, Kit Ho, Woojo Jeon, Suraj Kaur Khalsa, Nancy Lamontagne, Susan Luciani, David Masure-Bosco, Chris McLeod, Elizabeth Montes, Brendan O'Connor, Alexis Torres, Samantha Townend, ChrisW. Tucker, K. Marie Walters, Toby White & Fahed Alhabib, supervised by Greg Butler, Allan Magled, Sebastien Moreau, Stephen Rosenbaum, Keith Sellers, Joe Takai & Hoyt Yeatman is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Steve Dent & Rowley Irlam is pretty good.<br /><br />This is a solid and decently crafted fantasy adventure that is fun and entertaining. This is also a decently-made movie, visually and artistically. Nicholas Hoult makes from an interesting hero as Jack and Ewan McGregor is also interesting, as well, as his eventual mentor Elmont. Eleanor Tomlinson is also interesting as Princess Isabelle. Bryan Singer has made a different movie than what he is usually known for making.

There is a new criminal mastermind at large - Professor Moriarty - and not only is he Holmes' intellectual equal, but his capacity for evil, coupled with a complete lack of conscience, may actually give him an advantage over the renowned detective. Holmes' investigation into Moriarty's plot becomes ever more dangerous as it leads him and Watson out of London and across Europe, to France, Germany and finally to Switzerland. But the cunning Moriarty is always one step ahead as he spins a web of death and destruction - all part of a greater plan that, if he succeeds, will change the course of history.<br /><br />The cast led by Robert Downey, Jr. (as Sherlock Holmes) & Jude Law (as Watson) is great.

B000FBJAEG|3.0|After finishing \\"The Hit\\", I was looking around in Baldacci's past works for something that might be similar in the format of a mystery series. This book is pretty good in that respect. But it is not a perfect book, especially if you are a little older, as I am. At 70, I almost need to take notes on the characters as they are introduced to keep everything straight. However the benefit of that is that I can probably enjoy reading it again in about six months while you kids with sharp memories might be bored the second time through.<br /><br />There are many characters in this book. The two primary are, of course, King and Maxwell. They are each Secret Service Agents, or former agents who made the mistake of letting the people die (or disappear) whom they were charged to protect. Maxwell's problem was recent and Sean's was 8 years earlier. A third character who enters as an unexpected visitor at Sean's house in the Virginia mountains is Joan Dillinger. In the beginning Baldacci says Sean has an ex-wife. When Joan shows up, he treats her very much like one would treat an ex-wife and she reciprocates with a measured friendliness, acting like she owns him. This turns out not to be the case. But she is a former Secret Service Agent who played a key part in Sean's mistake where he failed to prevent the man he was guarding from getting shot. They may not have been married but they had acted like it. She presents herself nude on the dining table.<br /><br />Sean has managed to make a new life for himself in the Virginia hills doing basic lawyering. He thinks his past problems are behind him. But they catch up with him when a man working in his office is murdered and turns out to be a Protected Witness. Michell Masxwell comes to see Sean looking for advice on how to recover from being dumped by the Secret Service. Joan Dillenger comes to see Sean to help him with the murder in his office because she has quit the Secret Service and become a Private Investigator. She can make a lot of money if she finds who killed the guy in Sean's office. She asks him to join her for a split of some of that money. Then a lot of other people get into the act from the FBI, the Secret Service and the US Marshall's Office. A team is organized to figure out who did what to whom. A primary bad guy is on the team. Some old ladies that King and Maxwell interview, or King and Dillinger interview, end up mysteriously dying in bathtubs in different places around Virginia. It begins to look like present-day problems related to Maxwell's protection problem are related to Sean's protection problem from 8 years earlier. During all this King and Maxwell become romantically attracted while King remain's unattracted to Dillinger (despite her efforts).  Maxwell uncovers the fact that Dillinger mistakenly caused King to be significantly distracted just as the assassin fired at the man he was to protect.<br /><br />The web of the investigation spreads wide and involves many diverse people. When it came time to finish the story, Baldacci had a tough time. It does not go smoothly. An innocent young lady gets killed for no reason except by accident. King gives up a lot of money after losing his big fancy home in an explosion. Some of the characters may be happy but some are probably just confused. It seemed as though someone told Baldacci to finish the story; so he finished it before he was ready. But it does set the stage for what could be some nice following books in the series.<br /><br />I hope the next book in the series is better. I am starting it now.lot of money if she finds who killed the guy in Sean's office. She asks him to join her for a split of some of that money.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Jack Reacher is a tough guy with heart, integrity, and more than a few quirks. A Wanted Man was an enjoyably easy read, engrossing and hard to put down. I loved the pace of the story and the feeling that Mr. Child has graciously made us a party to the insider banter of some of the most dangerous occupations in the world. I would have given it five stars, but for the slightly irritating habit of repeating a quirky \\"Jackism\\" twice within a single chapter, (this technique was used several times throughout the story), was it for emphasis or just because we may not have caught the cleverness of Jack the first time around? Aside from that slight annoyance, a greatly entertaining read that I heartily recommend.

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Great movie!  From the minute the movie started to the very end.  I felt like I was in that water with Naomi Campbell fighting for my life and the life of my child.  And I cried like a baby at the end.  Would definitely recommend this to men and woman alike.

B001KW0C96|5.0|\\"Righteous Kill\\" is great! This is how the story goes: A pair of veteran New York City police detectives are on the trail of a vigilante serial killer. After 30 years as partners in the pressure cooker environment of the NYPD, highly decorated Detectives David 'Rooster' Fisk and Thomas 'Turk' Cowan should be ready for retirement, but aren't. Before they can hang up their badges, they are called in to investigate the murder of a notorious pimp, which appears to have ties to a case they solved years before. Like the original murder, the victim is a suspected criminal whose body is found accompanied by a four line poem justifying the killing. When additional crimes take place, it becomes clear the detectives are looking for a serial killer, one who targets criminals that have fallen through the cracks of the judicial system. His mission is to do what the cops can't do on their own--take the culprits off the streets for good. The similarities between the recent killings and their earlier case raise a nagging question: Did they put the wrong man behind bars?<br /><br />The cast led by Robert De Niro (as Turk) & Al Pacino (as Rooster) is excellent! The directing by Jon Avnet (who has produced movies, such as, \\"Risky Business\\" (1983), and directed and also produced movies, such as, \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" (1991), and most recently, did \\"88 Minutes\\" (2008, which also starred Pacino) is excellent!

This is an excellent reunion for De Niro and Pacino, 13 years since \\"Heat\\" (1995). Their roles in this movie couldn't be any different than they were in \\"Heat\\".
B009NY43NY|1.0|This is not an overly harsh review and I am not just mad that Sookie and Eric didn't end up together, this was genuinely a bad book. The plot was utterly ridiculous, there are numerous inconsistencies and no real conclusion to the Eric/Freyda/FdC/Sookie issue. It is a real shame that this fictional world ended this way because I do give CH credit for imagining some really interesting characters and worlds unfortunately the world is not concluded as neatly as it began. Very disappointing. I am normally not a person who reads fanfiction but I just may in this case since the author did such a poor job.
B001PR0YGC|5.0|\\"The Informant\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: What was Mark Whitacre thinking? A rising star at agri-industry giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Whitacre suddenly turns whistleblower. Even as he exposes his company's multi-national price-fixing conspiracy to the FBI, Whitacre envisions himself being hailed as a hero of the common man and handed a promotion. But before all that can happen, the FBI needs evidence, so Whitacre eagerly agrees to wear a wire and carry a hidden tape recorder in his briefcase, imagining himself as a kind of de facto secret agent. Unfortunately for the FBI, their lead witness hasn't been quite so forthcoming about helping himself to the corporate coffers. Whitacre's ever-changing account frustrates the agents and threatens the case against ADM as it becomes almost impossible to decipher what is real and what is the product of Whitacre's rambling imagination. Based on the true story of the highest-ranking corporate whistleblower in U.S. history.<br /><br />The cast led by Matt Damon (as Whitacre) is excellent! The directing and cinematography (under the name Peter Andrews) by Steven Soderbergh (who also directed and did the cinematography to \\"Ocean's 11, 12, & 13\\" (2001, 2004, & 2007) (all three also starred Damon and George Clooney, the first two also starred Julia Roberts), \\"Traffic\\" (2000), \\"Out Of Sight\\" (1998, also starring Clooney), \\"Solaris\\" (2002, also starred Clooney, and also wrote the screenplay and did the film editing under the name Mary Ann Bernard) & \\"Erin Brockovich\\" (2000, also starring Roberts) is excellent!

B008JFUP0I|5.0|\\"Fast & Furious 6\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Since Dom and Brian's Rio heist toppled a kingpin's empire and left their crew with $100 million, our heroes have scattered across the globe. But their inability to return home and living forever on the lam have left their lives incomplete. Meanwhile, Hobbs has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled mercenary drivers across 12 countries, whose mastermind is aided by a ruthless second-in-command revealed to be the love Dom thought was dead, Letty. The only way to stop the criminal outfit is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks Dom to assemble his elite team in London. Payment? Full pardons for all of them so they can return home and make their families whole again.<br /><br />The cast led by Vin Diesel (who also produced) (as Dominic Toretto), Paul Walker (as Brian O'Conner) & Dwayne Johnson (as Luke Hobbs) is great. The directing by Justin Lin is great. The screenplay by Chris Morgan is great.<br /><br />The music by Lucas Vidal is great. The cinematography by Stephen F. Windon is great. The film editing by Greg D'Auria, Kelly Matsumoto & Christian Wagner is great. The casting by Lucinda Syson is great. The production design by Jan Roelfs is great. The art direction by Guy Bradley, Toby Britton, Gavin Fitch, James Hambidge, Erik Polczwartek, Stuart Rose & Leslie Tomkins is great. The set decoration by Richard Roberts, set dressings by Paul Hearn, set designs by Charlotte Malynn is great. The costume design by Sanja Milkovic Hays is great. The special effects coordinated by Teresa Costa & Victoria Stokes, supervised by Pau Costa & Joss Williams is great. The visual effects coordinated by Katrina Barton, Sophie Cullen, James Greig, Anita Ho, Claudia Li, Sarah McLauchlan, Dennis Murillo, Allison Paul, Yinai Sun, Bill Wang & Sarah Yunrong Yu, supervised by Eric D. Christensen, Scott M. Davids, Sean Andrew Faden, Chris Harvey, Nathan McGuinness, Kelvin McIlwain, Boris Schmidt, David Vickery &Edson Williams is great. The stunts coordinated by Greg Powell & Spiro Razatos, fights coordinated by Olivier Schneider is great.<br /><br />This is a great sequel that is well-done and well-made, also entertaining, too. This is also another great sequel to the \\"Fast & Furious\\" franchise and another sequel that keeps upping the game, in terms of plotline. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker & Dwayne Johnson return, yet again, for another ride in the fast lane. This is also one of the best sequels of the year and of the summer season, thus far. It is also one of the best movies of the summer season, thus far, as well.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I think it's a good game but u guys need to put more fighting on the ground but still okay game
B000ZELISO|5.0|\\"Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealousy but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.<br /><br />The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry), Rupert Grint (as Ron) & Emma Watson (as Hermione) is excellent! The directing by David Yates (who also directed \\"Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix\\" (2007), he is also directed the upcoming \\"Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II\\" (2010 & 2011) is excellent! The screenplay (based On J.K. Rowling's novel) by Steve Kloves (who also did the screenplays to \\"Wonder Boys\\" (2000) & almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of \\"The Order Of The Phoenix\\") is excellent!<br /><br />The music by Nicholas Hooper (who also did the music to \\"Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix\\") is excellent!

The film editing by Mark Day (who also did the film editing to \\"Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix\\" & \\"Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II\\") is excellent! The casting by Fiona Weir (who also did the casting to \\"Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire\\" (2005), \\"Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix\\" & \\"Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II\\") is excellent! The production design by Stuart Craig (who also did the production design to all of the Harry Potter movies) is excellent! The art direction by Andrew Ackland-Snow (senior art director) (who also did the art direction to almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of the upcoming \\"The Deathly Hallows Part II\\"), Alastair Bullock (who has worked on almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" (2001), Molly Hughes (who has worked on almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" & \\"The Chamber Of Secrets\\" (2002), Tino Schaedler (who also did the art direction to the upcoming \\"Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time\\" (2010) and also worked on \\"Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix\\"), Hattie Storey (who has worked on \\"Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire\\", \\"Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix\\" & the upcoming \\"Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part I\\"), Gary Tomkins (who has worked on all of the Harry Potter movies) & Sloane U'Ren is excellent! The set decoration by Stephanie McMillan (who also did the set decoration to all of the Harry Potter movies) is excellent! The costume design by Jany Temime (who also did the costume design to almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of \\"The Chamber Of Secrets\\" & \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\") is excellent!<br /><br />This is an excellent sequel to the Harry Potter movies. This is an excellent film that is one of the best movies of the year. It is also one of the best movies of the summer.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Lots of great information and inspiration. I look forward to reading more of his work.
B001FB563E|5.0|\\"The Road\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: An epic post-apocalyptic tale of the survival of a father and his young son as they journey across a barren America that was destroyed by a mysterious cataclysm. It imagines a future in which men are pushed to the worst and the best that they are capable of -- a future in which a father and his son are sustained by love.<br /><br />The cast led by Viggo Mortensen (in an impressive performance as Man) is excellent! The directing by John Hillcoat (who also directed \\"The Proposition\\" (2005) is excellent! The screenplay (based on Cormac McCarthy's novel) by Joe Penhall is excellent!<br /><br />The music by Nick Cave (who also wrote the screenplay to \\"The Proposition\\") & Warren Ellis (who also did the music to \\"The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford\\" (2007) & \\"The Proposition\\") is excellent! The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe (who also did the cinematography to \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" (2008), \\"The Twilight Saga: New Moon\\" (2009) & the upcoming \\"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse\\" (2010) is excellent!

The costume design by Margot Wilson (who also did the costume design to \\"The Proposition\\") is excellent!<br /><br />This is an excellent film that keeps your mind racing. This is an excellent adaptation to Cormac McCarthy's novel. Mortensen gives an Oscar-worthy performance.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I like the love story behind this book. But find it lacking in keeping my interest. Yes I want to know what happens so I keep reading but find my self skipping over parts bc it's not that interesting
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|You get less songs on this CD, but the songs last much, much longer.  He sounds great, but I think it'll take me a little time to get used to his new songs.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Amazing!!  Couldn't put it down once I started.  Can't wait to read the rest of the books although it seems they get worse from here...
B00CATSONE|3.0|I ENJOYED LEARNING HOW TESLA CHANGED THE WORLD AND DIDN'T GIVE UP.  I WAS FASCINATED BY ALL THAT YOU SHARED- I wished that the book was longer.  AFTER READING THE PROLOG I FELT I WAS really being set up for a sales.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Edge of the seat nail biter. One of the better movies of the year. Worth every penny and glad I own it.
B0075FLTV2|5.0|Ever since George Michael was in Wham! I have enjoyed his alluring and smooth voice. I am one of those people who may be biased to the early stuff. But I am pleasantly surprised with this \\"new\\" piece. It has such beautiful and seductive qualities in it...very smooth and relaxed feel. Needless to say I bought this song right after hearing the sample. I'm encouraged to give this album a complete listen to. =)
0307341577|1.0|I felt dirty reading it and I loved her other 2 books. It was sort of greasy repellant. Unpleasant. Didnt finish it.
B007GU5COG|5.0|Back in the day when this song first debuted, I loved the song at first listen but could not find the album. Remember, back then it was either cassettes or vinyl. And I thought the song was a George Michael LP not a Wham! LP.  Fastforward some years and poof! I buy this song from Amazon. Lovely.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|They say it the ship was based off the design of a dagger.<br />Yeah right, put a strap on the back of this thing and you've got yourself one giant nerdy Lego shield.<br />It really is that big.<br /><br />While it would have been fun to have some spinning turrets, that would mean 500+ moving parts.<br />That would have been an absolute nightmare.<br />One thing that caught me off guard were the red engines. I had thought them to be blue but I looked it up and they are red.<br /><br />If you grab this kit, it WILL be the centerpiece of your collection.
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|It was good and fun for some parts, and when I finished/defeated the final boss, the game closed and forgot all my process.
B009ZG6YPU|4.0|The idea of acquiring intelligence through human intervention - radical brain surgery, hormone therapy - is a dream of many. How such &#34;suddenly acquired&#34; intelligence would affect an individual, the &#34;emotional side&#34; of the mind is a primary subject of this wonderful book. Charlie Gordon is a character one will remember forever.
1439156816|5.0|This book is brief, hard hitting and spot on.  As you would imagine King's writing<br />is great, but surprisingly he is HILARIOUS!!  The guidance on writing is priceless!!
B0067R0APK|5.0|I have used AccuWeather products for years.  This is the best yet.  Give it a try.  You will like it.
0205313426|5.0|This is &#34;The Elements of Style&#34;, This book is required reading for any writer<br />or teacher of proper English.<br />Nuff said
B004SN8Z2U|5.0|i  am more than pleased with this shoe. It has a great amount of toe space which I need, although I have not been able to run in it yet as a walk around shoe again its great.
2874270830|5.0|What a great, great book
0062014102|5.0|This is one of these books that you keep in your library forever. I won't discuss what could be true or not because other reviewers have done it already in a much better way that I would be able to. For some people it's very hard to believe that the universe (physical reality) is much more  &#34;plastic' and malleable that we allow ourselves to believe but that's what we have been taught so I don't blame them but it's important to keep an open mind. The holographic idea explains our reality in a much better way than the big bang model which in my opinion will be obsolete in a few years and  even string theory.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|It's a fantastic album with well thought emotion and lyrics. That being said, its not what I expected from Daft Punk.
B002GTZSZU|4.0|I hope that the story line did keep to Wolfee's life.  The filming in Europe was very impressive.<br /><br />I think I did good getting this movie
B008XX6J4C|3.0|Given the 5 star Amazon rating, I was disappointed by this CD. First of all, the sound quality is sub par for a CD, more like what one expects from an MP3. As for the music itself, I expected more interesting creations. Frankly, a good portion of this album doesn't rise much above the level of background music. The Piano Guys certainly get an A for their ability to promote themselves commercially, but there's really not much here that's all that special in a musical sense. This is an eminently forgettable CD, not one that I'll be coming back to time and again to play. My advice: The &#34;Guys&#34; ought to stick to YouTube, and you, the reader, ought to save your money.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is a blast to play on and offline.  It was worth purchasing although I do not like having to purchase more time to play just because it is a FB game.
B001JIDE3M|5.0|I am a big fan of Brendan Fraser.  This is another version of Journey to the Center of Earth but done with more &#34;gusto&#34; and more animation.  Great movie.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Very well-written. Excellent book, stays true to history. The storyline is so fascinating that it's hard to put down, once you open the book!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I can see where young kids might not like this movie but for those of us with children...and a past, this show resonates and entertains. We enjoyed the entire movie. (Be sure to watch the outtakes at the end!)
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|It was very entertaining, definatley worth watching. Wasn't the greatest movie ive ever seen though. I would reccomend it if you are looking for a girls night movie
B0060ANZ2Y|5.0|I'm craving your body, is this real?<br />Temperature's rising I don't want to feel<br />I'm in the wrong place to be real<br /><br />I'm longing to love you just for tonight<br />Kissing and hugging and holding you tight<br />Please let me love you with all my might
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Best worth<br />my money I love all of these books they are so funny and I am just ten years old
B00BUI6D2A|4.0|I don't see why everyone hates this album. It's like all his other albums? I really like it the only songs that suck are back to you, beat that s, hello, days and days, and hello. The rest are amazing!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I totally love this game it takes a lot of patience to win. Relax and enjoy this game.  It's a fun one.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a fun little app with an easy learning curve. It's an app that my kids and I both enjoy playing.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I love using the one click movies and t.v. shows for episodes I haven't seen or for ones I want to see again. Quick set up. A+
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great graphics and long gameplay! Challenging puzzles and hidden object scenes that kept me engrossed for hours! Can't wait for the next one!
B003TH14H4|5.0|I love using the one click movies and t.v. shows for episodes I haven't seen.  Also great for ones I want to see again. Quick set up. A+.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Breathtaking graphics and landscapes. The gameplay is standard for the series.This is my personal favorite of the temple run series.
B00BHWG0EK|5.0|I love Star Trek so there really is nothing left to say; only that I am glad it started out low enough for me to buy it because for what it always sells for is really RIDICULOUS!!!!
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Customer service is great.  I upgraded to avia pro on my kindle fire so I can see my photos and videos on dropbox.  The app wasn't working so I contacted the developer, right away.  They worked on the problem right way and upgraded the software and now it works perfectly.  I like this app.  I would recommend it to any one.
B00BHWG0HW|5.0|I love Star Trek so there really is nothing left to say; only that I am glad it started out low enough for me to buy it because for what it always sells for is really RIDICULOUS!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is fun and it's to unlock the stages as well building your jeeps engine, suspension, tires and 4WD. I have a hard time putting my kindle~
B00BHWG0DQ|5.0|I love Star Trek so there really is nothing left to say; only that I am glad it started out low enough for me to buy it because for what it always sells for is really RIDICULOUS!!!!
B00BFV1K0M|4.0|Having read the first book I was eager to continue with the story and events.<br />While I found the concept of the story a little confronting it was still a good read.
B00BHWG48C|5.0|I love Star Trek so there really is nothing left to say; only that I am glad it started out low enough for me to buy it because for what it always sells for is really RIDICULOUS!!!!
B00BFV1JVM|4.0|My daughter was reading this in her book club so I wanted to discuss it with her. It's not a book that I was drawn to. However it gave rise to a number of issues relevant for our western society.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this app is so addictive, there is lots to do on this app. Oh, plus the update should involve us taming the dragons and could ride them. Just a idea anyway it's a good game. It's worth getting. Best app ever!!
B003Q6CUAI|4.0|Good to have this on my kindle so that I can dip into the various sections as I need them
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Unusual, intriguing, great writing.  I was fascinated by all the stories, and how they were presented.  I have recommended this book to all my reader friends.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|I'm pleased that I completed the set of books and am intrigued  as to how the film was done with specila effects etc.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I am a female who has worked full time since the sixties and could identify with many of the challenges had along the way.  I was blessed to have a husband who had been raised by a working Mother whose husband died at an early age and he knew how important it was that I should stay focused on my career along with raising three daughters.  Unfortunately my husband also died at a young age and with all of my experience was able to move up the &#34;jungle Jim and be successful.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I thought this book by Rick Riordan was brilliant! One of the best books I've ever read. I really liked the quest in this one.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|enjoyed the continuation of Harry & Emma's story and found the character, Sebastian Clifton, even more appealing! You cannot leave your readers of The Clifton series with a cliff hanger again!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I am a Percy Jackson NERD now! I loved that book so so SO much I bought the second one right after I finished the first one. IT WAS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank the Gods!
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Has some nice features overall, and a friendly ui. It does what it's supposed to do, and does it well.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The adventure in this book is really fun to read about! The new characters in the book are fun loving and you get to see some old friends too. Then the huge shocker at the end! If you love Percy as much as I do ( but I doubt it) make sure you have enough money to buy the second book.
B000002PH1|5.0|Delightful cd. I would consider you buying it. Brings back the old days to me. Beautiful voice. I loved it!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is like my favorite book in the entire series! I loved all the battles and the romance! I think Rick Riordan ended it perfectly!
B009R8DJ72|5.0|This Jeff kinney number 1 hit I really think that this book is them best ever hope be is planning to write new books really soon but I really do love this book!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very fun. I love mystery detective books so I thought I would try a mystery detective game, and when I played this I thought WOW. It's almost like your the really the detective but you do need to use the hint button, but I was hooked on it and I recommend you try it. Very fun game.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Got phone a few days ago and this was the first app I downloaded.  Love it so far plan on wearing the thing out.
B004SIMNF0|2.0|Unless you're using a lens six inches or shorter you've got a wrestling match on your hands. Your camera (mine did) will flop, slide and chafe your leg. It might be perfect for someone using four or five cameras at a clip but not for me.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I love it it is just like candy crush but with jewels I hope the put candy crush on every devise
B0083P1QUM|3.0|It has been a while since I have read a Scarpetta novel but I did enjoy this one. I did find at times the story skipped around a bit and was confusing. The end came rather abruptly and while interesting I found it unsatisfying.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I enjoy being able to check my email on my kindle fire! I wasn't able to view it on the web. I check my email every morning. The app downloads the email when my kindle is online. The bell that chimes is annoying.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|First... Unsure why so many people are giving this app 1 star. Honestly... rate the application. Not the fact that it's 99 cents or should be included on the Kindle in the first place. The latter is the fault of Amazon for making the camera \\"not so easy\\" to start -- not the developer of this application.<br /><br />Yes. It's 99 cents. Big whoop. Spend the buck. Why?<br /><br />EASY CAMERA ACCESS<br />While I'm perfectly capable of using EI File Explorer (need to download, install, and know how to use) to find the hidden \\"camera app\\" or go to my photos and click on the camera icon, I wanted an easy way to access my camera from my favorites. The \\"hidden\\" app can't be added to the favorites menu; nor can the \\"button\\" on the photo page.<br /><br />This app is great and does what it was designed to do: provide easy access to the Kindle camera.<br /><br />\\"ONE-STOP SHOP\\" FOR ALL CAMERA FEATURES<br />I now have 1-click access to my camera. AND -- bonus -- the video camera (including an experimental low-res one), and my photo albums/images.
0316069434|5.0|I love Harry Bosch even when he aggravates me by being curt and impatient with those who don't quite live up to his work ethic and passion for finding the truth. He is real, intense, flawed and always interesting.<br /><br />Having just left LA before the riots covered in this book, it was really interesting for me to think about what it was like at that time--the LA I left (after only three years) and the one swamped in violence. I was riveted to the news throughout that time. So the &#34;what if,&#34; of this story was intriguing. Bosch's characters--both the main ones and the ones around the edges are thorough. I will add to that that I wish the role of his daughter was more realistic and that sometimes Bosch's love interest is a bit too understanding and patient. Yes, we women are great, but!<br /><br />I randomly read the Bosch novels starting several years ago. I was so intrigued I went back and read them in order. The character development, style development and overall writing just continues to get better and better and better. Since Connelly is already great, where's this going to go?!
0061122416|5.0|This book made you realize how important life is and to take the time to do whatever you want to do in Life, I will read it again because<br />it makes you feel like a person that wants to do whatever they want to get out of Life.
0316044938|5.0|My niece and I read this novel at the same time--shortly after it was published. It still resounds.<br /><br />It is a complex story--a combination of murder mystery, memoir and spiritual journey.<br /><br />None of Ms. Sebold's books are for the faint of heart, this one especially. Be ready for intensity, for tears and for a climax that hits you hard.<br /><br />Excellent first novel.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps. I take screen captures all the time, jot down little notes, record audio ideas for my music, and tag my pics.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|EPL was such a terrific story, written with brutal honesty and openness, that I didn't think Ms. Gilbert could follow up with a memoir quite as intense. She certainly proved me wrong!<br /><br />Long single for some of the same reasons, I got married a year or so after reading this book. In preparation for taking that big step, this book knocked around in my head for quite sometime. It's almost a preparation guide: Are you really ready to make this commitment? Are you making it for the right reasons?<br /><br />Excellent.
B00AW0KHMY|4.0|I am so happy they added some of the funny features that were in the book but at the same time couldve done without some of the add ins.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Graphics are good. The different level s are challenging and fun to play. Would d recommend especially if you have children.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Everything I need from a game of making. Plenty of choice and plenty of challenge. Could use a little better directions
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great reading plans. prompt reply to a question I had from t he support team. Lots of versions to choose from.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|DO NOT let your children play this game unattended! my nephew just purchased $21 in in-game &quot;coins&quot; that came straight out of my amazon account!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Awesome account of what our &#34;specially&#34; trained soldiers do behind the scenes throughout the world too keep us safe. Notes the frustrations these soldiers endure ruled by politics in doing what they do best. Get things done in spite of political indecision and people in charge that put obstacles in their way. Achieved the ultimate goal of riding the world of a very evil man.
B003WC5EQI|5.0|Eddie Redmayne (Played Angel) is one of the best actors from England. He played several wonderful roles such as in Birdsong and this one. The whole team gave great performed. The landscape is beautiful and script is well done. The director is the best!  I wish we can make some TV shows like these in the US.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very interesting and fun puzzle game. Some parts were challenging but still kept me going, as well as a bit of the story kept me intrigued. Would love to see more from these guys.
B008J05EL8|5.0|Have not used it that often, however the applications I have used have come in very handy. Can be used for many events, etc
B00AFEY354|5.0|My daughter asked for it and it was much less expensive than if I purchased it at a local store. She loves the book and movie.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|It is a mind game which keeps you thinking as well as having to move fast when selecting the tiles. I love this game as it a challenge which is what I look for in games.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|You get a real perspective of what Chris sees and feels, how it affected him and his family. It gives you a sense of the action he saw, his feelings about it and how he juggled the teams with family. Great book!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great app for some one who likes puzzles on the go!!  Easy to use and different levels for challenging the player
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|As a longtime fan of the Beard, collecting and taking in all their studio output since 2001, I was immediately drawn in by the nods to all the greats of the prog-rock genre and Neal Morse's writing style was at times thought-provoking, and at others, just fun sing-alongs.<br /><br />I, like most others I'm sure, were shocked and wondering what was going to happen when Morse decided to bolt for a solo stint on the Christian (prog)-rock scene.  For the record, I've followed his solo work since then as well, but knew without him, there would be something missing.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, V 2.0 saw the mighty Beard do a 'Genesis', and while \\"Feel Euphoria\\" through \\"X\\" were definitely worthy additions into the band's canon of works, at least to me this incarnation was missing that little something that brought me to enjoy the output from the Morse-era.  D'Virgilio, while one of my favorites in the drumming world, just didn't quite have a lead voice that hooked me in.  Add to that, the music and overall writing style seemed to go a more 'heavy metal'-like / electronic / experimental turn....darker, more moody.  Some people like a more realistic approach in songwriting, but I'll admit, bands like Yes and Gabriel-period Genesis spoiled me rotten to the fantasy side of the aisle in prog-rock lyricism, so I don't want angst or too much realism when I'm listening.<br /><br />I figured the band was done in after he left and they were basically again without a label to get their music out, along with no lead vocalist or drummer.<br /><br />Enter Ted Leonard and Jimmy Keegan, as vocalist/songwriter and drummer, respectively.  In short, there couldn't have been a better move pulled off than this.  I've been spinning \\"Brief Nocturnes\\" since receiving it a few days ago.  Anxiousness has turned into excitement...the kind I felt when I first got 'The Light' all those years back.  The mighty Beard is back!<br /><br />The pleasant surprise for me was Neal Morse's involvementin the two tracks 'Afterthoughts' and 'Waiting for Me'.  These are utmost 'classic Beard'....the vocal interplay in the former, the melodic and musical hooks in the latter.  Whilst I am also a fan of Morse's solo output, it is nice to see that, since his project with Transatlantic back in '09, he is starting to sort of come back into doing other projects that have secular themes in play.  I feel this is good for any artist/band.  In short, it's nice to see him back in the fold, even if only temporarily, and only on certain songs.<br /><br />There's more to like with this new output.  In general, Leonard's vocal style is much easier with my ears, and the lyrical themes leave more positive and pleasing imagery in my mind.  There's also a softer approach to the music...it's allowed to breathe again like in their earlier Morse-era works with more acoustic passages than in the D'virgilio-era.  I paid particular attention to the keys on here too.....Ryo's all over this thing with swirling Hammond and Mellotron...and they're allowed to be heard, rather than buried in layers of distorted guitar.<br /><br />If you were at first hesitant to get this album like I was, be hesitant no more.  This long-time Beard fan is enjoying it, that's for sure.

B0076HNMU0|5.0|If you like Lost, then check out Twin Peaks.  Each episode is jammed with surprises, shocks and just good plain fun.  I used to watch it 20 years ago and have recently rekindled my love for this series.  I am truly a Peak Freak!
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Dr. Pulaski was the character this series needed. A kind of a female Dr. McCoy. I always thought that Dr. Crusher was WAY too serious. I never warmed up to that character. Pulaski was more like a real doctor to me. So this is why I always have a fondness for season two. And now even more with this brilliant remaster!
B00BCWPN0M|5.0|Just love the show. I wish there was more Kurt and Blaine in this season but it leads up to a very interesting 5 season. i'm so glad that they are back for season 5 and 6. Can't wait:-)

B00005QG9I|3.0|Ordered &#34;Morning View&#34; by Incubus on VINYL for a Christmas gift. The order arrived in a timely fashion, however, it wasn't a vinyl I received but a CD. The jewel case/album art was for Morning View (which is correct), the disc itself was for Make Yourself, Incubus's earlier album. I'm not rating worse than 3 out of 5 because I did not contact the seller in order to correct the mistake. Still, it was not the format as advertised and the compact disc I received was still the wrong album anyway.

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Strange as it seems, the kids enjoy this app and use it routinely.  Not sure why, as it didn't appeal to me, but they routinely fire up the game and play it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The movie is as good as the book.  The opening scene was amazing and just got better thereafter.  I particularly loved seeing Colm Wilkinson play the Bishop after seeing him in the role of Jean Valjean.  Ann Hathaway played a convincing Fontine.  I couldn't believe Sasha Baron Cohen could be serious, but he did justice to the Innkeeper. Music, lyrics and scoring just don't get better!  I loved the movie!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Easy to use, and very clear.  I'm a big Mahjong and solitaire fan.  This one didn't give me a bunch of ads to fight with.  24-7 seems to be the better producer for these games.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|This is a review of the first three works.  I skipped Little Women as I have read it many times and seen at least two movies plus a theatrical presentation.  I read Good Wives, which I did not realize before was a separate book.  I always thought it was a part of Little Women.  Anyway, I enjoyed it very much.  While I remembered the gist of the story, there were so many details that had slipped from my memory.  Somehow I thought that Jo wrote a book called, My Beth, and that was what touched off her writing career and played a part in her romance with Mr Bhaer.  I don't know where I got that from as either the story had changed, or I got the My Beth part from one of the movies I saw.  Anyway, this book, Little Women - Parts One and Two - has been an endearing classic for quite a few generations of women, young and old.  I watched the movies together with some of my older granddaughters, and they too fell in love with Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.<br /><br />I then moved on in my Kindle reading to Little Men.  I found these stories to be as endearing as I remembered them to be from my childhood.  Valuable moral principles are set forth in a natural, nonthreatening sort of way.  I wish our youth of today could be influenced by these wholesome stories as were previous generations.  Perhaps this Kindle edition will prove useful to that end.  However, I think one would have to start when the children were quite a bit younger than previous generations were when introduced to Little Men.  I was sorry to see that this title included a great number of typos which took some thought to determine what word was actually intended.  I will write another review when I proceed further into the collection.  I am giving these three stories five stars, although I probably should delete a star because of the many typos in Little Men.<br /><br />I think Jo's Boys was a new book for me because I can't remember reading these stories before.  Any lover of Little Men should read this sequel which takes place ten years after Little Men.  It follows the boys and girls of Little Men into their adult lives.  Very good advice is given by Aunt Jo as her boys and girls grow up.  It also gives a glimpse of the northeastern part of our country around the turn of the 20th century.<br /><br />The book entitled Moods struck me as a very strange book.  It is very different from the other books I have read by Ms Alcott.  It is more of a psychological study of her characters and certainly has a different ending than I would have expected.  It would be interesting to know at what stage of life she wrote this one.takes place ten years after Little Men.  It follows the boys and girls of Little Men into their adult lives.

B008QMMEOE|3.0|My kids didn't use this too terribly much.  I was looking for something to catch their attention, and this seemed like a good candidate.  Didn't like or hate it.
0553801473|1.0|I had so much hope for this series, but martin did not.<br /><br />Now i am happy to imagine the others blowing the horn, bringing the wall down and invading and killing all of those characters i stopped caring about in the last two books.<br /><br />I hope they all die. I mean they have to eventually, right martin?<br />At least their last meal will be depicted in unbearable detail, i mean that's why i am reading these books!

B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele is a remarkable signer and after watching this Blu-ray I liked her even more. It is an amazing venue that she films at and the Blu-ray allows you to see Adele's personality much more. Also, if like me you were jipped out of Adele visiting your city then here's your opportunity.

0375714839|5.0|When I first picked up Persopolis, I thought it was about the revolution in Iran. I was wrong. It used the revolution as a back drop to a coming of age story. Persoplis is about the lives we lead and the things we do/are forced to do to lead it as peacefully as is possible. It is the story of any young person who is growing up feeling like an alien and trying his/her best to fit into society. It is the story of how in order to be liked by all we lose the person we want to be and those who love us are proud of.<br />Marjane Satrapi has written a story every young man/woman who is still trying to understand and figure his/her place in society should read and pay heed to. It would be a shame if they did not.<br />This graphic novel is now one of my all time favorite books and I will recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading up on an alternative form of literature that has value, is exciting and has the capability of changing someone's life.

B00457WZEI|5.0|Morpurgo's poignant tale of a British farm horse sent off to World War I France proves interesting reading. Narrated straight out of the horse's mouth by Joey, the title animal himself, this story focuses on War as seen from a horse's viewpoint, yet it proves a very human story as well.  Curiously, although the equine protagonist can understand English, French and German with ease, he is incapable<br />of communicating verbally or even mentally with other animals--even horses--when alone. Despite being an animal Joey experiences many human emotions: gratitude, loyalty, jealousy, hope, fear and trust. As a non-speaking character he can only reveal his emotions by his actions and body language.<br /><br />Purchased at an auction more out of spite than out of need or affection by a drunken brute of a farmer, Joey is brought to a small farm. There he soon learns to dislike his owner, but adores his young Master--a 15-year-old youth named Albert, who talks freely to his new friend about matters that he dares not express to his careworn parents.  As Germany invades Belgium threats of war loom, causing general unease. Finally Albert's debt-ridden father sells the horse behind Albert's back to the cavalry, in order to save the farm he claims.  Devastated the boy tires to enlist but is rejected as being<br />underage. His only cherished souvenir of Joey is an oil painting of the horse done by a kindly cavalry officer.<br /><br />Until they are reunited by chance a few years later youth and horse never forget each other, but both  must wait and work stoically. Joey is shipped to France where ex experiences the horrors of war: first in the cavalry, being rammed against barbed wire, then as an ambulance horse slogging through endless mud with heavy loads. While Albert is maturing in England Joey touches the lives of several individuals, especially an old French farmer under German thrall, and his adoring grand-daughter, frail Emilie, who shelter him for many winter months as one of the family.  He even inspires a brief break in hostilities in No Man's Land, as a German and a British soldier debate ownership of the riderless horse.<br /><br />Even after horse and youth are reunited Joey is not entirely safe<br />From the French knackers, for the British Army plans to auction off all horses,<br />instead of transporting them back home--although the entire Veterinary Corps secretly hopes that Albert will be able to claim his long lost Joey and retire him to the clam greensward of England.<br /><br />Even if this book was not inspired by a portrait of the equine hero, this book presents a wonderful story of love and friendship, of sacrifice and faith--all inspired by the effect of this handsome horse upon mankind. Although more like a novella, WAR HORSE stand proudly as a timeless tale of personal courage and devotion; a charming read for kids of all ages.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Fantastic movie!  Just as good as the first one.  Saw it in IMAX 3-D yesterday...loved it.  Glad it's making a lot of money.  Hopefully, the third installment is in the works.  Ignore the naysayers, see it for yourself.  \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" gave it an 'A.\\"  Usually, they don't give those away.  If you are a \\"True\\" fan of the Star Trek franchise, I'm sure you'll love it.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Was an interesting, albeit, disturbing read. I completely believe her version of events based on the sheer fact that her mom would even consider, much less agree to, having her daughter so far away from her for her childhood. It's utterly selfish and speaks volumes to MacLaine self absorption.

B004X6PRO6|2.0|I was intrigued by the title of this book and of course by the fact that it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. My favorite genre is historical fiction, so I thought it would fit the bill. However, I honestly could not get into this story. Cruelty aside, it felt disjointed and somewhat like a patchwork of unconnected events. Was it the culture that did not appeal to me? Not sure. But perhaps most importantly,  I could not develop empathy for the character or his situation. I gave it my best shot and hung in there for a while, but it just wasn't happening for me. Maybe I should try again, given the impact that it has obviously had on others.

B007TNQ7EY|5.0|gangster Rio is a good killing game.  you should be at least 17 to play but I'm 12 . updates come out fast its worth the money
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|So I wish I had not read the book. Although the movie was entertaining enough it was also NOTHING like the book which I really enjoyed. The movie felt like a cleaner-hollywood-watered-down version of the book . . . so disappointing!<br /><br />If you've read the book already: try to have an open mind and TRY to enjoy it.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book: watch the movie and then read the book (I know EVERYONE says this but it really is WAY BETTER than the movie!!!)

B005ERIRZE|4.0|Everyone thinks that their willpower fails them, often on a regular basis. Those people who say they have a lot of willpower often have the least. Willpower is undeniably good to have and in studies it is correlated with all kinds of positive outcomes.<br /><br />Dr.McGonigal thankfully does not teach the reader never to \\"give in\\" to the things you like. Rather you should ask yourself what it is that you would like to stop/start doing and then focus on that goal. She refers to these goals as willpower challenges. Typical willpower challenges are to go to bed in time, to exercise more, to work instead of checking facebook updates, eat less snacks etc etc.<br /><br />Most people have many willpower challenges. One important lesson from this book is that you do not have unlimited willpower. Therefore you should not take on too many willpower challenges simultaneously, because that will result in failure.<br /><br />So what strategies does Dr.McGonigal propose for increasing willpower? This book includes a wealth of advice and I feel pretty confident in claiming that most people will find at least one strategy that helps them. Her first proposed strategy is meditation, which is just not my cup of tea (for me doing meditation would be a willpower challenge on its own). After taking about meditation and breathing exercises she moves on to more obvious candidates: exercise and sufficient sleep. I am sure that you have all heard it before but I will reiterate: exercise is good and getting enough sleep is important for all kinds of things, including willpower. Regarding sleep she also points out that people have started sleeping less in recent decades, and in the same time people have become more obese. In is not inconceivable that the rise in obesity in the recent decades in part is related to reduced willpower which in turn is due to the fact that we sleep less. After all, those evening snacks that we consume in the evening after a stressful day can contain quite a lot of calories.<br />Dr.McGonigal introduces plenty more strategies for overcoming willpower challenges. The ones I feel were most useful include the following: (1) If you really want say a snack, wait 10 minutes, and then, if you still want it, go ahead and take it. (2) Thinking more about your future self. People are often prone to ignoring the needs of their future selves I don't care so much how their actions may affect their future selves. (3) Focusing on what you should do rather than what you shouldn't do. Don't think of pink elephants! Hard right? Similarly constantly telling yourself not to eat that snack will draw your attention to it, making it harder to resist. It is better to focus on what you should and do.<br /><br />There are many willpower traps. Perhaps the most obvious one is exposing yourself to the thing you try to avoid. If you want to eat less snacks, don't keep them in the home cause if you are like me you will eat them, sooner or later. Another trap which I personally used to fall into, is rewarding yourself after a strenuous exercise i.e., now that I have exercised so much I deserve to eat several large burgers and some candy after that =). I am not saying that such a reward in undeserved, only that the calorie intake from a large meal is much larger than the calorie output during exercise. Yet another trap is the \\"what the hell effect\\". Having succumbed to temptation many people say to themselves - what the hell, now that I have started eating this snack I might as well eat the rest...<br /><br />I sum, this book provides an accessible introduction to willpower, what it is, how it works, and what you can do if you face a willpower challenge. Regardless of whether you decide to utilize any of Dr.McGonigal proposed strategies I believe that merely starting to think and learn about willpower will help you reach your personal goals. It is also nice to know that more or less everyone has willpower issues, and very few (sickly?) people never succumb to temptation.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1583334386 The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do To Get More of It]]o temptation.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1583334386 The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do To Get More of It]]

B002SJKWZ4|2.0|Too many steps, that are very sensitive to a specific movement, to program a command into the device.  I bought this more or less as a gag.  It didn't work out.  I don't have days to spend on programming this thing.  And I'm not exactly a neophyte to programming remotes of computers, for that matter.  I can't imagine the effort it would take to try and program this device, for anyone with less tech experience.<br /><br />The gag was on me.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've read the entire trilogy and loved every one.  I thought they did an excellent job making the movie out of the first book but I'm extremely skeptical about the second and third movie being any good.  Sometimes books don't translate well to movies and I think this will be the case with Mockingjay.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading the trilogy if you want a good story that is well written and intriguing.

B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is very fun and addicting. My main issue with it is that so many things cost diamonds which you only get one per level and from defeating a boss. You almost have to spend money on them. To do all the quests, you will have to spend real money which i think is ridiculous. I understand giving the option for spending for extravagant items in game and what not but not just to complete the quest line. Also you need resources to strengthen your military and there is an ask friends for resources button,but it doesn't work, so that irritating. Other than those set backs i really love the game.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is so scary, and fun. I beat it on easy on my first try, but almost died multiple times. Slender has multiple arms coming out of his back, and creeps you out. He pops out, and you have to keep moving. I would have jumped or yelped, but my dad was in the room. Its a really good game and i recommend it to anyone who wants a good scare, or just wants to scare the pants off your friends. I got this app because TOBUSCUS plays slender, and i wanted to see if it really was scary. Trust me, it was!
B00CBRADU2|4.0|Great shoot out scenes and other good action. Love the race car scenes, too. And this review is coming from a girl. So ya, not a bad movie at all.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|I bought this to complete my Firefly collection.  I really liked the series and the movie ending the series was very good.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I was really interested in the studies that showed the differences between introverts and extroverts and how we react to the same situation.  I have been feeling a lot of anger in the workplace lately.  I have always known that the people who get ahead and are respected are not necessarily the hardest workers or the smartest people.  I envy the people who seem to effortlessly spend their days talking and chatting to anybody and everybody.  I'm good in small groups with people I am comfortable with.  I'm good with subjects I care about it.  I am not good with confrontation.  I do not deal well with people who never seem to do the bare minimum at work but laugh and chat their way through the day as though they have no guilt  or even a clue about the fact that others are working circles around them.  But these are the people who get the credit from those who do not work directly with them.<br />While I find the stories of introverts who have found their way in an extrovert world inspiring, it doesn't do much to help me get to that point.  I'd really like some insight into how to deal with conflict in such a way that I am not tormenting myself with the situation for days or even weeks later....
0062059963|4.0|The Elite delivered exactly what I wanted in the second book of the Selection series. There's more drama, more love triangles and more gorgeous gowns fit for a princess-to-be. America Singer is still in the middle working out her feelings regarding her two admirers - Crown Prince Maxon and her childhood sweetheart now Palace guard, Aspen. Every time she thinks she's decided which way her heart is leading her something happens and makes her feel mixed up all over again. Maxon only has six girls left in The Selection and where America was once comfortable regarding his feelings towards the other girls she's now anxious and more jealous than she ever though she'd feel. Emotions are running strong. Marlee is still acting oddly, Celeste has more nasty tricks up her sleeve and the King weighs in with who he think Maxon should pick...<br /><br />The first half of this novel doesn't have much regarding the dystopian aspect of this book but the second half ramps up and delivers some much-anticipated action. The rebels are back and the threat to the crown and country. The remaining girls from the Selection get more time to show who they are as people as well as learning the importance and responsibility of  being Maxon's wife. America is still a little too amazing for my liking - being a hero to the people and the funniest girl in the Selection - but more of her flaws came out as this series is developing. The love triangles are a little overwhelming at times with America deciding on one of her men and then being adamant that it's the other one she's meant to be with. And then another flip-flop in her decision a few pages later.<br /><br />For the Bachelor fans - there's still quite a bit in this book for you! Extravagant balls, a bit of scandal and scheming competitors are still in the mix and feel like they'd be right at home on the show. Whilst the Bachelor aspect is what drew me to this series, I've grown attached to the characters and unique drama Kiera Cass has broughtto her story. I can not wait to read The One and find out who America chooses and which of the remaining contestants will be Maxon's bride - along with just how much more damage the rebels will inflict.

B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I wasn't really sure this would be any good. Just looking at the box I thought it would be a dive. It turned out to be a movie I recommended others to see. I was totally surprised.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|I found this book very crude and repulsive yet could not stop turning the pages. Bukowski really has a talent for story telling and creating a certain intimacy with the reader that is rare to find in modern literature. This story is raw and real and at times made me feel better about my own childhood. Highly recommend to anyone interested in gaining insight into depression-era youth, the mind of an adolescent boy and the makings of an alcoholic.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|A very intense book.  This author was very different from all the other author's I read all the time.  It was okay and I would try another one of her books before I put it aside.
0316023744|5.0|Antony Beevor does a sterling job in covering the history of WW2 in what is indeed a very readable edition.  Readers looking for some personalized stories in the many sagas of this dreadful war are best advised to look elsewhere since besides the virtually approved policy of cannabilism of POWs by starving Japanese (not disclosed at the end of the war so as to not distress Allied families)there are no new revelations to this already extensively covered history.  Still worth a visit to those fascinated by this most dreadful period of mankind's history.

B000FC1HQY|2.0|I tried to read this book several years ago and absolutely hated it, so much so that I didn't finish it.  My book club decided to read it recently and I reluctantly agreed to give it another go.  It wasn't much better the second time around.  The parents were still racist, British snobs who in my opinion had no business being in Africa.  The father could have stayed in England and been a failure there in much better circumstances for his family.  The mother (she had no Christian name that I could determine, rather like the protagonist in Rebecca, though not nearly so sympathetic) was a drunken bigot who hated being in Africa and treated the Africans who &#34;worked&#34;  for the family as not much better than slaves.  Oh, I know, there was all that noblesse oblige business of farm wives with their minimedical clinics dispensed out of the back doors of their farm houses and how the natives were so much better off because of it.  PUHLEASE!  These people should have stayed in the land that they most identified with and given the citizens of the various African countries they inhabited a break.
0525425772|5.0|Good book - waiting for the next one in this series.  This is one of my favorite authors. Kid Lawyer was the best of the series though.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I borrowed this DVD from our local library, and watched it less than half way thru.<br />Am seriously glad that I did not purchase this DVD, and a \\"one star\\" rating is one too many.<br />In my opinion, it has no viable story, is sickening to listen to and watch, and must have been made by some of the same liberal fools that that are attempting to turn the USA into to a cesspool of moral corruption using movies as their tool.<br />I cannot wait to get this filth out of my home.
0765325950|5.0|Epic, full of twists and unexpected turns.  A good end to the story.  I only wish it could go on.  Here is to hoping.
0525425772|5.0|I find John Grisham's, novels to be a treat, like a full sized Snickers bar to be consumed in one sitting! The Theodore Boone series has been one that never panders to young readers but its themes resonate with  young teens. Theodore is something of a nerd with his interest in law  and individual rather than team sports. His parents are both lawyers but with a different array of clients. Mom does family law and divorces, Dad civil and real estate law. This book has Theo at a point where he must measure his heart against the law when his friend's family farm is threatened by eminent domain as the site of a  highway bypass. Theo learns all he can about the pros and cons of the proposal and also finds himself a pivotal figure in the controversy. This is resolved a little more neatly than some of his adult novels but never the less it is an interesting read.

B009UNGYHG|5.0|The charging feature is really nice, and it adds quite a bit of standby time to the charge of the headset. It also eliminates the need for the silly magnetic charging cable, replacing it with the same micro-USB that everything else seems to have these days. That reduces the need for multiple wall warts or car adapters. Good design. My only gripe is that the polystyrene cover seems like it might break with too much use. We shall see.

0399230033|5.0|This is another of my all-time favorite kid's books.  There are no actual story words, so the story is told through the pictures.  Colorful. Clear. And with a lot of detail.  And the &#34;consistency&#34; throughout the book is The Best!!  The children love to follow these details through the book -- the ever-rising red balloon (that gets smaller and higher each time you turn the page), the mouse dragging the banana, the colored keys that unlock the similarly colored locks on each animal's cage, each baby animal has a stuffed animal in his/her cage.  Just delightful and fun!  Highly recommended!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is magnificent. The language was eloquent and meaningful, and the plot flowed. The characters seemed so real and relatable, and I felt like I had really gotten to understand each of their personalities. I would recommend this book to a creative person, who is beyond their years. I enjoyed this book immensely, and I am looking forward to the sequel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|An absolutely free app and it is totally amazing because of new challenges every week and the objectives become hard every level. The updates are also amazing besides from the zipline and train an additional challenges were added. Absolutely time eater if one is bored. Graphics are good for my kindle but sometimes it is hard to open.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome! It is so addictive! I can't stop playing this game. I play it in the car and on the way to school. My high score is 674,951 what is everybody else's?

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had a hard time finding &#34;paperwhite&#34; in the description of Kindles this cord fits.  I took a guess this is the correct cord because the end seemed smaller...seemed.  It is correct and all's well that ends well.  Works perfectly.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|This was a gift for my a little northwest of normal daughter.  She has watched the whole series three times since I got it for her.  If I hear the opening tune one more time I will hurl.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book - very clever looking at it through the mans eyes. I loved out loud the whole way through this book. Highly recommend!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The first book was enough to get me started and wanting to read the 2nd book, but this Book has me wanting to read all the stories to find out what happens. There's suspense, drama, and of course some PG romance. Can't wait to read City of Glass.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is quite good. Nice retro feel to it, yet totally relatable on my phone! I have no problem with the controls. Seems pretty good for a mobile device game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is heart wrenching and will steal you're heart. As you go along the journey with Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters through their nice ride on the roller coaster that only goes up you will see their differences understand their suffering and see what true love really is. It's not about quantity, it's the quality of the time and memories they have together. Reading this book killed me slowly and flipped my heart as if it was only a quarter; but I don't regret it a single bit. The Fault in our Stars gave me a different perspective on life and death which I will carry with me forever.

B00ACHXHII|3.0|When I started collecting recordings, Silvestri was still alive and active, so for me some of these albums recall live experiences and others my first exposure to certain music.<br />Now I read on this page that he was an \\"underappreciated\\" conductor, even a \\"genius\\"! For this claim to stick, you would have to make a very, very long list of conductors in the public eye at that time and ask yourself the same question. Where are their recordings today?<br />I can only give you my personal collecting history as a guide.<br />Admittedly, Silvestri was a fine musician and there was a time and place when his enterprise was valuable and appreciated.<br />But sooner or later, other recordings appear. His account of the \\"warhorses\\" like Dvorak's or Tchaikovsky's symphonies or Rimsky didn't survive the comparison for very long. He was overtaken in short order by the names who are not \\"underappreciated\\" simply because their standards or insights, or their flair or mastery were higher (just to throw a few names around: Karajan, Szell, Reiner, Bernstein, Klemperer, Kubelik, Svetlanov, Kondrashin, Ormandy etc etc).<br />The \\"Lollipops\\" don't ask for \\"genius\\" conducting in the first place.<br />The one work here that earned encomia for its great brilliance was Elgar's \\"In the South\\", which at the time was a neglected masterpiece and very welcome. But his account is superseded today as well.<br />Silvestri survives today on the back of some recordings with great soloists (Menuhin, Oistrakh and others).<br />In a word: There isn't a single work on these disks that you could not buy elsewhere in a better performance/recordings.<br />So your warrant for acquiring them is not because of a conspicuously brilliant conductor, nor especially outstanding recordings, but simple curiosity (how did an average international conductor of the 50s-60s do these things?) or nostalgia. In the end, it is the music that counts:<br />The man with the stick has to be very, very good to deserve being immortalised along with them!rtalised along with them!
1476715904|5.0|This book made me get angry, cry...a lot by like page 4, laugh, get sad, get anxious, get desperate, and ultimately fall absolutely in love with these characters and this write.<br /><br />This is a book about loss and growing up. He easily demonstrates the profound sadness that one has when they've lost someone they love most in the world. It also shows how comfort can be found in many different forms of life and that grief takes many years to finally overcome enough to live again.<br /><br />Will...WOWZA!!!<br /><br />He's mature, sexy, emotional, and adorable in the way he falls for Lake. His adoration for her shows with their first encounter and just grows exponentially throughout the book. I loved that this book connected Will to Lake through the commonality of loss. He is there for her because he knows exactly what she has and will go through. No one else will get what Lake is going through except Will and what a great connection it makes.<br /><br />Lake - How adorable is she<br /><br />She's stronger than she thinks but not yet strong enough to deal with what she has to deal with in the coming years. Will is going to see her through her toughest years so far.<br /><br />This book is the story of Lake and Will finding each other and overcoming the adversities of life that are dealt to them. It reiterates that life goes on and family should be the most important thing in the world to all of us.<br />Without giving away any spoilers, the roller coaster begins on page one and isn't even over at the end...it continues in book two which I can't wait to read!<br /><br />What a great author, I loved her writing, her story telling and the emotions that she laid out on every page.<br /><br />A shout out to Jessica for telling me to read this book next...you have great taste <3<br /><br />To all those people out there that love books, take Jessica's - and now my - advice and read this book. But I warn you, get the tissue and keep it close, you'll need it but you'll love the story so much, you won't mind.
B00005N56Y|4.0|I have no hesitation acknowledging that Curzon and Britten are a formidable team. Their Mozart no. 20 is a truly dramatic account, full of the tragedy and grief that this score asks for. Despite the chamber orchestra backing, Britten's urgency and flair produce a sound here that makes no-one miss the larger orchestra which indeed the recording suggests. I can think of perhaps two or three other recordings in this class, but none that is better.<br />The competition in No. 27 is closer, mainly because of Gilels' magical account on DG with its autumnal colours perfectly realised. But Curzon and Britten match this standard, and a collector hardly needs any more assurance that this that Curzon's Mozart belong among the most eloquent and refined in the business.<br />However, the story is regretfully somewhat different with No. 23 and 24. These recordings clash inevitably head-on against one of the truly miraculous performances ever made in a recording studio. This is Kempff and Leitner with the Bamberg Symphony for DG, just a couple of years earlier. Far be it from me to call that recording \\"definitive\\", it would be a contradiction in terms. But \\"miraculous\\" meets the situation well. Kempff plays the work with such ease, grace and perfection that one can hardly think of a bar that is not infused with the authentic Mozartean spirit. It is music making of the rarest calibre, utterly natural and eschewing all point making. The fact that modern instruments were used has no bearing on the matter. The playing is so commanding, and the orchestral contribution so discretely attuned to the style that questions of style become irrelevancies. Moreover, the wide apart moods of the concertos are caught with consummate mastery, no. 23 inimitably songful and buoyant, no. 24 stern and tragic; and as far as the slow movement of the latter is concerned, I have yet to hear another pianist who can \\"speak\\" on the piano with the same unaffected, yet deeply touching simplicity.<br />Such gifts are too rare to expect them even once, let alone twice. Curzon is a fine and understanding Mozartean. He commands a pearly delivery that leaves little to be desired. But the ultimate Mozartean simplicity escapes him - as indeed it does the conductor who shows a tendency to press matters, to squeeze more dramatic juice out of the score than a pre-Beethoven score could or should. Compare the opening of no. 24: Here Leitner finds the perfect balance for the emotional menace that is held in check by the classical form, but would create turbulence in a romantic score. Kertesz, however, creates a highly charged atmosphere with powerful gestures - looking far ahead to Beethoven and almost leaving the pianist's entry as an anticlimactic moment (in the sense that the pianist now has to build up momentum a second time). In no. 23 one could hardly accuse Kertesz of being overly songful or gracious. In contrast, Curzon does his best in that regard, and his delightful scales and sensitive handling of the reflective episode make one wish that he could have found a more congenial partner - one who might have been genuinely attuned to his Mozartean manner. As it is the album has to yield first place, though it is by no means an account that falls below a high level of excellence. But the absence of magic tells in the long run. When it is there for the asking from Kempff, it is difficult to rouse greater enthusiasm than this.<br />Nevertheless, bearing in mind the overall quality of this album, it can be recommended without hesitation.s are too rare to expect them even once, let alone twice.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|I'm no literary expert, but I was disappointed in this book. It's development was slow and dragged in places. I finished it because I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The author seemed to stretch the ending to try to make it good, but I just wasn't into it.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I'd usually much rather be at the concert seeing the artist live but it is a pleasure to be able to experience this concert on dvd as well.  It is filmed in such a way that you feel you are sitting right next to Cohen on stage.  The music, the words, the tone is just lovely and personal.  It will pull you in and break your heart and then make you happy to be alive anyways.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Having read the first four books - and finding the fourth lacking - I nevertheless decided to read A Dance With  Dragons.  It's pretty clear that Martin has become bored and hasn't figured out how to bring all of the story lines to a fitting conclusion. So, he content to keep writing about this knight or that knight.  Interesting characters are less so now and new, boring ones are created. I encourage everyone to read the first three books in the series, yes! But know that if you keep reading beyond three, you'll be disappointed.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Good read but take notes if your like me and forget things easily and don't want to forget the characters.  This book is not for the those who don't like the challenge.I also encourage for you to get a group read then you can discuss what is going on and if you have questions along the way.  Take notes on a tablet or e--reader so you won't forget.

The information age has leveled the playing field, and the true talents of selling are now being demanded by the customer.  This book was not written to help sales people improve their sales abilities, rather it was written to inform most people that they too fall into one form of sales or another, sales selling or non-sales selling.  If you are familiar with Daniel Pinks writing, as usual he offers a lot of very good, researched information in an entertaining manner.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Liam Neeson. Enough said. I have yet to see him in a movie and not like it. The movie could be a complete flop, and he saves it every time. What's not to love.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Audrey Hepburn was a wonderful actress in this story about how difficult it was for a nun to follow the rules of her order.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|Laura Mvula's voice is amazing!!! What a breath of fresh air she is. I can't stop listening to her album.
B000067FP8|5.0|My wife loves the movie, too! They are strange animals, indeed! One little mistake in raising them, we're in for a big trouble.
B004H83IM8|4.0|Well I never like this series enough to pay full price but at $3 a movie it's well worth it.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is awesome. So awesome I finished it in one day. Hope to read Diary of a wimpy kid - The third wheel.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|I have loved listening to this beautiful lady ever since she appeared on the Talent show.  She has a gift like no other.
B00B2166BS|1.0|It tooks 8 hours to charge less than 50% of the battery of my Nexus 10. The micro usb cable is much faster.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Like most Jack Reacher novels, this one is action-packed from start to finish. The ending is cleverly woven into the story
B001RLP862|5.0|My dad had a set of these. After about 50 years, the faces of the cards were worn down but the cards were still in terrific shape. I bought this set for that quality. I bought these for my newly-wed granddaughter and hubby, who are game playing fanatics. They love them. One word of warning: The new deck is VERY slippery. Open them over the table and shuffle several times to get some of the &#34;new&#34; off.
B00B5AIB14|3.0|I don't know if this is me, although my husband agrees, this CD set sounds as though everything has been sped up on it.  It's disturbing.  Yes it's crisp and all those adjectives, but it is not like his other music.  I have researched him and listened to his music daily since the later 80's much as someone may read the bible and go to a church daily.  He is where I get my solice for all aspects of my life.  I know his music, movements, speed, tone etc... intimately and just found this particular CD set. disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Started a bit slow for me but then became very captivating, couldn't wait to get back to it to find out what happened next!
1609611543|5.0|I'm getting a lot of needed info (really needed by everyone) and my aligning with suggestions of this astounding book, am feeling better.<br />Highly recommended.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|After reading the Beautiful Creatures series I was in love. I could picture the characters and follow the storyline perfectly. Whoever decided to turn it into a movie had the right intentions but the wrong casting and killing of the books. The story line itself is horrible, they barely followed the book at all! The acting was horrible, the movie was horrible, total waste of money, wish it was a free rental because I certainly wasted my money.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I heard repeatedly that this was the best of the series so far--I liked Book Two better. But, that's splitting hairs because I did give this four stars. Just a few chapters where the girls bore you--a lot of walking, not much development. I guess it all comes together so nicely that I didn't mind a few bad chapters!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by this book. Reading it from a male POV, especially from Drew Evan's POV, was refreshing to say the least.  I have never met a more egotistical, arrogant, cocky, pompous jerk like Drew Evans was in the beginning of this book. He is handsome and he definitely knows it and uses it to his advantage. He is also a charmer though and brutally honest. He tells it like he sees it and the dialogue from Drew was witty, sarcastic, at times crass and crude and made me cringe, and I couldn't help it but fall for him towards the end of the book. His relentless pursuit of Kate was sweet, charming, cute, absolutely romantic, and FUNNY as hell.  Much of his internal dialogue is HILARIOUS and I don't think I have grinned and laughed so much while reading a novel.<br /><br />My only gripe was the many cuss words and the use of God's name in vain. I didn't think so many was necessary and detracted from my enjoyment of the book. A few sparse words here and there would have been okay and still would have not put Drew out of character so to speak.<br /><br />I am so glad Emma chose Kate as Drew's love. I instantly fell for the enemies/rivals to lovers storyline. The heated arguments were hilarious!!  Kate is Drew's ultimate match. She is ambitious, driven, outspoken, intelligent, confident, sassy, feisty, beautiful, and brings the \\"I am the absolute best at everything I do\\" Drew back down to earth and down on his knees. She is the ultimate challenge for Drew and she doesn't trust him. I just LOVE Kate because she doesn't give in after Drew really hurts her, and boy does she make Drew earn her apology and love.  Despite her intense attraction to Drew,she never gives in until Drew's final dramatic act of love which I thought was brilliant. I don't want to give anything away, but Drew's acts of love towards the end was very, very sweet and it changed how I felt about him.  He is just obsessed and in love with Kate and he sure showed it and I loved every second.  Emma Chase is very sneaky playing with my emotions about Drew :)<br /><br />I also loved Drew's relationship and interactions with Mackenzie, his 4 year old niece. She is absolutely adorable and I just wanted to hug her to bits. Drew loves her dearly and teaches her to have the mindset of being an independent, career and business savvy woman. He tells her she should be educated and smart and strong, so that she should never have to depend on a guy for any of her needs. One of the brilliant lines in the book from Drew,\\"Prince charming is a douchebag who is holding Cinderella back.\\" I just love that phrase and it is also one of the many reasons I fell for Drew.  Another hilarious scene was when Mackenzie changed the price of each bad word to 10 dollars and Drew was flabbergasted while he was arguing with Alexandra and Mackenzie just kept tap, tap, tapping away at her calculator adding up the price of each bad word. I am still smiling after thinking of that scene and many others with Mackenzie. She just steals the spotlight when she comes on and she is just so smart and inadvertently funny and cute. I just love her!!!<br /><br />Kate's best friend Dee Dee is another stand out character. Her appearance is completely at odds with what she does for a living. She's a chemist and she is not afraid to threaten any man who oversteps their boundaries with her or Kate. She is outspoken, smart, a little scary,and very loyal to Kate. I would love to have a best friend like Dee Dee because she isn't afraid to protect those she loves most and she uses her smarts, skills, and talents to do just that. She is just kick-ass to the extreme and I love her!!<br /><br />You are sure to fall in love with all the characters in this book like I did.  Drew's POV was definitely a  welcoming and entirely different kind of read. I look forward to the next in the series and more great books from Emma Chase!!
145211207X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moB3X4QFARO3AC]]I like the [[ASIN:0811833887 first Monsters Inc artbook]] and this one is great as well.<br /><br />There are more character designs. Mike and Sully are still the main characters but you'll also some a few familiar faces in their younger self in college. The monsters come in different shapes, sizes and colours. They are in sports, partying, playing pranks and coming up with all sorts of mischief.<br /><br />Since the film is about college life, you'll see more art of the Monsters University campus. When I think of monsters, I don't usually associate them with bright and cheery hilly campus, but that's what you get with a Pixar film. You have Mike and Sully jogging in the stadium at dawn with sun casting a beautiful warm glow. It seems there's always a colourful party going on somewhere. The campus has several buildings and the main one is the School of Scaring. You'll also see the dorm rooms, fraternity houses and areas of Monsters Inc that are not shown in the first film.<br /><br />The interviews with the artists and staff provide some insight into the design of the film. They talk about the differences and similarities between the two films, such as the old school scaring technology that you'll see.<br /><br />It's a great book with lots of beautiful concept art.<br /><br />Be sure to check out the first Monsters Inc artbook as well, which was sold out and reprinted.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a keeper for those days when you need a pick-me-up light romance to lift you out of the chivalry-is-dead-bah-humbug blues. Quite improbable story line, but what are fairy tales for, anyway?
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Seriously, best show ever! The first show that both me and the hubby watch together. Just go ahead and watch it already!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is amazingly accurate with it's V7.1 Surround. Extremely comfortable and look good as well. Also holds a charge for 10 hours, which the software for Logitech will notify you when it is low and when it will be fully charged after you plug it in.
B000B8QF14|3.0|I ordered this without being told it was a European DVD and I wouldn't be able to play it in any of my DVD players at home
B008M721MS|5.0|No more worry now that the young travellers in my family can call within seconds and can hear and see them to encourage them or rejoice with them, a home away from home.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book explicitly defines what it takes to be a navy SEAL sniper, what happens to family life while on tours and the horror of war.  I've read several books on SEAL's but this is the best one yet.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Great product, you can search and view youtube videos before downloading and downloading videos couldn't be easier. You can log in to your account linked to youtube and view your playlists.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I really enjoy this game! The only complaint against it is that it was entirely too short! I was able to finish the entire game within a matter of hours. I love hidden object games and this one had a puzzle twist but it was not as challenging as I would have liked.
B00BFV1K2A|5.0|THE HUNGER GAMES TRILOGY<br /><br />The only major error in this peRfectly realized trilogy --of a world in which tyrrany is absolute-- is its classification: for \\"Young Adult\\" readers. Given that there is no sex in it more graphic than a few diaphanous hints of arousal, but much violence, including cold-blooded killing, One must conclude that the \\"censors\\" who rate books consider mayhem acceptable while sexuality is not.  This is obviously \\"their\\" problem, and should not color our impressions of the story Ms. Collins relates.<br /><br />In what we might call a near-future, alternate world (with similarities to our own that are perhaps  too disturbing to contemplate), The Capital has long ago vanquished an uprising in the Provinces.  As a reminder of its victory and as entertainment for its own jaded population, each year the Capital hosts the Hunger Games.  One male and one female from each Province are chosen by lot to participate in the Games, the object of which is to kill all the others.<br /><br />The heroine of all three novels is Katniss, a young girl of laxly governed Province 12 who hunts game beyond the Fence and sells it to the mayor and other dignitaries.  Katniss is of course a Tribute in the next annual Games; we know she's got a rebellious streak, which doesn't appear in public til the final scene of the games:  an act so stunning in its imlications she incurs the wrath of the President.  Katniss' final kill sets the stage for a far more egalitarian society.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy goes on my list of \\"Must reads\\" for \\"young adults\\" of all ages.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Watching this movie after the fact proves that the fist big corporate business in the tobacco industry, or any industry for that matter, can hold over their employees. And what they will resort to in order to keep corporate secrets, secret. They are able to use any form of intimidation to keep them in line. Jeffery's life was ruined, when he chose the right path, and blew the tobacco industry out of the water. You won't recognize Russell Crowe as Dr. Jeffery Wigand, he was nominated for a best actor oscar. Al Pacino plays Lowell Bergman, executive producer for \\"60 Minutes\\", also does a fantastic job. Wigand is the whistle blower, and it turns his life upside down. That's all I will say about the plot, but I will say the sound track is incredible, it's not the same thought provoking story without it. 5 stars, period.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|How did he survive ?<br /><br />By luck I guess.<br /><br />What a horrible life to live. I can never complain about anything, ever again.<br />I hope North Korea fall sooner than later
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this cd.  But then I only became a fan of Rod when he came out with The American Song Book cd's which I love.  This cd reminded me of his earlier years.
B000002WPI|5.0|This album is such a great album! The rhymes are very thought out. I barely listen to the new school of rappers and this is my first Wu Tang album that I bought and it was such a great purchase!
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Great movie - I was surprised but sine it was rated 4 stars decided to try it.  The scenery was awesome!  Would highly recommend it to all ages.
B008OHV5W8|5.0|This is a great go to collection for putting together yoga playlists. It has some really great tracks for savasana/relaxation as well. I really love it.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I had wanted something to draw on my kindle,  and I stumbled upon this very app. It 's called 'Draw Something ' but you can't draw ANYTHING!!!!!!!  :-( +Rolls eyes+ After I'm done righting this review I am going to delete it. I advise everyone not to get this app.
B007SXB498|3.0|The society was very interesting,but it first frustrated me and then engaged me, because everyone was concealing their true feelings, to save every other person from emotional pain, embarrassment, or having something to gain, usually money. Then the characters grew on me and I was caught up in their fates
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|Played this on my kindle. This game will only let you build one house before you have to pay to unlock the next level. It's a good game, but it's not free so I uninstalled it.
B001HN69AY|5.0|It is completely mind blowing and you spend a good portion of the movie wondering what is going on and then all of a sudden it just hits you! Sooooooooo GOOOOOOD
B002M85TH2|5.0|this movie has always impressed me.  John Travolta plays a heartless logical hero with ruthless goals to save the USA from terrorists.  If you think about it, his goal is a good one.  On the other hand, he could have come up with a better way to get his bank roll.  Well acted, tense, probably will be considered a classic in 50 years.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Let me just say that no- it's not free. Why they can't just say Trial is beyond me. Free games come with tons of annoying advertisements anyway. This game has a loooong free trial with no ads. Well worth it. It didn't cost .99 and it wasn't $5 either. Somewhere in the middle. Worth it anyway. G5 games very rarely disappoint.  Storyline, graphics, several levels of expertise and the games within the game are outstanding. I had no problems at all on a Kindle Fire. In the Casual mode, hints are plenty and rejuvenated quickly. Since I play for fun it was perfect. Not frustratingly difficult and not too easy to bore me. Just right. Have fun playing! I did. :)
0345529057|5.0|I chose this rating because I honestly cannot put the book down.  There are so many twists and turns so far in the series that it will always have you guessing and gasping.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Fracture reminded me of an Alfred Hitchcock movie, great cast, fantastic story line and a lot of suspense.  No doubt I would watch this movie again and still enjoy it in much the same way as the first time I had seen it.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Wonderful, an inspiration to all of us and helping us understand that it is our passion for our<br />profession that keeps us going, not the money or acolades.
B008E9R50C|4.0|I would probably give it three and a half stars if I could.  Lisa writes very easy to read books, I have read better ones but I quite enjoyed it. One aspect I found irritating was the condemnation the sniper received when he was only doing his job but perhaps that's because I live in south Africa where unfortunately we become hardened to violence!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Currently I am still reading this book. I am completely amazed at the style of writing (a sort of Q/A) of some of the important survivors of the apocalypse. There are many names for the apocalypse Z War One or World War Z are the main ones. Max incorporates ideas of Politics, Technology, Economics, Culture, and Military Tactics into a story about the undead. He explains how the infection spreads and how the U.S. being the arrogant buffoons we are don't do anything about it at all. Infact the only Countries that take the threat seriously are Israel and (sort of) Cuba. It is cool to see how all of our modern military is for the most part ineffective against the Zombies. This book is an amazing example of modern literature written by a future great author of the next generation! but I do have one question for Max, if Zombies are guided to consume human fles and brain matter why do they not use their stomachs?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my favorite horse game<br />with lots of different horses u can choose from and name them I named my sodapop because that's my horse name in life and I love horses very much
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Darker than the movie portrayed.  The story wasn't over once the witch was gone.  The story didn't have a good flow to it.  A lot of characters were brought in and glossed over.
B008458O3S|4.0|Neither I nor my grandchild understood the purpose of this app, but it was fun nonetheless and a good price (zero).
B004DNWPY4|4.0|This is the second time I have read this book. The insights and advice offered are still extremely valuable. My only criticism concerns the age of the data and studies. More current information offered in a newer revision would be a welcome read.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|This product was entirely too challenging for me, and frustrating because I couldn't get past the third level...you have to have great hand-eye coordination for this one.  I'd probably like it if I were younger.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the boom it is so fun because when my head  hurts I just turn on subway surfers
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I have rented many movies from Amazon through my wifi blueray player. I have never had an issue. This movie had a HORRENDOUS picture! It was digitized/blurry throughout the entire playback. I even shut everything down and restarted, and it did not make a difference. The awful picture made it hard to watch. I am extremely disappointed.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a great family movie for Father's day. The loss of a child cause one man to take a better look at the Word of God and he finds many scriptures that show him how to be the head of the family. His talks to his friends and they all make a pledge to protect, defend and guide their families in the right way.  It's a heart warming story of love and dedication to the cause of Christ and family.<br />I watch it often.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|This band rocks, the CD is pure magic to my ears. The CD covers combine to actually make a house of gold n bones as well. Creative.
B00005JMCN|4.0|Good story, but the language was a little strong in some parts. I even bought this one for my son-in-law, who loves movies about horses.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Rarely do I try a workout on DVD that is shorter than 45 minutes where I feel really challenged and like I am pushing it to the limit. JM always delivers! Yet another winner from the best I've found!!
1451627297|5.0|So, I read Hearts of Atlantis, and it was drudgery.  I read all the early King books and The Stand is my favorite.  I was looking for something different to read--tired of lawyer and detective books, and I saw the date, 11/22/63 pop out at me.  My in-laws anniversary...wait it was the day Kennedy died.  Read the cover and thought, I'll give King another chance.  11/22/63 is for this reader his best yet.  While it is not a horror book, horrific things happen.  Jake Epping's surreal ride into the Fifties and Sixties made me want to learn more.  Maybe, I'll watch some old sci-fi.  I think what gets me best is that King intertwines so many different genres.  I truly enjoy the raw sensation of love that exists between George and Sadie.  How can  you not want them to be together?  Still, King always brings us back to the darkness that exists in humanity, but now the light is at the end of the tunnel.
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|the sound quality was terrible.  There was a crackling sound throughout the entire movie.  this was not your usual audio quality.
B005R32L66|5.0|So glad that my boyfriend had me get a Skype account - the long-distance savings is incredible!  Love the video calls.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I have other &#34;Flo&#34; games including DIner Dash on my PS3. Playing on my phone and using my finger to point to where I need to her go next and queue up commands is very nice and smooth. Seems more intuitive than using a controller.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|I just wish I had could have been there!  A little grittier than Albert Hall, but really has Joe playing at his best.  This has several guests which add to the variety on this DVD.  The only thing better than this is to see him in person!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I downloaded this book in 2010 and any time I'm between books, I just read it over again. I think Tina Fey is one of the most brilliant comedians out there right now (and I mean comedians, not lady comedians). Now that &#34;30 Rock&#34; has ended, I am excited to see what she does next. I kind of hope she writes another book, though its hard to imagine a second book being as funny and full of heart as this one.
1608955702|5.0|I liked it a lot. It is very good and very helpful. It taught me a lot of tricks that I didn't know!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This *Turtle Beach PX21 Gaming Headset* is a WAY more than average *gaming headset*. I opened up the securely packed PX21 headset and have had no need of using the instruction manual to quickly figure out how to hook it into my fairly current desktop PC. It has what are obvious UPS-3 and analog signal jacks -- which easily fit in just where they looked like they should. So, I jacked into front UPS-3 and flank analog audio holes and fiddled around with the convenient controls [just a short arm distance down the headset cable] -- which has a convenient clip good for shirts, jackets [or wherever nearby] to anchor the little control module. I have tried different combos of the *game*, *bass*, *mike* and *chat* controls -- and I like that I can easily hear gaming or music audio clearly while I try any control combo. The enhanced stereo *expander* does reduce the music quality just a wee bit [to my sharp ears] -- but with the payback of very enhanced around sound angles. With that off -- and with the *bass* control maxed -- I can hear my pure music very well -- including fairly distinct angles of instruments even without the stereo-angle enhancement [*expander*] activated. I do not hear any kind of hiss with that combo either. This headset is very comfortable and very adjustable -- with nice feeling cloth-covered earpieces -- that I can easily expand around a medium head-cap when I like to. So, I will be using this headset for all my main interests -- gaming, movie and music. My Win 7 HP [fairly current] desktop PC had no trouble hooking up drivers when I jacked in this *Turtle Beach PX21 Gaming Headset* -- so fast I did not even notice any activation delay as I put on the headset -- it was operational before the driver hook up was noted on my desktop. Very impressive +++
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved, loved,loved this book!! Written from a man's perspective, it's flipping hilarious!  I read so much of this book to my husband and even he said \\"yep that's pretty right on!\\"<br />Emma uses such great detail, it's like your right there with the characters. I love the way she has Drew use analogies to help the female readers understand a man's mind!!<br />I would recommend this book to all my friends!
B00BB22GQM|3.0|This album underwhelmed and leaves you wanting to love it but you just can't. Every album of theirs has been different but this one feels like they took something away that was too central and it is noticeable. The fun \\"uppity-ness\\" is toned down, a lot. I am all for changing it up, I just don't think this is a \\"homerun\\", \\"must get\\" or \\"best album of the year\\" kind of material. This band will be around for a while because there is just something about their sound that people really relate to. They are truly unique. Modern Vampires of the City is okay, just okay.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I saw the movie before, so I knew what was gonna happen even so I Found myself surprised. Excellent writing and it goes beyond the movie in complexity and intelligence. Love both but please take them both. Not just the movie or the book both and we trapped. The afterword is probably the best ever written. Thank you Chuck
B00CRW2066|5.0|The National expand their sound by nuance and subtlety in their new album. Since Alligator, the National's albums have each been defined by a particular &#34;sound.&#34; Alligator had a more progressive alternative feel, Boxer was the slow burner and High Violet was the rumble of a deep guitar. Trouble Will Find Me features the National as a softer, but more layered band. Rather than add to the volume of its predecessor, The National blanket their sound in layers of sound in the form of blended electronic rhythms, gently floating behind the quiet rumble of their brooding sounds, harmonizing (still baritone, of course) vocal sections, and their trademark building, growing sound that builds with such constraint, but so much soul.<br /><br />This is a fantastic album and one of my favorites thus far from 2013.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Two major deal breakers for me.  Back to the weather Channel app.  The interface isn't that bad but definitely feels cluttered.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book to end the series.  It was pretty fast pass and very easy to read. Very much enjoyed it like all the res
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Very well done with an excellent cast. This was a trying time and the faults and problems of a poor administration are shown for what they were - not too capable! Those interested in what happened should also see the PBS version which is a bit more factual! Nevertheless - a very good production.

B0084I3E3A|3.0|I bought a used copy of this book for school and didn't know there was an online test you had to take after reading the book to find out what your personal strengths are.  Of course the code on the book jacket was not good because someone else had already used it so I will have to pay an additional $9.99 to the company in order to take the test.  The test was kind of the whole point of the book.  It would have cost me less to just purchase a new copy of the book.

B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I listened to the book on tape and loved it.  I couldn't wait to see the movie.  The story was so rich and the movie was thin and shallow.  Why did they take a perfectly good story and destroy it?  I hated this movie.
B009K6DKTS|4.0|An important work that exposes the shallowness of prevalent mental models of analysis, in a world that is rife with uncertainties.  The writing is peppered with flashes of brilliance alternating with meandering prose.  Tight editing to cut down the length of the book would make for more engaging reading.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|Sure, it is a little weird playing a game where the objective is to annihilate the human race through a evolved bacteria, virus, prion (think of mass cow disease), or even a virus that turns humans into zombies! A hyper-realistic game where every decision, mutation ( whether it was caused by you or the mutation evolved randomly), has consequences that will effect the final outcome of the game. You make your virus too deadly then it kills all the pathogen's hosts before it has time to be transmitted to the rest of the world, you make your virus highly transmissible then the scientists and doctor will have easily cure it by exploring one of transmission vectors. A truly brilliant, well thought provoking,

Fascinating environment for this story of intrigue.
B00CS7ZXFK|5.0|The Beach Boys' first concert album was the Beach Boys Concert released in 1964.  It sounded like they sounded on the records.  In the 1970s and 1980s, the Beach Boys updated their songs with a heavy rock influence covering their vocals with lots of guitar distortion. It was okay but the music didn't much sound like the original hits. Finally, in this 50th anniversary tour, the Beach Boys went back to sounding much like they did on the original records and CDs they released in the 1960s and onwards.  In all, it's a big welcome.  Who would have thought 70 year-old men could sound so good.  This is the best of all their concert albums.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|It was a little tricky at first for me to get used to... the touch, how the watch operates, etc..but with a little practice, I think I've got the hang of the basics.  Most important, it was a REAL asset for me during my first race, a half marathon, yesterday.  I've trained almost primarily on the treadmill, so... having a watch that gave me my time, my pace... how far I had gone - was very helpful to me for pacing myself out - and for mentally getting through the race.  I have no regrets!  LOVE this watch!! It also gave me my average heart rate.  A+++++  A friend of my sisters runs marathons and half marathons - has had the watch for 4+ years, no problems.  I bought the watch with her recommendation - and it was a good choice!

B001UGB1X8|2.0|So from reading other reviews I gather this is a book loosely based on a series of books.  I watched this movie with no pre-conceived expectations hoping for a gritty, gruesome, intelligent thriller.  What we got instead was a re-run of every other Tommy Lee Jones tough-cop \\"out-house and doghouse\\" movie, combined with a confusing plot with a convenient ending that left us screaming \\"what?!\\" at the TV.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones was unconvincing in the lead role being noticeably aged since the last time I watched one of his films.  The actor's age and noticeable limp/stiff leg walk made him look ancient for the role.  The character's frequent too easily executed roughing up of everyone from mafia-like heavies to random street hoods begged the question how the character had made it this far in his career without being whacked before now.  Other characters were one-dimensional, notably the drunk hollywood moviestar and his girlfriend (straight out of Agatha Christie!), John Goodman as the mafia-like boss, and numerous others.  The FBI detective was bizarrely deferential to the main detective character, responding to all blatant acts of aggression and illegality with a tut-and-shake-of-the-head motion, perhaps a look of slight bafflement and then acting like nothing had happened.<br /><br />The plot itself was mystifying, with numerous threads that the Tommy Lee Jones' main character conveniently linked together in a series of baffling hunches that always worked out.  In other places there were holes big enough to drive a tank through.  For all of the \\"series of grisly murders\\" referred to in the description of this movie none of the victims are developed in any way.  The FBI-referenced history of serial killing is limited to just that, a reference, with no development or expansion into why the FBI are even really involved (The agent certainly doesn't add anything to the investigation).  The whole movie descends into nothing more than an examination of the main character's virtues and attempts to get to the truth.  And when we get into the 'ghosts' that appear in the middle of the story, it just becomes totally unbelievable.  As the plot wraps up, loose ends are brushed aside, leads left untapped, and questions left unanswered.  And for those who have seen the movie, can anyone explain why the daughter character says \\"Dave?\\" while looking a picture of John Bell Hood right before the credits roll?  That resulted in popcorn being thrown at the TV!<br /><br />All in all, there was potential here, but terrible casting, execution, one-dimensional characters and a half-baked story line make this entirely missable.er's virtues and attempts to get to the truth.

B00AFEYUVG|5.0|In my opinion it is a movie every one should see, maybe over the age of 14 and yes their parents need to see it to.  One moment in the movie makes it great.  I am by no means a young man being 62 but I learned much about why I had made the mistakes I had made why they happened maybe for the first time.<br /><br />Most of all young and mature women should see this film and if it does not open your eyes then you don't have any.  I was shocked at how good it was and was never really never marketed in the United States.  Most thoughtful film I have maybe ever seen.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game, very addicting.My son really likes to play this also. I wish it came with more hearts so I could play longer between rounds. Linking to facebook gets you more.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This replacement is much better than the cord that came with my Kindle Fire (which died withing 2 months of its replacement from Amazon) and another that I'd purchased from amazon.  This one is much nicer and because it's a USB cable, I can use it in my car when I travel.  Perfect for when I want to take a restop break while traveling or connecting my Kindle Fire to listen to MP3s through my cars speakers.
B00AKKS278|5.0|I actually met Hal Elrod on a flight home from San Diego. he was en route to Seattle to give a motivational presentation.  Hal was listening to a conversation I was having with a colleague and turned around and first apologized for overhearing us, then offered me a copy of his book. I graciously accepted, not knowing why he offered it to me or what he might have thought I needed it. I have since read the book and have implemented each practice described in the book. I now have focus and a clear vision of where and what I want to have and be in my life.  I highly recommend this book. It will get and keep you focused on fulfilling your level 10 life.<br /><br />Thank you Hal!
B000IMUYJM|5.0|I'll start by saying that this is my kind of horror film. There is no excessive blood and gore, no torture scenes, and no excessive cursing. Just suspenseful old school scares, and a mysterious stalker we do not get to see or know much of. Black Christmas set the standard for films of its kind. It would be nice to have films like this now days. I really enjoyed this movie and advise it to horror/slasher fans.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|The trouble with having Khaled Hosseini as your name and writing as your profession is that no matter how hard you try, your works will always be compared to your piece de resistance, The Kite Runner. While the debut novel of Hosseini let the literary circuits on fire and was quickly adapted to a namesake film too, the new work by him fails to create the magic again. I have gone through the work twice in a soan of eight days, the second time in a bid to search for the all important connection that I so lovingly made with the characters in The Kite Runner, but alas, there was none to be.<br /><br />Hosseini keeps the base intact as his earlier two novels- War torn Afghanistan, the protagonist(s)' lives changing on account of the tumult etc.<br /><br />where the novel fails, and a momentous failure it is, is that the author fails to keep the emotional crescendo sustained. The novel works brilliantly towards the middle, where the reader misses a heartbeat or two on Pari discovering her brother, again. But the crescendo quickly turns flat, a cola without fizz, a plateau and never works up again. As I write this, I also realise that in the true sense, there are no protagonists or antagonists - there are too many characters. Just too many. Unlike The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, which had focus on characters and developed them in flesh and bone, the current work burdens itself with creation of unnecessary characters, reeling across three generations. A lot of irrelevant time is spent on characters like Markos, Thalia etc. and at the risk of sounding brusque, I dare say that this seems like an attempt to add volume to the work, sans real content. The real heroes are muddled in page after page of unnecessary description of decrepit characters, and it shows.<br /><br />Hosseini tries and stays true to his roots, beautiful wordplay, stirring emotions, but these are too far spaced out and too many.<br /><br />In the end, And The Mountains Echoed buried itself under its own burden, and leaves the reader with a tingling sensation of having reached the epitome of emotional upheaval, but not quite. I write this review with mixed feelings of disappointment and ennui which I so clearly never thought will be the adjectives associated with a work of a reputed author like Hosseini.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I received 500 coins from Amazon and have wanted to try this game for quite a while but with being 7.00 dollars I didn't want to buy once it went to 99 cents I figured I would give it a try.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app on a Kindle Fire HD but the reason I really love this app is because I'm a desktop user too and the desktop version is killer.  The great thing is evernote keeps all my notes synced up so I can see the notes and notebooks I made on my desktop when I'm away from my desk using my Kindle.  I almost didn't try this app because it wanted me to create an account.  I've used this for 30 days and when I started to write the review I realized that I had actually made more notes at the desktop than at the Kindle.  At this point, I find the desktop version a little more intuitive than the Kindle adroid app but then I have done so much more with the desktop version.  I've  added clipped selections of web pages, I added entire web pages, I've created 20 notebook with 137 notes, I've took screen shoots and added them to notebooks while I was installing a surveillance camera, I created grocery and to do list with bullit list, numbers, and checklist.  The checklist have little boxes rather than numbers and you can go back and put a check in them.  30 days is important because you have a 60MB monthly upload allowance for 30 day unless you go premium.  Premium is a monthly charge not just a different app.  Just for personal notes the price of $5.00 per month ot $45.00 for individual was too high for my use.  I really saved a lot of webpages, screenshots, clippings, pictures, and notes over the last 30 days that I normally would not have done and I still only got to 34M of my upload allowance and after the 30 days my allowance was reset to 0.  There was one firmware upgrade during my 30 days and I installed it and all my notes and note books were still in order.  There is so much more to this app both on the Kindle and desktop that I haven't touched but I'll be seeing how much more I can kick the tires over the next 30 days.  This is savng me so many of those little notes you write at your desk and I can still see it all when I'm at the Kindle and evernote keeps it all in sync for me.  This app almost makes me wish my tracfone was a little smarter so I could use it on my phone too....back to noting...if I have more after the next 30 days I'll add that.in sync for me.

B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I absolutely loved these 3 books. I watched the 3 original swedish movies as well as the one with Daniel Craig. The books obviously has a lot more detail in them. I loved the movies but the books are beyond compare.  Suspense like I've never read before, the story still has a very human aspect to it and I actually came to love Lisbeth Salander. The absolutely cruelty humans can inflict on each other is portrayed with shocking clarity, which makes the main characters so much more real and heroic. These books are \\"unputdownable\\". Apparently Stieg Larrson was planning on writing a series of 12 but died before he could finish, so I appreciate the 3 books he did finish. I recommend these books to any adult who likes suspense with the human touch.
B004LWZW6K|3.0|\\"Piranha DD\\" is exactly what you would expect with that title: deadly fish with attitudes invade an adult water park. Questions?<br /><br />I gave the film three stars, one each for David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd, and Gary Busey, who all did their part to bring this fishy thriller to life. Sadly, the opening scene involves Gary Busey and a farting cow, and does not go well allowing Busey to leave the set early. Would you believe Christopher Lloyd as a mad scientist? His role is more substantial than Busey's, but the big ticket star of the show is David Hasselhoff, who gets a choice part that even features a prophetic line of dialogue, \\"Welcome to rock bottom.\\" Mostly the film stars big-chested women you've never heard of and will likely never hear from again in a plot involving a water park in which the lifeguards have been replaced by strippers.<br /><br />The plot proceeds about like you'd expect (hyper-smart fish that can pierce solid steel on the warpath against nubile youngsters) and great scenes like the piranha interruptus scene (concluding in a terrible dilemma with a butcher knife,) or my personal favorite moment involving a love van, handcuffs, prayer, and piranhas all adding to a cohesive whole. Diverse plot elements such as a sheriff with a combination prosthetic leg/shotgun and the ultimate (deserved) clotheslining scene in movie history makes this almost as good as an average SyFy aquatic animal feature. For those of you interested in good local governance, there's even a subplot about the high cost of the municipal water supply!<br /><br />There are a lot of bonus features, including deleted scenes, \\"The Story Behind Piranha DD,\\" \\"The Hofftastic World of David Hasselhoff,\\" and by far the best reason to own the DVD, a short film titled \\"A Lesson With John McEnroe,\\" which made the remainder of the DVD worthwhile.<br /><br />I recommend this piranha movie primarily due to the presence of its tennis lesson.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|This old-school style drama is a cinematic achievement that is filled with tension, drama, and heartache.  If you favor new-school action films, many of which are action montages that don't require a story line, you may want to look elsewhere.  Part of this film's success lies in its spacing.  Scenes of intense man-against-nature struggles are punctuated by the drama of a woman who is desperately trying to save them. Acting is top-notch, and the mountain scenes, which are bleak and almost monochromatic, will have your adrenaline pumping.  When they are forced to bivouac, you might find yourself shivering against the unrelenting wind and snow.  The protection gear of that period - canvas, wool, and leather, makes the cold seem even more intense. You can feel the frigid gales piercing right through it.  This film is a great ride that is best experienced with a good sound system.  A big screen is not necessary - I watched it on my Kindle fire with my Klipsch S4 ear buds and the volume cranked up, and I felt as if I was on the mountain with them.

B008220C38|1.0|Although this film is not without some positive attributes, i.e. fantastic cinematography & great actors, I find myself wondering why it was called \\"Anna Karenina\\" since this beautiful story was butchered and bears only cursory resemblance to the original. It felt very much like a slowed down music video with similar dumbed down plot lines. There is a dance scene which is ridiculous in the extreme. No one in 19th century Russia, in fact no one in the world today does such insane gyrations in the name of dance. And I'm sorry to say that the numerous sex scenes were unable to raise this ill conceived monstrosity from a laughable waste of two plus hours. I must say that I was intrigued by the device of using a stage proscenium setting to set up the scenes. This was quite nicely done. To have utterly sacrificed the brilliant original story to a very lame so called love story is quite unforgivable. Sample revisions: Anna does not throw herself into an oncoming train and her lover in fact dumps her to forgo a scandal which would ruin his professional life. Conquest complete, self interest prevails. Did the screenwriter even bother to read the original? This modern reworking of a great classic is dull, overwrought, and ridiculous in the extreme. It should have been called Molly Jones since it is not Anna Karenina.

B00CATSONE|2.0|Author Patrick begins by telling us that the relation between IQ and success follows the law of diminishing returns. Increasingly important, given a base level of ability, is the intensity of the individual's effort. Swedish psychologist Anders Ericsson encapsulated this into the \\"10,000 hour\\" rule - mastery takes around 10,000 hours of focused, intentional practice. That's about four hours/day, seven days/week, for seven years. (Actually, his theory also asserts that talent is irrelevant - an idiotic overextension of what may be a partial truth.<br /><br />Malcomb Gladwell seized upon this theory and rode it to best-seller status in his 'Outliers.' One example provided - those born just after a birthdate cutoff for participating in sports or entering school. Gladwell dwells on the extra year of practice this allows those youngsters; true, but there's also the matter of the extra year of mental and physical growth. And talent doesn't matter?<br /><br />Unfortunately, reading this first chapter is a waste of one's time, and a prelude of what's to come. The essence of this book is to use bits of Tesla's life to justify various theories of human exceptionalism, and is not worth reading. I'd suggest 'Tesla' by Carlson, instead.

An ousted former agent is recalled to find the mole.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, etc.  I suppose the story is OK, but it just didn't do much for me.  I can't recommend this one.

B00005JMEW|5.0|- The best thing about this movie is its Hilarious dialogues.<br />One instance is the scene where Uma Thurman arriving at a Japanese restaurant. The waiter said to the owner \\"I could have become a general because I've been working for you for so long\\". The owner said\\"....\\". It made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Another example is the scene where the male nurse said to his patient \\"My name is Buck...\\"<br /><br />- Some of the action scenes are intense and have twists that make them so entertaining.<br />An example is the scene where Uma had just killed all of the bad guys with her sword but one. I thought she was going to kill him too. Instead she...<br /><br />- For instance, another scene where Uma was fiercely fighting with a brown woman when her child came back from school. Then the two stopped fighting and talked gently to the kid. When she went out of their sight, suddenly the fighting resumed with deadly consequence.<br /><br />- The acting is okay.<br /><br />- Of course, I have to suppress my logic to enjoy this film.<br />In short, it's one of The BEST that My MONEY CAN GET in terms of COMEDY.
B007ME5BUG|4.0|I am not an expert on W.W. II but the book seems well written and well researched. I haven't found anything in Beevor's facts or his analysis so far that makes me regret buying the book. If you're looking for a good over-view of the second world war, this would be a good option and- in my humble opinion- worth the price. Of course, I still think that no history of the War can hold a candle to Shirer's \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\\" (Also available on Kindle for about the same price) Shirer has the advantage of having been a journalist in Europe in the period leading up to the War and having personally known and in many cases personally interviewed some of the major players in the German, French and English governments of the time. But, if you've already read Shirer, Beevor's book is definitely worth a read.
B00005JMUA|1.0|Compared to volume 1, it's obviously volume 2 was rushed to the theatres without  proper plot and directing.<br /><br />- The dialogues are not humorous as the one in volume 1. They are boring.<br /><br />- The flow is choppy which makes the film more tiring.<br /><br />In short, it's bad in every aspect compared to volume 1.<br />The only reason people need to watch this is to have a conclusion to the movies.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|With so many reviews, it is hard to imagine there is something I can say which has not already been said, except to add my vote to the chorus of five star reviews. The film is a strange mixture of Star Wars action / adventure and Blade Runner suspense. Lead character Malcolm Reynolds, played to a tee by Nathan Fillion, is far more the hard as nails Rick Deckard than he is the carefree Han Solo. He has strong loyalties to his crew and to those who help him in his shadowy half legal / half bandit role as an old fashioned highwayman of the 'verse (contraction for \\"universe\\").<br /><br />The heavy, an Alliance \\"Operative\\" has the determination of an unturned Terminator, who is a lot smarter and more wily than the humanoid androids (and smarter than the replicants of \\"Blade Runner\\", although the final fight between Reynolds and The Operative is vaguely reminiscent of the fight between Deckard and Roy Batty.<br /><br />The plot resolves two of the biggest questions arising out of the world of the \\"Firefly\\" series. Why are Alliance agents so intent of recovering control of the mysterious River Tam. The opening of the story proper (after a flashback on River's rescue) shows part of why she is so valuable. She is psychic, reliably. It doesn't come and go. It is not hit and miss. She saves the crew's bacon more than once by using that ability. The second question, not explored deeply in the series, is what is the origin of the \\"Reavers\\". It is hard to say more without giving away the surprise resolution.<br /><br />The special effects are primitive, and a lot of laws of physics are given too little attention, such as the famous problem of gravity while in outer space. Unlike the compulsively accurate Stanley Kubrick (or James Cameron), and like virtually everyone else, the problem is ignored. The space ship design would probably work in space, but it's ability to land from and take off to space, and fly in the atmosphere, seems quite improbable. But none of that seems to matter, because the story is so, so good.<br /><br />The cast is strong, and it is great to see Ron Glass (of Barney Miller fame) in a role. Most of the characters have a depth to them, such as Adam Baldwin, who plays the heavy weapons toting \\"Animal Mother\\" character he created in \\"Full Metal Jacket\\", but his backstory (shown better in the movie than in the series) is delightful, as he regularly communicates with his mother. The most interesting is the triangle between Malcolm the captain, Zoe, his second in command, and her husband, Wash, the pilot. Zoe and Malcolm fought in the rebellion before Zoe met Wash, and there is sometimes a conflict between, command, duty, and loyalty.<br /><br />And... there are two of the most unusual fight scenes you will ever see... Can't say more about that.<br /><br />This is more than worth the cost of admission (whoever, the squeamish may cash in before the film is over.)er, because the story is so, so good.<br /><br />The cast is strong, and it is great to see Ron Glass (of Barney Miller fame) in a role.

B00992CF6W|3.0|It's fun for a while but once u accomplish everything, there's nothing to do. No cool mobs or monsters, and the nether sucks. Only updates every so many months. It gets old.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read about a book every week or two.  This book took a day.  LOVED it so much i'm doing my first review! GREAT, FUNNY, ENTERTAINING READ.  As soon as I finished, I was searching for another book by EMMA CHASE!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Really good fun and awesome game u should download this,but it takes 30 min or something to download it but it's WORTH IT
0767812387|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF VANESSA WILLIAMS BEST DANCE MOVIES THAT SHE DID WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER, NICE MOVIE TO WATCH ON SUNDAYS WITH YOUR FAMILY
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It lets you make a person a friend and fire rain lightning axes snow and more it's pretty cool<br /><br />!!!!!!!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|First off, let me just say that this is one of the best purchases I've made in a long time. I absolutely love this.<br /><br />since you are in the reviews, you have probably already seen the negative ones about how easily the nib slips off of the pen. This isn't as bad as it sounds. I too was really worried that it would be really cheap and break or run out of ink extremely quickly. IT IS NOT. The regular ink nib is more than perfect. I love writing with it and it has saved my life more than once in classes where I didn't have any black ink pens. It is pretty flawless after you figure out the way to properly uncap it. You just hold onto the nib instead of the body (if i may call it that). The UV ink nib is being used to write things like \\"Doctor i'm waiting\\" and other things like that around the house on my doors and the sound it makes when I look at the writing just makes my day. Whenever I write with it I just smile and you can always tell if another whovian is in the room.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My 7th grader wanted this book. He could not stop reading it until finished. Very interesting book. He can't wait for the new one.
B002DQUP6S|5.0|My son wanted this. It was used in a class he took he enjoyed the book so well he wanted one to add to his library.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A pebble thrown in a pool of water creates ripples; never just one, but countless of them. This is what this story is all about. An uncle's suggestion led to a father's decision, and there was no stopping what happened afterwards. The ripples were so vast it looked almost impossible to trace back to the central plop that the pebble created; but secrets are meant to be revealed, truths are meant to be uncovered. The story played out through many decades in at least five countries among a myriad of characters, and yet not once did I feel lost or confused while reading it. I feel for Abdullah and Pari, and I am glad that somehow there was redemption for them at the end, even if one can say that it was not too complete because of Abdullah's condition.<br /><br />Another masterpiece from Mr. Hosseini, and may I say that in this third novel, he put the notch for himself much higher that it should be an exciting wait for the next one.
B003TVMIDO|5.0|I was surprised upon opening it; it says thank you from Yoko, Julian and Sean.<br />The albums go in order from 'Plastic Ono Band' - (what elated me was a double disk album of 'Home Tapes' & 'Singles' -- it's worth the price for just that last double album alone)!<br />It is all remastered - BUT - not 'clean'.  Anyone who is a John Lennon fan knows that he did not care very much for what they call 'clean' music.<br />He had a unique style of rhythm and lead because he wanted his music to have the original sound of \\"rock 'n roll\\", that he grew up with.<br />He wrote, sang (his voice alone was an instrument) and played from his heart and soul.<br />He held nothing back - and that is what I think - made him the best writer of 'rock' music of all time.<br />A TRUE GENIUS!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|These guys are fantastic - the music is brilliant, the film clips are creative and interesting, and the quality is amazing.
B00466HM28|5.0|Great performance , my music get awesome with this device . works perfectly and sounds great , i get the product very fast
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|A twist on the match 3 genre. Rather than randomly matching 3 icons of your own choosing, the game instructs you to match a particular 3 icons, represented by an avatar running through a dungeon and facing different obstacles. For example, if you run into a treasure chest or locked door, you must match keys in order to proceed (or use an item. More on that later), or if you run into an enemy, you must match either swords or staves to kill the enemy and advance. You can, in between obstacles, match backpacks, which have a chance of giving you items. Items may include weapons, food, keys, etc. Each can be used in a pinch and have the same affect as matching 3 of the same family of icons (e.g., swords, staves, etc.). Among the icons are also resources, which are used to upgrade your attack, defense, magic, etc. After each run, you will return to a hub. Here, you can upgrade your stats with any resources you've collected during your previous runs. By upgrading, your character will hit harder and take less damage, allowing you to travel farther in each stage, thereby gettjng you closer and closer to the 10000000 mark. When i finished the game, I had purchased every possible upgrade.<br /><br />Took me about two days of a lot of playing to beat it. It isn't that long. As a free app, I felt like I struck gold. Would pay $.99 for it, but nothing more.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it on the big screen with my grand children, It's great to be able to watch it without any distractions !
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I like this game but it takes to long to load. The graphics are great and its cool how you find the animals.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Arrived on time ,with excellent packaging. One of the best movies of all time,It's great to own it on dvd so I can chjll out and watch it at my liesure
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Peter Weller voices Bruce Wayne/Batman in this movie.  At first I was skeptical that he could pull it off, but he does a great Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Movie was fun, but you have to watch part one first.  SPOILER ALERT:  Some die hard fans may not like the fact that Robin is portrayed as a young girl.  Other than that oddity the movie is great!
B00BB67UNW|5.0|This is a story about political corruption/personal choices in a big city. As in real life, no one is  completely pure. The individual twists and turns were not predictable, nor was the end. I don't want to spoil the movie by giving away more of the plot. Acting was almost uniformly good (Catherine Zeta Jones, as the mayor's wife, looked beautiful but was underwhelming in her role). Mark Walberg Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright,as the commissioner, and Alona Tal as Walberg's secretary were great. This is an absorbing story and it takes concentration to follow the curves in the plot. However,for me the movie was one of the most rewarding that I have seen this year.
B000B589JI|5.0|I've seen name branded products that do the exact same thing for much more money.  These make great gifts for smokers, campers or people who want one in their emergency go bags.  They use a little lighter fluid and work like small Zippos.  I used to keep one attached to my key ring, but have since removed it, only because I prefer a minimalistic approach to carrying keys.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I wish they would not make me say so much.  I enjoy playing this game.  I like the sync with Facebook.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|This movie's action will entertain the kids and the adults will love the humor. Fantastic voice cast. Lots of fun.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a good book for teenagers and young readers keep them into the story and it presents a perfect narration
1250012570|5.0|Perfect. It was not what I expected going in, but it was better than I could have thought. I was immediately  drawn in and I could not stop reading. I finished this in one day. I was about 30 pages in and I was already sad with the thought that it was going to eventually end. I recommend this to everyone!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would have rated this ten stars but I couldn't.  This is truly an amazing book and I would recommend it to anyone who is capable of reading it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read. It kept you wanting more from the very first page.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case looks great and is easy to grip. I love the way it looks. It also provides great protection for the phone.

B0097EWK3A|4.0|The graphics are terrific. The music is haunting. The storyline will keep you engaged. There are plenty of twists, turns, and surprises. Well done.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so great for children and it keeps them busy for at least an hour with the fun games they could buy with fake coins that they earn from playing
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This Blu ray disc is amazing...I like the story and the actors, especially Lynn Collins and Taylor Kitsch, but the pictures and views are really wonderful...they are so real and let you dream about our nearest red planet full of life. Quality of Blu ray is amazing even without 3D and special content are very good.<br />Let's go back to barsoom with John Carter 2...please.
B009B1UZ7C|4.0|I saw Jake Bugg on the Ellen Show and in that clip of Lightning Bolt I could not get over how much like the late Johnny Cash the sound was.  Upon seeing him on You Tube, it sounded very different but I still liked him.  After purchasing his first CD entitled Jake Bugg I found I liked him alot.  I like his sound, the speed of some of the songs and the lyrics.  I think the CD is aptly titled as it is an introduction to this artist.  I am hoping for more from Jake Bugg and that he doesn't go away any time soon.  I think it is really cool that Gator-Aide picked him up for the Lightening Bolt so with those royalties maybe he can take the time to give us some more!!
B00B3YLI8U|1.0|Purchased this book as a test and was charged for it, but the book never downloaded, so I really cannot rate it.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|The movie has morphed Kirk and Spock into the type of super heroes that one would find in Marvel Comic books.  The only relationship between this movie and the original great TV series is the name of the characters.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|great old school shooter,great graphics,great controls.........gorgeous game.<br />i'd pay for this one........must get........beautiful fire edition<br />and today the price is right!!
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The world he is building is interesting.  The story stayed focus on a few characters, jumping among them at a good pace, building suspense that kept me reading.  The climax of the story had me reading when I should have been doing other things.  The author wraps up the story quite nicely without feeling like he just ended the book so that purchasing the next book is required for a satisfactory experience of this book.<br /><br />The con is that The Way of Kings is way too long.  This story should have been told in hundreds of pages less.  I can't help feeling that with it being a planned 10 volume series that book one contains quite a bit of padding, especially the Kaladin plot line.  The interludes seemed thrown in as well.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend it highly, but I'm hoping that the author tightens up the prose in the rest of the series.
B0093FNZT6|1.0|Seems very 'new age'. Author seems like someone caught between humanistic and mainstream scientific belief systems.<br />Not worth even this one star.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is an amazing writer.  Her books are hard to put down.  Each book just keeps getting better and better.  This is my third book  in  the series and now I look forward to starting the next one.  I highly recommend the Voyager.
0785168109|4.0|the book is very heavy, and lots of interesting concept arts that wasn't used.<br />however the paper quality isnt that great( compared to the avengers art book) seems like it's &#34;thiner&#34; than usual concept art books.<br />Some images are also in Low Res format which is kinda pixelated, don't know how that got past edit.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Wow. Can I saw wow? At first I thought this game would be dorky (especially judging this game from the front cover) and boring but oh my goodness. Indescribable.  It's amazing how a game can make you think tactically about every move. Thumbs up A plus for this game.
1933492279|4.0|the book was just packed with the standard cardboard wrap without plastic wrap, which is odd.<br />overall is quite good.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|I saw it in the theatres.  I watched it again because I've been watching Tron:Uprising.  I hope the continue with Season 2.  It's good stuff.  It has echoes of Avatar:The Last Airbender.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Simple format and style but upgrades and difficulty keep game interesting.. I recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun way to spend your time!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|More than the average run of the mill matching game. It provides hours of entertainment. The puzzles at each level are progressively challenging.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is awesome!! All the controls are the same and you get to ride in mine carts and swing/ride down a rope. Plus the game is free so really that's a two in one deal!!!! You HAVE to get temple run 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This has to be my fave game! Just every time I click on it now, it goes straight back to the menu! Please Update!
0061950726|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time. Also its history and facts, so detailed . True story kept me intrigued til the end
B00AKGG5VC|2.0|I was somewhat disappointed by this title. Of course it's got the MFSL manufacturing quality, but I don't prefer how they mastered it. It's EQed WAY bright. As soon as you drop the stylus, you can hear the tape hiss screaming at you, and everything sound like it's got the 6 KHz jacked. Not significantly better than the Sounds Of The South pressing. If you don't already have this on vinyl, then it's worth looking at, but if you're considering it, and you've got a friend with one of these, listen to theirs before buying. You might change your mind. If it were a regular pressing, I'd probably give it 3 or 4 stars, but compared to Mobile Fidelity's potential, I'd have to give it 2.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is my first automatic watch and it's very nice. I like it over my more dressy battery operated one. I hope to see its long reliability and robustness that I've read about on blogs. The see through back is quite impressive.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I would get this game. It is kind of hard though. When you get fast you fall over. Fun game though.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It is easy to use for reading which is all I do and is excellent for that purpose. I cannot comment on other functions.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I think the title says it all. AWESOME! I love this game because you can actually decide how it works! very cool and fun. a must have game
1582701709|5.0|This book should be an easy access Bible for everyone. It teaches you how to be happy and how to never give up. Gives you a new perspective on life!
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I don't like this version of Friends because they want me to connect up with Facebook .  For this reason I will not give it a good rating.  I am only doing games to pass the time not to connect with everyone in the world.
0143038095|4.0|We got this book for our daughter and she found it quite interesting. She even recommended it to me. So it is a Yay.
B00028HBKC|5.0|What a joy and delight to see the bible come to life.  I would highly recommend this to all as it is a blessing.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|A very good HO game with nice graphics , an interesting story to move the action along and it is not to morbid.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|In \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" when the crew of the Enterprise is hunting Khan in the nebula Spock tells Kirk that Khan shows a lack of three dimensional thinking. This is the same  shortcoming of \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness.\\"<br /><br />I had trepidations going to see \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" because I didn't like 2009's J.J. Abrams reboot of  Star Trek, but as I watched the first few minutes of the movie the hope of redemption crawled into my mind. That hope was soon dashed when I realized \\"Into Darkness\\" was a hatcheted up \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" with key characters taken directly from that movie, such as Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), along with key scenes taken directly from the movie and added to \\"Into Darkness\\" except that Abrams inverts the characters that were originally in the scene.<br /><br />\\"Into Darkness\\" takes the same liberties as before and violates the parameters of the characters. Spock and Uhura are `dating' and their boyfriend-girlfriend arguments intrude like a break-up between two seventh graders that at times seemed it would be more appropriate in a movie about Star Fleet Academy the high school years. In the original Star Trek, Captain James Kirk is a man of action but displays a much more intelligent character than Chris Pine's Kirk, though it is no fault of Pine's, he's just following the script and the direction of J.J. Abrams who seems to be trying to make these movies too much his material and not that of Star Trek or Gene Roddenbury.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is topical. A terrorist, John Harrison, bombs a Star Fleet archive and tries to assassinate high ranking members of Star Fleet then flees to the Klingon home world of Kronos. The politics in the movie is handled more adeptly then the ham-handed way it is \\"The Undiscovered Country.\\"<br /><br />There are plot inconsistencies that start to add up and become more and more of a detracting factor as the movie progresses, such as how can a person transport from Earth across the whole galaxy to the Klingon home world, but Spock can't be transported out of an active volcano with the Enterprise in much closer proximity? Or, if you can't beam a person or two aboard the Enterprise because you can't get a transporter lock on the person(s), how is it possible to beam someone right next to them?<br /><br />The cast is fine. Pine plays Kirk with less William Shatner's hamminess, Zachary Quinto is also makes a good Spock, Zoe Saldana is as hot as Nichelle Nichols was as Uhura and is given much more than Nichols ever was, Karl Urban nails McCoy and acts and looks enough like Deforrest Kelley that we believe his McCoy could age into Kelley's McCoy, and Anton Yelchin crosses over into caricature as a near hysterical Chekov.<br /><br />In an alternate universe if you went to see a science fiction movie titled \\"Into Darkness\\" directed by J.J. Abrams without any appellation like Star Trek on it, it would probably be an OK movie although it doesn't display the imagination needed for a stand alone movie. The whole alternate reality time line of Star Trek could be used to more imaginative effect, such as it could be used to show how the world of Star Trek turned into the world shown in the Star Trek episode \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" which shows a Star Fleet Empire instead of a federation, but \\"Into Darkness\\" has already passed that possibility by. \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" needs the imprimatur of Star Trek on it to justify the budget for the movie and to bring in the crowds to make it successful. Based on J.J. Abrams either fiddling too much with the Star Trek mythology or not understanding it, it shouldn't be called Star Trek.e Klingon home world, but Spock can't be transported out of an active volcano with the Enterprise in much closer proximity?

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Need to give credit to these guys. Great concept for a game.  Unusual combination of a puzzle and RPG game.  Fun and addictive.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought this book was pretty entertaining. I really don't like reading much at all, but I read this book cover to cover in one day. Greg thinks of the best things to write down, and its interesting to find out what can go through a boys mind these days. My middle school has never had any date dances before, but my high school might, so even though I'm only going to soon be a seventh grader, this is a good book when trying to find good relationship strategies for later on.
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|Simply outstanding!  Neil does an outstanding job at making difficult things more simple to understand.  He clearly focuses on technique rather than numbers and settings.  I highly recommend you check out his Tangents blog site for more similar and great information.

B001GJ3BPU|4.0|i liked seeing Affleck and wife Jennifer working together--fun do good super-hero flick. seven more words needed huh? great fun.
B0002E5O9G|4.0|I saw and loved the film...but, wanted to avoid Russell Crowe singing in my house.  I read a hundred online reviews and listened to samples and settled on this one.  I used to love taped live performances, but now I find the clapping annoying...other than that, I'm really enjoying this set.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|the dvd plays and that's all that matters. I haven't explored all the extras but they are usually really good.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Have  not played a game like this since Myst and absolutely loved it. I can't wait to explore new &quot;rooms&quot;!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Good movie. Can't wait for the next one. If you haven't got it, buy it and add it to your collection.
B00280LYIM|4.0|This was a wonderful 4th book in the Percy Jackson series, and I hope the next one is just as well-written. The main idea is that Kronos'/Luke's Army is storming the Labyrinth, and looking for Adrienes String, when they have which will lead them to an Labyrinth  entrance into Camp Half Blood. When the Camp hears of this plot, they send Annabeth on her 1st quest that she leads. For her questates, she chooses Percy, Grover, and Tyson. Little did she know there would be another unofficial member of her quest.... a mortal! Buy this amazing book and find out who is this mortal and whether Kronos will revive!!!!
B006M4F67A|1.0|The designs used in this game make it difficult to see and choose the tiles on the side. The tiles are extremely small and difficult to see, unlike other games you cannot adjust their size. There are no directions and some tile matches you discover by trial and error.  The game does not show you how many matches are available at any one time as does the better Mah Jongg games. As an avid Mahjongg game player this is the worst one I have ever played. I highly recommend Mahjong Solitaire by Agile Fusion and Mahjong Butterfly by Bandai Namco.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|My grandson loves playing on my Kindle and this game helps him develop strategy and it is fun to play.
B002JVWRAY|5.0|I really do like having the Blue ray and now I have DVD and Blue ray in my collection. Jensen and Jared do a great job presenting a their characters to all of us every week. I hope they continue for a long time to come.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|i have watched the other two series and this one did not fail either i am so hooked on it cannot wait for the next season
B001FB4W0M|5.0|I am so glad that I bought the blue ray Love Supernatural and The Boys. The Books and the dvd are awesome!!!
193700788X|1.0|Not remotely expected as a finale to the Sookie saga.  Very disappointing and not what Sookie would have done from any of her former actions and reactions.
B003AIEOCY|4.0|This is what i'm talking about. Pure Rolling Stones sound. Both disks are awesome, one of the best of the Rolling Stones.
B0031KC8OC|1.0|I was charged for the HD, but it has never streamed in HD for more than 20 seconds. The sound goes in and out and the streaming is jumpy. Terrible.
B005MYWZKM|5.0|Besides Florence, the quality of the disk rock it. It sounds very very good.<br />The voice of this woman is absolutely armonious.
B004G6009K|5.0|Tangled was a film I entered with a little trepidation. After seeing this one, I had regained my dwindling faith in Disney. It's lighthearted, funny, musical, and not stupid (or at least doesn't treat the audience like they're stupid). Everything a Disney film should be (except hand drawn)!
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I really love this Sade CD. She is extremely talented.<br /><br />One of my favorite artist of all time.<br /><br />I enjoy every song and play it over and over agian.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This somehow got overlooked by a lot of people. It's a world of romance and violence as seen through the eyes of a genX gamer. It's pretty killer.
0399250573|5.0|READ THIS BOOK. It is the perfect &#34;last book&#34; for a series that is this big. So gripping and action packed, I re-read parts like 4 times over because they were that good. I'm going to miss Alex Rider though!
B00797MB0O|1.0|Funny that this movie is all about being unfulfilled, because that is how I felt from beginning to end.  Painful, uncomfortable, boring.  Half of the movie involves taking shots (Makers Mark must have paid a hefty fee to be so glaringly featured).  The other half is shots of manicures and pedicures.<br /><br />Thought it would be a lighthearted comedy, was incredibly wrong.<br /><br />Oswalt does a great job in his role, but he did not carry the film.<br /><br />Awful.  Dont waste your time.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Love the cd if you liked the first two this is a logical progression for the band. I like to call it East Coast Beach Music.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|it worked well on one try. I reinstalled and got a red flag by trust go mobile security. I plan to seek another clock
B004SDEP38|1.0|I did not particularly like this app. Not at all user friendly. Chose to go with InkPad Notepad instead. much better
B00631VJIC|5.0|i absolutely love this cd! every single song on it is good. It really gives the whole vibe of the show.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|The title had me from the beginning, and I couldn't put the book down until it was done. Suspenseful, down to the last moment. Love how the author brought everything together in the end. If you are looking for a quick read, with a lot of suspense and action, then you are sure to love this book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was exactly what I was looking for. I love post apocalyptic fiction. Some of my favorites include 'Swan Song,' 'Alas Babylon' and 'Lucifer's Hammer.'<br /><br />Hugh Howley's series is now added to my list of must reads. 'Wool' was completely unpredictable and completely entertaining.<br /><br />I'm an Art Director for a video game company and this book filled my head with concepts for how the different levels of Silo 18 would look. I love it when books ignite my creative fires like that. 'Wool' is more than a story. It's an experience.
0887081770|3.0|When I purchased this item for my classroom, I didn't realize that this was a mini book. The content was good, but I would have rather had a normal sized book to read to my students.
1439153663|5.0|I enjoyed the authenticity of this story, the setting and the characters. I think there could have been a little more development of some of the characters, and rather hope a second novel with the same folks is in store.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I can't  believed I paid for this book. My daughter said it was good. It was long with lots of detail. That could have been said with fewer words. I have read books with 'sic' dialogs, but this book was truly disappointing. The ending could have ended better. Very disappointed. I don't think I will recommend this book or author.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was a very good read. I was disappointed with her last book, so I was happy that this one had a better storyline and just flowed better. I also liked the format change, as in the 'mysterious' bad guys and the different view points. If you like Sookie, I think you'll enjoy this book.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|One of the best First person shooter on any appstore.The console like graphics make you feel like your right their.
0439023521|5.0|I was hesitate to read this book at first until someone finally convinced me to read it. I wish I would have discovered the series much sooner! It is very rare for a book to keep my attention. I had many late nights reading this book because it was so difficult to put down.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great storyline. This is like my 4th or 5th time reading it! Love hamach I don't know how to spell his name.
1451648537|5.0|I am a big Steve Jobs and &#34;Apple Fan Boy&#34; and thought this biography was very well-written. There is so much about him that I never knew. It was great to learn how he got his inspirations and the type of personality he had. I will likely read this book more than once!
B009GED3HS|4.0|Thankfully, I have not waited the last eight years for the great unveiling, but rather was suckered into watching the show by my teenage son a couple years ago. Don't get me wrong; I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the characters and the storyline and now have been the one buying episodes and then telling my kid when they were ready on amazon. Overall, I give the series a five! Sometimes I still can't believe what they can say and allude to on primetime television. I imagine that's part of it's success and allure. I love that Neil Patrick Harris is so openly gay in real life and such a scandalous straight man whore in HIMYM. It's been a highly entertaining show, though this season has seemed a little \\"graspy,\\" a bit like a soap opera with predictable twists, fillers, time killers, etc. Thankfully, they were renewed for season nine, so they can tie up all of the loose ends and polish dull spots.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show does not disappoint! If Sheldon, Leonard and Penny don't make you laugh, you probably have no soul. I credit the show on making &#34;geeky sexy&#34;.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a beautifully written book that was profoundly moving on so many levels. Just having finished it I plan to sit with it for a month or so, then read it again .... I have no doubt that the second reading will be at least as moving.
0545265355|5.0|I was hesitate to read the any book from this series until someone finally convinced me to read it. I bought the first book as a paperback and immediately regretted doing that. I had many late nights reading the books in this series because they are so difficult to put down.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|This was a worthy attempt at making a GTA type of game. Unfortunately, the controls are quirky. I completed about 15 minutes of the game getting by with these controls but that came to an end. I can't complete the Dusk of the dead mission because the controls want to pop a wheelie when riding a motorcycle even when the Kindle Fire is in a neutral position. You also can't shoot and drive at the same time so killing and destroying moving targets is impossible. I also can't pass the Bunch of DICS mission because switching in and out of sniper mode is a hassle. The bottom line is that this is a game designed for a standard game pad and not touch and motion controls.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Interesting how you find yourself relating to the characters. All of them become a little part of you and are unforgettable.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is epic. The graphics are so realistic. I recommend this game for you, if love action and fighting. Every part of the game was amazing, but the ending was poor.
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|This is the second Galaga/Space Invaders FAOTD that Amazon has had lately; I much prefer the other one.  This one's pretty decent in its own right and has better graphics, but the controls are a bit tougher.  I find myself repeatedly hitting the Home key and needing to restart the app.  Also, I accidentally hit the wrong button and had to start over from the beginning - couldn't get back to the level I was at... Aggravating!
B000SUKPKM|5.0|Most &#34;best of&#34; albums are filled with great music - this one is no exception! Any Goo Goo Dolls fan should own this.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love that you can zoom. It's a very pretty game and fun to play. I like that it  rewards you each time.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's a great game. I enjoy how the single play was done. Have not had a chance to play the multiplayer yet but I am sure it will be just as good.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Very easy to use and I love that I can be creative with sounds instead having to listen to a CD over and over. Love it!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Wow!! Im very impressed of this series!!!. It wake me up!!! Have it all!!, drama, action, true see of live... Love it.. A must See!!!
030726999X|5.0|I really loved these books and Lisbeth. I've been recommending and loaning them out, When I got the last book I waited a couple of months to read it because I wanted this particular story to continue.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I like using kik but kindle should have snapchat so people can take pics an send them to other people kik is good but I still say kindle needs a snapchat
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|As a fan from the start of this solo career, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed and I haven't gotten tired of it yet!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|great feel, great sound, although i wish they were a little bit louder bass wise everything else works out great!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read - well written and endlessly exciting.  There are so many twists and turns that I'm dizzy reading it!
1881273873|5.0|i love it was for my ex boyfriend who never could show affection to me and i hhope he enjoy reading
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I didn't know what to expect but since it was free I gave it a try and I am hooked. If you were an Asteroids fan then you will love this game. I also like that you can see other people's scores so you have a challenge to beat them. Great game.
B008476HBM|4.0|The reason I liked this book was because it was really sweet and it right me about more vocab words that I have never heard before. I love this book!
B0063GORYU|3.0|I like the game, but this version will not let me play MY game.  It moves things to places that I don't want them and insists on not letting me move them ack to where I think they are needed.  I bought both versions of SPIDER and they both have the same problem.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is one of the best games with a lot of different  challenges  for any age.  Different tiers to try and different scenery.  Good clean fun. And it's free.can't beat that.
B0064NTZQ2|2.0|I was watching the beginning of \\"Drive\\" on DVD and I was bored. \\"Drive\\" is very slow moving. I wondered what I was missing; the film had gotten rave reviews. I paused the DVD and read a few internet comments. One reviewer wrote, \\"Skip the first fifty minutes. It's boring. Fast forward to the end with all the interesting killings.\\"<br /><br />\\"Drive\\" is a nihilistic, sadistic, nasty little film. There are graphic scenes of one man stomping another man to death. The victim's skull is depicted as having the fragility of an eggshell; his brains have the squishy consistency of chocolate pudding. A man places a nail into the forehead of an intended victim and threatens to hammer the nail. A man makes to shake another man's hand and pulls the man forward and slashes his arm open. There are also more conventional stabbings and shootings. I'm used to images of gore; my facebook friends tend to post the latest stoning, decapitation, or bombing videos. What sickened me about \\"Drive\\" was realizing that Hollywood executives cooked up all this nihilistic sadism as a moneymaking form of entertainment.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling plays The Man with No Name. He drives getaway cars for violent criminals. He develops a crush on Irene (Carey Mulligan) his neighbor. Her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) has just gotten out of prison. Gosling offers to drive Standard in a heist. There are some Jewish gangsters, Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks.<br /><br />None of this is particularly believable or involving. I never forgot that most characters are actors. Oh, there's Albert Brooks, who usually plays a narcissistic whiner, who is now playing an atypical bad guy role. Oh, there's Ron Perlman, who was in Beauty and the Beast. Oh, there's Carey Mulligan, who just played Daisy in \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Oh, there's Bryan Cranston, from \\"Breaking Bad.\\"<br /><br />It's impossible to believe that Mulligan and Isaac are married, or that Mulligan belongs in this movie at all. She looks like a dewy buttercup; Isaac looks like he could play Satan with no makeup. Mulligan totally lacks that Gloria Grahame feel of a true film noir heroine - beautiful, shopworn, tragic.<br /><br />The film moves very slowly. There is virtually no dialogue between Gosling and Carey Mulligan. The viewer has no idea why this woman breaks into Gosling's heart. You have no idea who Gosling is. He comes across as being too stupid or too smart; too amoral or too ethical; he's just not believable. None of the characters are likeable. This film could have had any number of endings, with everybody dead or everybody alive or the lovers united or the lovers apart, the money in the bank or the money in the backseat of the car. I just did not care. The film seems to exist only to satisfy that sad, creepy demographic of fans who pay to see \\"interesting killings.\\"<br /><br />\\"Drive\\" gets more than one star for Gosling's performance. He is a brilliant actor who can do anything. I just wish he would not waste his gifts on drek like this.aac looks like he could play Satan with no makeup.

0451232852|4.0|This is the story of how WWI affected people of Germany, Russia, England, Wales, and the United States told through stories of individual families in those countries.  I liked that.  The book is probably 50% these stories and 50% WWI historical information--how the war came to begin, political issues among the involved countries, how the U.S. was brought in.  The historical information was interesting but often so boring.  As a slow reader, it took a long time to read the book, and I won't be reading any of the follow-ups (at least not now).  I still give it 4 stars because I learned a lot about WWI even though it was painful reading.  Glad I read it, glad I'm done!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love this game so much. it's so awesome. my family loves it. all thought sometimes it's is gard butbit is still awesome
B008RTE08E|5.0|It is what it is, nothing can beat the Beatles--even this zany movie.  My wife has been a Beatles fanatic since 1964 so she loved it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|As I have used facebook, I am familiar with the layout.  This app is a good transition between the web format to the kindle.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|What can I say, it is a great movie.  I have been a Tolkien fan since 1971 and my respect for the (now) four movies honoring this series continues to grow.  This movie is must see for any Hobbit fan!!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The introduction was very helpful, but I haven't used it yet because it is for work.  This app will be helpful in the future.
B009NY43NY|2.0|SPOILER!<br /><br />As many others who have written a review I am disappointed in the final book.  I have to agree that it felt rushed and there was a feel of just trying to give everyone an ending...even minor characters who's stories were pretty much already done (and in one case never really developed to begin with) came back just to be written out.  This could of been so much better...I normally don't care much about the price of a book, but I feel I over paid for this one.
B008RJFRTK|4.0|This app is really useful for work as I am travelling all over my state. I wish that I could place a pin anywhere on the map though.
B008QTUA5W|4.0|I like this, so I gave it four stars. It did seem like a fair amount of gratuitous cursing. And I got to feeling kind of manipulated toward the end of the Season 1 series, I could kind of see through the facade of the creators trying to devise the plot to keep me hooked. I like the acting, but when the main characters (Nick and Carrie) were called on to go \\"over the top\\" in very stressful situations, it seemed to not work. But overall, it was entertaining and did make me think.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It is kinda difficult to get all of the suits that are in the game...I only got the first three and haven't played it much more.
B000FC130E|5.0|A clever fantastical reminder about the potential meaninglessness of life; a well written allegorical reminder of the importance of stopping to pay attention to \\"the little things\\" in life before they slip through the cracks forever...we cannot value what is truly meaningful and follow the safe, socially acceptable, and status-quo life.  They're at odds with each other.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|All in all this was a good season. Beckett and Castle together. However,  I felt like some of the electricity of the show had fizzled instead of sizzling like it did in the earlier seasons. It took a long time for them to get together and the anticipation that was always felt is gone. I think they need more suspense to bring back the sizzle.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Many people have been saying that this is not the Daft Punk they are used to - but they have made amazing twists with their music-<br />with it still having the touch of 70's, 80's and 90's. Still gives me goosebumps. Simply fantastic.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I loved the twists and turns of this season. It gave a fresh new spin to the old tales that i grew up hearing. It was fun to mix it up and see them in a new way:)
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this film save for the Daniel Day Lewis performance. Mr. Spielberg is of a mind that the primary mission of the Lincoln presidency was the freeing of the slaves. While a noble cause the resulting war killed over a million men. The most costly war in American history. What a price.
B00002R0MC|5.0|I love Bob Marley, so all hits go!! As others say, this is a good set for the beginner. Get it
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The vast expanse of landscape was inspiring, but I could get that fee from National Geographic. The Production Blog promised spectacular views of Riven-dale...I saw a new bridge and court yard at the end of the bridge... big whoop! The acting was superb, cinematography excellent, dialogue good, but not exceptional, Story line- not as good in character development as it should have been. I watched it twice. Will watch again...and add to my collection... but it should have been better.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|It has a very nice interface when editing word documents. I like the interface of this better than docs to go, however I hardly ever use it because it somehow interferes with the spell checker. After I send the word files to my computer and run the spell check, it says spell check complete without flagging any of the typos in the doc. I told word to reset the spell check and that didn't do any good. This doesn't happen with files from docs to go.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Just got back from seeing this, and I gotta say this movie could compete with some of the greatest movies ever made. Im not spoiling it cause you need to see it to comprehend how EPIC (no pun intended lol ) this movie truly is. To any person that appreciates a movie with a great story with the most eyecatching action and twists, as the song goes \\"this moment. We own it!\\"
1936719010|5.0|Read it - loved it. Read it again - really loved it the second time around because it helps you to better understand if the things you're doing are working or not and why!  It's like you feel you're being held accountable - and if you really want to succeed, then that's a good thing!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this game! it just wastes my battery because i'm on it all night. if you decide to get it, make sure you minimize your time on it.
6305428042|5.0|This one's a classic,...especially for the older kiddos (above 7 or 8). I imagine it would be a bit scary for the youner ones - but who knows these days! The acting is fantastic and it's a classic for your Halloween video library!
B00005JGAF|5.0|This is one of my favorite Ramones records. They completely nailed the 50s rock n' roll sound with their new &#34;punk&#34; style. Classic
6305291446|5.0|If you're not into the Halloween series - then this isn't for you. But if you are and if Halloween (the original) is one of your all time Fav Halloween movies -then add this one to your collection.
B00BDSRFG0|4.0|This record is way better than the last one &#34;return to zero&#34;. I was afraid that the beggars were losing their mojo but this record has a clearer direction and it feels fresh and heavy.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|What's not to love - it's Jesse Cook!  His Flamenco Rumba style just makes you move in your seat!  His musical skills are beyond belief and the sounds of the album really make you smile!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have read almost 100 books this year and this is BY FAR my number 1. It was hilarious, sad, happy, and most of all from the male POV. Its hard to find a full novel much less a decent male POV. Chase nailed it. Drew was like most of my guy friends. Hot, witty, fun and very much a douche. It was seriously like hearing my best friend tell me a story. And Kate was not your typical leading lady. She was a real deal. I never wanted to say she was an idiot or that anything she did or said, no female would do. It was well written and if there were any editing mistakes I did not notice. It was that good. Can not wait to read another by Chase.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|My all time favorite Horror Flick - it's a classic and I watch it every Halloween. It would not be Halloween with out this movie!
0143038419|2.0|It's alright- I love love loved the movie but could not seem to get through this book- It's slow and just drags on and on. After purchasing and reading I learned from a few of my friends that they felt the same way about this book as I do- Skip the book, just watch the movie and thats advice that i've NEVER given before!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This documentary EDUCATES about our Food system! I think it should be madatory to show in schools, I sure do!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Was nice to get the product in the mail on time and it also works great and is my sons favorite game.<br /><br />Thanks so much!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Probably the best book I've ever read, though not my favorite. It's a bit dark for that. It won the Hugo and Nebula (SF), the Bram Stoker (Horror) and the Locus (Fantasy) awards in 2002. Gaiman co-wrote my favorite book &#34;Good Omens&#34; btw.
1616550414|5.0|I love this book. I collect art books for video games and fantasy series, and this tome more than earns its place on my shelf. It's sturdy, the art is beautiful, and the accompanying text is informative and interesting. A must for any Zelda fan who wants an immortalized collection of the art that went into making the games they love.
0981951244|5.0|I have read The Compound Effect twice and each time I learn things that I somehow missed the first time.

0060763280|5.0|I just finished reading secrets of the Millioniare Mind last night and it really open my eyes to what is possible if your mindset is right.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I am always playing this fun app. My kids love it. It keeps them buisy and you can learn things that you never knew. I love this app!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Great value added product at a reasonable price<br />It is a must have for families who have more that 2 items to charge<br />Wish I had bought a couple more for gifts
B0098G7AWS|1.0|A few of the problems with this film<br />Hand on glass scene. I don't have to say anything else.<br />He was just drawing her hands. They just happened to be near her boobs.<br />She is in the water in the boat for awhile,then in the ocean, and somehow she survives.  This is while everybody else that has been in the water less time dies.<br />The researchers spend years looking for the gem and she just throws it off the ship.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|cut the rope time travel is the most awesome game ever. its supper fun because I'm this version of cut the rope, you have to feed two om noms. the cute part is is that one of the om nome is dressed up as a figure from the past. with all new levels, this game is ono of the most awesome games I have ever played.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I thoroughly LOVED this book. i had read reviews stating it was pornography, but when i read it i did not come to that conclusion at all. it was a love story, with extremely explicit sex but written well and not at all offensive.
B009D8RJR2|4.0|Michael Connelly's, \\"The Fifth Witness\\", stars the topnotch Los Angeles defense lawyer, Mickey Haller. Haller has a small but clever and dedicated legal team that sticks by him in spite of little money coming into the firm. As the plot unfolds Haller takes on the job of defense for a high profile L.A. murder trial that has the potential to make him either famous or infamous depending on the outcome. He skillfully applies his investigative knowhow and directs his strong persuasive talents against a smart and dogged female prosecutor who has tremendous resources at her disposal. The outcome of the trial is touch and go to the very end. The lengthy court proceedings are anything but boring even to an anti-lawyer person such as myself. The author is able to explain the logic and end-game strategy of every legal protocol and decision in easily understood terms that allows non-lawyers to grasp. Connelly's use of legal protocols and his sly application of legal innuendo manifest his thorough research for this story. Mickey Haller is sensitive, brilliant and legally intuitive throughout. I learned more about court protocols in this Connelly novel than in the previous dozen I've read. And finally, the author has figured out how to frame a proper surprise ending. I recommend this novel as a legal page-turner.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book, didn't see that coming. Can't wait to read the next last book.<br />I would recommend this series to anyone. Looking forward to the movies.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great style, plot and story.  It kept me fully engaged for the whole ride to the finish.  I don't usually give 5 stars but I couldn't give 6 sooo...read this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really challenging.  Had to really think outside the box.  Know that I will play the next one.  Was stuck for a while but I did it
B00005V9HH|4.0|I heard from my son that this was a good DVD to buy so, I bought for my husband's birthday.  He hasn't watched it yet but sure he will like it.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|stupid stupid as long as it is hated no more words are needed stupid stupid stupid  should not have got it
B009MYARIK|2.0|Quite possibly the worst Kinsella book I have ever read. I usually like her crazy plots, but this one was just too much. it was ridiculous from beginning to end & I really came to dislike all of the characters. Maybe she better go back to Shopaholic...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is almost like the real deal. You have to groom train and feed your horse. The only thing is that its hard to earn diamonds.
B000050X31|4.0|I give this DVD four out of five stars because of the magnificent Kurt Moll,  He is worth waiting for.  The rest are merely adequate.  Hockney's sets are cute, but distracting.  I prefer Sir Colin Davis' version overall.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|the book was amazing! i totally love the series! susan collins is an amazing author and knows her stuff! i would read the series again thankyou mrs.collins for making books that are awesome
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I like it as it is very fast. I get 4.2Ghz 100% of the time and I also use a program that stops windows from parking the cores.
1427200246|4.0|Learning during excercicing - after moving the content into MP3<br />Helped me to learn to adobt in any behaviour and habits of people I am coaching in my organisation
B008WOULPK|5.0|Read on a kindle now I need to check it out of the library for the pics at the end
B002HK9I04|1.0|-<br />Several years ago, I read that Charles Shultz's genius in creating \\"Peanuts\\" consisted of having small children talk like adults. The creators of \\"South Park\\" followed that lead and extended it by having their characters spew lots of Potty Talk. Funny for 5 minutes, but not enough to carry a full-length film.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is a great game. It reminds me of gta liberty city. Although it is not made by rockstar  it seems like they did make it. The only downfall to it is the game sometimes lags out it is worth 4.99 and 1.85 gb
0812993845|3.0|I have read all pf Sophie Kinsella's books. Especially loved the Shopaholic series, but this one falls short. People say they laugh out loud, really?? when, where?? Too silly, too contrived, not very imaginative. I give Sophie a C+ for this offering.
0938045695|3.0|Nothing written by Pavel Tsatsouline is a waste of time, but this book adds very little new information to his previous books about kettle bells, such as &#34;The Russian Kettlebell Challenge&#34;.  Any person who exercises regularly, and employs intelligence to do so, will have a firm grasp of Pavel's concepts, as laid out in his earlier books, and be able to apply them to the productive use of kettlebells.  It looks good, but also lacks the bouncy language of Pavel's earlier books, bouncy language which made them such entertainment to read.  At least read this book, then decide if it's worth your money to buy it.
B007SVPZMW|5.0|My 6 year old grandchild loves this game. It is one or two player, so it can  be played over and over. The animations are fun and the sound effects make it entertaining. I would recommend this game to others.
0143034901|5.0|Set in war torn, 1945 Barcelona, Spain, The Shadow of the Wind is an intriguing story about a young boy, Daniel, the son of an antiquarian book seller, and his fascination with the author of a book he encounters in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books - The Shadow of the Wind by Juli&agrave;n Carax.<br /><br />After reading Carax's novel, he becomes interested, almost obsessed, about finding out more about the author.  His need to know if fueled by the fact that he cannot find any  other works by Carax and the fact that a friend of his father's, also a book dealer, wants to pay him a great sum of money for his copy of The Shadow of the Wind.  He refuses to sell, and we are led on a journey of great emotion and beautiful prose as we try to untangle the web of secrets that surrounds this mysterious author,  Juli&agrave;n Carax.<br /><br />What gets me most about this book, is how amazingly beautiful the English translation is.  Originally written in Spanish, it's been a number one best seller in Spain and translated and sold in over 20 countries.  I'm sure it's just as spectacular in it's original language, but Lucia Graves, the translator of this novel, is to be commended for her brilliance.  This book flows with a kind of poetry that I rarely read in current day novels, and one I wish more authors would attempt.  Myself included.<br /><br />To read more visit: http://www.seekingbazinga.com/book-review-the-shadow-of-the-wind/
B0098VXBIA|4.0|As a labor and delivery nurse of almost 20 years experience, I was quite prepared to chuckle along with an amusing comedy about having babies, while I rolled my eyes at the inaccuracies perpetrated by yet another movie or TV show about childbirth. However, for a light-weight comedy, this movie does a remarkably good job of taking the extremes of what to expect when you are expecting to sometimes expected and sometimes unexpected conclusions, without getting too deep. All in all, a simple, fairly accurate, and funny (which childbirth and parenthood CAN be!) depiction of what to expect when you are expecting.<br /><br />The superfit go go go girl who has to slow down for pregnancy complications, the young girl and guy and the unplanned pregnancy, the couple who can't get pregnant so choose to adopt and the different, sometimes complicated emotions each goes through...not to mention the annoying woman who has NONE of the side effects of pregnancy others suffer from, and the easiest labor and delivery possible, but in the end finds out it's not all that easy.<br /><br />Not to mention the one with the birth plan that nothing goes according to plan. In childbirth, as in child rearing, it's good to know what you want, but understand that some flexibility is necessary, because you can't anticipate everything.<br /><br />They do a very good job of reflecting many different ways of becoming parents, and some of the hurdles the parents may come across before, during, and after childbirth.<br /><br />Good job.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I gave a 4 out of 5 only because it was hard to know where I should go next without using the hint button. But awesome for your money. Lots to do and great mind teaser!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|My favourite<br /><br />The best book ever I love the first movie can't wait for movie number two and three e
B0091REZMW|3.0|I do enjoy the game, but I feel you run out of energy much too quickly. I looked into the price of diamonds in order to be able to play for longer periods of time, but I don't feel paying $2 is worth playing for 15 more minutes. I don't mind paying a little money to play games, but what they ask is much too high, so I usually just play a for a little bit each day and then go on to play other games that I paid for that I can play longer.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was good. I really liked it. I said and done with the decision version of Niall Horan and the vampire diaries and the wolves started shaking even more than this.
B002GOAH1A|5.0|How does this have any bad reviews? I thought this was a silly, funny movie. I didn't expect it to be nominated for any awards, but I enjoyed watching it. Gotta love Will Smith.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie gives you a great perspective of what led up to killing Bin Laden.The other movie out there, Seal Team Six, gives you another perspective of the action in the killing. Zero Dark Thirty I feel was the best Bin Laden movie out there.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite books that I have ever read, my dad introduce me to the series when I was 12 and I loved it since then.
1594201927|5.0|very well informed and clear as well as unbiased in a era where kindness obfuscates the truth, he says things which could be uncomfortable for being the truth. He is accurate easy to follow and authoritative for he knows his stuff the British way
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It sounds authentic. I've recommended to many people.He has credentials that give him the authority to write it.<br />Moves smoothly.
0765325950|5.0|this is the best of the books, if only because it finally ended the series after all of these years
B003TVMIDO|5.0|The packaging, bonus material, and the sound of this set is great.  Now it an be bought a lot cheaper than when I purchased it.  Even if you have his previous box set this is a must for Lennon fans.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is smooth &amp; easy to run. Includes some advanced functions with a simple swipe. It is ad supported, which occasionally locks up my device (Kindle Fire HD) making it incapable of exiting without first visiting an ad. Smooth move but underhanded. Would give 5 stars if not for that inconvenience. If this is perhaps a program glitch, will change review to 5 stars. Since free, it gets a solid 4 for now.
B003ELKNOK|5.0|BonJovi is one of my favorite bands.  My kids think it's kind of 'old fashion' music but you have to admit that the band just gets better with age just like a fine wine.<br />Rock on forever BonJovi from a faithful and longtime fan.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|Boxed set in great condition.  The discs were all in great shape, and the box works great for storage. Fits my needs perfectly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a really entertaining and a whole bunch of people love it. When I first got the game I didn't think I would like it that much.
0743270754|5.0|this is a terrific book, so relevant to today's political climate of obstruction politics.  illustrates how this problem can be addressed
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use it all the time and is very easy to use.  It is quicker than instant weather on the tv.
034580404X|4.0|She enjoyed the 1st one and as the deeper she got into the second and third kinda lost interest  in them
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Wish it would last a little longer but very interesting to play. Can't seem to put the game down. Overall pretty fun.
159463176X|1.0|I was happily anticipating the new novel by Khaled Hosseni having thoroughly enjoyed his first two.<br />This was,  sorry to say - awful. Characters were disconnected and not flushed out at all. I found myself just wanting to finish it so I could read something else. If I could make a suggestion - save your money and wait until you can get it from the library if you feel you must read it.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|One of my favorite recordings of all times.  Great side men.  Varying styles and deep emotion from a classy woman.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|A fun addictive game.  The only reason i didn't give it a 5 is because you have to use coins to up grade your vehicle by earning them as you play or purchasing them.  But don't let that stop you, well worth it!!
B007HACDLK|2.0|Too much technical mumbo jumbo about weapons and ammo.  Not enough about characters and story line.  I bought it on Amazon's recommendation.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Viewing Silver Linings Playbook was a treat.  A feel good film that was also entertaining. Do yourself a favor and take a look.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|It is fun but I do not know how to get pearls. There aren't any instructions so I'm never quite sure if what i am doing is going to eventually get me anywhere!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Entertaining game. I don't care for the integration with social media or the constant prompting to rate the app but otherwise a fun game.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read.<br /><br />It's well written, well thought out and connects a lot of historical figures in a very comical way. There were a lot of lessons to take away from this book. One being the issue of war. Throughout Allan Karlssons entire life there has been war waging and he happened to be on all sides though he was the most neutral and unpolititical. He lived his life on a whim never really thinking about the future  and that took him to some amazing places and provided him with beneficial connections. Connections that got him out of some tricky situations. He did not let society determine his life, he didn't go to college get a job and collect his pension after he retired. He did things on his own time and it worked out well for him.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is an excellent game. It is one of the better ones in this genre.  I would recommend purchasing this game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game! I love it. Even if it a bit expensive it is Definitely worth it. It is fun and exciting.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|Terrible adaptation of the book. Its like they got the cliffnotes version of the book and wrote the screenplay based on that.
0425263908|2.0|She coudl do better by herself. I was very surprised to see how an author, who can clearly write, feels the need to copy E.L. James in a such brash and blatant way. The plot is the same. I wonder why Sylvia had to fall so down...
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Works perfectly! My boyfriend loves it (I bought it for his kindle) and it works exactly the same as the expensive ones!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This version of Hannibal is the best ! I did not think Anthony Hopkins version could be made even better.<br />But than again the new Hannibal is a Viking from Denmark (Mads M) and Hough Dancy is English and of course wonderful Anthony H is Welch. It would have been fun to see all three in this Hannibal...
B003WKOU0G|5.0|It shows us how humans conquer independence and beat little by little their day life on their first living year.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is a great story line and shows life in England nearing the end of the Nineteenth Century.  Changes are occurring in Lark Rise and Candleford as the story follows Laura Timmons into young adulthood and focuses on her family and extended family and communities she lives between.  Well acted and written this will appeal to anyone who loves period pieces.  Think Jane Austen.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|kick ass app and will keep  your kindle running longer and when the battery is low it will let you know what % certain app will
B0015DROBO|3.0|I can't really rate this book since I haven't read it yet. I saw the movie on television and decided to get the book so I could completely understand what happened.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great movie!  Saw it at the theatre and had to own it on Blu Ray! I bought one for me and one for mom for Mother's Day!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|What a wonderful read! David Baldacci has done a thorough research. He has a way of making his subjects and their situations come alive. My only complaint is that I am unable to stop reading! I can't wait to see what comes next.
0345529057|4.0|I bought the books for my boyfriend. He really likes them but he would have preferred them on tape so he could listen to them on his long commute but he really enjoys the books.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Well written and in your face story about a true American hero. Chris Kyle is an example to soldiers and people everywhere.
B00C061HZY|5.0|I picked up the LP and got the Autorip. What a great deal. It is different than the rest of their albums, but just as good as Discovery. Love it!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Great game. The controls take some getting used to, but it is well worth it.  Got it on sell for 99 cents worth every penny.
B009I5QU8O|4.0|I enjot EDM and Love SHM!!! The song's on here are well known and keep you dancing all night. It's a must have for EDM fan!
B008602KQI|4.0|This movies was very entertaining. It had an interesting story and good actors. I really liked it/ I also liked the fact that I was able to watch it for free on Amazon Prime.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Martin is undeniably a genius. The tale he is telling is gripping, the world he's invented is grim but exciting and fascinating. However, he seems to be a bit of a narrative packrat, and I feel he would benefit from a good editor who could help him sort the valuable from the not-so-valuable.
B003B02PF4|5.0|A page turner from start to finish. The italian kept me reading ahead, not speaking Italian.  Looking forward to the next novel. Surprise ending.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|It's a tragedy that Halberstam died just prior to the publication of this book, and maybe he had a better book in him, but I kind of doubt it:  this is truly magisterial in its description of battles and more importantly the men fighting them. No, it's not a complete account of the Korean War, but what it tells, it tells with great depth, nuance, and feeling. One of the greatest war books you'll ever read. A truly moving tribute to these forgotten warriors.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Good game that you can spend hours enjoying, if you are a fan of match three games. Good graphics. Hours of fun.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|A word of advice. If you like your films like you like your baby food, which is to say bland, predictable, chopped into little bits and then pureed so you can't possibly misunderstand a word of the mushy obviousness being spoonfed into your tiny little mind, then you are like the \\"people\\" who have downvoted this towering, immortal Andersonpiece to 2 1/2 stars, and this block of white-hot cinebrilliance is not for you. Go away. It's mine. I forbid you from watching it. Go and watch TRANSFORMERS XIV: ROBOCRACK OF EVIL or ERNEST GETS A COLONOSCOPY or BETTY DIAPER BOO BOO or something instead. Take your drooling, simpering, slack-jawed visage and point it toward some \\"movie\\" in which Adam Sandler whinges and minces and makes potty jokes. Not for you Joaquin Phoenix's best performance, ever, in which he burns a hole in every terrifying-to-behold frame. Not for you Philip Seymour Godhead nor Amy Adam's best performances, ever, nor Johnny Greenwood's coming-unhinged score. Not for you the best film of 2012. Get the hell out of my movie theater and let me watch the mind of the postwar world unraveling, by myself.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This movie was perfectly made. You will JUMP!  You will be very afraid. I will not spoil it for you, but I will say that I still have goosebumps and am shivering. I recommend that you watch this movie, but when alone in the dark. Nothing good ever happens when you are alone in the dark.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke really helps bring the story to the viewer. It is well made. My only complaint was too much darkness, but the darkness is critical to the psychological horror of the tale. So, endure it. You will be glad you did.<br /><br />I just finished nailing my attic trap door closed. Nothing should be able to creep down the drop ladder tonight as I lie sleeping.......I HOPE!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I rated &#34;To Be Loved&#34; 5 stars because I liked every song on it.  Michael brings a new freshness to some of the old familiar songs.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am so addicted to this game!  I can guarantee that once you start playing this game, you won't stop!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|this is an amazing album, all the songs are amazing, if you want good music, I recommend this album. Great
1612680011|5.0|Must read fir all people who care about their financial future. He puts complex financial matter in terms that I as a 20-something with little financial experience can understand. Really grateful I read this book now instead of later in my life.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|Its not his best album, ever since the carter 3 he hasnt been the same. Dont spend your money on this
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the format of this book.  Kept me wanting to read more. Enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I prefer the Percy Jackson  series, but have always enjoyed Ancient Egypt and the stories of their gods.<br /><br />Rick Giordano is a great historian and storyteller.
B002DJSBMA|2.0|This movie is looooooong and boring. I can't really figure out the point. Did I mention long, like 3 hours!!!
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|LIke all of Loreena Mckennitt's albums, this one is unique and must to add to the collection. I would recommend it to everyone, especially those who have not heard her music.
0345536886|4.0|Enjoyed this book, it was interesting enough to keep picking back up to finish. We read it for a book club and it had several topics in it that were good for discussion.
B006ZZAN60|5.0|LIke all of Loreena Mckennitt's albums, this one is unique unto itself and must to add to one's collection. I would highly recommend it to everyone, especially those who have not heard her music.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|While traveling with grandkids this kept them entertain, also learning the game myself. I recommend it for people who travel with their family
B002RV01Q8|5.0|I really enjoyed this album, as I do all of Enya's albums, it is precious. Her music is a must for any music library.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This is a great game for the kids. My grandchildren use my Kindle when they come to visit and they love to design different face and hair styles on this game. great for young kids. Good for their imagination.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya at the top of her form, I highly recommend this album to everyone, as well as all of her albums.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I've been playing this game for a couple of months. Bought everything that could be bought with coins and had saved over 4 million coins for future new items. Spent over 200 in real money to get bling to buy most of the bling items. Experienced some glitches, so I thought uninstalling then reinstalling would help as that has helped with other games I play. Once I reinstalled I diccovered that EVERYTHING!!!!!! I had is GONE! I contacted the company and sent emails...to no avail. I am very upset and am looking into seeing if I can at least get my 200 bucks back. I had this synced with my facebook, so there should have been no problem with my things being restored onto my kindle. I will NEVER download another app from gameloft again!! I implore you not to download this game, because if you do, eventually you will have so many glitches you will have to uninstall and then Gameloft will steal everything you took the time and effort to collect. I really hope this doesn't happen to someone else!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|perfect game. not too easy or too hard. challenges you no matter what your age. my granddaughter loves it and so do I.
B00A3SGWYC|2.0|its ok, i got it for 1.99 and if a paid more i would be bummed. theres may 3-4 songs i like the rest is mediocore at best.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book and I reccomend it!!! I can not wait until the movie comes out in november
1594204217|5.0|Michael Pollan can't do wrong in my book. I teach culinary arts and I thought I knew everything I needed to know about the history, culture and science of cooking.  But Pollan takes me another many steps forward.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This is a very simple game and it is great for little kids too. If you're like me and you are around little kids who love to play with your tablet or phone this is a great game for them. Zen mode lets them slice fruit without the worry of failing because of hitting bombs.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My daughter is a Directoner so I have been listening to this every single day since december, I am tired of it, but my daughter loves it and swears for it, so if you want to make your teen or pre-teen happy, go ahead and buy this for her.
B0087ITBPC|3.0|Was slow in lst half....2nd half a bitter better but not by much.<br />Not s sure why she wasted her incredible talent on this.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show keeps my interest because the actors are continuously changing either from dying or moving away. Unlike the long running series &#34;DALLAS&#34; , I think this show will draw more viewers the longer it plays and the ever changing complex stories.<br />It also helps to have as fewer zombie bites as much as possible and very very short 10 second or less  sex scenes .
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|I hate Hill Climb Racing because I always die, and the controls wont even work correctly. And that's why I hate this game.
193700788X|5.0|I thought this was the perfect way to close the series and loved the ending!  I'm so grateful for so many years of entertainment.  This final book did not disappoint.  And for the folks who were upset with the ending - or with whom Sookie ended up romantically - if you didn't see it coming, you hadn't been paying attention all along.<br /><br />Wonderful book!
B000000OAN|5.0|This is probably Queen's best album. This is the one that has the ever popular &#34;Bohemian Rhapsody&#34; as well as the hit single &#34;You're My Best Friend.&#34;  As with most Queen albums, there is a strange mix of styles and moods, but somehow they manage to make it all work together.  Other highlights include Roger Taylor's &#34;I'm in Love With My Car,&#34; &#34; '39,&#34; &#34;Love of My Life.&#34; as well as their live show closer&#34;God Save the Queen.&#34;<br />My only problem with the CD in the 1991 re-master is the addition of those annoying &#34;bonus&#34; tracks that screw up the original flow of the album.  In a more recent (2011) re-issue this problem was corrected.  The newer issue has the original album as it was intended and the &#34;bonus&#34; material is on a separate disc. Something to keep in mind when shopping for any of the Queen re-masters.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This was beyond a doubt one of the best epic stories I have ever read. The plotline and the character development is exceptional. The world view makes me a bit jealous in it's completeness and the overall pace made it flow smoothly through all the 1000+ pages. I highly recommend this story. Enjoy greatness at it's best.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Hysterical, original and romantic ... you will never stop laughing!  I loved Wallbanger and this is its partner!  I especially loved it being written from the male POV...It is a MUST read!!
193700788X|1.0|So I've read all the books. I watch the True Blood show (and I like it). I read the reviews before buying this book, and seeing how bad it's been rated, I went back and forth over reading this. I figured I'd finish out the series. Why not? I have some spare time. Well, this book sucks. There's no other way to put it. Dissapointing? You betcha. Boring? Yep. Random? Absolutely. I read an article in Entertainment Weekly magazine that they did with Harris. She had stated that it would have been \\"easier to kill off more characters\\" because it would have made writing the book a whole lot easier. I think she gave up. Honestly. Or hired a ghost writer. You don't keep the same themes and writing style for 12 books and in the 13th one just suddenly decide to change it up. I think she got tired of writing, has made her money, and just decided to crap out on this book. What a bummer. I'd like the hours of my life back that I spent reading this. I felt like it was random, didn't really make sense and was slow. Sorry this is such a discouraging review, but spend your hours reading something worth it.
1457514508|5.0|The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club (yes, it's a mouthful, LOL) was funny, intriguing, and a little dark at times and I loved it! If you're a fan of Desperate Housewives, I think you will find this a great read as well! It's set in a kind of a ritzy suburban neighborhood where everyone is talking about everyone and no secret stays hidden for long.<br /><br />From the very beginning, Duncan Whitehead's style of writing keeps you inches from all the untold truths and just when you are about to say \\"OMG, I didn't see that coming\\", he lets out a titillating piece of story and then your left thinking, \\"OMG, I didn't see THAT coming!\\" Whitehead had my emotions in the grips of is hands the whole time! I found myself sympathizing with certain characters (Tom), wanting to beat certain characters to a pulp (Kelly), wanting to call some of them out (Elliot), and wanting to hide under the table and peak through the curtains while the crap hit the fan!<br /><br />Literally the whole time I was reading The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club, I was filling my husband in on what just happened next (and he usually isn't a fan of reading...I know right?) and he was laughing right along with me at what came next!<br /><br />Shock, Shock, Shock! That is what you experience throughout this book!<br /><br />On top of all this, you have a killer picking off residents of this beautiful on the outside, dysfunctional on the inside neighborhood and let me just say.....your jaw will be left hanging and you'll be scratching your head when the final and most shocking twist comes in the end!<br /><br />I am definitely anticipating the sequel to The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club because while the book ended with a bang, I can't wait to see what happens next!<br /><br />I would highly suggest The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club to all of my book loving friends! You will have a hard time putting it down, NOT laughing out loud, and you most certainly will not be disappointed!<br /><br />For more great and honest book reviews, please visit my blog @ [...]r more great and honest book reviews, please visit my blog @ [...]
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I'm on my third run through he fifty waves. Still enjoyable. Love the &quot;daily challenges.&quot; Tough to get coins, but you feel more like you have earned them that way. Great strategy / defends style game.
B009AMANH4|5.0|great realistic historical flick. Good actors performing difficult roles. Film starts slow but gets more interesting as it goes into the roles of Congress bickering.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This series is an easy read, captivating and never dull.  Lee Child is a good writer!  I'm totally engaged with this character!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is awesome.  Totally worth getting.  The controls are easy to get used to and there's plenty of action to go around.
B0067R0APK|5.0|With 10 day, hourly, and more, this is the app for you. Look like a genius when you plan for the picnic
B005SCSL56|5.0|The story is packed with lots of adventure and excitement on every page. Alex and Conner are very desperate to  get back to their rental house. I just read it again. AWESOME!!!!!!!
B0035OC7OU|5.0|I think this is a fantastic book. I love the humor and the fact that it's easy to allow your imagination to 'see' the characters
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I started playing on my android and was trying to get it for kindle and it finally has its an amazing game
B0013FSL3E|5.0|it was a great dvd and it came when it said it would. i would give this dvd to everyone if i could.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|At Christmas-time we like to stuff our kids' stockings with little odds & ends including techie gadgets, movies, music CDs and such... Almost a decade ago now, when Sarah McLachlan first moved onto the charts, she was one of the singers whose songs moved to the top of our teen daughter's playlist... and she still is! We purchased this 'album' for our daughter and it was a big stocking-stuffer hit.<br /><br />Since then, access to the Amazon Music Cloud has been a gigantic bonus for us all! This set of songs, along with every other CD or MP3 download that we have purchased from Amazon since like 1999, has become available to be uploaded to the Cloud -- and we have taken full advantage of that opportunity. If not familiar with the music, checkout the samples that Amazon provides to help you make a decision.<br /><br />Now we can access this set of music and all the other music we have purchased from anywhere we have 'net access. Just outstanding!<br /><br />If you are a fan of this music, then we highly recommend this 'album' and the Amazon Music Cloud service to all. Excellent.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|this blu-ray sucks!! I have tried all of the sound fields on my new sony receiver and new polk audio surround speakers. I just get sound through the front speakers and none on the rear speakers plus no sound coming through the sub. When I purchased this I was planning on being immersed in the roaring sound of F-14s through all the speakers. What a disappointment!!! The speakers work great on music CDs and tv so I know it's the disc! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE-In order to get the full surround sound, the setting on the movie needs to be on 6.1 instead of 5.1. OOPS! Sorry for the bad review.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|If we had not paid to rent this, I fear I would have switched to something else about 1/2 an hour in. Yikes. Not nearly as exciting as the stage version. It is very long, and I appreciate that it was ALL sung, and I love Hugh Jackman, who doesn't?!  Everyone did a great job,  but its a very melodramatic tale, and after a while the sameness is wearing, despite the great scenery and costumes. Wish it had been otherwise as I was looking forward to it. On the other hand, Anna Karenina, totally under the radar, was fabulous, surprising in the other direction! I think both movies came out about the same time...
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I love this CD and this band. The tracks are awesome and inspiring to listen to as well as moving.
B009DKFSUA|2.0|The language is not fitting to allow everybody to listen to it. I did know I had to read explicit before buying such<br />a cd.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was a really good book. This book is about young love, life, and all the things that come with both love and life. I could not put this book down. It made me laugh and cry. At first, I thought this book was a hot for teacher book, but it was not. The author did an excellent job with dealing with death and the loss of loved ones. The last few books I have read, have dealt with cancer related issues which is close to my heart since I'm in remission for ovarian cancer. That might be why it made me cry. :) This is my second book from this author, and she does really well with writing about heavier issues.<br />This book was engaging, well edited, and well written. I will be reading book 2.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app. I play it all the time. The only thing I don't like are the advertisements. Other wise it's great!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I think that doing this game help your brain to keep his health.<br />I recommend this game to be use during stressful situations
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Book mark and return to the very spot you stopped. Daily Verse. And even a daily recommended routine available. Awesome!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game was challenging, fun, and very beautifully done.  My only complaint was that it was short.  I look forward to future room escapes!
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Been a long time since I have watched a movie that was great from beginning until the end.  Now having seen it, all I want is more.  Hopefully they will make a few more Reacher films.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Amazing that the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson in particular could produce more great music after all these years. I love this CD!!
044024630X|5.0|Great book as are most of those by lee child, I am a reacher fan I guess and it is an intriguing and thrilling book, Yes an avid reader here,  I  lke it and gives me another pass time adventure,
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Once again Kelly Clarkson has delivered another gem. She continues to amaze me. Love all the songs on this CD.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I enjoy all books by Stephen King.  I'd walk a mile to get any new ones.  Think I may have to do just that too.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I am enjoying hearing the Beach Boys live (with help from alot of their friends vocally). Would purchase a  DVD of their perfomance if available.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Beautiful graphics and enjoyable all ages game play. If you loved the movie you will have a lot of fun with this game. Build your very own coral reefs and get beautiful fish and other sea creatures to inhabit them along with the original characters like Dory, Nemo, and the rest of the gang! :-)  .
1932100660|1.0|This book is just an excuse for the author, who has a personal prejudice against animal products, especially meat, to push his agenda on people with the guise that it is scientific fact compiled from very comprehensive study and research.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great perspective on a small portion of a big war. He is a humble patriot in this autobiography. I loved the way he let his wife tell he side of the story along way.
0670026557|5.0|What differentiates \\"Give and Take\\" from other leadership, management, and development books is that it (1) shares inspiring stories and research with captivating messages that complement the concepts, (2) motivates readers to succeed in a significant and positive way through giving, and (3) equips the readers with informative and detailed tools and lessons to help the readers give in a both strategic and meaningful way.<br /><br />This book teaches us how to succeed--the right way. Adam Grant's work in this book is truly a profound motivator for change in how we view and approach success.<br /><br />I have absolutely no doubt that readers of various professions will greatly enjoy and benefit from reading this book!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good follow up to the first one. Very spicy and deeper character development. Can't wait to read the next one.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|Les Mis gets better and better! The 10th anniversary is even better than the initial show! I always get something different out of Les Mis.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It was alright. Nothing special. Not exactly predictable, but you knew what was going to happen in a lot of parts. It did have some unbelievable circumstances involved that another story line could have worked out just as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I &#34;listen&#34; to my daily reading on vacation!  Awesome Bible app ever.  I was able to make notes, bookmark and be reminded the exact verse where I  left off
B009NXV2RK|5.0|You have to read the whole series to appreciate the story line, the continuance of the family ties and their patriotism.
B001ENS0BI|4.0|I really liked the character development, and the cerebral nature of the series.  The last few episodes seemed to be written around a surprise that the series would not be picked up again.  They tied up all the loose ends, however it was clearly rushed.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I bought these for a new mom who wanted to make her little girl's room special.<br />They were exactly what she was looking for.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I had never played a game like this for the Kindle Fire but I'm so glad I did. It was visually appealing and challenging, interesting and the right amount of suspenseful. I'll be checking out the other games by this developer.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, but I can understand why some people hate it and others just admit they don't understand it, while not hating the movie for that fact.<br /><br />It's a beautiful, deep and emotional motion picture and I was enthralled in it from beginning to end. The way the six stories intertwine may make it hard for some to follow, but the way the information from each life time is presented is really necessary for the movie to have the impact it does for those who are touched by the film.<br /><br />It may help to go into the movie understanding that these are six lifetimes populated by souls who are linked together, for better or for worse and that the actions in one life can effect another. Some mistakes are repeated, some are overcome. Even knowing that, you may come away realizing that the movie may need multiple viewings to get the most out of it and some may decide it's not worth the effort, but may still enjoy it on a single viewing for what they are able to take from it.<br /><br />The consequences of our actions, our cruelties and our kindnesses can and do ripple outwards and impact our lives and the lives of others. Whether you believe we only have one life, or many, the lessons are just as useful. Life isn't about \\"me\\", it's about \\"us\\", but that doesn't remove any importance of the individual or negate the impact even one person can make on society when standing up against some injustice.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app I have ever had. It  is very interactive with the player .If you like Legos and building this is a very good app for you.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Awesome game espesially for free! It works well on my Kindle Fire and I like that it's connnected to Facebook.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love the app I just want a update when you could use potions on yourselves and use rays on yourself please.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|The multi-dimensional voice that evokes emotion that most people relate to, that is Madeleine. Her C.D. was the best birthday present I received this year.  There is a tempo for all tastes, but remember the title, as this is her &#34;blues&#34; c.d.  And do grab that cocktail and light some candles as you listen.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|Great game till this happened, I was level 16 went into a PvP match , had my level resetted to 1 with all my gear n points, now I can't even login cause it crashes on my kindle. What kind of nonsense is this.
B008220D5K|1.0|This is a vanity project for Judd Apatow to flaunt how hot his wife is and push his kids front and centre. They are not great actors and it must be said that they offer little to a very poor film. Whining selfish white folk moaning about how tough they have it is just repellant. In one scene Paul Rudd hides in the toilet to get away from his wife and family and I was tempted to do the same. I never want to see Leslie Manns breasts or butt again.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this app, it is very convenient. I think that they should have the %chance of rain though i think this is the only flaw with this app, but pI am very happy with my purchase, I would definitely recommend this
B00CVSMLXS|5.0|if uve enjoyed any of the previous shows / movies - youll most likely enjoy this througly --- nothing more needs to be said but amazon insest upon me adding more - less is more mr.amazon (sometimes)
B003O86FMW|3.0|Good book<br /><br />But I hate giving<br />Reviews what I like may not be what someone sidelined therefore I really hate this process
B004H1V5RU|4.0|My 9 year old son carries this within our vehicle as an alternative to watching the video monitor.  To my surprise, he plays with this often; I really thought he would quickly get bored with it.  I am giving it four stars rather than five because I believe it is too expensive for a light, plastic product.  My son does get a little discouraged due to it being difficult to accomplish.  He has yet to accomplish all levels; however,  I wanted it to be difficult because if he were to accomplish all the tasks with ease, he probably would give up on it permanently.
B00000K2W1|5.0|I love it Its my Dads favorate. My dad love's the song  Lord wont you buy me a Mercedes Benz
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Bang Bang shoot 'em up! This movie rocks. Give to the Govenater, can still be an action hero. Arnie gets the laughs and the bad guys get terminated.
B009NY43NY|3.0|So much has already been said; i can't add anything new. just wanted to give it 3-stars and say that i was not impressed with this one. For me DEA was average: not good, not bad.<br />I am a bit disappointed and don't even know what to say. ok, this will do.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Is pretty straight forward.  Things fall from the top or sides of the screen and you shoot them.  Upgrades come as you play and you maintain so long as you don't take damage.  Simple  gameplay, sharp graphics, fun music.  No ads, appropriate permissions.  A winner!
B00004Y3OU|1.0|I bought this DVD not having any idea that the Director destroyed his original, beautiful film. I owned the tape for a few decades but have switched over to DVD, so I bought this new, elongated version that COMPLETELY CHANGES THE MEANING if the original film. There should be a clear WARNING to anyone purchasing this melodrama that the original is not available.
B000O77QD8|5.0|The truth about the real raising of the flag at Iwogima.  This is the story that you don't see in the History books but is the true story of what really happened.  The truth first started coming out with the country song &#34;They call him Drunken Ira Hayes&#34;  A great song but many didn't know who what it was about.  If you are a histrory buff a true history buff Buy this movie
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|For all of you who grew up in the 80s in the computer culture, you will love this book! Simply awesome!
B0042MDAL8|5.0|A must for all those who have collected the series.  Those who liked the first release of the story and followed it through will love how it ends.  I would recommend this highley to anyone
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Running on my ROM replace Kindle.  Blast to play but for some reason a Google search pops up in the middle of the game if I swipe too close to the bottom of the screen.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I love this game!! It is so much fun to play!!! I highly recommend downloading this game!!! I promise that you won't regret it!!!!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Something not right about this.  Doesn't appear to support H.EVC H.265 SHV UHD 4K<br /><br />Strange voice changes to system notifications<br /><br />Crayon overlay user interface
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I love it because it was a great game  to play .it even got my anime characters. Buy it! You will love it.
B00AYF5SRG|5.0|This is first-rate Vivaldi playing, I think.  Among the massive slew of recordings of Vivaldi concertos a few stand out as having a fresh, informed and genuinely sincere approach and this is one of them.  There is a rawness and pulsating attack almost throughout the disc which gives it a real edge and meaning which is a world away from the Vivaldi-as-muzack stuff which has led many to dismiss him as a lightweight composer of Baroque Easy Listening.<br /><br />Playing on gut strings, the orchestra under Ottavio Dantone really attacks these pieces and even in some of the largo movements there is drive and often drama which lifts it well above the ordinary.  Carmignola is brilliant as soloist here, fully equal to the gutsy passages but also genuinely tender and affecting where appropriate.<br /><br />I'm generally rather suspicious of covers featuring \\"I'm a cool dude\\" pictures of the artists, but there is no need for dubiety here.  I think this is a genuinely outstanding performance and one which has become a favourite in my rather overcrowded collection of Vivaldi concerti.  It's a worthy companion to Carmignola's excellent Vivaldi double violin concerto disc with Viktoria Mullova [[ASIN:B0019RQTUS Vivaldi: Concertos for two Violins]] and to his very fine Haydn, too [[ASIN:B0062Z22DK Haydn: Violin Concertos]].  Very warmly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome book! Kept me on the edge of my seat. It was different from the first and second book but equally as exciting!
B00BF11STU|5.0|This is a long movie at 2:37, but didn't seem that long. Pace is exceedingly well done and plot is somewhat complex but not laborinthian. Acting is extremely well done.
B00CW665VI|5.0|One of the most brilliant read for me!!<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book from page 1. There's just never a dull moment and Drew?... I freakin' love Drew and his POV. He tell it like it is and i like that! And Kate is definitely his match! Love them both.<br /><br />I love! Love! Love! .. Tangled. Half way through the story i already feel like screaming to everybody to pick up this book. Yes!! Its THAT good. The author really know how to tell a story. Its hillarious and your cheek would definitely sore from all those grinning, smiling.. Laughing...and you also need tissue. Yes.. There will be tears but only from laughing too much!<br /><br />Its a story of a guy who's very sure of himself and got it all until he met his match and letting him know just what he doesnt have. His soul mate!<br /><br />I see a bright 5 stars from all the laughters. Yep!! 5!!..<br /><br />I love the author's writing style and the humour. Loved it!! Cant say that enough!<br />It made my favourite even before i finish the book.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a great match 3 game.  Very similar to Seven Wonders in its story--build a fantasy world one step at a time. Unlike Seven Wonders, the story of the Tree of Life is just plain stupid. Buy it for the matching game.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game me and my cousin play it all the time but I wish there<br />we're more characters.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This series has an interesting premise, excellent actors and a new and varied case each week that the lawyers are trying to win.  I am trying to watch all the seasons to catch up before fall 2013 new season so I will be up to speed on what has happened.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read.  Truly deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.  It was refreshing to read such a well written novel and yet have the content so upsetting.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this because it's just like grand theft auto but on the go! I've been waiting for something like this like a while!!<br />:
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The enjoyment for this book came as a surprise. I had just finished reading the Pulitzer Prize winning novel<br />, The Orphan Master's Sun ( which I also LOVED) and was looking for something different. I really didn't  expect to become so engrossed in this story. Well done!<br /><br />I'll be reading much more written by Hugh Howey.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|Don't do it unless it's free. Took me a half hour and it was done. Totally a waste of everything. I want my money back. The areas are dark and there is just random tapping all over the place you have to do to find things. HORRID
B00C0OOV5O|3.0|If I were to the writers, producers, and directors for Walking Dead I would definitely pay attention to those comments with 3 stars and not those with 4/5 stars rating. I'm the type who normally don't watch a lot of TV, especially TV series b/c I have no patience to follow them week-after-week and especially those TV commercials.<br />But I recently took a week off from work and ended up watching all three season of WD in a crash session; which itself is a small miracle. I love the first two seasons and couldn't agree more with some of those comments that the third season starts to remind me why I don't like watching TV series. If the story continue to drag on like this past season I think they are going to have serious trouble ahead.<br />Killing off key characters ironically is a necessity for WD due to the nature of its story; but if they are not replaced quickly by equally interesting characters and plots then fans sooner or later will lose its connection/interest to the series.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|And Winter came by Enya is new age music at its best. Enya is one of the most prolific entertainers of our time. You will enjoy hours of calm and soothing yet hauntingly soft music!
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Life of Pi was a bad movie because our family had to stop watching it when the animals were killed on the life boat. This film should be rated PG 13 because it is so sad. Most young viewers of this movie will be disturbed.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring by Enya is an exquisite rendition from the Queen of New Age. If you loved the movies, then you will certainly enjoy her!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|HORRID!!!!! I got this for my kindle F 1st gen and it crashed my devise about 5 times... it took about 3 tries to UNinstall from my kindle. very disappointed because of all the good reviews... I wanted to play. =(
0756407915|5.0|The second book in this series is just as good as the first. Rothfuss is the best writer I have read in a long time. The world is so immersive and magical and yet at the same time it seems like it could absolutely be real. I love the ancient folklore type elements.<br /><br />Absolute most read
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I loved this game but after a little bit it became old. Since its a free game<br />U should download it anyway. If u like it I would recommend temple run 2<br />In my opinion it has more variety and interesting elements. But all in all<br />it's a great game.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Well written, and Started off  interesting, but never reached a crescendo I guess I expected, then came out with a disappointing ending...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing! One review commented on the glitches<br />But I have not experienced any. I think it is much better than the first one.<br />The first was far too easy and dull after you earned everything. Also, the<br />Graphics have increased in quality tremendously. The only thing<br />I can comment on that is remotely negative, is that one part (the wooden plank thing) is pretty challenging. But that's what adds excitement. The wrapper up: this is a fantastic game--and it's free! Download it today! :)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is an excellent little app. There are no gimmicks, just a very informative and useful indication of battery life and how long it will cover for various activities such as reading, music or video. A major plus point in my eyes is that the advertising is unobtrusive.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|love the diferent culture world peoples and edge of the seat plots,cant wqit for the next book in the series and the next...keep them coming brandon sanderson
B0081BU42O|5.0|I have long been hooked on Ian M Banks &#34;Culture&#34; series. I am never disappointed and seem to be more satisfied with the completeness of the latest books. I found that I could not put it down once I started reading.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I can't say enough about the LifeProof case.  My husband and I both purchased one for our IPhones.  They have already paid for themselves.  My husband accidentally left his in his work shirt pocket while doing his laundry out of town.  He didn't realize the phone was in the washing machine until, or course, the load was done.  When he found his phone in the washing machine, he panicked!  BUT straight out of the washing machine, he turned it on and it worked!!!!  Fantastic case.  We've recommended them to alot of people.  Love this case!
0307346617|5.0|Max Brooks is a genius. I never thought I would read such an intelligent, thought provoking, emotional novel about ZOMBIES! Even if you aren't a fan of the zombie genre, I would recommend this book. It is just too bad the movie isn't going to be anything like the book.<br />The zombies are a metaphor for any apocalyptic scenario. This book is simply about &#34;what would we do&#34; in the event of a disaster.<br />The insight into human behavior and reaction is amazing. It is short and set up in segments where you can read a little and then put it away.<br />Hopefully they'll reboot this movie soon and do it right, because this book deserves a chance at the big screen.<br />Highly recommended.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's nice to have this version back. If the \\"Weather\\" Channel forced you to update the app with their new version that's slow, full of ads, and not even a little user friendly, do yourself a favor and delete it ASAP. Then download this one and pretend it never happened.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is it does cause a little too much battery drain.
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|i absolutely have always loved home alone 1 and 2 w/ mcculkin as the actor.  this is one movie to watch all year round and never get tired of.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This is a really fun game, I recommend it to girls. It is more like a girl game and not a boy game, I like it, it's fun.
B006RXQ2CY|3.0|it really wasnt what i expected it to be.  she really wasnt a heartless queen - but she just has her priorities out of order.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|this. game was a lot of fun.  hope to see more of them. I really enjoy ho games makes you use your brain.  I played this on my kindlefire and did nohave any problems.
B005H1SDQU|1.0|I loved his work with Genesis,,, I hate this. I listened to it all the way through and did not like one track. I guess I will just listen to trick of the tail  and be happy with that.
B0038P59A0|2.0|I was quite disappointed with this film. Too much fighting (unrealistic) and not enough time spent deciphering the cognitive mysteries of the story line.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|I have to listen to it more.  I'm not too sure about it.  I guess I like Bowie's older stuff better.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Truly wonderful movie, cast is outstanding, story is well done.  For me it is really a total pleasure to watch
B008BU75IQ|3.0|For the third book in the series - this book was a disappointment. The story and characters simply didn't pull me in as they did in the other books.  As for the ending - it will make me think twice about reading another Jeffrey Archer book. And, I've read ALL his books. This just did not live up to his usual standard
1439156816|5.0|Much has been written and said about this book; most of it positive. I agree. On Writing is part autobiography, part writing manual, and very fun to read. On Writing is insightful and inspiring, and most writers will gain some value from this book. There are several great takeaways, including:<br /><br />- write the first draft with the door closed (no distractions, no outside input, don't even share the story with anyone else), and the second draft with the door open (allow others to provide feedback, share the story, etc.).<br /><br />- the second draft should equal the first draft minus 10% (cut out anything that doesn't work or add value)<br /><br />- numerous examples on writing tighter narratives.<br /><br />This book won't make you a best seller (no guide can do that), but it can help you be a better writer. This is a small investment to make improvements in your writing.<br /><br />Recommended.

B0063M22QO|4.0|I play this game after work, and it really helps me unwind.  It's easy to use, and has great quality!
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|This game is so intriguing, but every time i pause, i can't get back to the game  All I get is a picture of the design from the game.  I would love to get it working right, but right now I'm sorry I spent my money on it.
B00C061I3K|2.0|Firstly let me say I love Daft Punk, I saw them on the alive tour and it was an incredible experience visually and audibly. Since then I have been keeping my ears out for any sign they were doing a new album. I watched all the collaborators series as they came out and listened to the stream on itunes as soon as I could. I was riding high on the hype train as it had been so long since I had heard anything new from them. But the more I listened to the album the more disappointed I became. I think the sun is setting on the Daft Punk I knew and loved as they begin experimenting with new styles.<br /><br />All that aside I can't help but feel I was given the bait and switch as the first sounds we heard from the duo was the robotic singing \\"get lucky\\" that harkened back to the discovery album with its catchy hooks and a groovy bass line with a hint of disco while still holding that very \\"Daft Punk\\" sound. This is where I feel I was set up to be disappointed, it felt like more of the same with some interesting collaborations to add some flavour and the album I got was another kettle of fish entirely.<br /><br />I won't lie and say I like this album just because it's Daft Punk, I just can't do that. Is it horrible? No but it doesn't feel as fresh and arresting as I thought it should be. It just seems like they are saying \\"Hey remember how cool it was when music was like this?\\" without bringing enough new polish to the tracks. The songs tend to meander with only a few stand out tracks such as \\"Giorgio by moroder\\", \\"Contact\\" and \\"get lucky\\". I wanted to like this so much but it just doesn't sit right with me.<br /><br />So to finish, I don't hate this album but it shouldn't get a free pass either, It's not incredible and I can't help but feel a bit cheated by some of the marketing but it is at least good to see they haven't just churned out another discovery. I won't be rushing to show it to my friends or even to get it out for a listen on a regular basis but I'll keep my eyes and ears peeled for their next album with cautious optimism.
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|Depressing.  Miserable.  Give me a break.  Ending sucks.  Blech.  Do not feel like being articulate about this book.  Wasted my time.

B0085A9J18|2.0|Actually this movie had a plot line pretty close to the end of the movie.  This movie was nothing but fight scenes.  While they were well done, they got tiresome after a while.  I know, I know.  This is a movie about a raid on a gangster infested apartment building.  So why wouldn't I expect fight scenes?  Answer.....I did.  But I like a little plot to go along with my fight scenes.
B00CPZ7DBW|1.0|This is the worst game I have ever seen in the app store. This game is a big goop of poop .
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I loved this movie.  It takes place during the Civil War era and Jamie is befriended by a white man and Jamie knows who he is.  Foxx's character goes through a transformation from being an abused slave to a gunslinger who can read and write. While Jamie is helping his new friend find the man he is searching for, Jamie is also trying to find the wife that he was separated from by an abusive owner.  Not only did Jamie portray Django with style and feeling, but this movie also shows the brutality of slavery during that time in our history.  I highly recommend this movie.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I was fairly familiar with the history behind King Henry VIII; this dramatization is really entertaining.  I am in the middle of season 3, and still enjoying it!
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in the series, but was disappointed with this one. The plot was forced and I wondered why I should care about several characters who were introduced suddenly, but turned out to be important. The story was like a runaway train, which made little sense. The ending didn't leave me wanting more, like in the preceding books. I finished the book, but don't expect to finish the series.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|really like this app. easy to use and free. would recommend this app to others looking for a clock and alarm app.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Nicely designed game with excellent graphics.  Good mix of challenging and thought provoking puzzles.  When stumped, clues are not spoilers that give away answers.  Very much like the original Myst games.  I recommend  this game and look forward to future installments.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I am glad i read this book.  a some points you just had a feeling what was going to happen next.  crazy girl

B00CW665VI|5.0|Well as you can tell I really love this freaking book.  I still can't believe a woman wrote it.  It was on point and was told from a guys honest pov.  This makes it unique and spot on.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game I love the game play and mystery it seems a bit short but I think that's because of how much I actually liked the game so in all well worth it
B008JFUTT0|4.0|This documentary was brilliant and sad at the same time. What a talent that went to waste in the USA, but I guess better later than never. Well worth watching!

B005EHNEDO|5.0|Another standard. Make sure you add this album to your collection. It's right up there with the best. How does one band get so many first tracks right?
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Loved this from start to finish and what an ending and what incredible stamina, great film. Its worth every minute.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|They don't do the science stuff as much which i miss, but still a great show.  Looking for the next season soon.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I found this book in the oddest way. It was on a list of \\"Great Fantasy Books You Should Read Despite Their Terrible Covers\\" or something silly like that. When I went to order it on my Kindle I was excited to see it had really good reviews and decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />I am happy to say this book exceeded my expectations in many ways. It is an action-filled adventure with great characters and awesome world building. The story is fast paced and left me wanting more when it ended, all without leaving a million cliffhangers. I think this novel is going to bring the author much well-deserved attention and will earn a place amongst the most beloved series in modern fantasy writing<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star was because of a lot of proofreading/copy editing errors that sometimes took me out of the immersion of the story. I would have taken off only a half star if that was an option because the story is just that good. I am not positive, but I believe this book was a self-published e-book prior to Penguin giving Anthony Ryan a publishing deal for the series. Hopefully this will allow him to make use of an experienced copy editor who will help perfect future book in the trilogy.<br /><br />Needless to say I am definitely looking forward to the next book in the series. I believe the author stated on his website that the second manuscript is complete and that Penguin is holding it for release until 2014. I really hope they reconsider because I can't wait to continue the story in the next novel.
B007549W62|3.0|\\"The Divide\\" is one of those films that could easily be a play.  It takes place exclusively in a bomb shelter where several survivors have fled after a nuclear blast. The apartment tenants have no idea what happened, and they are largely at the mercy of the superintendent, Mickey (Michael Beihn). The survivors all have relationships with each other - some are failed at relationships like Eva (Lauren German) and Sam (Ivan Gonzalez), others are broken families like half-brothers Bobby (Michael Eklund) and Adrien (Ashton Holmes).  What starts out as merely survival unravels in a post-apocalyptic tale where there are no good guys, only survivors.<br /><br />At first the team is united in survival and threatened only by their worst fears, but gradually that changes as the existential threat of outsiders becomes very real. Soldiers break into the room in biohazard suits and kidnap a child, representing the last hope of the survivors.  The survivors manage to fight them off and then even turn the tables for a little while; \\"The Divide\\" is notable in that many films of this type would leave the threat unseen off screen.  Here, \\"The Divide\\" shows you what's on the other side, and the knowledge only makes things that much worse.<br /><br />The soldiers decide to weld the survivors in, and then things go from bad to awful. The group splits into two, the divide of the title, each side claiming a woman. They barter for food, water, electricity, and sex, and the imbalance between the two groups gradually turns into a rift as it becomes clear who has the upper hand. It's not long before Eva realizes that there is no hope for her when she finally decides to take her fate into her own hands.<br /><br />There are no happy endings here; no heroes, no good guys - just bad guys, and worse guys, and they are always, always guys.  This is not a feel-good film.  It is a brooding insight into the awfulness of human nature at its worst. It's also a refreshingly zombie-free meditation on the horror of being alone with other people.horror of being alone with other people.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Pros: Cute graphics and sound effects. Could be improved, especially with the Pegasi wings and jumping.  Cons: Takes way too long to earn money for ponies and land. Some ponies (including some of the Mane 6) cost gems that take an insanely long time to get. The games are repetitive and cost money. Hasbro&trade; knows that adult fans of the show will be more likely to spend money than their younger counterparts. Support MLP:FiM in a way that doesn't promote more mind numbing cashshop games.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It seems like she tries to pack ten dramatic points into a book that can't contain so many. While sexy and erotic, the plot and the random mood swings of the characters leaves me exhausted for an entirely different reason.
B009LRE040|5.0|Awesome Movie<br />Never gets old<br />A fantastic way to sum up an epic trilogy<br />One can only hope there are more to come
B005K01VZS|3.0|It's a good story, but not up to some of his previous books.  Love the two principle characters! Everyone has someone like the old rabbi in his past, but we don't all take the time to go back and renew the relationship.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Personally I love minecraft and I want ed to play it on the go. Instead of carrying my computer I can just easily pull out my phone and play some minecraft. The multiplayer option is cool but to compare it with the pc... not so much.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|A friend tried the Gerson method, and ceased getting sick (he works in a hospital lab and usually came down with several diseases throughout the year).  So I got the book and find it fascinating.  I've moved to organic vegs, and grow my own, and am searching for a juicer.  Charlotte spends too much time criticizing opponents of her Dad, but you can skip over that.  Thus the book is far shorter than expected.  The fact that Gerson's have evidence that this method works against a variety of diseases, including cancer, makes it provocative, exciting, and worth reading/following.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Very detailed the description is very filling and it keeps you reading for hours can't wait to get into the next book I'm glad that there is a big set of this story. The twists in it are good and twisted. I have started to read this to my husband in the middle of this book and I had to feel him in on the first book of city of bones the books keep getting more and more fulfilling. I only hope the the movie that they have coming out on the instruments is as good with the detail as the books are. But<br /> they never can that's what makes my imagination go good with this book series and others.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Disappointing ending, not \\"gripping\\" as described.  I enjoyed the book, but it did not live up to the hype.<br />I
B007REW8DO|5.0|Okay, so when I first got this I was happy! It came a day earlier so I had it for a party I was holding that night. I am 12 years old and I usually am very picky with music but this is an awesome album with great music! It came in very good condition with so scratches or breaks. I've had it for about 4 months now and it is still working great! I recommend it for Fans of Christina's music! 😊😊
1576754227|5.0|I like that this book is quick n easy to read. I marked it up and will review it again, but even the first read through planted some good seeds. I have been recommending it to all my friends who tend to procrastinate, which is pretty much everyone. We're a lazy bunch, but we have good intentions.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Scrat and all the fabulous characters from the Ice Age movies are represented in the game.  There are great graphics!  There is lot to keep you occupied and hold your interest - creating different animal families, feeding them, collecting coins, and expanding your village. Watching short movie trailers earns acorns needed in the game.  The game allows you to play for an extended amount of time and through various goals and levels - very surprising for a free game!  This game is excellent and is highly recommended.  Enjoy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is AWESOME in every book he is in.  I wish I could be just him.  Two thumbs up.
034553056X|2.0|John Grisham has been one of my favorite authors ever since he first started writing. This book was a disappointment. Two of the &#34;litigators&#34; were definitely sleazy and the &#34;hero&#34; didn't seem all that heroic. Better luck next time.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a book I could not put down, and being a avid reader, it doesn't happen too often.  This is the first time I have felt inclined to leave a review. I absolutely recommend it. What a wonderful story filled with inspiring characters that truly pulls on your heartstrings.  Sad it's ended.
0316098329|5.0|I finished this book a week before the three girls were discovered imprisoned in Cleveland. It was like one of the girls had slipped out and written the book, then went back to be rescued. Read this book if you have any interest in what happened and what will probably happen to those girls.

B002HJ9PTO|3.0|nothing more. The sound quality is acceptable. the foam mic cover comes off too easy. there is no indicator that it is on or has a charged battery so it is easy to leave the battery on after use or forget to turn it on for use.

B00B04NJLW|2.0|Yea i'll admit it, it did sound like a damn good idea. However, they should do an American version of the film. The spoken language is not english and there is no setting for it. The films are like everyone says-some are good and some are just plain stupid. I'd rent it if your interested but don't make the mistake I did & buy it.

B007HLIUN4|2.0|As a student and practitioner of development theory there is nothing new in this book which hasn't been discussed before. The importance of institutions as a liaison between the state and the market has been a widely researched and hotly debated topic within academia for quite some time. The importance of this book is that it makes this concept accessible to a wider audience thus renewing the focus on political economy, a subject which has been sadly sidelined by the apolitical,  rational choice based simplistic and positivist approach of contemporary economics. Notwithstanding the good intentions, this is an ambitious book spanning broad swathes of histories and cultures, thus there is a very real pitfall of oversimplifying the complex processes that embody institutional change, which unfortunately the authors are not able to successfully avoid. Some of the broad issues I have with this book are as follows:<br /><br />1. The central thrust of the authors' arguments is towards distinguishing between 'extractive' (good) and 'inclusive' (bad) institutions. Now, the fist issue as perhaps apparent from the parentheses is that there is a strong normative element to what actually constitutes good and bad institutions. Good, or inclusive institutions are almost always referred to as those that promote economic growth. This can be a bit tautological since the authors themselves indicate in come passages that economic growth does not necessarily equate to 'development', which encompasses a broader gamut of indicators such as health, life expectancy, political equality - most of which are highly contested - for instance, there is still no academic consensus regarding the role that citizenship or civil society plays as a tool for achieving economic growth. Largely because the very definition of these terms is interpreted differently within different cultures, therefore suggesting that cultural values and norms cannot be delinked from political and economic institutions. Moreover, despite the authors' attempt to minimise the role of culture one cannot escape the fact that political processes leverage cultural idioms to justify institutions, both good and bad.<br /><br />2. Leading from 1. there is no clarification of the characteristics that comprise extractive and inclusive institutions. At some points in the text extractive institutions are conflated with corruption and in other contexts they are used in conjunction with authoritarian (i.e. less liberal) regimes<br /><br />My biggest issue is that the authors employ a very narrow, atomistic view of institutions. In other words, the nature of institutional evolution is largely described as a local phenomenon divorced from the operation of institutions with a big I, such as the world bank, imf etc and the colonial ones that preceded them, which were equally responsible and in most cases, instrumental, in determining the nature of political settlement and institutional development in Africa, Russia, Asia and Latin America. These big I institutions are still relevant when discussing political economy at the level of nation states. Glossing over these interlinkages for the sake of theoretical consistency makes the authors vulnerable to accusations of promoting a narrow, western centric view a la Niall Ferguson. One should not forget that some countries depended on extractive political and economic institutions thrust on other countries or social groups in order to maintain their own inclusive ones.
0440245915|5.0|Ford County, Mississippi, is the setting for a heinous crime: the rape and torture of a black 10-year-old girl named Tonya at the hands of two drunk white rednecks named Billy Ray Cobb and Pete Willard.  She is left for dead, but miraculously rescued and taken to the hospital.  The plot begins moving rapidly once the father of the girl, Carl Lee Hailey, gets an M-16 rifle from an old war buddy and takes his revenge on the rednecks on the day of their arraignment.<br />Hailey, confused by a judicial system that favors whites over blacks, asks small-town lawyer Jake Brigance to represent him.  Brigance isn't a fancy city lawyer; his disbarred drunk ex-partner Lucien and his surly secretary Ethel provide the only help he'll get when he goes up against NAACP lawyers hired by a shady preacher named Agee as well as county DA Buckley, who's got his eye on the Governor's mansion.  It's easy to sympathize with Carl Lee; his daughter's life has been changed irrevocably.  It's also easy to emphathize with Jake, whose life is turned upside down by this case, which puts him on television and in the sights of the local Klansmen, who try to kill him a couple of times.<br /><br />This book is terrific.  The small-town gossip and backroom deals and crooked politicians are to be expected.  The marrow-deep racism and the presence of the Klan are handled well; the vicious attacks that the Klan perpetrates on those involved with Hailey's defense puts them on par with the rapists as far as villains go.  The actual trial of Carl Lee Hailey doesn't get started until the book's climax and in between are some great monologues about racism, the Vietnam War, revenge, the legal system, and why people in the south have two names (Billy Ray, Bobby Joe, etc.).  There are also descriptions of jury sequestration, jury selection, and witness tampering, mostly in the form of dialogue between Brigance and an idealistic Boston-bred law clerk named Ellen Roark (or Row Ark, as Brigance calls her), who comes to help Jake win the case.<br /><br />This was John Grisham's first novel and he is a master storyteller.  The dialogue, particularly between Brigance and Roark, is crackling.  The aftermath of violent crime and how it affects other is handled well.  The book isn't an easy read, as it deals with child rape and racism, but Grisham is balanced in his writing; he doesn't favor whites or blacks, he simply reports how people in the deep south think, act, and feel.es to help Jake win the case.<br /><br />This was John Grisham's first novel and he is a master storyteller.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this book, the characters, the setting--all of it.  It reminded me of Gone with the Wind, The Help, Downton Abbey.  If you like any of those, then you will like this book.  I cannot say enough good things about it.  I hope there is a sequel because I didn't want to say goodbye to these characters.

076115678X|5.0|I have naturally curly hair and have searched for many years for the right products; some were made my hair stiff, some dryed it out, some didn't help with frizz, some made my hair flakey, some itchy...... this product is great! After carefully researching I found it reassuring to know that the lady, Lorraine Massey, who invented this line of products ACTUALLY HAS NATURALLY CURLY HAIR HERSELF!!! I purchased the deva curl gel, deva curl no poo, deva curl conditioner, and curly girl book - my experience with all of them together is fantastic! I am not kidding...ONE wash and gel using the method detailed for my hair in the book and it was a night and day difference!!! ONE wash and people I see every day were commenting on how great my hair looked literally overnight!! I only wish I could get to the Devachan salon to have a cut done by someone who actually knows how to cut curly hair!!<br /><br />Hats off to the Deva Girls from all of us curly girls!!! :)

I cry, I laugh and sometime I want to scream and throw the book across the room. Sue me. One of the women was a fan but was waiting to buy the book. I told her. \\"Don't waste your money. Check it out at the library!\\"<br /><br />Ms. Harris please tell me what were you thinking?!<br /><br />It's been Sookie and Eric's relationship since DTTW. Yes there have been bumps along the way. How could you throw that relationship away in a few pages?!!!! Their marriage ended and Sookie didn't even bat an eye. It was no big deal. Sorry not the Sookie I've come to know over the course of 12 books! She would've fought tooth and nail like she's always fought. I thought Pam and Eric had to have some secret plan. Maybe Eric would marry Oklahoma and stake the bitch but no. He's shackled to OK for 200 years and walks away with his tail between his legs.<br /><br />My husband is now shaking his head because I'm growling and gnashing my teeth while typing.<br /><br />If memory serves me correct you chose an ending to this series a long time ago, I believe after book 4 or 5 but I might be wrong. You tried to cram that ending into a storyline that has evolved drastically since that point and you wonder why your readers are enraged? GET A CLUE! You think because I didn't enjoy this book I'm an \\"entitled reader\\". I didn't enjoy this book because like several of the previous books in this series it consisted of character revision, plot holes I could drive a truck through and don't even get me talking about the absurd plot points (Hello a devil really?! Why not just go for the big bad and use The Devil and be done with it?!) I've read fanfiction that was better than this!<br /><br />Fine you wanted Sookie's HEA to be with Sam. If there was more of a buildup of their relationship I could understand it. If Sam went gradually from being her boss and friend to her lover I'd understand but the transition happened with a snap of the fingers. Sookie divorced Eric and she's suddenly shagging Sam?!?! I won't even begin to express my feelings on this subject.<br /><br />Goodbye Sookie. I'm sorry you were given such a poor send off. Rest in peace my friend. (Yes I am aware she's still alive at the end but seriously what's the point?)ine that has evolved drastically since that point and you wonder why your readers are enraged? GET A CLUE!

B004X75RK4|2.0|Sooooooooo predictable.  Cookie-cutter story line, totally Unbelievable  NO Chemistry. Glad it was only a 1.99 rental.  Would not recommend to anyone
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The music will live on forever.  Their performance is timeless.<br />What a movie to see over and over again as we grow old.
B00B00RJJO|4.0|This is a pleasant outing by a guy who usually plays a lot rougher. If you want &#34;soap box&#34; Billy, this won't be your cup of tea. However, if you appreciate a subtle,  well-aged song crafter meditating on the passage of time and ironies of life, you'll love every cut. Billy hasn't lost the passion of his street busking days, he's just wiser on this disc. It doesn't reach the heights of Mermaid Avenue, but it's a nice addition to the catalog.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is the second book that I have read by Gillian Flynn and she is truly a master at writing great psychological thrillers.<br /><br />The book begins with a couple of writers who have met, fallen in love and married. They worked for a time in New York but when both are let go from their jobs, they return to his home town in Missouri, supposedly to take care of his aging and ailing parents. He eventually opens up a bar in town with his sister, using money from his wife. It is now the day of their fifth anniversary and he gets a call from a neighbor that the door is open to the house. There are signs of a struggle and his wife is gone.<br /><br />What's happened and who has done what — its like a classic mystery but the twist comes in the two characters, who I both dislike but can't stop reading about. He lies, its obvious from the start, and she seems to be too good to be true. The surprises just keep happening — all the way to the end.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|I played this game on the ps2 and the ps3 was very nostalgic and fun. The graphics aren't state of the art, but it still stands up well. Best of all the game is fun to play. The only thing that irritated me is that sometimes the game feels like it is a maze as you are running around trying to accomplish things. A map would have helped me from making repeated wrong turns. I love the game and my kids love it too. It was great to beat it again. I still haven't played shadow of the colossus, but ico is awesome.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|This CD is great! I love most of it, and highly suggest it by anyone who loves Rock & Roll.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|It is different. This is book not the same King's way we are use to. The story is nice. (I cannot tell much so I can damage the story), but if you are follower of King's books, you will love this one. Don't miss it !!!

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have been waiting on this game for the Kindle Fire forever!!  I have this on my phone and my two kids iPods. Great game.
193700788X|1.0|I feel like I just read Breaking Dawn.  What is it with the last-book-in-the-series-failures?  Maybe I will decide to promise to never read the last book of a series I love again.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Cant go wrong with free to play games such as this. Well made, nice controls, graphics,sound, etc. Get it! I prefer paying one fee upfront but games like this do the buy in game stuff right and is still pretty fun without spending much or nothing.
