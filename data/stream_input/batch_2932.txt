B006LSZECO|4.0|The best part of Gone Girl is the way the author manipulates you by alternating between the husband's perspective and the wife's.  Each new chapter flips that perspective and you get new clues & twists that have you switching your empathy to the other, until eventually you're trying to decide who you despise the least.  It does start out a bit slow and by the end of Part One I almost set it aside and moved on.  I'm glad I didn't because once I started Part Two I could barely put it down. Somebody aptly described it as a \\"slow burn\\" that intensifies and constantly surprises. Yes there is foul language but it seems in keeping with the characters and how shallow they turn out to be.  The ending is not great but it's not horrible either. It's just subtle, not dramatic.  If you're looking for a feel-good ending this book may not be for you. I am really curious to see how they change it when the movie comes out! Overall I think it's definitely worth reading - many times in life the ride is more thrilling than the destination.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a smart show for people who like it interesting.  Lots of twists and turns.  Takes some license with the law, but what legal show doesn't?  Great acting seals the deal.  Just getting started on season two.  I need to catch up so I can watch this season!  Well worth your time.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Ordered with gift coins but looks like you're trying to charge it to my credit card.  What gives?  Please help.
0385528787|5.0|...though I wish it wasn't over.  Best series I've read in a looooong time.  Wonder what's next for Ms Atwood!
B005ETANC2|5.0|A classic from many moons ago, this was one of the better animals/insect movies of its era. Its highly recommended!
B005LAII80|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Very similar in tone to escape from new york.  This movie doesn't waste a single frame and is just long enough to make its point. Karl urban really embodies the dredd character.  Hope the make a sequel.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, but I am glad I gave it a try.  The premise for the show is extremely cool.  Mike Ross (pothead dropout) gets a chance in a Law firm when Harvey Specter, impressed with his genius intelligence and photographic memory gives him a shot.  The writers do a great job of balancing Ross' intelligence with his lack of experience, which makes him seem human and very prone to mistakes, albeit a genius.  The supporting cast of Louis Lit, Jessica Pearson, Donnah (harvey's secretary), Rachel, and Harold make this show a fun ride.<br /><br />Just try the pilot episode, and see if you enjoy it.
B00821OX98|5.0|I love this show! I have watched every episode from the beginning to the last show for the summer.  I hope they will be making more.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|It feels like i spend so much time searching for books that are this engrossing, page turning and gripping so that when I finally find one it is awesome.  I definitely recommend this book, but first read The Name of the Wind.  I am jealous for those of you who get to read it for the very first time, I never forget that feeling, with every book as great as this one.  Eagerly waiting the third installment!
B003R0LBVW|5.0|beautiful writing and compelling story of a contemporary family lineage.<br />It could be anyone's family.  I highly recommend this book.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I really enjoyed the first season and am happy to see the quality continued during the second.  This season has more of a story arc, encompassing the many episodes, whereas in the first season, each episode could be viewed separate from the other.  I can't decide which model I like better but regardless, a quality show.  I recommend watching season 1 first, and then this one.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Hey can't wait to get piston s in the game it will be awesome and Redstone stuff all that cool stuff
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Unable to keep up with the series when it was actually on.  Have had a lot of fun viewing it from Season 1.  Season 3 was as good as the first two seasons. They did a good job keeping up with all the characters.  Wonder how it will all end? :&#62;)
B0030U1TW0|5.0|Fast and great quality, nice work! Great addition to my GG collection. Keep up the great speedy exceptional quality work.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love everything Sherlock. I adore the original Conan Doyle stories and l love adaptations. This version of Sherlock is so fun to watch. We know he's brilliant, Watson knows he's brilliant, but he shows us that Watson's brilliant, too!
B005WYFLNU|5.0|My 7 year old and her friends love this. They spend hours putting together the book and making up their own stories.
B004UPANAI|3.0|I love the X-men and I love Hugh Jackman and I love Wolverine, so I should have loved this movie. But the plot was muddled and the dialogue was not snappy and they introduced other mutants that were to be potential X-men? What?
B00000J2PH|5.0|ONLY RECOGNIZE TWO OF HER SONGS BUT IT'S ENTERTAINING. ALSO BOUGHT CARLI SIMON CD AND FOU ND THAT TO BE BETTER BUT HARD TO OPEN
B005LAIHZE|5.0|I did not historically know lincoln had such a useful axe/gun.  He killed them things real good and helped this country to a better tomorrow.  I still think his with was show as a big of a homely lass.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I would highly recommend watching this show. It has it all. And it's sooo funny! Great writing as well wow
B0040I09RM|5.0|Action, drama, occasional laughs.  I love this show! I took me about a week to go through the entire 1st season.  Can't wait to start on season 2.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Rented it for my flight to FL. It was so interesting, it made my flight so fast. Couldn't beat the rental price.
1419707671|5.0|My son absoluty loves this series.  He's not really into reading - accept when it's just a bunch of silly fun.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Amazing!!! Absolutely love Ellen, her book shares real life  lessons through positivity light an  humor!! She is a true inspiration
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|nothing can beat an original and it remains the same even in this remake. this just has a horrible story line that seems to really go nowhere. such a shame.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|Having a lot of older slides that I wanted to convert to digital jpeg format and in light of generally good reviews from other users, I purchased this product..<br />Results: Very poor resolution and quite distorted colors.<br />A total waste of money.<br />The only thing good was the speed of fulfillment of the order (placed one afternoon and received the very next morning).
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I couldn't warm up to the author/doctor. He wasn't convincing enough and the book just wasn't compelling. My book group agreed that the topic was interesting, but the writing wasn't strong.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|Casting a heroine because she's in a popular TV show is demonstrably a mistake. Also wardrobe and hair were mostly way off. But the Beastly makeup was fabulous, and unlike most Beast concepts, at least allowed the actor access to the tools of his trade, namely his facial expressions. The soundtrack is pretty amazing. It's tragic that this movie didn't have a better script -- it seems to rely on you having seen every other Beauty-and-the-Beast movie, and expecting you to fill in the giant blank of how these characters fall in love. The Beast was trying heroically, but couldn't carry the whole movie with so many other factors being lacking. Alex Pettyfer still manages to make the Beast appealing and endearing. If they're going to expect you to make up the script in your own imagination, they at least give you a Beast who's inspiring!
0192789864|4.0|I wasn't expecting much out of this book, I was expecting everything but a good read. The story itself wasn't engrossing enough to get a 5 star but a 4 star is what I believe this book deserves.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Good plot, likeable characters, good flow to action.  Enjoyable read. First book in a series and will keep following these characters in the other books.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really love this alarm/clock it's great I use it each morning for my son it's good because I don't have a clock in my room so I love how a can use this app on my devices and its just like having a clock *****(= if your like me a regiment for u to try it I also love the fact that I just set the alarm all week and its all set so I so t forget to set it lol
B000FA675C|5.0|This is an interesting book. I recommend it strongly, if you enjoy a good mystery story. However, the plot is somewhat contrary to Christian doctrine.
B00C5R8364|5.0|That is what you are left to wonder when you finish The Kill List.<br />Forsyth is best when it comes to this type of fiction. Sorry he doesn't write more books.<br />He's a great story-teller who skips all of the &#34;secret-agent-falls-in-love-with -foreign-spy&#34; BS that is popular with his contemporaries. .
B0093LINVK|5.0|A perfect little HTPC. I'd say - a next generation of it.<br />It has enough juice to run everything , including 3D Blurays.<br />It has major advantages over previous Intel Atom based HTPCs - it has a superior graphics, much lower energy footprint,<br />very serious  CPU compare to under powered Atoms.<br />can run 1080p clips even without hardware assisted acceleration and (very important to me) - USB wakeup - you can wake it up from sleep by pressing a key on your USB based remote keyboard/mouse ( Atom based mini-PCs did not have that ability)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is like the best game ever! It's so fun and funny too! Also it keeps you and others entertained! =) I would definitely but a second one! Like minion rush 2 using stuff form despicable me 2! SO fun me and my aunt both LOVE minions!! 1000000000000000000 thumbs up!!! =D &lt;33333333333333
030758836X|5.0|Well, I finally read Gone Girl. I think I might have been the last person on the planet to read it. Most of my reading buddies had. And so many other books' advertising and reviews claimed to be \\"Like Gone Girl\\".  I loved it! My kind of mystery/thriller. I love how Flynn told the story---through Nick's real-time thoughts, and Amy's diary and then real-time thoughts. I also thought it was brilliantly conceived and planned...just like Amy's plan.  As I did when reading The Time Traveler's Wife, I kept trying to find a flaw in Amy's plan/story that would trip her up, but wasn't successful.  Hurray and congratulations to Gillian Flynn for writing such a thoroughly good read, and for the success it's brought her.
B000U6BT40|3.0|The show is Good fun and I like the tongue in cheek attitude. An fin take on suburban living with a twist.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief reads well, is rich in sensibility to a tough time in our history. I love the personification of Death. The figurative language reads like a rich tapestry.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am a fan of Hosseini's work already and this last one is very ambitious in scale but does not disappoint.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|This is the first TV show I have enjoyed in a very long time. Always something new yet very easy to follow.
1933952806|5.0|Great for beginning or moderately experienced photographer.  I was coming from the Canon system so I used it as an introductory tool to the camera and Nikon system itself.  Good introduction to the myriad of features and gives the user enough of an understanding to really explore said features.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Addicting. Keeps you guessing at every episode. Thought I had a good idea who the killer is bit then they keep you guessing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Ten levels of puzzles,  progressing from simple to extremely difficult. I only hope they actually come up with updates as we both wished it had lasted longer.
B009EBNSD2|4.0|Was hooked into from the beginning. I only gave it four stars as the ending seemed rushed and unlikely for the character.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|We got this as an extra charger for 2 different Samsung phones. Not all cords work/work well with them. This one works great so far. And it's not too short!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|Great book that all high school students and their parents should read.  Really makes you think about how your treatment of people might effect them the future.  A strong anti-bullying message comes through.<br /><br />***side note- I read this book in advance of my 7th grade daughter, as it was recommended by her teacher and she asked to read it.  Earliest reading age in my opinion, is ninth grade (14 years old).
0989524116|5.0|My granddaughter, who is a reluctant reader, asked for OUTLIN after she read Book One.  OUTLIN continued the suspenseful, mystical story. . .and now granddaughter can't wait for Book Three to complete the Inner Movement Trilogy.
B001EA4M7M|5.0|There have been many television and theatrical versions of Pride & Prejudice...and trust me when I say I own them all. Though BBC's 1980 version is obviously low budget (less outdoor scapes, secondary characters missing), it still seems more true to the characters and feelings of Ms. Austen's masterpiece. Lizzy is witty, endearing, and analytical; Darcy is stoic but eventually shows his softer side. While I do like the A&E version, I found the characterizations more modern, more emotive, and more reactive. You pick up on the brewing passion between Lizzy & Darcy almost immediately; you miss out on the intellectual process that the Lizzy of the novels goes thru in discovering her admiration and love of Darcy. I probably have watched this 100 times and never get tired of hearing Ms. Austen's words come to life in this faithful adaptation.
B00BIPKROU|5.0|Interesting cases, liked how she is always so serene and calm.  Well written and acted. Looking forward to more episodes.
B008A708E8|5.0|Voltaire it´s a classic. Never change. I´m happy because I got it. And it´s good to have with me all the time.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I have watched Dirty Dancing about 250 times, I annoy anyone within ear shot, reciting every line. It is a movie that you wished your childhood had been like. Amazing little film with lots of love and romance. The setting is amazing! If you haven't seen this movie you are missing out!!
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Steinbeck is a masterful story-teller. This novel should be read by anyone interested in American literature. Or if you just want to read a compelling story about human nature. Must read.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The series is great and a different concept for a program. They are all potray their characters very well especially the two leads....
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book had me mesmerized.  I kept thinking something else was going to happen, and then it didn't do what I expected.  It's not a story you'd love to talk about, but I just couldn't put it down!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is definitely worth reading. It is so well written and interestingly put together that I kept forgetting it was fiction. I loved it!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|On Season two now and can't get enough of this show. Already looking forward to getting the third season DVD.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I love this tv show.  It is a great feel good show.  It has great music, and it has very talented stars.
B0000256HE|3.0|The entire show seems rushed and incomplete. However it is Pink Floyd and is worth the effort of listening to it
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Remains as lovable as ever.    Jeff Cohen deserves a special Oscar for his portrayal of Chunk. Definitely the performance of a lifetime.    However, as a \\"now-parent\\", there were a few more dick jokes and mentions of the word 's***' than I care to remember.    Bear that in mind, but it remains a classic.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I don't give a &#34;true&#34; review to any of my digital books as I get so many that I'm not able to read them all in a timely manner; some wait a long time. Judged by my experience, I rarely find a book, whose purchase was based on the book's description on Amazon, objectionable due to language or moral issues. Therefore, the reason for the 4 Star rating.
B00EQNYOYU|4.0|I would rate it 4-4.5 stars. The constant build up from song 1 (intro) that transitions into a poppy &#34;Copy of a&#34; & &#34;Came Back Haunted&#34;, which are by far my least favorites on the album. Continuing into &#34;Find My Way&#34; & &#34;All Time Low&#34;, which are also remixed on this Deluxe Edition. Trent continues down a dark and narrowing playlist which seems to get darker and make my arm hair stand up even more as the LP progresses. Well done. As always, you cannot review a single song by NIN, you must listen to, and then comment on the entire album.

B00E1SJDJG|5.0|Dream River has been out a full day and a half and has yet to be reviewed on Amazon. It deserves better than that. This album isn't a \\"grower\\" in the sense that it's unsatisfying on the first listen and later opens up, but is immensely satisfying on the first listen and that feeling grows with time. What's taking everybody so long?<br /><br />Part of the problem may be the allusions by critics to Bill's previous album, Apocalypse, which was pretty inaccessible even by his standards. I generally worry for the state of humanity that Bill Callahan isn't more well-known and -loved, but on that record I get it. Apocalypse was dissonant, noisy, lyrically heavy, and rarely settled into a solid groove or melody you could wrap your arms around. What I consider the most appealing attribute of Callahan's songs -- a fairly simple beat or instrumental riff that gives him space to deepen his melodies and weave his lyrical yarns -- was almost completely absent on Apocalypse. Thus, for all the talk about how accomplished that album was, it was difficult to love. I imagine hearing that Dream River would be a \\"deepening\\" of Apocalypse's sound put some fans on edge.<br /><br />Lay your weary fears to rest. Dream River takes the best of Apocalypse -- along with the flute solos -- and melds them with Callahan's Sometimes I Wish We Were An Eagle, along with all other qualities that makes his music great. The percussion is minimal but propulsive, the guitars sing, the vocals are rich and confident, and each element contains melodic and rhythmic hooks for easy access and deep pleasure (for your ears). The lyrics are vintage Callahan: birds, nature, love, and life in a simpler time and place. Leonard Cohen is the standard comparison these days, in terms of the poetry of his words and the weathered voice singing them. There's also just the right amount of sludge, in case you were wondering where lo-fi Bill went.<br /><br />Here's to hoping this record receives the attention it deserves. It's Bill's best yet, and a legitimate masterpiece.Bill's best yet, and a legitimate masterpiece.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Seeing The Help for the second time was as good as the first.  It's one of those stories which presents an aspect of reality that makes one feel indignant, angry and yearning for justice.  And then the movie delivers.  The movie presents a picture of the US South in the nineteen fifties when Jim Crow was alive and &#34;well.&#34;  Thanks to one young woman who was educated and an aspiring journalist with her mind on things other than tomorrow's luncheon and next week's DAR meeting, the truth of the seething racism under the pretty, crinolined surface, came out.  A fight was waged, and well, I won't give away what happens.  See for yourself, a great movie.
B00B9366VO|4.0|A great documentary for any musician, recording enthusiast, or music fan. Who new so many hit records came out of that place?
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|This is a little different album for John.  He is letting us know that he has matured and mellowed some.  The musicianship in this album is outstanding and the songs are well appointed without John showing off his ability to play super fast and complicated like a lot of artists do.  Sounds like his guitar work was based on the rule that if it doesn't help the song sound better then don't do it.  John clearly has a desire to be in a long term relationship as the words to his songs relay that message throughout the album.  The more I listen to this album the more I want to listen to it.  Meaningful lyrics coupled with first class guitar work make this album a keeper for sure.  I love this album.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked that you got different points of views from different people . I didn't like that daisy died, this made me tear up and cry. I loved this book and it took me forever to get my hands on this book . A definite must read
B007SSDI2E|5.0|And HUgh was such a baby!  I loved the way it didn't weight heavily on the &#34;OMG I'm in the future&#34; aspect.  He just accept it and moved on.  For him, from the start,there was only Kate.  This is what romance novels (or movies) should feel like.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|Very elegant and simple. Wish it were a little faster paced. Overall a decent game. I'd recommend it to waste a little time.
B00EL8I8IS|2.0|There simply was nothing new.  From the opening credits, I could have predicted every single move.  There wasn't even anything &#34;wow&#34; about the special affects.  The whole movie felt like a  knock off for a few new-brand actors who weren't busy that month.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|After having the album for a couple of weeks I can say that I am extremely impressed with Trent's new album. With that said, I did have to take a couple good glances at the album as a whole before I made that decision.<br /><br />Sometimes as big fans we like to jump to conclusions and judge on first impressions. Whether those reactions are good or bad doesn't matter. It's the lasting impression that really matters. If I were to make this rating based on my first impression, I would've probably given this album 3 stars out of 5. As I have listened to this album on and off now for the period of time I've owned it, I have noticed a growing love for the album. That's when I know my love will continue to grow and I will enjoy an album for a long time after.<br /><br />Overall this album is just my cup of tea. Even though it was a little bitter at first, I kept sipping and realized how much my taste buds yearn for yet another taste. Good job Trent!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This was everything I wanted and more. I have arthritis and having a barometer is very important because I can pretty much predict a bad day by the pressure reading. Very easy to use and more info than I actually need based on my limited knowledge of weather in general. Excellent app!
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I'm forcing myself not to weigh in until I've tried it for a full month.  I'm on my third week.  After two weeks I put on my jeans and could tell I've lost some weight.  It's really not that hard.  I'm realizing that I am not going to die if I get hungry!  It actually usually passes after awhile.  Helpful hints: I filled my freezer with steam-in-the-bag veggies and individually packaged fish.  I've been sticking to eating mostly fish as my protein on my fast days- supposed to eat it a couple of times a week anyway, right?  Also, miracle noodles!  Just ate a whole bowl of &#34;noodle&#34; and mushroom stir fry for less than 50 cal!  I'm not grazing on my fast days.  If I'm really hungry at lunchtime, I'll have tomatoes and cottage cheese and then have a low calorie supper at 6 or so.  Otherwise I try to just eat one 500 cal meal at supper time.  I also try not to eat after 7 the night before and wait til lunch to eat the next day.  Buy a food scale to weigh what you're eating on fast days-way more accurate.  I'm fairly literate when it comes to nutrition so I'm not sure I needed the book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Ive used this app for a while now on my one year old kindle. loved it. the alarm clock is awesome.....especially with the mathematical questions.....lol....nothing like numbers to wake me up :)<br />its fun and I love it. I also use the time for my baking....its cool!!!!
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|The songs of his that I know from the radio are fantastic. Would enjoy a greatest hits cd from him. But the rest of his songs seemed to be in the wrong era. He does have a wonderful voice.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I downloaded this book on a recommendation from a family member; a few hours later, I was done with the book, wrestling with my emotions and telling friends about it. Great read which gives the reader the opportunity to reflect on their own beliefs and values though a story about relationships and connections.
B00F35BV64|3.0|How in the world did they morph all of the other star trek movies into one movie. While it was visually well done and had a lot of great scenes the fact that they rehashed so much of the other movies by just changing what happened to whom was disappointing.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|The author's style of writing gets you hooked early on in the book, like something bright and shiny that distracts you from the world around you. Good read, especially if you are interested in his other works (Looking for Alaska, The Fault in our Stars, etc.).
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Not for the faint of heart but great movie with a story line that never lets you down. I watched 3 different times and picked up more and more each time. A divergence of ideas and different from the book but well done.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Wow. Amazing. Exciting. Awesome. Enlightening. When th student is ready, the teacher will appear. This is a wonderful, thought-provoking story.
B000OYCMPI|5.0|After watching all 8 Jesse Stone movies, I realized I was already a fan of the writer Robert B Parker.  He also wrote Spenser for Hire and the Sonny Randall series.  Also the theme song and musical score were written by Jeff Beal who is an amazing composer...listen to the Jesse Stone theme song long enough and you will get the haunting melody caught in your head.  I know you will love this movie.  There are 6 more written by Parker and \\"Thin Ice\\" written by Tom Selleck.  Bucket list is to own and read all Parker books.  I recently bought the t.v. complete series of Spencer for Hire.  I own all but 4 books.  You will love it.
0446572985|5.0|Brilliant Baldacci,writing at the top of his game. A fast=paced page turner, with surprises and with emotions pulled from the reader's heart as the story moves along. Strong, believable characters, the reader finds herself cheering on the great and the good, while being saddened by seeing the murky underbelly of political and social ills which still plague us. A tightly woven, fast moving plot and muti-dimensional characters make this a fun and satisfying story told by a master storyteller.
B009RX8AQW|3.0|i really enjoyed the 1st season, but not this one, it's always about the same characters, it's always about i'm bad but i wanna be good, no wait i wanna stay bad.....;<br />many of the action scènes are ridiculous,  hard to find the big bad dangerous when all you need is just a sword to beat them......i sadly son't expect much from the show anymore
B00BV2LY1U|4.0|A good thrilling read. One Good Man, John Puller, is driven to serve his country in the US Military, and follows orders without question: until those giving the orders are far from decent people. The plot moves quickly, the setting is very, very depressing, but the reader is left to wonder to what lengths the US gov't. will go to protect some of its dirty little secrets. A fast, good read. Baldacci scores a hit with this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|OK. I haven't finished the game yet. Just started playing last night, but this game is awesome. Beautiful graphics and puzzles that require every aspect of the tablet to solve. Seems to follow kind of a Hellraiser story line without all the grisly details, but it did get creepy enough that I had to put it down last night.It seems that the deeper you get into \\"the box\\" the louder the whispers of unholy things become (of course that could have been  my imagination running wild at midnight, but it was spine tingling nonetheless). Puzzles require some thought, but aren't so difficult that you'll get frustrated and end up online looking for walkthroughs more than you're playing the game which is one of the things that always irked me about the Myst franchise.<br /><br />Not a bad purchase for $.99 which was just a portion of the free coins I got for my recent Kindle Fire purchase, so this was basically a free game for me anyway, but if someone were to take it away from me I would gladly pay the .99 to get it back.<br /><br />I see many reviews that it doesn't work with the Kindle Fire, but this must be a generational issue because it works great on my Fire which is just the LCD model and not even the HD device. Best I can say on this is verify the compatability notification in the purchase window before buying.<br /><br />All in all, extremely happy with this game. Can't wait to get back to it tonight.<br /><br />Oh...should also mention that this version comes with the \\"Epilogue\\" chapter which apparently is like a \\"The Room 1.5\\" kind of thing that will lead into the next game
B00CH87HF4|1.0|I was enjoying the game and progressing quite nicely. Then the game froze and kicked me off. When I tried to open it again it wouldn't load. Had to reinstall and lost everything. About three weeks of gameplay. Probably won't play it much again. I m just glad it was free or I'd be pretty upset about it.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|great way to lose weight without feeling deprived of taste and hunger. I highly reccommend this book for your next weight loss
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I started watching Fringe a couple of months ago and and I just got addicted to it! The show is so well-made and interesting that once you start watching it you won't be able to stop. This show reminds me a tv show I used to watch before but 10 times better!<br /><br />It's worth watching this show.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|The game it self is fine but NO I don't want to tell friends after the first board and NO I don't want to rate it already...
B0063M22QO|4.0|I really enjoy this game.  It does use a lot of battery though.  It's fun to play and ver entertaining.
B0039HV3P2|5.0|Believe it or not this version is tons better than the one with Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and William Holden.  Bogart and Holden were too old for their parts.
B0026ICMLO|5.0|Thanks
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|It was entertaining but not as good as I had hoped. Great cast and good idea though. Worth checking out but don't expect the best movie you've seen.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used this app for about ten days. I like the format of the information. I like it better than the Weather Channel App.
0762449314|5.0|Perfect little gift for Whovians, especially Dalek-lovers. Got this for my little brother for his birthday. The little booklet that comes with it has a brief history of the Daleks and shows all the different versions since the original. The Dalek itself is a really cool decoration, but probably wouldn't stand up to everyday play.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Good wit and the characters are easy to connect with . The whole brother sister thing  is silly. The movie was actually better in my opinion.
B005LAII80|5.0|I went to see this movie in theaters on a lark last year and was completely blown away. I LOVE everything about this movie.<br /><br />Karl Urban maintains a constant pained frown throughout the whole ordeal and never once shows his face. Every second of this movie is brilliant cinema.<br /><br />This also competes heavily with Coraline 3d for my favorite use of 3d in a movie. This is one of those films which it is worth buying a 3d tv for.<br /><br />I thought I might get tired of the film after a while, but I'm up past view 15 now and I would watch it at least 50 more times. I'm sure I will too.<br /><br />Dredd was a real sleeper in the brief time it was showing which I blame on that piece of garbage Rob Schneider was in a number of years back. I suspect everyone just steered clear because of latent fears and memories of that movie.<br /><br />Buy this movie right now. I can guarantee you it will be one of the best decisions you have ever made.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Great pictures of Astoria, OR, at the beginning.  As a former Astorian, I loved it.  The movie itself was filled with lots of action.  Kids will love this.  Only negative to me was the kids said a few swear words, but it wasn't too bad.
B00F8GYC1Y|2.0|I ordered this but I can't find it on my Kindle no matter where I look. It is not under apps or anywhere.
B00DJ735KI|5.0|What a wonderful update and powerful presentation on the epic-genetic subject. It is a must read if you are currently a high school biology teacher.
B00E8JZILA|4.0|Mild load lag. Overall great port. Season 1and1-5 400 days all in one.if you have a vita, well worth it.
B000002H38|4.0|Loved this cd for years...took me back to good times, great voice, not run of the mill...soft and soul-full,music to smooch to!
B004UPANAI|2.0|Jackman does a great job but the dialog is awful.  Painful to watch at times.  The second half was a little better.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|My kids loved the movie. It was a heart warming and relatively clean movie, which seems to be harder and harder to come by these days.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Funny, witty, well cast, great acting.<br /><br />I would like them to spend a *little* more time on the technical issue of the lawsuits.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|got this app for free for a four and six year old and so far so good.  cute graphics,  tasks and quests.  onlything is the waiting times for getting new pets and Accessories.
B003477DVK|4.0|Nice movie to watch with your kids. The movie is very emotional and reflects true companionship from the very pet we all love - dogs
B000VI12ZS|5.0|Excellent movie for those interested in the history of WW II.  If you have Native Blood walk proud.  This is a true story.
B005XUC398|4.0|Movie truly reflects what happened and markets crashed even though there is not much focused on the aftermath. It is left to imagination
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down!!  I loved how every detail was thought out right up to the end!!
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Fantastic movie. Really, there are two movies in one. There is the first Boot Camp portion and then the second Vietnam portion. Both have tremendous insight into the life of a Marine (or soldier).
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Always fun and I am never bored. I enjoy playing with my brother and sister. My mom even has fun. I got my dad even into it. He doesn't play games like that.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|Like Al Pacino in this role! One of the best movie of all time.  Like the credits and history behind making the movie.
B00005UWMX|5.0|couldn't watch the movie because I bought the wrong region but I have seen the movie and loved it. thanks
B009KS4XRO|4.0|fun and quick, only thing I don't like I run out of cards to fast yes I would recommend to friends
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman has given us a beautifully written and deeply meaningful reflection on the source and power of fear within us that has its roots in childhood. Told from the vantage point of middle age, the narrator's story raises memories of a childhood experience that was both frightening and empowering. Throughout his remembrance, the reader is drawn into the frightening reality, but wonders also how true the memory is. Was the frightening experience a product of imagination or from real events - or both. I found it touching and revealing of my own sense of both fear and memory. At the end, the narrator says that different people remember the same event in different ways. Implied in his reflection is the truth that as we move on, our own memory of earlier events can become different as well. A beautiful parable about fear and a poignant meditation on memory. This little book has become a personal favorite.
B00821OX98|2.0|Mostly unwatchable. I had to give up after a few episodes. I'll watch pretty trashy stuff for more than a few episodes. This was unbearable.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|If you love SCI-FI..You cannot go wrong with this movie, and to my opinion is the best of the Transformers series.....This is the only Transformers movie that I wanted to own because, I really do not enjoy cars turning into gigantic robots....However...The Computer Graphics in this movie are truly GREAT....Wonderful views of Chicago throughout  the movie.  Sorry, this beauiful city had to be destroyed in the movie...LOL....But the photography is truly great and so is the acting.....I bought it for the sheer beauty of its computer graphic...a must for every collector that loves the genre....Again, cars turning into robots is not my forte of favorite movies...BUT...I do make an exception for this wonderful Transformers flick.......And yes, the blue ray version, was worth every penny I paid for it........
B00B2166BS|5.0|Make the Nexus 10 so much easy to charge! It always stay in my room, ready to charge my tablet when I go to sleep. I hope other products will make use of this Mac-like technology!
B00CRW2066|5.0|It takes a few listenings before you start to get it. I like that the songs open up to you with some familiarity.
086571701X|5.0|The book is easy to follow with many illustrations. It is enjoyable to read as the author offers much encouragement to the beginner in aquaponics. The subject matter is covered in adequate depth and I feel confident that I can begin my aquaponics system upon finishing it.
B003BKF696|5.0|It takes a few listenings before you start to get it. I like that.  The songs open up to you with some familiarity.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in quite a while. Mark Ruffalo is making a habit of surprising me with great performances, and he does it again in &#34;Now You See Me&#34;. The rest of the cast were outstanding as well.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I am sure someone worked really hard to change this ap, but now it is so user unfriendly I will be uninstalling. Where are the easy shortcut icons that were at the bottom of the screen? Why is the radar map not responsive? If I can find a way to revert to the older version I will keep the ap, but if not I am discarding the new version.
B00F91H666|4.0|Interesting movie with more than just zombie shoot-up action. Instead of an evil coporation or devious military experiment, the movie seemed to make it realistically believable if an event like this could happen. Good acting with action sequences interspersed throughout the movie to keepthe flow of the movie going. I am not always a fan of zombie movies, but I did read the book and the movie adaptation was done pretty well considering you have a two hour movie to get the book across.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|i have wanted this app for a long time. It is excellent. If you're looking for a calendar/task app. this is the one to get. well worth the money. IMO.
0802473156|5.0|A clear guide to better understanding of relationship dynamics.  Helps in solving problems in communicating with your significant other.  Easy-to-understand workbook style for learning.
B0012HEB32|4.0|and I don't see any way to return it. nothing against the series, but we have a prime account so why waste $14 for the season when you can watch it for free. i enjoy the show just fine. If you like sci-fi, robot type stuff then this should be right up your alley. Anyway, that's what I get for taking a phone call while watching/exercising early in the am. I know better than that.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Very engaging honestly told story. At times you find yourself angry with the author but you always find yourself cheering for her. She exhibits insight and courage, and is very descriptive. Makes you want to do the hike!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Phenomenal fun. Still enjoy watching it after five years, and the chemistry between Nathan and Stana is so rare to find on TV today. Can't get enough of it.<br /><br />Although the case was cracked when I received the DVD set! The DVDs were unaffected so I can live with it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app - I think I am addicted! Very easy to use. I like that it keeps track of score, time and moves.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Spine tingling suspense! It's impossible to watch just one episode at a time. I often find myself lost in the plot as though I am one of the characters.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|such a  good read couldn't put it down  finished  right before the movie and so thankful I did. I think  that had I just seen the movie I would've been totally lost.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is fun and challenging! ive been playing for an hour and I cant stop. great idea for people who love puzzles.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Great season. The introduction to the whole story is fantastic in this first season. Highly recommended. A bit in the style of X files
B000JCSBU0|1.0|Did you know that opiates make people's pupils constrict rather than dilate? Well, Aranofsky sure doesn't. If that were the only basic fact of drug use he didn't understand it wouldn't be a problem, but the portrait of addiction in this film could only appeal to someone who prefered to revel in sick fantasy rather than truth. If you get off on watching other people getting off and then being brutally punished for the sin of seeking pleasure, you should at least have the satisfaction of a little more realism and a little less self-satisfied nonsense.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is an excellent program...cannot wait to see the next episode.  Very well done.<br />The BBC has great shows like this, but I am not able to get BBC America on my<br />cable system.  Thankfully Amazon is there for me, and I can get them the day after<br />they air on tv.  Thank you, Amazon!!!
B00633PFQC|5.0|A book that offers more questions than answers in order to raise awareness about the inconspicuous &#34;commodification&#34; of modern society. Truely a fantastic book.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|Nicely described the essencials, I read before my first brew and enjoyed it a lot. I recommend for all my friends.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I loved it! I'm not a very good book reviewer, I'm just a very good reader. This one flew by. Engrossing to say the least. We've got sci-fi, mythology, a travelogue of sorts, fantasy...American Gods has it all. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend you do so!
B004ZH66XO|1.0|Remember back when you could go to a store and buy a computer game? They had many levels...you could play them for days...now we only get offered Apps...little peices of games filled with adds. spyware and malware. And if they dont...well wait around til the next update and it will.  in game purchases..i could go on all day.  The internet...even the places you are suposed to be safe...are just lawless throwbacks to the wild west with everyone out for themselves  not caring who they hurt and no one to stop them even when we know what they are doing.
0316212261|5.0|I'd been given the 1st one as a gift - read it and promptly sent for the set. Adventurous non-conformist female protagonist! Enjoyed every one.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This show never ceases to amaze me. I love Olivia and Peter and find the science intriguing. I just love this show.
B007704HO6|5.0|A wonderful book, telling a  warm hearted story about Bob and James who adopted each other and both help through the problems of life.
B00BX8PG4S|4.0|a really good movie taking place around the time of the cuban missle crisis.....it stated that the story was based on actual events
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome.<br />Everyone I know loves it and I do too.<br />It is totally worth the money.<br />miecraft mine and craft
B004I8WD6E|3.0|works well for my 4s as a protective case ;-),<br />if you like simple, you will like this one ;-)
B00EQRP5LW|5.0|Great Album! John Legend has done it again. He has masterfully fused his smooth vocals with melodies that captures your soul.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Very addictive  ,  everyone dies.  Make sure you start from season one and turn up the volume The English love to whisper.
B000R9J3XE|5.0|Very original & complex music compositions that have very interesting lyrics coupled with musical mastery. A couple of the songs are<br />so-so but as a whole, a fantastic collection of songs which has become one of my favorite CDs.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Well written and definitely a must read.  I was sad it was over.  Loved the twist and turns and the ending was so refreshing.  Life rarely ends in happily ever after but in survival. Thank you
B008WD3EQE|5.0|Everything I was looking for; plus a fantastic seller! Original vintage copy with original release sleeve, in great condition.  Worth the price if you're looking at what I consider to be a collector's item and great music.
B000VR824S|5.0|This is the second Eric Clapton Crossroads concert which gathers the greatest guitarists on one stage. Crossroads is one of the best music dvds ever. You will also want Crossroads 2004, 2010 and 2013.
B009CFXKJ2|5.0|A classic movie with more quotable lines than most.  An amazing cast of characters, most with large flaws, that is very entertaining.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is a great fun-filled movie for the family. The animation is really good and the story line is good.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Packaging is slim, and simple. I could have done without the extra sleeve, but it's not a big thing.<br /><br />Great movie. Great Audio and Visual quality.
B002OR18HQ|5.0|John Fogerty is perhaps the most unique sound and guitar that is distinctive to music lovers.  From Creedence Clearwater revival to is solo career, john is one of the best entertainers you will ever see and not be bored.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Great Season, Great Show.<br /><br />Not much more I can say...<br /><br />Packaging is slim and easy to open. Video and Audio quality are both awesome.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|book provided good background on an idea of what it takes to become a SEAL.  The events that led to this book are detailed and puts you right in the action.  Even the details of the sense of community from his home town.  Im a ny, and i want to move to texas.
B004132I20|5.0|Packaging is slim and simple. Doesn't fall open, but isn't difficult to open. The quality of the sound and picture are excellent. Great tv show.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book, as well as the two others after it! This story makes it where you can not put the book down. A must read! Just wish there were more than the three books.
B009NY43NY|1.0|We, the loving and loyal Sookie fans, deserve a much better book.  I want a rewrite, Charlaine Harris!<br /><br />I always had a feeling Sookie would end up with Sam but their relationship in this book was so badly written.  It felt so rushed especially after having so many books dedicated to Sookie and Eric's relationship.  There was no build up, no romance and no loving connection between them.  It was awkward and disappointing.  What a sad way to wrap up a really good series.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I only had this game for a few hours and I gotta say, it's pretty fun. Really cool things have been added to this one. These games are always so addicting!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|couldn't put it down  loved it!!  It read like an action novel,  couldn't believe what he went through and survived!!
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie but it was not very good.  The story was hard to follow and very little character development.  The ending was okay but predictable.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|If you're a fan of Anthony Bourdain this is a must read. I understand how he got the position on &#34;no reservations&#34; after reading it. It really explains how his love of food gave him the drive to explore and create the best food around. I'm an even bigger fan after reading this.
B006YC74E8|5.0|Love this app! Very user friendly!  And I have had it less then a week & they have already added a few new features!  I have a 4 year old grandchild I love taking pics of and have enjoyed the app to make me a little more creative!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This game is highly addictive. And yes be warned it gets pretty difficult. My son and I were practically fighting over the kindle.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I have been delighted with my case cover.  Like the name<br />implies it is lightweight which is important to me as I carry<br />my Kindle Fire in my purse for when I am caught in lines<br />or waiting in a doctors office.<br />This case is durable and fits my hand so well or I can prop<br />it up on my tummy for reading while I am lying down.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I love a book that you cannot predict the outcome. It was worth hanging in there till the very end. Many surprises. Well written. Interesting the way it goes back and forth in time with two different juries but the same prosecutor.
B0000640VM|5.0|Disney classic. My son came home from school not to long ago saying he watched Oliver and Company. Later I he saw it at the store and asked if he could own it. I said we would look online found a used copy in my state for a good price. It arrived yesterday we watched it together, it was fun to rewatch a movie that I loved that's now passed down to my son.
030746363X|2.0|WAY to much information in just the weight sections. Followed the &#34;instructions&#34; as best as I could. Gained weight. not good.
B00CLO3G54|4.0|I love Whoopi Goldberg... and if I were not required to use 8 more words I would have quit back there @ Goldberg!!
B009GESJH2|4.0|I like this cd. It`s not like it`s the best cd. But still it`s good. The song that I like the best is (Chickens in the pen) And (Let`s Ride).To me it`s good  and a fun cd. Kid Rock can still rock it out!!!!. This cd. came just in time and for a good price, I like the new kid rock less rap and more rock and this cd. will rock.!! Thanks.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It was a movie worth seeing. Had much the same sense of feel to it as \\"I Am Legend.\\" But I wouldn't watch it again. I suggest you just rent and not buy it.
0375842209|5.0|I loved this book. What lovely writing, such a beautiful story. And the ending.... wow... that will stay with me forever. Some may consider this a Young Adult book, but it is much more powerful than that... I recommend it for any age. At first I had a little trouble adjusting to the unique way that it is written... but once I got the hang of it, I loved that about it also. I will definitely read this book again in the future.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I am so sick of this game. The developers suck enough money out of players with the ridiculously overpriced IAP, and then they introduced ads that pop up every time you open it or change the screen. Now it's a freaking video ad. Between this and the constant connectivity issues (yes, you have to be connected to the Internet to play, but their game server frequently kicks us off, and the app frequently crashes), I'm just sick of it. At least my 4 year old doesn't play it much, so he won't be too upset. Uninstalling.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Made me want to go back and watch some of the old ones again. This is very entertaining. Great effects.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I havent been using it for very long but it seems to work well. I like the predictions. As i type more and more it gets better. sometimes i just tap the predictions to type an entire message. :)
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Great effects, Beautiful scenery. I would like to watch it again. Very enjoyable entertainment. I recommend it ~ interesting video of a classic.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|The game is fun. There are very interesting mini puzzles throughout the game.  I recommend this to anyone who likes a challenge.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Loved it. It was fun and slightly less confusing than the first - but like my husband said, I just enjoyed the ride and I will figure out the details of the story later. I don't sit down to watch these kinds of movies expecting to be wowed on a deep intellectual level, but rather to be entertained and this movie did that for me.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Jack's friends are dead! He is  found by another former MP. The story accelerates quickly into another excellent page turner.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|So I  received this and assembled it in accordance with the pictures and instructions.  Purpose for purchasing was to remove the bottoms from wine bottles with the remaining top porting being used over votive candles.  The first 12 I tried on my own without assistance and had a 50% success rate.  I used a small cooler with water and ice and a simmering pot of water on the stove.  After scoring correctly level around the bottles, quickly dipping the bottle in the simmering hot water to just beyond the score line for 5-10 seconds, removing and dipping in ice cold the same way and repeating the dipping process one more time the bottoms would just fall off.<br /><br />Executing a level score around the bottle was difficult by myself as the tool could move down the bottle if not extremely secure.  This would cause the score to not be at the same level around the bottle and as a result the break would be hap-hazzard.<br /><br />For best results, I used a light oil on the cutter and oiled the bottle around the entire area intended for scoring (used a cutip).  This keeps the scored area open until submerged in the water.  Additionally having another set of hands holding the tool steady at the top of the bottle so I only needed to concentrate on turning the bottle and scoring along the bottom created much better results.  This method resulted in a 11 out of 12 success rate.<br /><br />Your results may very, but I was satisfied with the purchase and would recommend to others.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Excellent! The only part that I have trouble with is there is no mention of his previous dealings with the FBI or other agency. His Army MP record keeps coming back, but nothing else. He is in NY. Where is the General's daughter??
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Plot is good but writing/editing leaves a lot to be desired. There are many cases of repeated words and sentences.
006224454X|4.0|This was a book loaned to me by a friend! Not my typical genre, but was good! Kept my attention through and through! I have recommended to my friends that enjoy this genre! I was shocked at the end... in a good way!
B0024HH32A|5.0|I love watching this with my uncle when I was little and I have never grown tired of it. Glad I was able to find it on Blueray!
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|I don't even like Crime Dramas. But this one is heavily character driven, which is what I look for in any story. The show isn't about the mysterious murder of a young boy as it is on the effect of said murder on his family and the small town that he lived and died in.  The police are lead to multiple dead ends before they find the unlikely culprit, and in the process they unearth the many secrets the seemingly sleepy towns inhabitants keep.
B001YV506S|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a family member. I've never seen the movie myself, but it shipped fast and was in good condition.
B009WUBERW|5.0|This was an excellent film with a great cast of charactors.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for great thrill ride.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was extremely scary and thrilling.  The individual accounts of the zombie encounters was very realistic and creepy.  Very well written.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Really enjoyed all the Harry Hole series. Fast reading and extremely interesting, the trail of subtle and not so subtle clues along the way.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is crazy...it may look boring but it is supper addicting this game will keep you busy for hours believe me you need to try it out!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Just really love the Harry Hole character.  I have read every book of this series and am wishing there were 10 more.  Hopefully.
0061353248|1.0|Very disappointing.<br /><br />Lots of experiments and reasoning is completetly invalid. For example, if the price of oil would be higher, in the long term it would not change the human behavior. Of course, the behavior will change. People will buy more fuel efficient cars and new types of cars (electric  etc.) will emerge. Just look what happened in the past.<br /><br />Also, he refers to 'humans' when he actually talks about himself. I certainly do not behave like he is describing. Also, in other cultures people behave in a totally different way from the way he is describing.<br /><br />The 'great ideas' about optimizing healthcare by making it mandatory to undergo medical tests... I hope I will never live in such a society.<br /><br />I am surprised that he is teaching anything and that anybody would listen to his 'lectures'.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very intense game for me. I just cannot seem to put it down. Top Shelf!!! My favorite game out of them all.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great app. Love all the different ways you can customize your alarm. I also love that you can set multiple alarms and can have a different alarm for every day if you wake up at different times.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|. It's so much funIt is just the best game ever it's so amazing get it now you won't regret it
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I love this author and her imperfect protagonists and endings that are twisted like the Twilight Zone. I can't wait until she writes a fourth book.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|At first I thought this would be another easy escape game. But it has challenged me for hours. Thumbs Up!!!
B002GMSMHS|4.0|Ordered July 18 for vacation starting Aug 30.  Product arrived Aug 28.  Just barely in time.  Worked great. Took over 800 pictures with plenty of memory left.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's great! But your notifications you have to refresh you self! It gets really annoying! If It got an update wouldn't be as bad! :)
B00C5R8364|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  I was captivated and could not put it down. I cannot wait for his next one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is my favorite game it's so addition cause I just wanna complete one puzzle so I can go to the next  the only thing I wish there was like a lol side game or something to earn more coins faster
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest! Best app ever, whatever your interests. Decorating, cooking, art, fashion, funny quotes, serious quotes, wedding planning, DIY furniture, crafts, home remodeling.........it's all here
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was well written nicely detailed and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time and I just couldn't put it down it made me feel like I was percy and all this stuff was happening to me like I was in the book not just reading it
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I review 3-D only for films and while this one starts with sharp focus and clean views the Director loses 3-D direction. Blur image and lens flair become epidemic though the high Def human condition is refreshing. Every human flaw seems to present adding to the realism that's needed just because of lens flairs alone. Over all though I was not too disappointed and this film beats those Marvel rip offs where 3-D is concerned. Directors need to learn that 3 - D is about being there surrounded by the events and not their own stylized vision.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|OMG I can't believe I missed this show when it started.  It is sooo funny, like laugh out loud funny.  Problem is I can't stop watching.  I  saw season 1 in 1 day and now half way through season 3 on day 2.  Not much time for other stuff, like work....................  oh well!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this game.  It is more realistic than others I've played.  You'll probably enjoy it too. Why not try it.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is an awesome sequel to the first Angry Birds Star Wars. More levels, more characters, and the Pork Side!!!  The only thing Rovio needs now is an Angry Birds Lord of the Rings, or Hobbit...
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really liked this book. Easy to get in to and then easy to stay hooked. Definitely will read again.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Recommended by my friend, another librarian, I read it straight through in two sittings. The language of the flowers woven throughout the book reinforces the process of healing described.  A great read.  A redemptive story of love.  Highly recommended.
B008SAZHLQ|3.0|Good teen romance, but nothing special. Kept the pages turning so that I could finish what I started, otherwise the plot is expected and predictable.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|I was expecting this movie to be a brainless (haha) action flik but what I found was an action flik with brainz. It had the advantage of a well written story and quality actors but movies with greater potential have still fallen short of delivering. The action begins after you get through the first 10 minutes of &#34;lightweight&#34; character development. The movie is intense, lot's of twists, and never sits still too long.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves sci-fi, zombies, or action films.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|can t imagine a society like that  no regard for human life  thank god its just a story for now
B00ANTX3HA|5.0|The Fog Of War is a powerful documentary that sheds light on ins of the most important people behind the scenes in American warfare — Robert McNamara. It is straightforward, but effective. Director Errol Morris doesn't hide his involvement, acting as an off-camera interviewer, but his questions are pointed and serve only one purpose, which is to shed light on McNamara's long history both as an efficiency expert in the Air Force and later as Secretary of Defense under Kennedy and Johnson.<br /><br />McNamara is candid and direct as an interview subject, and his responses make it abundantly clear that he is a man with a heavy, weary conscious. It is a chilling, insightful film.

He's a 6'4\\" hunk of gorgeousness who'll take any risk, fight any foe, and get out of the most horrifying situations just so that you, the average Joe/Joelene, can sleep safe in bed at night. He's the world's best sniper, best fighter, and most intelligent strategist. And he's humble! What's not to love? Actually love, love, love. He could park his boots under my bed anytime. I don't even think my husband would object because he's pretty enamoured as well!<br /><br />I've read all the books in the series (apart from No 12 \\"Nothing to Lose\\" which received very bad reviews - and I'll probably give in and read that sometime) and will be posting this review for them all.

B004EPZ0H0|4.0|A part of me thinks I should give this book five stars.  It is well written, brings very weighty ethical issues into the open, and pays tribute to the woman from whom the HeLa cells originated.  The book also highlights the damage caused by a lack of education: ignorance, limited opportunities, and a struggle to cope with an ever changing world.  Plus the author did a very good job of incorporating a great deal of scientific data in a way which was accessible to a reader with little science background.  But the book left me with a feeling of disquiet which I haven't been able to resolve.  Was Skloot right to include the less salubrious information about Henrietta's family, or is it just more exploitation?  As I said, I'm conflicted on this issue.
B0041L8ZRY|5.0|SUPER LUME on all the hour markers including the inverted triangle at the 12 o'clock position. The day/date window is clearly legible. The thin, polished bezel will be less prone to scratch. Large dial opening even on my small wrist is easy to handle. I have had no problems with previous Malaysian movements. ALL automatics can vary sometimes. This has a very genuine military look, and the case thickness is not like wearing a  cooking pot on your wrist. The bracelet does not squeak and is comfortable;I just had it sized.I would like to make a special note regarding the shipper Global Time. They were EXTREMELY and UNUSUALLY FAST for a non-Prime eligible product, and the packing and sealing of the watch, including a nice box was a bit of a surprise at this price point. The crown,by the way, is push-pull and not oversized. The crystal does not distort viewing the dial when held at an angle. I hope this info helps you. I'm a person who likes to enjoy my watch without regard to whether it's a high-end piece or not. THIS one I'm enjoying.

B008I43DYU|1.0|Divide 20 by 144. It's answer is 1.388..... Not even close, right? Answer should be less than one. Perhaps this is a defect when dividing any lesser number by 144.  But since 144 is a common number to use in the construction trades - the number of inches in 1 square foot- I'd say it is a major drawback - even tho' it becomes obvious it's simply displacing the decimal point. BUT- if you can't trust a calculator with basic math functions, why use it?  And to have paid for it with $$, it becomes a full fledged ripoff. Nice looking interface with the large, albeit incorrect, numbers, though.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is an extremely difficult device to set up.  It requires you to download an application on your PC or phone.  On a PC, it requires your PC to have 'native' WiFi.  That means that the chrome cast application has to be able to directly access the WiFi interface.  My PC has a USB wireless adapter that uses a separate WiFi interface, so no luck there.  Then I tried to use my MacBook Pro laptop.  The setup detects the unit, then shifts your WiFi to join a ChromecastXXXX network (XXXX is a number assigned to your device).  You are then given the address 192.168.254.253 to connect to the unit.  Once you verify a code on the unit, you provide the unit you WiFi network and key.  The unit and my laptop then both rejoin my WiFi network.  Here's where the problem comes in.  Your WiFi router must support uPNP, otherwise you can't find the Chromecast device.  Since I use a work provided router, no luck there.<br /><br />So I had an old DLink wireless router, that supports uPNP, and I tried to set it up again from my Apple laptop.  After going through the steps again, I couldn't find the Chromecast again.  Again no joy.  Finally I downloaded the Chromecast application onto my iPhone.  The setup on an iPhone requires you to manually shift the phone's WiFi settings, which I did.  I finally got a Ready to Cast message on the screen.  I tried casting Netflix from my iPhone, but found it took forever to load content.  It did finally work, though.<br /><br />My AppleTV unit has wired and wireless interfaces, and has a remote control.  I can stream content from my iTunes library or directly from my devices.  Even though it is significantly more expensive ($99 vs $35), it simply works better.<br /><br />I've seen many Android stick PCs on the market at the sub $40 price range, and I will admit that Google's Chromecast is much better designed.  It came with an HDMI extension which wasn't needed since unlike Android stick PCs, this one was slim enough to fit into the HDMI port withoutcrowding other HDMI cables.  it has a long micro-USB cable for power, and the TV's USB port powered the unit with no issues.  An AC adapter is also provided.<br /><br />Google just tried to be too cute with it's WiFi antics.
B007JRUCGO|4.0|This was really fun and both my kids enjoyed the movie. My daughter liked the theme of the movie in keeping with nature. My son just really loves fluffy penguins. Grab the popcorn, sit on the couch and spend some time with the family enjoying this film.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|For the first time ever, I find the TV series and the book series wonderful together.  To me, it did not matter that I had seen the show entirely already and now that I am ahead of the show, it will not matter that I know some parts when the series returns. The writer successfully adds intrigue and new concepts to both. Frankly I am bored when shows follow books too literally.  But I am also disappointed if the quality of one is inferior to the other.  I am very satisfied with both.  No disappointments so far.

1400069742|5.0|This is a book of history, but as the saying goes, we are condemned to repeat it.<br /><br />One need only look at recent headlines to know why I consider this work to be of vital importance. Should America's role in the world be one of intervention or isolation? Is our treasure worth spending, our blood worth spilling, to prevent genocide? Would stopping one enemy only create another?<br /><br />Whether you agree with Lindbergh or FDR, Obama or Ron Paul, I highly recommend this book. The author tells this story in a captivating way, building urgency and tension as the world sinks ever further into war. One would not expect a 500-page history text to read like a novel, but such is Ms. Olson's skill. Five stars.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|It is not as good as the original movie; however it ok to watch once. It's a movie that requires you to turnoff your brain to enjoy.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|If you have not grown tired of the Angry Birds series - and I will confess to returning to these games during periods of boredom - then this latest release will not disappoint. The graphics and sound effects are amazing for the platform and the Star Wars tie-in is more than just cosmetic: your birds (or pigs!) use light-sabers and the Force. A great game overall, but minus one star for pushing in-app purchases.

B00CEB5QU2|3.0|Kingston tried really hard to please customers across multiple platforms with the MobileLite Wireless, but in the process probably made this card-reader and content streamer less powerful than it might have been to keep it at a reasonable entry-level price. I put the unit through its paces on several Mac laptops and an iPad, as well as on an older Windows desktop, and it handled file transfers reliably.<br /><br />Downloading the MobileLite app was not an issue, but I am not a fan of the design and functionality of the app. In addition, I would have appreciated the option of being able to plug this unit into my router's USB port so that it could have functioned behind my firewall while taking advantage of its ability to stream content to up to three devices.  In addition, streaming would be more versatile if the device could sip power from a source other than a computer with a USB port; more on this issue below.<br /><br />I prefer to explore printed documentation thoroughly while getting acquainted with new devices, because I can highlight phrases and add my notes. Although a manual is not included, it is relatively easy to find tutorial videos, product information, and PDFs of manuals on the Kingston website. Please see the \\"comments\\" section for further information. Multilingual manuals for Apple and for Android devices are available for download; the following comments pertain to the former. Although the MobileLite manual walks users through the various parts of the unit and how to use it, the guide provides only cursory information about how to preserve wireless functionality when using wireless-enabled Apple products.  If you have been encountering problems, visit the manual for an explanation of how to ensure your device is in bridge mode.  I do think that Kingston should have provided this information more prominently and more thoroughly to avoid frustration for beginning users. (I do not have Android products, so am unable to address whether bridging is an issue for them; in any case, the manual specifically mentions iPads and iPod Touches.)<br /><br />Similarly, the FAQ information is online, which may not be ideal if you are in search of help on the road when using your smart phone. Although several basics are covered, Kingston does not address approved ways to charge the unit if you are on the road without a laptop. The only references I could find about charging the MobileLite are to plug the device into a USB port on your desktop or laptop computer; it would be helpful to know to know whether the unit can handle being connected to a car charger or wall charger with a USB port.<br /><br />Using the included USB-to-micro USB cable, you can operate this to read from and write to a micro-SD card on Windows XP through 8; Mac OS X Version 10.6 or higher; and on Linux Version 2.6 or higher. Similarly, you can use it wirelessly on everything from Android and Kindle Fire devices to the spectrum of iPads and iPhones, with access backward-compatible to the iPhone 3G, the iPod Touch, and the first version of iPad, as long as they are using at least iOS 5.1. Kudos to Kingston for remembering its cross-platform heritage and for making this device usable by devices and operating systems earlier in those manufacturers' product life cycles. As Apple leaves behind the original iPad and iPhones older than the 4 in its latest iOS this fall, I hope Kingston continues to support those devices rather than helping to usher them into needless obsolescence.issue for them; in any case, the manual specifically mentions iPads and iPod Touches.)<br /><br />Similarly, the FAQ information is online, which may not be ideal if you are in search of help on the road when using your smart phone.

These same picky dweebs probably think \\"The Green Berets\\" with John Wayne was realistic, but having served in Viet Nam I can tell you that the last scene in the movie where Wanye is on the beach at sundown is totally wrong. There is no coast line on Viet Nam's west border. And they probably think that Platoon was  also a true representation---NO WAY!!! Get a life and watch an outstanding film with truly great acting instead of picking apart evary scene!
B006885EFE|5.0|This is a can't miss, have to watch series. I will recommend this movie to anyone. It is the best series ever!
B00F2362IE|1.0|I couldn't even even play game.  I bought a game and it says I don't own app.  My kid is crushed. Bad review before even playing. Truly pathetic.  Then I get a foreign country when I call about it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this book to my daughter (age 9), and we both really enjoyed it.  It's very well-written, and really helps open your mind to think of what life is like for this boy with facial deformities.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The Chromecast is cute as a bug, as the children used to say, but alas neither my laptop nor my smartphone nor my Kindle Fire HD will get the thing up and running. I would give it a single star except for the fact that it's so danged CUTE. So I am going to keep it around until such time as I upgrade my phone or laptop to one that Google will deign to recognize, or else until I find a friend who can use it. For $35, why return it?
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a good rendition of the book. Of course there is no way to keep everything from the book. There are important losses but the story is there, the spirit is there, and it is beautiful visually.
0385528787|4.0|If you have not read [[ASIN:0385721676 Oryx and Crake]] and [[ASIN:0307455475 The Year of the Flood]], you must before reading Maddaddam. It isn't my favorite of the series but only because I think it does not stand alone as strongly as the other two. Oryx and Crake introduced us to two fascinating characters that set up the event for their end. In The Year of the Flood, we see the world they lived in and the results of the said event from several different prespectives. Maddaddam is a look back through the eyes of Zeb. In Year of the Flood, Zeb is an enigma. He was not like the others and a shady past was alluded to. While his background makes for an interesting story, there were moments when I wondered how this was integral to the rest. At times it seems like he was the one to tie the other characters together. But it was done almost too neatly. What are the chances that the survivors are all linked? And there are glimpses of Adam but he remains shrouded in mystery, which may have been Atwood's intent. But why reveal one side of the story and not the other? (I realize this question may not make sense if you haven't read the book but I hate to give away too much.)<br /><br />Margaret Atwood creates a post-apocalyptic world that is terrifying mostly because it is all too close to our near future - the scientific advances, the experiments, the mass consumerism, the lack of privacy. It can be taken as a cautionary tale but I enjoyed it more because to me, it was a satirical commentary on our society. Weeks later, I am still thinking about it. Do we learn from our mistakes? Is the need for history, oral and written, only human? And what about our need for an explanation of where we came from, a god to worship and attribute to all things?
0307730700|5.0|I was blown away by this book about a man with traits that I wish I could posess. His never give up attitude was unbelivible.  This book every one should read and be inspired by.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It was better than I thought it would be but I kept expecting the girl to start kicking ass since the whole things was that she wanted an adventure but then she just lets Jack have all the glory and it was kinda lame.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Fun game, just gets monotonous over time. I&acute;m only on level 56 of the first section so it will be interesting to see how it will progress
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is such a fun movie and Ben Stiller as a runway model. It was just too much. Good comedy never goes out of style and this is good comedy.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The writing in this show is great and the acting is superb.  I think what makes the show, however, are the guest stars that are always making an appearance
B004UPANAI|4.0|If you like Hugh Jackman you'll get to see plenty to like.  If you like comic books? the story is a fun one to watch.  If you're looking for the larger X-Men story to make sense on a timeline? Don't.  It won't all add up.  But, really, you probably won't care.  It's as fun to watch as the rest of the X-Men movies and possibly better because the story makes the most use of two excellent actors' skills.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|The season 2 was excellent. I loved the cliffangers at the end of season 2. I'm looking forward for season3.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The graphics are a little silly but it's cute. I'm sure kids would like it. I don't like it that you can't move things once they're placed. Fun.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A delightful look at the short history of the making of a theatre group and complex.<br />I enjoyed the look at the act of the true art of any great theatre--collaboration. The writing takes you into the process of production but more importantly into the group process of the workings of individuals as they learn how to ride their &#34;tricycle.&#34; I also enjoyed the look at support and influence of the community audience and the building of their loyalty to the programming. Sadly, it also tells the tale of the vulnerabilities of when individual contributions shift, but this is the oft repeated tale of the growth of every art institution. You will enjoy this read if you have loyalty to your own local theatre company be it in the USA or anywhere as the similarities are greater than the differences.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Life of Pi is difficult to follow the story. I haven't finished it for that reason<br />The two books by Catherine Hyde , I enjoyed  them, good reading
B00772M1F6|5.0|AXS TV used \\"North Side Gal\\" in their commercial advertizing the Americana Music Awards.  I was hooked in seconds!  A quick Google search was followed by a search here at Amazon.  The CD is currently playing in the player on my desk.  I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!  Roots rock at it's best.  Sounds like these guys could have been hanging out w/ Buddy Holly & Bill Haley back in the 50's.  If I was told that Chuck Berry had provided uncredited songwriting credit I wouldn't be surprised at all.  Let's all hope that JD, Jimmy and Alex will keep playing and recording for years to come.  I know I'll be buying on the release date in the future.  Now I've just got to make sure I don't miss them if & or when they play live in East Tennessee.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great story lines - fun and interesting characters - love Julianna Margulis. I Can't wait to watch the next season!
B00DCZ34CG|5.0|We watched it over and over and when any children come over the house to visit ,I play it for them and they love it. !!!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I liked this book a lot! I wasn't just glued to the pages, nor was I left amazed or blown away by the ending, but overall I did enjoy this and will read the next in the series.
B00BMNM4H6|2.0|The basic premise is neat, and the first couple levels are alright. The issue I had was when drawing lines, if they aren't perfectly straight, the sugar will pile up instead of following the path. There is also no undo or way to correct lines after you've placed them, so if you make a mistake, or your finger wobbles a little while drawing you have to start over. I got it as FAOTD so I'm not too upset, but I'd be very unhappy if I had payed money for it.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love this CD, my favorite song is #10, If I knew.  It reminds me of an old song from the olden days.  I swear this guy was born in the wrong decade.  His voice is amazing, and I love this CD.  I do recommend this CD for anybody who likes Bruno Mars.  They will love it :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was one of the best contemporary books I have read.  Edgy and suspenseful, extremely well-written.  I could not put it down.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|The Jorte Calendar is okay. The only thing I don't like is that when I delete an item, it deletes the recurring weeks also. Having to enter recurring weeks one at a time is kind of a  pain. I need to find out if I can delete just one week without affecting future &#34;recurring&#34; weeks.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|I initially viewed this movie in Blue-ray only.  Once past the comentaries of 'Globle Warming', I found it to be a wondeful experience and ride on the Colorado River.  Oh to be able to shed a half decade off of my life and to be able to ride it.  Absolutely magnificent experience with high definition surround sound!
1577314808|1.0|This book is a rip off of just about every self-help book out there on the market.  I read it and did not read anything that I did not read before.  My \\"Power of Now\\" is hanging out with wife and my two dogs and having a lot of fun with them.  I certainly did not need to waste one cent of my hard earned money to learn to do that as I borrowed it from my local library.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Neil Gaiman has given us an unusual way of experiencing what's important in the world and in life. He leaves open a great many why' s and how's. I wanted his boy to be older, and to have a name.

B005544TRQ|4.0|I am enjoying this show, it is very funny sometimes sly humor.  It is a lot like a funny law and order.

B00E6Z0THE|4.0|If you enjoy games like The Lost City and The Secret of Grisly Manor you'll like this game.  Fun puzzles but not too difficult.
B0042MDAL8|3.0|I bought this for a friend as a secret santa gift. I have seen the movie and think it's okay. She was thrilled with the gift.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|What a great color!  Case is high quality.  It has a low profile and a very reasonable price.  Highly recommend without hesitation.  Will be buying more colors myself.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I enjoyed the whole series.  This one took a little more to get through but was worth it in the end...
B0041KVZ1S|5.0|The vinyl disk is of optimum sonorous quality. Nothing to complain on the quality nor of the delivery of the product. I recommend.
B001QE9WEO|5.0|Return 2 is not going to be considered a great film by many but for me it was awesome.  I loved it when it first came out and I love it today.  It has some great make-up.  All the characters in the film are great, you like the good ones and hate the bad ones, and laugh at the funny ones.  It does well story wise I think.  The start of the film is great all the reasons for why the events happen make sense, and the middle of the film is well paced with gore, comedy, and even a bit of suspense, the ending is decent I can enjoy it for ending more or less on a good note, and not one where all is hopeless.  If you like zombies, I think you will like this one.
B00004WNHC|5.0|The vinyl disk is of optimum sonorous quality. Nothing to complain on the quality nor of the delivery of the product. I recommend.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|I just love this game.  It great and it is calming.  I like that you can change the background and colors.
B008EKAE0O|3.0|I had a problem with this product. It was with much more scratches of what the mentioned one in the announcement. However as always the Amazon it was fast efficient e to decide the problem, finally I finished staying satisfied with result.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This was a fun game with a simple concept, but I completed all of the levels in a few days. Wish there were more levels with additional challenges and variations. Sandbox mode is pretty useless, too. No cups or goals and limited control with the amount of sugar. Maybe add the color filters to the sandbox? Maybe also a &quot;fan&quot; to place on the board that can &quot;blow&quot; sugar horizontally? I don't know. This was kinda neat but I feel it needed more.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|One word, amazing. This show is incredibly amazing and well written with pretty good actors, mainly Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen. The show seems to be going in the direction that the DC Comics movies are leaning, a darker, grittier, and more realistic approach. This particularly works very well with this character and the show and really makes this a worthwhile series. You will not be disappointed with the series. Definitely would recommend this.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|cool app but crashes during set up and when settings doing changes. weather setup not quiet right just, needs a few tweeks
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it, can't wait for more! Although the ending of the season is utterly, utterly tragic, it's worth watching time and time again
B0063M22QO|5.0|This app is easy to play. It has nice graphics. I am glad i got this app.  So far solving is very easy. I hope it gets a little more challenging.
0786962984|5.0|My four nephews and one niece were home for holidays last month in August...they are between the ages of 6 and 11. They EACH have their own brand new iPod touch,newer laptops,are glued to these screens,almost never interacting with people....you get the idea. We wanted to give them gifts they'd really like, right?They were given radio controlled cars....not impressed.radio controlled helicopters? Novelty wore off after they started to crash and break in a few days. We are talking about hundreds of dollars in toys and these kids were unimpressed.(some would say they are spoiled but that's not for discussion here). I got them this game....easy instructions, they were playing in 10 minutes.THEY LOVED IT. NO IPODS THE REST OF THE NIGHT! I asked why: they said because it has adventure,group play (kids don't play together as much these days I guess), and the game is different every time, not like playing the same level of a video game over and over. I noticed they were very imaginative,fleshing out an actual story between each other,and I think that's what really made them enjoy it.<br />They loved the artwork, the pieces, the board,the box...I should have made them open this gift first!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This wAS A FUN GAME AND I PLAYED THE TRIAL VERSION AND WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT WAS OVER SO I NEED TO BUY THE FULL GAME. iTS AN EASY GAME AND FUN TO PLAY.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Great way to tell history thru fiction.  Learned a lot about the royalty history.  Would highly reccommend this to all interested in this topic
B00DJWV11I|5.0|A plot summary of this book won't suggest anything out of the ordinary; it's all about the characters and the wonderfully witty use of language.<br /><br />The book is constructed as Drew's monologue to the reader, and it is a clever device to reveal his character and to create laugh-out-loud humour. He is crude and appalling but also smart and true to his personal code of behaviour, as twisted as it may seem at times.<br /><br />Katherine is a great match for him and I believed in their HEA. It's refreshing to read a romance in which the hero is perfectly happy with his life before the heroine comes along, and yet is able to recognise and embrace the additional joy of a loving relationship.<br /><br />I was thoroughly entertained by Drew's rollercoaster of emotions, his generously offered insights into the male psyche, his hilarious descriptions of everyone around him, and his unabashed worship of the heroine.
B007N6Y4Q0|5.0|This CD is among the top three of the band and at his best too. It's an album with better instrumental arrangements more elaborate and more concise songs. This phase began on the CD \\"The Head On The Door\\" and reaches its top on this CD and also on the CD \\"Wish\\". The original disc is worth now, but the deluxe version with the second album features unreleased tracks of the season with a good repertoire and complements live. Excellent! Note 9.0.

B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This game is super addicting and great to play when you have some time to kill. Even though I got the app for free I would definitely pay for it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Its is easy to navigate with this app. I have had no trouble finding whatever I have looked from Parts of stage plays to songs from musicals.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I thought this movie was actually pretty good. Was is the best movie I've ever seen? no. But it was original with a little bit of si-fi, and I say a little because it was done...\\"tastefully\\". not that I dislike si-fi, but when i learned this movie was coming out I worried that they would over-do the si-fi aspect of the book. i think they balanced it really well--it could have easily gone Men-In-Black-ish, and no one wants that. with most movies coming out these days being about vampires, zombies, or fast and the furious 13, I thought it was kind of refreshing.<br /><br />as for the acting, it was mostly good. seems more like the awkwardness comes from the directing, the more people that were in the scene, the more awkward it got. the set was good for the most part, considering the majority of this movie took place in 1) stark cement rooms, 2) bleak desert, 3) endless cave.<br /><br />maybe i wasn't expecting too much, maybe the story distracted me from the less than great aspects of the film (i read the book about 4 years ago, just long enough to remember the jist of the story while forgetting the better details), or maybe the movie was just more good than bad. i feel like a lot of these reviews are pretty harsh (maybe because of it's twilight affiliation?).<br /><br />as a side note, my viewing of this movie coincided with my reading of the most recent Dan Brown novel, Inferno. One line struck me, \\"the humans were killing each other, and their planet.\\" if you've read that book you'll probably get a little bit of a chill too!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Works as advertised. The parts went together well. If you need instructions you won't get them. Unscrew the barrel body, put the battery in and the device is ready. No battery indicator light and I don't know the battery life.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|Movie keep skipping during the watching of this DVD. It was returned and thank you for giving credit back to account.
B0035S996U|5.0|I love the older, more simple movies. They are much more realistic. The Warriors is a classic and its as good as newer movies in this genre.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|It was very good and enjoyed it very much. The move was all that I had seen in the movies.
B00821OX98|4.0|While the premise strains credulity, the series is nevertheless very engaging, well-written and well-executed. The characters are compelling and the situations they face grab you and pull you in.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found this book to be quite intriguing. You find out the secret well before the end of the book.Without giving too much away I felt the ending of the book ended much to soon. It left me with some unanswered questions. This author has a good imagination. This book has been on the bestseller list for a number of weeks.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Extremely detailed and suspenseful. Keeps you wondering, \\"What the heck?\\"  REACHER is the ultimate badass hero. I hope he never ages out.
B002ZG9788|3.0|I bought used blueray to save money. The copy i received had &#34;Rent Copy&#34; written on it, it has tons of advertisements which you can't even skip. giving it a 3* for that<br /><br />Otherwise received product in a good condition as it was used item.
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|Mud started out very slowly. You kept waiting for some big reveal only to be let down.  Mud was literally a stick in the mud time and time again.  On a positive note, the acting was great but the plot fell short.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Don't be fooled into thinking this is one of those stupid spoof movies with lame toilet humor jokes and sub-par acting.<br /><br />This movie is a clever and hilarious spin on several horror movie tropes. This is one of those movies you can watch with *anyone* and have a good time. It is subtle and smart while still being laugh-out-loud funny. Alan Tudyk steals the show, but everyone in the cast holds their own well. This is one film I wouldn't mind seeing serialized.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Joan Crawford at her best, along with all the other great women in the cast.  The story line still holds true, too.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|The Unrated Cut runs about 7 minutes longer than the Theatrical Cut, and primarily contains additional action shots (nothing major).  Director Marc Forster has said that the Theatrical Cut IS the Director's Cut, which also unfortunately means that we will not be seeing any footage from the discarded Battle of Moscow (except for a few quick scenes in the closing montage) and the Matthew Fox subplot.<br /><br />The UNRATED Cut is the one to get!  It contains slightly more gore (but not gratuitously so) than the Theatrical Cut, and the action scenes are more fluid and less choppy.<br /><br />I've listed the primary differences between the Unrated Cut and the Theatrical Cut below.  Note, SPOILERS follow below, so read at your own risk.<br /><br />1) When zombies are shot/stabbed/curb stomped/etc.., they spew CG black blood.  When people are bitten, there's more CG red blood.<br /><br />2) During the opening scene in Philadelphia, there are more scenes of pandemonium and zombies getting shot and/or biting humans.  The segment with the red T-shirted male (\\"Here comes the Number 12 Train...\\") being bitten and transformed into a zeke is longer and more violent.<br /><br />3) At the NJ Mart, when Gerry is looking for albuterol for his daughter, the camera pans down to show a dead body lying in a pool of blood, suggesting that the pharmacy employee shot him.<br /><br />4) The chase scene from the alleyway to the apartment is longer and more harrowing.  Gerry headshots a zombie and shoots a few others, also crushing a security guard zombie with a filing cabinet.  In the theatrical cut, this zombie chase scene is instead used during the Lanes' early morning escape to the apartment's rooftop.<br /><br />5) The escape scene to the apartment rooftop is now longer and more violent.  Gerry bayonets, shoots, or rifle butts many more zombies.  In a surprising twist, Tomas saves Gerry from a zeke, rather than Gerry himself shooting the zeke in the theatrical cut.  Matthew Fox's parajumper character also shoots a few more zombies and there's more zombie blood when they're shot.<br /><br />6) When Dr. Fassbach trips and accidentally shoots himself in the head, the wound is more graphic.  Chunks of his back skull are blown into the air and gore covers the exit ramp of the C-130.  Although this description sounds graphic, the camera cuts away quickly so that only brief glimpses of gore are seen by the audience.<br /><br />7) David Morse's character graphically pulls out his last remaining tooth in the Unrated Cut.  This is not shown in the Theatrical Cut.<br /><br />8) The Battle for Jerusalem has additional action shots.  It's now a thrilling and intense sequence in the Unrated Cut!  More IDF soldiers shooting zekes, more zekes biting people, grenades blowing up zekes, etc..<br /><br />9) When Gerry cuts off Segen's hand in the Unrated Cut, we see the bloody stump as well as geysers of CG blood.  This is definitely graphic and not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />10) The zombie attack on Belarus Airways is now more intense with passengers getting bitten left and right.  There is more CG blood too, but nothing too explicit since most of the shots are very quick.<br /><br />11) Gerry takes down a few zekes in the WHO facility more graphically.  He clotheslines one zeke with a crowbar and stomps on the face of another.  More CG black blood.<br /><br />Prior to watching World War Z, I had mixed feelings about the movie based on the trailers I had seen.  Fast zombies?  Blasphemy.<br /><br />I ended up enjoying the movie, even with Damon Lindelof's rewritten third act.  The ending on a quiet, but hopeful note was a better conclusion than the rumored Battle of Moscow.  The idea of using a temporary, but curable disease as camouflage was a unique plot point.  Can't wait for the sequel, even if it has very little to do with Max Brooks' original books.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|When I saw that they had called this DVD a \\"bootleg\\" concert, I was expecting something out-of-focus and with poor sound, instead of the perfectly clear picture and sound quality it actually delivers. Even if it had been out-of-focus, I knew that, for myself at least, any film of a Springsteen concert from that point in his career would eclipse all of the best things he had ever previously released.<br /><br />Because I mean, I saw Springsteen a few times in the 70s, twice around the time of the show that is included here. For my money, this was the peak of his career, by far. For one thing, the E-st band was not intended to include girls- nothing personal, but guys sometimes feel they need to sort of watch their manners and be mature when a girl is with them, (and rock n roll has little to do with maturity). But mostly its the great material that makes this era so good, it was at a time when it seemed Bruce was re-discovering his infatuation for classic Rock n Roll, before he got into the sort of folk-country stuff he did on \\"nebraska\\" that bored me so much. Songs like \\"fire\\" and \\"the fever\\", \\"Proove it All night\\"! He never brought out a acoustic guitar back then during this tour. I saw him about 3 months before this Houston DVD concert, in New Yorks Palladium, and then a few months later -only a week after this DVD show, in Winterland, where he did a show that was almost identical to what is on this DVD. I don't know what it was that made him seem so much better back then, one thing for me that made it seem that way was the fact that so many people outside of NYC still didn't even know him yet, despite the fact that he had been on the cover of 'Time'. At winterland in SF the place was about only 3/4s full, yet he did one of the best shows that night that I have ever seen in my life, and I have seen just about everybody except the Beatles themselves. But later, when he became so damn famous, after \\"born in the USA\\"( a 1980s mainstream LP, done with the same intentions that Michael Jackson had when he recorded \\"Thriller\\" right around the same time; to become as popular as humanly possible, with everybody in the world. I HATED it) and everyone loved him, everybody... from the blue collar union workers, to the gulf war vets in a few years, with the kids who wanted to enlist, the football fans, the baseball fans, and later the friggin 911 New York Firemen- whatever! He wasnt a ROCK figure anymore, he became some sort of gung-ho all-american icon, like Rambo or something- and it even seemed he LIKED it this way. I lost interest and drifted back towards Dylan again. For me,Rock'n'Roll has always been about REBELLION,( e.g.. John lennon to an audience which included the Queen-mother, at an early Beatles concert...\\"The people in the cheap seats please clap, the rest of you rattle your f***in' jewlrey\\") and about being young and reckless, not about being patriotic. Elvis' clothes, and his sneer, The Beatles long hair and rude jokes about anybody that took themselves too seriously- especially each other-, it was all a form of rebellion. Dylan became known as a rebel in 1966 when he played folk music like Rock n roll, upsetting nearly everybody at Newport folk festeval. Bruce, after \\"Darkness\\", has been making Rock music acceptable to the mainstream, to the establishment. I preferred him when he was younger. Back in the 70s, I really believed that the 'Time' cover had embarrased him. I would have figgured also that the thought of being 'mainstream' would actually have offended him. In the 1970s, it WOULD have! It would have offended most of his fans back then also, thats for sure<br /><br />Anyways, this here DVD of this 1978 Houston show brings back the rock and roller for me. Thats what I love so much about it. He was still a kid, a kid who had been smart enough to stay the hell out of Vietnam, and a kid who seemed obsessed with giving his fans a perfect rock 'n' roll dream-show; and he came close to doing it every night back then in'78, because THAT was just about the only thing in the world that mattered to him in those days<br /><br />At that time, just after I had seen him in SF, if I could have gotten hold of a DVD like this one- despite the fact that DVDs hadnt been invented yet- I would have paid probably a thousand dollars for it- that is if I could have got my hands on that much cash back then. But I have this DVD now, thats for sure, thanks to this box-set, and it sure brings back memories of those days, and of that time- my youth. It is awesome, the DVD alone is MORE than worth the price that people are complaining about, thats how I feel about it.<br /><br />I saw him later, 1985 it was, in a huge sports stadium in Oakland; about the only type of venue that could hold him and his fans by that time ( in 1978 he had sworn never to play in anything bigger than a 3000 seat audotorium/theater, \\"There are some things you can't compromise on\\" he said, referring to his promise of never playing stadiums.) He had on his bandana and his sleeveless workshirt, showing off his newly buffed rambo-arms to millions of kids who would have never even heard of \\"Blinded By The Light\\" if it hadn't been for the Manfred Mann version, kids who got revved up because they only wanted \\"Born in the USA\\", because they thought it was about the glory of war and killing, and about how great and powerful USA was in the time of Ronald Reagan, this is how I remember it now.It almost seemed as though Bruce had tapped into, and even exploited, the current popularity of Ronald Regan, and the 'gung-ho' spirit of the times, in order to become really huge. IAnd if he wasn't going on with new \\"raps\\" about the vietnam vet, it was the laid-off factory worker, or the Farmers, the dispossesed. Springsteens music never created the chemicle reaction that, for instance, The Beatles did, who conqured the nation the first time \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand' was played on the radio pretty much.( It has always seemed suspicious to me that Bruce rarely mentions them, not in any interviews I have read. These four guys who changed his life so much. But The beatles, more than anybody else in popular culture, had a grudge about the establishment- at least lennon did. I have heard Bruce talk about Dylan, the Animals, Creedence,the Stones, just about everybody else, but the name Lennon never comes out of his mouth) Not until he came out with 'Born In The USA' did he get a reaction like that. It was, I feel, this IMAGE that sold him in 1984, not so much the music. The music alone, and the real guy, always attracted a 'cult' following of loyalists, connissures if you will. I think he knows this, and I think he is(deep down) embarrased by parts of the 1984 album, and the reason I say this is because I feel in the 70s he was proud of the relatively smaller 'cult' following of discriminating rock music fans that he had then, and he was proud about only playing the smaller auditoriums. Springsteen had never been a Vietnam vet,a factory worker, or anything but a rock musician, a really great one. Like most of us, it was his dream as a teenager to ESCAPE becoming any of those things, and he achieved his dream, THATS what I want him to write about! I, for one, don't want to hear about workers, or the disposessed, I run into them every day.People listen to Rock because it makes them feel like dancing, it gets them excited. Songs like \\"The Fever\\", or \\"Fire\\" those were REAL, his real experience. But not one single song from 'Nebraska' was anything but pretense. And this, I feel, is Jon Landau territory.<br /><br />'Tunnel Of Love', that was real, a great LP, the greatest Rock album from the '80s, about Bruces real life and experience, and it was alive, I could relate with the songs- me, a guy who never in my life would ever do to any audience the things that Bruce could do, but I could relate with a guy like him about how relationships can make you feel here on this album- and most other people could as well. And peoplewho live the types of lives Bruce sings about on in the songs 'The River\\" or 'Downboand Train'- they don't want to hear those two songs, they want excitement when they put music on.  They want Rock n Roll, and to tear up seats,or to dance. But it wasn't long before Bruce was back with 'Ghost of Tom Joad' again.<br /><br />I remember they had those big jumbo screens at every show by the time of that 1984 tour. I used to wonder where had the cameras been back in 1978? I had figured that NONE of those \\"Darkness\\" shows had been captured on film, while the \\"born in the USA\\" concerts would ALL be video-taped, it didn't seem right.It wasn't right, not completely. It turns out that a couple shows were captured on tape back in '78 as well<br />So at least we can see 1978 again now, finally. What took so friggin long?? thats what I would like to know. But yes, at least ONE of those shows was indeed filmed, all three wonderful hours of it, including all the encores, and is now safely on my shelf, along with my other most prized memories.<br />And if you already have the concert footage that came with the \\"Born To Run\\" box set, the 1975 London concert, this 1978 \\"Darkness\\" concert is about five times as good, at least in my opinion it is. The second song of this show, \\"Streets of Fire\\" ALONE is more powerfull than that entire London show. The only way the DVD of this 'Darkness' show could be topped, for me, would be if somebody someday discovers that a film of the Beatles had been made, before they became so famous, back when they used to play eight hours a night in The Top Ten or Star Club on the Reeperbahn in Hamburg- and somebody releases THAT! Mak-Shau!!<br /><br />As for the songs, the before-now unreleased 2 CD collection of outtakes from 1977-'78, for my money this is the best music of the Bosses long career. I remember too, I once subscribed to an early \\"fanzine\\" called 'Thunder Road', that ran interviews with E-st Band members. I think it was Miami Steve Van Zandt whospoke about a unreleased \\"party album\\" that was done at the same time as \\"darkness\\", an album he said would hopefully soon be released, an album that had songs that Bruce was currently performing on the road, songs like \\"Fire\\", \\"Because The Night\\" , and I thought \\"The Fever\\" was from this album, but I later found out it had been recorded earlier, probably during \\"Born to Run\\", but Bruce had begun doing it live during the 'Darkness' tour also. I had always wanted this album to come out. By the time \\"Nebraska\\" came out a couple years later, it seemed apparant Bruce had abandoned that plan, and he had also stopped listening to Miami Steve in favor of Jon Landau, who knew nothing at all in my opinion. He belonged better with Jackson Brown, who he worked with also. Miami Steve grew frustrated- I don't blame him- and by the time \\"born in the USA\\" came out, Steve was gone. He never said it had to do with Landau, but it sure seemed like it. How is a guy who knows all about music, and who has helped guide Bruce's own musical tastes so well, how is he going to sit still while some \\"intellectual\\" music critic who can't play a note of anything stands around and fills Bruces head with talk of 'symbolism', 'The Grapes of friggin Wrath', 'Charels Starkweather' (or whatever that idiots name was), and a bunch of other pretentious B.S.??I felt Bruce began losing touch, but losing Miami Steve was the worst thing that happened to Bruce- so was the addition of the girl in the band for the \\"Born in The USA\\" tour. But anyway, I degress.<br /><br />Thank God that this double CD came out, and we can finally hear the E-st Band in the studio sounding exactly as they should sound like- the finest Rock n Roll outfit since Steve Cropper, Booker T, the Mar-Keys, and the rest of the Stax musicians. The problem with this CD is the order of the songs the way they released it. This is not a single-unit double album, it is TWO vastly different single albums,each with a sound and theme of its own, andto really be enjoyed needs to be listened to in this way, along with the appropriate songs from the \\"Tracks\\" collection that were recorded during the \\"Darkness\\" sessions. This is how it SHOULD be heard, in my opinion:<br /><br />album one:<br /><br />Hearts Of Stone - from 'Tracks'<br />Talk To Me<br />Don't Look Back - 'Tracks'<br />Rendezvous<br />Candy's Boy<br />The Fever - \\"Tracks\\"- (the only song not from the Darkness sessions)<br />Fire<br />Come On (Let's Go Tonight)<br />Because The Night<br />Ricky Wants A Man Of Her Own -'Tracks\\"<br />The Promise<br />City Of Night<br />The Way You Belong To Me<br /><br />Album 2:<br /><br />Racing in The Streets- (slightly different version)<br />Gotta Get That Feeling<br />Outside Looking In<br />Someday<br />One Way Street<br />Wrong Side Of The Street<br />The Brokenhearted<br />Great Big Kiss (Tracks)<br />The Iceman (Tracks)<br />Save My Love<br />Ain't Good Enough For You<br />Spanish Eyes<br />It's A Shame<br />The Little Things<br />Breakaway<br /><br />Taken in this order, these songs make TWO incredible Bruce Springsteen & The E-St Band albums, albums that can easially stand beside his first three, and \\"Darkness\\" afterwards as well. The only thing missing is the photos and artwork that would have gone on a record sleeve<br /><br />Looking back to that time, the late 1970s, a time when the two most significant types of \\"rock\\" were either disco or \\"new wave\\" (punk),( one music seemed real and significant, the other seemed created by the establishment to cash-in on) it was appropriate that two of these recordings were covered by new artists. \\"Because the night\\" and \\"Fire\\", by new wave artists Patti Smith and Robert Gordon. If you wanted recordings of these songs, you had to get these versions, and they were both great. Soon afterwards though, the Pointer Sisters ruined any chances of Robert Gordons new wave-rockabilly version of \\"fire\\" being a hit by recording it in a AM radio disco-type version. Bruce had introduced the song live in sept. '78 by promoting the Robert Gordon- Link Wray version, but by December he was calling it a Pointer Sister record. That sticks with me<br /><br />I mean, it is my personal feeling that these two albums are Bruce Springsteens absolute finest. Can you imagine if he had put out the both in 1978, along with \\"Darkness in the Edge Of Town\\" as well??! He very well could have. \\"Darkness\\" didn't sell all that well I remember, but I bet the first of these two albums would have, I bet it would have gone to #1, and could have had at least 4 hit singles ('Talk To Me', 'Fire', 'Because The Night', 'Rendezvous', and ALSO 'The Way' or 'Don't Look Back'- FIVE or SIX hits!).And the second album shows us the type of music Bruce loved as a teenager in his first band, The Castilles. Not only is this awesome Rock music, this is important, it is important to Bruce and it is important to those of us who followed him before it was fashionable, the people who were drawn to his music from the first time we heard it. It helps people to understand what is so magic about Springsteen by showing us the magic that he himself was drawn to in the first place himself. But Bruce and Jon Landau wanted to go with \\"Darkness\\". Thats fine, but why did he also have to make us wait so long, why couldn't he have also put out the album I like to call \\"Because The Night\\" in 1978 as well? I remember, in the 90s, he put out two albums in the same day, and neither of them were all that good, and they really wern't very different from one another. He could have put out 3 CLASSICS all in the same day back in '78. He could have put 'Because The Night' out in '77. \\"Darkness' came out in '78, three years after 'Born To Run', his last album before that. Three years was a lifetime to wait in the '70s for an artist to release his next album. But these were the types of decisions Springsteen began making after hiring his new manager/coproducer. Can you just imagine Brian Epstein coproducing the Beatles, or even asking to? Can you imagine Albert Grossman giving Dylan musical suggestions?- If he had even tried to, the next time he wanted to see Dylan he would have to stand in line and buy tickets, like anybody else. But it was perfectly alright for this music critic, Jon Landau, to walk in and immeadiately start offering suggestions on how Bruce should sound. And before you knew it, Miami Steve was gone, and we had 'Nebraska', and then Bruce was putting out a live album that had songs edited. Next after that the E-st band was being replaced by a synthasizer, and told they should accept other offers. But not Jon Landau, nosir. Not the original 'Yes-man' who has encouraged Springsteen in every compromise that he has ever made, and who has never made a dissenting comment to him about any thought that has come out of the Bosses mouth. He has just made them about people who did have the guts to do it, thats all- people like Van Zandt. It was yes-men like Landau whom Elvis surrounded himself with also, and just look what happened to the Kings music after he got back from the Army

B001NLKZUA|5.0|I couldnt put this book down. I love the series as a whole, but so far I would say this book is my favorite of them all.
B00CISAPJS|3.0|What a well rounded movie that requires minimal thinking and processing. Better than mowing the grass, that's what I was supposed to be doing when I rented this. I should have mowed the grass and waited for this to come out on PBS.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|I've recently become interested in human history after reading &#34;A Brief History of Humanity&#34; by  Yuval Noah Harari (unfortunately currently only available in Hebrew). Having heard good things about &#34;Guns, Germs and Steel&#34; I was keen read it.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed! The book is well written and the author obviously knows his subject matter inside out. The level of technical detail is impressive, although it can get a bit much sometimes (I skimmed over some bits, which is just fine with me).<br />Some of the authors arguments feel a bit flimsy and less backed by technical detail than others (e.g. the importance of the east-west axis of Europe compared to the north south axis of America), but even those arguments sound pretty plausible to a non-expert like myself.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in human history.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|A fine collection of metal gear games that bring back nostalgia of my years spent hunkered down in a dark room playing Snake. Love it.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|That is all that needs to be said.<br />I resent having to fill a page with drivel! Adult and thoughtful
034580404X|5.0|Steamy, great &#34;beach&#34; read! Ending of 3rd book a little predictable, but definitely one that you couldn't put down! (All 3 in fact!)
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|A really fun game for the whole family. Great for when you have nothing to do and just want to relax.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|easy to  use battery tracker.  Works seamlessly with the kindle fire hd I have.  I recommend this app for use.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I am enjoying the development of the characters.  Although at some points I'm a little bored (mostly during the constant description of Jace's features almost every time he comes on the scene), I am enjoying the twists Ms. Clare is making.  I even find myself sometimes feeling bad for the villain.  I'm not jumping to the next books, but I will read it to see what happens.
B00942Y4IY|4.0|Second time I've viewed this movie, and I still like the blend of Si-Fi and archeology. Acting is OK, and story line predictable but still good entertainment for an evening.
B0076DELIG|4.0|If you have enjoyed previous Michael Connelly Bosch novels, you're not going to have a problem with The Black Box.  One does get the sense, however, the Bosch is moving ever closer to the end of the line with the LAPD.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|As far as sequels go they usually only touch briefly on the previous story. BDS II, actually went back through history to give you a reason as too why and who the brothers father was(Billy Connelly). It filled in gaps in the story line also. Enjoyed it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Bought the set so that I would never again experience a &#34;Red Wedding&#34; moment.  Glad I did.  I am much better prepared for the return of &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; on HBO.  I can't wait for the next book and I can't wait to see how HBO translates the remainder of these books to the small screen.

B000JML7EC|5.0|One of my favorites always have loved its classic history. Love the adventure and the premiss. Makes me think I was born a few hundred years too late.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|Having also read Son of a Serial Killer by the same author I was immediately impressed by the diverse nature of the material he can write. In contrast to the cold-blooded narrative of the previous book, this tale is moving and tender from the first page.<br />The reader immediately recognises the signs of the impending tragedy and this story is about how the individual members of the family learn to deal with their feelings of guilt and anger which follow their loss.<br />Each character is dealt with sensitively and realistically as they find their own way forward into a bleaker future. The mother descends into alcoholism and abandons her responsibility towards the daughter she holds responsible for the tragic accident.<br />Michelle is fortunate, she is able to turn her life around and seeks a new life in America. Her younger sister Amanda, twin of the victim of the tragedy, is not so fortunate. Getting a taste for alcohol and drugs, Amanda's life spirals into a pit of iniquity as she struggles to retain any dignity amongst the men who battle to dominate her existence.<br />Eventually, finding genuine thoughtfulness in the arms of John, Amanda finds some hope. Without wanting to spoil the ending, the remainder of Amanda's journey is a poignant view of this young girl's life.<br />This is a tale which shows hope will always find a way to touch even the bleakest of lives.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Excellent writing. Very shrewd observation of characters. It's not life as we would like it but it's life as it is. Black humour softens the realisation.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|I terms of the cover I think the photoshop guy behind it did not take into consideration the height of these actors, they literally look place together, me no likey. The menu is horrible, I do not understand why TBBT would use this company again for their menu. It is the cover picture and that's it, Oh, except extremely blurry. I do, however, like that every disk has its own mini bonus features and they are pretty interesting bonus features. This was one of my least favorite TBBT seasons, but for some reason watching it with out commercials makes it more enjoyable. If you are a Big Bang Theory fan you might as well get this one as well. If your not get season one first then decide. Worth getting if your a fan of the show.
B009M2T7K6|5.0|My daughter LOVES this barbie.  It doesn't take much to change the color on this one.  It seems really well made.  She has had many hours of fun with this one.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is one of my all  time favorite games on the Kindle Fire. Never crashes, challenges kids, and great for the mom or dad who sits and waits at after school activities!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game it is really fun I mean you get confused at first but when you get used to it it is like really addicting I like love this game I suggest this game to everyone that loves taking care of animals or just loves horses
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful story line, great characters, wardrobe is fabulous, I love it.  Started watching in middle of 2nd season.  Now I'm hooked, I am totally ready for the new season.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great product to synchronize across multiple devices for projects, meeting notes and reminders. Very user friendly and intuitive for new users.
B00DJYKFXG|2.0|I purchased this for the DVD of the New Years Eve show. I was in the first row and thought there was a good possibility I would see myself at 16 years old. If not I would have the show on DVD. When I opened the box and put on the DVD it was not the footage I was lead to believe I was buying but the original CD with still photo's of the band. I purchased the record when it came out in 1972  and the CD years later. A few years back I purchased the CD again when the Dylan songs were added.  It was a great show in fact all four shows are great but if you think you are getting the Band DVD and going to see them actually doing the songs you are mistaken. It is a shame and I think this was wrongfully advertised by the record company and Robbie.
1419705644|2.0|No new information as far as I found. The art was interesting, the writing style was annoying and repetitive, I'd rather read a Wikipedia though.
B000002AH7|5.0|Miles & Evans paint life as I've experienced it. I listen and grow with every spin:  Sketches of Spain, for me, is the gratest Orchestral accomplishment of the second half of the 20th century
B002X3V4P2|4.0|A little bit of everything in this collection, but for the most part - relaxing music....and the very sad, &#34;Only Time&#34; that became a song identified with the loss of people in 9/11.
B0000046JP|5.0|The arrangement to feature guitars is a surprising, gentle contrast to the Miles Davis/Gil Evans portrait of the agony of life and the thill of a courageous beast's death for a perverse humanity
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It was interesting because I did not know the story behind the hostages situation in Iran - let alone the rescue effort!
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Great stories, costumes, acting, and sceneries. One of the best series I've ever seen. I can hardly wait until January for season 4 to begin. This is a DVD set I would watch over and over again. I bought the Blue-Ray and the quality of the picture is spectacular!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|n analytical review of The Hunger Games?...I can not believe I am doing this. \\"Why?\\" you say. Well for starters I re-read The Hunger Games because it was a part of my class readings. I know how awesome is that? Greatest class in the world! But, you can analyze the crap out of this book. I'm pretty sure we kept finding out new things about The Hunger Games every single class. Every. Single. Class. So, if I end up missing something please forgive me. I actually wrote a three page paper on it. It was pretty awesome. Now, this review isn't going to be anything special...hell its probably going to be long enough that I'm not going to review it. Sorry, but it is what it is and I hope that you come to see the similarities and references that I saw.<br /><br />In The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins creates a culture that emphasizes the diseased and negative aspects of our current culture by making references to not only our present, but our past. She depicts our obsession with fashion and popular culture through the capital, and our love for \\"real\\" fighting through The Hunger Games themselves. The Hunger Games allude to both our past and our present. It reflects out love of live fights but incorporates it with our past; mainly, the Hunger Games alludes to the original Olympics, the time of the Gladiators, and the time of Greek and Roman culture.<br />Instead of grown men fighting for a way to pay their debts or attempting to remove the shackles of slavery we are introduces to a world were children fight to the death for glory or survival. But, its not them who owes a debt; it's the whole of Panem. Who do they owe the debt to? A dictator...the capital and specifically President Snow. And here is where more greek and roman mythology comes into the story. The children becomes sacrifices...but there is no mention of gods in this story. So the government/ President Snow becomes the god. The sacrifice of children (the innocent) are being made to him and the capital. President Snow isn't the only god that the children should be afraid of. The majority of the novel takes place in a world inside of a world. Specifically the arena. In there the children are led to believe that they have control over their fate (the strongest will survive), but they don't. They aren't in charge of their world. Their world is manipulated by the Game Makers through the use of fire balls, and the ability to give and take water; they have becomes the gods of their world.<br />Then there is Katniss herself. She can be seen as the goddess Artemis. While relating to Artemis mainly through her hunting skills with a bow and arrow Katniss also finds herself more comfortable in the wilderness, at ease with the animals, a protector of young girls (all things Artemis is goddess of). Oh and did I mention Artemis is mainly depicted with a braid? Usually rolled up into a bun, but still...you can see the similarities right?<br />Not enough?<br />How about we get back to the sacrifice thing? Alright...during the time when Greek and Roman culture was at its peek a simply offence like stealing could land you the death penality; however, the least severe punishment was the loss of a limb. Can you see where I am going? Katniss and Peeta stole something from the gods/the Game Makers. They stole power. The beat them at their own game...so their punishment? A loss of limb. Now, of course, Katniss is the main character of our book and couldn't very well be punished like that...but Peeta? The truly innocent person of the two paid the price and lost his leg.<br />And, what I think is the cherry on top, the beasts at the end of the games. They were creatures created by the gods/Game makers to do their bidding...but, their partially human. In Greek mythology(maybe Roman. I can't recall 100%) the gods were famous for manipulating humans. The story of the minotaur comes to mind. The minotaur is half-human half bull created when the gods cast a spell on a queen as revenge and made her fall in lovewith a bull. The creature was later placed in the labyrinth to kill anyhow who believed they could make it through safely.<br />That's enough about Greek and Roman culture lets look at the capital, which is a reference to our culture state of culture.. The capital is filled with people wanting to be individuals, but ending up all being the same. They are greedy, frivolous, and materialistic. They wish for the best of the best, and from what we read, barely have to do anything to get it. They see others suffering and the deaths of others as entertainment. They like their mahogany, their different wigs daily, their brights colours, their silver handles, and the best food money can buy. But, the biggest connection I saw is how they WORSHIP the winners and the tributes. The tributes and, more specifically, the winners become celebrities. People begin to wear their hair like Katniss'. They wish to follow their every move and can't get enough of the star-crossed lovers of District 12. Collins reflects on our society's need to know about celebrities and almost become them or feel like they are apart of our lives.<br />Now, lets look more specifically at Katniss. Katniss can be analyzed for quite sometime, but I'll shorten it up for you. Katniss is de-feminized in the book. This is done to help bridge the gap to other readers (of the male variety). She is also the `adult' in her family and has been for some time....this too bridges the gap to older audiences. Then there is the fact that she becomes emotionless and seen more as intellectual...to a fault. I'm not sure if this reflects on our society...it probably does. I mean more people care about their technology and becoming more powerful these days than they do about the innocent people who lose their jobs and have to go to a soup kitchen daily. Or how about even just the children of third world countries? Anyhow, Katniss is against the games and the worship of the winner, but when it comes down to it she manipulates anyone and anything to become a winner (don't get me wrong after she becomes friends with Rue she does start to become more emotional), but after the games she becomes the very thing she hates: she becomes a celebrity. She plays nice for the cameras to survive and to keep those she loves alive, even though her actions bring other innocence into harms way. She is, after all, the catalyst for what happens in the second novel. Katniss is so messed up shes doesn't believe in kindness. She believes in the greediness and selfishness of society to the point where she cannot recognize, nor determine, Peeta's kindness. She thinks everything he does is strategy. She even sees Gale as a friend, but as a great hunting party who aids in her hunting and she in his. They are mutually beneficial to each other.<br />I'm not bashing on Katniss, because even though she is abrasive I still actually like her. See Katniss also represents the part of our society were kids have to grow up sooner than they should. Katniss barely ever had a childhood, she was always the adult, and the entire time she is doing what she thinks is best for herself and her more importantly...her family. In fact is should be noted and really observed that they a CHILDREN going into the games. Even though the hack each others heads off and set traps they are all children...even Cato recognizes that at the end. So why children? Well...if you are a parent or were or might be what would be your biggest fear? What would you do anything for? You kids, right? So if the government told you to do what they say...to comply or your kids will be sacrificed you would probably do it. They story wouldn't have the same ring to it if it were adults, the story plays on a parent's greatest fear...maybe even society's greatest fear in general: the sacrifice of innocence and our youth. Its something that happens every day. Kids have sex young, have babies, and even join gangs, instead of going to concerts, hanging with their friends, or, god forbid, doing their homework.<br />Now, lets look at Panem as a whole. We are informed that Panem is the remains of North America. Panam is....the world in this book. But, do we ever hear about the actual rest of the world? Nope. Wanna know why? Because we North Americans generally believe that the world revolves around us. Some of us think that North America is the world. We have fortune 500 companies, the majority of billionaires, and the largest imports and exports. Sadly, we have a pretty big say in the politics of the world. Sorry if people disagree with me, and I'm not saying I'm right... I'm just saying the novel plays on that idea of our society.<br />To be honest out of this entire novel the most unrealistic thing, to me, is Peeta. How does someone like him even get created in a world like this? He's parents are awful (specifically his mom, but I don't exactly see his dad doing anything for him either), he's not poor but not rich, his brothers obviously don't love him enough to sacrifice themselves for him, and the girl he loves never really knew his name, and is using him. Oh, and he looses a leg! The fact that he gets out of bed every day a nice guy seriously amazes me. Maybe his mother inadvertently humble him while beating him with burnt bread?<br />And how about Haymitch...he's a drunk. That is the cure for PTSD apparently. Did you know that in the last decade the government, in both Canada and the U.S, wanted to cut back on the treatment offers for not only soldiers, but other suffering from mental disorders? Now, I'm not saying that the book references that the government doesn't care about it soldiers, but many people don't understand how to cope with things like that and simple turn to drinking. It also references substance abuse in general.<br />Some other quick things:<br />There are districts= the seperation of the masses to prevent uprising<br />There is a clear definition of hierarchy, and the rich and the poor. Simply being born into a richer district gives you better odds<br />Oh...and the whole \\"May the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor\\"... obviously everyone gets thats a big joke, because the odds are actually against them.<br />Genetic manipulation=<br /><br />On a lighter note: this book rocks my world. There is adventure, romance, suspense, and a cliff-hanger of sorts. It blows my mind away how it can be read simply as an adventure, but can also be dissected down to its word usage.<br /><br />There is so much more, but my brain currently hurts just thinking about it, and I can't exactly copy and past my essay here...my University would not like that. But for those of you that always said you don't like The Hunger Games you should re-read it with the idea of dissecting it and I bet you'd be amazed at what you find. I'm not saying you'll enjoy it because its just not for some people, and I'm not saying shame on your for not liking it because...really, what business is it of mine? And, to each their own! I'm just happy that you're reading in general lol.<br /><br />If there is anything else that you can think of please feel free to comment or shoot me an email...I would love discussing this book (or others) with other people.<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />The story line-- It hits on our corrupt and diseased society that is obsessed with TV, `real' fighting, and the lives of celebrities.<br /><br />The characters--they are extremely well crafted<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />I honestly cannot think of anything.<br /><br />Overall (Writing style, story line, and general):<br /><br />Overall I think its a brilliant read whether your reading it for the adventure, the romance, or for school. I loved the constantly moving plot. I love the difficult to understand Katniss, the can't help but fall in love with Peeta, and the unforgetable (and we feel sorry for him) Gale. I found it extremely easy to follow and I had no difficulties remembering people or recalling information previously given at the beginning of thebook. And yes I'll admit it I loved the rush that you get when reading about the deaths and the games!<br /><br />And dear lord how I am in love with The Boy With the Bread.<br /><br />In relation to the movie:<br /><br />Many people said they didn't like the movie. Hey to each their own. I personally loved it. I found that it followed the book pretty well. Now it wasn't perfect...sorry but fitting two weeks prior to the games and the two-three weeks of the games in a two hour movie just can't happen. Did I miss the connection that you could really feel in the book between Katniss and Peeta? Ya I did. But, hey I could still feel it in the movie too, just not as big. Cato was pretty devious in the movie just like in the book, same with Clove and Glimmer. I will tell you the one things I really missed:<br />Right after the announcement about their being allowed two victors Katniss says Peeta's name. In the book she shouts it. When I read that part...I cried. It added to their whole star-crossed lovers thing, but in the movie it wasn't loud enough for me. I wanted her to shout it and then be afraid that she was too loud.<br />Oh an I expected Peeta to be ripped. Like Kellan Lutz or something., god forbid, doing their homework.<br />Now, lets look at Panem as a whole. We are informed that Panem is the remains of North America. Panam is....the world in this book. But, do we ever hear about the actual rest of the world? Nope. Wanna know why? Because we North Americans generally believe that the world revolves around us. Some of us think that North America is the world. We have fortune 500 companies, the majority of billionaires, and the largest imports and exports. Sadly, we have a pretty big say in the politics of the world. Sorry if people disagree with me, and I'm not saying I'm right... I'm just saying the novel plays on that idea of our society.<br />To be honest out of this entire novel the most unrealistic thing, to me, is Peeta. How does someone like him even get created in a world like this? He's parents are awful (specifically his mom, but I don't exactly see his dad doing anything for him either), he's not poor but not rich, his brothers obviously don't love him enough to sacrifice themselves for him, and the girl he loves never really knew his name, and is using him. Oh, and he looses a leg! The fact that he gets out of bed every day a nice guy seriously amazes me. Maybe his mother inadvertently humble him while beating him with burnt bread?<br />And how about Haymitch...he's a drunk. That is the cure for PTSD apparently.

B00AA03D18|5.0|WELL HERE IT IS. INTERESTING,THOUGHT PROVOKING, INFORMATIVE AND SOMEWHAT SURPRISING. WELL WRITTEN EVEN IF ALEXANDER IS JUST A SURGEON, HE'S DONE A FINE JOB ON THIS BOOK.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I still play it and dance around the house.  Reminds me of the 70s and California before I moved to Florida.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|Stuck in a dialogue screen so now I can't go any further in the game.  I h ave no idea how to hard close<br />it and restart.
1400049628|3.0|Didn't agree with some of the items in the book but it was fun to share with my son. Thanks
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I have the paid version of this app (I'm not sure there is a free version) and the latest update added a timed commercial that plays everytime you opening the game. Not what I paid for and not what my four-year old wants to sit through.<br /><br />Also, the update failed to fix the bugs in the app. Guess trying to squeeze more money out everything was more important than fixing their app.
0345803485|3.0|I'm finally getting on the 50 Shades bandwagon and started this book.  I'm a \\"chick lit\\" reader but have never gotten into erotica.  Now I know why.  This book is a bit much and the Christian Grey character tends to gross me out, quite frankly.  I'm going to finish it but can honestly say I'll probably not read another in this series.  It's just not my thing...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game every room was a different challenge. I can nnot wait for more rooms to get through.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio played the part well as the Great Gatsby...my father and mother loved this movie. The filming locations and cast were great!
B008XKSW7M|1.0|If you're looking for a funny lighthearted movie - this is not the one. Storyline is flat. Only one of the couples is funny. The others are sad or just boring. There are plenty of other movies to pick from - don't pick this one.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|There was a sense of authenticity to this book. I finished it feeling like I had an accurate image to hold in my head.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Excellent game play all the time hours of enjoyment  I would highly recommend this game to all my friend and family
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I can't really add to what other reviewers have stated. you either love it or hate it, depending on if you like this re-inventing of the franchise.<br /><br />I would like to say though that Amazon dropped the ball on delivery. it was supposed to be delivered when it was released on the 10th (a hype for pre-ordering) but didn't arrive till the 17th, a week late. On top of this I have prime, so it should of at worst been a couple days late (2 day shipping anyone?). Very annoying but does not detract from the movie itself so left it at 5 stars
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I keep coming back to play this game today, very addicting. I am an occasional angry birds player.  This star wars edition is a lot more fun, with new characters and interesting special features.  There are secret levels to unlock and each character unlocks their own level once they have scored points.  Playing on the dark side is fun twist. Maybe it is growing up with the star wars movies that makes it a reminder of childhood fun.  Great graphics and sound effects!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Sad to see Brad Pitt in a \\"B\\" rated movie -<br />details were so bad, even a child was commenting<br />on what was right!  Zombies, bad writing, bad<br />acting, totally wrong effects - what a waste of<br />time.  I am so glad that I did not go to the<br />theater to see this - but then I might have<br />gotten my money back - I would have walked out.<br />Really really bad
0345529057|4.0|books are a cheap paper back but what can you expect from such a cheap deal.  I would say this purchase is definitely worth the money and would recommend it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Never been a big reader, not until \\"50\\" came along. Friends told me I had to read these books and they were right! Pulls you right in with a terrific story and fascinating characters. A must read!
B004EPZ034|5.0|It is a great movie to watch with the kids during family night or a rainy day- whatever the case its so cute!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Thanks for getting this cd to me in a timely way and the cd sounds greats thanks again for the cd
B00DD1X99C|5.0|I've been an Elvis Fan and music collector nearly all my life, This is a great album the 180 gram vinyl pressing is EXCELLENT!<br />I'm really enjoying these reissues on the heavy vinyl it's like listening to these GREAT recordings for the first time.<br />This is especially good with all the alternate takes of these legendary songs, the album cover and artwork is very unique as well. Elvis Fans won't be disappointed with this double LP !!!
B004LWZWE2|5.0|This is such a great dvd bon scott really is the best and it's about tiime this dvd came out
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|I downloaded this on the strength of Safe and Sound and I wasn't disappointed at all, this is my favourite album of the year so far and oh boy what an album!, clearly developed with a love of 80's pop gold and none the worse for it - 80's by nature but bang up to date, infectious, melodic pop at it's finest!<br /><br />Get it, listen to it, love it & spread the word Capital Cities deserve it.
B0012NVGHU|4.0|This pseudo-musical will likely be enjoyed by most music fans.  My girlfriend loves the duet, while I love the studio song.
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|It is a great interpretation of what a vampire is. It was definitely worth the money. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of vampires.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|All the characters in this film did an excellent job. Keeps your attention, good enough to watch 2x. Good movie for magic lovers.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Do not download this app. I will be deleting. I guess it's suppose to be a instructional guide. I'm really not sure. It doesn't really help.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I haven't started reading yet so I don't know how good it wil be but I think I will like it
B0012GTZC0|4.0|What a thriller!!  It was full of excitment and fast paced reading.  Would recommend this book who enjoy mystery and intrigue.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|So far Google has dropped the ball on this one. I love my selection of Netflix, Play Movies, YouTube, and Play Music. That is an unbelievable selection there.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The bottom line is that you cannot mirror the screen of your phone with chromecast. Seems like a pretty standard and useful capability that has been left out.  Although they are promising more capabilities this device will only deliver internet content and your mobile device only serves as a remote to that content.  Dissapointing, two stars.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I have not seen this movie in the theater. It was really good and the color was fantastic.  I saw it and then I gave it to my grandson. Thank you.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I didn't think it was great but it wasnt horrible.  I think it'd not really for people who tend to sllep in otherwise just get a regular alarm clock
B0000024YL|5.0|I love it.  The sound of the cd is great.  One of my favorite groups of all time. Thank you so much for the memories.
0694003611|5.0|Got itt just in time for my new granddaughter.  Really like the thick small pages as they are very child friendly.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|love it. I have this game on all my devices and I play it every chance I get. even at work.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I found this to be absolutely the most frustrating app. I could not get this to work at all on my Kindle. Some of my friends tried to get it to work but to no avail. I HATE IT!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Wow what an awsome game it's great to compete with friends on Facebook for the highest score.I promise once you download it you will play it over and over. Great game 4 out of 5 awsome :)
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I haven't really used it yet, but I gave it several trial runs and it  seemed to work good. So if I miss an appt. I will let you know.
B004UPAN6W|3.0|but not for what amazon wants to rent it. crazy high prices on movies i can rent down the street in the 2 for a dollar section or blueray for $1.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|If you wanted to know the non-news side of the story, this is a great book to pick up and read.  Also gives you insight to a highly dedicated and highly known (now) team.  Thank you to all of our service members for their sacrifices.
6305622914|5.0|I'd recommend it to anyone but 'specially those having marital problems as in trying to keep up with each other and the neighbours
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book had me hooked after the first few chapters.  Sometimes I just start reading and many hours pass without the thought of time.  Great story where you can connect and empathize with the characters.  Highly suggested read.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|A very engaging, can't put down book. She tells it like it was and owns up to her past. Filled with great stories and anecdotes.
B00846REIS|5.0|Have been looking through books for weeks to find something to read. I came across this one and decided to give it a try......I'M VERY GLAD I DID!!!!! Now for the next one.
140006922X|5.0|Traditional Christians won't be delighted with this book, but those who are interested in the history of Christianity and its origins will find this fascinating and very informative. The author digs deep into all sides of the issue of Jesus' actual life: What did he actually do; why did he do things the way he did; how did his actions get reformulated by the Church as it evolved in the first couple of hundred years after Jesus' death and expanded beyond the Jewish culture.<br /><br />His insights are light a series of lights turning on in your head. Best of all, the book is not aimed at religiious scholars, but is written for the average reader who is familiar with the New Testament stories of Jesus --, so, former Catholic-school students in particular with relate to this book.<br /><br />I really got a lot out of this book. (I am a fallen-away Catholic, if that helps set context for this review, but I have always been interested in history.)
B002BVQU5A|4.0|Super fun! Mary Stuart is an adept actress at playing a mentally challenged teen! Very believable and enjoyable romance. Both characters are funny and great in their parts!
B00CLOTNLK|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  It has everything that I want in a prog album, from excellent musicianship to fantastic themes and lyrics.  If you love progressive rock, this is a definite buy.  Standout tracks are Pale Blue Dot, Beyond Illumination, and Closer to You, but you really need to listen to this straight through for the full effect.  I hope this band can keep producing more albums like this one.
B00A7L00XE|5.0|I had watched the &#34;Making Of&#34; this, and found an overwhelming desire to find and buy the CD after 15 minutes into the documentary. Watch it if you can, but the CD I bought is fantastic! Slow and low like amazing southern BBQ, and you will find Ben Harper to be very strong yet subtle in this 40 minute recording w/ Charlie Musselwhite. I've been looking for Ben Harper to come out with something new, and found this to be a great collaboration, and well worth the wait.
B00DJLLO0M|3.0|Having experienced some good tunes but a noticeable drop in consistency on their third album (and also Aviv's underwhelming solo project), I was prepared to be indifferent to this.  Early reviews seemed to confirm.  However, I'm actually liking this quite a bit more than Welcome To My DNA after 4-5 listens.  The songs are very succinct with little fat or padding.  Where Steven Wilson participates, his vocal textures and guitars help quite a bit, but I also absolutely love Brett Anderson's guest vocal.  I'm not sure Blackfield has a long life ahead since so many fans came to the project to get a fix of Steven Wilson's shorter, Stupid Dream-type songwriting.  That said, Blackfield was always more about Steven's arrangements of Aviv Geffen's melodies, and that doesn't change here.  Whatever the project becomes, I'm enjoying this album quite a bit.
B00DY951TO|5.0|This 3-record box set of old recordings is a breath of fresh air.  It is so great to hear the original studio recordings with just Dylan and often David Bromberg and Al Kooper playing originals and public domain folk songs.  It's so fresh to hear the songs before Columbia added strings, horns and the other production stuff they layered onto the recordings for release.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Tom Hanks acting was superb, but the story line is terrible. It's absolutely the worst movie I've ever watch. I did watch it to the end, but the finish was even worst.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|i saw the mini-series and i wanted to read the book. great book and i loved the characters very much, love paul
142312166X|5.0|My kids are advanced readers and loved this book.  The look and feel of the book made it more special.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|It's a well written biography of an interesting famous guy.  Read it and glow in the reflected popularity of a guy you didn't know and will never be.
B008469DGY|5.0|I love it. Challenges your patience just like real golf.  Once they have multiplayer which they say is coming soon the game would be worth six stars. 15 years ago people would have paid 50 dollars easy for it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I took a chance one day when I stumbled across Wool... I sure am glad I did! This was an amazing story! Incredible concept! When I wasn't reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about what it would be like to live in a silo. I can't wait to read what happens next!!!
B000ID37RM|4.0|I normally don't watch black and white movies, but I would watch this again. Even for being an older movie, it was still very good
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is super easy to use. I can watch YouTube, Netflix, Google Play Movies, Google Music, and most anything I can watch on my pc. You use either your smartphone, tablet, or pc to control the device.<br />The setup process is really easy. That said, I had trouble getting it to connect to my router. The problem turned out to be a setting on my router.<br />Best $35 I've spent.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Not my cup of tea..not at all what I expected.  Too much witchcraft so it was not a believable story.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Five stars<br />Very catching, it grabs you and holds you, you will never put it down<br /><br />Percy is the coolest
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This as another reviewer said is probably the best Angry Birds version yet.The graphics are crisp ,music excellent,and the sound effects great (love the bird/pig voices ).There is a extra level of play as you can play as the pigs on the \\"Porkside\\" and destroy the birds .I had to put my Kindle Fire Hd away last night it was so addictive .
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I really respect and admire Adele's talent and her powerful vocals.  However, when I've listened to this repeatedly I find that she sometimes sounds whiny.  I just have to take listening to the CD in small doses (not repeatedly on long car trips).
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|Well, I am a huge Milla Jovovich fan. I love most of her movies and resident evil movies. I have to say that this resident evil was just not up to par.  It felt as if the director was just making another movie just because he could. Pretty disappointing and I wish I would not have bought it.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This was a very funny movie that dealt with the painful topic of mental illness.  I liked that it depicted the anguish of the characters and their very real struggles with day to day coping, yet kept you laughing throughout.  The actors were amazing in their portrayals and the direction was top notch.  I've watched it twice and would watch it again, and I'm not one to watch movies over and over.  It's not often you find a movie dealing with mental illness that not only depicts the difficulty of living with such a disease but leaves you with hope that anyone can overcome the debilitating aspects of this disease with the right medication, love and support.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I really like the show! It has interesting characters and plot twists. Every time I feel like I know what is going to happen... it takes a totally different direction. I'd definitely buy the next season.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I haven't played a Missile Command-style game in a long while, so I was pleased to find that this game is easy. So far. Once I figured out about the upgrades, that is. I don't know if I missed it or if they forgot to let me know what the repair points are for, but once I spent a few I started getting Perfect Rounds. Add to that the fact that Missile Command makes for an excellent touchscreen game (those guys were WAY ahead of their time) and you get &quot;Not Bad&quot;.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I watched the first season and HAD to see the second season. It definitely has a twisted and great plot line.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|Love the movie, buyt it! Its a must have specially if you have kids, since in my experience is a childhood memory! A happy one!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Great music. The cast and singers were well picked! I listen to their cd the majority of the time in my car! Love the music!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|cant put this game down!! not enough time in the day to play! runs perfect on a kindle fire. lots of content. keep up the good work.
B0085OEA9U|3.0|This movie was alright. George Clooney and Anna Kendrick did a great job. It wasn't a movie that was a &#34;must see&#34;.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I was so excited to receive this case. But I was very disappointed when I opened it. When I opened it I realized immediately that the screen protector part of it was cracked.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|This read was so action packed and exciting from the beginning to the end. I could barely put it down to get my work done.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is a time killer! Recommend it to anybody who was or is into sim city. Always a plus when its free!!
B005XUC398|5.0|Scary good modern story of business.  A gem!  If you've ever been &#34;here&#34; you'll have goose-bumps.  Great casting and fast moving script.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|fun game get it I play it on the toliet also in a bath room at a park just comes out smooth thanks hill climb
111846446X|5.0|I'm a bit of the computer history buff, so I loved the story of our Raspberry Pi came about.  Thanks for giving the world this wonderful little device.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|World War Z stars Brad Pitt and is (loosely) based on the book of the same name by Max Brooks. Pitt plays a former United Nations investigator who hunts down a solution to the sudden zombie plague wreaking havoc across the world.<br /><br />The first thirty minutes of the film had me on the edge of my seat, cringing and wondering how the rating was only PG-13 instead of R. It's very intense with heart-pounding suspense and chase scenes. Though, unlike other zombie movies, the focus isn't gore. Which is good as these zombies are FAST. And they can turn others within seconds of biting.<br /><br />I had few expectations going in, other than knowing it was nothing like the book. So I was pleasantly surprised with the solid characters and story. The acting is outstanding. They did a good job making us care about the characters while so much is going on. World War Z is a global apocalypse meets zombie thriller.<br /><br />WORLD WAR Z Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack Includes:<br /><br />Blu-ray:<br />* Feature film in high definition (Unrated version)<br />* Origins--The filmmakers discuss collaborating with renowned actor/producer Brad Pitt to create a Zombie film the likes of which have never been seen.<br />* Looking to Science--Explore the scientific realities of Zombie behavior in nature and learn more about Zombies in literature and film.<br />* WWZ: Production<br />  - Outbreak--Go on set with Brad Pitt and director Marc Forster for a behind-the-scenes look at the film's breathtaking first attack in Philadelphia.<br />  - The Journey Begins--Delve deeper into Gerry's fight for survival during the dramatic escape in South Korea.<br />  - Behind The Wall--Explore the epic scene in Jerusalem and discover the incredible logistics of creating the elaborate stunts and crowd sequences.<br />  - Camouflage--Experience the final confrontation between Gerry and the Zombies and discover the phenomenal scope of the film's production.<br /><br />DVD:<br />*  Feature film in standard definition (Theatrical version)<br /><br />- Review previously posted at SciFiChick.nition (Theatrical version)<br /><br />- Review previously posted at SciFiChick.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|This is a fine production, although it's probably not for the faint of heart. There are indeed some kinky moments.<br /><br />You can skip the entire film except for the ending and your thirteen bucks will have been well spent. The last three or four minutes are stunningly unexpected and deeply moving. Ken Russell, eat your heart out.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I just recently discovered this series.  All I have to say is OMG!  This is fabulous!  Don't wait.  Get it now.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I liked the movie. It was very entertaining. I watched it with my husband. I would recommend the movie to someone else.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This movie, unlike many book-to-movie translations is true to the book by Jane Austin.  It captures the tone and society of the era.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|Briliant story and screenplay!!<br /><br />Should have won an Oscar whenever it was released<br /><br />The requirements for this review really suck
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This book gave me a lot more insights into Steve Jobs than I previously had. I knew Jobs was a control freak, could be a total jerk, etc. But I had no idea about his strange diets and his obsession with Zen. Definitely an interesting read.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|This was darker, and in this case better than the Robert Redford version.<br />The cast was great...more to what I visualized from the book..and yes the book is dark!<br />Leo and Toby were brilliant! The ony thing that startled me was Jay Z's music! Yes, I understand he was a producer, but that type of music wasn't prevalent in the era.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|This is the first application I have found that has solved the PC to Kindle photo transfer and organization task for me.....tried lots of others, but never very successful, especially as far as creating small &#34;albums&#34; from my large files in Picasa.  If it just had one additional feature it would be perfect....and that is reorganizaing pictures within an album on the Kindle so you can create/modify a slideshow.  You can do it easily up in the Google+ cloud album and then refresh the Kindle album, but not on the Kindle when you do not have web access.  Still, a great application.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This one of the best NIN music release in a long time! Extreme music mixes with great bass and lyrics to make you wonder. NIN is the best hands down!
030758836X|5.0|I have been meaning to read this book for awhile now and I'm so glad that I finally got around to it. First of all, in terms of plot, it was brilliant. The golden couple, the marriage gone wrong, but then it takes a turn that you cannot predict. The author does a great job of unraveling character development darker and darker at the exactly right pace. It is a fascinating study on how the surface often does not reflect what is truly going on inside a person, and that evil really can exist in the people surrounding you. Nick is drawn as the hapless male, being led through his life with a conflicting idea of himself and failing resolve. But Amy, wow, she was practically three dimensional once you learned the truth about her life (no spoilers!). I love that her inner dialogue is so very honest, and if we are honest with ourselves, represents many of the thoughts that women have but don't want to admit with such strength. How very true that we present ourselves so differently to achieve our goals.<br /><br />The other brilliant thing about this book is the prose itself. It is so very well written. There were paragraphs where I had to stop and reread, and thought to myself, I bet the author took an entire day to craft this paragraph just so. The beauty is intertwined with language that some may find vulgar (and if you are easily offended you might want to try another book as this one is dark), but its there and I am in awe of anyone who can write that way.<br /><br />Also, clear your schedule LOL. I couldn't put it down either. The ending was the ultimate evil and leaves some to your own interpretation. I still want to know what happened even after that, though I know they are fictional characters and none of it was real. Excellent work!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great, it's everything you like about the different runs, rushes, and dashes plus so much more. Also you can't help but love the little minions.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|I love the way this product works and how good the results come out. With no practice I was able to make the product preform just as advertised. Beautiful perfect circles!
B00C0W08XK|5.0|This is a typical Sudoku game that has different levels of difficulty. Very fun and addictive if you are a fan of this game. Great for your mind!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Out of all the hunger games series I think I enjoyed this one the most.  It was an amazing read.
0446310786|1.0|This book is very boring and the only reason I bought it was because I needed it for school-related things. Horrible book.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I just discovered this show on amazon and love it  I am a prime member so  I can watch it for free  it's well written with great actors and plots
B00ET7ICEQ|3.0|There are several songs I really like, but then there are a few that are just too 'old school' country for me.
B003OUXECE|5.0|If you liked the games or the setting of rapture this book fills in a few of the blanks before the first game
B009GX69RK|5.0|Love this show!! It's great to catch up on previous seasons without commericals, and I can rewatch them as many times as I want!
B004ZH66XO|4.0|I don't understand why this game is getting such bad reviews. It's a pretty fun game. It's a simple, fun, time killer with a minimum of permissions.
B000HF6XKO|4.0|Art imitates life. A story with no real conclusion as this movie demonstrates how the MIC manipulates world events to score big energy contracts. Along the way, good people lose their lives, while sleazy politicians and corporate executives cash in. It's a highly cliched but very intriguing movie. And considering we're seeing this whole scenario being played out yet again -- this time in Syria -- the movie couldn't be more timely.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a good idea for a game I really like the whole thing I just wish it was a little less crowded
B001EO2UKO|3.0|I am an ardent fan of Dido, but I can't get into this CD like I do with the other ones. It's just &#34;different&#34;. I still listen to it now and then, but it just doesn't do it for me.
0307887448|5.0|Not too often you find a book that is plausible, coherent and fun to read. From cover to cover, the author tells a fantastic story that is filled with great twists, fun dialogues and originality. The characters are well built, the adventure is persuasive and the flow of the story is superb. Those who grew up in the 80's and enjoyed playing the video games of the time, will feel even more attached to some of the details. Younger readers that are hooked into today's video games will enjoy it as much.<br /><br />At times, I just didn't want to reach the end of the book, as I enjoyed every page I read. Nevertheless, the ending was just as fantastic and exciting.<br /><br />Thank you Ernest Cline.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|I have to admit to being a lifelong ABBA fan but Agnetha's music stands on it's own merit. The melodies and arrangements are well done. The lyrics are a bit interesting and emotional at times, but altogether, a quite enjoyable collection.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Have to put up with ads but otherwise pretty fun and addictive.  Hard to put down.  Fytrjgf jfhhfc jhggjj km VfB ddf uuy
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The Piano Guys are fantastic! The music is so peaceful to listen to. I am not a big classical music fan, but these guys have drawn me in with their personalities, wonderful visual artistry that adds to the music, and the sweet feeling the music itself brings to me.  I have both of their CDs and am looking forward to whatever they do next. (On a recent car trip, I was listening to the CD as I drove through Utah. It was pretty cool since I had just watched the making of Paradise on the top of the cliff.)
B004VN5MNC|5.0|This is a fantastic music experience!!  If you LOVE Foo Fighters (as I do) you will be blown away at what you get on this one!! Dave & the boys are at the top of their game here and give the listener a high speed ride into what I can only describe as eargasm!!  I LOVE THIS!!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Very pleased. I ordered the 3 season set as a gift and was already an ardent fan. Now there is another....the gift recipient! There was a glitch in that the first and second discs of Season One were defective and stopped playing, I had been hesitant to order used discs but was very pleased that The Shoppes (from whom I had ordered) were very prompt in replacing the entire first season and even sent me an additional disc  of another program as a bonus for the inconvenience I experienced.. I would certainly use them again!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works well with Galaxy S4, and Kindle Fire. Only 3 apps available, but more than sufficient for our bedroom use. Inexpensive way to see Netflix streaming (Apple TV in our living room.) It was worth the wait to receive it. ALSO, our 'Prime' membership is well worth the annual fee. We use it all year long.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|We typically rent not buy but we really wanted to see this movie so we bought.  Terrible experience with buffering and picture quality!  I am not sure I will buy again.  I know that quality depends on download speed but we have fiber optic and 100 gig download and have no issues with other movie/video providers.  This one was just bad.  Would have enjoyed the movie much more had quality of delivery been better.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Only problem is that I don't even remember buying this.  Must have been a long time ago when my kids were much younger.  Maybe a gift.  Sort of sad that I can't remember.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie, delivery and picture quality was well worth the rent!  I would recommend this movie to all my family and friends.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just viewed the first 3 seasons - what an amazing, addictive drama.  Fantastic characters and story line!  Can't wait for season 4!!!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The characters are great.  Can't wait for next season on Prime!  Need more shows like this on Prime.  I am a fan of streaming.
B0052GVGYG|4.0|Great album and great music. I think the merger between her and her husband has changed her sound a little bit--not for the bad (not at all), but just different compared to &#34;just Susan.&#34; The TTB is a big, deep, and skilled band. Good music, no doubt. I do wish the rockin' and beltin' blues from Susan though.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|AMAZING this app is a must download if you like to mix music even if your new it has<br />A great use interface and its really easy to use
B0060MYM3S|5.0|My brother was talking about how he loved the first season, but missed the second season. so that was his gift. he was very happy
B006VFLIYK|2.0|I enjoyed the story, but it dragged on and on. By the time it started unravelling, I had forgotten a lot of the beginning, too wordy...
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I was not able to find this movie for a reasonable price in stores, so it was a nice surprise to find it online at a reasonable price.  Quality of the disc was excellent.
B0041KW076|5.0|The hi fidelity of his sound, the package, the build quality, are some things that you have to take in account if you like to buy this record. If you are a fan, buy all of them, This record reached 10/10 points.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW!!! It ia a great show. I enjoyed every single moment if it. I will be watching as long as it continues to come on.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This was a really good game.there's many different types of hidden object plus great puzzle games.the only bad news is that once again it's'one of the games that requires purchasing power to continue to play or wait hours to have the energy to play
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I love Lady Antebellum and although this is not one of their best, it is still worth it to me to have purchased it.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great for the kids and adults alike will have a good time and fun for all that likes the game
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Great product I bought to start charcoal for my smoker. This really don't seem as mini as it claims, make sure to take a gander at the specs! I can fill this thing with prolly 25-35 briquettes, which is enough for me to cook Dinner for 4-5 steaks on a Webber grill. In addition to getting more than I asked for, its made of sturdy materials which will last a long, long time. Thanks to Weber and amazon
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is awesome.  I like it better than the Apple TV.  I certainly hope more apps are able to work with it soon - this is a great way to watch video or listen to audio from a tablet or laptop. That said, it IS limited in sources you can view from.<br /><br />The setup was soooooooo simple.  I read the (rather sparse) instructions in the box, and asked my 11 year old to see if she could follow the directions to set it up.  She did, no issues.  wonderful design.  Great job, Google.<br /><br />Amazon, get on this train! Get support for this in your Video app for Android! it's sweet.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love Spider and for sure this is one of the best out there, except for the popup ads which are a distraction. I would pay good money to have this game without them.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|These 5 people are a perfect blend, and a perfect counterpoint to one another.  Sounds odd, but it is true.  You can distinguish the part each plays, but together they are so much more than any individual singer.  Being a bass, I envy Avi - man has a SUPER low bass voice like I haven't heard in years. Mitch Grassi - wow.  haven't heard a high male voice that good since... maybe Jeremy Jackman?  It's damn hard to tell where Mitch's regular singing voice stops and his falsetto begins.<br /><br />All the members are really, really talented.  Can't recommend enough.  I ope for more of their original music on their next album - they make average pop songs phenomenal, but their own work is outstanding.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I read about this movie in Entertainment Weekly and immediately wanted to see it. I grew up watching the original beach movies and agree with be other reviewers. The characters were spot on and the costumes and sets and acting styles just totally bring you back to those movies. The songs were also pretty good.  I love fallin for ya. It sounds like it was recorded in that time period and has a great hook. Ross Lynch was great and so funny. The sequel needs more Kiki. I'm curious about her backstory.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|We like the tangible nature of building Minecraft with Lego product.  Lego builds great instructions for new users, and allows unlimited flexibility for everyone.  Thank you for providing a Minecraft theme, it was a great way to introduce my young minecraft-obsessed grand-nephew to the wonderful world of Legos.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|easy to use easy to setup.  works great.  fun to show off phone and computer to your TV magically .
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|a lovely writer.  lovely.  i grew up reading Ray Bradbury's short stories, and I prefer them to novels he's done (the deft gestures towards a a moral compass in his stories becomes a little too polemic and clunky for me in Fahrenheit 451).  These are wonderful to read, and stand the test of time.
030789701X|5.0|got this for anniversary gift i believe but anyways he loved it he use's it every time he plays skyrim so its great for gift or if you need help threw out the game i would say you should buy this book it was in great shape and everything its pro one of his mosts loved gifts.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I watched Sereniy years ago, before hearing of Firefly. They mentioned the short-running series during the extras, which sparked my interest and my future passion in the show.<br /><br />My girlfriend isn't too big on science fiction, but she fell in love with both Serenity and Firefly. She was pretty irked that there was only one season and one movie for us to watch. If she likes it, so will you.<br /><br />A note about order: Serenity should be watched after you've watched the series, as there are some game-changers here. You can absolutely watch Serenity before Firefly and still know what's going on, if you must. That's what I did, and I still knew who the characters were and what their backgrounds were.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I got carried away with the hype on this. Potentially it will be a winner. But right now, the number of sources you can download videos from is limited (mainly Netflix and You Tube). Others will probably show up down the road. But not for now.<br />Oh, and you can't stream your own content. Sigh.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched Serenity years ago, which sparked my interest in Firefly. I loved this show and I've watched the entire season twice so far. I recently introduced my girlfriend to it and she also fell in love with it. You can't go wrong with this futuristic western.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the show was cancelled after just one season. Everyone's pretty sure that this decision was one of the signs of the Apocalypse.<br /><br />One note: the pilot episode is dark. I mean, it's hard to see what, exactly, is happening. It takes place outside, at night. The first portion of the pilot is also a bit slow. With it being slow and hard to see what's going on, the first 30 minutes can be hard to get through. If you do make it through, though, you'll be glad you did.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|For the price this scanner really does it! I have used it to scan color negative film and mounted color (positive) slides. It takes a little getting used to. The documentation is fairly good, but a little lacking.<br />Most of the scans are very usable. Since my slides are old, I'm not sure how much color imbalance is due to the slides themselves and how much is due to the scanner. Most slides turned out fine - especially after some tuning from an application like Photoshop Elements.<br />Good enough for me to go ahead and convert my slides from the 50s to the 80s.<br />And the price is certainly right!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|So much has been said about Silver Linings Playbook (both good and bad). In an effort not to be redundant or repetitive about just how brilliant this film is I will take a slightly different angle in its analysis. For starters, the acting is stellar and right on point with depicting the struggles of living with bipolar and manic depression. The main characters (brilliantly played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) are forced to confront their demons and all the while learn from each other about coping with ups and downs. Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from a state institution, as part of a plea bargain after violently assaulting a man in the throws with his wife. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is a young widow who suffers with the very same condition he deals with. Medicines have not worked well for either of them. Their inner anguish is badly stigmatized by those around them and their erratic behavior badly impairs their social lives and connection with the world around them. Still, their insight and inability to filter (in the words of Pat) provide them with a rare insight into the world that others do not have. Some may call it insight. I call it a badly broken kind of brilliance. Pat's mantra is \\"excelsior.\\" This fuels his wish to find the silver lining in every situation in his life - good or bad.<br /><br />In spite of the restraining order that Pat's wife has against him, he wishes to give a letter to her anyway. Tiffany will deliver the letter on the condition that he practice and be part of a dance competition with her as her partner. This arrangement paves the way to an interesting series of developments. Not planning to give away any more plot details beyond this. If you want more, simply read the other reviews. I do want to state that I appreciate the frank depiction and sensitivity that mental illness is portrayed in this film. It is not easy to watch the painful outbursts and anguish that the characters go through. Yet, the actors do such a brilliant and sensitive job with their roles that you are left with great insight into the mind and conflicts behind mania, manic depression, bipolar and emotional pain. Extraordinary. Jennifer Lawrence definitely earned her Oscar here. What a brilliant young actress I look forward to seeing more of in the future.ors do such a brilliant and sensitive job with their roles that you are left with great insight into the mind and conflicts behind mania, manic depression, bipolar and emotional pain.

1932100660|5.0|Documented, logically presented review of diet influence on health outcome.  Reader's choice of diet is left to health outcomes.  Unique!
B009WUBERW|1.0|Bad acting, bad plot, just glad it was a free rental and I didn't have to rent it. That's it.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Never got forced closes with old version. Harder to use too. Maybe a little more useable info. All the pretty pictures reminds me of motion pictures' love affair w special effects: very juvenile. I had to reload after I got the latest forced close, and I finally figured it out: the reason for the \\"upgrade\\" was so Weather Channel could monitize their site: just look at all the ads now! It's worse than a major league ballpark!
B00BNPI7VU|5.0|Just as  good as the other books. Loved the kitten and he made the kitten act like a real kitten too. Can't wait to read the other books. Adorable!!!
B000BZISTE|5.0|This movie was pretty racy at the time but now it is relatively mild. Good movie, really glad I purchased it.
0811879542|5.0|Great interactive read aloud for young kids ages 3-6. Colorful pages and the kids really enjoyed the magic of pressing the dot!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Whoever wrote this app is a complete screw up! High School kids can do a better job. The game is glitchy at best on any platform. They have been doing this for a couple years now, and there is still no save functionality. So when the game crashes, you lose all save game data. This is very unappealing because after putting several hours into the game to have it crashes and forces you to start COMPLETELY OVER. I don't see any reason to invest anymore time or money into it. The TCG game is great but this piece of ship is appalling. I think the reviews speak for themselves. BUYER BEWARE!!!
B0091X4HQA|5.0|I purchase this movie to watch again and again. I loved this movie and would recommend to everyone to watch
0062515675|5.0|Thank you for the timely manner and for a clean product and nice packaging. This was a gift for my parents as I couldn't part with mine! Thank you!
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|I haven't had a chance to check it out yet, but the Steele case is quite nice for that alone it's worth it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Alawar made another great Hidden object game with a good storyline. It throws a few puzzles in the mix too. I highly recommended this game, easy play and it will keep you entertained.
B0036EH3U2|4.0|I haven't opened it yet. However, I did watch the entire show on tv when it aired it is definitely worth it. .
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love this show and have watched every episode.  I bought them all on DVD because we did not get this show in Germany where I was living.  I watched them so fast that now I am dying while waiting for the next episode to come out!!!
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|Simple little game, got somewhat boring after the 10th stage. It's a time waster for doctors offices or long lines.
B00F036VFU|5.0|This album delivered the funk! As someone from New Orleans I can tell you that EC has used his trips to my hometown to help shape his music. I can hear that New Orleans funky beat all throughout. And The Roots always deliver the goods.
B004O7EVLY|5.0|If you liked their first album then you will like this one too. They maintained their same vibe and just continued to write great material. No major deviations. My favorite tracks are &#34;Ain't Fit to Live Here,&#34; which I crank and play over and over before I can move on and &#34;The Siren,&#34; which I actually heard them play live on the road a few years back when they were touring with CKY in 2009. That was before this album even came out. The song is so memorable that I recognized it instantly after all this time. Finally got this album and I'm glad I did. This album just confirmed for me that Graveyard is a great band with excellent songwriting talent that deserves much more exposure.
B002N5N5QQ|4.0|I like the tv show and I am glad that I was able to get the seasons cheaper than the movie store
B0025KVLU6|3.0|Nothing too special or high lighted. Pretty much like the original version. Thats all I can say.Thats my review. OK
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Def not for children but one of the best movies of its debuting year. A movie not to miss. Amazing all together.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I feel this is a must see movie for any fan of music. or musician who has recorded music in a studio.
1476734941|5.0|If you want it, this is an end to the crazy cycle of dieting, endless thinking about food, eating and body shape. It's a sensible, easy program that holds the promise of long life and good health.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. And addicting! My whole family loves to play. I would recommend for any Mario fan.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|&#34;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&#34; is a solid Alice In Chains album. I bought &#34;Black Gives Way to Blue&#34; purely out of curiosity, and ended up really enjpying it, but bought &#34;Dinosaurs&#34; with higher expectations. The record didn't let me down.<br /><br />The sound of the album is one more step in the evolution of AIC. There are no crazy new deviations, no sudden changes. Cantrell had been the primary songwriter anyway, and contributed more than his fair share of lyrics as well, so that these last 2 records feel like AIC records.<br /><br />As far as vocalists being replaced, I feel that this is one of the more successful cases. The vocals are close enough to Staley's that it isn't jarring to go from an older album to one of these newer records (and probably even more important in a live setting), and yet it doesn't sound like DuVall is completely aping Staley. I haven't heard any of his other bands, so I'm not sure if an attempt was made to sound like Staley.<br /><br />This is a good metal/hard rock album, and a worthy addition to Alice In Chains' discography.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I LOOOOVE ITTTTT. Best series EVER. I'm in love with the characters. I'm in love with the story. I'm in love. I can't wait until the next one. 😍😍😍
B0007GAEGC|5.0|My cd was used, but in awesome condition, no problems at all. I love music and couldn't wait to receive it.  It arrived quickly.  Would use this vendor again for sure!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I've never watched this show before & I'm really glad I started watching it because now I'm hooked! I'm anxious to watch the other seasons & get caught up to the current season.  It constantly keeps me wondering what is going to happen next, but is also decent enough that if my kids watch some of it I don't need to worry about them being traumatized.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Great read. Characters took a while to warm up to, but once the story began rolling, I couldn't put it down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the best solitaire games I have come across. Great ease of use and well executed graphics. Great game!
B005LAIISU|4.0|Ice Age: Continental Drift is a playful movie. The movie focuses again on our furry friends including Manny, Diego, and Sid. The premise of the movie focuses on Manny's teenage daughter, Peaches. Scat's antics, the squirrel on the cover, cause an interesting turn of events leading the viewer to encounter a number of interesting new characters and ideas for the ice age series. Without spoiling the story, I can say that the film features a solid cast, strong family themes, and a simple and straightforward plot that while predictable and shallow, is both playful and fun. It is very enjoyable and engaging for those interested in a light hearted family film (that is good if you watch it alone as well).<br /><br />The video itself is wonderful from a technical standpoint. The colors are saturated, the detail in the fur and environment is sharp and interesting. While few and far between, the blacks showcase detail and texture that will prove to be interesting and engaging.<br /><br />The audio features a DTS-HD Master Audio and takes advantage of a wide dynamic range that while not blowing you out of your chair loud, will do nice to differentiate standard dialogue. The music found throughout the film is integral, yet never gets in the way of the dialogue which remains clear and understandable no matter what happens. For those with a powerful subwoofer, the movie will provide ample opportunities to exercise it.<br /><br />In total, this movie was fun, playful, and a great for the family. It never goes very deep, the characters aren't the most dynamic, but it is the perfect movie to watch when looking for a quiet and enjoyable experience.
B00BMUVUZG|5.0|Great continuation from previous novels. Once started I couldn't put it down. Engaging from the beginning. All John Grisham novels are fantastic reads.
B008N1V11U|1.0|This game looked fun at first but it is a piece of crap. It took for ever to install. Dont waste your money
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|it was a good read. It was for my 6th grader and he loved it. He read it twice. Great
B000KIPT30|5.0|This thing is build like a rock. Very solid amp with clean sound. I am very impressed with the quality. Not that this matters to me at all but the pictures here make the product look white when it is actually a metallic silver. Just thought I should mention that for anybody who might be concerned with that type of thing. I would recommend this product in both consumer and professional settings. This is a good product.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed reading this book. I found it hard to put in down. The characters were life like and their stories compelling. I would like to see if the author would extend the series. Because now I am a devoted reader.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Can't wait to start reading the next book! Love this series! This is the type of series you wish never ended.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I hooked the Chromecast up to a Toshiba 20 inch TV in our bedroom. I didn't want to have anything complicated like a DVR or computer in the BR, which is what I use elsewhere in the house. I've watched several programs on Netflix and some high and low quality videos off YouTube, and I can say the playback if impressive. The Toshiba is 1080P and the picture never froze up or pixalated in any way.<br /><br />I've got an ASUS wireless N300 network, with nothing set up to give priority to the Chromecast device. So what I'm getting in the way of performance should be \\"typical\\" for me at least. Most of my devices are wired gigabyte ethernet, so the wireless capacity is pretty open most of the time. Will have to test it with simultaneous laptop and phone usage to see if the performance suffers.<br /><br />One thing to note is if you're running a PC with less than Windows 7, Chromecast for Windows won't work. That is something not mentioned in the Amazon ad. Plus it only runs on the 2.4 Ghrz frequency and not the 5 ghrz used on dual band networks. So it is possible to get interference from devices running on the 2.4 frequency. We have a home phone using that frequency, but it's not used very often and shouldn't pose a problem.<br /><br />I'd give the device a 5 if there were more apps, or if you could stream your own content from within your network. I think that was originally supposed to be possible, but it seems to have gotten yanked in the final product. Perhaps it'll come later, and they just wanted to get it out on time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful book. I enjoyed the book way better than the movie. The story keeps you engaged throughout. Good job NS!
B002WJI66C|5.0|This is a Christmas Present and my son is going to love it.  He has some Mario characters already and wanted this one too.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Although I understand the target audience is tweens or teens, I can say that this brings me back to all the awkwardness and self doubt of the teenage years with an updated tilt. The stars are engaging and the supporting adults are entertainly clueless.  I should not like this so much but I do!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|You can fight for the bad side or good side.  My son is fighting for the bad side and once done with the game is going to switch to the good side and do it all over again.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|If it's FREE to watch then go for it.<br />But avoided paying any rental fees or making an actual purchase.
1936891026|5.0|Broke through the nonsensical attitudes and barriers that writers are often faced with.  As a friend once said about writing. &#34;Just cut your veins and bleed.&#34; Not that bad!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have always love animals, but never really tried to think from their standpoint.. This book made me do it (I have a cat at home, not alien to animals or anything.. just never thought about it). And of course, the whole story is very touching. Just a great story to read for relaxation.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Probably one of the most underrated TV series that was ever on television that got cancelled way before its time to flourish.  The irony was the series became more popular AFTER it was cancelled and when the movie was released.  You will not be disappointed by purchasing this series!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Very poignant, the descriptions of the Holocost where so vivid and real. The emotion of the characters was real as well. I felt like I was right there with Sarah.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This could quite possibly be the best purchase I have made for my PS3 to improve my overall FPS gaming experience.  This has made a huge impact on my gaming experience and the ability to both have it synced to my phone and my PS3 is invaluable.  It also worked with both my Macbook Pro & Windows 8 Pro Desktop because I wanted to test it, although I am not going to buy another just for use on them :)
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|I have tried many car racing games over the years. This is by far the best. The graphics and physics are absolutely stunning. And it is difficult enough to make it a challenge for anyone. I continue to recommend the app to friends. If you enjoy this kind of game, you will not be disappointed. Illusion Magic, you have a winner here
B003W0BYQ4|5.0|John Wayne at his best.<br />The combination of John Wayne and Dean Martin in Rio Bravo turned out awesome.<br />Dean, cast as a drunk, allowed John to star without encumberance.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love this series, only wish each book was a separate file.  If you loose your place it hard to fine where you left off.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. I was in tears after the first chapter. What I most struggled with is the disappointment of our human nature.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Not the best but definitely not the worst. We liked the Bourne series a lot more, bu this was still good. The story is engaging and original, which is a bit rare these days. The movie ends pretty much how you would expect it to end with the good guy kicking everyone's collective butts - we like that type of ending.<br /><br />There is some profanity including an F-Bomb, and a lot of shooting and fighting. Fortunately the violence isn't overly graphic - i.e. when most of the characters a shot it shows them drop from a distance so its not gory.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I LIKE THE COURT ROOM DRAMA.  COULD EASILY DO WITHOUT THE DIVERSITY ELEMENT.  THE ACTORS PLAY THEIR PARTS VERY WELL.
B005I64U5C|3.0|I am reviewing the case not the movie. I liked the movie but the case came broken all to pieces. I keep empty cases on hand for 1,2,3 and 4 DVDs. This was a 2 DVD case so I replaced the broken one. Luckily the DVD was not damaged. It might have happened in shipping since the DVD was sent in an envelope with almost no protection via regular mail service.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I like Bruce Willis in this kind of movie.  Lots of action but comedic elements as well.  It was fun.
B000O77QD8|5.0|came in way before the it was due. Great movie, planning on having a double feature with Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima over the weekend
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|Chaplin is timeless in this comedic tour de force. It is a classic in comedy...many tried to copy him but could not
B000O77RLE|5.0|came in record time, was very impressed with how quick it came in, planning on watching this movie and Flags or our Fathers tommorow
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It is easy and intuitive.  Can't wait till I upgrade.  So I have other options. Just this beginner start, I am happy.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|Just bought this on 9/19 forcmy kindle fire. Having some serious graphics glitches. Still pretty fun. It will easily be a 4 or 5 star game after some smoothing out.
B00E7T8QHY|1.0|The developers believe you need to pay for the chess pieces. The original download includes only chess pieces that look like checkers. When you try to play a game, your choice is to see the overhead view which is all circles. You cannot distinguish the pieces. In the angle view, it is difficult to move a pawn because you can barely see the edge.<br /><br />You have to pay for everything. There is a charge for playing pieces, a charge for the environment-like anyone cares, a charge for tactics problems etc. the list goes on. The play seems slow. You can buy the whole package with different pieces and environments for $13 bucks.  I deleted it. Oh, I forgot, there is a charge for level of play and updates.<br /><br />CHESS GENIUS IS FINE FOR ME.
B000EGDB10|2.0|After hearing about movie for years, I finally decided to watch it, overall good movie but it wasn't that hard to get. Just went to Best Buy.
1250030951|3.0|See more of my reviews on Birth of a New Witch! My copy was an ARC I received from the publisher via NetGalley.<br /><br />Having just been through my first year of college, Cath's basic story is familiar enough. Of course, I didn't experience the dilemma of being a BNF fanfic writer in college, but being on your own and not being terribly interested in what college offers because you're doing your own thing? Totally me. In fact, this review is told with a lot of personal anecdotes because the intersection of my very recent college experience and my usual reviewer's eye colored my perspective a certain way.<br /><br />Cath is a well-developed heroine who has her rough edges and is a little too soft for her own good, but her personality rubs me the wrong way and made me unwilling to invest much in her. It's explicitly stated Cath doesn't want to make new friends, which is a little ridiculous to me. She blows off invitations to eat dinner with other people only to go eat by herself shortly thereafter and looks down her nose at the people trying to be friendly with her and include her in stuff.<br /><br />Contrast that with me. Cath and I have the same people issues and the same dedication to our writing that sometimes takes precedence over people. Even then, I blew off invitations to eat with people not because I wanted to keep people away but because I'm ashamed of my picky eating. The time I spent in my room writing or goofing off got away from me and by the end of the year, I'm certain my hallmates hated me when I felt awkward around them to begin with. My stupid assumptions caused me to fight with my roommates and you don't need to know how sad I was when I learned everyone in the hallway went out together and no one breathed a word to me.<br /><br />If anyone gets Cath's people issues and first-time-in-college issues, I do. It's so FRUSTRATING to see someone with the same issues seek out all the wrong solutions and never fix the root problem. As bad as my first year was peoplewise (one of my roommates was such a pig I had to clean the bathroom TWICE and she let her massive mess spill out of her room), I still made great friends and look forward to seeing them again. This is why I have no sympathy for Cath and never invested myself in her story: because we're so similar and quite honestly, I may have had it worse than her and still handled it all better. Six hours from home vs. Cath's one and she never experienced anxiety that caused her months of debilitating physical pain and exhaustion.<br /><br />Didn't I say this was going to be Anecdote City?<br /><br />Now, less anecdotes, more criticism. Rowell's writing is decent enough and allows her multi-layered characters to take center stage. For character-driven novels, this is exactly the kind of writing that works even if it's a little bland sometimes. Rowell's writing is also a little weird sometimes. Consider gems like these:<br /><br />\\"The squirrels on campus were beyond domestic; they were practically domestically abusive (ARC, ~10%).\\" (This being because people feed them a lot and they like the beg for food.)<br /><br />\\"Sometimes the intimacy and affection in [her boyfriend's] voice were too much for Cath. Sometimes she felt like he was talking to them like her dad talked to her and Wren. Like they were both his girls (ARC, ~70%).\\" (Comparing how Levi speaks to Cath to how her dad speaks to her squicked me out. Bad comparison.)<br /><br />There are also heroic blushes, fetal smiles, and too many other out-of-place moments to count. It's supposed to be fun but it more often comes out strangely. There are moments where it breaks the fourth wall to tell us about the college routine, life, etc. Not only is it not breaking the wall well (it's so much fun when the fourth wall gets broken, but it's best used in a comedic way, in my opinion), it makes me unsure if it's Cath looking down on all this or the narrator themselves.<br /><br />But in short, this is the real reason Ididn't like Fangirl, readers: I am actually Grumpy Cat and have fooled you since before you knew I existed. Suckers.didn't like Fangirl, readers: I am actually Grumpy Cat and have fooled you since before you knew I existed. Suckers.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The game is a lot of fun and gets kind of challenging in later rounds :) im glad i bought it
B00514HDNW|5.0|I loved the book. Not too many aspects I didn't like about it. It's a pretty quick read too. You could probably sit down and finish it within 4 hours. Definitely worth it. Amazing book. I know this is said way too often, but it is tons better than the movie. They aren't even similar. Good read.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is fun for the whole family. This is a great way to bond with order children. Definitely recommend for anyone
B00B9366VO|5.0|I watched this movie with a bit of naivety, not really knowing what it was about or what to expect. Even as a musician, composer, producer, and engineer of my own music, I never really followed the music industry &#34;who's who&#34; and all that stuff. Personally, only bands that I really love get my attention, and even some of them I couldn't tell you the names of the members. I'm a real rarity when it comes to music: I listen to music for the music. Not the photos, videos, press, People Magazine and Rolling Stones coverage and I do not care what other people or the industry tries to tell me is good. I know good because I'm listening to the talent, the arrangement, the composition, the lyrics... all of the things missing from 99% of todays &#34;AutoTune&#34;-ed world.<br /><br />So getting back to this movie, I was spellbound. I had no idea that a large percentage of the great music that came before and made an indelible mark on the music industry was recorded in this shabby little 24-track 2-Inch tape analog studio in LA.<br /><br />But what really impressed me was the fact that Dave Grohl saw what I saw, and knows what I know, and sees a need, a market, and a longing for real music to come out of the mainstream music industry again. I think we are on the cusp of something big, another wave of amazing stadium filling bands and talent, and the wholesale rejection of manufactured, fast-food music created by less than talented individuals that can't program much more than a 4/4 time with only downbeats on the kick drum.<br /><br />I don't want to give it away, but I will say this: after watching this movie, I've been thinking very hard about that 24-track 2-Inch tape studio I had a chance to purchase about a year ago and passed on it because &#34;everything can be done on a computer&#34;. Nothing can replace a good board, hardware in racks, and the warmth and musicality of tape. I just might be joining Dave and opening a Florida Gulf Coast analog recording studio after watching this movie. Of course, there will be computers, but they'll be used as tools, not as crutches.<br /><br />Check out my music at jerryboutotmusic.com - you will love it if you're tired of twerking and dumbloops.

0142418471|5.0|Bought this for my daughter who loves John Green books!  She loves it and her friends can't wait for her to get down reading it so they can read it!
B005EHILV4|4.0|I added this to a desktop computer used for voiceovers on my son's Simon and Adrien cartoons that he is converting to video (simonandadrien.com - youtube.com/simonandadrien).<br /><br />It's got a surprisingly good sound for what it is and the price point. I would consider buying a larger version of the Behringer USB mixers for my professional studio (jerryboutotmusic.com).
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love being able to purchase books for my kindle and start reading immediately, no wait for shipping, etc, I am very happy with my kindle and plan on getting a new one when I can ..
B004VFN72S|5.0|Great movie. Interesting and held my attention. Interesting topic good actors and a great story line. I would recommend highly!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't understand why so many people gave the book one star. I thought this was the best book out of the series, so far. There's still so many questions unanswered that I understand why there will be more books to follow. The sex scenes were HOT and ****SPOILER**** Eva and Gideon get married.  Perfect!!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excellent LOA book. Writing is top-notch! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality self-help book! Just Buy It!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautifully done, I'm hooked! The sets, the costumes, the characters-well all of it really. The actors are among the best, but Maggie Smith is my favorite!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I loved this book! As one who has no experience with drug use this book helped me empathize more with the struggles of the addicts in my life. I thought this was cleverly written by not only giving the reader the thoughts, emotions and struggles of Nikki Sixx but also the affect of his drug use on those around him. Plus, he's a funny guy!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It makes a lot of sense and if you are honest when answering the questions it is very useful in helping to understand each other!
B00DQVST76|1.0|I am so appalled at how bad the quality of this Blue Ray is.  What the heck is going on?  This is really terrible on your part Madonna.  As a fan for the last 27 years, you owe your fans better than this.  Get on this mess and get it fixed for your fans.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|my six year old son loves this game : ) he wont stop playing! its a really fun game! I would for sure recommend!
B00F35BV64|1.0|Awful script, simple high-school type characters - the nerd, the jock, corny dialogue, terrible acting.  A made-for-tv type film that has been done again, and again.  The target audience is adolescent boys age 12-15.  If you are the target you might like it.  Grown-ups should avoid this waste of time.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|so i took a long time to watch buty im glad i did one of the good ones ilkl watch agin
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Love the game.  HATE the boosts - they are nothing more than cheats.  If I am in a game with cheaters I quit and forfeit my 2 tokens.  I do not like cheaters!!!!  Would be a 5 - but with the cheats only getting a 2.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|So glad I decided to read this book. Thought it was well written. Took me less than 2 days to read it. Will read another of her books now.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Unbelievable characters Pat conversations Didn't make me care about either one I didnt want to finish it.I am surprised at the good reviews
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This battery dies fast! Just over 30-40 min. Yet it takes up to 2+ hours to charge! But I don't totally regret buying it
B001NLL93W|5.0|I couldn't put it down although I had to so I could go to work. Combines a little bit of everything that I love in a book.
B00AEBB9K0|5.0|I didn't understand some of this movie.  Could use some help:<br />1) When Derek says \\"The building must be at least three times bigger than this\\", it doesn't make any sense.  The building was clearly a scale model.  It would have to be probably 250 to 500x the size in real life.  Anyone would know that.<br /><br />2) Why was Derek at the DAY Spa for a full week?<br /><br />3) What is the difference between \\"Blue Steel\\" and \\"Le Tigra\\"?  I get that \\"Magnum\\" is totally different, but the first two seem very similar.<br /><br />4) How did Hansel remove his underwear by reaching down his pants?  Doesn't seem possible.<br /><br />Still trying to wrap my head around this one.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Totally enjoyed it. Lee Child is an interesting author and have started reading all his books, now on #4. Enjoy
B00125JP1C|4.0|A good movie, with complete senseless violence, when you're in the mood for such. Definitely not a soft chic flick.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is very interesting.  I would recommend it.  It is well worth watching because it encompass a great combination storyline with historical aspects to it.
B008JFUO36|3.0|this is a really cool movie and he arrive to me i a good cheap i will get more move
B0058FW06Y|2.0|I remember seeing the trailer in the theater and thinking this has potential and would be something different from everyting else showing.  I had some time to kill and the HD rental on this was only $1.99.  I am SO glad I only spent the $1.99.  It was like watching a video game.  Good graphics but thats about it.  no plot, no story
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great story!  Truly enjoyed the epilogue!!<br />Truly enjoyable to read and it was hard putting it down at night!  Highly recommend!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Just one example of my &#34;notepad&#34; experience. In a doctor's exam room when he says, &#34;I'll be right back&#34;. I pulled out my kindle and wrote down what he had said so far, while it was still fresh in my mind. Love it!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|too many bugs and the latest update cause my whole game to crash!  Graphics were good, but not worth the hassle trying to load, and reload just to play....
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This calculator is just right for my purposes of simple calculations. Easy to use, sized just right too. I dont use the scientific ones. Just<br />quick basic math stuff. Very pleased. And free is the best price!
B000HF6ZR0|4.0|This movie is star packed and has a very unique approach to sci-fi.  It is a little complicated and needed better explanation.  I watched it three times before I understood.  Very suspenseful and you really dont find out the secret until the end.  Also I call this movie sci-fi even though it all takes place on earth with no aliens and no gadgets,  you will have to watch it to see what I mean.  The year this movie came out the competition was fierce so it went by the sideline and was forgotten,  thats why I call it a hidden jem.  I wish they would remake this one with just about the same cast and the secret was impressive.
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|The movie opens in 1977 as Liberace (Michael Douglas) is starring in Las Vegas and seventeen year old Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) has just become his latest boy-toy.  They carry on a passionate affair for five years before Lee's eye begins to wander again.<br /><br />This is not a biography of Liberace, but rather the story of Lee and Scott's affair.  The two stars are very good, although Douglas' Liberace wasn't quite as likable as I'd wished.  The two make a dynamic duo and really hold one's attention.  Rob Lowe has a funny role as a plastic surgeon with one too-many bad eye jobs.  Debbie Reynolds has a few lines as Lee's mother. The sets and costumes are lavish and the whole movie glitters with a Vegas aura.<br /><br />The movie is based on Scott Thorson's memoir, so, naturally, he comes out as the hero and victim while Liberace is the slimy predator.  Much of the graphic storyline had me cringing in shock, but, still, I watched. I was a big fan of Liberace's old TV show and this film doesn't change that, but it did sadden me a bit.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent writing with a plot that kept you coming back for more. Deep insight in to some of the tragedies that affect families such as death of a child, affairs, etc. The author touched on several. Loved how the characters were tied together in one way or another.Looking forward to reading more books by Moriarty.
B00BB8OHMW|4.0|Saw this movie a while ago and loved it as much the second time around.  It is understandable how Gwynneth Paltrow won an Oscar.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I have read through this series twice, going on three times, and every time I read through even a chapter it feels as if the books are getting better.  Which to me, they are. I would recommend everyone read this series, it keeps me up until ridiculous hours of the night. The books will pull you into them. Each time I read I feel as if I am a part of the book. Truly amazing.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|This is a great movie with a terrific cast. I loved it when it first came out and it's still great today.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The only down thing about it is the screen lighting, not like reading off a Kindle appliance.  Otherwise, I love it a lot.
B000W1AO0I|4.0|This is my first taste of Muddy Waters.It was not a disappointment. A few of the songs weren't as good as some of the others but overall its a very enjoyable cd.However, I would love to hear the record album. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one of his releases based on what I've heard here
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Not finished, not sure I will ever finish it.  Do not care for this author's writing style.<br />More words are unnessary!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|It is an interesting movie. Actors are good. I loved the concept but it needed a bit more about the aliens to give it a 5.
B00640UICA|4.0|I liken this type of game to minesweeper where I can see all the mines... it is fun and challenging.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Great original story, fun characters, good soundtrack. Would have gotten 5 stars if there were more cameos by other iconic game characters, but this was probably due to licensing costs, so I understand.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|This is a really fun app that has  good feel and easy to learn and very difficult for me to master... so I won't... I'll just play it...
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I thought this book did an amazing job interweaving the two worlds. They really brought the shadow world to life and made it realistic in the present day. I'll be reading it again!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is the perfect app for doing nothing but thinking... I have no real need for a drawing program like this but it is a great fun app.
B008EKOIN8|4.0|Once again he made me reevaluate something I've been doing all my life- eating food. It might be overly long for some people.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|This show was quite inventive for it's time. Very different from the bang, bang shoot 'em up shows that we've grown accustom to.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game but am stuck on one particular puzzle.  I've been trying to work on it for a month now and just cannot get it.  I do not know how to buy hints and will have to ask around how to do it.  I could play this one forever.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|He thinks this is one of the best movies he's ever seen.  I tend to agree with him.  It's good that Michael Oher has proven to be an excellent NFL player.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It is very good piece to have. Very functional. It works great and works very well with the kindle fire
B00CVS453C|3.0|Maughan's thesis is that by employing a few, easily-understood techniques and materials, his reader will be able to create high-quality portraits. This is true, but it is not, as Maughan seems to think, the only way or even the best way. I am not completely convinced.<br /><br />The Good,<br />Very, very good exposition of his theory.<br />Very good illustrative examples.<br />Provides a lot of information that will work with any style of portrait drawing<br /><br />The Bad.<br />His method is not the only way.<br />He doesn't talk about the weaknesses of his method<br />He could have spared the reader the sections on drawing imaginative figures and painting.<br /><br />Maughan's Artist's Complete Guide to drawing the Head is a hard book to judge.<br /><br />Maughan puts forth the idea that it is possible to draw the human head using carefully-redered shapes of lighter and darker tone instead of with the traditional method of drawing a line and filling in the shadows. Someone with a sense of humor try to sum up his book with, \\"Draw the shadows and highlights correctly and blammo! you have a head!\\"<br /><br />He calls this method \\"Chiaroscuro\\" (Italian for \\"bright/dark\\") but he means it in a way that is different from the use of strong contrasts between lit- and unlit areas on human forms that Caravaggio made famous. He means attention to the shapes and tones of the areas of greatest contrast and he does a great job of distilling this into a method with useable, understandable parts.<br /><br />The book would be fine if Maughan had stopped there, but he doesn't. He goes on to overstate the strength of his method in a way that lessens the real vigor of his opinion.<br /><br />Maughan looks at drawing as a prelude to painting and the use of shapes of tone to draw as the most effective way of going about it, but at times, his thought seems to go beyond imparting useful ideas to slide into dogma..<br /><br />At times, he seems to equate the side of the point with wisdomand virtue in a way that is just plain annoying if you've had an art history class, or to atelier-style, classical drawing techniques (with their obsessive attention to searching clarity and deadly accuracy) that you find in other books.<br /><br />He doesn't say, \\"this is just one way of drawing faces,\\" and her certainly never tells his audience that the way he wants them to draw ONLY works on toned paper that does all the heavy lifting and that it would be close to useless on white, or that his method would simply stop functioning without the subject's sitting in perfect portrait lighting, or that, if he is right, both Kaethe Kolwittz and J.A.D. Ingres, have a lot of explaining to do.<br /><br />Despite the above, I still found The Artist's Complete Guide to Drawing the Head a positive, and enlightening use of my time spent in the pursuit of draftsmanship.<br /><br />The book is a little long, and Maughan runs out of material about midway through, but his way of looking at things definitely works to create in the reader a different way of looking at the relationship of light and shadow on the human face but at the end of the day, Maughan is talking about a method of drawing and not *the* method.<br /><br />This book should be bought and used, but only in conjunction with other books that give the exact opposite advice that Maughan does.
B005LAII3A|5.0|Contrary to all the bad reviews, I thought this movie was great.  I loved the special effects; I thought the story line moved along well.  This was a great flick.

Where do I begin?<br />Well first, before somebody comments and whines, I am aware that \\"tarot\\" is not pronounced like taROT. :)<br /><br />This deck has been on my Amazon wishlist basically since it came out. It's surprisingly inexpensive for tarot cards (usually between ten and thirteen bucks here on Amazon), especially considering the card stock is incredibly thick, the box is sturdy and firm yet compact, the booklet (while small) is in color and the overall presentation of this deck is better than decks I have spent 5 times the money on. For example, I enjoy many Llewellyn decks but their packaging is absolutely useless and the cards are rather flimsy, and on top of all that they cost more than this deck.<br /><br />The main reason I put off buying these cards is because I don't like buying things I don't think I'll use. I love reading cards, I love zombies, but I didn't know how the combination would work out. I was so worried that the lighthearted nature of the cards (by the way, who would've though a deck full of brains and bodies could be anything less than terrifying or depressing?) would take away from my intuitive reading, but it actually has helped! These cards have given me some new insights and depths in the cards that I wouldn't normally see in a typical RWS deck. Seeing things through the eyes of a zombie or zombie slayer really changes your perspective!<br /><br />Now, the cards themselves:<br />As I said, the biggest reason I didn't get this deck even though I've wanted it for over a year now is because I doubted I would be able to use it for actual readings. Today I discovered that this deck definitely doesn't take itself too seriously, but it DOES give accurate readings. I found that the kitschy zombie artwork doesn't take away from the meanings, instead it makes it easier to turn a glum spread into something entertaining that'll make you smile. If you can relate your life to two zombies fighting over a man's leg it then things seem less awful! It doesn't seem to sugarcoat, but it isn't harsh by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />The cards ring pretty true to the typical RWS decks. The pentacles have been changed to hazards, which I don't really understand. All of the other suits are the same so it feels a little out of place. However, it doesn't really take away from the card meanings. The other suits retain their names but the representations are different. For example, Cups are represented by (mostly) brains, Swords are weaponry in general, and Wands are bones and limbs! I think that considering they changed the symbols but kept the names, they should have at least called the pentacles their alternative names, like coins or discs. Maybe even bullets?<br /><br />My main gripe that I have is that the backs are not reversible and there are no reversed definitions in the book. Sure, some people don't work with reversals but a lot of us do. This won't deter me from using the cards in reverse, and I'm not TOO bothered by knowing what direction a card is facing before I turn it, but it is still unfortunate.<br />Another small complaint is that while thick cards are good, these cards are a little stiff and they might be difficult to shuffle in smaller hands.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you are a card reader and/or someone who likes horror/zombies/50s-60s era art, you need this. It's so cheap and so worth it even if you don't read cards and just want to admire the art!em less awful!

B009UAO1ZG|2.0|Olsen writes from the POV of most in the literary field, that is, FDR has always proved right...wrong. A better way to approach the whys of Lindbergh is to have read Jim Powell's WILSON'S WAR or Thomas Flemming's THE ILLUSION OF VICTORY. I believe those two tomes would give a better &#34;back story&#34; on Lindbergh's beliefs. Olson is just another apologist for FDR, who I believe was the WORST president in USA history, closely followed by Woodrow Wilson.<br /><br />Lindbergh was a great man who understood why the men who founded the USA were willing to risk their&#34; lives, fortunes and sacred honor.&#34; FDR was just another politician who saw events as a means to vastly increase the power of government.
B00CUIVGZS|3.0|3 stars for the first 3 tracks, the rest is kinda wack. These days for the true fusion fans who still long for an era past 3 good tracks on a single CD is very good when most only offer one. Make music for your fans not yourself Chick......you got enough dry a$$ elevator music out there. Get down and stay down to the business of true Jazz Fusion. Still I applaud your effort.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This was not bad however not the best overall as compared to other films in this genre.  No academy awards but is a good watch.
0553381407|5.0|This book is an easy read and has helped me see clearly why I am the way that I am. It has challenged me to change, forgive, and be free from the controlling grip of my parents. It has also helped me to see my own mistakes in raising my child and lead me to change the perpetual unhealthy behavior towards my child

1781162646|5.0|It was good to read a mystery without page to page blood and gore ...... And yet it was still a good book. Hoe shocking!!!  We need more like this.  Too bad Mr. King and others don't use their remarkable talent like this more often. Although I am a huge fan, have read most of his books, this one was still a real treat. Would like to see more of the,.

B003G4W49C|4.0|I thought Ender's Game was a fantastic science fiction novel.  I knew nothing about the story line before reading except that there was a movie coming out and I wanted to read the book first.  I enjoyed the writing style and how the characters were developed and how the book moved along.  As the % of the book remaining kept decreasing I was literally reading into the wee hours to finish the book as I couldn't put it down.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies! Great directing. Great acting. One of Robert De Niro's best roles. Great Music as well.

B009IF8CH6|5.0|Great, like ever. Every geek in the world must see this show. Now I must buy all the season. Ah, the stream and quality are stunning.
B003TOH8AE|5.0|Hit Girl is the only reason to watch this movie. She is awesome with good support from Nicolas Cage. Who cares about the other actors or the plot for that matter?
B000JLSM00|5.0|This movie was based on a work discovered by the producer M.C. Cooper. It captures very well the history of post Civil War Texas.<br />Jeff Bezos is a descendant of the Jorgensen family which appears in the film. John Ford made his best westerns collaborating with Cooper. Cooper was the founder of the Polish Air Force which was instrumental in the defeat of the Russians in the 1920 war with Poland. He produced and directed King Kong and was one of Hollywood's most creative figures.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|Super human strength, super fast reflexs, and brilliant conversation skills? Not from this movie will I believe a Zombie threat is imminent or even possible. Brad Pitt made a &#34;grocery money&#34; movie. Too bad, as he a capable actor with potential as he ages. I regretably bought this movie and will not watch again. This movie in my opinion is a rent only and only as a last resort.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|I'm not a Woody Harrelson fan so I guess it's no surprise that I didn't like him in this. I just don't think the guy can act. The plot was fun and fast passed and the rest of the cast did a good job.
B001I1NI3Q|1.0|they sent me the wrong book, it is not the same book as described in the &#34;see inside&#34; now im stuck with a book i don't want. I wanted a chapter book, not a comic book.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I fell in love with dear Harold.  What a great story and I really enjoyed the way it was told.  As Harold walked to Queenie's bedside and his story unfolded I began to just sit back and enjoy the experience and Joyce's sentences.  She's a lovely writer with a gift for detail that transports the reader into the story.  Although Harold's story is difficult in places I thought his journey of transformation and redemption was awe inspiring and illustrates that we are never too old to redeem our past failings and discover forgiveness and restoration.
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|If you love numbers, this puzzle game is a great break from regular Sudoku!  Great stress relief for me!  If you don't enjoy figuring simple numbers,you probably won't love this game!
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Classic Jane Austin novel. Always enjoyable with story developing to a satisfactory conclusion. I definitely recommend this to any and all who enjoy a good love story.
B00BIPKROU|5.0|I avoided The Good Wife until the third season. I suppose it was the title that made me assume it was not for me, but I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />As with any good television series, the strength and appeal of the show are in the writing and character development, and The Good Wife gives us both in spades. Interesting legal cases, more interesting office politics, and even more interesting characters.<br /><br />The icing on the cake is the cast of opposing attorneys and judges that come back from time to time to offer excellent humorous relief.<br /><br />This is not a show that requires a half-season investment to decide whether it's worth continuing. I believe you'll know whether this show is for you in the first episode.
B000FC146C|5.0|What's not to like. A great  romance novel. well written. No sleaze.<br />But some weepy parts. But it is a great novel!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|After a while it just gets repetitive. It's enjoyable though so I liked reading it. The first book was better
B004LWZW24|5.0|I had heard of this movie but never saw it in theaters.  I tend to avoid horror movies as they are usually poorly made and lazily rely on \\"skeleton out of the closet\\" tactics or in other words, just loud sounds startling the viewer.  Cheap scares with no substance.<br /><br />Not this movie!<br /><br />From the very start of this movie, I new this one was different.  The blend of music and vague imagery in the starting credits really make you pay attention to the film and make you look closer at what you're seeing.  This movie does not rely on startling the watcher and only uses that tactic when needed.  This movie shows you something and after it passed you will think, \\"did I just see what I thought I saw?\\".  It is very creatively made and the atmosphere is menacing and thick.<br /><br />I thought about this movie well after it was done.  It not only is a great horror movie, but also a good movie in general.  Good acting, great dialogue, perfect pacing.  The movie gets going early on and does not let up.  I was extremely impressed with this film and recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />It seems to me that horror is one of the most difficult movies to produce as there seems to be so few quality titles.  I can name many action, drama, animated, comedy movies that I enjoy but horror not so much.  This is one of those rare gems that went under the radar.  I saw the Conjuring due to the same director, but that does not compare to Insidious.  They captured lightning with this film.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love this show. I recently started watching it and I can't get enough. I love the characters and their story lines.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|This game is so much fun!  It's fast paced so you can play a game or two in a a pinch. I find even the easiest level challenging. Gotta start playing it more!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Awesome app.....Awesome game....so fun and addicting! Everyone should download. I play every chance I get! I give it 2 thumbs up!!!

B009JZSC9S|5.0|I will continue to watch.  This season shows how she sees peoplle for who they really are  I am a very good fan.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Very enjoyable read. Good suspense throughout and kept guessing until the end.<br />I would recommend this book to my family members and friends in general.
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|Fell in love with the memes, the book takes it to a whole new level.if your a fan you'll love it.if your &#34;grumpy&#34;, well, you'll still love it. :)
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I started reading this as a borrowed e-book.  I decided to actually buy it because there was so much information I needed.  I am a sensitive introvert and in some ways have suffered for it.  When layoffs came during the recession I found out that I was one of the first to go because I was not \\"flashy\\" enough.  One other woman laid off  at that time (despite 10 years on the job) pointed out to me that it was those who quietly went around doing their job that were let go.  I now realize that the director making these decisions favored extroverts.  I now understand so many things about that kind of decision and how it relates to me.  This book points out the strengths of the introvert and how they may be undervalued  in this world of flashy people.  I also understand that I am sensitive and know why I can't enjoy the same violence in films that my husband seems to favor.  Simply, I understand myself better.  This would be a good read for anyone who dismiss introverts as less valuable.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This does what it says it is supposed to, the sound is nice and doesn't have any glitches.  What's not to like?
B002WV5A9G|5.0|What an awesome reboot of this series.  I had my doubts, but they did a great job on this.  I have watched it several times, and enjoy the characters and action every time.  I have read the complaints about JJ Abrams and lense flair and frankly don't get it.  I always enjoy his flicks.
B00B2PHSIY|3.0|It's nice to have the color back in my pictures, but the problem I have is bubbles get trapped between the camera and the snap on lens.  It's rather annoying.  I have a mask where my camera is attached, and I don't know the bubbles are there until I look at the photos later.  When it's too late to do anything about it.
B0047WJ12K|3.0|I know I know, this is the movie everyone loves.  Maybe I'm just dense, but I didn't just love this movie.  It was Okay and I would recommend for a friend to watch it, but it didn't sweep me off of my feet.
0756405890|5.0|I haven't been able to find a good fantasy book that holds my attention for almost 6 years. I really hate the badly written paranormal crap that is flooding the market, and I find a lot of well-known fantasy authors to be laborious and repetitive reads (ie. Sword of Truth series and Wheel of Time, for instance.) My friends picked this book for our first book-club meeting and everyone warned me that it was \\"slow paced\\" so I really didn't expect to enjoy it, but planned to muscle through anyway.<br /><br />Except... I fell in LOVE with the story and finished it in three days.<br /><br />Rothfuss captured me from the first page; his writing is lyrical and full of small beautiful details. Despite the slower pace, I couldn't put it down. Within every segment of the story there is a sense of mystery, a question begging to be answered, that keeps you turning the page. Rothfuss builds the world with intricate, painstaking detail so that one feels completely submerged in the setting. The best part is that the book takes the tried-and-true \\"hero story\\" to a more intense level. All of the great human themes are touched upon -- pride, folly, loss, grief, love, friendship, betrayal. All of this is done with a sense of intimacy--you come to know the main character as a three-dimensional person, and at the same time, you are reminded of lessons you have also learned over the course of your life. In a word, this book is excellent.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to fans of fantasy who are looking for a bit of a heavier, if beautifully crafted, read!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|So Jack Reacher is 6'3&#34; in the books (or something like that), so when I heard they cast Tom Cruise who is 5'6&#34; I was dismayed, but the movie was really good.  If you like a good action movie, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is really challenging because you have to really think quick for words, brain teaser that a lot of people should try
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I watched the movies before I read the books.  Took a few films, before I really got into it.  Now I watch them all of the time.  I recently read the books, which made me enjoy the movies even more.  Great job staying true to the books (considering the genre).  Can't wait to introduce this series to my children.
B00A136CUI|4.0|Really enjoy her voice.  Most of the songs are slow and set a great mood for relaxing. Only thing I haven't figured out is how to get to the digital booklet.
B00AO686MY|5.0|Bought this movie cause i had an old VHS copy that was starting to wear out because i love watching this movie. just like the VHS version but on dvd and with extras.
B000002MY3|5.0|Takes me back and lets me jam. There's songs on here that remind me of when i was younger. Oh, Alanis.
B00E8B1358|2.0|Very weak story if you even want to call it that.  The acting was very weak as well.  The kids enjoyed it, but that's not you expect from this movie.
B00049QQHI|5.0|This movie is one of the movies I suggest to any of my friends or people I know. I mean, Mark Whalberg and Leonard Dicaprio, when they were younger... ya can't beat that. Besides, it's based on a true story, which I also love, and it's damn good acting.
B00ANTX3HA|5.0|I was a teenager during the Vietnam war. The war ended in 1975. I was fifteen then and happy to have missed it. It was a total SNAFU. Agent Orange and Napalm don't smell like victory to me. The USA definitely lost the war. You can blame the Leftist bleeding heart Liberals at home or the dedicated and patient Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam. Even the autobiographer ( Robert McNamara ) bailed out of the Vietnam war. What a compelling story!
6302787068|5.0|Will always love this disney classic. Right up there with my many fav's. Also, good voice overs with good actors, and the enjoyable pixilated quality.

0316023744|5.0|The book is \\"The Second World War\\" and the author is Anthony Beevor. First of all, I have to tell you it was one hell of a read. I have had a long-running fascination with the World War II era. Watching the TV series \\"Victory at Sea\\" with my dad when I was a teenager, inspired me to join the U.S. Navy in 1955. From that time forward, I have read several autobiographies of war heroes on both sides, read history books on this era, and read fictional thrillers based on WWII.  Also there is no end to excellent movies set in that era.  \\"Patton\\" is one I never tire of watching. If a writer develops writer's block,  he/she can easily solve their problem by using the untold stories of this very special time.<br /><br />It was called World War II for a good reason, the entire world was affected by it, either  directly or indirectly. The total scope of the WWII is mind-boggling. It seems that no author was crazy enough to attempt telling the complete story of this epic period. No author, that is, until Anthony Beevor came along.  As he tells it, what he knew of the era seemed like a huge unfinished jigsaw puzzle. He was challenged to fill in the missing pieces and make it whole. He completed this epic work in slightly under 800 pages of text. In the book, he walks the reader ever forward through time as he geographically moves the reader  from battle ground to battle ground repeatedly circling the globe.<br /><br />You may be thinking now that these battle scenes must be highly compressed to all fit within 800 pages, perhaps to the point where the reading becomes dull.  You would be correct that the author has condensed the material economically, but not that it is ever dull. He provides detailed descriptions of the opposing armies, navies, air support, and often provides maps of the battles. But more than that, he makes each event a three- dimensional experience for the reader.  We become acquainted with the commanders in the field, and their relationships with their superiors. Indeed, these relationships extend all the way to the top, where presidents, prime ministers,  and dictators play at global chess. We learn how superior weapons determine outcomes. We see how failure to think ahead contributes to defeat. We see the blood and gore, hear the booming artillery, smell the rotting corpses, ache for a bite of food, or dream of an overdue bath to get rid of lice and filth. In other words, Beevor puts you in the middle of each battle as it actually was. If you have any romantic notions about warfare, this book may give you a new perspective.<br /><br />I would like to tell you that the pages fly by as you read this book. Sometimes that is true, but usually I felt tasked to absorb all that what is going on. The author did a marvelous job in making the episodes accurate, colorful, personal and realistic. Yet, these were complex events. The reader has to make an effort to process all the information being received. Thus, I found myself doing research with my Ipad to better understand the geography, personalities and action being described. I would read a few pages with my 2-3 cups of morning coffee each day. Weeks went by before I completed the book, yet I always looked forward to each new reading session. I think I learned a lot from reading  the book. I am still amazed that Beevor knew so much about this worldwide period of conflict. It read as though he had been at every event himself. By  now, you have probably decided whether you want to read Beevor's book.  If you do, i hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />Ralph D. Hermansen,  September 18.2013rs.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am about done with this Kindle book of &#34;A Feast for Crows: A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; - BK 4 - by George RR Martin and this is a review of how I feel the series of books has developed. This is one of the stronger reads in the series.  I feel Mr. Martin has settled into this series and this has developed the story in a stronger tale from the previous three.  The first three, though a wonderful set of books, don't seem to be as meaty as this book.  It lends itself well to the development of the story line and just seems to be better.  That's it! Looking forward to more of this series.  Oh, I paid $11 for this book and it is now offered for about 5$.  Hum.  .  .
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Realistic, but excellent movie about life, but you can still enjoy it with your popcorn!  I have given this for gifts.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|This is a must have movie for any Zombie fan.  No question about it.  Of course, if you're looking for a true interpretation of the book, this is not the movie for you.  That said,  the UV registration experience is terrible.  The Paramount website is down and continues to be down so I haven't been able to register my digital copy.  This is not a movie problem so I have to love it.  If I were only purchasing the digital copy, I would give it a one star rating.  Amazon started out as a book/DVD reseller so I think they should do some quality checking on the digital copy.  I purchased this on the release date so maybe the Paramount servers were overwhelmed and couldn't handle the traffic.  Let's hope that's the case.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! I use it o n my Kindle Fire HD all the time for quick calculations.  I recommend everyone should have it.  Clean clear display.
0064430227|5.0|this has quickly become the goto book for bedtime. the images are simple but inspiring and the story is just the right length
B000KIPT30|1.0|Item does not work, is now trash or paper weight and I should have listened to previous reviews.. This sux
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|the application is a good past time but I wouldn't play it for hours. just a little bit at time.
0449911357|4.0|I really enjoy thus book. I have read it previously and watched the movie. The screen play is good but differs a great deal from the book. Fannie Flag is funny and endearing. You can't read the book without loving the main characters. Humorous, tender and truthful perspective on life and race challenges, past and present.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Did not get to see most of the episodes due to work. It has been nice being able to see the first series and the actors as they get better especially Spock and Kirk.
B000035Z3K|5.0|In a seemingly endless string of Bela Lugosi movies, Dracula surpasses them all. I get chills each time that Dracula would give his next victim a smile and stare. Being a black and white movie added to the creepy elements of this classic. From the opening scene with the carriage full of passengers terrified of the mere mention of Dracula, to the dramatic death of evil, Bela Lugosi will thrill you, chill you and haunt your dreams. There are no exotic special effects such as accompany the newer crop of horror films, but that just adds to the eerie factor this film gives.
B0001ARCFA|3.0|The sound is clear and neutral. It is not too bass-heavy and not entirely treble-heavy. A small problem I had with these headphones were that they were not loud enough. If you are a slave to loud headphones then you are probably going invest in an amplifier in the future. A bigger problem I encountered was the detachable cord. In my experience, the headphone cord tends to fray in time after about 4-5 months regular use. All in all, these are great headphones when it involves sound quality (disregarding volume) but craftsmanship needs improvement.
B00873GRU4|4.0|original concept and a great dystopia novel that didn't need any zombies or aliens in it for it to be interesting..<br />good paced read, that i finished in two days, with great characters that have a distinctly normal feel about them, making them easy to relate to. I'm looking forward to the next one
B00CLD65X0|5.0|It keeps getting better and better. Can't wait for season four. Hopefully season four will bring peace for the family.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Each season gets better then the last. Can't put down. One of the best shows.  Love it! Great acting. Quality tv.
B00D2PIUAM|5.0|i have been Placebo's fan for over 10 years now, and let me tell you, nothing they do will ever be as great and fresh as the Black Market Music of 2000. Still ...&#34;Loud Like Love&#34; is a very interesting combination of Brian's madness and fantastic powerful music. It's been growing on me these past couple of days, the more i listen to it the more i like it. Placebo has evolved quite a bit after the previous drummer left the band, they have young energy of the new drummer flowing through and that's awesome. The lyrics...i don't know, it's up and down with Brian, and it get worse with his age. Overall, if you have never heard Placebo before you should definitely give it a try. For those like me reading this review, buy it and give yourself some time to get used to it, eventually you will start enjoying it:)) Cheers!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Funny movie, I love Seth rogen. This is not his &#34;normal&#34; type of humor but very funny, and a great Sunday afternoon watch :)
B00AEBB97S|5.0|Beautifully filmed, good acting, marvelous sets, great direction, and above all Grace Kelly, just watching her I feel great . . . I love just keeping the movie going, on and on . . .
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|Awesome game, Good story line.good graphics.  My only complaint-for 4.99 this is an extremely SHORT game. I spent my money unwisely.  For this reason I gave it 3 stars, otherwise I would have rated it a 5 star
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This is a great Angry Birds Star Wars sequel/prequel!  The graphics are amazing and the animation is outstanding! They have programmed it to display properly with whatever device you are using, tablets or cell phones, so it looks sweet no matter what you are playing on.  A lot of fun!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed this series as it reflected attitudes and moras of the times  historical facts followed and characters well developed so you had feelings for each. I reccd for all
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|The first season, in my opinion was the best. I got this for my Dad because I knew he would love it. He has since re-watched it, and re-subscribed to HBO so he could watch the other seasons.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|best alarm clock ive ever had i love the nature sounds lulling me to sleep an the fact you can download your own music to wake up to is awesome as well. i can also use it to remember things throughout the day because i can set several alarms in a day which is so great.overall i love it!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Even though we had the lowest price package for satellite TV we still did not watch it much - I think the commercials and re-runs were the downside to paying for television.... My husband saw this and read about and thought we should give a try. We have in the past hooked up our laptops to the TV and watched programs - but the downside was having to get up and pause it or wait for streaming - Oh we are lazy in our old age - but this handy little gadget lets you control everything (wirelessly) from the comfort of your chair. So we have only used it for a couple of days - but i'm thinking the satellite TV will be a thing of our past very soon. Highly recommend.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|A lot of people are complaining that season 2 falls short of season 1; that there is too much about the relationship between Brody and Carrie which gets in the way. I assert that season 1 lays the groundwork for how their relationship develops and becomes more complicated and troubled in season 2. Also, many aspects of the events that deal with the war on terrorism that are set forth in season 1 play out in season 2. The events of season 1 and 2 are intertwined and connected.<br /><br />I am not going to offer any \\"spoiler\\" comments here but the events in both seasons, especially season 2, are becoming all too familiar these days. This show is, of course, fiction but in a way is not. The last episode called \\"The Choice\\" leads us to believe that there may be a happy ending with respect to the relationship between Carrie and Brody but the horrors of terrorism get in the way. The finale is a visceral, intense and disturbing experience.<br /><br />But, with respect to the complaints about season 2, there may be a little too many \\"mushy\\" moments between the two protagonists. But, in an interview in the season 2 extras Danes says that these moments make the tone, at least for a while, be more \\"human.\\" I get that. Both seasons run through at a almost fevered pitch, somewhat like many episodes of my other favorite, \\"24.\\" But \\"24\\" also allowed Bauer to have some moments of his own, even though they were few.  They do not take away from the show but make the characters seem more real.<br /><br />The writing as in season 1 is brilliant. I am especially moved by how Danes portrays bi-polar disease. She must have looked into the issue or been around people who know what it is like to be bi-polar; to have episodes that can be manic at one time and suddenly become depressive. As someone who has dealt with this problem it is wonderful and also a little scary to witness by Danes' astonishing acting how the disease can over, even consume, one's personality. Her bi-polar moments werealmost like a mirror. Maybe not that extreme but a mirror nonetheless.<br /><br />I have to add the the casting is brilliant. Having Mandy Patinkin as Saul who becomes Carrie's father-figure is wonderful. He is such a great actor and I am glad he took on this part. His somewhat world-weary tone is unmistakable. Also how he respects and is confused and frustrated by Carrie's behavior is  great.  Nobody else could have played Saul. Watch for his very moving prayer, in Jewish, at the end. You don't need to understand the words to realize what his prayer is about. Why he is praying becomes evident. I loved that brief moment in the finale.<br /><br />One of the actor in the show that nobody talks about is Morgan Saylor who plays Brody's 16 year old daughter. I am always amazed how film and TV shows can find really great kid actors. Saylor is excellent. She acts like a typical teenager but her character also calls for depth and sensitivity and Saylor does quite well. Check out her reactions to her father's actions in the show's finale and you will see what I mean.<br /><br />A TV critic for the New Yorker said that Homeland is the best show on TV. I could not agree more<br /><br />So, if you love season one 1 cannot afford to miss season 2.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great alarm clock. I can't believe it's free with all the options, sounds, ways to make sure you're up (I love that I can choose that I have to solve a math problem before dismissing the alarm if desired). Easy to use-I use it for every morning!
B00F35BV64|4.0|Star Trek Into Darkness was an entertaining, fun sci-fi romp. It's only real drawback is that it was very much one for &#34;everyone else&#34;. If you are a fan of the Star Trek franchise you can't help but notice how heavily this film leans on &#34;The Wrath of Khan&#34; without adding much new to the Star Trek canon.

1451627297|4.0|Though this book was OBSCENELY LONG (over 800 pages!), I could NOT PUT IT DOWN, once I started reading it (its the FIRST Stephan King work, I have ever read cover-to-cover!). It was an awesome read, with LOTS of \\"human interest sub-plots\\", and will make for an EXCELLENT MINI-SERIES (too much information in this book that needs to stay in it for a decent movie!). The overall message of the \\"time-travel\\" result is that: if you mess with the past, you CAN REALLY SCREW UP the future (as poor Jake finds out at the end, and that he has to do a FINAL \\"re-set\\"!). The book is a lot like Deane Koontz's \\"Lightning\\", although that level of \\"time-travel\\" was on a 'slightly\\" non-alterable scale! I can't wait for the movie/mini-series on this book to come out! Whenever it does, I sure hope it remains true to the book-even the horrific, gruesome details!

1932100660|5.0|The China Study startled me. Yes, I expected a research-based case for a diet consumed by Chinese citizens which resulted in health benefits not found in the western diet. What struck me was the degree of outcome differences between the two diets. Authors T. Colin Campbell and Thomas M. Campbell, MD caught my attention.<br />  Dt. T. Colin Campbell is director of The China Study, begun in 1983.  Dr. Campbell's focus is the superiority of plant-based foods over animal-based foods, including all types of meats, dairy, and eggs, for greatest health benefits. This preferred diet is not only an important prevention of serious illness, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and others, but serves as well as a healing remedy for those illnesses.<br />  The research and scientific experimentation supporting Drs. Campbell's position is impressive.  Human studies of 800 women from 170 villages in China and Taiwan and a 27 year laboratory research program of experimental animal studies funded by the National Institutes of Health in the late 60's laid the groundwork for his project.<br />  The China Study is not a fad diet. It is not a quick fix to slim down before your college reunion. Its purpose and message is serious, and life-saving.<br />  Review by Elaine Tabor

B0000041LA|5.0|These 5 concertos exemplify the dynamic style of other Russian composers. They have many of the qualities of Rachmaninoff's works, but without the melodious passages.  Nevertheless, I was very pleased with them and would recommend them without reservation.  The quality of the pianist's technique is outstanding.

B00EZE85WM|5.0|This is an excellent bundle of RLS's novels, novellas, and short stories. In fact, according to the blurb in the Kindle Store, \\"this collection comprises all the fiction Stevenson ever published.\\" I cannot confirm the veracity of \\"all\\" and \\"ever,\\" but this set contains the titles I had expected to find, plus a few pleasant surprises. It is handsomely formatted, and the content is easily accessible via a detailed, but particularly user-friendly, active TOC (though for some reason \\"The Dynamiter\\" is listed twice with two different publishing dates). And the price (at a mere $.99) is certainly great for so much content.<br /><br />But that content is NOT as \\"complete\\" as both titles -- the one on the cover (\\"Complete R.L. Stevenson\\") and the one in the Kindle Store listing (\\"The Complete Collection of R.L. Stevenson\\") -- might lead you to believe. This set is NOT complete with regard to the totality of his creative output; it contains none of his poetry (such as his well-known \\"A Child's Garden of Verses\\") nor any of his travel writing, essays, etc. So while the explanatory note clearly states this is complete only insofar as his fiction is concerned, there is no good reason why the title(s) shouldn't be equally as forthright (as in simply and more truthfully: \\"The Complete Fiction of RLS\\").<br /><br />FYI: A (virtually) truly complete set appears in the Kindle Store by Delphi for $2.99, but like most Delphi collections, it provides much obscure material and various supplements that are of primary interest only to die-hard students of the author. That memory-usurping set is not for me at the present time.<br /><br />The misleading title(s) aside, this is a fine collection and is well worth the low price. It is everything I had hoped it would be, and I am VERY happy with it.

B005OT2YVA|5.0|Its not the best quality when watched on HD because the connection in some point loses it but over all was the best to watch it on HD if you are watching it online but I really do love the movie and its GREAT!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Well when fighting these monsters  and in my hand is all these sludge  hammers swinging from left to right  and all around  killing those monsters.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This is a lot of fun, I really did not think it was going to be.. reminds me of Diablo 3. I'll recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this everyday. I don't go a day without paying it. I love the up up dates u give all the time. Thank you.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Great music skillfully done!  I am a big fan of Adele and feared that I might be disappointed with a live recording.  This program is all that I wanted or expected!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The device stopped working with Netflix and Google team can't even fix the issue, neither can Netflix team. Keep away from it, apple TV is far better. The price diff may be high but that is the difference between quality and cheap products.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Good job.  While it is not as enthralling and thrilling as the stage play, this is an outstanding production and was very well done.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I am never disappointed with Jodi Picoult!  The characters, the details, the plots!  Will read more of her books for sure
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Good read! Funny, passionate and great to hear from a mans perspective through a female author! A must feel good must read!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|hugh laurie never ceases to amaze me.  I have been a fan of his since his first episode of House  his music just makes me smile because I see his face with every note
0007466064|5.0|Once you start down the Game of Thrones storyline, you can't help but be interested and involved . . . and addicted.  Read the 1st 4 books faster than I ever imagined and could hardly wait until this arrived.  Good continuation of the story and even more addicted than I would have ever believed.
0679809015|1.0|I don't know who this product is for.  It's tiny (like 3.5&#34;-square tiny).  The flaps are too small and delicate for my one-year-old to grasp and move.  I loved the concept, but this just isn't useful.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|A must read. Entertaining but have your tissues ready. Full of romance, fun, sadness and characters full of life. I would recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it's so cool with servers or just playing with friends<br /><br />I think that  anyone 8 to 15 would LOVE THIS APP.<br /><br />Minecraft  is the best app ever no lie.<br /><br />So fun playing on your own or playing with friends. The point is<br /><br />Minecraft pocket edition is the BEST APP EVER SINCE Angry birds
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|The game is awesome but what I thought was weird was it came out on the 18 when it was soposd to come on the 19
B00BIPCY14|5.0|I started watching The Good Wife because I was bored on day and it popped up in my recommendations. I wasn't expecting much, and honestly, the first episode wasn't so great. But I decided to keep going as a lot of shows I love had slow starts. Now a couple weeks later I'm on season 3 and am hooked. The acting and character development has definitely evolved and improved, and while the characters would be considered &#34;the other half&#34; - they are relatable and feel relevant.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Simply a great movie, full of action and a good story. I can not wait to watch this with my children.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|&#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34; is one of the best series ever, whether on regular broadcast TV, cable or the premium channels.  We've loved every season and this season was one of the best.  The acting is incredibly good (especially Charlie Hunnaman, the awesome Katy Sagal, and a terrific Ron Perlman), the writing is superb, and the production is top notch!  Really, a &#34;must see&#34;!  And anyone criticizing the choice of Charlie Hunnaman for &#34;Fity Shades of Grey&#34; just has not seen this guy act---not only as handsome as Brad Pitt ever was, but he's one of the best actors on any TV series.  Really, just give it a shot----one episode will have you hooked!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A shorter story by Gaiman.  I enjoy all of his works and was very pleased with this story.  It's shorter than I anticipated but it was still a great read.  Kept me turning pages with anticipation.  Would recommend this story to anyone looking for an escape from reality and in need of a &#34;jump start&#34; to their imagination!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Very well done cinematic recreation of the Comic book.  All the Mega City goodness without the Campyness of the 90's version.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Suits is a witty and smart drama that has you guessing and laughing every episode.  I Love watching Suits and can't wait for future seasons.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great opening season!  My wife and I were hooked on &#34;Suits&#34; from the pilot episode.  The characters and plots developed very quickly in season 1.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I loved this book, it kept me on the edge of my seat as it weaves here and there. It has an interesting ending and I was sad to finish it. I will be reading a lot more of this author's work.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I absolutely love this show because it has wonderful characters, a good storyline, it makes me laugh and cry all without sex, gore and sensationalism which so many shows have nowadays just to get big ratings. Give me shows like this anyday!
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|I really like this app; I would recommend it to people who are willing to have an open mind and truly touch base with themselves as well as open up their heart.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent biography!!  I couldn't put it down!  Steve Jobs was a remarkable and fascinating man.  Walter Isaacson created yet another masterpiece by capturing the essence of a very complicated individual.  His research is impeccable  and his writing style makes the story unfold seamlessly.  Jobs would have been pleased.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I was just browsing through the available shows on Amazon Prime when I came across this show and decided to give it a look. I was hooked very quickly and watched every episode within a very short time. I had never watched an MTV show however was pleasantly surprised with how I enjoyed this angst ridden show with its comedic slant on some adult &#34;ish&#34; situations that our young adults go through on a daily basis.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Mike Matthews is down to earth and straightforward in his book.  If you feel lost in the &#34;try the latest move&#34; or &#34;try the latest supplement&#34; twilight zone, look to Mike for clarity.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is a lot tamer than their last few, though it sounds as though these songs have had a lot more time and effort put into them. Very quality album.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I am only a fifth of the way through so far, but I am hooked. This is one of Philippa Gregory's best books. I have read most of the Cousin's War series (out of order) as well as the Tudor books.
B0092SQBJA|5.0|Listen to this. Just listen to it. Stop reading the comments and listen to it. Don't care what other people think, make your own choices. Just play all the samples and enjoy. Plus you can't beat the price. I got some odd MP3 credit from Amazon when they had trouble getting me my download in time due to traffic or something and had to spend it quickly, and I found these guys by chance. I am so glad I did, I went and bought their other one, Tourist History, which is also dipped in excellence and sprinkled with hellyeah. Why are you still reading this? I told you to stop and go listen to them. You must be some kind of rebel. I like that about you.
B00F2362IE|3.0|This game is a cool concept,l but still runs slow on the Kindle in my opinion.  Games for this platforms need to be simple.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|We enjoy the characters, plots and twists. It takes a good actor to make me dislike them. There are several in this program.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I originally got this app because I thought that I could also learn chording from it.  Turns out that's not the case, but it's still a cute little amusement.  &#34;Playing&#34; the songs in the app is a pain, as the keyboard has to shift right and/or left, which ruins the timing.  I don't use it nearly as much as I thought I would.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love everything about it. for a free game it couldn't be better. if you love puzzles, you'll love this game.
B00AO2TREY|5.0|This CD is in constant rotation in my car. I can't stop playing it. The music is so nuanced and rich.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved all the twists and turns in the book and a great unpredictable ending. I highly recommend this book.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Monkey Boxing?  Come on, right?  But, after trying it, I find that I like it.  It's certainly not a strategy game, but it is fun.  Watching the monkeys duke it out is amusing, and the animation is well-done.  The actions seem somewhat random -- you can land 20 punches in a row, and then with no change in your timing the other monkey starts beating your monkey up.  But, I've played over 20 matches now and I don't have any bruises (and my monkey hasn't complained once) so it's all in good fun.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviews that it would be nice if occasionally an opponent had a &quot;signature move&quot;, like a roundhouse, or uppercut, and the game announced it.  Maybe in your training you could also acquire the specialty punch.<br /><br />But, even with no changes I'll come back to this game occasionally for a few minutes of fun.  I certainly won't play it where strangers would see me -- you tend to get caught up in the bouts, especially when a challenge pops up and you have to spin a disk as fast as possible to make your monkey out-slap your opponent...<br /><br />Full disclosure, I got this as the FAOTD.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Good show! Interesting, captivating storyline. Touch of realistic situations vamped with drama kept my interest. Looking forward to catching up on all seasons.
B00CCKWUNG|5.0|Love the movie.  Love all the options to view it as well.  Blu-ray at home, DVD for the portable player.  Will watch over & over.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I loved this on the PC, and was pleasently surprised to see it available for the Kindle Fire. Plays well, reacts like you're playing on a real table. Fantastic! 2 thumbs up!
B00BKU9ZFU|3.0|I have listened frequently for the last three weeks before stating my opinion of this recording.<br />Cecile is a remarkable jazz singer with a fantastic range and a great sense of time and rhythm.<br />She can do just about anything she wishes to do and does so on this album. St. Louis Gal is perfect as is the remarkable &#34;Lull In My Life.&#34;  &#34;John Henry&#34;  is a unique treatment and works well with Herlin Riley on drums. Throughout the recording of all the selections Riley is essential and in perfect sync with Salvant. &#34;Le Front Cache Sur Tes Genoux&#34; is expressed in French in requires repeated listening but well worth it.What bothers me is her choices of &#34;Moonlight&#34; and &#34;Savage&#34; as well as &#34;Woman Child&#34; all of which leave me completely turned off. She simply does more than she needs to do to prove she is a remarkable talent and I look for her next recording. I hope she keeps recording with Aaron Diehl on piano and Riley on drums. They are five star companions in this endeavor.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A truly wonderful story.<br />Sad but joyous , very well done.<br />This last book has made me want to read them all again.<br />It does not get any better than that.
B0071UF9TE|4.0|Very well done, and interesting, a must for any Rolling Stones fan interested in the story and personalities behind the music!
B003W0BYQ4|4.0|Great old western film. Classic John Wayne and Deano makes the perfect washed up drunk. Rickie Nelson is a bit stiff and his role and didn't fit many of the scenes.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|I use this App when I'm away from my desktop to help family members or friends with computer issues. the app connects well and I am able to remote in easily take control of their computer. I also use it to connect to my desktop if I need to check or transfer a files to my Kindle HD fire.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The story was excellent. The way the story was planned out is marvelous. The story was amazing and very addicting.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|.......if your budget can handle it! I can't add any more superlatives about the music than the other reviewers have already, except that the book-type package again puts the GRATEFUL DEAD ahead of the pack.  The limited edition deluxe version comes in a STURDY slipcase with another beautiful tie-die pattern, and a has a great 40 page booklet with essays about the history of this long cherished show and what it took to do it right for release.  The band held back releasing the concert until they could strike a deal with the film's producer, and while everyone's grumbled for years about it's unavailability, it was well worth the wait.  The limited deluxe edition's DVD or Blu-Ray contains the 40 minute documentary shown prior to the film at the debut screenings all around the country on August 1, 2013. It's great to see all the living participants compared to their youthful selves, man, are we getting old or what? If you have the $$$ the Blu-Ray is the way to go, the 1080p picture and loss-less audio are stunning! Now what we need next is the Belgian TV concert and hour long Bremen Beat Club performance (both exist) from the '72 tour on DVD and Blu-Ray.  What about it boys??????<br /><br />I just want to add for the customer thinking of purchasing this that the whole concert is NOT on the DVD.  The movie would have had to be over three hours long! The film is a documentary about the concert, and all the DEAD's performances are uncut (including the transcendent 30 min. \\"Dark Star\\" journey).  The picture and sound are terrific considering their age, but has there ever been an official GRATEFUL DEAD release that hasn't been top notch?  I just don't want to see poor reviews saying \\"...but the whole concert wasn't on the DVD, bummer...\\"  Here's a list of the UNCUT performances:<br /><br />PROMISED LAND<br />CHINA CAT SUNFLOWER><br />I KNOW YOU RIDER<br />JACK STRAW<br />BIRD SONG<br />DARK STAR><br />EL PASO<br />SING ME BACK HOME<br />GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD (End Credits))
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Great game!<br /><br />Good music and flow of the game. You will be spending time in this one.<br /><br />Cons<br />Can't draw lines to the border of screen so dots can slide through and get stuck.there is no zoom for the fine drawing of lines
0811879542|5.0|This is a wonderful interactive, giggle through type book.  I bought it for a one year old &#34;to grow into&#34; because I love the bright colors and shapes and very simple instructions.  However, the two older girls (3 and 5) have become the keepers of the book and &#34;read&#34; it to the baby.  They are all thrilled.  I bought several of Tullet's books.  He has become my favorite children's author.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best show ever!! Love everything about it, and could keep watching it over and over again! Worth the purchase! Woot!
B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|King Samuel Benson will blow your mind with this one! My niece read the last page with me, and she has taken it to start from the beginning. Really very funny stories and with lessons, too! This is definitely an author worth watching. Five full stars for this one!
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|I love it... been listening to it non-stop. I love the choral style background singing, electronic beats and the sad but hopeful lead vocals. Buy it!
B000HL2J0G|5.0|This TV show did change our language. Once this show got going the term for jerry-rigging and improvising to fix or repair something around the house or car became known as MacGuyvering it: When you tell someone that you MacGyvered it they know what you mean.  I think it also helped to popularize the Swiss Army Knife; MacGyver did almost everything with that knife.<br /><br />This was a very popular series when it was on TV years ago. My family enjoyed it then, so I was very pleased to see it on Amazon Prime. My wife and I are enjoying it now again too. We watch MacGyver, and other Amazon Prime TV shows & movies, whenever there are no programs on network TV we don't care to watch, which seems to happen more than it should.<br />Ed Halpaus
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I love One Republic and this CD did not disappoint. I would highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys good music.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|fast delivery!great quality!!!!!love the movie!!!was never a fan of original star trek series,,but this movie got me!!!now i want to know everything about star trek!!!
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|Should have been titled &#34;dysfunctional person hikes w.o. prep&#34; . Strayed was unlikeable, morally lacking and totally self- absorbed. Her hike was to be her epiphany but there was nothing to suggest enlightenment. What occurred to change her into an admirable person whose book for which we should shell out good money?
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A good creditable read! How can you argue with the possibility of an after life when experienced by an MD who's a neurological specialist.  He was able to debunk all those theories that its your brain just feeding you what you want to see/hear.  This guy was OUT!  Could have used a little more detail with some of the experiences.......you could tell they were so over-powering an sensory that even he was at a loss for words.....which in and of itself paints a picture.  Gave me great hope and fed my faith.  You need it in this world today!
B009JZORSI|4.0|A little cheesy at times, but funny and entertaining.  Definitely one of the best of the original cast movies.  Very kid friendly as well.  I.E. no violence, adult situations, etc...
B005C0DHEY|1.0|This movie is nothing but propaganda and lies. Explain to me how natural gas that has sat under the earth for millions of years and never crept into the groundwater will suddenly rise thousands of feet to seep into the ground water once it is tapped? Just think about it.<br /><br />When you have to sue someone to hide facts, that is not only unethical but dirty. Josh Fox did just that. He was exposed. Phelim McAleer asked Josh Fox why he chose to leave out facts from the Colorado Division of Water about the methane in water that existed long long before hydraulic fracturing (which has been going on since the 1950's). The answer: \\"they were not relevant\\". Someone posted on YouTube the facts Josh Fox was trying to hide, but being an environmentalist and therefore an enemy of science, he sued so that YouTube would take down the video. He didn't counter with a debate, he silenced. Where I come from, when you try to silence someone it means you have something to hide.<br /><br />But don't take my word for it. Don't take anyone's word for it. Be an enemy of environmentalists and ask the most important question: \\"Where is your raw data as required by the scientific method?\\" Albert Einstein said it only takes one to prove him wrong. Science is not by consensus, but by dissent.<br />[...]
B009EHDU7U|5.0|I just loved this book for its craziness and improbability.  It was fun, and you never knew where it was going next.  It reminded me of Stieg Larsen - written by a real story teller.  I have told my friends to read it.  A rollicking good read with a crazy crazy touch.
B002VRZEYM|3.0|This documentary contains some important facts about our food production, but unfortunately is comes across as a anti-Monsanto propaganda piece. After watching Food, Inc, I asked two farmers I know well about Monsanto. Both of them thought Monsanto was the best thing for farmers since the tractor. Every farmer I've met since then I also asked about Monsanto and none of them had a negative opinion of Monsanto. So who do I believe? Farmers I know who use Monsanto products? Or people filming a documentary?<br /><br />No more calls please, we have a winner.<br /><br />After talking to my farmer friends, I began to research Monsanto some. Generally I found out they were acting like every other big publicly traded corporation. So why do the environmentalists consider Monsanto more evil than Satan? And more evil than, say, Apple or Microsoft or Bank of America or Comcast. I don't know why.<br /><br />In any event, after talking to my farmer friends, I decided this film was really propaganda and not a documentary. If you strip out the anti-Monsanto part, it does make some excellent points. I recommend you watch this film, but realize the Monsanto parts are half-truths and should be ignored. The parts about animals are spot-on.<br /><br />We also need to remember that Round Up does not take nutrients out of plants nor does it harm us. Organic is not safer. Things that make our food grow faster take nutrients out of food and harm us. But not pesticides. Consumer Reports said that.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A good read, and I didn't really want it to finish, but I didn't like the ending much.  That said, I will read her other books
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|After purchasing and downloading it keeps saying that I dont own the app, so I guess I didnt own the 99c either.<br /><br />Galaxy S4 is what im using btw.
B00EEN7CAK|5.0|a breezy ride to the pen for a few bored, materialistic teens without scruples, conscience or morality.  its a grim snapshot into a certain style of life led by mall queens.  the scenes were entirely predictable as was the ending:  the jig's up.
0547884591|5.0|This book isn't just about cooking.  It's about structuring learning so it's most effective, and it also happens to apply to cooking.  I highly recommend this book!
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|I wrote off this series when I first heard of it thinking it was a dumb cashing. Turns out this is one of the most intelligent series created. Everything from the intelligent dialogue, moody atmosphere, shocking visuals, layered sound design and well fleshed out characters make this the series you need to pick up next. This could be the best series after The Wire and Dexter. Well, provided they don't screw up the later seasons like *shudder* Dexter did.<br /><br />5/5 stars!
B000003CMB|5.0|When this concert was released on LP it was one of the first \\"live\\" albums ever.  In over 42 years there haven't been many \\"live\\" albums that can match it.  \\"Southern Rock\\" was born with the Allman Brothers Band and many bands followed them (and tried to imitate them but couldn't).  Sadly in seven months from the date of these recordings, Duane Allman would be gone from a motorcycle accident.  Approximately one year later Berry Oakley would be gone from a motorcycle accident.  Sky Dog lives on this recording and always will.
1616550414|5.0|Excellent book!!!! Warning; 1/3rd is about Skyward Sword. The illustrations are beautifuk, and it gave you answers to questions you've had forever.
1594203334|4.0|This was a great book.  I think how French parents are raising their children is definitely how I want to raise my children: to eat all foods, be able to play independently and sleep well among other things.  There may be a difference between French and American parenting right now but I bet it's because of the attitude of the generations.  Our grandparents were probably a lot like French parents today.<br /><br />\\"Unlocking Generational Codes\\" by Anna Liotta discusses the four generation types that have rotated throughout history.  I don't know if that applies to other countries, but could it be possible French parents are just  in a different generation type then American parentsright now?  If so then we are raising children that will probably be more like our grandparents/great-grandparents and French parents today.  I mention this because though Druckerman has some great insight to parenting and raising well-mannered children, I don't think American parents will be like how Druckerman portrays them forever nor do I think French parents will always raise their children how they do now.  Each of the four generation types raise their children differently according their unique traits and characteristics.
B004P7CMUU|4.0|I can't say I was fascinated, but I must say I ended the movie thinking, &#34;You deserve what you got.&#34;  This man was a relative of mine. One thing that I appreciated was the fact that the person who scripted the film was generous enough to disguise the details so no one could recognize which member it was.  We have a lot of folks in our family who do the same thing.  They always end up badly.<br />Bonita Evans, Ph.D.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|This movie started off like a roller coaster ride and and kept going till the very end. Good story line, good acting, good effects. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Really enjoyed this movie. Not so much about the zombies but how they were dealt with. Great show!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I knew who Steve Jobs was and was aware that he was &#34;special.&#34;  However, after reading this book, I only wish I could have been one of the &#34;cult&#34; that waited with baited breath for his &#34;Apple's&#34; next best creation.  Jobs apparently never let his creativity take a break.  He was the power behind the throne.  He pushed his &#34;A&#34;team to utter perfection while at the same time coming down on them and anyone who faced him with the force of a tornado.  He almost never thought he was wrong.  He wasn't very kind.  He was a tempestuous bully.  He lacked the empathy gene.  He was &#34; so smart&#34;, he didn't follow the only course that might have saved him from an early death from cancer.  The author tells a very detailed story about Steve Jobs humble beginnings as the adopted son of Paul Jobs and takes you through Jobs partnering with that other genius, &#34;Woz,&#34; and explains in vivid detail how these two changed the world.
B000TDGGVU|4.0|Fluent writing with strong arguments showing the need for reconsideration of personal values and modus vivendi. It should contain a chapter for what is happening outside USA.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|This was a great read!! I have gotten hooked on this series. I received this on my kindle fire and within two days I had it finished.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I am struggling to finish.  If it wasn't for the fact that my Book Club chose this, I would have bailed by page 4.  I have trouble keeping the characters straight, and am really over teen books.  Book Club, you are not allowed to chose books anymore.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is for every one who likes horses this game is completely worth the wait of downloading because this game is the most real life game that I have found.

B008BM9L72|5.0|I had said to friends and family I would never read any of these books after I heard it was all filth. But my youngest 23yrs said mum u read the story and its great.<br />So I did and I couldn't put them down they are the best.

B00BRUPICM|3.0|When a book comes along with rave reviews and a prestigious award attached, I tend to feel I'm almost obligated to love it. But that didn't work in this case. (In reality, it's never a sure thing.)<br /><br />Alex tells the tale in alternating chapters of a beautiful young woman kidnapped on the streets of Paris and the brilliant police commandant who sets out to find her. However, the novel is a lot more than a straightforward police procedural that ends in a successful, last-minute release of the battered captive. Instead, it's a story of several extremely unusual people with over-the-top behavior that you or I are unlikely ever to encounter in the real world.<br /><br />Alex, the kidnapped young woman who gives her name to the title, is a piece of work, and I do not mean this as a compliment. Just how much of a piece of work becomes clear as the story unfolds. The police commandant, Camille Verhoeven, is just as strange. The author repeatedly refers to him as a dwarf, although his height, four feet eleven, is at the outside limit of the definition. Tormented as a youngster, Verhoeven carries with him all the baggage of resentment, including a volcanic temper and a combativeness that's ill suited for a senior police officer. His sidekicks, Armand and Louis, are both cartoon-like as well. Armand \\"borrows\\" and snitches everything in sight, never paying for a thing himself. Louis is fabulously wealthy and appears to have two or three PhDs, since he is prone to launch into a lengthy discourse at the drop of an obscure fact.<br /><br />I'll say this much for Alex: the book held my attention to the last. I might add that the snippet from the Daily Mail review that appears on the cover -- \\"Diabolical!\\" -- is most certainly true.
B008602KQI|4.0|An engaging story of a future world supported by a great cast, especially Jennifer Lawrence, who plays the lead character, Catniss. Based on series of  popular young adult books, the movie provides great imagery in support of a well-written story.
B000EQHHJW|4.0|I thought it was going to be a video of a stage production, but it turned out to be a video production proper.  There were oddly-edited sequences, and the Foley work was really obvious. Oh, and the extreme close-ups of Pavarotti and other principals were disconcerting.  But I understood better after reading the liner notes from the director, that this was meant to be a video work. I purchased this because I was performing in the chorus of a production of this opera and wanted to watch the chorus. I was somewhat disappointed that the chorus shots were a little scanty.<br />But overall, I like the video because, hey! it's Pavarotti!
B003XT60KO|5.0|Clearly explains the most fundamental principles of basic economics. Double-entry bookkeeping rules apply. A dollar in the debit column must be offset by a dollar in the credit column. Be aware of the impact on all groups, both short- and long-term.<br /><br />Written in the 1940s and revised in the 1970s, this volume gave me a clear perspective of the economic impact of political actions since the early 20th century.  In short, just about every economic move by government has been wrong, ill-advised and leading to economic ruin.<br /><br />We could do with a lot less \\"fine-tuning\\" and a lot more \\"back-to-basics.\\" I suspect, though, that we're far beyond the tipping point. Sadly, there's no place left to colonize and reboot.<br /><br />DK 09/18/2013
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|A very original story. (most disney stories are about a child being separated from his/her parents) My 13 year old still loves this one.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|The combination of Spock, Kirk, *and* Bones is what makes this shine. It's a bit overacted at parts, but the thoughts it brings up, the quotes that they quote are always what I think about while watching it. Though provoking.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I absolutely love this game and try to play at least a few games every day.<br /><br />I've got it on my iPhone, which has much quicker updates. However, my Kindle Fire tablet edition is always much slower to update. For instance, I've been playing the Moscow game on my iPhone but my Kindle Fire tablet version is still in China.<br /><br />Fun game but I wish they'd update sooner. I like playing the game in all the different cities.
B002PWB7C6|4.0|Michael Mann's return to the classic creation of the late 80's, &#34;Miami Vice&#34;, brings back characters from the original (Sonny Crockett, Ricardo Tubbs, Gina Calabrese, Trudy Joplin, Larry Zito, Stan Switek, and Lieutenant Castillo.  However, that's pretty much where the similarities end from the original.  Gone is the ground breaking music helmed by Jan Hammer - which greatly set the tone of the stories from the classic series.  That said, common elements remain as go-fast boats (cigarette boats), a Ferrari, and planes remain keynote means of travel by the main characters, and the plot is driven by the character's covers having strong impact on the original reason for the characters going undercover to begin with.  So, while different, there are enough common themes that make this &#34;Miami Vice&#34; feel close enough to the original (they even through in &#34;In The Air Tonight&#34; originally covered by Phil Collins - this time covered by Nonpoint) that those that grew-up watching the original series will follow Michael Mann's unique storytelling style.  Those that are not familiar with the original will enjoy this film as it is a traditional &#34;tent pole&#34; film in that there is a lot of action sequences, explosions, and fast paced sequences that summer blockbusters tout.  Just my two cents worth!
B00CE5C8RW|2.0|Let me keep this review simple.<br /><br />This watch worked for two hours!!<br /><br />What a joke why even make a product like this!<br /><br />I am not returning it I am throwing it out.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good basic game with some visual and game choices. I like the &#34;undo&#34; option when you hit the deck twice by accident!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Like the first three series, this one continues to hold interest with plot twists and appealing characters.  Keep up the good work!
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|A must have for kids of all ages.  Parents ca reminisce and younger kids can be introduced to what Disney can truly be.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Fabulous new show.  Can't wait for Season 2!  Well acted by all.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Star Trek Into Darkness brings us a kind nod to Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan, just without Kirk's son, the planet Genesis, or the death of Spock.  Of course, those that are not familiar with the original Trek films will not necessarily follow what I am referring to, which is fine as this film stands on its own.  Personally, my favorite part is the cameo of Lenard Nimoy reprising his role of Spock (or Spock Prime for those that recall the title credits from the previous film).  While I did see Lenard Nimoy's name in the credits of this film, I was disappointed that they did not tie his name to the character he portrayed, ah well.  The story's opening is a little confusing with the Enterprise being hidden in the ocean of an M Class planet.  The problem that is created is Kirk taking the ship out of the ocean and the planet's inhabitants witnessing the Enterprise leaving the ocean in an endeavor to rescue Spock.  My issue with this is, how would the inhabitants not see the Enterprise leaving the ocean, even if he had not gone after Spock.  At any rate, I get that the story needed a vehicle to have Kirk (temporarily) removed from being captain of the Enterprise to drive the story.  From there the story switches to the introduction of Khan and the start of his mission against the Federation.  Without giving away the details, the &#34;good&#34; guys win the day but instead of Khan meeting a gruesome end as in &#34;Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan&#34;, this Khan is stuck in a cryogenic tube and put into storage along with his crew.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Very entertaining, clever and addictive. I cannot wait for the new one. I heard the fall, then Jan last year, still not here.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|This is one of the better escape games. It was fun. I hope they do more. I love having a hint though. It really helps when I get stuck!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Very well done.<br />I really enjoyed watching this movie.  I saw it in the theatre but wanted to watch it for the second time.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Reconnect with what Disney is really about with this truly amazing animated feature film.  No video library is complete without this movie.
B00BNWWVFG|2.0|I expected more from Soderbergh but his output has been extremely inconsistent the last few years.  The plot twists in SIDE EFFECTS were neither unusual nor unpredictable and the acting consistently bland.  Art direction, cinematography and scoring were far below expectations, with Thomas Newman delivering an unmemorable dud of a soundtrack (shockingly, as he is one of my favorites).  Jude Law ALMOST saves the film with a fine, understated turn, but the mannered Ms. Mara is outdone only by the stone faced Ms. Zeta-Jones who spends 30 minutes of screen time looking constipated and ill-mannered.  The obligatory lesbian scene was laughable in its construction, timing, and (lack of) passion.  Overall, a real lemon.
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|it's OK.<br />That’s all I have to say about this game.<br />I cant say any thing else that has not been said about it in the other reviews,
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I just love the simplicity of the game's concept, but it does get challenging as you work through the levels.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|I wouldn't be without this ad blocker. It is the best on the market. I am very happy they have it for Kindle Fire!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I am so glad that this was not a fawning sycophantic homage to Zuckerberg.  I believe<br />that it illustrated his rise to fame and showed his flaws and immaturity as well as his genius.<br /><br />What is also showed is what a great country this is, that college kids can become millionaires with a good idea and hard work.<br /><br />Kudos to all the actors who were imminently believable in their roles. In movies there is this thing called \\"suspension of disbelief\\" where you give yourself over to the story line.  It was so well acted and filmed I felt like it was a a home movie shot behind the scenes.<br /><br />It also illustrated to me how Facebook came to be that I was previously not aware of.<br />Kudos to all and highly recommended
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is yet another amazing show that shouldn't have been cut short.  People are too busy watching honey-F@#king-Boo Boo, instead of paying attention to something that's actually creative and interesting
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great game if I ever saw or played one. The graphics are the best that I have seen in a game that is free to play. I would recommend it to anyone. Works flawlessly on the Kindle Fire HD. Keep up the good work.
B00E3D7WGU|4.0|I saw this show live, in Pittsburgh, and loved every single moment of it.  I was very excited to purchase the CD to jam to in my car!  I LOVE that she included ALL of the tracks from the concert, unlike past show CDs she's done.  However, the other reviews ARE correct in saying the audio quality is not the best.  Sometimes it just sounds like the mic levels are off, or the sounds are not balanced, or something.  I do appreciate that a live CD is just that - live and imperfect.  But, I haven't noticed this issue in Madonna's past live CDs.  The sound seemed to be fine when I saw the show in person.<br /><br />With that said and out of the way, the songs themselves are awesome.  Some highlights: Erotic Candy Shop, Masterpiece, Vogue, Revolver, I Don't Give A, I'm  a Sinner, I'm Addicted, Express Yourself/Born this Way.  Even the interludes are included and nice (Best Friend - yay!).<br /><br />Definitely worth it for a true Madonna fan, or anyone who missed the show.........or especially for someone who loved it and continues to love it as much as me!

B0033AX1YG|5.0|He is definitely incredible! One of the greatest blues players I have ever listened to. His death was a great loss to the music industry and he will truly be missed by all that knew of him and especially those like me who just found out about him through a friend.........

B00B6U63ZE|3.0|The book is written by a Harvard Business professor with acutal working knowledge of transitional business. In and of itself, that should be enough for any new leader to want to read this.<br />The author, Michael Watkins, looks at how to make a good first impression with your leadership skills, how to set yourself up for success in any new role (whether transistional, promotional, start-up, or managing an already succesful group), and how to investigate what is actually required from you and your new team.<br />Mr. Watkins' style of writing is a little dry, but he covers the subject material very well. He does not get off topic at any point, and uses very well written examples of each new skill - which anyone can translate to their own business career and then use to better understand that skill.<br />For those being promoted to a new position, those who are new to management, or those being transferred to a different department (within their own business or outside to a new corporation) this is a must read.
B00EJB44VW|4.0|Overall a very good use of non-biblical sources to place the gospel accounts in their contemporary religious and political context.<br /><br />I may have liked a more penetrating examination of the role of James in early Christianity, particularly with respect to his relationship with Paul.<br /><br />However, the analysis was in general illuminating and interesting. Well worth four stars.

This is the best stats book I've read  so far (out of around a couple of dozen). I bought a version for myself and one for my research team at work because mine was going out \\"on loan\\" so often. I've used it both as a reference (to look up a solution to a particular problem) and as a general read (to learn more about the theory behind a technique) and it works both ways. I'm really amazed at the talent and effort put into this book.

Well Worth the Price.<br /><br />Beware some seller are reselling this item at 2-3x retail and may have the plastic version of the Phaser.
B00E0G5U4G|4.0|This album is actually very good.  I'm really not a huge fan of Carcass' earlier stuff like Reek of Putrefaction.  Necrotism was decent and Heartwork was pretty good, but this one blows those two away!  This is easily one of the best albums of 2013 and any metal fan should buy this.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I pretty much knew that this would be a somewhat sad read going into it, but based on the glowing reviews, I decided to join the masses who enjoyed The Fault in Our Stars so much.  The audio version is read by Kate Rudd, who did a fantastic job.<br /><br />The story is narrated by 16 year-old, Hazel Grace Lancaster, who was diagnosed with stage IV, thyroid cancer at the age of 13. She's survived cancer thus far (3 years), but she has had to endure experimental drugs, and now carries a portable oxygen tank with her everywhere she goes.<br /><br />Depressed (who wouldn't be?) and taken out of her regular school during her treatments, she is encouraged to try a support group for cancer kids.  It is there that she meets, the handsome 17 year-old Augustus Waters, and the two engage in various philosophical debates, and one thing leads to another -- before long becoming more than just friends. Hazel is obsessed with a book about cancer called, An Imperial Affliction and she encourages Augustus (Gus) to read it, so she can get his opinion on the ambiguous ending.<br /><br />Without giving away too much about this novel,  I'll just say that this book is very much about being a teen and dealing with cancer, in addition to dealing with the other challenges healthy teens face.  It's about making the most out of the circumstances you've been forced to deal with.  It's about love, life and death, and the delivery is just so well done.<br /><br />The story is full of beautiful passages. I ended up highlighting  these in my eBook edition after hearing some of them on audio.........................<br /><br />\\"The marks humans leave are too often scars.\\"<br /><br />\\"There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that's what everyone else does.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\\"<br /><br />\\"There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.\\"<br /><br />\\"Almost everyone is obsessed with leaving a mark upon the world. Bequeathing a legacy. Outlasting death. We all want to be remembered. I do, too. That's what bothers me most, is being another<br />unremembered casualty in the ancient and inglorious war against disease.\\"<br />\\"So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.\\"<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is a story that you'll think about for a long while. It's such a touching story, one that reminds us once again, that --- life, indeed, is hard and often unfair.  I enjoyed this book a lot and can't wait to see the movie in 2014.h a touching story, one that reminds us once again, that --- life, indeed, is hard and often unfair.

B00B7Y0206|1.0|I downloaded it and at first it's pretty good. Then after about a week I guess it thinks you have watched too many videos because now if I click on a video I want to watch it comes up with a message box that says &quot;null&quot; and then makes me click on okay and goes back to the video list. Sucks.... truly sucks the only way to fix this issue is to delete it from the device and 'download it again. But it's the only one that is okay enough that is free for kindle fire. Otherwise it is so poorly constructed its pathetic! If you have a little extra money to spend on a better app I would recommend spend the extra money and get a better app.
B005TTEFRG|4.0|It's a nice movie, but nothing like the original one. Of course it's great that it's not the same all over again like in the past movie, but it's not as awesome. I think it was a good movie, but it lacked something to make it better.

B005F3GMAO|5.0|As I wrote in my title, I remembered that I was a freeman , and the life, every single second was supposed to be mine. As I live in a deep capitalized daily life, present society unconsciously makes me feel that my life depends on other's opinions. On top of that , the happiness, perhaps, seems like it is measured by how much I have in my bank account, and I have no clear answer to deny.<br /><br />For people who are feeling that sort of pressure, this book might give you broader sight answering question \\" how will you measure you life\\".

B005LAIH2M|5.0|I dislike Jeremy Renner as an actor. I wish he was replaced and maybe I'd definitely, completely enjoy it. Even though he was given the crucial part int he movie, he made it just fine. The movie is really, really awesome. Nice special effects, amazing plot. The movie is nearly amazing! I will watch it again with big pleasure! I wish there were more movies like this one!

B007X4ECLY|4.0|The movie is very, very cool. I loved some actors, the plot is great, but yet it lacks something. I wish there were more beauty to the movie. In what way, I'm not sure, but it feels like it could have been amazing if Luc Besson added some more beauty to it. I really enjoyed it but it felt like 'the dish lacked some sauce'!

I would shrug and laugh it off.<br /><br />Upon the release of Battle Born, my brother halfheartedly hands over his prized possession so I can give it a listen. Coming from a (once) unbiased source, I can say that this is the best album I've ever listened to. It's one of the few albums I can just press play and leave it alone without flying into a blind rage because of an awful song.<br /><br />Now I echo my brother's sentiments. Don't be an idiot. Don't pass up the opportunity to finally have good taste.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Simple game with great graphics. Draws you in. Very amusing and made me a fan within 10 minutes. Cannot imagine life without it.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|**No Spoilers**<br /><br />Nothing about the movie engaged me, and I was never more than mildly entertained.  The setting and characters alike are too detached from anything I could really care about.  The acting itself is fine, but the character development seemed lacking and stale.  The characters as a whole never feel human, but cold and callous.  For myself there were no major plot twists or revelations that surprised me, in fact I had the majority of the movie figured out midway through.  In the end I was left wanting more - character development, robust story, action, almost anything.  The best part about the movie is the visuals and CGI - these are quite stunning and done incredibly well.  Overall, the movie is about the survival of humanity, but the film feels very far from anything human or real to me.
1780387105|5.0|I love this song book, and the accompanying Justin Guitar website with video lessons. It is a great way to learn the guitar, and there are some really good songs in this book. I like the spiral binding which allows the book to lay flat. The chords and words for each song are presented on one side, with notes regarding strumming and rhythm, and other tips on the facing page. The website offers a video discussion of the song.
B006PFSVYQ|5.0|I loved the movie. The animation was great and characters are likable. I didn't think making animation with real life actors would be a good idea, and I'd rather see a completely animated movie, but then it still wasn't bad. It was quite a good movie and I totally loved pink berets!

1594202273|3.0|Overall the book was an interesting read.<br /><br />Firsthand accounts from weapons designers all the way down to the individual airmen whose jobs it was to design, maintain, and deliver the nation's nuclear arsenal. Schlosser details the history of the US nuclear weapons program, paying particular attention to Curtis Lemay's take no prisoner approach to the organization of SAC and the nation's nuclear deterrent, with Lemay's legendary demand for perfection from all his subordinates. Lemay's transformation of SAC from a Chinese fire drill to the crack organization he turned it into was particularly good. Even with Lemay's organizational changes, there were many many accidents involving nuclear weapons. Schlosser touches on most of the notable ones and spends considerable time on a Titan II launch complex just north of Damascus Arkansas. Although I dislike the way he staged it in the book, it was still an interesting read.<br /><br />I'd rate the book higher had Schlosser not given into the fear mongering babble though. While all the incidents Schlosser covered were serious, the actual risk for an accidental nuclear explosion from an external event (fire, explosion, impact) is infinitesimally small. In order for a nuclear weapon of the kind in the Titan II missile to be set off a very precise set of choreographed events have to take place. Nuclear weapons consist of a hollow sphere of plutonium surrounded by a shell of conventional explosives. These conventional high explosives are detonated within a few millionths of a second creating a perfectly spherical shockwave that crushes and compresses the plutonium pit in a perfectly uniform manner. Then chain reaction occurs and we get a mushroom cloud. Its designed to be so precise, because it has to be. There have been accidents involving nuclear weapons where the weapons were mutilated and fire set of the high explosive shell with no detonation of the core.<br /><br />The books a good read for its prose and its information, but the glaring omission I detailed above throws a wet blanket on many of Schlosser's conclusions from the probability of an accidental explosions (realistically zero) to the need for global disarmament as the only way to prevent this non event from taking place.tion, but the glaring omission I detailed above throws a wet blanket on many of Schlosser's conclusions from the probability of an accidental explosions (realistically zero) to the need for global disarmament as the only way to prevent this non event from taking place.

B008KOTNVA|5.0|Bought this for working on small electronics.<br /><br />Had to remove over 150 T5 screws and there's no visible wear on the bit, still sharp clean edges, no bending etc.<br /><br />My only complaint is the little rubber rings used for grip on the driver handle. A flat sleeve of rubber would have been better as the rings become rather painful on your fingers if you have to use the driver for extended periods. I didn't knock a star for it because I doubt many people will have to use it for hours on end for multiple days in a row like I did.

B00E6890RG|5.0|I had never heard of Haken before this album, and have very recently gotten into progressive rock and metal in general (Bands such as dream theater, symphony x, pink Floyd, and porcupine trees). I usually listen to much more simplistic metal and punk bands and as a result, the first full play-through of this album took me out of my comfort zone. In fact, the first time I heard Cockroach King, I absolutely hated it, and it even turned me off of the album for a bit.<br /><br />However, after several repeated listens to the album I have grown to admire the genius of the album (including Cockroach King), and the entire album has easily jumped to the top of my list of favorite albums. It is a ton of fun to listen to, the lyrics are deep and performed evocatively by the lead singer, and the rest of the band displays their technical prowess creatively without ever overdoing it at the expense of the overall sound.<br /><br />This album sounds fresh and modern with an equal dose of epic and quirky sound, and never gets boring. I will definitely check out Haken's previous work, and keep an eye on this band. Long live Haken!

The ending though was somewhat of a surprise, that the two main characters are brother and sister. I'm debating whether or not I want to continue on with the rest of the series.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|I love this book as an encyclopedia of sorts.  If you want to read about weight loos, go directly to that section. If you want to gain muscle, skip ahead to that. It is not a straight through, cover-to-cover read. If you are interested in the human body and maybe a little science, it is chock full of cool stuff. I particularly enjoy his approach to weight loss and have successfully used his methods in my own lifestyle. I recommend this book to anyone who loves learning about the fascinating human body!
B00DELKA3Y|5.0|There is something special about \\"Downton Abbey\\". It has all the trappings of a typical British costume drama, but it's got an extra spark that's allowed it to travel overseas and find great success here in the United States. I am a male in his 20s who enjoys dark TV shows like \\"Dexter\\" and \\"Breaking Bad\\" - on the surface, I'm not exactly in the demographic you'd think would be interested in \\"Downton Abbey\\". But I gave the show a chance, and I really enjoy it. So I'd encourage you to give it a chance too. Between \\"Downton Abbey\\" and the BBC's \\"Sherlock\\", I think Britain has two of the best shows of recent years.<br /><br />As with any great TV show, \\"Downton Abbey\\" has a strong narrative and well-written characters. One thing that sounded a bit off-putting about the show was the idea of rich folks living in their castle with a bunch of servants. But as you watch, its obvious that the Crawleys (who own the estate) care very much for their staff. And when financial troubles hit the family, they do their very best to keep all their staff on payroll. They consider it their duty, and even their honor, to employ as many people as possible and treat them well (this is something that large companies today could learn from).<br /><br />One of the most fun aspects is that this world is unfamiliar to most of us. The show's timeline so far spans from 1912 to the early 1920s. People spoke, dressed, and acted differently than they do now. Various world events from the time period are referenced in the show - the sinking of the Titanic and the British campaigns of World War I are two in particular that greatly affect the series and its characters.<br /><br />This show feels very cinematic - the locations, the costumes, the sound design and the music are all fantastic. Despite TV programs having limited resources, this show is an example of what talented directors can achieve on a modest budget - the show feels every bit as grand in scope as a Hollywood feature film.<br /><br />** If you're a Prime member, you can stream all three seasons for free right now on Amazon Instant Video.If you're a Prime member, you can stream all three seasons for free right now on Amazon Instant Video.

My guess is that Google will fix this issue over time; mine is the first release of the Chromecast device.  It does stream youtube vids so that is fun. I just wish it did what I had hoped for.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|The movie was great and the HD picture was great.  The sound was not good.  We had to turn our sound all the way up and still had trouble hearing it.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Watching the Good Wife without commercials is a joy! But the great experience is to be able to watch each show in an on going fashion without sporting event interruptions and digging to find the show to DVR it.  Last year we missed 2 or more shows due to pushing out the Good Wife.  Ridiculous.  I LOVE AMAZON STREAMING ! ! ! !  - - - - - -Julianna Margulies is my absolute favorite character in The Good Wife.  She is a steller performer.  How much can I rave about Archie Panjabi - - - She steels the scene each and every time.  Alan Cumming and Matt Czuchry are hot ! hot ! hot ! and truly enhance the cast of characters.  Josh Charles and Christine Baranski are the characters who even though they are sometimes gross and disgusting they are the balance that makes the Good Wife work.  I don't like Will Gardner - he is such a wuss.  Diane's haughtier than thou attitude makes me go yuck, but you just have to go with it in order to get the amazing other casts and enjoy the show.  Thank you Amazon for streaming The Good Wife ! I will be watching it over and over.
B005LAJ1O0|2.0|It seems that the majority or people who dislike this show are prudish, religious folks who are easily offended.<br />I wanted to add a review since I am not one of those people. I like a wide variety of films and find sex and violence are often aspects of some of my favorites.<br /><br />The concept of a show that touches on many classic horror themes is so ripe with possibilities. Unfortunately the show lacks focus. The term \\"Hot Mess\\" keeps coming to mind. Rather than slowly building a compelling story (a TV series is the perfect medium for this) , they go for a kind of fast-food delivery. There are secrets that do take the whole season to unfold, but the show tries to incorporate too many elements and characters for it's own good. By the end of the season I felt that I did not care what happened to the characters, I was just sticking around for the big reveals.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Was not altogether certain this was the right book for me but by the end I was crying for both our heroine and her lover. Definitely curious about the second book now. An intriguing read.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book about how total stranger can and sometimes do fall for one another. Written in a way that makes you want to keep on reading.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great. Once the movie or video is started it doesn't require your IPAD anymore. The resolution is always the highest available.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I am not going to like seeing Ziva leave.  The charisma between her and Tony really help make the show. I enjoy the mystery<br />but every once in awhile  the humor and romance is good.  I hope this show goes on for a very long time.  Can't imagine<br />who could fill Ziva's shoes the mystery and intrigue her character has it so good
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great writing! Believable characters and hilarious villians (Louis) that you want to hate one minute and feel sorry for the next.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this game you have plenty of energy to work with unlike other games. This game is very different then other building games.
B008Y6UND6|3.0|Yes, the hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was, for the most part, very well done and stayed fairly true to the story-line [whereas the european version was a sad and very inaccurate version].<br />However, the author, Stieg Larsson, made a major point in his book and the others in the series, to provide readers with some of the awful statistics about violence against women.  He wanted the reader to love the thriller [and we do] but he also wanted the reader to be appalled by our/society's continued countenance of the abuse, rape, and slavery of women all over the world - and America is a big offender.  So, for this movie to ignore one of the author's major points is nothing short of sad - very sad - and a gross injustice.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Ask good as the first book!!! Read them both within two days!! Must reads!! On to the next one l!! Job well done
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to it.... I just can't get enough of it....!!!  I am completely in love with this site.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use it a lot especially for medical terms and directions., have not been disappointed or misguided yet. would recommend<br />to any one
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|What a great show.  I am glad that I was able to watch the previous seasons and catch up.  I am ready to start season 4!
B005VPRETE|5.0|My son loves it as much as my daughter.  Fun present!  They both enjoyed building it and are still playing with it and changing it around.  My daughter loves the cat.
0765348276|5.0|Great sci fi fun.  Enough of the military jargon and activity to keep interesting, along with a story that twists out of the Heinlein template.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The update made this app useless and hard to use.  very difficult to actually find information about the weather.  Uninstalling now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had to have it......as soon as I finish book two...I was so hooked on the story that I had to inmediately buy book three. Can't wait to see the movies (2 and 3)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|We all know the main gist of this book but it really is a great read. The author pulls you into the story and allows you to visualize every detail as if you are relieving a memory . At some point the sex does become redundant and boring, you obviously get the gist of the carnal passion exchanged between the characters but then again that sex is what's driving this story. Great book can't wait to get into the next one, I am a very slow reader and if I am not hooked by the first couple of pages I abandon it, needless to say I finished it in a week's time, and that is because I have to sleep, eat, work, and other obligations to attend to, otherwise I could have finished in a day or two!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|So this game is one of those build your own city type of game.  Similar to popular games on Facebook like Cityville and Farmville.  Let's just name this Oceanville.  It's fun and addictive in the beginning but gets boring the more you play it because it's pretty much doing the same things over and over many times.  The graphics is nice though and should be fun for the kids.
B001AIY58O|3.0|The Taco Bell part ruined the movie, it's the future!!! like every restaurant would be Taco Bell, I don't understand why that was in the film, sooo stupid
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I have to say Is \\"wow!\\" I couldn't put it down!!! I loved it!<br /><br />I can't wait to start the 2nd one!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|As I use it more and learn more about it I love it even more.  I live in a rather remote area and radio service is sketchy.  Love that I can have breakfast with the homey folks in Fairbanks and catch my sports even when they are not on TV.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I didn't know how much fun was. My kids have it for the Nintendo and they really enjoy it... so I decided to try it myself...I really like it.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|Not really crystal, but the glass had flaws that wouldn't polish out. I sent it back the next day. I'm sure the watch functions fine.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Provides good insight into how flawed the legal system can be. Guess for the system to work everyone needs the best defense their money can buy.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I cannot say enough about how much I love this show.  Everything is perfect - character development, intensity, humor, etc.  It's simply great entertainment!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every time you think you got it, this show throws you for a loop. Very good series highly recommend.  Good job guys
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Is  there anything that can't be found on You Tube?  Love it!  I'm probably one of the last to discover this as I am not really a computer person.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like it, it's simple and easy to use and doesn't required anything.  I downloaded the kindle version and it was only a trial basis.. I just wanted to something easy to use to balance my checkbook.
B0095VPBFY|4.0|I do some light video editing so nothing to intensive and this processor has`t fail on me yet. Games are actuall nice and the games I`ve played is League of legends, Grind 3, Minecraft, Left for dead 2 and more. In my opinion I find that I get better fps on Windows 7 than Windows 8. For Minecraft players out there is cpu is alright but don`t expect best proformance. The more mods you put in the slower gameplay will be so be carefull. HD content is awesome, nothing has slowed down yet. This cpu will be great for people who is just doing light gaming and web browsing. Hope it helped you out.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This is what television was made for. The writing, acting and production are top-notch. My entire family has become hooked on this television series like....well... Methheads craving their next hit. This show deserves all the accolades it has received through the years, and as a T.V. fan since the \\"Golden Age\\" of it's inception, I am completely and utterly stunned by each episode of this quality show. Vince and his writers are nothing less than pure geniuses and I'm looking forward to his next venture. Yes, I gush too much, but this show and each season's DVD's are simply phenomenal television!<br /><br />Bill Rohane<br />.
B005LAII44|5.0|At last a action movie without a lot of profanity and the action was constant. I usually have grand kids here so I only buy DVD's without the constant use of the 'F' word . Unfortunately A warning is not posted on the DVD . I enjoyed this movie
B003M70O5O|5.0|By the time I watched season two it was adictive. Love SOA now. Can hardly wait for each new episode.
B0082XJGRK|4.0|&#34;Written in Greek by the only Roman emperor who was also a philosopher, without any intention of publication, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) offer a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence and Marcus' own emotions. But while the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, in developing his beliefs Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection of extended meditations and short aphorisms that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and readers through the centuries.<br /><br />Martin Hammond's new translation fully expresses the intimacy and eloquence of the original work, with detailed notes elucidating the text. This edition also includes an introduction by Diskin Clay, exploring the nature and development of the Meditations, a chronology, further reading and full indexes.&#34;
080701429X|5.0|If you could only read one book in your life, this is the one.  Every person should read this, and every parent (and teacher) should teach this as early as possible.  Many do, whether based on Frankl or good common sense and intuition.  This book reminds us that no matter what happens to you, no matter what others do to you, no matter how life treats you, no matter.... the one thing that no one can take from you, the one thing over which you have control, is how you react.  My mother taught me this when I was growing up- every morning, she would tell  me, you can choose to smile or frown.  Same cost, your choice.  She intuitively knew what Frankl wrote, but it's always good to be reminded of this.  This book does that and more.  When you question what the meaning of life is, turns out the answer is in the question- meaning.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I never rate anything but I had to rate this one. Pretty darn cool. I've played other types of games like this but they don't come close to this. Keep up the good work.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The characters were so intriguingly unique.  The description of the backdrop and character were so vivid for the imagination. Once started reading didn't want want to stop. Initially there was some issues with the number of characters involved and their purpose. Great writing!
0517147688|5.0|Who wouldn't like to have all of Jane Austen's novels in one book? I never tire of reading her work. As a book, it is very reasonably priced for a leather bound book at about $11. Makes a great addition to your library.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|This is a very specific story about the long-term love affair between Johnny and June Carter.  Its not a biopic of his life but a well-told story about two people who were really meant to be together and the time it took to do that.  Excellent acting - impressive musical performances by both Joaquin and Reese.  Should be seen as a classic.
159420229X|5.0|&#34;When we meet Joshua Foer, his memory is “nothing special.” A year later, he is able to memorize the order of a shuffled deck of cards in less than two minutes and the names of 99 people he’s just met. He has also etched in his brain images of his friend urinating on Pope Benedict’s skullcap, of Rhea Perlman involved in indelicate acts with Manute Bol, and of other things most of us would try hard to forget. Let it never be claimed that there is no cost to self-improvement.&#34; - ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ
B009JZSC9S|5.0|jUST ABOUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF GREED, HONESTY, AND RAUNCHINESS BLENDED TOGETHER TO MAKE A MEMORABLE, WELL WRITTEN SERIES. i LOOK FORWARD TO EVERY EPISODE.
0399255370|5.0|Funny, clever, unsentimental and wonderfully illustrated.  I bought it for my son-in-law, an artist and Oliver Jeffers fan.  It's great.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Really liked the movie. Well made, funny. Kept my daughter and laughing. Would love to watch it again. Kept the whole family entertained.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Simple, fun game. Can get frustrating because it actually is a challenge, sometimes. My advice, concentrate on traction first, worry about power last.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|My order was easily traceable,  although shipping was so fast it wasn't needed. And the price was cheaper for blu ray than a used copy on dvd purchased local.  seems like it has a small glitch, doesnt skip,  but kinda sticks for just a sec. I believe it to be a factory defect issue,  and will not hender my use of them in the future.
0812550757|2.0|After reading Ender's Game I was really excited to read this book.  It turned out to be a huge disappointment.  Some of the ideas were just plain silly - the galactic government didn't want humans to interfere with the development of the \\"piggies\\" or contaminate their culture, yet they established a colony on the planet, and had people make contact with them and teach them English and Portuguese.  There are plenty of examples of ideas that just don't add up and they're so plain that it distracts while you are reading.<br /><br />The main struggle in the plot is not re-establishing the buggers and giving them a second chance, or the piggies, or anything interesting - it is about the troubles of a family that was ruined because the mom justified terrible decisions with self pity throughout her life.  Why should I spend my time reading about the weakest and worst people I've ever meet?
B00BB8OHMW|4.0|This movie was fun to watch because it educated a bit about that time in history, the actors played their roles well and made me laugh, and it is a good story line.
