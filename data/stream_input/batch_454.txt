B0006284JQ|1.0|As far as I'm concerned, britney spears has always been a face & body. She can't sing, as most people know, especially in comparison to Christina, other people pretty much write & produce hits for her since she can't do it, her dancing is good but she's no Janet, her concerts are like two hour lapdances & she always contradicts herself. Jive did a great job of promoting her & they made millions. Lets be honest, she used sex & image to sell records from day one cause she couldn't make it on talent. From sexy school girl to full on [...]! C'mon, does anybody really believe that she can take a four year hiatus to have some kids & then make a strong comback in 2008? I don't think so! After a while of her not putting out  music & the constant pictures of her looking like hell, the public will grow tired of her & she's just gonna demise like Paula Abdul. She just doesn't have the talent. People compare her to Madonna alot but Madonna was a strong, confident business woman who took control of her career & image from day one. britney had people telling her what to do & just went along with it. She's a very immature young girl who still has alot to learn.
1582432678|4.0|This is a superbly written novel that will take its readers into the dark recesses of a mother's heart.  Early in the novel, I attempted to understand what made Kevin the way he was; later, I held my breath awaiting the inevitable emotional and/or physical destruction that he would inflict.  The ultimate mystery is not what created someone without any feelings of connection, but why his father couldn't accept the horrendous workings of his son's mind before the ultimate tragedies.  Kevin's interactions with his mother were heartbreaking and cannot, I believe, be understood by anyone without a psychopath in his or her life.  This book is totally absorbing and has left a dent in my heart.

0380820846|2.0|I've read the other Bridgerton romances, and found this one completely uninspiring.  Naturally, having met 'poor Penelope' in the other stories (I tried to read them in order), I could not get excited about her finding love, finally.  I also got a little tired of the 'this son doesn't have the title but he does have a fat purse, engaging smile, yadda yadda.' I kept wanting to shout, 'Get on with it!'  This is the first one I've put down without finishing.  It's still not finished, and has been relegated to a certain room in my house.  The ultimate book insult.
0679411585|5.0|This book is a rarity.  It sticks stricly to facts, but it is overwhelmingly moving.  It is both an account of a battle and a sweeping microcosm of the the whole war at the same time.  Gen. Moore and journalist Galloway were participants in the first large scale battle of the Vietnam war.  They tell the story, primary through the voice of then Lt. Col. Moore, in a strictly factual style, in keeping with the best military writing. But this is no dry \\"after action\\" report.  Moore loved his men, and they loved him back.  The reader  mourns every death, just as the commander did.  Moore was, as he promised his men, to first man in and the last man out, and he left behind no one, dead or alive.  The result is a gripping drama of real Americans caught up in the confusion of Vietnam's steaming jungles and nationalistic fervor.  This is page turning history.  But this book is so much more than just a great war story.  By highlighting specific command decisions at the brigade, division and political levels, Moore elevates this single battle into a compelling depiction of both the military and political strategies of the US in Vietnam.  While the battalion and company level focus of the book cannot begin to represent a comprehensive treatment of the American experience in Vietnam, the reader is permitted to see the consequences of the tactical frustration caused by the political decisions of the higher brass and the Johnson Administration, such as respecting the Cambodian border when the beaten NVA retreated accross it with the Americans in hot pursuit.  Even the home front impact of the war is dramatized by a chapter devoted to Moore's wife personally delivering death notices to the wives of men killed in the battle--this history is truly heartbreaking.  Perhaps the best service done by this book is the portray the truth about the American fighting man in Vietnam.  Despite the bad image the media perpetuates, the truth is that Americans fought and died in Vietnam with the best of intentions and with great military results.  We killed 10 NVA for every American that died.  The American failure in Vietnam was political, not military.  We underestimated the depth and resiliency of Vietnamese nationalism and we possibly overestimated the threat of Vietnamese Communism.  But don't blame Hal Moore or the men of the 7th Air Cavalry.  They fought with guts, beat the odds and answered the call of their country.  We need to choose our friends and our battles more wisely, but we cannot hope to do better than to count on men like Hal Moore and the troopers of the 7th Cavalry.
B000687M48|5.0|Quick an simple...\\"Anywhere but Home\\" is a great CD.  The live CD gives you a chance to hear how great the band sounds without all the equipment in the studio enhancing them.  I was one of the lucky people to see Evanescence this year on tour.  They are an amazing live band.  If you are a loyal Evanescence fan, then you really shouldn't complain about them releasing a live album already.  Just be thankful they've released something for your listening pleasure.  You could still be waiting for something to be released!
078322608X|5.0|The world's population is practically wiped out by a killer virus. The survivors are forced to live in underground communities. James Cole ( Bruce Willis) is a time traveler from the year 2035. He is forced against his will, to go into the past and obtain a sample of the pure virus, to help the scientists find a cure. Along the way, he manages to cross paths with a beautiful psychiatrist ( Madeline Stowe), and an extremely unstable mental patient ( Brad Pitt). With danger closing in, Cole must race to find a radical group linked to the disease known only as The Army of the 12 Monkeys.  <br /> <br />\\"12 Monkeys\\", is probably one of my favorite science fiction films. It features an incredible script that takes us back and forth between the past and the present and we see the lives of the main characters all intertwined over a period of six years. The film is quite complex, and even strange at times. But the one thing that it never fails to do is entertain you. The set designs and stunning visuals are one of the film's best features. The costume designs from the future could only be created by Terry Gilliam. He is the master of the unusual. The ending to the film is very shocking and ties all the events of the film together perfectly. While it will be upsetting to some, it was extremely satisfying and it made perfect sense. <br /> <br />Bruce Willis gives the performance of his career with James Cole. There are so many things about the role that are pleasing. The first being his adjusting to the past, and living above ground. Willis accurately captures the suprise one in his situation would feel. The second being his fight to prove what he is saying about the present time is true. This is where she shows fierce determination. The third being his fight to remain sain and rational. Willis actually could pass for a mental patient. The transition from sane to insane is amazing to see. Madeline Stowe is sexy and intelligent as Dr. Kathryn Railly. Watching her go from skeptical doctor, to helping James on his mission is great. But the best performance however was given by Brad Pitt. Pitt is truly off of his rocker for the entire film and will not only make you laugh, but amaze and shock you with what he does as well.  <br /> <br />\\"12 Monkeys\\" is a complex and beautiful masterpiece in the science fiction genre. The acting, complex story, effects and visuals, and outstanding ending all equal one thing : perfection. The Collector's Edition DVD is amazing. The best feature is \\"The Hamster Factor\\". It is a short film about the making of \\"12 Monkeys\\". You also get cast and crew biographies, the original theatrical trailer, production notes, and more.  <br />
B000002H33|5.0|Who dare to sayeth \\"MofP\\" sucks?  They are blasphemus dogs and should be treated as such.  Now I am no GIANT Metallica fan, at least when compared to many others, but i am a fan of theirs as well as *METAL!!!*, despite the attitudes of some members of metallica.  Now while this is not my favorite metal album ever, it is my second favorite (right behind Appetite for Destruction).  My question is \\"Why doest thou hate on MofP so?\\", moreover, \\"If this is not 'real metal', what, pre-tell, is?\\", 'cause let me tell u, this is it, boys and girls.  THIS IS *METAL!!!!*  Really.  I mean, I respect other's opinions, but...WTF!?  I mean, even if u hate this album, u at least have to respect the fact that this album is probably the cause of many of today's (so-called) metal bands.  Really, this album is golden.  A metal masterpiece.  Oh well some people are just never satisfied.
B0006399FS|5.0|I hate them.  They go on SNL and do a live performance with real vocals and instruments, they make passionate songs about real issues in the world and issues with peoples personal lives like love and death, they give all they got every night on tour, and they just produced an album with absolutely no skip-overs.  They need to retire.
B0006399FS|2.0|My sentiments exactly, after hearing the the rockin' \\"Vertigo\\" with the \\"old school\\" U2 sound - outstanding Edge riffs seamlessly complimented by Adam's bass and finally letting Larry what he does best, playing something other than a 1-2 tempo - the rest of the album is very mellow and unfortunately, not in a \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" sort of way.  <br /> <br />I did find the music reminding me of earlier U2 and just listening to their unique and layered sound makes this a satisfying album.  However, I found the biggest difference was Bono.  For someone who seems to have boundless energy and seems to be all over the world promoting his beliefs and political views, his energy is non-existent on this album; or shall I say, subdued.   <br /> <br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is like watching U2 live in concert with Bono singing from a Lazy Boy chair.  The music's there, best the vocals aren't. <br /> <br /> <br />
1582432678|5.0|\\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" is a disquieting, provocative, and brilliantly written novel about a mother, desperately attempting to understand why her son, 15-year-old Kevin, brutally, with premeditation, murdered seven of his fellow classmates, a cafeteria worker and his English teacher in a Columbine-style school massacre. There have been nationwide discussions on the cause of events like these - especially during the 1990s when it seemed like school shootings ran rampant throughout the US. In Pearl, Paducah, Springfield, Littleton, seemingly normal kids, kids who had almost everything a child could want, became terribly derailed. Some argue that the proliferation of and easy access to guns is the cause; others that the excess of violence in movies, TV programs and video games induce violent behavior in children and adolescents. The one question almost everyone seems to have in common is, \\"What were these murderous kids' parents like?\\" \\"Didn't they recognize symptoms of violence in their own children?\\"<br /><br />Eva Khatchadourian, Kevin's bereft mother, narrates this novel through a series of compelling letters to her estranged husband, Franklin. She examines her son's life, from conception to his terrible act of violence, trying to understand the why of it. What becomes clear early on is that Eva tortures herself with blame. She is guilt-ridden that her shortcomings as a parent might have caused Kevin's evil act, his violent behavior, his very nature. She must have failed, she must have been deficient as a mother, for her boy to commit such a chilling crime. She also considers that neither nature nor nurture are solely responsible for shaping a child's character. Her honest, introspective correspondence to her beloved husband causes the reader to consider that some children just might be born bad. How and when are psychopaths created? The reader is pulled back and forth between empathy and blame, anger and grief, and perhaps, ultimately to forgiveness.<br /><br />Through Eva's perspective we watch a story unfold. A happy, almost idyllic marriage to Franklin; a brilliant career in a business which she, herself, created; her ambivalent feelings when she became pregnant, an event which interfered with her career; the indifference she felt when she held her son for the first time; Kevin's difficult infancy - he refused his mother's milk and didn't like to be held by her; his total manipulation of his father, who believed Kevin could do no wrong, putting a permanent strain on the marriage; Kevin's lack of empathy and cruel streak, which he blatantly flaunted in front of his mother and hid from his Dad; and Eva's fear that her dislike for her son, which she went overboard to conceal, would damage him - further escalating his already violent nature.<br /><br />\\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" examines how a heinous event can impact a town, a marriage, a family and an individual. It also causes the reader to reflect on the concept of unconditional love. Lionel Shriver's clear, crisply crafted prose builds tension throughout her novel, ultimately leading to a stunning conclusion. Her narrative is almost perfectly paced. This is an extraordinary psychological study that gripped me, riveted me, from the first page to the last. And the author ably portrays the complexity and the horror of the act and the consequences. I was seriously left breathless and horribly saddened after finishing the book. This is most definitely not an \\"up\\" novel or a light read. However, it may be my favorite book of 2004 and I cannot recommend it highly enough. I have purchased 2 more of Ms. Shriver's novels as a result of reading this one.<br /><br />JANA/> <br />Through Eva's perspective we watch a story unfold.

B0002Y69NQ|5.0|I didn't buy any of The Matrix movies because I knew this was coming out in December. For those of you that did, quit complaining, and for those who don't like The Matrix shut up already! All of those that hate on this film couldn't have done it yourself or even imagined it. This collection is for fans of the movie so leave it at that. By the way, if you havn't seen Ghost in the Shell, rent it or buy it. That's where many ideas for The Matrix came from.
B00005JMUL|5.0|I was this movie in IMAX 3D first, and let me tell you, it was flat out amazing.  The 3d effects are the best I've seen so far, and this film makes very good use of IMAX technology.  I then saw it about a week later in an ordinary movie theater.  Good, but it wasn't even the same experience as in IMAX.  When the train comes, the IMAX theater shook.  See this movie, it's a christmas classic.  And if at all possible, see it in IMAX 3D, it's well worth the trip.  IMAX 3D brings out the best in this film.
B00008RH1H|3.0|Macbeth, a tragedy written by Shakespeare, was dramatically translated not only onto film from stage but also to a Japanese language, culture, and plot into this film, \\"Throne of Blood\\".  Kurosawa Akira, one of Japan's most incredible directors, altered the details of the play to make the plot take place during the Edo period.  There is a huge impact in the new creation of the tragic heroes, Washizu and Asaji, with the absorption of Japanese culture by world's famous story Macbeth.  Although, enjoying to the Japanese eyes, this may not be a significant alteration to all Shakespeare lovers. <br />  <br />Kurosawa's interpretation of Lady Macbeth was very emotionless compared to Shakespeare's to adapt to the old Japanese culture.  Without the passion or the cruelty that Lady Macbeth possessed, Asaji was still and quiet; yet she had the power to motivate her husband.  This is ironic because the desperate desire of Lady Macbeth was the major blame of the tragedy; however, Kurosawa intentionally made her into a quiet woman.  Without knowing the original story, it would be hard to blame Asaji for the responsibility for her husband's murder and deeds.  Actually, Washizu seems most culpable for the cause of the whole tragedy because he couldn't control his desire and was unaware of the approaching danger. <br />  <br />Warriors were a symbol of pride and honesty during the Edo period in Japan, and this influenced Washizu to become more chivalrous than Macbeth.  Washizu does lack his devoted and sincere attitude during the end; however, compared to Macbeth, he stayed loyal to the King and his friend for a longer time.  Even when Asaji cried for their son to have the throne, Washizu kept his own idea to give his throne to Banquo's son to show him his appreciation and loyalty.  This indicates that he still has kindness and humanness in his heart which Macbeth didn't have in the original play: he planned the murder of Banquo by himself, without his wife's advice or permission.Macbeth's cowardly character is not emphasized too much because of the Japanese custom, that men are strong willed, and especially if he is a warrior, he must be opinionated and brave.   <br />  <br />In this film, \\"Throne of Blood\\", Japanese culture and plot influenced the characters greatly, by changing their unique trademarks, which benefited the story to adapt to the Edo period and seem vivid and friendly to the Japanese audience.   However, this edition weakened the cruel tragedy for the antagonists that Shakespeare created and the bizarre twist that distinguished Macbeth from other ordinary tragic plots.  <br />
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I loved this movie. It was about a friendship developing, not a quick roll in the hay. Two people stuck in a culture not their own, find each other and discover they have much more to share than their ability to speak English. Tis is one of the few movies i feel is worth buying and watching again. It is a keeper.
6302891272|3.0|My name is Brandon and I am a student of Nagoya International School. Recently I watched the Throne of Blood in my pre-AP British Literature class. I found that the Japanese culture gave the story a very different feeling from the original Macbeth. For example it made the witch, or evil spirit, very fearsome and serious. This gave the movie some suspense the book didn't have. Some famous scenes, like Macbeth's soliloquy, were left out but were replaced with others, like Lady Macbeth's pregnancy, death and reappearance as a ghost. I liked how Macbeth's own soldiers killed him, but I missed the scene with Macbeth and Macduff in Act 5. <br /> Macbeth's character was portrayed quite differently in my opinion. He was much stronger and courageous, showing more pride and power. This made Macbeth seem more like a real samurai. The only time he struggled with fear and guilt was when he saw Banquo's ghost. That is because in the Japanese culture ghosts were very real and resembled fear and death. <br /> Although Lady Macbeth had fewer lines, she seemed corrupt from the very beginning. She didn't persuade Macbeth to kill the King, by telling him he was a coward, she just subtly nagged at him until he broke. Macbeth's weaknesses were revealed to the audience in this way. In the film Macbeth actually saw his wife go insane whereas in the play he chose to ignore it. This let Macbeth know that his corruption was even affecting his wife. <br /> There was a significant more amount of violence in this film, but it fit the samurai impression that most of us have. Macbeth's killing of his servant allowed the audience to clearly see his anger and frustration. <br /> The director of the Throne of Blood cleverly mixed the themes of Macbeth with the Japanese culture, allowing fans of Macbeth to experience the story in a whole new way. I recommend this movie for anyone who has enjoyed the tragedy of Macbeth either by book or by another film. <br />
B00005JKES|5.0|I've seen a lot of complaints here that the original pilot was never released....   The pilot was included on the european release so those of you with multiregion players should pay the extra and get that one from amazon.co.uk... <br /> <br />A sympathetic european :)

B000687M48|4.0|Evanescence live in Paris, they played most of the songs from the album \\"Fallen\\", and Evanescence used to means \\"Amy Lee + Ben Moody\\", and now Moody left and replaced by ex-Cold Terry Balsamo, Evanescence now sound more like a whole band and every members put efforts into songs that they changed some of the arrangements of songs, make songs feel a little bit different from the album version, which is good.  <br /> <br />Tracks like \\"Haunted\\", \\"Going Under\\" is difinitely great opening tracks, and they made Korn's \\"Thoughtless\\" sound great, too. and they stick \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"Tourniquet\\" into one song is really head-turning, but \\"Farther Away\\" and \\"Breathe No More\\" are not as great as those \\"Fallen\\" tracks, the melodies are weak on that two i'm afraid. <br /> <br />as a live concert DVD, i'll be more happy if i can really see them play, but the music video kinda production/editing is not focus on the band, but the whole musical climax, which is not bad just i don't like it, i'd prefer focus more on each member in order to see more on how they really play their instruments. if you are familiar with their songs, but not familiar with their faces and gears, this DVD can't help..... if that's the case.
B00028HBKC|5.0|As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father, I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds, possibly thousands of times.  However, nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Spectacular, very entertaining, magical. Completely takes you away from anything you've ever seen before and enters a world you never believed existed. Depp and Winslet bring the screen alive with things you never thought possible. Absolutely wonderful, fun and moving. It's a must see!
B0006399FS|5.0|This is a really solid album.  It features more guitar than recent releases and has very little of that techno pop stuff.  The song Fast Cars,included on the release with the dvd/and book is good.  (the book is not).  In my opinion (but after only 5 or 6 listens)this album is better than Achtung Baby.  Enjoy.
6302891272|3.0|I am a once again a student from Nagoya International School and was given the opportunity to observe and comment on the Japanese version of Shakespeare's Macbeth.   <br />Everyone enjoys a little variety, but variety is not always preferred of enjoyed.  In my opinion, the variation that was made, recreating Macbeth into a Japanese version was not very favored.  It was an effective choice for certain reasons I do believe; however, there were many disappointing points as well. <br />Having the Throne of Blood set in Japan was an effective choice.  This is because of several reasons, one being the fact that Japanese castles, clothes, make-up, everything in the old times were eerie.  This emphasized a daunting atmosphere, foreshadowing the evil to come further into the film.  The evil spirit who represented the witch from original version of \\"Macbeth\\" was especially bloodcurdling as well as Lady Macbeth who was presented as if she were a character from a horror movie.  The deep forests and the dim, candle lit rooms enhanced the mood of the film.  Since olden Japan was the antithesis of America, it was an effective choice to present the film so that the audience could enjoy the story from a different perspective.  The black and white was effective like the original version of Macbeth.  It conveys a mysterious atmosphere, ideal to the concept of the story. <br />There were several plot changes that were identifiable.  First of all, Lady Macbeth did not commit suicide.  Maybe this was because the notion of committing suicide was too harsh and violent to the audience back then.  Also, there were no murderers who were ordered to kill the character similar to Banquo and it seemed to be a slight loss of effect to not have had the scene in which Banquo was killed.  Third thing I realized was that there really were no witches, but a lady who represented the evil spirit.  From what I know, Japan does not really focus/talk about witches but believe in evil spirits and ghosts.  Therefore, this change may have been some what of an adaptation made so that the film would be suitable to the Japanese audience.   <br />In my opinion, the portrayal of Macbeth was unsatisfactory.  He seemed too eager and boisterous at all times.  I never got the impression that he was even once courageous, admired and strong.  He yelled almost throughout the whole movie making it difficult for me to understand what he was saying and also, the yelling did not suit some of the scenes.  However, he was perfect at portraying the frantic Macbeth towards the end of the film.  The yelling then was appropriate.   <br />The portrayal of Lady Macbeth was reasonable.  She seemed too ethereal, not at all feminine, the way Lady Macbeth was in the American version of the film.  Her make-up and movements, as well as the things she said quietly just made her look like she was haunting Macbeth throughout the whole film.  Maybe though, as a Japanese woman, she did a decent job.  This is because some Japanese women in those days were actually that silent.  In my opinion, to make the film more interesting, I would have preferred more emotion from Lady Macbeth as well as more freedom in movement.   <br />The violence in the film was too planned.  Very typical Japanese violence, I must say.  The acting from my point of view was very pitiable looking and unexciting.  As a matter of fact, there was actually no violence at all!  Only words of battles.  There was no blood shed and very little action.  The director and the actors as well should have made a better effort to make the violent scenes more realistic and effective, for we, the audience did not see any meaning in the violent scenes.   <br />Overall, as I mentioned above, I found this Japanese version of Macbeth unsatisfactory.  It was amusing to be able to enjoy the story through different characters as well as slight plot changes; however, I'd much rather prefer the American version over the Japanese version.  It is not necessarilya film I recommend to people who expect a decent \\"movie\\" but I will recommend it to those who are interested in a different version of Macbeth. <br />
B0006A9FMI|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater. First of all i will say that the visuals are awsome. The opening is everything you would want in a second edition to the series. The blend of 3d and 2d works so nicely in this. The movie follows after the first film where the Major is dead..uh..i mean evolved in the internet.. and Batou is now the focus as he investigates machines that are used for sexual pleasure that are killing their owners/clients or whatever. If you are an action junkie you might be annoyed by the following, there are only two real action scenes in the entire film, BUT they are good. Of course continuing in its information overload trend GITS2 has lots of robot philosophy going on, enough to make you pass out. The plot flows nicely, except for one very confusing and annoying scene in a mansion before the second action scene. I do think that this movie is worth buying because of the amazing visuals, the storyline will keep you awake (hopefully) and the music is very good. There is a nice revelation to the plot in the ending.  Do partake.
B00006879E|5.0|I don't own this album (yet), but I have heard at least bits and pieces of most of the songs. I think it's awesome, although it imitates some older groups as some have said. Not horrible to put a fresh new twist on an old concept, eh? Most music these days has been done before. <br /> <br />Glad we can share our opinions here without being called things like unintelligent and idiotic.
068987474X|5.0|I loved this book.  Instead of things like \\"How To Make A Man Fall Madly In Love With You\\" and other tripe, the authors (a man and a woman) show you how to weed through the BS and see that a)no matter what you do, you can't change the way someone feels about you; and b)most of the heartache we go through and the excuses offered by men for their behavior boils down to a simple root cause: he's just not that into you.  It's a theory I've been testing in my life for a few years now, after getting fed up with working my ass off to please men and be a good mate, and getting left waiting by the proverbial phone, I'm seeing that if he's not living up to my expectations, he's history, and quick.  For those of you who have read books like \\"The Rules\\" and thought they were a bunch of antiquated submissive crap (like me) this gives some brilliant advice while still empowering women.  I just wanted to see a man's perspective on this theory, and this book more or less affirmed what I have put into practice in my life.  While I'm not in a serious relationship at the moment (but am seeing someone with great potential), I am happier than I ever was when I was chasing after men, trying to \\"make\\" them love me.  It's a serious confidence boost to wake up, dump that loser who doesn't call when he says he will, and walk with your head held high.  This book will help if you need the motivation to do that.  Good luck, ladies!
B00005JNEI|1.0|I cannot believe that someone can make this type of \\"documentary\\" (and I use the term loosely, as \\"pack of lies\\" would be more appropriate), inject it with all kinds of lies and manipulation of facts, and make so much money from it.  I have no respect for someone who becomes a millionaire criticizing his own government based on lies but then praises communist countries (Cuba) that deny the very freedom (freedom of speech) that allowed him to become so wealthy.  If you must see this movie, PLEASE see \\"Fahrenhype 9/11\\" right afterwards.  That way you will get the REAL story, and you'll get to see all the fabrications that Michael Moore would like you to believe as fact.  And in fact, \\"Fahrenhype 9/11\\" is a lot more interesting than Moore's movie, which most of the time just drags on.  Of course, that is when it is not cheaply exploiting the images of our soldiers.
0393035158|4.0|Judging from the volume of  responses, Harris has touched a raw nerve. That's not surprising. For too long, religious belief has gotten an intellectual free ride from a democratic tradition that too often confuses tolerance with avoidance of criticism. The result is a popular culture now awash in religious superstition and science illiteracy, in short, a society of 16th century beliefs amidst 21st century tecnology. Harris does a genuine service in exposing these dangerous absurdities, whose Muslim offshoot may be historically more complex, but no less menacing. Had Harris stayed with this focus, his writing skills would have produced a little gem. Unfortunately, the book's second half undertakes a compressed series of topics outlining a path towards a more enlightened, humane society. This may be a laudable goal, but the topcs are altogether too complex for the author's brief and sometimes cursory treatment. For example, Harris embraces moral realism (moral truths independent of consciousness). Yet nowhere does he raise the central issue of whether this type of moral theory escapes the kind of metaphysical backing he would no doubt reject. I'm sure he is aware of this problem, yet this intensely controversial issue is stripped of its controversy and treated as unproblematical. Moreover, Harris separates spirituality from religion, a very necessary and timely distinction. Nonetheless, his abbreviated quasi-Buddhist experiment in collapsing the \\"I\\", may mislead readers into equating spirituality with the absence of thought and the ego. This outcome is interesting, but is also at odds with an equally persuasive view that equates spirituality with the highest individual achievements of thought, namely, artistic and intellectual accomplishment. Despite such pitfalls and a really muddled section on intuition, the book remains well worth the read, especially if the second half is taken as a stimulus for further research. Moreover, no book that provocatively searches out the moral equivalency of collateral damage with the practice of torture can afford to be overlooked.
B0006399FS|5.0|I would bet my life or at least a leg of mine that the critics giving these undeserving 1 and 2 stars, have either not heard the album or maybe heard it once or twice, and that is so idiotic to judge so harshly so soon. I have been a huge fan dating back to the War album as well, but I can not quite understand what exactly the blinded critics expected from U2. This album is an emotional journey into the soul of any who truly listens and really takes to heart the lyrics. To be honest I was not to impressed at all on my first few listens and then BAM it hit me like a \\"bullet train\\". This album is more than just great new music by one of, if not the, greatest bands of all time, yet it is a soundtrack for all aspects of life, and not just certain peoples life, but everyone who has a pulse and set of working ears, and a brain that is more developed than the cry baby, illiterate, so quick to critisise, William Hung lovin 1 stars and you all know it. You all should listen to the album more closely if your simple minds can follow that is. It's ironic that the album you so harshly and wrongly put down will most likely take album of the year. Do you haters realize who you are talking about? U2 have been successful so long for a reason, because they know how to create style and change. Honestly though who wants them to recreate the 80's sound to a t? That would be career suicide, yet instead they have screamed without raising their voice. If you are debating the purchase of this album just take my advice and do it, and if you choose not to that's ok too, just means I have a better chance of getting great floor seats when they come to Dallas, and that's all good. THEY DID IT AGAIN...WAY TO GO U2!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0345423496|1.0|I grew up on Clarke. His novels and short stories fuelled my avid interest in science, evolution, and academic pursuits. It used to be that I could not wait to read the latest Clarke edition.    But the last good books Mr. Clarke has written were 2010 and Fountains of Paradise.  All subsequent books by Mr. Clarke, including 3001 have lacked the ingenuity and sense of wonder present in his earlier work (i.e. Childhoods End, Rendezvous with Rama, Expedition to Earth).  I thought that 2061: Odyssey Three was the low point of Clarke's writing, but 3001 is nothing more than a \\"cut and paste\\" job from all the intruiging ideas explored by Mr. Clarke in previous books. The notes at the end of 3001 are more interesting that the actual story, and most of those notes appeared in the much earlier (and brilliant) Fountains of Paradise.    My advice to those that loved 2001 and hated 2061, give this book a miss.    Postscript    I originally reviewed this book anonymously in 1997, right after it came out.  I reread it again recently, and had to stop.  It really was not worth it.
B000068IEU|1.0|Last House on the Left is one of those infamous movies that people talk about but no-one ever actually saw. It's never on TV and I had begun to think it was more myth than real until I finally saw it. Right away I realized that it' loosely based on Ingemar Bergman's Virgin Spring which is about a tighly controlled man who realizes that the two travelers sleeping in his barn are actually responsible for the murder and rape of his favorite child. What should he do? What would you do? Later as a twist you wonder what will God do?  <br /> <br />That movie was a chilly Swedish classic. Last House is just grue, it's grand guinol, it's essentially as close to a snuff film as most folks would ever want to get. And it's poorly acted to boot. Wes Craven, who obviously went on to better things must have gotten these actors off the street and paid them with lunch.  <br /> <br />Two young girls are kidnapped, raped, tortured and killed. The rape and torture goes on for a very long time. There is a disembowling scene and it's long and the camera lingers in a close shot of the intestines. Fun stuff, eh? Not to me. Later the parents of one of the girls finds out and go after the crazed drifters who did the deed.  <br /> <br />If your taste in horror runs towards ghosts, vamps, werewolves and the nameless thing in the dark Last House is not for you. Either pass it by or watch Virgin Spring instead.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Being a former cast member of Saturday Night Live doesn't guarantee a comedian a real chance of movie stardom.  For every Mike Myers, there is a Jimmy Fallon (attn:  Mr. Fallon---big mistake leaving SNL).  Fortunately Will Farrell is not one of those guys that will fall to the wayside.  He proves this with \\"Elf\\", a charming Christmas tale perfectly suited for him.<br /><br />  In this story a young baby accidently ends up in Santa's bag of toys and is taken back to the north pole.  The child is raised by one of the lead Elves (played by the wonderful Bob Newhart) until Buddy (Farrell) realizes he must find his real father.<br /><br />  The journey takes Buddy to New York where his work driven father (James Caan) finds out he has an adult soon and is, of course, convinced that his son, who believes he is an elf, is a complete nut case.  Will Farrell's innocent portrayal of Buddy is perfect and he makes the character lovable.  I hope this film finds its way into the list of Christmas classics that we see on TV every December during the holiday season.  It certainly deserves to be. I recommend this film for all---a funny movie to enjoy with family or friends.
1401300901|1.0|This book is so bad that if I hadn't had to read it for work, I wouldn't have got past the first chapter. Painfully clunky prose, terrible jokes and moronic characters make it one to avoid - it's not in the slightest bit moving, and the only laughs are strictly unintentional.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|Ok where do i start with the very crappy album, well first off this group is not that good, I mean Axel Rose is the worst frontman of all time, hes just some raciest who can scream a lot. I do like some of the guitar work but you can bearlly hear it with Axel singing <br /> <br />Now about the lyrics of these songs. I mean these songs have nothing going for them. I mean just listen to Welcome to the Jungle. The only songs that have good lyrics are the songs that this band coverd (and falled to do a good job with) <br /> <br />Also this group comes from what is the worst decade of music i can remeber which is the 80's (there was some good music but not much). <br /> <br />So if you want to get a good cdi would recomend something by The Beatles or Radiohead or even The Clash but not this band
0792838068|1.0|I generally steer away from a Disney movie. And Mary Poppins for the Grandkids? I'll leave the room. Lifetime channel where all men are beasts and women are out on the front lines trying to preserve civilization. Keep it. But I also draw the line at 100 million dollar films that want to tell me that life is hard. I have learned this. And I've also learned that alcohol, in some hands, kills. It kills the person who drinks it and it often kills the people around him or her. It is as much a disease as cancer, MS or emphysema. I don't need a brilliant actor to show me what's under the rock. I've seen under the rock. It isn't very pretty. Nor should you.<br /><br />That Nick Cage wins an oscar and Shue should have, should not be the criteria for this novel turned movie about two weak people who lacked the courage to turn their lives around. That's the movie. Human courage in the face of adversity. Failing. Losing. Not the ultimate giving up. Not the peddling of your flesh and your soul. I missed the gun at the head of Cage or the noose around the neck of Shue, urging them to continue degrading themselves. No. The criteria for this movie should be John O'Brien, the author, who committed suicide before the movie was completed.<br /><br />Sorry. I don't get it. Struggled with it. I don't know why people would be interested in it. Tell me in 20 years if it's brilliant, or just a lot of Hollywood people jumping on the ooing and aahhing band wagon. People ought to come to their senses. 1 star. Larry Scantlbury
B00003CXI0|5.0|This is a review coming from a kid who gets scared of a lot of things, yet this movie was incredible! It does have a few scary moments, but it is also extremely good! The first of the three Harry Potter movies currently out, it is still the best of them all. Take a pinch of comedy, a dash of action, and a small handfull of mystery, you get a potion of a movie that will knock your socks off!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Television has been reviled for years and quite deservedly so. It is the most beautiful of persons, now walking the streets for cheap thrills and money.It is the brilliant chemists and doctors who can remove pain from the elderly, now turning out liters of poison for cash. But once in awhile, television does something so inspiring, so incredible, so extraordinary, that we are left speechless. Such is Band of Brothers.<br /><br />Henry the Fifth continues with his monologue, 'for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.' They changed the world. Without them, Normandy was in doubt. Bastogne was in doubt. Berlin was in doubt. Europe was in doubt. The world was in doubt.<br /><br />I have to chuckle at some of the detractors to this brilliant compendium of the story of Easy Company, 101st Airborne, that we Americans think too highly of ourselves. Damn right!<br /><br />The remarkable thing about Easy company and the 101st  . . . and the guys that flew the hump in India, and the guys that gave close air support at Guadacanal, and the guys that held the line at Bastogne, is just that. They were just guys. No Stallone. No Duke. No Chuck Norris. These guys were from Decatur and Compton and Farmingdale and Bloomington and Tulsa and Omaha and the Ypsilanti.They were car mechanics and conductors on subways and teachers and kids who lied about their age while still in high school.<br /><br />This is the most remarkable thing ever put on television. Are there better shows? I don't know. Not many. 10 stars wouldn't be enough. I envy you if you haven't seen it although I've seen it 3 times and it still puts tears in my eyes. Larry Scantlebury
B00005JMAH|4.0|The 3rd Potter movie was not nearly as good as the first two. I hope Columbus comes back for the last 4 that need to be done. I don't know about you, but I don't think this new idiot watched the first two movies closely enough. I might have liked it if it weren't for the fact that I am used to the first two movies, therefore I thought that this movie wasn't true to Harry's character. Everything is way out of place compared to the HP's 1&2. Oh well, I know he's not directing the fourth movie, and I hope he's not doing five, six, and seven, either.
B000001FDQ|5.0|This is one of the best albums I own of any genre. I first heard it back in 1984, hot off the press. Only two tracks have vocals -- the music stands on its own.  Very medieval and haunting...favorite track is \\"Icarus' Dream Suite\\", but all the tracks are treasures.   Worth its weight in gold.  A classic.  True musicianship.  Yngwie always said that music is timeless and he simply plays what he wants to play, that being on the bandwagon everyone else is on as far as \\"popular\\" music goes never appealed to him, and due to this I have a high respect for him as an artist.  Flawless guitar playing, atmospheric, pure magic.
B00006879E|5.0|This band is not at all like your average boy band.  Did you ever hear BackStreet boys sing intamatly about love or rock out on the gutar?  Didnt think so.  All of the songs on this album are great.  None of them are bubble gum pop, the are all straight alternative rock.  Highly Reccomended!!
B0006399FS|5.0|Any U2 record takes at least a week before conclusions can be drawn. A couple hundred people here jumped the gun.<br /><br />\\"Vertigo\\" - Their best single in a long time - probably since<br /><br />\\"One\\"<br /><br />Miracle Drug - Great hooks and lyricism. \\"Freedom has a scent like the top of a newborn baby's head.\\" If you have never had a child or a baby brother/sister, you wouldn't understand.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes...\\" - A remarkably mature song about the complications of growing up with a dad. The falsetto was a bit off-putting at first, but grew on me.  Excellent bridge saves the song from falling asleep and makes it a winner.<br /><br />\\"Love & Peace\\" - U2 meets bluesy Led Zep.  How could THAT be bad?<br /><br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" - My favorite so far. Wrings out all the emotion that was put into it. U2 does this well all the time (as any concert experience with them will bear out), but sometimes the transcendent emotion superconducts. Almost makes you want to move to NYC.<br /><br />\\"All Because of You\\" - Beatlesesque hook.  A great rock song as well as a great U2 song.<br /><br />\\"Man and a Woman\\" - New sound but hearkens back to older stuff.  Great song.<br /><br />\\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" - Afflicting the comfortable into comforting the afflicted.  Biting prophetic never sounded so good. Great guitar hook and good medicine for what ails us spoiled White Westerners.<br /><br />\\"One Step Closer\\" - Mature song about dying from the same country that brought us \\"Danny Boy.\\"  Pretty tough sell on a rock album, but we tacitly acknowledge our own demise every time we look at a clock. Heidegger called us beings unto death and the Irish do death songs better than anyone.<br /><br />\\"Original of the Species\\" - Transcendent song about that most mundane institution.  Marriage is the toughest job you'll ever love and Bono has logged the years with Ali to earn a voice.<br /><br />\\"Yahweh\\" - \\"But,\\" said Moses to God, \\"when I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' if they ask me, 'What is his name?' what am I to tell them?\\" God replied, \\"I am who am.\\" Then he added, \\"This is what you shall tell the Israelites: I AM (Heb. YHWH = Yahweh) sent me to you.\\" (Exodus 3:14-15) More a Psalm than a song.  This is a great compliment to \\"Grace\\" from ATYCLB and \\"40\\" from WAR.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE - Dave (Edge) returns to the Guitar with style, Paul (Bono) spills his guts in a way that is inspiring and not embarassing, Adam and Larry maintenance the bottom end with brilliant simplicity. This is the most consistent U2 record since Joshua Tree and best since Achtung Baby.s and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' if they ask me, 'What is his name?' what am I to tell them?\\" God replied, \\"I am who am.\\" Then he added, \\"This is what you shall tell the Israelites: I AM (Heb. YHWH = Yahweh) sent me to you.\\" (Exodus 3:14-15) More a Psalm than a song.  This is a great compliment to \\"Grace\\" from ATYCLB and \\"40\\" from WAR. <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE - Dave (Edge) returns to the Guitar with style, Paul (Bono) spills his guts in a way that is inspiring and not embarassing, Adam and Larry maintenance the bottom end with brilliant simplicity. This is the most consistent U2 record since Joshua Tree and best since Achtung Baby. <br />
B000002UAU|5.0|BEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME. No other album has the same emotional lyrics of \\"she's leaving home.\\" Or the humor of \\"When I'm 64.\\" No other album has the melodic rock/pop structure of \\"Lovely Rita\\" with it's magnificant piano solo. Or the hard rock riff of \\"Sgt Pepper\\" or the cozy feeling of \\"with a little help from my friend.\\" No other album takes you through stunning imagary and balladry of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" or \\"A day in the life.\\" This album belongs in every music collection. No matter what your taste is. You need to own this album!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This was so funny! I have watched it three times in the last 24 hours. Buddy is so innocent and funny. The scene in NY where he eats the gum is worth the entire movie! As well as the \\"angry elf\\" scene!  Buy it!!!!
B0006399FS|4.0|I've been absorbing the mixed reviews on this album.  Initially, I was dissapointed as well, and felt that U2 was \\"mailing it in\\" on \\"Bomb.\\" Like so many other albums these days, it seemed repetetive, dull, and listless--all of the Rock cliches people use to describe an album they don't like.  <br /> <br />Hold the fort... <br /> <br />Take another listen. Two. And then three. It starts to grow on a body.  <br /> <br />Frankly, after repeated listenings, I like it more than \\"Achtung Baby.\\" In fact, to confirm that scary thought, I played the two back to back. \\"Bomb\\" came out on top. I'm nuts you say?   <br /> <br />Perhaps, but this collection to my mind is more \\"accessible\\" (for lack of a better term). Perhaps a bit softer. Easier.  <br /> <br />It doesn't have a classic Rock anthem on it, such as \\"One.\\" What it does have, simply, is a collection of good songs. Not *very* good. Just good. But taken as a whole--just being \\"good,\\" if you're U2, doesn't seem so bad.  <br /> <br />Some may think that a new body of work in the life/evolution of one of the great rock bands of all time should be more. At first listen, I felt the same way.  But the 3rd or 4th time around, I felt I was starting to understand this album, and I think that most U2 fans with an open mind and heart will feel the same way. I couldn't help but think that these guys still got it goin' on.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002AP1|4.0|This is great album from top to bottom. Gimme Danger , Search And Destroy , Hard To Beat are all top notch. Penetration has got a great feel to it with the keys in the background. To me the albums strongest song is I Need Somebody , a bluesy kinda thing . Every time I hear the Stooges name mentioned or I read a review of one of their albums ,the comparison to the punk bands of mid 70s - early 80s comes up. I couldn't disagree more . The stooges are talented. Thier songs are well crafted and interesting... and Ron Asheton is great guitar player and doesn't get nearly the credit he deserves .<br />Don't confuse The Stooges with the three chord wonder bands who call themselves punk. These guys can flat out play. The only negative on this album is that the recording is so bad its unlistenable. Not even a good remastering could save this . But this is still a very, very good album.
0061020710|4.0|This is the fisrt installemnt in the discworld series, and introduces the reader to the city of anhk morpork (a analogy of early london, during the industrial revolution), rincewind, the inept wizzard, who has one of the eight great spells in him, plus two flower the orginal tourist probably based on an american tourist. The book flows well, for first readers of pratchet, dont expect chapters, and read the footnotes, they help explain the book as you go along. The humour is mainly british. overall a good book. But a note of merit, some people if like or hate pratchett, if you are feeling a bit indifferent perservere, or read another of his titles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000CDL93|5.0|[This review is based upon the VHS copy of \\"JFK: The Director's Cut\\".     However, I recommend this two-disc DVD for the additional documentary material it brings to the table.  - Doug Peschka] <br /> <br />Since before \\"JFK\\" was first released in 1991, the national media have been jumping  <br />all over Oliver Stone's case for not making a historically accurate documentary. <br /> <br />HELLO!   Oliver Stone said himself that never was his intention to begin with !!! <br /> <br />Folks, this movie is not about the actual facts of who really killed John Kennedy and why. <br />It's all about the value of every conscientious American thinking for themselves and questioning authority. <br /> <br />And that's what \\"JFK\\" does - it makes you think for yourself and ask your own questions, <br />and do your own thinking.   On that merit alone, it would make John Kennedy - and Robert Kennedy - both very proud. <br /> <br />That is what our schools' history books should do.   Not just feed us the official line that \\"A lone nut named Oswald did it alone\\".  But a present us with all of the known facts, and an encouragement to all students - and to all the American People - to search for the truth themselves. <br /> <br />In a book called Proverbs, we are reminded that \\"Where there is no vision, the people perish.\\" <br /> <br />Nothing is more important than facing the world with our eyes and minds open. <br />That is the central meaning of \\"JFK\\".   When I sat in the theater in early 1992 and watched <br />\\"JFK\\" I thought of the important words of Jackson Browne's 1987 hit \\"Lives In The Balance\\": <br /> <br />\\"You might ask what it takes to remember <br />when you know that you've seen it before, <br />where a government lies to a people <br />and a country is drifting to war. <br /> <br />They sell us the President the same way <br />they sell us our clothes and our cars. <br />They sell us everything from Youth to Religion <br />the same time they sell us our wars. <br /> <br/>I want to know who the men in the shadows are <br />I want to hear somebody asking them why <br />they can be counted on to tell us who our enemies are <br />but they're never the ones to fight or to die.\\" <br /> <br />No, not all of \\"JFK\\" is fact.   But it does contain more truths <br />than the Warren Report does. <br /> <br />Question Authority. <br /> <br />While you still can. <br />
0061020680|5.0|This is the first novel which features DEATH (all of his words in the discword series are in capitals), it deals with his struggle to understand humanity, and his taking on of an apprentice Mort (short for mortimer). The footnotes are intrested and so is Albert who would deep fry porridge if you let him. This book deals alot with the mortality of life. Plus it also shows the corruption of the soul by power, unless you are an anthromorphic personification. A love intrest is also included with mort showing an intrest in deaths daughter (adopted). Also the colur scheme is interesting (black). A good read for someone interested in discworld.
B0006399FS|5.0|I have been a fan of this band for a long time, and can say with some authority that this new album is one of their best. Like ACHTUNG BABY, the first single (\\"The Fly\\" from ACHTUNG BABY, \\"Vertigo\\" from this album) is one that grows on you; when you first hear it you think it isn't really like U2, but then it seems to get better and better. Meanwhile there are some songs on this album that grab you by the lapels right off, like \\"All because of you.\\" Anyway the moral of the story is that this is very good music, at a time when most bands are not putting out good stuff but going on the road anyway and charging too much for tickets. I just hope Bono and the boys choose to come to my town when they tour. GET IT!
B00006BNDI|5.0|1. Det Som En Gang Var      - What Once Was   <br />2. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss        - Before The Light Took Us <br />3. Im I Slottet Fra Droemmen        - Into The Castle Of Dreams <br />4. Tomhet  - [Into] Emptiness <br /> <br />This album, like most of his work is completely misunderstood. The album plays out like a war cry, faithfully expressing Varg's vision of what's happened to, what he considers, the superior Aryan race and the transformation of ideals and ethics over the years. It expresses his lust for a return to the purity of ancient times. It also expresses his pain in dealing with the apparent fact that this purity will never again exist, among other issues such as the effect of Christian values on the pagan soul. Like all of his work, this is very abstract. The best way to describe it is: unpredictable and unconventional. The music is unique and the concept is brilliant.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|There was never a time when i thought the plot was intended to go somewhere entertaining, so i wasnt suprised when the movie was over and i was pissed. This was a very long student art film that had me watching the clock and waiting to be entertained. although it offers deeper meaning, it fails to produce anything visual or audio that can be remembered. why, oh why couldnt sophia just have written a book and saved my time?
B00008S2VG|1.0|It's too bad Madge doesn't come the realization that she is just a \\"very\\" average vocalist who hasn't been blessed with a great voice. She tries here, but fails because the material is so weak. Plus she has the nerve to take a stab at rapping. My sides were splitting from laughing so hard. It looks like she's in dire need of a big time producer here. It may help her music  sound passable. American Life has a low budget sound and suffers from way too much overdubbing. I think it's time to pack it all in and try another career altogether.
B00068IOWC|5.0|How do you qualify an artist as \\"great\\"? <br /> <br />I'll tell you how.  There are two criteria to a master artist.  First, they experiment with new and creative ways to express their feelings.  This is something U2 has done to great effect over their first 20 years.  By reinventing themselves with each new album, they've performed classics in nearly every genre of pop music running the gamut from \\"One\\" to \\"Desire.\\"  This is a qualification that everyone has, and all the people that didn't like this album are totally focusing on this, because the band doesn't seem to reinvent themselves here. <br /> <br />That being said, the other important measure of a great artist is defining a certain work, and perfecting it.  I believe that a young U2 created a distinctive sound in \\"Joshua Tree\\", a sound and a feeling that no one had ever pounded out before, and to me, that became a signature style.  As this band has matured, they've experimented, tried new things, and with 2000's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", they brought themselves back to a sound they invented, writing amazing music.  They're aging, maturing, and now seemingly perfecting their original work.  This is something that should not be lost on today's U2 fans, but seemingly is. <br /> <br />This album is fantastic.  Top to bottom.  We've come full circle, from an Irish teenage frustration band, to a politically charged hit machine to bringing alternative sounds to the masses and industrial skronk and techno beats in the unstable nineties to a Beautiful Day of their own making.  Genius.  For those of you who are disappointed that this album doesn't \\"rock\\", I'm sorry, but that's just not the authentic U2 sound.  They're fully capable of that kind of effort, but what they do best is what they do best and it's in full force on this album. <br /> <br />This is a renaissance of an often-copied, but never fully mastered sound brought to bear by the world's preeminent rock band.  Genius.  Song by song - <br /> <br />Vertigo:  This song rocks.  Simply put.  Just because this album is about perfecting a certain sound doesn't mean they exclude experimentation and other genres.  Lots of energy, hyped like crazy, very good. <br /> <br />Miracle Drug:  Will grow on you.  Beautiful lyrics.  I expect this one to gain stature as time goes on. <br /> <br />Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own:  Heard it first on SNL and was captivated.  The falsetto chorus with Edge is great.  The next great ballad for this group. <br /> <br />Love and Peace or Else:  Don't like it much at all.  To be fair though, it's just not my style.  Too fuzzy sounding.  Too heavy I think. <br /> <br />City of Blinding Lights:  As a New Yorker, I think this is up there with Joel's \\"New York State of Mind\\" as the soundtrack to this city.  Gorgeous.  This captures that \\"Streets Have No Name\\", \\"Walk On\\" sound that I think defines the band.  The signature ringing lead guitar is evident here as the backbone of the song.  The best track on the disc. <br /> <br />All Because of You:  Fun, throwback song.  Not terribly deep, not too notable, but enjoyable. <br /> <br />*A Man and a Woman*:  This song is SERIOUSLY underrated by every review on this site.  Very sexy, smooth sound.  The bass line is fantastic.  For all those clamoring for new sounds, here it is, and they pull it off with flair.  I mean, this has the sound like all the successful Rock/R&B acts - Stevie Wonder, ELO, now Maroon 5.  Highly enjoyable.  The flow from verse to chorus is beautiful. <br /> <br />Crumbs From Your Table:  I have read many reviews saying this is the standout track.  I cannot for the life of me figure out why.  I think it's somewhat bland.  Really.  It's only been a week, so there very likely is something I'm missing here, but as of right now I'm just not feeling it. <br /> <br />One Step Closer:  Least favorite track.  Totally unnoticeable.  Really very down sounding in the middle of such a high passion album.  I get no feeling here. <br /> <br />Original of the Species:  Okay, but not really making any differences here.  It meanders too much.  A little too complicated, maybe it's the production, maybe the lyrics, something.  Has potential for a live recording. <br /> <br />Yahweh:  I get the feeling that this could have been better, but I really am happy with it the way it is.  It's soulful, simple.  Chorus could be improved, but really a fine finisher. <br /> <br /> <br />This is NOT a sex and drugs band.  This group speaks for a whole generation of people because of what they talk about in \\"Man and a Woman\\" - love and faith and sex and fear.  This band creates a soundtrack for life, death, love, mortality, healing, solitude, joy, depth, fear, sorrow and just having a good time.  At their very best here, is a mature band perfecting their signature sound.  In the perfect follow up to All That You Can't Leave Behind, which started this renaissance, U2 takes that emotion to a whole new level.  Hats off to the greatest rock and roll band in the universe - they've done it again.
B0002Y4TM4|2.0|I stopped buying Marillion after 'Made Again' and gave up on them after the wretched 'Afraid of sunlight'. It doesn't seem that I missed much. Marillion I fear never got over the loss of Fish and with each cd it appears to be the case. Steve H's vocals will either thrill you or irritate you depending on your mood. I have never gotten used to his voice despite repeated listenings. I did like 'Brave' but only because the music was particularly good. 'Marbles' is a strange one, way too many introspective slower tracks and not enough rockers. It's a laid back disc a bit like 'Brave'. The longer tracks: 1 & 11 work better than the whole of the disc. The band puts in a good performance but nothing that requires repeated listenings sorry to say. Sound quality is very good. Full booklet/lyrics/credits plus a video of 'Don't hurt yourself'. 11 tracks/64.11.
B0006399FS|5.0|How do you qualify an artist as \\"great\\"? <br /> <br />I'll tell you how. There are two criteria to a master artist. First, they experiment with new and creative ways to express their feelings. This is something U2 has done to great effect over their first 20 years. By reinventing themselves with each new album, they've performed classics in nearly every genre of pop music running the gamut from \\"One\\" to \\"Desire.\\" This is a qualification that everyone has, and all the people that didn't like this album are totally focusing on this, because the band doesn't seem to reinvent themselves here. <br /> <br />That being said, the other important measure of a great artist is defining a certain work, and perfecting it. I believe that a young U2 created a distinctive sound in \\"Joshua Tree\\", a sound and a feeling that no one had ever pounded out before, and to me, that became a signature style. As this band has matured, they've experimented, tried new things, and with 2000's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", they brought themselves back to a sound they invented, writing amazing music. They're aging, maturing, and now seemingly perfecting their original work. This is something that should not be lost on today's U2 fans, but seemingly is. <br /> <br />This album is fantastic. Top to bottom. We've come full circle, from an Irish teenage frustration band, to a politically charged hit machine to bringing alternative sounds to the masses and industrial skronk and techno beats in the unstable nineties to a Beautiful Day of their own making. Genius. For those of you who are disappointed that this album doesn't \\"rock\\", I'm sorry, but that's just not the authentic U2 sound. They're fully capable of that kind of effort, but what they do best is what they do best and it's in full force on this album. <br /> <br />This is a renaissance of an often-copied, but never fully mastered sound brought to bear by the world's preeminent rock band. Genius. Song by song - <br /> <br />Vertigo: This song rocks. Simply put. Just because this album is about perfecting a certain sound doesn't mean they exclude experimentation and other genres. Lots of energy, hyped like crazy, very good. <br /> <br />Miracle Drug: Will grow on you. Beautiful lyrics. I expect this one to gain stature as time goes on. <br /> <br />Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own: Heard it first on SNL and was captivated. The falsetto chorus with Edge is great.

B00005JLEX|5.0|Okay, maybe the title of this review was a little over-the-top, but I just can't help it. This show was the lone wolf of television sitcoms. Nothing was like it then, and nothing is like it now. I called it the \\"lone wolf\\" sitcom, because it was out there. Uncoventional? Yes, most definitely. \\"Seinfeld\\" broke all the barriers for all the other television sitcoms that followed. I mean come on. Name one show from 1989 and back that got away with what Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David wrote.<br /><br />Anyway, this DVD collection contains all original episodes from seasons 1 and 2. Uncut, remastered, and oh, so awesome. The special features on these discs are fantastic. All jammed pack with an hour or so long documentary, which for those who didn't watch Thanksgiving night was the special that aired that night except this is the unedited version of the documentary. Each discs also contains an \\"Inside Look\\" into the story of certain episodes and has interviews with all the casts members and writers with whom share their experience of that particular episode with us.<br /><br />Well....there is alot here to talk about, but I'm just going to say that if you do not own this DVD set, then I urge you to pick it up. This show was innovative and one of the funniest sitcoms I've ever seen.
0385510438|4.0|I was a little suspect when I read the reviews but had to read it since I have read all the others. I was pleasantly surprised. It has good courtroom drama, some good suspense, and some real life personalities. Growing up in the South myself I could identify with the characters. The part about the big chain store coming in and gobbling up all the small mom and pop merchants is what we saw in the `80s with Wal Mart through out the south in many smaller towns. The ending was a bit disappointing; I wish he had gone on about the main character's life after the funeral instead of leaving it to our imaginations. But I enjoyed it, it's a good relaxing read.

B00028HBKM|4.0|I am not a \\"religious\\" person, however, I felt it was important to see this movie.  If nothing else, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. <br /> <br />After sitting through a very quiet showing, my wife and I got up and walked out without saying a word.  It took a while for the movie to sink in.  Nobody was talking as they left the theatre. <br /> <br />It was a moving experience.  Graphic and disturbing.  Something I am glad that I sat through, but can't see adding this to my movie collection. <br /> <br />More interesting than the movie itself, is the reaction of those who liked or disliked it.  Reading the reviews of this movie is a great way to see the cultural divide in our country.
B000089RVX|3.0|Overall, I think this is a pretty good CD, particularly by nu-metal/mainstream rock standards. Amys voice is very strong on the CD, and the lyrics are suprisingly very good as well. But the band behind her leaves a lot to be desired. The guitar, drums and bass are nothing technical or hard, and they tend to stay with very simple riffs and music...this CD tends to be more \\"The Amy Lee Show\\" than it does Evanescence. But a big problem I have with Evanescence is that Amy really cant cut it live. On the CD she sounds great, but the sounds very bad in concert. Cristina from Lacuna Coil and Tarja from Nightwish are both MUCH better singers than her, and they have good bands behind them. But overall, if you listen to Lacuna Coil or Nightwish, you wont get any satisfaction out of this, but if youre into mainstream rock this is something Im sure youll like.
B00005JLYW|1.0|If this was any other movie, it'd win Worst Picture of the Year hands down.  But it's Charlie's Angels.  Therefore, we're supposed to ignore everything bad about it and have fun.  The only fun I had was watching Crispin Glover, and they probably purposely made his spot small, so as not to take away from the \\"fun\\" of the rest of the movie.  Seems like every scene is a music video, with enough ridiculous wire moves and slow motion to fill up 4 or 5 other movies.  Four people will enjoy this movie: <br /> <br />1.) Teenage girls <br />2.) Teenage boys <br />3.) Men without girlfriends <br />4.) Women high on the \\"girl power\\" trip <br /> <br />If you're not on that list, don't bother.
B000002I25|5.0|2009 update<br />Spectacular - I wish the 9/9/09 Beatles remaster were this well recorded.<br /><br />Elektra has re-released all the Doors CDs. They uploaded the master tapes to 24 bit/96khz (nearly SACD quality) and then remapped it back to regular CD format (16bit/44khz). The result is much more dynamic and accurate. If your copy doesn't say 24bit, throw it out and get the new ones. The biggest sonic improvement since the creation of the CD!<br /><br />I have this odd sensation listening to the latest version that to sound is coming though a drum of oil (or an oil-filled output capacitor).<br /><br />There are also some new words missing from previous releases<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />The most perfectly realized debut album in Rock history.<br /> I remember it as if it were yesterday. I saw him at Merriweather Post, we thought he was great, but few others did. We thought this one and Strange Days were the best albums ever done.  Surprisingly enough, The Doors were NOT popular in their time. They had a few hits, Light my Fire, but they did not really achieve the status of Rock Gods until a decade or more after Morrison's death. Most kids thought they were too dark. Too negative.<br /><br />\\"What could we but perceived if the Doors of Perception were cleansed?\\" In the sixties a Rock song writer was not afraid to be literate. He had read Aldous Huxleys book on lysergic acid. He had also read William Blake's description of children in London at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution  \\"Some are born to sweet delight, and some are born to the endless night\\". He listened to Kurt Weill/Bertold Brecht \\"Alabama Song\\" which, among other songs, got them kicked out of Nazi/Weimar Germany for being writing \\"degenerate\\" music in the 1930's. Jim Morrison, a product of Alexandria (Virginia's) George Washington High School, was nothing if not literate.  (He wrote the lyrics for \\"Horse Latitudes\\", about the Spanish conquestadors ship captains tossing out horses to lighten the load when becalmed, as a junior in that High school, or so the story goes. His teacher was not impressed.)<br /><br />Yeah it's dark. It's visionary, like Baudelaire, I guess that's why the French like him so much they allowed him to be buried in Pere-Lechaise in Paris not that far from Oscar Wilde.<br /><br />Morrison was a poet, a visionary, a showman. He drank. He had many bad habits, but satanism was not one of them, he would be quite amused to hear that one! He loved the blues and has probably the best version of Willie Dixon's Back Door Man ever done, certainly the most sinister. But that was Morrison, he loved theater, he did things for effect.<br /><br />I think the Crystal Ship was probably closest to his heart. \\"The Crystal Ship is being filled, a thousand girls and thousand thrills, a million ways to spend your time...\\" Music full of nineteenth century, Romantic, Wagnerian Love-Death. Jim just wanted to float away on that Crystal Ship.<br /><br />I program out his theatrical over-the-top, acting-out, version of Oedipus Rex at \\"The End\\". You have some of the finest Rock music of all time.  Listening to \\"The End\\" on a quality hifi will reveal there is a loud inarticulate scream, but later, in the newest release, there is some, umm, bad language bordering on the incestuous.ed, as a junior in that High school, or so the story goes.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Ok for all the people who keep insisting that the pre-quil trilogies are as good or better than the originals-wake up.  Just because a movie has a Star Wars logo on it does not make it any good.  Pairing awful acting and obvious and pathetic digital effects have made the pre-quil trilogy sad and insulting at best.  If anyone out there likes Star Wars, and wants to watch a great movie, episodes 4-6 are it.  This is a great set, some of the greatest films ever concieved.  But, as I said, Mr. Lucas has lost his mind.  He keeps \\"improving\\" the originals-making them worse.  Ep. 4-6 looked real, maybe a little sketchy but nonetheless real.  Adding shotty digital effects all over the place greatly cheapens these films, and since we will never see the classic original cut movies on DVD, I suggest everyone buys this right away, before old George Lucas does anymore damage.  BUY THE CLASSIC TRILOGY!!!!!THE PRE-QUIL TRILOGY SHOULD NOT EXIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMAH|2.0|When I heard the mixed reviews from my friends about \\"Azkaban,\\" I thought it prudent to wait until it came out on video, rather than spend theater-level bling on it. Truth be known, I'm very glad I didn't. I found myself sharing the sentiments of Comic Book Guy on \\"The Simpsons\\": \\"Worst movie ever\\"--well, in this series at least. Now, I'm not all negative: Buckbeak and the dementors were quite well done, and Dawn French makes an excellent Fat Lady. But the storyline, character development, and even the geography of this movie seem muddled, hurried, and downright inconsistent. When was Hagrid's Hut ever down a ruddy great hill? Where's the smooth slope in the first movies? And where does this bridge come from? And this pendulum in the front door? And why are kids wearing Muggle clothes to all-wizarding Hogsmeade? The first movies thrive on a close rendering of Rowling's text. We WANT to see the books come to life, and we had up until now. I believe that part of what makes the LOTR movies so powerful is their sense of cohesiveness, brought about, at least in part, by one director and one vision. Too many cooks spoil the stew and all that. <br /> <br />     Lost is the sense of continuity and close reading of the text found in \\"Stone\\" and \\"Chamber.\\" I found the movie highly compressed in terms of plot, with many events happening on top of each other, or not at all in the book. Important characters like Lupin and Pettigrew get only a broad stroke, hinting at who they are. The Marauder's Map is integral to the story, yet gets treated like a mere plot device in the movie. Many scenes got Reader's Digested: for instance, the scene in the Three Broomsticks where Harry is learning about Sirius from the conversation among McGonagall, Fudge, Flitwick and Hagrid. This scene offered the opportunity for some first-class acting from folks we just don't get to see enough of in the other movies, and it's given a quick brushover--what a shame. Overall, the movie felt rushed andembryonic in comparison with the others. And now I see we have yet ANOTHER director for \\"Goblet.\\" Please, just give Chris Columbus whatever he wants, and let's get back into the winning groove of the first two. <br />

To my mind this is the best entry of the Trilogy of Kieslowski : Blue , White and Red based on the colors of French flag .<br /><br />Besides this masterpiece film is included in my list of the ten top films of the nineties.
B00005JMAH|1.0|This is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen in my life and i have seen a lot of movies. The order is totally out of whack and the child actors have no idea what they are doing the only reason you could  possibly have of seeing this movie is Alan Rickman.

It's a hilarious spin on Western religious stories -- pointing out their foibles but revering them at the same time.  I attended 12 years of Catholic school and I found this book a lot of fun.  Probably not for devout types who take everything about religion seriously.
B000002JKA|3.0|Musicianship is fantastic, riffs and vocals are trapped in the past & sound tired.
0345457684|4.0|A great book that combines a future of replaceable bodies (\\"sleeves\\") and advanced biotech with a dark `30s style detective novel. The main character is of course a down and out loser with a shady past but superior survival skills. You root for this guy even thought he can't really seem to get it together to really care what happens to himself. The issue of creating tension in a world of personality backups and replaceable clone bodies is handled well. The secondary characters seem incomplete and shadowy but somehow this doesn't detract from the story maybe due to the laid back narrative. Other books by this author would definitely be worth checking out.
B00008EYA5|4.0|While not an Oscar-worthy film, this one is just plain fun to watch.  The action is good and for once the stunts are believable and not absurdly over-the-top.  The dialogue was solid with wit and humor to it.  There are some good lines and funny situation-based dialogue.  The acting is solid.  Nothing seemed to be forced and the actors worked well together and complimented each other's performances.   <br /> <br />The plot was solid, but there were a few \\"I knew that was going to happen\\" moments.  Almost like a quarterback telegraphing his pass.  They don't, in any way, detract from the fun of the movie.  This movie is worth seeing, not necessarily a must see, but definitely worth the cost of a video rental.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I am a big fan of comedy movies and cheap horror movies so when i was about to watch this i didnt think id like it to much.  After the movie started I just got sucked in, this movie is amazing.  It always keeps you sucked in and wondering whats going on.  Even though it did confuse me a lot i kept up with most of it.  Jim Carrey is a great actor for this to, he might be a little strange in other movies but he pulls off this roll very nicely.  This was one of the best movies ive seen in a long time and if you are looking for a great movie to let you think and to just suck you in this is great.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I've never been a big Evanescence fan, I've seen (And enjoyed) their videos and songs I've heard on the radio, but never felt the need to go out and buy their album. <br /> <br />Seeing this sitting there was too good of a deal to pass up. <br /> <br />The DVD is divided into 3 seperate sections, CONCERT, MUSIC VIDEOS, and BEHIND THE SCENES. <br /> <br />Each section of the DVD has a real elaborate DVD Menu interweaving them all together, and it does a good job, I just wish there were a way to skip them since some are quite lengthy after seeing them a few times, but not a big drawback at all. <br /> <br />Onto the sections, Clicking the CONCERT Button brings you to a menu with options to play the entire concert, or select a song from the menu (The tracklisting for the concert is: Haunted, Going Under, Taking over me, Everybody's fool, Thoughtless (korn cover), My last breath, Farther away, Breathe no more, My immortal, Bring me to life, Tourniquet, Imaginary, and Whisper). <br />The concert was filmed in Paris fairly recent I'm assuming. It's a great quality show, and it looks great on the DVD -- the lights really make a great impact. Often Music Video DVD's get a lousy treatment, this one really shines though. <br /> <br />Watching the concert, I really enjoyed every song on it (And the Korn cover was a real nice addition), it's been a long time since I've watched a concert DVD or bought a CD and liked every song (Often I end up skipping several to get to the select few I liked). <br /> <br />The  concert runs for roughly an hour and is in Dolby 5.1 sound (Sounds great) or Stereo. <br /> <br />Onto the Music Video side, you get 4 video's (My Immortal (A black-and-white shot, slower-paced video that looks sort of like a commercial for Diamond's), Everybody's fool (A parody video showing the lead singer living life as a lie showing her in various positions selling products (Pizza's, a model, soda's, and all of the pain the lies bring, My favorite video on the DVD), Bring me to life (A real interesting video with the band performing in a high-up city with the camera's zipping around through various rooms, my 2nd favorite video on the DVD), and Going under (Which has a very dark gothic/horror feel throughout the video)). Again, like the Concert section, the video's also have a \\"Play All\\" option as well as being in Dolby 5.1 or Stereo sound. The 4 videos' run for probably 25 minutes total. <br /> <br />Finally, the Behind the Stage feature is presented as a whole-video, but also broken into sections you can jump directly to. Life on the Road shows the band going through their everyday lives, playing around backstage, and just having fun. Showtime shows setups for the stage during their shows, preperation for the concerts (Sound checks, meetings, etc.), as well as additional video footage of them performing across the country. Bloopers (As you might guess) is a collection of bloopers, mess-ups, and practical jokes on eachother, caught on tape. Finally, Evanescence Unleashed is similar to the first feature, just showing the band having fun with eachother. The behind the scenes section runs for an hour, and is only in Stereo. <br /> <br />The package also includes an Audio CD. The Audio CD is the entire \\"Concert\\" section of the DVD in Audio form which is really nice as well, to take on the go or just listen to without needing to put the DVD In (I wish more bands would do this). <br /> <br />Overall, its a great set and is available in 2 seperate packages (One comes in a CD Jewel case with the 2 disc's inside, the other in a DVD Case with the 2 disc's inside) depending on how you prefer your collection. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this to any Evanescence fan, big or small. I immediately became a much bigger fan after seeing this.

Climb every mountain, ford every stream...<br /><br />And at the same time, the treasure you seek most may be easier to find than you could ever imagine.<br /><br />I fully expected one last cliche - that the treasure would be all the knowledge and experience and love that the boy experienced through his journey. His own life and heart would be his treasure. In this, I was (happily) wrong.<br /><br />But I loved this little book. It was told in such a lyrical way, and it made the unbelievable completely plausible. Magic, mysticism, beauty, love: all in this little book, all portrayed so prettily.<br /><br />I recommend this book because it's a quick, fun read that leaves you feeling better for having read it.

He gets a ride to London on the night bus, which provides transport for stranded wizards and witches (the journey on the bus is one of the highlights of the movie, and definitey the funniest part).  In London, he learns to his relief that the unfortunate illicit magic episode has been hushed up, and he can return to Hogwarts after all. <br /> <br />There's more troulbe in store though.  Sirius Black, the wizard who apparently betrayed Harry's parents to Lord Voldemort, has escaped from the dreaded prison of Azkaban, and the terrifiying Dementors, the guardians of the prison, are at Hogwarts looking for him.  Harry's beloved broomstick gets smashed up in a Quidditch match, and Hermione has a new familiar, a cat who, Ron is convinced, wants to have his pet rat Scabbers for lunch. <br /> <br />The third book in the series is my favourite, and on the whole a very good job has been done of transfering it to the screen.  It is deeper and darker in tone than the two earlier Harry adventures, and some of the charm of the original is invariably lost in the changeover from book to movie.  There are some spectacular special effects, notably the wonderful scene where Harry goes for a ride on the Hippogriff (who wouldn't like to do that?)  And the climax of the movie, where Hermione and Harry discover the truth about Sirius Black and have to go back in time to change the present,is absolutely gripping. <br /> <br />The film doesn't entirely capture the charm  of the book, but it comes very close.
0553801546|5.0|This book ended the tawny man and assassins series with a lot of class. Somehow the author managed to resolve Fitzchivalry's unfinished business without sacrificing the work she had put into characterisation. The relationship between the fool and fitz is beautifully crafted. Depending on each individual's reading of Fitz, this book may be seen by some as to conclude with a happy fairytale ending, by others as a tearjerking tragedy - or both. I think that the cleverness of this ending lies in this very ambiguity - I was dissatisfied with the ending of the Assassins series because I found it to be so much of the one type of ending that I found it unbelievable. Often I have found that when people say that an ending is realistic - they really mean disappointing - this is not the case in this book. I think that the six books invite us to share the joys and sorrows of the main character and at the conclusion of this book, in contrast to the end of the assassins series, we have to separate ourselves from Fitzchivalry and let him make the choice. The frustration I feel at being torn between being both incredibly happy and terribly sad for him is what makes the ending so powerful.
B0006399FS|5.0|First, please listen to this album plenty of times and let them grown on you.  I'm a u2 fan and I didn't even enjoy the album the first time through.  Probably because there were so many high expectations, they are the biggest band in the world and it's been four years since we got new music.  Second, turn it up loud on a great sound system. <br /> <br />I'm going on a limb here with u2 fans, but this is their finest work as a whole ever.  It is better than \\"Joshua Tree\\" and up their with \\"Achtung Baby.\\"  On those records the great songs might be better than on HTDAAB, but as a whole this record for me is near perfection.  Every song just exhales passion and Edge is going crazy on this album. <br /> <br />The worse song for me is \\"Vertigo,\\" its good but they took the original song \\"Native Son,\\" which was a political song with the same guitars and everything and changed it over to some pop, mainstream lyrics to have a hit on radio.  The original \\"Native Son\\" was loud and political and sounded like the Sex Pistols or something.  Awesome. <br /> <br />U2 are the greatest, just make sure you don't leave us boys!! Rating: 9.5 out of 10
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Troy was awesome. Period. I might be this crazy about it just because im a big fan of Greek and Roman myths, but my friends who saw it with me don't know anything about that and they loved it. I used to diss Brad Pitt till i saw Fight Club and this, and saw how awesome his acting is. He's the perfect guy to play Achilles. In short, the acting was awesome, the fight scenes were breathtaking, and the action was nonstop. See it today, you wont be disappointed. If you cant find it playing somewhere you'll have to wait for the DVD to come out in January.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|Although the acting was superb, I despised the plot.  I found the symbolism frustrating, and the ending disappointing.  Perhaps I am misreading it, but my take on it was that the movie attempted to have the \\"Mystic River\\" wash away the sins of the past... but what was the sin?  And how could the river be read as washing it away?<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />A young boy is abducted and brutally molested, and he and his two best friends suffer for this act (though the abduction was no fault of their own).  When they grow up, become men, get married, and have families, the daughter of one of the men is brutally murdered.  In attempting to find answers to this murder, the past is constantly manifesting itself in these boys'/men's present lives, and the same man who was molested is incorrectly fingered as the murderer.  This man is then murdered (in revenge) and dumped in the Mystic River.  The two surviving men later learn that he was innocent, but have no remorse... instead they find themselves somehow relieved.<br /><br />It seems as though the murder represents the physical burying of a past that haunted the two survivors.  A past that, although disturbing, was not their fault.  The most upsetting aspect of all this was that they buried the greatest sufferer, the VICTIM!  And come away from the whole mess feeling confident, content, and back on the right track.  It is as though they can now escape from the dream they were floudering in and really live.<br /><br />What the?<br /><br />With this ending, all empathy for these characters goes out the window.  Where is the guilt?  Where is the remorse?  How can this be an end and not a continutation of the tragedy?<br /><br />I think you can sense my frustration.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Those are the words spoken by Dr. Samuel Loomis a.k.a Donald Pleasance to describe one the most memorable horror villians to hit the big screen. The movie first opens with a young Michael Myers killing his sister ( Judith Myers ) with a larger butcher knife ( a weapon which Michael would be known for using to kill his victims with,later in the movie ) in 1963. Fast-forward to 15 years later, Michael escapes and the terror on Haddonfield, Illnois starts again. We then meet a young women named Laurie Strode ( who in every horror movie is the typical \\" good girl \\" ), who goes to the local high school with her friend, Linda and Annie. As each girl, is thinking  of how they are spending their Halloween night. Dr. Loomis trys to race against time to find his mental paitent, Michael Myers. As night comes, each character awaits their fate......<br /><br />Halloween is a great movie, and surprisingly ( in a horror movie ) there is hardly any blood. The movie stars Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, P.J. Soles as Linda, Nancy Loomis as Annie, and Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis ( the doctor who is convinced that Michael is pure evil). The acting in this movie, is wonderful for a slasher ( which is sometimes rare ), the directoring by John Carpentar ( one of my favorite directors ) is good and makes scenes very creepy esspeically with the POVs shoots. Ahh....and let's not the forget the unforgettable score for this movie, the music for this movie alone is scary enough. I personally think what makes this horror movie different from others, is that it is realstic, and seems like the type of thing that could happen in your neighborhood. Now to the DVD, the  picture and sound is clear ( compared to the VHS verison I had ) the extras are great. But there are also the deleted scenes, which weren't included the theather release. Do I recommend this film? Yes!!!!! This is a must have in every horror fan's movie collection.
B000075BFK|5.0|What can I say? This album just adds more to the hype of Tupac's life.  This album is phenomenal.....Execellent beyond belief with the remixes, and the current artists featured on this album like Mya, Anthony Hamilton, Tyrese just to name a few....Tupac is forever in my heart.  God Rest in peace...
B0006399FS|1.0|If you are honest with yourself, don't pretend to be nice with U2 by saying beautiful words for this soup while you actually knows it sucks
B0002YLC24|4.0|How do you top the most amazing, wonderful, romantic, spontaneous night of your life?  How does anything else after that even compare to that once-in-a-lifetime experience of meeting the one random stranger you connect with instantaneously?  And how do you go on when your ideal of a soulmate turns out to be an illusion that leaves you stranded alone in Vienna?  Does love become an illusion thereafter? <br /> <br />I watched Before Sunrise when I was 13 years old and still believed hopelessly in happily ever after.  I was disappointed that there wasn't the final happily ever after for Jessie and Celine but convinced myself that they would ultimately meet again and live as they should.  Well, a lot's changed for both me and the characters in the movie in the past 9 years.  This is the first movie that I felt grew with me...grew more experienced, more cynical, more disappointed, etc.  And I have to say, I loved it even more than the original.  This movie, much like the original, is devoid of anything spectacular.  There are no special effects, no gags guaranteed to make the audience laugh.  It's literally just the two actors who despite life's disappointments find themselves together again for the second and possibly last time.  I use the word \\"actors\\" because there is such a rawness to the dialogue that it's easy to juxtapose Ethan Hawke for Jessie and Julie Delpy for Celine.  The disappointment each character talks about is as familiar to me now as the hopeless romance of Before Sunrise was to the 13 year old who watched it 9 years ago.  And yet, despite being older and more realistic, the characters and you, as the viewer, end up wondering \\"what if.\\"  What if Jessie and Celine are really meant to be?  What if fate really does exist? <br /> <br />Before Sunrise is the coming of age for both you, the viewer, and for Ethan Hawke.  This is not to slight Julie Delpy, but having grown up with Ethan Hawke in Dead Poets Society and Reality Bites - a truly seminal movie in my teens, you finally really get to see who he's become as an adult.  It was gratifying to see all the flaws and the wrinkles that accompany this accomplished, intelligent person. <br /> <br />Before Sunrise makes your realize that even though you may be older, more wizened, more pessimistic about love and life - and rightfully so - when that one person comes back into your life, there is nothing you won't do to be able to spend just one more minute, one more song with that person.  So hey, perhaps we are still that hopeless romantic we were at 13...it's just been dormant for awhile.  Watch Before Sunrise and perhaps reawaken yourself to possibilities long since forgotten.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Wow, was all I could say when I first saw the beautiful animations done by Square pictures (final fantasy the spirits within) in the opening short final flight of the osiris. It was an excellent short that really set the stage for the enter the matrix videogame and the two sequels, and I would buy this DVD simply for that film alone but there's still so much more. The rest of the films are excellent tie in's that answer alot of questions and are truly enhanced by the commentary. Speaking of bonus content there is a great feature on the history of anime that is extremly enjoyable to any anime fan out there. With excellent music, great extras, and some wonderful animated films the animatrix  deserves all 5 stars
B00005JMAH|4.0|It has been quite some time since I had read this HP book and I have read all the HP books, and I had not seen the movie before watching the DVD. I thought as a stand alone movie it was excellent. However as the series of books moves along the movies are forced to abbreviate the increasingly complex plots. I would advise all HP movie buffs to also read the books. The stories, films and characters are all maturing and I hope the pattern is able to continue at such a high level. The cinematography in this DVD is out of this world. I missed Richard Harris as Dumbledore though.
B00008PX8P|5.0|WOW! I've never seen a more powerful collection of rock music on DVD. Various Led Zeppelin concerts from 1970, 1973, 1975 and 1979 are featured on two DVDs and all of the performances are excellent! Visual sources vary from 35mm film (1973, excellent left over footage of The song remains the same movie, incl. a fantastic version of The Ocean), 16mm film (1970, an almost complete concert from London's Royal Albert Hall, a bit dark maybe, but still excellent quality for an over 30 years old film) and video tapes (two inch video tapes I guess, filmed for the giant video screens at 1975's Earls Court and 1979's Knebworth performances). All of the concert footage is highly enjoyable, there are many great extras and the surround sound is simply spectacular! Almost all the famous Zep songs are included here. A must for everyone who likes (hard)rock music.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|megadeth always were a step behind metallica in creativity and song writing but symphony of destruction cameout and simply crushed the lame black album by metallica for once dave mustaine was writing decent lyrics and marty friedman was just playing killer guitar i get tired of hearing about zak wylde you wanna hear some great metal leads check out this cd symphony of destruction psychotron countdown to extinction etc this song has a bunch of heavy creative well made songs and is 1 of the best metal albums alltime if you think justice for all was metallicas peak well this was megadeths peak
B00000K19E|5.0|Perhaps one of the most culture-influencing films of the last thirty years, The Matrix combines amazing acting with a wonderful story and brilliant special effects.  You'll find it parodied in everything from Shrek to your average Saturday morning cartoon, and people gobble up other movies the actors have been in.  It has lost some repute because of the poor quality of its sequels, but this is still oe of the best films you will ever see.  This is a definite must-have for ANY film-watcher's collection, sci-fi fan or no.
B0006399FS|4.0|I think this is a good not great album. I think the band actually sounds very tight and very in synch. I just think that Bono sounds like he's run out of things to say.     I can't believe how many lines throughout the lyrics are directly lifted from previous songs. Those who are know the previous material well will know what I am talking about. \\"I gave you everything you wanted, it wasn't what you wanted\\" and \\"Love catches you by the heel\\" are two examples. I guess I cringe everytime I hear these - partly because I too grew up with these guys and have incredibly tough expectations for any album. I'll take Pop over this as at least Pop was pushing some type of envelope.     Bono is no doubt stretched thin with his many many committments. I never thought I'd say this but if he's not as insipred as he was I hope they stop so we can remember them as they were. God forbid they go the way of Pearl Jam. Besides, his fight for Debt Relief is certainly a very noble and worthy cause.     \\"All that youc can't leave behind\\" was a collection of singles. This is more of a throwback to Achtung Baby or Joshua Tree in that there is a definite theme throughout the album. Don't get hung up on the whole Vertigo single \\"sound\\" and be disappointed. It's just that, unlike the aforementioned, with each track you are hoping for the two or three \\"greats\\" that will take the whole CD to the next level. They're not there. Imagine Achtung Baby without \\"One\\" or \\"Mysterious Ways\\" or \\"Acrobat\\" and you have this CD.     As I say, musically this is really good and has bits and pieces from every era on it including an almost \\"I Will Follow\\" type riff on one song through to ATYCLB \\"A Man and a Woman\\" Bono just seems to be missing the right level of indignation/energy on a personal or political level right now to light this one up. Try and find something as clever or angry as \\"Please\\" from Pop (even Zooropa had some tremendous lyrics in it's title track and \\"So close, faraway\\") and you won't.
0596007124|5.0|This is just an amazing book! Hats off to O'Reilly and Freemans for putting together this book. Book explains the concepts with incredible ease and simplicity, better yet, its such an interesting one that you just dont feel like stopping.    I've been exploring books on Patterns for a while and there are really good ones with 5 Stars etc but they take more traditional approach and things can get boring.     Over all, this just the book you need if you wanna get started with Design Patterns and build a solid foundation.
0688101364|5.0|I have used this book for years.  The directions are expicit and easy to follow.  The tips are very helpful.  The layout of each recipe is excellent.  I have made many of the recipes.  If you are looking for a book with sophisticated cookies, this and Flo Braker's Sweet Minatures are great choices.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This is such a wonderful movie.  This was the very first movie I saw in a theater as kid at age 9 and was allow to escort my younger cousin.  It was our first time alone in the theater and we felt so grown up.<br /><br />This movie was so full of surprises and has always been my second most favorite movie (after the Wizard of Oz.)  Julie Andrews was the most perfect nanny ever.  I've always wonder why our babysitters never carried a magic bag.  I remember going home and trying to snap my fingers to clean up my room.  My shock that my toys and clothes didn't move on their own.  The music was wonderful and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious was the biggest song hit in school (sung is just about every school's concert in our town.)<br /><br />This movie was full of magic.  It allow us to dream that things were possible.  Even when the grownups didn't understand, you knew that there was magic all around.  I am so thrill for the 40th anniversary and will get this.  I am still bum that you can't clean your house with a simple snap of your fingers.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|this collection of songs is bigger than are u experienced and contains hendrixs remake of all along the watchtower so this is the one to buy today hendrixs music is just as important as it was 35 years ago this collection has all his biggest hits along the watch tower fire the wind crys mary hey joe purple haze foxy lady it even has his  version of the star spangled banner that he played at woodstock there will never be another jimi hendrix and this cd is the best collection of his timeless music all so called guitarist regardless of style owe this man a debt for changing the way people view guitar and rock n roll
0394800184|5.0|I read this to my children when they were quite small. My daughter adopted this book as HER book when she was just over one.  My husband and I would often read this at family gatherings to our children and whatever nieces and nephews would join in (all ages)and we usually acquired quite a crowd as the various children were attracted to the zany voices that this book inspires.    Now my children are grown and I work as a speech and language pathologist in a public school.  This usually is the first \\"story\\" book I read to the younger set.  Once they are hooked on board books and lift the flap books and have acquired a small amount of ability to sit still for a book, I introduce this book.  It is soooo good for vocabulary and sentence skills and so much fun to read aloud to the kids.  I incorporate lots of nutty voices and motor movement to act out the plot and I never hear a word of complaint when I pick this book out for another reading.      Usually I leave out several books for the kids to chose from and invariably this one is chosen first, no matter how many times I have read it to them!    P.S.  I now own this as a board book so I could hear my husband read this to our daughter's small son.  He defined himself as a book reader to her and her brother and now he is reading it to our grandson, who was one when we introduced it.  It one of the first with a distinct plot (albeit, very simple plot) and he always listens all the way through.  Time will tell if he will like it as much as his mother did.
B00005JMAH|2.0|I love the books. I loved the first two movies. I didn't care for this movie at all! Maybe it's partly because the 3rd book is my favorite that I was so disappointed in the movie. <br /> <br />While I realize the book is much longer and that they obviously couldn't include everything, I think they included several things that seemed to be \\"fillers\\" and not necessary to the plot while they left out some very vital things that should have been included. <br /> <br />I found the characters this time to be mostly annoying, even Harry. Ron wasn't too bad. But Hermione's know-it-all attitude was even worse than usual and got on my nerves badly. They portrayed Draco as whiny and cowardly - not in his character. I don't like the new Dumbledore at all - what's with the grotesque fingernails and the scene where he was hitting Ron's injured leg in the hospital ward?  <br /> <br />I saw this movie at the movie theatre once - wasn't impressed. Was anxious to get the DVD thinking maybe I totally missed something - and it was even worse. I have 4 kids ages 5-9 and not one of them was overly impressed with this movie although they loved the others. <br /> <br />The extras included were even more disappointing. The 5 deleted scenes were a big let down (that's usually one of my favorite extras on any DVD). No bloopers - another of my favorites on most DVDs. The interviews might have been okay if it wasn't for the presence and ludicrous comments of that extremely annoying shrunken head things - it was painful to watch. <br /> <br />I hope the next movies are improvements over this one. My DVD copy is going into my entertainment center where it will probably sit unwatched for eternity.
B0000039QA|5.0|How can anyone give this album less than 5 stars? Unless they a Tupac fan. Well i say stop all this beef and make peace.

0064407667|3.0|When I saw that Jim Carrey had bought the rights and was creating something wonderful with these books -- I had high hopes for reading enjoyment.    The book was good -- but unlike \\"Harry Potter\\" for me it has no real crossover appeal to adults.  These books are written strictly for elementary age children.    I am a reading teacher and I felt the author's constant need to introduce terms and then promptly define them for the reader was distracting, HOWEVER, I would say that exact same quality makes this series an excellent candidate for a classroom \\"read-a-loud\\" -- especially for a group of reluctant/struggling readers.    Young children on younger reading levels might very well get a hoot out of this -- but this is never going to bring in their parents or older siblings like Roald Dahl or JK Rowling can with their fantasy.    So, if you're 8 -- you may love this book.  If you are 12 -- you won't be able to get rid of it fast enough.    If I could give two sets of stars, I'd give 5 stars for children and 3 for adults.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album, while great in itself perhaps falls victim to unrealistic expectations. By that I mean I think all the hype and everything surrounding this release is more indicative of the desire to go back a bit in time....to when U2 could be counted on to  capture the moment, as it were, in a pop-politic manner of speaking. We missed U2...The real U2 when they simply rocked...well here they are! Back again! This album is awesome. It will not change the world, but then it doesn't aspire to.

6302891272|4.0|I am a student at Nagoya International School in Japan, and got an oppurtunity to write a film review for director Kurosawa Akira's \\"Throne of Blood.\\" Here it is: <br /> <br />\\"Throne of Blood,\\" an adaptation of Shakespeare's \\"Macbeth\\" was done by Japan's most famous film director, Kurosawa Akira. He successfully took a play that took place in medieval Scotland and put it on screen with a setting of feudal Japan. Though the adaptations and plot were fairly similar to that of the actual play, Throne of Blood had its differences. <br />The basic characterization of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth by Kurosawa were the same, but I would say that they both had some exaggerations from the original. Kurosawa's Macbeth, Washizu, was more moody and had his feelings all out. He was also more animated, which I thought was represented most in the facial expressions of Macbeth in the last scene where he was being shot at by hundreds of soldiers. Kurosawa's Lady Macbeth, Asaji, was much more evil. Her very cold personality and emotionless ness made her much scarier than Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth. She is so emotionless and evil that it felt a little awkward when she went insane in the end. In Shakespeare's play, Lady Macbeth's true feelings inside herself, of feelings different from what she showed to others like Macbeth were being expressed through a soliloquy, so her going insane was reasonable, but it seemed that the emotionless character of Asaji had no reason to go mad. Though the characterizations did not perfectly follow the play, Kurosawa's characters definitely contributed to the attractiveness of the film. <br /> I felt that the major plot change that Kurosawa made in his film was the fact that the Duncan character took throne by killing the previous Lord. The fact that Duncan killed the previous Lord to gain seat as Lord, and that Macbeth killed Duncan to gain his seat as Lord, makes us think of the cycle of Lord being killed by the next Lord. This represents how power is gained through killing. I felt that this slight alternation in plot creates a great difference in theme. Where Shakespeare portrays the flaws of individuals like Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, Kurosawa portrays the flaw of a society, or the corrupt human nature itself. <br /> Overall, I was amazed at how well Kurosawa adapted this play to Japanese society. Even though Kurosawa faithfully followed the story by Shakespeare, there is no trace of anything that makes us feel that it came from the West, and was actually a stage play. I have actually never watched any of Kurosawa's other films but just by watching this film, I thought I was slightly able to feel the reason to why he is praised as the best Japanese film director ever. <br />
B00003CXIP|4.0|This movie is very interesting for me. Because four young boys showed their friendship and morality with undergoing all sorts of hardship. Second reason, everyone's character is funny especially Teddy like a psycho. And each character made harmony altogether in this story. First of all, each boy's character is good, nice, and innocent. They were very young but they kept friendship and morality. Besides they helped each other for their friends. I want to emphasize that is better point than normal adult.
B0006399FS|1.0|I do not support to see a passive U2, inactive, sold, commercial, cynical, lazy, fop, unimaginative, turneb back, paid, putrid, dead, flat, false, missed, liar, quiet, beyatrer, content, etc, etc, etc. <br />This is by far the worst U2 era, being nothing but decade of decadence. <br />Please Bono learn how to sing with your damaged and drunk voice, thanks
B000001ESF|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. If you are going by what Slick dick says, look at his review. Comparing Rush to Slayer, Megadeth, and Metallica? He must not know that Rush put out their first CD in 1969 when the guys from those bands were nothing more than dreamers. And calling Rush \\"new wave\\"... wow. I'm speechless. Ask any music entusiast who has listened to Rush and I can almost guarantee that they will say this stands as their best album. It is a great buy and every minute of the rock they sing is priceless.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|This is a movie that I originally purchased merely because Audrey Tautou is in it. However she has essentially a cameo. But I loved this movie despite the \\"Tautou shortage\\". It's great! I was left hoping for a sequel...seriously.
B0002MB7QW|3.0|- but I ran into problems trying to care about any of the characters.<br /><br />One very good point is that \\"global warming\\" doesn't necessarily mean that everything gets warmer everywhere. It does mean that the world's weather is a mchine driven by heat, and that warming is like nitro in the gas tank. Hots get hotter, colds get colder, everything becomes more of whatever it was, and not necessarily where you'd expect. Another good point is that indirect effects, like shifts in ocean currents, may exert surprisingly strong control over the climate.<br /><br />For dramatic purposes, all those effects were compressed from decades to days or even minutes. Rising ocean levels were crammed into a single wave that flooded New York to waist depth on the Statue of Liberty. Nice effects, but I just don't think many buildings would be left standing if hit by a wall of water ten storeys high. Maybe, opposite of the intuitive result, global warming could trigger a new ice age. That would certainly be dramatic, but I suspect that it would take more than the hour or two shown here.<br /><br />Set your expectations properly: it's just a disaster movie, about as plausible as those asteroid movies a couple of years ago. If you've already dedicated yourself to a useless evening, you may as well watch this.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00005JMAH|5.0|What a delight \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" was to me! I liked the first two movies in the series. I loved this one. Partly, this is because I am an adult, and this darker, but not necessarily more serious installment, is more compelling. It seems much more in tune with the awesome responsibilities that would come with being a wizard - if, of course, there really was such a thing! Also, I think children are much more attuned to their primordial beginnings than are adults. As we mature and become increasingly material and obsessed with security, we are perhaps more likely to be scared by `things that go bump' in the night than are children. I remember as a child being both more scared by, but ultimately more in tune with, Disney's \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" than I was by \\"The Lady and the Tramp\\".  <br /> <br />In this installment, Harry [Daniel Radcliffe] and his best friends, Hermoine and Ron [Emma Watson and Rupert Grint] arrive for their third year at Hogwarts School to find more turmoil than ever. An allegedly evil wizard named Sirius Black [Gary Oldman] has escaped from Azkaban Prison and is making his way to the school, which is essentially in `lock down' and being guarded by hideously threatening demons. It appears that Black is making his way to the school in order to kill Harry, heir to a very powerful family of sorcerers.  <br /> <br />Here, Harry and his friends have entered adolescence. They are more awkward than they were in the first two films. They are also more endearing. [If you watch trailers for the original movie, you will be amazed to see how much these actors have grown.] Childhood lays in tatters behind them, adulthood looms before them as a major challenge.  <br /> <br />Alas, the remarkable Richard Harris died before this episode was filmed. He is ably replaced by the great Ian McKellan as Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts. As one might expect, Gary Oldham amazes as Sirius Black. Not for the first time, I didn't knowit was Oldman playing the role until the credits rolled. How does he do it? <br /> <br />Breathing new life into the series is director Alfonso Cuaron, who replaced Chris Columbus. Cuaron directed one of my favorite children's films, \\"\\"The Little Princess\\", as well as one of my favorite ADULT films, \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\". He's a filmmaker to watch. <br /> <br />\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is highly recommended.   <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|Plain and simple.. This album is terrible. Has Bono lost his singing voice? He merely talks through his songs. None of the other songs are hip and alternative like Vertigo; they're of the \\"Fast forward to the next song and hope for something better\\" calibur. None of the lyrics have any meaning or heart. When the whole album is like this, you're better off living in the past of U2's stellar accomplishments.
B00005T30L|5.0|The movie started with Thora Birch dancing to a East Indian music video, and it was wierd and captured my attention simutaneously. It's a good intro to a different kind of teenage dramedy.<br /><br />Thora Birch gives her very best performance in this film that had won her the best actress award at the Seattle Film Festival, but failed to get an Oscar nomination just like her equally amazing co-star Steve Buscemi. Her character is like a rebellious version of Carrie without telekinetic power. She and her best friend(Scarlett Johanson) will do anything but be normal.They like to act and look wierd and original in school, and she loves vintage music that was also in Buscemi's collection.<br /><br />In high school, she's a gifted artist, and her work impressed her funky and essentric teacher(Illeanor Douglas), who was a total comic relief in this movie. She's very supportive to Birch, but her work was too provocative that she was not accepted for the scholarship.<br /><br />After graduation, Birch find it hard to maintain her friendship with Johanson, because their interests and ideals are different. Ultimately, her only friend left was Buscemi, but he was being pressured by his new girlfriend to stop seeing her. So she's feeling like a ghost in her world, and she wants to leave her environment. She eventually headed to the bustop that she previously saw a old man got on an \\"imaginery bus\\" that goes to other worlds. She got on the bus and off she goes away from the ghost world.
0553212621|5.0|DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover remains infamous for the explicit description of sexual encounters between a upper class housewife and a laborer, and eventhough it features among the top lists of the novels written in last centuty, like many others I started reading it with suspicision. What I found was a world with vividly described characters, a frank writing to the degree it talks about all aspects of human emotion, and sexual ones too. Unlike the mainstream writers before him, Lawrence writes a powerful and passionate novel, full of sensuality and natural bursts of energy. So in some respects it is a mature novel, but it if neither porno, nor as sexual by modern standards as it was made out to be in early last century. In fact, by present standards, it does not shock any grown ups, maybe can provide the shock shared by people in 1930s and 1940s to enthusiastic readers in late teenage or early twenties, or for someone whose diet was entirely Victorian before this.<br /><br />So after you get through and over with your own the prejudices and the infamous part, you start to see why Lawrence is one writer from the last century you just should not miss. His description of nature, of forests, of people, emotions, thoughts and actions of both men and women, his references to class struggles, his lyrical style and most importantly the similies swept me off my feet. His words move before your eyes, recreating beautiful imagery, reconstructing (the infamous) Connie, the laborer Mellors or Connie's cripple husband Clifford as completely humanly, falling, fearless or failing, sexually charged or bored or incapable, imaginative, passionate or hateful, lively, lusty or invalid, very lifelike people! The choice of these three characters provides him the ideal meat to create such beautiful poetic, intense prose. So much so, that after finishing this novel you rush off to the store and find yet another Lawrence level. (Picked Rainbow, was equally delighted and amazed:), but that is another story)!<br /><br />I think the most important part of this novel is the sheer brilliance of the style in which it is written. Poetic short sentences, with astute comparisons and frank expression, run from sentence to sentence, and sway you in a strong current of his writing, while you are not only enjoying the ride, but also noticing the beautiful, changing, evolving scenery that you encounter at each instant. This is indeed a rich novel, packed with a natural beauty of human emotions and likes and dislikes, with poetic fervor of the writer that will grip any reader with the beauty of his prose. Unlike most other famous novels, this novel is written in simple English, is short in length, readable at breakneck speed, though so charged and passionate that you have to stop to breathe every few pages, and very open and direct, and yet has exceedingly introspective characters, the progression of their thoughts and feelings are inetgral part of the novel.<br /><br />Read it. Sexuality is no more than found on any adult rating moved these days. Beauty of prose one of the best of the authors of last century. If you have always loved 19th century authors, read most of the romantic classics by Bronte sisters, Austen, Dickens or Thackerey, read this novel and notice why Lawrence shocks and yet the brilliance of his work soon shifts the spotlight to his name into one of the most important novelists of last century.but that is another story)! <br /> <br />I think the most important part of this novel is the sheer brilliance of the style in which it is written.

B0006399FS|1.0|After a rocking opener, this cd hits a speed bump and never recovers. There are only a few bands that I wait with great anticipation for a new cd. Sometimes it's 2 years, other times it can be as much as 6 yrs. I waited 4 long years for a new release from U2, and all I can say is \\"Are the critics, who get paid to review music, being paid off by Bono and comp.??\\" I can't beleve that all of those magazines, some of which I subscribe to, actually liked this mess of a cd as much as they say they do. I forget which magazine I was reading in the supermarket, but they actually ranked this cd #1 on their year end best of list!! Another compared it Joshua Tree, saying that it's just as good, if not better!! Blasphemy! Bono has pretty much tossed the idea of actually singing, and winds up speaking(rather muffled) most of the songs. I just thought that after the awsome guitar riff on \\"Vertigo\\", this was gonna be a killer of an album. The only thing it killed was my respect for every music critic that rated this garbage 4 or 5 stars out of 5. By the way, as a note to Amazon, you really need to make 0 stars an option!
B0006399FS|5.0|You've heard their song \\"Vertigo\\" on the iPod commercials, you've seen the video for said song on MTV and VH1, and you've heard said song numerous times on the radio. Now you can hear it as many times as you want, along with 10 other songs, on U2's latest album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. Can it get any better? No. Why? Because it's the best you can get out of U2, and it is definitely the best they have done so far. <br /> <br />Sure, you may be tired of hearing \\"Vertigo\\" repeatedly day after day, but once you hear the other songs, such as \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", \\"Crumbs On Your Table\\", and \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\", you'll know why you bought the album. Not just for that one overly-played song, no way. But for the enjoyment of hearing one of U2's best albums since 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind. <br /> <br />Bono's songwriting is at its strongest, with The Edge adding to many songs with either piano, additional vocals, or both. Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen rock it like they always do, and even though you hear enough of U2 these days, you will never get enough of this album. <br /> <br />Say what you want about U2. You can say they sold out, you can say they lost their fire, that they're washed up. Go ahead and say it. But this one album is definitely one of the best albums of 2004. And just in time as well.
B00005A46T|1.0|Not only is Slipknot's \\"Iowa\\" an insult to real metal, but it's also an insult to music in general. Like the last album, we get poor musicianship and beyond bad lyrics. Honestly, these are some of the worst lyrics I've ever seen - immature, whiny, and overly pathetic. Even Good Charlotte has better lyrics than this (don't get me wrong, they are terrible as well). The guys from Good Charlotte are pretty young and don't know what they're talking about, so I can forgive them for some of their bad lyrics. Corey Taylor, however, is in his 30's and has a kid, yet he's still whining like a 12-year-old. I used to actually like these guys a few years ago (I even had one of their t-shirts), which was, ironically, when I was 12. <br /> <br />We start the album off with \\"(515)\\", which is nothing but grown men screaming and trying to sound scary, but it only makes me wet my pants with laughter. The next track, \\"People = S***\\" is a poorly written rant on the society around them. Funny, this is the same society that pays these guys millions to write the same kind of lyrics a gothic 13-year-old could write. <br /> <br />Moving on, \\"The Heratic Anthem\\" boasts \\"If you're 555, then I'm 666!\\"...yeah, that's good to know. If you're going to try being satanic, at least make a little sense. \\"Gently\\" is next, and oddly, it's actually decent. At least they try to do something a little different on this song, as it has a little bit of a progressive feel to it. The closer, \\"Iowa\\", is over 14 minutes, and as you guessed, is pure agony. When asked about this track, Corey claims that he \\"performed it naked and bleeding from self-inflicted wounds\\". And we wonder where kids get the idea to slit their wrists? As if his lyrics didn't show how childish the guy is, his actions certainly do. <br /> <br />When it's all said and done, I really can't see why anyone would like this. Tuned down guitars, boring/repetitive riffs, and it isn't even catchy (after all, that's all these kids care about nowadays)like their other albums are. I guess people think these guys are cool since they can use more unoriginal curse words than Linkin Park. Yes, this is heavier than their last album, but screaming gets really annoying when you don't have a decent band to back it up. Hopefully, one day these kids will realize how bad this crap is and be embarassed to admit that they were ever fans (sadly, these kids will probably move on to whatever the next trend is). It's kind of weird how if someone insults Slipknot, that suddenly makes them a 'stuck-up musical elitist' or 'an extreme metal fan that can't appreciate anything', yet the same people that spout that kind of stuff to defend their precious band will freely insult the likes of Nelly. How ironic it is that Slipknot are the Nelly of the metal World - terrible lyrics, an immature vocalist that's in his 30's, and most importantly, both embarass the genre that they try to imitate. <br /> <br />(Small note: I showed this review to a professional reviewer, who replied by calling it the \\"Best review ever\\".)
B000002WPI|5.0|This is just brilliant; the beats, the Rhymes, the stories, everything's great. I was only 4 when it came out, so I can't really say that it revolutionized rap, but I don't think that it left a long lasting influence, because most new stuff isn't half as good as this. BUY IT! (when you do, check out C.R.E.A.M., Tearz, and Aint' nuttin ta f**k wit.

1592400876|4.0|When I bought Eats, Shoots & Leaves, I was expecting something along the lines of Strunk and White's EOS. However, this book is NOTHING of a real guide. It provides the reader with witty  commentary and general rules for all sorts of punctuation, and for that I appreciate it greatly; however, like said, not a real guide. <br /> <br />The book doesn't really delve deep in punctuation itself, and isn't what you're looking for if you want some hard-core punctuation help. This is a book you would read for some general self-help- not distribute to a class of students for them to take seriously. <br /> <br />If you want a fun read, some giggles, and a few laughs, this is a great book. There's also a lot of punctuation history included in the text, as well as allusions to other punctuation books (probably more hard-core, but I wouldn't know). However, if you really want to help your punctuation, Strunk and White are the people to read, not Trauss. <br /> <br />Still, you have to give the woman props. I hadn't smiled so much for punctuation since I learned how to draw a really cool question mark.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Yes I can already tell you, some things are different in this, but coming from someone who hasn't seen these movies in almost 20 years (i almost bought the VHS set but decided against it) this looks just as good as i remember it and if you havn't seen it in a while, you won't notice the changes. You will notice the better sound and picture quality though. Even having the lousiest tv (besides black and white) you will notice the brilliant visuals and crisp sound. Not only does each of the 3 DVDs have their own extras, but you also get a bonus DVD that has over 2 1/2 hours worth of extras as well as a playable demo version of Star Wars 3 which is only for the X-box (I don't have an x-box so can't tell you how good that is). As my title says though, to have a complete collection, you have to have the box office champions and this classic is one of them.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I was excited to buy this DVD when it came out. The theatrical release of the movie was a disappointment, but I had high hopes for the DVD release.  <br /> <br />The theatrical release of the movie lacked so much information it barely resembled the book. The story seems rushed and compressed to allow the run-time of the movie to fit into the attention span of a 4 year old. The characters are supposed to evolve and grow in the book, but in the movie they are stagnant and predictable. We know Harry is a powerful wizard, we know Hermione is very intelligent. But why has Ron become a wimpy, sniveling and outrageously cowardly character? He is very different from the Ron who plays wizard chess and sacrifices himself to allow Harry to continue in the first movie. But enough about the movie itself... <br /> <br />The DVD is also a disappointment. I was hoping to see the gaggle of deleted scenes that were in the book but cut from the movie to produce such a phenomenally mediocre debacle. But the DVD only contains five deleted scenes. And those scenes are just an extra 10-20 seconds of things that did not need to be in the movie; so I guess I'm glad he deleted them. The cast and crew features are simply a list of the actors and their role in the film. The tours are a bore. The games are confusing and rely on your ability to handle your remote control, and the responsiveness of your DVD player.  <br /> <br />Overall, it is not bad and it is not good, it is simply mediocre. <br />
B000669GAI|4.0|First of all, Pearl Jam is a great band who can just flat out play high quality music time and time again. While I feel their last few albums (exception) have lost some of what made Pear Jam great, they still pop out some great tunes on those albums.  So with that in mind, lets talk about rearviewmirror the Greatest Hits album.  <br /> <br />In of itself, this is a typical greatest hits album.  It is meant to pick off the biggest radio/video hits they have had during a 12 year span.  Personally, while I love many of the songs selected, most of my favorites didn't make the album.  But,again they didn't get the play on the radio as these songs did.  What does it mean, well if you want the great obscure songs that made Pearl Jam, then you will be disappointed.  However, you want the more popular songs of Pearl Jam, the ones that everybody knows, then this is a good bet for ya.  This album will also become one of those intro albums you give to a friend or your kid, like your parent gave you. <br /> <br />However, the question I have... Is Pearl Jam selling out?  Eddie Vedder has long been a advocate against corporate interests and and concerts gave lectures about liberalism,individuality, freedom, and so forth.  This is the band who took on Ticketmaster, disappeared during the fight and ended up losing.  I also think they lost sort of the fun side of Pearl Jam, the side that made them what they were best, a Jam Band.  But, lets put that aside, as I said they can still knock a pitch outta the park.  The question is, this is the upteenth greatest hits album put out by Pearl Jam.  How many concert albums, how many other albums.  You have tons of selections and while their live albums are amazing, how much is too much?  Did we really need another greatest hits album in its essence?  Most of these songs are on any of the live albums, where Pearl Jam is at their greatest.  Heck I thought Riot Act sucked, but watching them at Alpine Valley this summer and they still knock youout with a great show.  But for a group that protests their anti-corporate for the fan mentality, another full priced album of the same songs already on a billion other live albums, isn't this simply selling out in the end to make another quick buck? <br /> <br />It is just a question.  Like I said it is a great album for the Radio hits that made this group huge.  But, in the long run Pearl Jam sold another piece of what once made them kings, by reprinting already printed material,yet again.  Another buck.  Just exactly the very same thing they have preached about.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I bought this CD on impulse, and I have to say- my impulse was right. Franz Ferdinand has a slightly-retro rock sound with thudding bass and drums fronted by catchy guitar lines. Basically, the theme of this CD is \\"catchy.\\" However, catchy doesn't mean poppy. While there is a pop edge in that the songs are upbeat and the words are easy to sing along to, I wouldn't put it anywhere near a pop category. There's no way the corporate companies could come up with something this original. Along with some darker-sounding tracks (Auf Asche, Michael, Jacqueline), there's a lot of fun on this CD too. Upbeat tracks include Take Me Out, Tell Her Tonight, and Come on Home. I would NOT recommend this CD to typical Pop listeners or anyone who's looking for something heavy or sedating. This is something you listen to while lazing in the backseat of your car on a Saturday night, playing with your Converse laces, or dancing around your bedroom in your underwear. Kinda fun, kinda playful, kinda catchy, but nothing childish. <br /> <br />And with that, I highly recommend this CD to anyone who's looking for something fun, well-assembled, and rockin'.

I was feeling so lost and helpless trying to get over my ex-boyfriend but by page 30 I had already moved on. It's actually incredible how much Greg and Liz help you and put it into such plain terms. He makes fun of you, repremands you for all the STUPID actions you had put up with from the one you loved, and makes you feel beautiful and worthy of anything you want. Trust me, if you are having an issue with love, READ THIS BOOK ! You will feel like a completely new person, ready to take on the world. ENJOY!
B0000AM6JI|4.0|Brian DePalma has to be one of the most enigmatic directors working today.  His body of work is a checkered one.  There are the occasional good films (\\"The Untouchables\\",\\"Casualties of War\\"), the bad ones (\\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\"),the Hitchcock rip-offs(\\"Obsession\\", \\"Body Double\\") and those in between(\\"Scarface\\").  \\"Carlito's Way\\" is one of his good ones.  Unlike \\"Scarface\\", this tale of a recently released from prison Puerto Rican hood (Al Pacino)who vows to go straight is a good one.  You fully believe that Carlito is going to go straight and retire to the islands with his Anglo girlfriend (Penelope Ann Miller).  Carlito's fatal flaw is a misguided loyalty to the wrong people, in this case his brilliant but sleazy lawyer(Sean Penn).  The cast is uniformly excellent with Pacino pretty much playing it straight unlike his over-the-top performance in \\"Scarface\\".  Penn is exceptional here.  Miller is good here.  When this film was made, she was being touted as an up and coming actress but her star seemed to wane thereafter.  Viggo Mortensen shows up in a small but effective part as a wheelchair-bound hood.  This film is essentially a thriller and it does deliver more than it's share of thrills and surprises.  This sleeper from the early 90's is well worth checking out.
B00008RH1H|4.0|I'm Ryan Sheppard, from the Nagoya International School, and have recently examined the different and similar qualities of Shakespeare's Macbeth, and Akira Kurosawa's Throne of Blood. <br /> <br />Macbeth is not only one of Shakespeare's best plays, but one of the most well-known plays of all time. Since the cold, rainy day a few hundred years ago when Shakespeare added the finishing touch to his play, and sprinkled it with sand, the ingeniously writen work has been transformed into plays with a mirage of different tastes, flavors, and spices. Although all versions continue to intrigue audiences, there are some traits of the original which are often soiled by unique transformation. Akira Kurosawa's, \\"Throne of Blood\\" was an attempt to recreate Macbeth's sole plot, themes, and characterizations, which turned out to be well-done overall, but unfortunately deprived of Shakespear's quality in some areas. <br /> <br />The basic plot of Macbeth is mostly continuous throughout the \\"Throne of Blood.\\" However there are a few minor additions or cancellations of scenes and details which you would expect to find in any book-based movie. At the beginning of the movie there were a few sequences when the Lord/King's messengers came to his fort notifying him of the fall of his forts. The dramatic series of news breaks from the messenger's was not apparent in the book, nor did it add value to the film. There were also instances of the troops getting a pep-talk from their Japanese Macbeth. Other additions varied, but who would expect a book-based movie to be exactly like the book? <br /> <br />The Japanese setting was quite an effective aspect of the film. Samurai forts fit Shakespeare's feel of armies and forts in the book. The samurai's system of forts ran quite parallel to the English system. Therefore the change made good sense, putting everything in a Japanese perspective. After living in Japan and traveling for several years, I would not say that the landscape I saw on the movie reflected that of the actual Japanese landscape. Regardless of this point, I felt the misty-wet landscape was rather effective when strengthening the dark, chilly and miserable feel of the story.  <br /> <br />The aspect of the movie which struck me the most was the Japanese characterizations of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Macbeth talked with an evil, angry, serious, and almost threatening look on his face. Facial expression was monotonous, except for the rare laugh. Essentially, he had almost the same facial and vocal expression for different emotions-a tense, evil, angry, and aggressive look. Lady Macbeth, even more so, conveyed this sense of emptiness in her voice. When confronted by Macbeth regarding the issue of becoming King/Lord, she persisted that Macbeth should kill Duncan to achieve power of king if he was a real man. Her words are forceful, but her voice and facial expressions are almost nil. This lack of facial expression deprives the characters of excitement and life. However, later on in the movie, when Lady Macbeth assists in the murder of the lord/king and starts vigorously scrubbing the blood of her hands, and sobs with guilt. This is perhaps one of the most powerful scenes in the movie because the quiet, emotionless, calm Lady Macbeth the audience knows is now in an extreme emotional state.  <br /> <br />Taken as a whole, Akira Kurosawa did a good job of transforming Macbeth into a Japanese setting. But having been deprived of some of Shakespeare's qualities as a result of this particular transformation, I do no admire this production as much as Shakespeare's original version. To all those who despise trashy modern movies like Scary Movie and Tomb Raider, but instead enjoy older quality work, like Casablanca, this film is for you!  <br />
B00011CZRE|2.0|Ok so, being a big wuss and it being late at night/early in the morning when I watched this film, I expected to be terrified. Oh no, not so. I read fantastic reviews about this film (which may be why I was quite so disappointed)and although a wimp, I am not squeamish, so (rightly, I might add) I though I wouldn't be scared by all the nasty ideas. I was right. I wasn't scared. At all. The film is quite engaging, I'll give it that. I love Morgan Freeman, particularly that chocolate smooth voice, but I have to say he really felt like he was faintly joking when he played this role. As always, he was good. But by his standards, he was subpar. This film reminded me of 'Along Came a Spider' - both storylines were weak, Morgan Freeman stood out in both and yet was not as good as he could be. Gwyneth Paltrow was as always pathetic - I have yet to see that woman actually act, as opposed to simply be herself (weak, dismal, not entirely there) on screen. If anybody has any films in which she is worth watching, please tell me as I would actually like to be able to change that rather mean opinion. Anyway, back to the point. Brad Pitt was ok, not terrific. The story itself was absolute crap. Let's be fair here. With most horror films/TV detective dramas, the baddie turns out to be someone who is just random and hasn't been picked up on by the viewer beforehand - this is because in real life, that's what it's actually like. Either that, or the film just tries too hard to point you in the wrong direction so you know for sure that it's the person the film directs you away from (as in Along Came a Spider). In this case, the film tries too hard to make the baddie someone we 'recognise' (the likelihood of the baddie actually being the photographer is so, so small). Although having criticised all horror films, I cannot think of another way it could be done. Make it someone connected to the victim but too random, and everyone will watch it saying 'huh? who the heck is that?!'. Make it someone too obvious and people like me will say 'Ugh. Not again. How predictable.'  <br />You can't win really.
B0000019PA|3.0|ok, i've known this record for a few years now.  i think of it as a single piece of music, not a collection of songs.  certainly it is strung together like a suite, and the lyrics are full of repeating themes (like spines) and words (like the very odd configuration \\"could need\\").  i find the lyrics evocative and sometimes nightmarishly creepy (e.g., \\"holy rattlesnakes that fell all round your feet,\\" or using \\"semen stains the mountaintops\\", which is doubly creepy because it's the only place on the album where a phrase is repeated, refrain-like).  there are few artists who can effectively turn word salads into horror shows--syd barrett, don van vliet, occasionally beck (though beck's mostly a humorist).  all in all, i appreciate what is clearly a very personal work of art for jeff mangum.  however, in purely musical terms, i find the songwriting singularly banal.  there's not a single melodic figure on this record that smacks you upside your head; and the chord progressions are obvious and endlessly repeated.  the relative crispness of construction on The King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1 disappears at the arrival of Pt. 2, never to be recovered.  i find myself putting this record in every so often just to play one or two tracks; the whole does not command my interest.  i certainly cannot fathom the rabid devotion it commands in others.
B0006399FS|5.0|Had I written a review for this album when I first heard it (about two weeks before release - and, yes, I have since purchased the album) I would have given it a mere two stars.  Part of the disappointment came because the rest of the album is very unlike Vertigo, the lead single.  Vertigo got me excited about a true blue rocker.  Truth be told, this album is not as subdued as some would have you think.   <br /> <br />After living with this album, catching the more subtle nuances, going over the lyrics, etc, I have come to think very highly of the record.  Like most great works, you don't always recognize their greatness immediately.  In fact, they often initially appear mediocre. <br /> <br />There's plenty to rock out to here.  Vertigo obviously.  Miracle Drug has its rocking moments.  City of Blinding Lights.  All Because of You.  Crumbs from Your Table.  Points in Original of the Species.  This record goes from soft to loud very fast.  Edge's guitar textures are all over the place.   <br /> <br />-AND- <br /> <br />Bono is in top form and not coasting, as has been suggested by some.   <br /> <br />Don't expect to love this record right out of the box.  There's only been one U2 album I adored from the getgo - Achtung Baby - and that was because I had already heard many of the songs. <br /> <br />As for the style, there are elements from every single stage of U2's development to be found, although new implementations can be found.  Bono pushes for the high notes the most since the Boy and October days.  We've got a few chimes that recall Boy.  We've got Edge singing in the background a lot (a great thing!!!).  We've also got some new things here too.  The album doesn't sound like a mere extension of All That You Can't Leave Behind or any of their other albums.  No U2 album really sounds the same, though you can definitely pick up that it's U2 and you can hear elements from the past interjected with new ideas. <br /> <br />Decide for yourself.  There's a lot of great stuff here.  Lyrically, it is quite strong.  I find Bono's allusions to past writings to be no problem - this is something Dylan has done in the past.  It reflects growth of the artist.   <br /> <br />Enjoy.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|The first time I saw advertisements for this movie, I thought it looked boring.  But now that I've seen it for myself, I can say that it was hilarious!  Will Ferrel is great in this movie, cracking jokes and effortlessly acting out the main role of Buddy the elf.  Each actor played their part well, and no one slacked off.  Buddy's first time in civilization was the funniest part of the movie by far!  The second half of the movie wasn't all that funny, though, and I found myself to be slightly disappointed.  The movie also refers to some kind of mature subjects that parents may not approve of. <br /> <br />Overall, I would say that, though not great, this movie was pretty good, and is one that I would recommend as a family movie to families with slightly older children, though it is possible that younger children may not even catch on to the mildly adult stuff.
0553296981|5.0|Anne Frank \\"The Diary of a Young Girl\\" is one of the best books I have ever read.  It is about the Frank family that goes into hiding in World War II.  They live with another family, the Van Dann's, and another man.  In this book the family's go though many troubles and are always on alert.  The lived in the attic for a little over three years and you get to see how Anne matures and becomes a young woman rather than a bothersome child.  We get to see how Anne falls in love with the Van Dann son, Peter, and how they live their day to day life in this old attic. In the book, which is Anne's diary there are many close calls where they are almost discovered.  I really got a better understanding on how the Jews that went into hiding felt, the constant pressure that is always on them.<br /><br /> I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn about the second World War.  I feel that it has made me grateful for what I have and it gives me a whole different view on life.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|When I heard Will Ferrel was the leading role, I wasn't too thrilled. I am not personally a fan... Then after 2 minuts of watching this movie I was Shocked and laughed my way through the whole thing. This is going to be considered a holiday classic many moons from now, I suggest this flick to all generations!
0060512806|5.0|I first read this book on the recommendation of my husband, a hard core Neal Stephenson fan.  I had no idea what to expect, but I absolutely love it. <br /> <br />I take it on airplanes, it goes with us on every trip we take.  He and I fight over who's going to read it next.  Between the two of us, I'd say we've read it 25 times and have offered the greatest homage possible- we quote it to each other and crack up.  (Pig truck! BWAAAHAHAHAHAHA!) (Display some adaptability!) <br /> <br />Lawrence is one of my favorite characters in literature, and Randy is quite possibly a conglomeration of many of my techno geek friends. <br /> <br />No- there are not a lot of fleshed out female characters in the book, but hey- it's about war and computers.  There aren't a whole lot of women involved with either of those, even in this day and age. <br /> <br />I've recommended this book to all my voracious reader friends.  I'd love to pick it for my book club, but I doubt it would fly based on length alone.  Pity...
0553296981|4.0|Anne Frank by Anne Frank<br /><br />The diary of Anne Frank is a great book.  It is about a thirteen year old Jewish girl who lived in Amsterdam during World War II.  When the Nazis start invading towns near by Anne's home her whole family is forced to go into hiding.  They go to her father's factory and stay in the top three levels of the building.  There are a total of seven people that are staying in the Secret Annex.  There is the Frank family; which includes Mr. and Mrs. Frank and their two daughters Margot and Anne.  The other family is the Van Daans; this includes Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan and their son Peter.  Soon Mr. Dussel joins them.  He is a Jewish dentist.<br /><br />At first Anne thinks that it's great that they are going into hiding.  Then she realizes that there are only three ration books for all eight of them to get food.  Even with only three ration book to get food she still manage to be somewhat cheerful.<br /><br />She is always talking back to the Van Daans and putting her two cents in whenever she can.  The Van Daans are always yelling at her, but her father sticks up for her.  Her mother tells her that she shouldn't be talking back to her elders. Her mother is all about manners and Anne doesn't care about manners.  So there is tension through out the story between her and her mother.<br /><br />At first Peter thinks that Anne is a big mouth. Then after about a year of being in hiding together they start to become friends.  Not long after this the Nazis discover their hiding place.  They are sent away to a prison camp and don't know if they will be freed or killed.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book because it was interesting and had some humorous parts.  I never realized how hard it would be to survive in hiding for two years until I read Anne Frank's story.
B00006RU5B|3.0|I have to disagree with the majority of the reviews posted and say that this, to me, is not that great of an album. Good, but not great. It doesn't get much time in my CD player. I find that many of the tracks sound alike, and Chris Cornell's voice never changes. Another problem, and I know this isn't the band's fault, is that I'm tired of hearing all of the songs that were singles because they were overplayed on the radio. Overall, I was expecting more energy and the impressive musicianship we all know these gentlemen are capable of. Having said all of this, many people seem to enjoy this album. Check out the song samples, and if you enjoy them, you'll probably like the album. As for me, I look forward to the next Audioslave album, which Tom Morello has said will be more technical.
B0001Z52RU|2.0|This picture was pretty bad. I find it hard to believe that people actually want to OWN it.  This movie is one for the rental store, trust me.  <br />Ashton plays a college student who is haunted by his boyhood blackouts. While having seemingly outgrown them, he finds a way to re-live those moments by going back in time by re-reading notebooks that he kept from those times because doctors thought it would help him jar the memories of the blackouts. Well, they do, but not in the way that he expects. <br />While suspended disbelief is something we expect from movies, the plotline in this movie is so transparent it is sad.  Combined with poor acting, and even worse makeup coupled with the loud \\"special effects\\" this movie takes a pretty good idea and drops it almost as soon as the movie starts. The characters are shallow and unbelievable and the characters are forced into unrealistic situations. As soon as things start going bad, we are forced to endure another flashback as the situation is taken from bad to worse. <br />Steer clear of this one, it will leave you feeling like you just wasted your time. It is a real shame since it could have been done much better.  I think that giving it 2 stars is generous.
0689859368|4.0|The constantly ignored and underappreciated Jared Grace, his amateur animal expert twin brother Simon, and their slightly older fencing sister have moved into a decrepit Victorian style house with their mother after a messy divorce. They've been allowed to stay in the former residence of their great-aunt Lucinda, whose current domicile is in an insane asylum. From the get-go Jared senses something amiss with the old house when he hears a scuttling within its walls, as though a small animal were moving about in them. After finding the nest of some sort of creature within the walls, a nest which appears to be made by something intelligent, with newspaper clippings and cockroaches strung on a line, well, let's just say the mystery deepens. And what's a tale in ruined house like this without secret passages and rooms. It's all here. Something seems to be angry at the children and begins to take it out on them. Maybe a book Jared found in the attic called \\"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You\\" will help them find out who or what is venting its rage at the kids. <br /> <br />This first of a projected series of five books for children 6-10 years old is a recommended read. It has an exciting plot and some suspense and some little scares, such as when Jared is winched up by his brother and sister in a dumbwaiter in pitch blackness with something hammering on the top of it, trying to get in. It has funny bits, and the fact that the family's father left them adds emotional depth for older readers.  Book I throws in a little mystery and deduction as the kids, especially Jared, try to find out what is going by using clues left by an unknown hand. This was a fun book for the young and the young at heart.
B0006399FS|5.0|I would have to guess that the hardest part of being the worlds greatest rock band would be duplicating your success while being true to your art and not repeating yourself, yet that is what most of the fans who give poor ratings for this album want from the band.  They want another \\"Joshua Tree\\" or another \\"Achtung baby\\"  There are no reverse gears on U2's tank!If you're an fan of their older stuff, listen with new ears.  It is beautiful.  It's everything a U2 album should be. The \\"bomb\\" will blow you away!
B0006399FS|5.0|Being a fan of U2 ever since I heard the Joshua Tree album years ago, I'be waiting for this album to arrive; and it has. U2 has gone back to its \\"original\\" voice and sound, and it sounds incredible. From \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Between A Man and a Woman\\", to \\"Yahweh\\" and \\"...Can't Make It On Your Own\\" (which are my favorites on the album), their sound is back. Every song has its unique sound and voice, and Bono's lyrics are better than ever. Well worth waited for....
B00008YLV2|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a movie that has provoked a curiously mixed response from people.  While most of the credible critics (e.g. Roger Ebert, Peter Travers) rightly gave it high marks, a few well known critics tore into it.  Almost all the negative reviews are characterized by an ignorance of the movie's historical source material, or some kind of extreme political/ideological ax to grind on their part.  This is unfortunate, because Ridley Scott (an Englishman, incidentally) has crafted what may be the definitive war film.   <br /> <br />Black Hawk Down is one thing, and one thing only: a realistic depiction of the Battle of Mogadishu, principally from the point of view of Task Force Ranger.  It is not an overtly political film, and I think this bothered some critics of a certain leftist  or anti-military bent.  By depicting bloodthirsty warlords as... bloodthirsty warlords... it will probably offend those who want to blame every possible bad thing that ever happened to anybody anywhere on American malice.  Likewise, the fact that it treats the people who fought in the battle with a certain respect will offend people accustomed to thinking of American soldiers as baby-killers, or whatever. <br /> <br />However, a critic would have to be literally deranged to consider this a jingoistic film glorifying war.  This is by far the most awful, horrifying and real depiction of war I've ever seen on film.  That includes Saving Private Ryan and We Were Soldiers.  I like fun action movies with senseless violence and destruction, and this movie is one of the least fun things I've ever seen.  Combat is depicted, rightly, as a chaotic nightmare.  I don't see how someone can be a decent human being and enjoy the violence in this film, or interpret it as something that was meant to be enjoyed.  To think that Ridley Scott meant this to be cheesey fun along the lines of other Jerry Bruckheimer-produced flicks would require you to be friggin' insane.  This film is deliberately, unflinchingly brutal.  It is almost saying, \\"Look, you fat lazy bastards, THIS is what it means to send your soldiers to war.  THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS.\\"  And it has no happy ending, because the real battle didn't, either. <br /> <br />Incidentally, it doesn't let anybody \\"off the hook\\" for how the operation went bad and wound up costing so many lives.  Although not a treatise on military planning and tactics, it is clear from the film that there were fatal delays associated with U.S. forces depending on U.N. contingents for heavy ground support, and the proper contingency planning for the sort of thing that happened really hadn't taken place. <br /> <br />To sum up, this film is quite simply the most honest attempt to depict the actual conditions of combat that I have ever seen.  I think \\"honest\\" really is the operative word.  The lack of Hollywood-imposed cheese on the reality of the story is something I found very refreshing.  It spoke of a certain respect for the people involved, something I appreciate as someone who was in the military myself. <br /> <br />The 3-disk set is packed with extras, all very good ones.  You get 3 commentary tracks (Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer, Mark Bowden and the screenwriter, and several veterans of the battle), all of which are excellent.  You get a documentary about making the movie almost as long as the movie itself, which is very good.  And you get several historical documentaries about the Battle of Mogadishu by PBS and The History Channel.  Aside from being good quality, what impressed me about the bonus materials was the impression I got that the cast and crew were determined to NOT be cheesey Hollywood scumbags about the movie, or inject thier own personal halfwit politics into the picture.  They really seemed sincere about just wanting to do justice to the real-life people and events they were depicting. <br /> <br />I think they did right.
B00004W50T|5.0|Well, it is a little frightening when you realize that the Band's albums defy time altogether and that in one way or another all of their songs are linked (yet they seem like seperate far and away efforts). Like another reviewer stated, this is a record that doesn't hold a certain place in any time, and although you'll get some images in your head, you certainly can't rely on them. This album isn't depressing, or bad, or unprofessional in any way. I find it inspirational and even comforting compared to today's music. Yet it still has a hard edge to it, and it seems like it could even be popular with some folks today (understand why I'm concerned--how did Robbie know how to make these songs both timeless and lyrically on top?). If you have never heard the Band before, and you are used to that standard but shameful FM radio polish that is on other records, then you'll need to give them some time and interest before you start saying (rather estatically) how this is the greatest album ever released, like other people who are balling over themselves to do so. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC, rather than dance to it or put it on for a party (and in that case, it is not destined to be certain folks' road music). The sounds are unlike any other sounds, and you'll need to listen to them a while and adjust to their level (as opposed to those folks who think they are so good that they want their music to adjust to THEIR level). After you understand where the Band is coming from, and after you move to their ideas and sonic land, you too will start calling their stuff the best music ever made. I don't need to ramble about how good the record is, and I couldn't anyway because their is so much depth in it. Plain and simple, it is a work of genius, it belongs to their time and our time and all time, it is a work that is both moving and funny, universal and downhome. Quite frankly, I don't know how the guys did it. Dylan wrote \\"I Shall Be Released\\", a song about a prisoner,that closes the album. Robbie wrote a completely different story about a \\"Caledonia Mission,\\" in which a woman has to stay locked up inside mission walls. Is that why Manuel is singing so high in the Dylan cover? Is he imitating her voice or is he someone else? Is it a concept or is it not? See? Pure genius. SO MUCH DEPTH, so much richness, and a lot more too. You get quality and smarts for your dollar. Thanks to the other reviewers who have now told the world how good they feel that this timeless and beautiful piece of art really is.
B0006399FS|5.0|I just wanted to add my opinion of this CD because it seems to be getting a very wide variety of reviews.  I have been a U2 fan since my youth in the 80s.  I have always had to listen to a new U2 album several times to appreciate it.  That's just the way their music is, it's complex!  I have been listening to this album a few times a day since I got it last tuesday, and I have to say the more I listen the more I like it.  Some of it is instantly accessable.  Some of it requires to you to LET THEM paint the pictures and you have to LISTEN to get it.  Moody, eloquent, deep, hopeful, brilliant.  Please listen to this album a few times before you decide on it!  I love U2, and they do not disappoint on this album!  Trust me, as a long time fan, and someone to holds them up to very high standards, this album is great.
B000021XS0|5.0|For a long time in my life I thought that modern music was completely and utterly useless. Until my friend showed my Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory. Dream Theater is now one of my favorite bands and I've looked into new types of music because of this. On the contrary to what the idiot said about Dream Theater. They can play together, they sound good notation wise, their lyrics are genius, and Mike is amazing no matter what he does.
0765301598|3.0|This is the final installament of the Legends of Dune prequels?  <br /> <br />I was not too impressed with the House Trilogy Kevin J. Anderson and Brian Herbert did that ends about 15 years before the original Dune. I liked the first 2 books well enough, but the third book just really disappointed me. The inconsistancies with Frank Herberts Dune were glaring for me. For example, Gurney Halleck owes his loyalty to Duke Leto Atreides because Leto saves his life in the Harkonnen slave mines/pits-in the House Trilogy Gurney hides in a shipment of glass that inadvertently ends up on Caladan. Gurney did not even know who Leto was nor did Leto know who Gurney was. They actually meet through a mutual friend. Which is fine, but kills the relationship for the first 3 original Dune novels. Stupid little slips like that made me dislike the House Trilogy novels. <br /> <br />In the Kevin J Anderson and Brian Herbert novels much detail is given, but no suspense is built, everything is spelled out for you-no thinking required. It is the spirit of how Frank Herbert wrote and it is unfair to expect K.J.A and B.H. to be able to copy that-but I am disappointed none the less. It is difficult to write in a well known world and not make errors-especially when it is not the world you created.  <br /> <br />When I heard that Kevin J. Anderson and Brian Herbert were doing Dune novels set during the time of the Butlerian Jihad I was very excited. I figured with them going so far into the past it would not matter that much if the story had alot of inconsistancies-many records were lost from that time period anyway. I figured I would be able to enjoy novels set in the Dune universe and, since I am not attached to any of the characters in the novel, who cares how K.J.A. and B.H. portray them. Plus many questions could be answered:  <br />How did the feud begin between House Atreides and House Harrkonen? <br />How did the Spacing Guild get its beginning? <br />How did the Bene Gesserit begin? <br />How was the first Mentat developed? <br /> <br />The ground work for all of those questions to be answered was laid out splendidly in the first book-The Butlerian Jihad. The groundwork was being laid for the answers to the questions I had about the Spacing Guild, the Butlerian Jihad, The Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the strict ban on thinking machines. Sadly, the second and third book focused mostly on wars and fighting. It did answer the questions but in a very unsatisfactory way-I was hoping for brie and wine followed by prime rib and chocolate mousse and instead got cheese whiz on ritz crackers with Boones Farm  followed by salisbury steak and instant jello pudding.  <br /> <br />All in all I highly reccomend reading it for any fan of the Dune novels. I am still looking forward to book 7 which they will supposedly start now. I am sure they will botch the attempt but supposedly Frank Herbert left a rough draft and perhaps they will gently change that.
B0002KVUL6|4.0|Ok ok I went into VH with my head lowered in shame but once this guilty as charged cheez fest kicked into high gear I couldnt help but enjoy myself.<BR>Stephen Sommers has allways been a so/so director and his Mummy and Scorpion King films have never really warranted any praise from me but I faithfully went to see all three of them hoping that his craft would reach a high point.<BR>Van Helsing is not that movie but it did bring me to the conclusion that the man loves his Universal Monsters and thats allright too I guess as long as he doesnt try his hand at romantic comedies or dramadies....now that would be scare me.
B00000099Y|1.0|omg this is so crappy i mean it s not even music its just wierd noises, and who makes a 11 minute song? really cmon. anyway my true opinion on this is that who ever likes it doesnt know music because it sucks, if you want real music try good charlotte or simple plan at least they can play their instruments. i am sick of people saying this is music \\"oh tool are cool\\" no their not!! <br /> <br />AIM screen name is: yoohooscoobydoo
0783233477|5.0|If you aren't fond of drama or romance this won't be the movie for you.  If you aren't fond of long movies with a lot of dialogue this won't be the movie for you.  If you like quality acting, a great score and an interesting storyline you'll be pleasantly surprised. <br />Don't rely on the critics or \\"professional\\" reviews.  Watch this movie and find out for yourself.
B00006RJHG|5.0|In the late 1970's(about the time the first Superman movie came out), I remember watching a movie on HBO called, 'Stranger in the House' with Margot Kidder.  For years I tried to find that movie on video or dvd without any luck.  A few months ago I was surfing the Amazon web site and read several positive reviews of a movie called 'Black Christmas' starring Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder.  I began reading the description and was amazed by the similarities. My search was over.  This was indeed the same movie....but why did I remember it under another name?   <br /> <br />I immediately ordered the special edition of the movie.  Mystery solved!  The special features included two alternate openings; one showing the movie as I remember it with the 'Stranger In The House' title, as well as another one showing a third title, 'Silent Night, Evil Night.' It has a really great featurette on the making of the movie, but still no explanation as to why three different titles were used.[If anyone knows the answer to this, please email me with it.] <br /> <br />Let me give you a scenario to help describe how scary this movie is.  I remember going to my mother the night I watched it and asking her if the attic in our house was large enough for someone be in. Thankfully, it wasn't. She even had my father get a ladder and show me that the inside of our attic was barely tall enough for anyone to stand in, just so I could sleep that night.  Of course, I was only eight or nine years old at the time.  However, I'm now 35 now and it still gave me the creeps!  Needless to say, I was not disappointed, nor will you be!  The fact that you never actually see the killer makes it even more terrifying and mysterious.  I wish newer horror movies would go back to this technique of 'using the camera as the killer.'Also, this movie has some of the most creative death scenes I have seen to this day.(Remember, the house mother peaking into the attic?) <br /> <br />I highly recommend the Special Edition for true horror movie collectors, even though the sound quality is poor on portions of the featurette.  Still, it was really interesting to be given a tour of the infamous house 30 years later.
B000002G26|4.0|Bryan Adams has had a very successful career in mainstream rock music, and this 1993 hits package covers the first 10 years, during which time he had 2 massive-selling rock ballad #1 hits and chart-topping albums Reckless (1984) and Waking Up The Neighbours (1991). The 14 songs here are all very direct, simple statements done either as slow, extended ballads or as guitar-driven rock-n-rollers. There's nothing particularly subtle about his music, but his nostalgic rock tune Summer Of '69 remains a favourite, and I also like Heat Of The Night  and the scorching affair Run To You (his first Australian  chart hit). Overshadowing all his other songs is Everything I Do (I Do It For You), which is one of the most popular love songs ever. It expresses the sort of everlasting romantic love that appeals to just about everyone.  <br /> <br />Since 1993's Please Forgive Me (included here), another chart-topping love ballad, Bryan Adams has recorded lots more songs, and has a second (single-disc) hits album (Best Of Me) that has a similar but somewhat less-classic tracklisting. So, at least for now until A&M put out a 2CD set, this is the one to get.
B000093BDX|4.0|Just what we need -- another greatest hits comp by the Beach Boys.  Good if you don't have Endless Summer, Greatest Hits Vol 1-3, Spirit of America, Made in America, Greatest Car Songs, Greatest Surfing Songs, Good Vibrations: 30 Years of the Beach Boys, Classics, et al.  At the very least it's mastered in 24-bit.  Whooppee.
B000001FS6|5.0|This was THE album of 1988. U2 had toured extensively and conquered the rock world in 1987, and this 17-track album was a mix of live tracks from the Joshua Tree tour, studio demo type stuff, a couple of bits of sound they found on their travels (Freedom For My People) and a few really good new songs. I happen to love all the new songs on here, and the live stuff is also pretty good, though having seen the Rattle&Hum  movie, they left off the two highlight live tracks: Sunday Bloody Sunday and Where The Streets Have No Name. <br /> <br />My rating of the new studio songs: <br /> <br />Helter Skelter- A raucous Beatles hard-rock cover version opens this disc (and the movie) stunningly. <br /> <br />Van Diemen's Land - This emotional folk ballad is about the leaving of the Old World for the New. It has special relevance for we Tasmanians as Van Diemen's Land was the old name for Tasmania when it was a harsh, brutal European penal colony in the 19th Century. <br /> <br />Desire - Driving 3-minute rock at its basic best. It's all about the energy and the passion. A great #1 hit single <br /> <br />Hawkmoon 269 - densely packed thunderous rock song, full of yearning intensity. Really good. <br /> <br />Silver And Gold - makes its first appearance on a U2 album as a live cut. Dates from U2's Amnesty crusade in 1986.  <br /> <br />Angel Of Harlem - I love this tribute to the giants of 20th Century American music. Works even better live in concert as a guaranteed singalong favourite.  <br /> <br />Love Rescue Me - slow building, guitar based blues-styled song.  <br /> <br />Heartland - My favourite song on the album. This is a wonderful U2 song evoking glorious imagery and feelings about the Heartland of America the band had been discovering during their 80's tours of the USA. <br /> <br />God Part II - \\"You glorify the past when the future dries up\\" Here, U2 writes a sequel to John Lennon's famous track God. It's really good too.  <br /> <br />When Love Comes To Town - Strong imagery, impassioned vocals and inimitable slide guitar from master musician B.B King make this a truly memorable song <br /> <br />All I Want Is You - it is U2's most direct love song - a classic hit and a fitting way to end an epic album  <br /> <br />5 stars from me  <br /> <br />
B00003CXSP|5.0|I think this is the best of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy. I also think Julianne Moore did much better as Clarice than Jodie Foster. Jodie Did good, but I liked Julianne better as Clarice. Ridley Scott did a terrific job and I like this one because Hannibal is out and about and not locked up. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Hannibal and as far as the dvd, it is worth buying because it has extras you only dream of.
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta Goodrem's first album Innocent Eyes has been a phenomenal success here in Australia, and has sold over a million copies here (that's one for every 19 Australians!!). As an 18-year-old singer/songwriter/pianist from Sydney, Australia, Delta recorded this album in 2002 after 2 years of preliminary work, a TV soap acting role, and one early non-hit single I Don't Care (2001). The major difference here is that she is really talented and has a great singing voice, unlike so many modern pop stars, many of whom have marketability but sadly are lacking in musical talent.  <br />The first single Born To Try is an inspirational self-penned power ballad that features Delta's spectacular vocal ability. It is an excellent song, and became her first #1 hit in December 2002. The following single Lost Without You was a lost-love tune that also climbed to #1 at the time of the album release. Delta's profile was sky-high as she was doing media/promotions galore in mid-2003 when her 3rd single Innocent Eyes - a piano tune with autobiographical lyrics - gave her a rare triple #1 hit.  <br /> <br />In July 2003, disaster befell the young star as she was sadly affected by serious illness. At this time her 4th song Not Me, Not I was released. This is a lovely tune featuring piano, strings, great choruses and a haunting video filmed when Delta already knew of her illness. Deservedly, it was also a huge hit, again making #1. What happened next was an almost unprecedented wave of popular support for Delta and for her album as most pop music supporters in the country took her music and her plight to heart as she began medical treatment for Hodgkin's disease. She made an emotional appearance at the industry's ARIA awards night in October 2003 to collect armfuls of trophies for her music, but could not perform or do promotions while ill. <br /> <br />From being a merely-very-successful chart-topping album, Innocent Eyes took off into the sales stratosphere in the second half of 2003 and over Christmas to become one of the most popular albums ever on the Australian chart. Delta's anthem Born To Try remained high on radio playlists, and in December a 5th single Predictable was released along with her version of the seasonal standard Happy Xmas (War Is Over) as a bonus \\"B-side\\" CD single. Predictably, it hit #1 here!!!  <br /> <br />Looking at the other songs here though, I reckon there are at least another four songs that could have been singles too; particularly some lovely tunes like Butterfly, Longer, My Big Mistake and the sad anniversary lament of A Year Ago Today. With this many winning tunes on one disc, it is no wonder that young people and adults all over the country and also in UK/Europe have been captured by Delta Goodrem's Innocent Eyes.  <br />Happily,it seems she has been recovering her health, and has just returned with a new album Mistaken Identity, released this month, and is planning to tour in 2005. <br /> <br />And to top it all, she is one attractive young lady!!  <br /> <br />This is a pop album for everyone, and the start of hopefully a long and bright musical career. I'm giving it 5 stars.
B0002TT0NW|2.0|I am a devoted Harry Potter book fan who has thusfar enjoyed the WB attempts at recreating the magical realm of Rowling. The first two films were very well cast and executed by Chris Columbus and crew, but Prisoner of Azkaban was a big disappointment.<br /><br />1) It is a shame about Richard Harris (Dumbledore), and replacement Michael Gambon just didn't carry the role. In HP3, Dumbledore plays a larger portion of the plot than in HP1 or HP2 - but the bumbling idiot facade just didn't go over well in my opinion, especially in scenes where he interacted with the kids.<br /><br />2) Director Cuaron cleaved much of the plot(understandably, since you can't market a 6 hour film, though we Potter fans wouldn't mind it being so long), but it left much to be desired in the rearrangement of the events that rushes the viewer initially with the action of Aunt Marge's visit, and then slowly drags through the rest of the streamlined plot - ending with sipmle pleasure of riding the Firebolt - not resolution of truth and conflict.<br /><br />3) The empty places in dialogue - Cuaron leaves artistic expression to substitute explanation - and it makes it difficult for non-HP readers to grasp the entirety of the scenes. Specifically, when Hermione walks out of Divination without a word, and the chirping bird gets eliminated by the Whomping Willow. Dark is ok - but explain it, sometimes only a few seconds more of dialogue were needed to complete the scene.<br /><br />4) The humor was slapstick and lackluster. JK Rowling incorporated hilarious dialogue in her books - and so much of it would have been very easy to slip into the comparable scenes of Cuaron, snide, intelligent humor. Even attempts at sarcastic humor came off poorly.<br /><br />5) Sorry - but that's totally not what I perceived as a werewolf - perhaps something a little hairier?<br /><br />6) Granted that the kids were seemingly more relaxed in their characters, but did they abolish the uniform rule? Sloppy looking costuming, loose ties, untucked shirts, etc, just looked bad.<br /><br />As for the DVD -<br /><br />1) What happened to the cardboard box of the first two releases on DVD? Now its the cheaper, plastic casing. Yuck.<br /><br />2) Those 5 measly deleted scenes were hugely disappointing - you mean to tell me that ONLY 5 scenes in the WHOLE 2.5 hour movie were cut?<br /><br />3) Interviews were somewhat empty, and although nice to have, but the whole talking shrunken head thing was stupid. I don't even like the silly thing in the main menu - of all the scenes to make into the main menu - why that one? It was funny for the few scenes on the bus, and then, that should have been it with the talking head.<br /><br />Its a shame, because it looked like Warner Bros was trying desperately to include the 12 and under crowd in the marketing, and it just alienated the older potter fans. This is not a children's movie - and I think that if you aren't old enough to read and understand the books, that you shouldn't be the marketing target of this movie. Thusly, the plot shouldn't be watered down for the sake of the young'uns.<br /><br />Prisoner of Azkaban is still my favorite book, and I'll be going to see the 4th movie in 2005, but lets hope that the new director, Mike Newell can pull it off better than Cuaron - and let Cuaron get away from the Harry Potter series and artistically master something that needs the help, rather than strip a good quality plot down to bare bones.
B0002VEXUA|3.0|As much as I love Oasis, or at least pre-new millenium Oasis, watching Oasis recent re-release of their debut \\"Definitely Maybe\\", I was struck by how self-aggrandizing it all really is. <br />The record itself, now including the Noel sung \\"Sad Song\\", origanelly availble on the vinyl version of the album and really shows Noel's affinity for Neil Young, sounds great in its 5:1 Stereo Surround. Each note is clearer, the vocals rawer, and the whole procedding sounds as new as it did on its release in 1994. <br />The bonus features however leave a little bit too be desired. Although it took me a few seconds to grasp how to access the features(you have to press up, down, left or right buttons on your DVD controller to see the features or can access them from hitting the menu button, I found what was there to be interesting occassiaonlly, worthless occasionally and always self aggrandizing. <br />The documentary that chronicles the album is interesting enough, breaking the record down track by track, with some interesting tidbits about some of the songs(I never knew that \\"Supersonic\\" was written, recorded and mixed in one night) and some things that are really kind of \\"my god we are (were?) a great band\\"(Noel's proclaimation that \\"Live Forever\\" is one of the greatest records of all time). <br />The live footage is scattershot, although I really like the live clip of \\"Supersonic\\", and the music videos are interesting to watch once, but I doubt anyone will care to watch them more than that. <br />As a matter of fact, that pretty much sums up this whole DVD release. Nothing here is really awful, but nothing here really requires you to watch it more than once. <br />If you are an Oasis fan, then you will definitely enjoy this disc. If you are new to the Oasis camp however, I suggest you buy the origanel version of the album over this re-release of it.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril's breakthrough album \\"Let Go\\" established her as the 'anti-Britney,' if you will, a semi-punk 'sk8er grrl' that sang songs that she might actually have had a hand in writing.  Wow, honesty from a Canadian songbird that rapidly outgrew her Alanis-clone start to become an artist in her own right.  Unfortunately, most artists' second album suffers from vapor lock -- all their good stuff that got them the record deal went on the first album, leaving them a bit short on the second outing.  The very best recover from the 'sophomore slump' and go on to keep us rocking for years to come.<br /><br />What's nice about Ms. Lavigne is that there's no slumping in this album.  The anthemic \\"Don't Tell Me\\" could serve as a recruiting song for the abstinence crowd, and \\"My Happy Ending\\" compares favorably in maturity and power with \\"sk8er boi\\" or \\"I'm With You.\\"  The songs also compare favorably with more 'mature' singers such as Sheryl Crow, who uses the work of obscure poets for some of her lyrics.  Avril doesn't have the depth of a Sarah McLachlan, but then again, she's not yet 20.  Give her some time to mature and blossom, and we're likely to be awed by where she goes.  Doubtful?  Buy this album, and decide for yourself.  While you're at it, pick up the \\"Avril Live Acoustic\\" EP, which is our heroine with her guitar and some light accompaniment -- no studio tricks, no multiple tracks, just the music and the artist responsible for it.  You'll be glad you did.
076790592X|1.0|I had heard of this book and knew there was a movie starring Jack Lemon as Morrie, but I had no desire to read it until I read Albom's latest book, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\"  I was charmed by the latter, and thought \\"Tuesday's With Morrie\\" might have the same affect.  Well, I am glad I read \\"Five People\\" first, because if I had read \\"Morrie\\" first, I never would have wanted to read another book by Albom and would have missed \\"Five People.\\"  Yes, the text is moving, but it seems to me to be in a manipulative way.  Album had 14 Tuesday sessions with Morrie, and yes, the last two were sparse because of Morrie's rapidly approaching death.  But out of the other 12 - most of which were tape recorded - it seems that Albom would have gotten more material from his former teacher to give us a book longer than 190 short pages filled with lots of white space.  Hopefully, he took more notes in class than he took here.  It is like Albom is only feeding us lines from these 14 meetings that he knows will tug at our heartstrings.  It is like eating the frosting on the cake and leaving the rest behind.  Sugary philosophy from a simple book.  Lightweight at best.
B0006399FS|5.0|I've heard many reviewers say they don't like this album because it doesn't \\"rock\\". Talk about narrow minded. I've also heard many say that Bono has lost his voice. I will admit it may not be in the same state that it was back in the 80's but give the guy a break he's been touring for over 20 years. Just because he's not belting it out 100% of the time we automatically assume he's a bad singer. I personally think the way Bono sings on this album is beautiful and full of soul. The age on his voice is inviting and honest. I'm confused as to what these people giving the negative reviews were really looking for. I'll admit that the rest of the album doesn't sound much like \\"Vertigo\\", so this may come as a surprise when you first buy the album, but give it a chance. I have yet to listen to this CD and not be moved, and to those that hate this CD simply because it doesn't \\"rock\\". GROW UP! Hear the album for what it is and stop getting disappointed because it didn't fit the box that you wanted it to fit in.
037542217X|5.0|In this hilarious and yet touching addition to the Number One Ladies' Detective Agency series, the ultra-proper and ultra-serious Mma Makutsi, she of the very large glasses and formidable secretarial powers, has Met A Man! As devotees of the series know, Mma Makutsi is fast approaching that age where men no longer want to marry, and she has not been lucky in love.<br /><br />Will this time be different? Or...as the reader and Mma Ramotswe fear...has the very careful Mma Makutsi been caught in the cluthes of a Bad Man?<br /><br />That's only one of the connundrums in this highly entertaining book, that finds Precious Ramotswe still unmarried, still solving mysteries, and strained to her last nerve by a male detective who is trying to usurp her business.<br /><br />Absolutely a gem from page one to the end. This is simply a series NOT to be missed.
B000001FRY|5.0|I remember hearing this album for the first time in 1980 when I walked into a record shop looking for something to buy.  It was a really dry time for me musically.  There was nothing that interesting - it was all angry yelling (ala punk) or post-'70's rock (ala Kansas, Journey).  But the minute I heard the guitar and atmosppheric, etheric vocals on this I was mezmerized.  Even then, I knew these guys were going to be great!  When I listen to it now and it brings tears to my eyes. <br /> <br />A MUST have for any music collection.  It is a classic as far as I'm concerned and changed the sound of music from that moment on...
B000068OSK|5.0|The White Stripes first album is their second best, only being surpassed by De Stijl. <br /> <br />For me, this album has serious staying power. It's really the only White Stripes album I still listen to (and De Stijl). Usually when I buy an album I listen to the song(s) that I'm familliar with, and maybe the first one or two. Then about 2 months later I begin to listen to the rest of the album. When I bought this album, I didn't know any of the songs, I only really bought it to own all of the White Stripes albums, so I didn't really have anything to listen to when I bought it. So I listened to the whole thing the first time I listened to it. That was the first time I did that, and the last, not because I just didn't bother to, but because I couldn't swallow it. This album is just too irrisistable. <br /> <br />My personal favourites are Stop Breaking Down, A GREAT Robert Johnson cover; Cannon, with a great guitar riff and a nice section with some Son House lyrics; Astro, the only tune that I am forced to sing along to; Do, with some of the White Stripes best lyrics; Screwdriver, the single best guitar on the album and St. James Infirmary Blues, I don't know why I like this song so much, I guess I really like the piano in it; It's one of their best songs. <br /> <br />People complain about it being one in about 10,000 garage rock revival bands (and I could name about 3/4 of them), and Meg's drumming, I say if it sounds good, who cares? And people complain about Jack's vocals and repetivness and I say that you can have your opinion, but you are probably outnumebered about 100 to 1 on this one. <br /> <br />The reason I am deducting half a star is because of the pointless and boring songs: Slicker Drips and Little People. I don't see why the included these songs. They sound like B-Sides for B-Sides.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Elf is the story of Buddy (Will Ferrell) the oversized and adopted elf who leaves the north pole in search of his real human father (James Caan) who works in New York City. Elf's weak points probably come in an overlong and somewhat contrived ending, but Will Ferrell, a great supporting cast (including Bob Newhart), and the New York City backdrop still make it fun to watch. In the world of Christmas movies, Elf is probably not a classic when compared to A Christmas Carol, It's a Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street, or more modern Christmas classics such as Prancer and A Christmas Story, but it is good Christmas fun.
B00005JLKN|4.0|I liked the first attempt to bring \\"Red Dragon\\" to the screen, 1986's \\"Manhunter\\", but I actually prefer this version. It is not as fast-paced, and the secondary characters are generally better developed, making it easier to care about what happens to them.   \\"Manhunter\\" may have been a bit closer to the letter, as some claim, but to me \\"Red Dragon\\" is the better movie.    Brian Cox was excellent as Hannibal Lecter in \\"Manhunter\\", but you just can't beat Anthony Hopkins, and Edward Norton is sublime as Special Agent Will Graham, the man who captures Hannibal Lecter.  But it's Ralph Fiennes as Francis Dolarhyde who really steals the show, bringing an incredible depth and nuance to what could very easily be a stereotypical character, and \\"Red Dragon\\", unlike the gory \\"Hannibal\\", is certainly worthy of its relationship to \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\", even if \\"Lambs\\" is ultimately a better and more original story.  Definitely recommended.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have never been a Green Day fan until now. I heard \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" on ITunes and instantly bought and loved it. It motivated me to buy the whole album. I was really excited to hear the 'rock opera' that \\"American Idiot\\" is. In my opinion, the songs on this album are better than \\"When I Come Around\\" and \\"Good Riddance\\". <br /> <br />1. American Idiot (2:54) B+ <br />This song is a fast beginner song that basically introuduces the plot. It gets really annoying after a while and I don't understand why it gets so much hype. It's good, but not THAT good. <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia (9:08) <br />Contains many seperately rated songs in one 9-minute package. <br />I. Jesus of Suburbia (---) A- <br />Great lyrics. Much better than \\"American Idiot\\". Introduces the main character - or one of them - Jesus of Suburbia. No, not JESUS. <br />II. City of the Damned (---) A- <br />More great lyrics and continues on from \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\". It's a slow, addictive song that is easy to like. <br />III. I Don't Care (---) B+ <br />This song is kind of annoying. After Green Day stops repeating 'I don't care if you don't', the song gets much better. Fast like \\"American Idiot\\" and has a lot of power in it. <br />IV. Dearly Beloved (---) A- <br />The music in this song is fun while the lyrics are kind of sad. This song is really good and a relief of the mediocrity of \\"I Don't Care\\". <br />V. Tales of Another Broken Home (---) A- <br />Great rock. This is what we're talking about! Dives deeper into the plot and ends one of the two nine minute wonders. <br />3. Holiday (3:52) A- <br />Contains more Bush-Bashing started in \\"American Idiot\\", but this song is much better. Great lyrics, catchy riff. Compared to Track 4 though, \\"Holiday\\" does not seem that great. Otherwise a good entry in this rock opera. <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams (4:20) A+ <br />Best song on the album. Great lyrics and great music. It can't get much better than this. Kind of sad, but it really doesn't matter given how awesome this song is. This song made me a Green Day fan. <br />5. Are We The Waiting (2:42) A <br />A really good slow song, following the masterpiece that was \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\". This song continues the great story told in this album. It marks Jesus' need to change the identity. Great song. <br />6. St. Jimmy (2:55) A- <br />This song introduces Jesus' friend, Jimmy. He's more messed up than Jesus of Suburbia. Look at the lyrics closely and it'll foreshadow the end of the story. Great, fast, classic Green Day. <br />7. Give Me Novacaine (3:25) A- <br />I like the Hawaiian feel of this song. As the song title would clue in, the song is about Jesus wanting some medicine to help him feel better. Good lyrics, great music. <br />8. She's A Rebel (2:00) A- <br />We meet Whatsername, who St. Jimmy and Jesus like. She will only make things harder for them, if possible. Great lyrics, and even though the song is short, the music guides you through. <br />9. Extraordinary Girl (3:33) A <br />This is a great song. I like the Indian-feel intro, but I'm still confused on why so many songs nowadays has Indian music in it. Anyway, this song is also about Whatsername. If things look bad in this song, things will only get worse in \\"Letterbomb\\". <br />10. Letterbomb (4:06) A <br />Great intro! Foreshadows to the song \\"Nobody Likes You\\". Beyond the intro, this song is the turning point in the story. This song is a sang letter, which is written by Whatsername. I won't give away the ending, but let's just say, it's not pretty. Great music, great lyrics, great listen, great song. <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends (4:45) A <br />A sad but great song. You would think the song after \\"Letterbomb\\" would be sad, especially after what Whatsername said. This song starts the deeper depression of Jesus and St. Jimmy. Great music and great lyrics. I know I'm saying great way too much, but everything on this album is just simply great! <br />12. Homecoming (9:18)  <br/>The second (and last) 9 minute compilation song of \\"American Idiot\\". It wraps up the plot of this gripping story. <br />I. Death of St. Jimmy (---) A <br />Great song. You can guess what happens by the song title, but I won't give away how, but that's quite evident also. Awesome delivery of the song on Green Day's part, though. <br />II. East 12th Street (---) A- <br />Mid-tempo rock song which is not as sad as \\"The Death of St. Jimmy\\". The break of little guitar parts in the chorus of this song is kind of like comic relief. Great music and lyrics. I am so repetitive. <br />III. Nobody Likes You (---) A- <br />Terrible vocals that sound like they're screamed, but great lyrics and music, so it is covered up. I think the screamed vocals are intentional because of the sadness of this song. You heard it sang by a girl at the beginning of \\"Letterbomb\\" <br />IV. Rock & Roll Girlfriend (---) A- <br />Being the only song sang and written by the drummer, Tre Cool, it's pretty good. Kind of retro if you listen to the lyrics. Kind of misplaced I think. Short and sweet. <br />V. We're Coming Home Again (---) A <br />The longest part of the \\"Homecoming\\" masterpiece. Kind of the pre-finale. It actually seems like a compilation of a song, because it changes tempo mid-song. Great. Just great. I love the part of the song where Green Day sings \\"Home...We're coming home again.\\" The lyrics and music in this song are very good. <br />13. Whatsername (4:14) A <br />This is the last song in the rock opera. Well sung, great lyrics, and cool music. An awesome way to end up the album. An epilogue of sorts. Whoo. What an album. <br /> <br />This album easily gets an A. There are two semi-bombs and all of the rest are great rock tunes compiled to create a story. Green Day, you rock. BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LOVE ROCK. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, if you want the other best rock album ever, buy \\"Americana\\" by The Offspring. Not a rock opera, but contains a lot of fun, well sung songs with good music. <br /> <br />Buy \\"American Idiot\\" or you'll BE an American Idiot!
0060931736|4.0|Miss Jean Brodie is a spinster and a teacher who can teach anything to her students. But she is a peculiar teacher. She doesn't care spending her class times with mathematics, history, English and all other regular subjects. She prefers to explore life, to teach her set of students --the chosen ones-- how to deal with life, love, friends and have good manners. Of course she will have problems with the school administration.<br /><br />This is a summary of Muriel Spark's most important novel, \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" in a nutshell. And however the book is really short, it has a wide range of subject and characters. The writer explores not only the life of her heroine but also the existence of a couple of her students. Part of the characters is very human and part is rather archetypical. It would top notch if the author could have transformed all of them in human beings. However it turns out not to be a problem, since the narrative is quite entertaining and an interesting portray of a time.<br /><br />The best creation is, of course, Miss Jean Brodie. She sounds stereotypical some time, some times a little naïve, but never uninteresting. She has advices for everything: \\"speech is silver, but silence is golden\\", a window can be opened more than six inches, it would be too vulgar; and so it goes. While for her girls they are quite important, for the readers they can be rather amusing. It is impossible to one not the wonder weather those advices are for real or some far fetched thoughts from Miss Brodie's mind.<br /><br />Using the style of anticipation, early in the narrative we learn things that will only happen many years later, like the fact that one girl will betray Miss Brodie, and that another one will become a Sister. This device may put off some readers due to the fact it cuts short the surprise in the narrative.<br /><br />However much I liked Miss Brodie and her adventures, I've never felt really connected to the book. There was always something missing to make me sink in the narrative and in the lives of the characters. Maybe a lack of emotion --most of it read a little to superficial to me--, or the theme --this may be a novel that have more connection with girls. But, I still recommend \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\". It is a fast an interesting read.ng missing to make me sink in the narrative and in the lives of the characters.

B0006399FS|5.0|Well, safe to say these guys won't stop reinventing themselves.  But this time they went back to their roots and fine tuned them with the result being perhaps their most solid album.  Overall, \\"Sometimes you Can't Make It On Your Own,\\" \\"Vertigo,\\" and \\"All Because of You\\" are the best tracks, but all are good.  I highly recommend it.
B0006399FS|1.0|I've listened to this album once.  I don't like it.  I have been a U2 fan since the day that Achtung Baby came out.  I wasn't a fan before that, but since then I've gone forward with the band and then went backward to appreciate everything before Achtung Baby.  In my opinion what U2 does best is write songs that are distinctive.  No song on any U2 album, since Achtung Baby, sounds like any other song on that album.  My test is, \\"can I hum the song to someone and have them recognize it?\\".  Other than Vertigo, all of these songs just seem so vague and similar.  There don't appear to be any hooks or riffs that are creative.  All of these songs should be named Generic Song 1, Generic Song 2, and so on.  This totally kills me because I LOVE U2.  Now, I have only listened to it once.  The problem is, with the exception of Pop, I've never needed to listen to a U2 album more than once to know if I like it.  It's very possible that after a few more listens I will like this album, and I will edit this review if I do.  But so far it just seems uninteresting.  So you know where I'm coming from, here's how I feel about the latter U2 albums:<br /><br />All that you....:  I liked this alot, with a few exceptions:  Grace, New York and Wild Honey.  Even though I didn't like those songs they didn't sound like any of the other songs.<br /><br />Pop:  Hated at first.  I originally thought that Larry didn't even play on this album and that a drum machine was used.  After more listening it was just very \\"produced\\" with lots of effects.  With the exception of Discotheque I now love this CD.<br /><br />Zooropa:  50/50  Hated Numb, Some Days Are Better Than Others, most of Lemon, but again, every song was distinctive.<br /><br />Achtung Baby:  With the exception of Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses? I love every song on this album.  Wild Horses has even grown on me a little.<br /><br />Everything before Achtung needs no comment.  I'll listen to this CD on the way to and from work and give it more chances, only because it's U2.  If it were any other band it would be on it's way to the used record store.<br /><br />I should note that I may be a \\"victim of the overhype\\".  Before I got it I kept hearing how great it was, this could have raised my expectations higher than can be reached.  Kind of like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  This album kind of reminds me of that movie.  Star Wars fans will get it.<br /><br />PS  I have to add that the people who are giving this album 5 stars because some people are giving it 1 star are ridiculous.  I've seen people give it a higher rating than they think it deserves because they think it deserves a higher average.  Look at that.  Does that make sense?  You are scewing the results because YOU believe the average should be higher.  The average should be exactly what it is, average.  If you think it should only get 4 stars, just give it 4 and let the average come out legitimately.  You aren't doing anyone any favors by making the album appear better than it actually is.work and give it more chances, only because it's U2.

B0006399FS|5.0|This truly is one of those \\"it will grow on you with repeated listens\\" albums, for sure, and I defy any of the \\"one-star reviewers\\" here to play the album many times and come back dissing it like they have. Is it their best album ever? I can't really say it is, but after the half-hearted \\"ATYCLB\\" and \\"Pop\\", which, while excellent by any standards, still have me reaching for the \\"skip\\" button on several tracks (and, lest we not forget the lamentable \\"Zooropa\\", which means they haven't done anything totally earth-shattering since \\"Achtung\\".) On this, the Edge does the talking again, much to my liking - the shimmering, chiming guitars that are their best trademark are back in large amount, and while Bono's voice does, indeed, seem a bit stretched these days, this is the U2 we all love. Every song, to some extent, is a winner, and several are already classics. (Who else can make music that sends a little chill down your spine, as many songs on this album do?) So, do what I did - listen, listen again, and concentrate while doing so (no TV, no gazing out the window, or even listening in the car with all that distraction). Sit, absord, and enjoy another great album by the World's Greatest Rock Band. Who else can do it better???
B000002KO3|5.0|I can't tell you how many nights I spent as a young teenager listening to REMAIN IN LIGHT over and over in the dark with my headphones on - this is truly the BEST album by the HEADS where it all came together and showed us all the way to the future - a HUGE leap forward from their earlier quirky/punky NYC art rock, REMAIN IN LIGHT can be seen as BRIAN ENO featuring TALKING HEADS, but no matter - the riffs, the grooves, the sheer mind-blowing, jaw-dropping brilliance of it all, both in content and executiion, makes this album peerless - one of the best albums of all time, no kidding - I happen to like the LP tracks (BORN UNDER PUNCHES, CROSSEYED AND PAINLESS, SEEN AND NOT SEEN, etc.) rather than the \\"hits\\" (ONCE IN A LIFETIME), but they're all keepers - I still think this was the Heads' true creative peak, although SPEAKING IN TONGUES ain't bad either, esp. NAIVE MELODY!  I wish WB would see fit to re-issued REMAIN LP with BONUS material - c'mon, there MUST be some deleted ENO/BYRNE masterpieces that didn't make the cut?  Pretty please with sugar on top?!  Until then, we have this. p.s. I remember rocking to the early pre-MTV videos with TONI BASIL \\"Pop-Locking\\" dance moves - KILLER!!
B0006399FS|3.0|After hearing the poppy yet rocking vertigo, i expected the rest of the album to be this way, but it isn't. it is a very mellow album, but it is good.   i keep hearing talk of how this album goes back to early u2, but i don't think it does.  i don't hear any of the politics, civil rights drive that made u2 stand out in overly commercialized 80's.   it is still a solid album, but not their best work. buy war instead.
B0002IQMKM|3.0|This is just another cash-in from WB on the Heads' back catalog - how can you call this \\"the best of\\" Talking Heads when it glaringly omits some of the BEST songs EVER, namely BORN UNDER PUNCHES and CROSSEYED AND PAINLESS from the bands' BEST album ever, REMAIN IN LIGHT?  Sure these weren't pop-radio friendly hits, but they are essential to the scope/understanding of the Heads' signature sound, exploration, and growth! This is more like a singles collection - so if you need that, fine by me, but I won't be getting this.  Nice cover, though.
B0002858YS|3.0|\\"Somebody Told Me\\" is the coolest gender bender song since Blur gave us the mind spinning \\"Boys and Girls.\\" Catchy and driving, it blows most of the current radio fodder out the window. I bought \\"Hot Fuss\\" pretty much on that basis alone, and have been cheered by the result. The Killers mix in the slick synthesized pop of the Cars with an 90's British New Wave sensibility (think Oasis and Blur). The full \\"Hot Fuss\\" record may be a bit uneven, but the most promising songs make me eager to see how the band develops.<br /><br />You get a jealous boyfriend who cops to murder in \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine.\\" You get a soulful chorus in \\"All These Things I've Done.\\" You get the head turning lyric in \\"Mr Brightside:\\"<br /><br />\\"Now they're going to bed<br /><br />and my stomach is sick<br /><br />And it's all in my head<br /><br />But she's touching his...chest\\"<br /><br />\\"Hot Fuss\\" is the sound of an energetic young band that has taken the time to absorb their influences rather than just strike a pose on them. The Killers, unlike most \\"strokes\\" (ha ha) of hype actually have the chops to make me want to believe the noise. This could be the best debut album of the year, along with Scissor Sisters.
B000002L80|3.0|As a true fans of the Heads since their inception, I bought every album up until this...LITTLE CREATURES...sure, I bought it like the rest, but this is one I don't play much anymore - why? It's clear from Byrne and Co's taste of success with BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE and others on early MTV, they all-but abandoned the brilliant exploration of REMAIN IN LIGHT to crossover onto MTV/Pop/Adult Contemporary playlists - sure, these songs may be \\"cute\\" and even a bit \\"clever,\\" but most now sound utterly too cloying for their own good - this is the sounds of the Heads losing their \\"funk\\" and gathering moss.  After this, all the albums just...plain...SUCKED.
B00005B36H|2.0|This is Tool just losing soul or melody in their music. <br /> <br />\\"Aenima\\" is light years ahead of this.
B00005JMUL|5.0|ok yes i am 14 and i am such a sucker for children movies. So i just had to drag my friend to see this. This movie was totally astounding. I actually felt tears streaming down my cheeks during some parts of the movies. When the two children are singing \\"when christmas comes to town\\" I actually felt chills on my neck and spine. It's just one of those movies that give you the good feeling. I would definatley see it 100 more times if i had to. It's just such a great movie I can't even put it all in words. I encourage anyone to see this movie it just brings back all those good young childhood memories.
B000002BBY|5.0|1. Oasis sound absolutley nothing like the beatles. <br />2. Even if they do a bit whats wrong with that, the beatles are a great band. <br />3. This album is one of the best, if not the best album of all time. <br />4. Oasis are the best band in the world. <br />5. Anyone who dislikes Oasis oviously does'nt know what a real music is very stupid. <br /> <br />Oasis are the only band that seem to have real attitude and passion for making music. Sure they #$@% up on a couple of albums but \\"heathen Chemistry\\" had  <br />Stop Crying Your Heart Out on. <br /> <br />Other great Oasis albums  \\"the Masterplan\\" \\"Definitley Maybe\\". <br /> <br />
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has an amazingly strong voice and on this cd she uses it to make some really beautiful songs. This album is a mix of some hiphop, r&b, pop, and even some rock (in fighter).Her last albums were all pop and didn't show her beautiful voice as much as this one.  1. Stripped intro  2. Can't hold us down 10/10  3. walk away 10/10- one of my favorite tracks  4. fighter 9/10  5. interlude  6. infatuation 10/10- also one of my favorite tracks  7. loves embrace interlude- nice intro to next song  8. loving me 4 me 9/10  9. impossible 8/10  10. underappreciated 7/10  11. beautiful 10/10  12. make over 9/10  13. cruz 7/10  14. soar 9/10- nice inspirational song  15. get mine get yours- 9/10  16. dirrty 10/10  17. stripped 2  18.

B000088E6D|5.0|Buble is the real thing. Can he ever sing and take a song to another level. <br /> <br />Having had the good fortune to see him also perform live in Australia and London know that he is for real. This fine cd is a testament to his talent. It's not any singer who can elevate the class of the material he or she sings, but Buble does on every song. <br /> <br />The most remarkable thing about Buble is his gift for making each song his own - take Summer Wind - while it may be a Sinatra Classic, Buble takes possession and 'kicks it up' - the same with Come fly with me and every other song.
B00005JMAH|3.0|So many things were out of character, and definitely out of pace with the previous movies. I understand that it strays from the book, the whole movie series has a life of its own and it has been great so far, leaving enough surprises to be found in the books for those who didn't get to read them first.  <br /> <br />Every character lacked identity for the first time in the series, which points NOT to bad acting, but to LOUSY direction. Dumbledore became the kind of school principal that everyone gets to hate too much instead of the wise old man he used to be, from his appearance, his lines, but most than anything his whole screen attitude. Same goes for professor McGonagall, and even Snape seemed less sinister and more fake than any other time.  <br /> <br />And off to the main characters, Alfonso Cuarn once again managed to try and \\"Imprint\\" His personal style thinking he is larger than Harry Potter and all of the magic that surrounds it, he added that grim quality which turns every single one of his movies into a \\"want to make art even if it spoils the movies\\", he gave Harry, Hermione, and Ron a \\"bitter\\" teenager quality that simply didn't fit. It was amazingly overdone and obviously he tried to hard, there are moments of brilliance among so many lousy embittered moments. Hermione lost her charm, Harry lost his cool and the feel he has in the books, and Ron came out as a completely \\"gray\\" character and Cuarn relied way too much in his \\"pouty\\" kind of performance, which in the previous films Columbus managed to make feel natural.  <br /> <br />Malfoy became just a cartoon in this movie, no opposition whatsoever and even his annoying nature came off out of character and fake.  <br /> <br />The story is really good even when Cuarn managed to make it a story with very little explanation which made it hard to follow at the start in his attempt to be \\"faster\\" in building suspense than Columbus did. Columbus is an artist and a magician in this sense, you don't need such hectic scenes to make a movie get off to a good start, Cuaron instead tried to give it a caotic and frantic kind of beginning which fell so very out of place.  <br /> <br />I'll buy the movie as well, since it's magically saved by the storyline, but it was a huge mistake to select this \\"wanna-be artist\\" director who is all the time trying to glofify himself at the cost of a very expensive, very awaited and very good movie.  <br /> <br />All in all it gets a 7 out of 10.
B00008ADPF|5.0|i dont know why theres a lot of bad reveiws this is a pretty damn good cd.  its production is out of this world and the songs are recorded very well, so why is everyone complaining?  i think this is a great effort from a band i didnt really like to begin with in the first place.  Silver Sides Up production wasnt that great but it had some good tunes.  if your a nickelback fan i recommend this cd but if you hate nu-metal or nu-rock then stay away.
B000286S8S|1.0|This release is typical of Van Halen releases, they give there fans nothing new. I guess they are saving up for the box set, For $20 you figured you'd get some unreleased tracks or rare photos, maybe some good vintage live cuts. What do you get? This is the best of Van Halen but without the guitar pick and with three new LACK LUSTER songs that sound like they were written in three minutes. And Artwork thats similar to bad grade school finger painting. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE VH CATALOG STAY AWAY FROM THIS. A WASTE OF MONEY...
B00006690H|5.0|great. my favorites are white america, buisness, cleanen out my closet, whitout me, square dance(feat. obie trice), sing for the moment, and a lot more. if u dont have this buy it immedietly.
B00005U11Z|5.0|This DVD is a must have!  All members of Journey are on top of their game..and this DVD proves it!  This band is hotter than ever!!  Steve Augeri is awesome!  Don't miss this DVD for your music collection!
B000023VR6|5.0|This is one of my best albums I own mainly because of the beats and music. Dre is one of the best in the game - he has dope lyrical flow, beats to die for and good subject matter. Some people would say that The Chronic was Dre's best album, it was really good but the beats on 2001 are 10 times better than the chronic but the lyrics only just surpass it. I recommend this album to anyone who considers themselves a hip hop fan and is sick of s**t 'ARTISTS' like Chingy and G-Unit.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|'Love Actually' is one of my favorite Christmas films, next to 'The National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. 'Love Actually' is a sometimes silly, romantic film where dozens (it seems like) of couples fall in and out of love.<br /><br />The film centers around people who are sometimes connected. Hugh Grant plays the Prime Minister of Britain, his sister, Emma Thompson married to a philandering jerk, Alan Ricker. The PM, Hugh Grant, is all alone, too busy for love until he meets an attractive food aide on his first day in office. Billy Bob Thorton, plays the President of the United States, who gets his comeuppance from the Britain's PM.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays a good friend of Emma Thompson, whose wife recently died, and he is the step father to such a cute young boy who is in love with a young exchange student from the US. Colin Firth finds his wife playing around with his brother, he goes abroad and meets a young woman who cleans and cooks for him. Neither speaks the other's language. And, then, the best part, Billy Mack, an older, much older musician played by Bill Nighy , looking for love in all the wrong places. Another young English man going to Wisconsin to meet some women, which he does. He could not find any women in the UK. So love is all around. There are some sad stories, you can find those. This is an uplifting film, that will bring smiles and a few tears.<br /><br />Happy Holdays. Recommended. prisrob 01-01-14
B00005JMAH|4.0|After two cloying, cutesy Chris Columbus sweets, the Harry Potter series has at last delivered for its fans on the promise of the books. <br /> <br />I guess it takes three tries to get it right. Finally a movie about a boy wizard that actually feels like it could be be happening in the real world, right under the noses of Muggle England. Finally a Potter movie that contains large doses of menace, mixed with teen angst and clever plotting that pays off in all ways. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed Potters 1 & 2, they felt so forced and so self-conscious under the weight of efforts to \\"get it right.\\" For examples of what I'm talking about, witness any scene with the Malfoy character. He's meant to be a foil to Potter and his friends, but he's little more than a cartoon character with expressions done about 5 levels beyond what's necessary. It's not that the actor is a poor actor so much as it's a director who doesn't trust his audience to follow the bread crumbs without telegraphing the message with enourmous cue cards. Columbus practically screams at the camera, \\"Malfoy is the bad kid!\\" with every preformance he forces out of the actor. <br /> <br />All it takes is seeing the same actor in \\"Azkaban\\" to see the difference. Given proper leadership, Malfoy has graduated from monotonous caricature to actual character. <br /> <br />Gone is Dobby, the Jar-Jar Binks of the second film. Gone are the over-the-top line readings doubled up with cutesy music cues from John Williams. In their place is a well-paced, clever film that captures the best the series has to offer without pandering to the slower members of the audience. <br /> <br />What's remarkable is how immediately the new direction of the series reveals itself. As with the first two movies, \\"Azkaban\\" begins with yet another unfortunate interaction between Harry and his obnoxious relatives. This time, the scenario plays out in a way that feels well-grounded, carrying gravity and yet with humor that is inherent in the scenario without being slapstick or shouted with a bullhorn. Same actors as the first two movies, but the volume on their performances has been turned down to excellent effect. <br /> <br />And so it goes, through a film that features the finest resolution of the three. It's almost impossible to say what's so great about the finale without giving away what makes it so fine. I'll just say that for me, I didn't have it figured out at all. Just when I thought we were back in the land of frustating dead ends or loose ends, we were actually in the hands of a clever director who didn't once tip his hand. Bucking the trend of almost every film series, this one is at its third installment and just keeps getting better. I can't wait for the fourth!
B000000OQF|4.0|You have to understand that when 'Appetite For Destruction' was released, the music at the time was alot of cheezy happy-go-lucky hairspray metal bands, eg, Cinderella, Bon Jovi, Poison, Motley Crue, etc. Guns N Roses were a little different then that. Their attitude was more confrontational, they led the debaucherous rock and roll lifestyle, and their music is more down and dirty. Guns N Roses weren't the first band to embody that attitude, but when you compare it to what the music scene was like in the mid to late 80's (alot of fluffy half-serious pop) it was such a huge contrast. Plus you have Slash's guitarwork, which is an interesting hybrid of classic rock and punk, a little different from the power-glam riffs and overproduced ballads by these metal bands, which became bland and boring after awhile. I think that's why 'Appetite For Destruction' continues to hold appeal, you can just sense the danger and confrontation. Alot of those 80's glam bands touched on themes like having fun, partying, girls, good times, etc. In contrast Guns N Roses painted a more darker picture, while at the sametime giving the world the finger, and it's probably this defiance and realism which still holds today. I had no idea Guns N Roses and 'Appetite For Destruction' would have this kind of shelf-life, but obviously something about them continues to resonate with people.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Dusty tapes... missing footage...  boxes of MTV 'B roll'...  Imbedded commercials...  Power outages...  Equipment failures...  From this (see the liner notes), we now have available over 600 minutes/4 DVDs of music and video of a cobbled-together, never-meant-to-be-recorded event that is possibly the most important concert since Woodstock.  And you know what?  Warts and all, it sounds and looks great!   <br /> <br />Of the two venues London and Philadelphia, the Wembley footage stands out.  I'm not sure if it's because of what the producers describe as the BBC's better-quality video and audio recordings or what was IMHO London's superior lineup and more animated audience -- probably a combination of the two.  But there are some really great musical and cultural moments.  Queen reigned and there can be no doubt as to why U2 is still great and why Adam Ant is... well...  retired :)  Remember Phil Collins' brilliant little stunt of playing both venues in the same day with a little help from two helicopters and the Concorde?  Captured.  And some of the presenters... what on earth was Chevy Chase wearing?!?  80s... fun. <br /> <br />Don't be put off by it being incomplete because of technical glitches or petty politics... For the great music, for the nostalgia, and for the historical value -- definitely a keeper.
0553296981|4.0|The Diary of Anne Frank is an interesting Holocaust book. It puts a different view on everything that they say about the holocaust. This young Jewish girl tells her story about leaving her home and going into hiding. This Diary tells about what Anne and her family do in the attic. How much she longs for the out doors and how much she misses all her friends. Anne seemed to have such a passion for the out doors and seemed like she was very out spoken and chatty. She writes about her family's close calls with the Nazi troops, her conflicts in life, thanks to the family and friends living in their close living quarters. Anne was a fantastic and inspirational writer for her age and to stay so happy and optimistic through the entire experience.<br /><br /> There was only one thing I didn't like about this book. It was that it tended to drag on. I like books that are fast pace and more upbeat. Not much can happen when you live in an attic so I understand that the diary would tend to drag on.<br /><br /> Honestly I really didn't want to read Anne Frank. It was a school assignment. But when I started getting into the book I realized that Anne's life was very interesting and exciting. I hated when the Nazi's found Anne's family and the VanDaan's after two long years in hiding and so close to making it alive. I wish Anne and her family didn't have to go through all the horrible things the Nazi's put them through. I encourage people to read this book. It puts a better understanding on how Jewish people had to spend there lives in hiding and always living I fear.  How there daily lives were in hiding and how the could barely move during the day.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I am currently viewing \\"Band...\\" for the second time and the anticipation for each segment gets higher and higher. Flawless acting...screenplay...the entire show is gripping and leaves you begging for more and more. Everyone should watch this to see what movies and TV could be like instead of the crap we are fed on a daily basis. Kudos to Speilberg and Hanks for creating what I feel is one of the best productions in the history of filmmaking.
B0001L3LUE|1.0|This guy was a lying rubber-stamping mouthpiece for one of the most despicable presidents and one of the most evil wars the U.S. has ever participated in.  Now in his old age he wants absolution by apologizing and saying he made honest mistakes.  There are millions of asians and 50,000+ U.S. soldiers now in their graves largely because of the behavior of this moron. Drunk with power, he intentionally, repeatedly, and knowingly lied to the American people for years.  He and Ollie North should both be tried for treason instead of travelling on the talk show circuit.
B000001EAQ|5.0|After exploring the roots of American rock and roll in late 1980s,  U2 turned their ears to emerging music trends from Europe--trip hop, industrial, and techno/rave.  The band then successfully assimilated those elements in its Euro-trilogy or Zooro-trilogy--Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and POP.  It is in POP, where U2 perfected the European sound.  (AB is a dark synthesis of the old U2 sound and the new.  Zooropa is plagued with some weak songwriting.)      12 songs gel into a song cycle.  It has some of band's best rockers, shockers(\\"Mofo\\") and ballads.  Lyrically, the song cycle searches for love, desire and faith in postmodern \\"desert of real\\" (to borrow a phrase from \\"The Matrix\\").  POP redeems these deep human values from our excess consumerism.     As the old saying goes, one's strength is also his weakness.  POP's futuristic sound and overt pop culture references proved to be its undoing.  The album did not do well commercially because American audience had too conservative a taste.  Local radio stations fed them on a strict diet of classic rock of Beatles, Stones, Eagles, Zeppelins.  \\"Discothque\\" would not get airplay along side of, say, \\"Hotel California.\\"  This is also the reason that U2's follow-up album, \\"All that you can't leave behind,\\" sold better.  ATYCLB is retro, 60s rock at its finest.     So go ahead and give POP a try if you feel adventurous(or simply tired of what your local DJs have been feeding you all those years).  You may be pleasantly surprised.
B0002MPU1K|4.0|I wrote glowingly of Peter Cincotti's freshman effort and hailed his promise as an artist. I liked ON The Moon but fear he may be going down the Harry Connick \\"road to nowhere\\" with this follow-up. Cincotti impressed me with his original compositions and unique take on the classics in his first CD. This effort is more uneven--he shines on the funky \\"St Louis BLues\\" and on \\"I Love Paris\\". He is very bland and non-descript on \\"Some Kind of Wonderful and \\" Up on the Roof\\". I enjoy his work but can't help but think Cincotti will rise or fall as an artist in a jazz trio/nightclub setting rather than as a Harry Connick wannabee.
B00064MW6A|2.0|I did not enjoy this film one bit, but I guess if unliek me you can be distracted from the plot by Halle Berry wearing tight leather, you will absolutly love it, but that never works for me.    The plot is about a woman who is killed, cats bring her back to life and she has new super powers.. just like any other Catwoamn story based on the Batman franchise, however this one does move away from that goofy un-realistic nature of Gothem City, and moves into New York, and even the villians are beleivable, but it still didnt intrest me with the lot about Catwoman who is becomign a self depended woman from her push over life before she died, and shes also out to get revenge on the person who killed her, who just happens to be doing something naughty!!    It's better then some of the Batman movies that have come out, and it does take on a more realistic approach to the Catwoman name and charactors. But I thats about all I have to say thats good about the film. and for those reasons alone is why I give it one more star then the lowest.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|the star wars trilogy was byfar the best trilogy I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!! all of the star wars movies were MIGH-TY FINE, and to the guy that said star wars was a LOTR rippoff, I can't see where you are going with your story, its nothing like LOTR, and I for one are one of those people you were talking about and as long as the star wars movies come out i'll help make Lucas richer!!
B0002MB7QW|1.0|I cant write a reveiw on what the plot was about other then the world freezes over and it shows what might happen, with people trying to act around it. <br /> <br />This movie is nothing but CGI overkill with no plot at around it except for a guy looking for his son. thats about all, oh and expect that romance crap around it that happens in every other movie. <br /> <br />This is another excuse to use SFX and CGI in a movie without bothering to concintrate on a story line around it, the CGI might look good, but you do not have a good movie based on that alone, when are these people going to learn that CGI do not carry a movie?
B00006SFLV|5.0|I remember watching this show when I was like 8. I didnt really get the shoe, and I dont even think it mattered to me. All I knew was that her name was Angela. I was so upset when the MSCL got cancelled. But years later I got into Degrassi. And I was so stoked to find out that MSCL would be coming on The-N. I love this show so much. Each episode is awesome. Angela is so deep. everything in her life affects the way I view situations in my like. definately the BEST SHOW EVER!!!
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|&#65279;This is a story of a son's reconciliation with his father.  The plot device of using the fantastic<br /><br />tales of the father to illustrate the son's frustration with his father is well done.  I have a personal dislike for the use of freakish characters such as giants but this was actually well carried out with a Fellini-esque flair.  The acting and interrelation between<br /><br />characters were flawless.  Overall a good film that provides a heart-warming insight into human<br /><br />foibles.
0385513755|5.0|This book is amazing. All of his books are amazing. I read Da Vinci code within 24 hours and then had to buy all of his other books. Dan Brown spins a fantastic yarn everytime.<br /><br />For those who found fault with minor errors or claim it is an attack on Christianity - hello - it is a work of FICTION, albeit set in the modern day world.<br /><br />Even without the illustrated version I could picture it all in my head (although I now plan to get a copy of the illustrated version as well.<br /><br />Cant rate this high enough. Of his other books Angels and Demons would be my next favourite
B0002F6BRE|2.0|You know that feeling you get when you're 10 years old, it's Christmas eve and you're tucked up in your bed all nice and snug...that's the feeling you get when you watch this movie.
B0006399FS|2.0|If U2 is the best that rock has to offer these days, rock must be dead.  The band that gave us \\"Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby,\\" are surely dead.  This album pushes no new boundries and wallows in mediocrity.  A band that usually pushes the envelope of musical technique, continually re-inventing itself, into something of interest for its fans, has finally hit rock bottom.  Bono and lads, please retire before you start looking like the fat Elvis.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|The visuals in this film are incredible, and yes, content wise it more of the same ideas presented in the first film.  I don't have anything to add to the previous reviews except that I take issue with the \\"violence against women\\" warning in the film's rating.  As far as I can recall from my viewing of the movie, no female characters came to any harm except \\"female\\" cyborgs who were on a killing spree and were put down in combat.  The warning seems to imply that female characters are shown being brutalized in the film. While the cyborgs' state of sexual slavery (never explicitly shown) is central to the plot, the overall theme has more to do with issues of what comprises humanity. The warning unfaily implies that the film has a misogynistic overtone.
0743506650|5.0|I listened to this wonderful audio cd as I drove across the usa over the summer. I'm very interested in learning to write. I picked up a lot of great ideas and tips but most of all I LOVED getting to know Stephen King. He is a very down to earth guy with a different way of looking at the world. I admire and respect him as a person and felt horrible to learn of his unfortunate accident. I recommend this book to people who really want to learn about writing from an intelligent yet humble, sweet guy.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|It's cold and grey outside. My roommate only has two dvd's: The Butterfly Effect and The Cat in The Hat. Being an avid Kutcher hater, I decided to watch The Cat. The disc was scratched. Suddenly my whole world was transformed. No. Not really. I'm lame. It's just that this was the first good movie I have seen in a long while. I must have paused the film two or three times to voice my surprise at anyone who happened to wander into my dorm. Really, if you like Donnie Darko, Jacobs Ladder, The Outer Limits or any other well-made sci-fi infused, psychological drama then I promise you will enjoy this movie. If I am wrong then you are Bruce Willis. p.s. After watching the film I felt an inexplicable need to write this. Weird huh?
B0002VL0KQ|1.0|Wow. This has to be one of the worst things I've heard in my life. Celine, having a baby doesn't give you the right to put out this ungodly BS. Every song on this is boring and simple.  New moms might get a kick out of this but thats all, and I guess that is the point.
B0006399FS|3.0|Let me start by saying I have been a U2 fan since their 1981 tour. I own every disc. I've seen every tour since. With every CD they've released, it has taken time to fully appreciate it. That is one of the reasons their music is timeless, and why they are one of the greatest bands in music history. Some CD's are better than others, of course. Who can remember when they last listened to \\"Pop\\"? HTDAAB demonstrates a mature band, looking back on what they've done, and looking ahead to what more they  might yet do. I would predict that HTDAAB will not prove to be one of their classics, but it is still enjoyable. Best song, by far, for me is City of Blinding Lights. Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, and Vertigo will also be played on future CD tours. A few other songs I expect will grow, such as Love and Peace or Else, Crumbs From Your Table, Yahweh, and A Man and a Woman. A few others might end up forgotten. If you're not sure whether to buy this CD, then you're not likely a lifelong U2 fan, in which case this CD might not grow on you. If you are a lifelong fan, what are you doing reading this? Buy it!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This movie is utterly amazing. Before watching it, I must say that I was skeptical, mostly because I hate thrillers and I didnt think Ashton Kutcher would ever be capable of nailing a serious role. Not only am I a converted thriller-lover, Ashton greatly exceeded my expectations. This movie is a wonderful thriller where in the first five minutes, you are already intruiged and fond of some characters and hateful of others. I would definately reccomend this movie for anyone over 13, and maybe some mature preteens. This movie relays certain messages and elements that anyone under 12/13 may not understand; meaning they wouldnt be able to fully appreciate this movie. <br /> <br />I definately reccomend it. This is one of my favorites.
B00005QDW5|5.0|IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE<br />It's finally here!!! A complete and actual real greatest hits<br />package from the Pinks themselves. Hearing Astonomy Domine followed by See Emily Play in its newly remastered digital<br />excellence is worth the price alone. Also worth mentioning is the inclusion of When The Tigers Broke Free. Until now never on CD. The CD comes packaged in a slip case and includes a very nice book of lyrics and art work. This is one not to miss.
B00026W82U|5.0|this cd is a masterpiece like the first one,neither is greater than the other.Id rather dance with you is one very catchy song very good and the others songs are extremely good the best cd of 2004 period.
0793518326|5.0|OK, This is not a perfect translation of the best pop songs ever written. It is however pretty damn close. There are small micro details missed and some typo's. Other than those tiny problems, this book is damn near perfect. Remeber when we were young pups learning to play guitar? Those lame Beatle music books had all the wrong chords so trying to play along with the records was futile . This book corrects that problem and tries to teach us the correct way to play these songs. Best tab job I've ever seen.<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK, PLAY ALONG, YEAH YEAH YEAH
B000002INR|5.0|It's funny that an album released at the end of the \\"hair metal\\" era, would eventually become one of the greatest albums of the genre.  Released in 1989, Skid Row's self titled album is amazing from start to finish.  Opening with the song that gets my vote for the best cut off the album, Big Guns is skid rows way of showing their admiration for thier favorite part of the female anatomy.  From there album runs like a perfectly constructed mix tape.  The songs build up in intesity through Sweet Little Sister, can't stand the heartache, and piece of me, before cooling off with their first single 18 and life.  After that the process starts over again, highlighted by their \\"we're not going to take it anthem\\" Youth Gone wild, and capping with I remember you and Midnight/Tornado. <br />Aside from being great metal song writers, these guys were amazing musicians.  Snake Sabo is a very underated guitar player, his solo on Here I am should be learned by any aspiring rock guitar player.  The real gem of this band, of course, is Sebastian Bach.  Or more fittingly, Sebastian Bach's voice.  This man possesed one of the most powerful, and wide ranged voices in the history of music.  The high note that he hits at the end of I remember you is mindblowing.  <br />It's too bad these guys couldn't keep it together.  They had amazing talent, and great songs. <br />If you need a boost to your CD collection, and want an album of solid rock and roll tunes, buy the album, you wont be dissapointed.
B00005JNDX|5.0|Don't pay any attention to the negative reviews. This is an excellent feel good movie! Go see it. You will not be disappointed. I have seen it 3 times and enjoyed it more with subsequent viewings. My husband who hates chick flicks also loved it. The audience laughed and cheered throughout the movie and everyone left the film with a smile on their faces. How many movies do that? <br /> <br />I read the book and I personally think that the film is orders of magnitude better. The story is tighter, with much less of Bridget's friends and mother (thank God!). The acting is first rate: Renee IS Bridget, Hugh Grant is at his sleazy best and what to say about Colin Firth - fabulous! Firth delivers an amazing spot-on performance which really exposes Darcy's difficulties dealing with emotions and how he eventually manages to get past them to fight for the woman he loves. My only quibble is that Colin Firth could have had more screen time. He did however, have more time than in the first film. (I am biased, being a huge fan.) <br /> <br />If you want to be entertained and emerge from the theater with a smile on your face, just go see it. Nobody does romantic comedies better than the British!
B00006AW2L|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the greatest  Stones album The Rolling Stones ever put out. Yes, the sound is terrible. And SACD did a terrible job at remastering this, but its all about the music. And with such good music as this, you tend to forget about the terrible sound.  <br /> <br />I prefer the Brian Jones period in The Stones, (1964-1969) and out of all those albums with Jones on board, this one stands out the most. <br /> <br />It opens with their classic, Paint It Black. There are rumors, The Stones were the first to use the sitar on rock and roll recordings. But I think The Beatles actually did it first. But I could be wrong.... <br /> <br />Under My Thumb is one of the tightest songs, The Stones ever put out. And let's not forget about the non-hits. Stupid Girl is great! Flight 505, High And Dry, Lady Jane, and the longest rock song at the time, I'm Going Home.  <br /> <br />This is a great album. The Stones were a good band, until they turned into a pop/rock band, in the 70's and 80's. This features them in their prime. The time period when they put out good records!
0783116934|4.0|The body of a murdered child is found after a year in an unmarked grave and brought to a forensic scientist. He orders the officers to return to the forest where the body was found to search for clues. The officers return with the bodies of seven more children. The scientist concludes that there is a serial killer on the loose and tells his superiors that they must assign more men to the case and that the public has to be warned. But this does not happen and the scientist is told that he is mistaken because the Soviet Union does not have serial killers. Only the decadent nations of the West have such madmen.<br /><br />\\"Citizen X\\" is the compelling true story of most prolific documented serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn), the \\"Rostov Ripper,\\" who was eventually convicted of the murders of 52 people, most of whom were children under the age of 17. Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea) is the second lieutenant from the criminology laboratory who is put in charge of the case by Col. Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland in an Emmy winning performance). Burakov knows what has to be done, but it thwarted at almost every turn, usually by Bondarchuck (Joss Ackland), a stereotypical Communist stooge, but also by Gorbunov (John Wood), whose ego has him thinking that he knows better than everybody else. Burakov wants more men and more computers, but that would be sending a message up the food chain that they cannot handle the problem. He wants to contact the foremost experts on serial killers at the F.B.I.'s office at Quantico, but he is denied permission. He tries to enlist the aid of psychiatrists in profiling the killer, and only one, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky (Max von Sydow), is willing and it is he who studies the evidence and puts together a report on Citizen X.<br /><br />The tragic irony of \\"Citizen X\\" is that the ineptitude of the Soviet bureaucracy plays as much of a role in setting the record as does Chikatilo's perversions. Chikatilo mutilates his victims, and while we are spared much of the gruesome details and sights, even those monstrous acts seem to pale when compared to the systemic indifference of the Soviet bureaucracy. With Burakov that have the right man in the right place, but they handicap him with orders to arrest homosexuals and coercing confessions out of a scapegoat. Even worse, almost from the start Burakov knows from questioning the families of the victims that the killer picks up his victims at railway stations. He crosses paths with the killer, but although he knows where to look, he does not know much about who or what he is looking for.<br /><br />But Burakov is devoted to hunt. One of the best moments in the film is when he learns that he is venerated by the very men at Quantico that he is forbidden to contact. They consider him to be \\"an intelligent, methodical, painstakingly, passionate detective who would rather die than give up.\\" He is, literally, the one man they would not want pursuing them. He has won the allegiance of the cynical officers in his unit, and the respect of Col. Fetisov, who uses blackmail to protect the investigation and tries to teach Burakov the nuances of manipulating the bureaucracy. Meanwhile, Burakov inspires Fetisov to start acting like a human being once again and the day comes when \\"Peristroika\\" finally unshackles Burakov from the crippling restrictions he has endured for so long. Now, he has the manpower and the means, and all he needs is a final, fresh victim, a grim thought that has driven Burakov to tears on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Directed and written for the screen by Chris Gerolmo, from the book \\"The Killer Department: by Robert Cullen, \\"Citizen X\\" works well on the small screen, which is better suited to a manhunt that lasts about two decades. Gerolmo has made the story less about procedure and more about the personalities. After all, there are years where little happens in this case, and it is only Burakov's dedication that provides the sense of continuity. This is a made for cable move that starts and finishes strong, with the growing horror over not only the killings but the bureaucracy's indifference to the crimes early on and the pivotal scene at the end when the murderer is finally all alone in a room with the one man who can break him.cable move that starts and finishes strong, with the growing horror over not only the killings but the bureaucracy's indifference to the crimes early on and the pivotal scene at the end when the murderer is finally all alone in a room with the one man who can break him.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album is great. This is the second day i have listened to it and i think it is there best album since Achtung baby. The music in this album gives me the old rattle and hum feel especially the \\" Love and Peace or Else\\" track. Very rattle and humish. I compare the vocal melodies in this album to Achtung baby. I am so relieved that this is not a poppy album like the other that brought in many mindless U2 fans. dont get me wrong the album was catchy and had some good songs on it, but it was made for the radio. I will be suprised if there are many singles off of this album. The poppiest song being \\"vertigo\\" wich i still love. This is an album that Can only be appreciated by someone with a good ear for U2. I have read some reviews on here giving this album only one star!!!!!!!!!!!. I am so curious to know what else those people have in there music collection? Creed? Linkin Park? Eminem? Jay Z. If you are a musician and or a big U2 fan this album will be one of their best. And i will leave everyone with this little phrase i have come to believe in. If you get a song the first time you play it its not worth listening to again.! PEOPLE TURN OFF MTV AND THE RADIO AND GIVE THIS A CHANCE
0375756728|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.k it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

B00063EMJ6|5.0|So anyway, Neil Young's Greatest Hits, it is, and it just sounds wonderful. The songs are all fairly obvious choices, even if NY's not really been a hits kinda guy (I always thought his greatest hit was right before he went on stage at The Band's Last Waltz [I crack myself up sometimes]). If you have DECADE you have most of them already. But if you have Decade (or any other NY CDs), you've not really heard these songs like this. They've all been remastered wonderfully.<br /><br />On the negative side, this is a one CD compilation, so there are some glaring omissions. First off, the Greatest Hits makes it look like NY stopped writing songs in 1992, and though many people probably haven't heard much of his music in the last decade, he's still put out some very good stuff.<br /><br />If I'd've had my way I would have had him keep \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" off, which would have allowed him to put the wonderful \\"Razor Love\\" on (from 1999's Silver & Gold), with room left for one or two more tracks. Possibly the title track to the movie Philadelphia, or \\"Bandit\\" from his latest album, Greendale. Oh well, I guess that's why we all have burners now, isn't it?
1577311523|5.0|If you \\"think\\" this was a bad book or a great book.  You have totally missed the point.  We are hanging on to these ideas and concepts of what a good book should be or what a bad book is not.  Instead of just letting it be. <br /> <br />This is my first time writing a review for any book.  I found this book very helpful in my spiritual quest.  I have been reading different religious texts; Bible, Koran, Buddhist texts, Taoist believes.  When you get down to the essences of these religions, they are one and the same.  The split comes when our mind starts picking out their differences.  Comparing and contrasting, dissecting to prove each other wrong. <br /> <br />Well, it turns out we are all right, and we are all wrong.  When you hold on to some concept and strongly defends it physically and mentally, and willing to kill someone over it.  Wouldn't you say that's wrong? <br /> <br />Once you realize this, you are one step closer to Enlightenment and be free from suffering. <br /> <br />I also found literature at [...] very helpful.  Don't pre-judge, just go check it out for yourself.  The door is closed to those who refuse to open it.
B0001KU93C|5.0|I think most people who don't care much for this movie had been spoiled by Leone before watching it.  I mean, Leone really set the bar high for westerns and I don't think anyone has done it as good since.  He pretty much reinvented the western and set the rules.  Italian directors who followed in his wake were directors who usually did other kinds of films, but started doing westerns coz they were big bucks at the box office.  Django was the first of the non-Leone spaghetti westerns, and it's a great movie.  Sure, the budget shows and the acting isn't always the best, but I'm able to look past that.  The look of the film is unique-Instead of the blazing hot deserts, most of this film is cloudy and muddy(I know it was shot in winter and I think it takes place in winter as well), giving it it's own look.  Franco Nero is no Eastwood or Bronson, but he has the right stuff for the part and pulls it off nicely.  Very violent for 1966, but we've become so desensitized over the years that it won't have you gasping in shock.  It's still brutal enough though.  Lots of complaints about the soundtrack again.  Well, once again this isn't Leone, therefore the epic music isn't here either.  But I don't see how you can hear the theme song and not laugh.  You can just see Tom Jones singing this to a crowd of screaming women in Vegas.  Once again Blue Underground has given another forgotten film the best possible treatment it can have.  They give us an interview with Franco Nero and a very interesting short film with Nero as well.  And as always, Blue Underground gives us the original poster as the cover(I love how they do that with these old flicks!).  If you have any interest at all in westerns and have seen the Dollars trilogy too many times, you can't go wrong with Django-that is if you lower your expectations a tad.
B0000000LI|4.0|Honestly, I don't see anything wrong with loving this CD.  Any CD will show its flaws if you listen to it carefully enough, but thats not the point.  The point is to enjoy the music for what it is, not what you think it should be.  If you dont like it, fine, but dont criticize those that do.   <br />That said, I love this CD.  I dont care how repetitious parts of it get, or how \\"simple\\" it is, it just sounds fantastic to me. Santorini is my favorite, followed by rain must fall, but this is honestly good stuff.   Its very soothing and calming after a hard days work or college.  Yanni isnt the most talented composer (listen to the Disney Millenium celebration CD for something truly great) but he has his place in neoclassical music, and he does have millions of fans worldwide, so he deserves some respect, even if you hate his music. The quality of this CD is great, and if you are a fan of this genre of music, I think you'll love this CD. <br />
B000667GFK|5.0|This is by far one of the best spanish cd's I have heard in a very long time. The entire cd is flawless. The only drawback is that it feels a little to short. Other than that it is a complete success. Luis Miguel is by far one of the best artist among them all in any language. It is very difficult to find a performer that keeps outdoing himself each time. absolutely excellent. very highly recommended.
B0006399FS|4.0|This band is really setting a precedent for bands that follow behind. To continue writing amazing music that is commerically viable while maintaining their dignity and always exploring, analyzing, and evolving their craft. This disc is an amazing example of true artistic merit and great emotional strength. While some songs are not as good as others the good far outnumber the bad on this album. Bono has the gift of writing lyrics that are both personal yet able to be interpreted by the listener to pertain to themselves in some way. This is the greatest gift somebody that writes lyrics that are confessional in anyway could have. Also the band itself has never been stronger sounding and The Edge seems to have really given himself room to breathe on this album with plenty of places for some of his amazing guitar playing unlike some of their previous records. Too bad other bands can't create music like this after they've been around for awhile, if that were the case we might not be in the short attention span MTV generation that I'm sadly a part of. Keep up the good work guys.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is about as depressing as it gets. Every other scene shows the characters (played by excellent actors who show the most visceral emotions) slipping a notch further into dispair, sorrow, anguish, and basically, hell. The cinematic effects used emplasize the repetition of the habits that cause the characters downward spirals. The music repeats themes for much the same effect, and has parts that are painfull to listen to, creating an atmosphere that completes the sensory experience. The Krnos quartet performs remarkably, and the original score fits the movie perfectly. I would recommend renting the movie, unless you enjoy being depressed after watching a movie that drains any hope or leftover happiness. Be careful who you watch this movie with.
B00008ADPF|1.0|Okay, if you want to crucify me, then go ahead; I thought The State was a great rock album without any real pomp and pageantry. <br /> <br />That aside, Silver Side Up was a slightly more matured album other than the hits that were plastered all over MTV and every radio station regardless of genre. Release a B-sides kind of album of earlier work with SSU and fast forward a few years. The band's kicking around with nothing to do and the record label walks in like a parent and says \\"if you're not doing anything, I have some chores for you boys to do\\"  <br /> <br />Produce and promote it and we're left with one or two almost decent songs if you have the bonus tracks. Other than that, we have nothing but a genereic garbage CD from what used to be a good barebones rock band. I have a serious problem with this CD when almost (if not all, I refused to check through) of the songs have a verse structure of 'A' - 'B' and 'A' again with more growling to make it sound different. I still can't figure out if I'm more annoyed by rock bands repeating verses or pop/club hip-hop artist making up new words and new accents for lack of real creativity.  <br /> <br />If you want some good Nickleback, get The State. Otherwise, stop listening to most of what's put on the radio. More often than not, if it's generic enough to appeal to an audience even as large as a radio station fan base (don't get me started on TV), then it's too plain to contain any real substance.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's lead vocalist Chris Martin once mentioned in a magazine interview (I dont know which) that they make their music as a substitute for all the \\"soulless crap\\" in the industry today. (Not his exact words, though). And though they don't stand out exceptionally in the music scene (due to the media bias to other music forms), they are undoubtedly one of the best acts out there today. The reason lies in that almost-melancholy, touching-yet-not-mindlessly-mushy element in their songs. In short, they do their music extremely well. And they didn't need eyesore ostentation in presentation as shown by the understated design of the CD. <br /> <br />All the songs in their album are great, but if I had to mention the best ones I'd personally recommend \\"In My Place\\" (it's such a great song! It's the new \\"Yellow\\"), \\"The Scientist\\" (Definitely one of their best), \\"Warning Sign\\" (who can't love those lyrics?), the title track \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" (Powerful), and the last song \\"Amsterdam\\" (one of the best finales to an album I've ever heard). <br /> <br />The best part is these guys' hearts are in the right place. Just check out the websites listed in the CD inlay and you'll know right away that these guys are all but clueless to what's happening to this world.
B00004YB9Y|5.0|Although several labels already had Christmas albums of the three tenors in their catalogue, the three maestros never actually trioed on these releases. When Plcido Domingo and the \\"Christmas in Vienna\\" team started preparing the eighth concert in the series (six predecessors were captured by Sony, and one, titled \\"Celebration of Christmas\\" issued by Erato-Warner), they made a monumental decision: Re-uniting three of the greatest voices of the current music business. <br />For one and a half hour, Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti performed the greatest Christmas songs and carols from around the world. Nearly 65 minutes of this monumental concert are captured on this disk. The opening version of \\"O Holy Night\\" (aka \\"Cantique De Noel\\", \\"Minuit, Chrtien\\") by Domingo and Pavarotti would be reason enough to get this one. But wait, there is far more on the way, than selections from the classical genre. The real enjoyment starts, when the three tenors do one of the most romantic arrangements of Irving Berlin's \\"White Christmas\\" ever heard and fade from a rousing \\"La Virgen Lava Pa`nales\\" into one of the finest treatments of \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" ever heard. Also of great interest is the trio arrangement of \\"Let It Snow!\\", which is included on some of the import versions and on the DVD. <br />If you are a hopeless completist like me, you may be asking, what happened to the 25 minutes cut from the CD release. Well, first let me say, that none of the currently available releases has the order of the songs as they were performed in the concert. Although this is a live recording, handclaps and other characteristics of a live recording are hardly audible on the CD version. Two tracks, \\"Jingle Bells\\" and \\"Let It Snow\\", which had clearly audible handclaps at the beginning and at the end of the performance (and therefore couldn't be faded out) can be found on the mentioned import disk and on the DVD's PCM soundtrack. \\"Children of Christmas\\" (a Plcido Domingo Jr. composition originally introduced in \\"Christmas In Vienna IV\\" by Plcido Domingo and Michael Bolton) and \\"Ay\\" Para Navidad\\" can be found exclusively on the DVD. Currently unavailable on any official release is the \\"Overture\\" (which can be found on the DVD, but abridged with sound effects). So here's the actual running order: \\"Overture\\", 20, 2, 1, 11, 3, 4, \\"Children of Christmas\\", 16, 17, 6, 15, 8, \\"Let it snow\\", 5, \\"Ay! Para Navidad\\", 9, 19, 14, 18, 12, 13, \\"Jingle Bells\\", 7, 21, 10; <br />If you still doubt about the quality of this performance, let me say one for sure: As other volumes in the series will slowly disappear (as some of them have already in the US), this one is a matter of decades and when you buy this one, you will have joyful Christmas hours for many, many Christmases to come.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|I've bought every Parsons album, and I've enjoyed *most* of them. Like many fans, I pine for the greatness of I Robot and Tales and settle for albums satisfy--but don't achieve greatness. <br /> <br />This album doesn't fit into that lineage. It's from left field. Alan's son plays a bit on the album, and I can't help but wonder if he had a tremendous influence (beyond the number of sounds that he happened to put on the album). If so, methinks the son is a fan of electronic dance music. <br /> <br />Yes, this is an Electronica Parsons album. Quite odd. And wonderfully enjoyable. Fans of Todd Rundgren (are there any other Parsons/Rundgren fans out there?) have often enjoyed hearing their favorite artist play around with new genres. Its about time that Parsons poked and prodded Electronica. <br /> <br />The result? Quite enjoyable, for the most part. And definitely something new. It's music you can crank up on your car stereo on a Saturday night while cruising and not get laughed at by hipsters. They'd shoot you a confused--but curious glance...though only if you had the nerve to turn the stereo that high.
B00005JMJG|4.0|There is much to recommend the movie. The plot is simple: boy meets girl. How the movie tells the story is complicated. The plot line folds in on itself. It reveals bits and pieces of the relationship slowly and sometimes you have to put a piece somewhere else than where you originally placed it in the jigsaw puzzle of their relationship. This makes the movie interesting to watch. In this respect it is like \\"Memento.\\" Carey and the other actors do a good job. Carey plays a lonely loner in this movie very well.  <br /> <br />The plot device is the memory erase. A doctor comes up with a method to erase all memories of a relationship. What the movie points out very well,using Carey's relationships and subplots, is that memories of even bad relationships should be valued and erasing memories does not really solve any thing in your life.  <br /> <br />I did not give the movie five stars because I was not engaged in the relationship. There is an emotional center in the movie, but it really did not interest me. I could care less whether Carey's character and Winslett's character have a successful relationship. Maybe it is just me, but you see much of the bad parts of the relationship before you see the good so it is hard to be a cheerleader for this relationship to work.  <br /> <br />I recommend the movie; however, it did not overwhelm me. Maybe I expected too much, because I liked the director's other works so much.
B0002OERI0|5.0|When speaking of music, people generally do not understand when I distill the terminology to simply, rock & roll. American Idiot is great rock & roll.  Monikers developed in the last 40+ years describing genres beyond basic rock & roll matter not.  When you hear great rock & roll there's just no denying it.  Dissecting the work, suggesting some songs are \\"A\\"s while others are \\"B\\"s miss the point of a work in it's entirety.  The music and lyrics on this CD merge into a consummate whole.  American Idiot, as such, deserves a grammy nod (IMHO).  I have been waiting since 1967 for Brian Wilson's epic opus; SMiLE.  American Idiot overshadows that other incredible 2004 release for me (blasphemy even in my own mind but A.I. rocks . . .) JV
B0006213H6|2.0|It's a mediocre album, and very different from Agaetis Byrjun and  \\"( )\\". I think it's safely my third favorite of the three I mentioned.     I'm probably not the most die-hard fan, but I am familiar with all of the biographical info that most of the previous reviewers seem to know.       If you are wondering whether the album is a worthwhile listen/purchase, I think the answer is \\"maybe\\", assuming that you enjoy ethereal music, and it helps to be familiar with their later releases. Some of the tracks seem like nothing more than Halloween sound effects. I give it about 2.5 stars. I prefer to recommend some songs by the Cocteau Twins, like \\"Blind Dumb Deaf\\". You should really listen to this album before you buy it,because it might disappoint you. Stick to \\"( )\\" Or \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\".
B0001WTVUW|5.0|You'll be blown away by Nicholas Meyer's \\"The Day After\\". A movie about what COULD HAVE HAPPENED during the peak years of \\"The Cold War\\". The town of Lawrence, Kansas and its suburbs are destroyed by a devastating nuclear war with Russia. Great special effects!
0140277447|1.0|The beijing authorities view anti-Japanese sentiment as something to orchestrate primarily for its own international purposes to strengthen war guilt among Japanese and opposition to Japanese rearmament among the nations of the world. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, China's Communist Party shows no concern with any moral accounting for the atrocities that it perpetrated against its own people during the long years of mass imprisonment, labor camp, the politically induced famine of the early 1960's, or, for that matter, the massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen. <br /> <br />-- Richard Bernstein and Ross H.

B0006FO9J2|5.0|First off this DVD isnt 46 dollars, clearly there is some mistake. The Early Days takes a look at the beginnings of Iron Maiden and is loaded with early footage such as Live at Dortmund, Live at The Rainbow, and others. This DVD is great because it features the band fronted by Paul Di'Anno and then the introduction to the Bruce Dickinson era. It is an awesome DVD and is a must have for any Maiden fan.
B0006399FS|4.0|After reading some of the reviews here I had to add my own. So hopefully this helps you decide. I have been a huge u2 fan ever since I watched their video for \\"I will follow\\" on MTV and thought , wow, this is some good music. Now 25 years later I think they still are the best rock band around. But I have to admit I don't think this is the best album they have ever made.  Have you ever had to listen to an album more than once to like it? Well that is how I kinda feel after listening to it. I think that Vertigo is so much more upbeat than all the other songs that it didn't set the right tone of the album being the first song. Not sure where it would belong but it clearly is the best song on the album.  I have to say though I do like the album and would recommend it but don't expect it to be as good as the their last album \\"All You Can't Leave Behind\\".  I live in nyc and saw them live before 9-11 and right afterword on Oct 24, and have to say they had such a huge effect on me that night (words can't even explain the emotions going on) that I was really looking forward to this album. I am not disappointed but I have to say I would have liked some more upbeat songs. I did give it a 4 out of 5 so obvioulsy i like it enough to give it a good revier. Thank you for your time and again hopefully this helps you.
B0006399FS|5.0|Although people say that this album isn't better than Achtung Baby, it's just as good on a different level.  It's not exacly ground breaking or redefining, but it's absolutely amazing.  It doesn't exceed any expectations, but it meets the expectation of what U2 should be.  Every song on this album is great.  Just sit down, turn the volume way up and read the lyrics with the music.  This album redeems U2 for zooropa and pop, which could have been a great album if produced differently.
0743490304|4.0|Having already read the the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I was looking forward to Deception Point.  It's a good book, one you won't want to put down, and there are twists and turns all over the place.  Unfortunately, Brown gets a bit predictable as an author.  It's not that you know who the bad guy is going to be, it's that you KNOW the good guys are going to narrowly (and often ingeniously or just plain miraculously) escape death a few times, that at the end the guy is gonna get the girl, etc.  But, in spite of this, the book is quite good, and does manage to suck you in.  Just don't be surprised when some of the things that happened in Code and Angels seem to be happening all over again in Deception Point.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw is extremely talented. You can hear and see his soul on this cd. His vocal and instrumental talent make this one of the best cds i've ever bought. His smooth voice and true to life lyrics are great!
0553565915|3.0|Most people who read this book have it handed to them after the death of a loved one.  For me it was my wife's father.  She read it and found it to be a great comfort and she wanted me to read it too.  I was skeptical but for her sake, I read it.  I am a slow reader but this thing is so full of fluff I got through it in just over two hours.  Religion is a great comfort to people in times of personal grief and I realize this book has helped many people to cope with death.  But religion is also one of the few career fields, along with politics, where you can turn bull---- into money.  It is plainly obvious that this whole thing is made up.<br /><br />She never says why she was in the hospital.  What caused her near-death experience?  Explaining this might have given the story a little more credibility, but for the author, none of this was relevant.  The only reason for writing the book was to tell the miracle story.  Most NDEs last only a few minutes.  This one was long enough for a feature-length film, and she seems to have total recall of every little detail.  How could she have survived such a lengthy near-death experience?  She crammed a lot of material into the four or five minutes that a person can survive such an ordeal.<br /><br />Pardon me for being skeptical of a book that clearly has helped so many people in their darkest hour.  Maybe the author is sincerely trying to use her writing skills to help people cope with death.  But on the other hand, if there is a heaven and if she is trying to cash in on the grief of others, she'll need more than a good line of bull---- when she meets her maker for real.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is an amazingly well done film. The actors are amazing, the story is great and the feel of the film is excellent. You become trapped in the story of the young lovers extremely fast. This is not a movie where you can just get up and go to the kitchen for food, everything is important. Almost every second of this movie is important to the film. I know if you appreciate any type of art, this movie will blow your mind. See what you think. (Does anyone know why in the credits is says: 'The Voice of the Queen Fairy: Ozzy Osbourne?')
B0006284JQ|5.0|Hi! im from New zealand and honestly, you Americans give these CDS bad reviews cause they dont contain some of the stuff we get on the other side of the world.<br /><br />You guys get CD's WAY cheaper than us, but miss out on a few things like on Britney's \\"IN THE ZONE\\" album, it contained 3 extra tracks. On this Greatest hits, which is still great anyway, we get 20 tracks in total and you guys get 17 tracks. We can get either the normal version with no bonus CD w/ remixes or the Special edition w/ bonus cd with the remixes.<br /><br />Anyway this is still a great bunch of 17 tracks, if you can get the imported \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (Bonus CD)\\" its  $32.99 but its pretty worth it.  We have to pay $29.99 for these CDs in New Zealand!, I got this for $22.99 , pretty cool!.<br /><br />But hey you guys get em cheaper!<br /><br />Here is my 1 (Crap) to 5 (great) review on all the songs on here.<br /><br />1. My Prerogative  (4)<br /><br />2. Toxic  (4.5)<br /><br />3. I'm A Slave 4 U  (5)<br /><br />4. Oops! I Did It Again  (5)<br /><br />5. Me Against The Music (Ft Madonna) (4)<br /><br />6. Stronger  (5)<br /><br />7. Everytime  (5+)<br /><br />8. Baby One More Time  (5+)<br /><br />9. (You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop Remix)  (5)<br /><br />10. Boys (Co-Ed Remix Ft Pharrell Williams Of N.E.R.D.) (3)  11. Sometimes  (3.5)<br /><br />12. Overprotected  (4)<br /><br />13. Lucky  (5)<br /><br />14. Outrageous  (4.5)<br /><br />15. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (4)<br /><br />16. (I've Just Begun) Having My Fun  (5+)<br /><br />17. Do Somethin'  (5)<br /><br />And to all those people saying Britney cant sing, I bet you CAN sing .<br /><br />that was sarcasm!<br /><br />This is great over  all:<br /><br />out of 85 marks this set gets....<br /><br />76/85<br /><br />Pretty cool set, I prefer our imported version though.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I have waited years for this album. I can't think of a person who deserves a greatest hits album more than Shania does. She has probably changed the face of music more than any other female artist since Madonna.  <br /> <br />I have been a fan from the beginning. I even own her first cd. The reason I love Shania so much is because she has made great music that's fun to listen to no matter what mood I'm in. I bought this cd even though I already own most of the songs because now I have most of my favorites all on one cd. And when I say most of my favorites, I mean it. There are 17 hits on this cd, plus the 4 new songs, giving us a grand total of 21 songs. For such a low price I think that is more than a bargain- it's a steal. Most of the songs come from Come on Over, which is no surprise because that cd was churning out hits more than 2 years after its release. It didn't sell 19 million copies in the US for nothing. The other big chunk of songs comes from her other smash, The Woman In Me. 3 songs come from her most recent album, Up!, and no songs come from her self-titled debut, which is a shame because those songs would have finally been given a chance to be heard by a bigger audience. <br /> <br />As for the songs themselves, they sound better than they ever have before. This cd gets bonus points for including some of her harder to find versions of her smash songs, like the pop versions of From This Moment On (which sounds terrific) and That Don't Impress Me Much (not as good as the original but I'm glad I now have it). Of course, some of my favorites are missing. Home Ain't Where His Heart Is Anymore and the radio version of God Bless the Child should be on here, but I can't complain because I don't know what should be removed to make room for those songs since Shania has had several big hits.  <br /> <br />The new songs are also a highlight. Both versions of Party For Two are here, and the country version is much better because I think Shania and Billy Curringtonsound great together. The pop version is OK, though. I Ain't No Quitter should be a favorite of her country fans. It' very catchy. The standout is Don't, the best ballad I've heard all year. Shania's voice sounds so great here and there is no reason why this shouldn't be a smash if it is released to radio. It is already one of my favorite Shania songs ever. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Shania, you should get this album. Her voice and vocal range are superb and her music never gets stale. Shania's music transcends all genre boundaries and sounds great in any format. It's got a good mix of country and pop songs and it is already one of my favorite albums of 2004, and I've only had it for a couple of days.
B0001CLGFK|5.0|I love strange movies so I have seen my fair share, but I have to say that without a doubt Eraserhead is the weirdest movie I have EVER seen. The whole time I was watching this movie I kept thinking how completley tripped out I would be if I was on acid or mushrooms, but after seeing eraserhead, I know for sure that that is not a trip I would want to take! <br />There is no way you could prepare yourself mentaly for this film, so when you watch it just keep a very open mind and enjoy this cult masterpeice and all it has to offer.
B00007KQA3|4.0|I have read the novel more than four times and was eager to watch the movie. I guess that the movie was faithful to the original work of Orwell. there is no doubt that Orwell wrote the book to attack the totalitarian governments. During his lifetime Orwell saw such governments in USSR and aimed at criticizing the ploicies of totalitarian states. 1984 was a book to be pointed at if you liked to tell people to read something that highlights the individual as a helpless creature facing the tyranny of the state. But after USSR dissolved and USA became the only power in the world one can't help thinking about Lord Acton's words \\"power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absoluetly.\\" The systematic process of brainwashing that is depicted in Orwell's 1984 is paralleled by the USA today:information distorted; American ideology justified (wars in the name of Christ and human rights); media is herded and is herding the masses..etc. The irony is that Orwell's 1984 was once used by capitalists and Americans to attack USSR and communism. Now, unfortunately, 1984 is a work that backfired the so called American civilized values.
B00009M6VJ|2.0|The film is directed by Alan Parker (British), who picked up this script written by Charles Randolph, formerly professor of philosophy teaching in Vienna.  And titular 'David Gale' is a man waiting for execution in Death Row in, you know, the State of Texas, which sooner or later reminds us of one US President. <br /> <br />Yes, using the form of thriller, the film is trying to be provocative, and that is about death penalty.  David Gale, played by Kevin Spacey, is sentenced to death, and now waiting for the time.  He is arrested for raping and murdering Constance (Laura Linney), but the great irony is that he was once known as first-rate professor of philosophy in the academic world, and more importantly, as activist for abolishing capital punishment. <br /> <br />Just three days before the execution, David Gale appoints one journalist Elizabeth Bloom (Kate Winslet), and asks to come to meet him, and write a memoir of his life.  David recounts his story, and during the short period the journalist begins to suspect that he is wrongly accused for the murder. <br /> <br />The setting is not new; a man (or woman) in Death Row, and someone outside the wall has to prove his/her innocence.  But the originality (if I may call that way) lies in the last chapter of the film, which of course I cannot reveal.  All I can say is that, there is a big surprise (but not exactly a difficult one to guess) -- and the surprise is not a clever one as the film believes it to be.  And moreover, it has a strong social message about the ethics surrounding capital punishment, but this argument looks, to me, a real suspect.  In short, it's off-putting, even pompous.    <br /> <br />And again I say, the message is about death penality, which needs more careful treatment.  'Dead Man Walking' was tilted to one side, to be sure, but it showed the other side's view, if not quite adequately.  I do not endorse any opinion here, and do not want to.  But 'The Life of David Gale' handles this very hotsocial issue so carelessly that I could not help thinking that this film is actually damaging the cause it attempts to support. <br /> <br />As a thriller, it is not bad; but the incredible ending, and too showy acting (from you know who) just do not help, and if they really think that they (including co-producer Nicholas Cage) can raise a hot debate about this important issue, they are utterly mistaken.
B00068IOWC|2.0|Okay, I'm a long time U2 fan.  I like their early work _Boy_, _October_ and _War_.  I also like some of the middle era work, _Actung Baby_ and _Zooropa_.  Heck, every U2 CD has some good stuff.  I've got 'em all, and I can't think of any that I don't like something on.  On this one, I really like \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\" (though it could use a shorter title.)  Trouble is, I don't really like much else on this CD.  Vertigo is okay, but not great. <br /> <br />Of course your mileage may vary, but this is not one of my favorites.
B00003CXXM|5.0|There's just something about this movie gets under my skin. I've watched it at least 10 times and it doesn't get old.  I think it's appeal can be attributed to a number of things: First of all, Matt Damon. He's great and  makes the character of Bourne believable and interesting. Second, Franka Potente as Marie.  She really grows on you and the relationship between Bourne and Marie, is I think, a key element in the story. (Can't believe what they do to her in the sequel!!  Is the writer insane??)  Also, the European setting.  Makes me nostalgic for the years I lived there.  Bourne rocks!!!

And every other guy that came over here & gave everything he had & spilled his guts, wants. For our country to love us, as much as we love it. That is what I want.\\"<br /><br />- Rambo speaks, to his Colonel, as the voice of every American Veteran, (past, present, & future) & reminds Americans & the world over that freedom has a price thats worth fighting for, but, sometimes the simple personal rewards are elusive in \\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\"<br /><br />Thanks to the big screen & video success of \\"First Blood\\", Rambo lives on this second installment, thats just as good as the previous film, but, tends to get quite cartoonish towards the films end.<br /><br />Serving a five year plus jail sentence for the trashing of the town in \\"First Blood\\", \\"Rambo\\" opens with the former Green Beret hammering rocks in the local prison. That doesn't last long as Colonel Sam Trautman, Rambo's former CO in the military, pays him a visit & offering him a sweet deal.<br /><br />Satelite recon had picked up some unexpected movement in the P.O.W. camp that Rambo escaped from in '71. The camp is supposed to be abandoned, but, may still be holding some of Rambo's former P.O.W.'s. Rambo's mission is to sneak into the camp and take pictures & document actions of the camp's activities and report back to base. Trautman & American Forces would step in and invade the camp reclaiming & bringing home the P.O.W.'s.  This would also lead to Rambo being reinstated in the special forces and, if the mission is a success, a Presidential Pardon on his prison record, with Rambo walking away a free man.<br /><br />Rambo reluctantly accepts the challenge, but, upon sneaking into the camp he does indeed find many American Troops still being held hostage beaten, malnutritioned, and one breath away from death. Rambo screws his Kodak moment, taking matters into his own hands. If you've watched \\"First Blood\\" you know what happens next.<br /><br />Filmed entirely in Mexico, \\"Rambo\\" is a different film than the first, but retains and expands the violence quotient. Stallone exchanged working in weather that was ten to fifteen below zero & wading in water thats 39 degrees farenheit (remember the scene in \\"First Blood\\" where the National Guard is out looking for Rambo who was all along hiding amongst the rocks of the river? Yeah, that water was 39 degrees farenheit. Thats cold ass water to be hiding in). Instead, for \\"Rambo\\", Sly worked in weather that reached 110 degrees and, in one scene where Rambo is captured by the Viet Cong, is dipped, from the neck down, in pig slop complete with real live leeches (the Russian General uses Rambo's knife to pick one off his chest. Gross).<br /><br />The helicopter battle at the end of the film was pretty dangerous. The helicopters flew so low, that in one quick shot of the Russian copter flying over one of the huts, the copter takes the roof off! Director George P. Cosmatos left the scene in to show the danger & peril of the battle.<br /><br />Stallone's daily schedule was getting up and working out for two to three hours in the early morning, a ten to twelve hour shooting day, & a two to three hour workout at night. All told, Stallone's average work week with the workouts included was approx. 80 to 90 hours a week. Its also said that Stallone was at his leanest, practically resculpturing his body for this movie, as well as, for \\"Rocky IV\\".<br /><br />\\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\" was released for the Memorial Day weekend of 1985, and proceeded to punch a hole in American pop-culture. Everything from toys, bubble gum cards, & a cartoon series were produced to cash in on the success of the film.<br /><br />As for the S.E. DVD, this is definitely the definitive edition of the film (the recent Ultimate Edition is a dissapointment). Features include a retrospective of the film from Cosmatos, Stallone, Richard Crenna & others, to trailers, an audio commentary from the director, DTS audio soundtrack with Dolby Digital & surround. Rambo is not expendable and neither is this DVD.retrospective of the film from Cosmatos, Stallone, Richard Crenna & others, to trailers, an audio commentary from the director, DTS audio soundtrack with Dolby Digital & surround.

B0000013G9|4.0|This is TLC's best album to date. It has a far more mature sound than their debut record. They really have grown into amazing artists. The sales of the album showed that this is loved by many. <br /> <br />This record has got 4 totally crazy singles. Creep, Red Light Special, Waterfalls & Diggin' On You are simply awesome. 3 of them went to number 1 I think. There are no fillers in this album, every song played its part well. The interludes are repetitive melody wise, but its different lyrically. Sexy Interlude is so hilarious with Chilli calling some guy and initially he thought that she want some phone sex or somethin' but actually she want some tissue! Kinda lame but cracks me up. <br /> <br />My other favorite tracks are Kick Your Game, Let's Do It Again and If I Was Your Girlfriend which is a sample. Many artists followed suit with sampling or covering that song (Mariah, Jay-Z, Toni Braxton etc..)But I find this album to be quite mellow and moody. Its not upbeat like their debut. Chilli's vocals were strong in this album than others. Left Eye's rap is cool. T-Boz's low voice is a signature sound in any TLC record.  <br /> <br />Get this if you're new to TLC (where you've been all these years?)cuz its their best and most sincere-sounding album. <br />
B0000640S3|3.0|\\"What do you say John?\\"<br /><br />\\"*u*k'em.\\" - Rambo tells Colonel Trautman how he feels about the Russian Army, & terrorism in general in \\"Rambo III\\"<br /><br />The first was in defense. The second was for redemption. And \\"Rambo III\\" is about the honor of loyalty toward friends & mentors.<br /><br />A decent final entry in the \\"Rambo\\" Trilogy, but, its funny how things change over the years. Look upon this action film as just that and you shouldn't have any problems.<br /><br />After Rambo declines an offer to help his former CO, Colonel Sam Trautman, in a mission to help middle-eastern \\"rebels\\" in their fight against the Russian Army, the Vietnam Vet. is forced back into action after Trautman is captured by Russian forces.<br /><br />\\"Rambo III\\" is easily the weakest of the three films. The dialogue is stilted. The scene where Trautman explains to Rambo that he will always be a warrior is a howl (especially the reference to the sculpture and the artist). There is a bit of goofy one-line humor from Rambo that doesn't really work (lines like \\"I fired a few shots.\\" are like lead bombs). The cave sequence had a been there done that feel. \\"Rambo III\\" was released for the Memorial Day weekend of 1988 & by this time the industry had been saturated with films inspired by or similar to the first 2 \\"Rambo\\" films.<br /><br />The S.E. DVD is worth a look at for the interesting featurettes, including \\"A Land In Crisis\\". Trailers and the usual special edition items are also included.<br /><br />As for \\"Rambo IV\\"? It would be interesting to see Rambo go back and kick a.s.s. against his former muslim buddies, but, don't hold your breath. Stallone is creeping up there in age and in this post 9/11 atmosphere any film that could offend any Muslim, putting them in a bad light (like as if they don't deserve it) has a snowballs chance in hell of getting made into a feature. Just ask Bruce Willis where \\"Die Hard IV\\" is.

B000002J09|1.0|To all you die hard Zepplin Fans out there I have to tell you guys that your wrong about them bein the greatest Rock N Roll Band.  I was 9 when I started listining to them and it took me a month and a half to not like these guys. I'm 14 now and I don't listen to the crap made today (I listen to The Velvet Underground The Doors and Dylan.) All the kids in my school think Zepplin is god well they aren't there a bunch of drunken satanic buffons. Oh and the Foggy notion that they were the first band to involve Medieval Literature you are wrong. The Velvets and The Doors did in fact Sterling Morrison of The Velvets had a P.H.D in Medieval Literature  IN '70 a year before this crap came out. All you Zep fans are wrong about music get a Velvet Underground album thats hard rock.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Oh my god what have they done? Is it just me or is it that ever scince the release of this new album Green day has become another one of MTV's little drones? The fact that they would spend as much money as they did on a music video is actually quite anti-punk and offends me greatly. If you have no depth and don't care about whether or not a band is a big money seeker with no other goal then you might like this, if not search elsewhere. If you must have your Green day fix please listen to their older albums and only if you absolutley need to because those arn't that great either. If you say \\"Ooh good charolette isn't punk (which they arnt) they just wear all that makeup to look cool.\\" Well guess what people Green day is just as guilty so dont complain and dont buy this album.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris's book, The End of Faith, is a bold plea today for mankind to wake up. Harris believes religious sectarianism leads to dualistic thought. Dualistic thinking leads to hate and war and religions promote dualistic thinking. Religions are based on faith. Faith is belief that is not based on any proof. If we build our future upon faith, we will eventually bring destruction to all life. We all have a clarion call to wake up. Myths and superstitions must be resigned. Harris's freethinking is in the same vein as past freethinkers. He boldly makes the case for more scientific and secular solutions to the social and political challenges we face today.  <br />  <br />There is a chapter on Islam, forty-four pages, that should be required reading for everyone. Muslims included. Radical fundimentalists are trapped in their own penitentiary of terrorism and murder, killing infidels, Israelis, Americans, each other and even more sordidly, suicidally themselves. <br />  <br />Harris makes his case that mind science today is finding how to awaken, and grasp our most subtle thoughts and emotions, through the process of meditation. Deep meditation awakens in the mind an at-one -ness that brings on deep awareness. Included in the awareness, values and morals. Our ancient scriptures and texts have come to us to metaphorically teach us the meaning of the bliss that comes from this awareness. Prophets, sages, teachers, scholars from around the world, throughout history, have tried to communicate through these metaphors the \\"oneness\\" of man. <br />  <br />This is a courageously important book at a time when individuals and civilizations are again judging each other by dogmatic sectarian faith. <br />  <br />
B00005JLEX|5.0|It contains a LOT of special features: \\"Inside Look\\" to most episodes explaining how they wrote it, Deleted scenes, bloopers, interviews.  The story of the show. Early TV appearences, Audio & subtitles in 4 langues, etc. <br /> <br />Each disc comes in it's own case.  They couldn't have made it better.
0553288105|5.0|<br />  I recently read The Gods Themselves by Isaac Asimov.  The book displayed wonderful insights into complicated scientific theories that I for one would not have been able to comprehend without the story to help.  Through all of the subtle hints and clues presented in the book, I found myself coming to the same conclusions at roughly the same time that the characters in the book did.  Asimov took science fiction and used it as for which it was meant, taking the difficult concepts and explaining them within plotline.   I believe that this book would be a great tool for a person that wants to understand parts of theoretical physics but does not know where to start or a person that wants to get his teenage child interested in the field. <br />  <br />The story itself takes place in three segments, each building on the first with little or no direct overlapping.  The three places are the moon, earth, and the home of the paramen, a parallel universe that gave the new technology to the humans.  There are a handful of people that believe that the earth will be destroyed due to a new technological source and they have to figure out how they are going to get their peers to accept their conclusions and save the universe.  Each character has to go behind the backs of those in higher power and intellectual regard than themselves to try to save the doomed universe. <br />
B00005JMEW|1.0|Let me start this review by reminding everyone how much Tarantino sucks ass.  Everyone loves this guy for basically no reason...He made Pulp Fiction, great, but that movie blows.  I mean seriously, it was a mesh of inconsequential garbage losely tied together and littered with sophomoric dialogue that certainly worked to fool a lot of viewers into thinking it was somewhat significant.  To top it all off, they add swearing and gore, so people won't be scared to think it's 'cool'.  The whole movie blows.   <br />Anyway, Kill Bill is stupid.  Who wants to see an ugly banana jump around pretending she doesn't suck at martial arts.  Honestly, could the martial arts suck any more?  Tarantino has such a huge ego inside his watermelon-sized dome that he thinks I care about his girly little 'style'.  Someone needs to stick a javelin in his brain.
0064407667|3.0|On the day that the Baudelaire children receive the news that their parents are dead, their lives take a serious turn for the worst.  With family friend Mr. Poe acting as executor of their parents' will, they move in with he and his family until more permanent arrangements can be made.  These \\"arrangements\\" come eventually in the form of the menacing Count Olaf.  Count Olaf is an alleged \\"distant\\" relative with whom the children must go to live (in accordance with their parents' wishes -- that they live with a relative).  Hence, Klaus, Violet and Sunny move into the Counts dirty, evil home.  There they find quickly that the Count's only desire is to get his hands on the children's inheritance.  The only bright spot to their new home is the Count's neighbor, the sweet and caring Justice Strauss.  However, they quickly find that the evil intentions of their new guardian will find use in even the most innocent and caring of souls.  Dark and somewhat fantastical, I found the first in the series an interesting read;  although you'll find these books in the children's section, I consider at least the debut novel to be too disturbing for young readers. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB

0670880728|4.0|Didn't think I'd care for this novel, as typically I don't like stories told in diary format.  But who can help but love Bridget?  Book details her hilarious battle with her weight (which seems to fluctuate wildly at night), her struggle with her nicotine addiction, and detailed chronicling of both her alcohol and caloric consumption.  More riveting still is her love life and \\"involvement\\" with the elusive David (and his concern for the \\"missing\\" skirt) and obsession with being Single. <br />I don't believe that there is a woman alive who cannot relate to Bridget and her struggles--however ridiculous at times.  Although I found the book many times to be laugh-out-loud funny, I struggled intermittently with the strong British references throughout--more than I have with any of the other British authors whose work I've read.  However, that will in no way deter me from reading--and enjoying--the sequel. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB
B00005JLYW|1.0|OK, i just saw this thing for a second time and i hate myself even more for sitting thru it twice, i must be a masochist, i guess i wasn't sure if really hated it...well i do. Not only is this a travesty of film making (the story is barely patched together, a lot of it doesn't even make sense, at one point it looks the the Angels can actually fly! am i missing something?) The subplot with John Cleese is lame (poor Mr. Cleese, at least Shia Lebouf or whatever his name is can blame his youth on his cameo) The movie is just plain dumb...at least the first one was original in it's idiocy. And let's be honest, Drew is a an attractive woman and will turn heads pretty much everywhere, but when you team her up with two supermodels in Cameron and Liu...well...come on... And someone tell McG to stop using all these great 70's tunes in his horrible movies! they're tainting my memories!
B00005JNEI|1.0|So let's see here: for all the predicament of the Iraq war, for all the dodgy and ultra suspicious happenings, hampered investigations for 911, for all the innocent lives lost both from the american perspective and the world in general, for the quaqmire of the american economy, well, basically for everything we can blame it all on one person. Da current president. <br /> <br />    Michael Moore either doesnt understand or pretends not to, that the system under which the U.S functions does so despite of particular persons. Nothing much would change had Kerry for example been elected and to propagandise the opposite is actually naive and suspicious in itself. Capitalism, communism, whichever such system based on classes functions the way it does regardless of who's in power. <br /> <br />    The fact that this is ignored by Moore who launches a rather cheap offensive on Bush as if he is the critical part of the puzzle is enough to dismiss his film alltogether as populistic propaganda to be consumed only by the politically uneducated. <br /> <br />   If one thing impressed me about this film is that Moore does touch (at the beginning) some thorny issues only to suddenly leave them be and proceed making jokes about Bush being on vacation too much. But Moore and anybody for that matter would also be on frequent vacation if his agenda was going according to plan and if he wasn't really needed to begin with. And lastly, there are more facts being ignored on this film than the ones actually revealed. <br /> <br />    Moore is without a shred of a doubt a great entertainer as well as a very good filmmaker. But a political mind he's not, at least not a deep-delving one which is exactly where his problem lies: he has convinced himself that he's both.
B000002JSP|5.0|This was Zeppelins last studio album together before the break up.  When I first got the album i wasn't disapointed at all.  All songs are great; but i have to admit the only \\"so called\\" \\"downside\\" of the album was to much keyboard.  But there is nothing down about that when it comes to Zepp.   <br />Song Ratings: <br /> <br />1. In the Evening(10/10): great opening for the song and album <br /> <br />2. South Bound Saurez(9/10): Nice keyboard riffs <br /> <br />3. Fool in the Rain(10/10): One of the best songs on the album <br /> <br />4. Hot Dog(8/10): Funny and Quick-not the best song on the album but still worth listening too. <br /> <br />5. Carouselambra(10/10): Here it is, the best song on the album(in my opinion).  the first 3 minutes of the song are the best-filled up with hype and excitement through the whole song.   <br /> <br />6. All my Love(10/10): Another good song-lovable and relaxing. <br /> <br />7. I'm Gonna Crawl(9/10): Last song-a great closer.  Smooth and Relaxing.   <br /> <br />Overal i give the album 5 stars because of the sound and different riffs of Zeppelin.  And it was a great recovery from the darkness of Presence, not saying Presence was bad at all.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I guess the fast edits, etc wasn't really for everybody. <br /> <br />The quality of the footage is very good, the lighting, as well as the effects on the shots (ie. fast zoom &#62; invert &#62; flash &#62; cut) was really well done and well planned. <br /> <br />The menus are really nice as well. They're very seamless and the art direction is top-notch!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Excellent Picture!  The story revolves not so much around prison life as it does the friendship that developes between Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) and some of the other inmates.  Sort of a woman's movie for guys.  Dufresne has the usual troubles in prison but there's one major item that looms in the air.  He really is innocent.  Robbins gives a good performance here.  He still speaks through his teeth.  You know how he does when he's got a serious scene.  I must comment though.  Morgan Freeman steals almost every scene.  He has developed his craft like an old master.  He is one of todays best actors and I believe he is still very underrated.  He can easily carry a starring role with no problem.  I do wish that Hollywood would stop using him as a second banana.      Bob Gunton as the bible toting, evil, crooked warden, Samuel Norton, does an exquisite job with his role.  He is deliciously evil.  You can't wait to see him get what's coming to him.  As evil as he was though, he did have a real fondness for Andy.  As long as Andy didn't cross him things were okay.  Guntons's performance works because he is evil but still adds some good qualities deep inside.  Way deep, deep, deep inside.  Some folks say the movie is too long.  I strongly disagree.  The length is necessary as the story is about the passage of time in prison.   These men are supposed to be \\"lifers.\\"  You can't do that in a half hour of film!       The cinematography is beautiful.  As the picture begins, the helicopter shot of the prison passing below along with the scoring is picture perfect.  It's a lovely shot.  The score is beautiful.  My favorite shot is another helicopter shot of Red and Andy after they are released from prison.   Andy tells Red where to find him if he's ever released.  He also tells Red to go to a spot where He's left some money for Red.  He finds the money, breaks parole and buys a bus ticket out of town.  Red arrives to find Andy on the beach trying to restore an old fishing boat.  As the two men lay eyes on each other the music is playing and the shot pulls back further and further.  There is no dialogue here.  Just two old friends embracing each other as the copter shot pulls back further still.  It's as if the intention is not to intrude on this personal, private moment between these old friends.  I have to admit I sometimes watch that scene again and again.      Freeman narrates the film.  We are seeing the story through his character's remembrances so it's appropriate.  He does so without being over emotional or sappy.  This film can be watched again and again without it going stale.  There is some prison stereotype behavior but it is easily overlooked in this well acted drama.  Casting was very accurate all the way around.  What a shame that no Oscars were handed over to anyone involved with this film.  Please don't let this one get away.  It's a real gem.  Well directed.  Bravo!!
1559408758|5.0|This movie, unlike, say, The Decline Of Western Civilization, conveys a realistic portrayal of what it's like to be in a working, touring band.  Admittedly, it goes a bit overboard, but it's still pretty accurate.  This is coming from a working musician who has been playing in front of audiences for over twenty years. <br /> <br />The technical problems - getting lost on the way to the stage, the six-inch Stonehenge monolith (complete with dwarves kicking it around), the wireless receiver picking up air traffic noise, the pod that fails to open - every working musician has had problems like that, although I'm pretty safe in saying that there haven't been too many exploding drummers.  And the arguments between the members of the group are all too familiar to anyone who has picked up a guitar, bass, or drum sticks. <br /> <br />At any rate, this film should be required viewing for anyone who thinks they want to be a musician.  If, after watching it, they still think they can handle it, they should go ahead.  However, I'm sure that more than a few people sat down to watch it and decided afterward not to go to the hock shop and buy that old guitar they were looking at the week before. <br /> <br />All of that said, this is a hysterically funny film.  Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean are amazingly talented comedians, actors, and songwriters.  It's hard not to tap your foot to songs like \\"(Tonight) I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight\\" or \\"Big Bottom\\". <br /> <br />See this film.  See it again.  Watch it on a continuous loop over and over again for a week.  You'll still be laughing when it's done.
B00062J00S|5.0|Would you believe that this film tanked at the box office?  Critics ripped it to shreds saying that it was too sappy and sweet.  Humbug.  This is the most classic film of all time and if you haven't seen this yet then you haven't really had Christmas.  Yes, yes I know they show it 500,000 times every Christmas but that's because people love it so.  I'm glad that Jimmy Stewart lived long enough to see it become so loved by movie watchers around the world.   <br /> <br />In case you've been living on Mars for the past hundred years, it's the story of George Bailey (James Stewart) who wants to build great buildings and travel the world.  He feels left out as all his friends go on to college while he helps his father at the family business.  Just when he's all set to finally go to college his father dies and he has to stay on at the Bailey Building and Loan.  A few years later his brother comes home but has just gotten married and received a job offer even though he was supposed to be coming home to take over the business so George could finally travel.  No such luck. <br /> <br />Finally George realizes that he's not going anywhere and he's married with four kids.  One day his uncle misplaces $8,000.00 bucks and George is threatened with jail time.  He loses all hope and decides it would be better if he had never been born and plans to commit suicide but an angel shows him what would have happend if he had not been born. The angel convinces him that he should not throw away God's greatest gift.  It turns out that he helped so many people (including saving the life of his only brother) none of them would have made it without his help.  Because he saved his brother, his brother was able to save the lives of many of his comrads in the army.  Because of that, his brother won the Congressional Medal of Honor.  But George learns that if he had not been there to save his brother, every man on that army transport would have died because his brother would not have been there tosave them.  Because he helped so many along the way, they in turn help him when he's in the darkest pit of his life.  <br /> <br />This may be the most spoofed movie of all time.  Saturday Night Live spoofed it more than once and so did Married with Children just to name a couple of shows.  Perhaps even more spoofed is the ever popular Scrooge. <br /> <br />It's a Wonderful Life is a Timeless classic.  It applies itself to any year, any day, any country, any family, any race.  \\"One life touches so many others.\\"  Ain't that the truth.  Don't pass this by.  Please watch this with your children.  It is still as heart warming as ever.  You can even take it back to Mars with you when you leave!!!
B0006399FS|3.0|Where is the distortion and power of achtung baby.? I must be going deaf because I can't hear one change in the drum beat from song to song.The drums are non-existent. <br />This cd put me to sleep-The edge's guitar is boring. <br />the only reason I gave this cd 3 stars is Adam Clayton's bass is mesmerizing.He is definitly on his game.
B00005JMAH|4.0|When I first watched PoA in the theatres, I, like so many others, was disappointed that it was not as faithful to the book as the first two. However, after watching it a dozen more times, I was able to appreciate how truly artistic Cuaron's interpretation was of Rowling's world. After viewing the interviews that came with the DVD, I realized that many of the things they were doing was with the knowledge and consent of Jo Rowling herself. Having worked in the entertainement industry myself, I know that book to script adaptation is more difficult than one would think. Additionally, production scheduling, scouting, casting, etc., is not exactly a cakewalk. PoA is a very involved story and very complicated to adapt to a script. I think Cuaron did what most directors do and created his own vision. Whether or not die-hard fans agree with his vision is a moot argument as the film is already done. Now we shall wait anxiously for the release of the next one. Of course, Cuaron did get a little happy with fader switch....
B0006399FS|2.0|U2 is a pretty amazing band.  They have been together a long time with the same members ( a very rare thing these days), and they have put out some incredible albums, and many times over re-invinted their sound during their career.  This album doesn't do any of that, the songs are nice, but way too safe sounding.  There is no new sound here, and honestly it sounds like step backwards in terms of song writing.   I still like U2 a lot, and this album doesn't change that, like any band some albums will be classics, and others won't, this album is one of the others.
B000687M48|4.0|I am a fan of Evanescence and I couldn't wait for this CD/DVD to come out. When I got it, I was both happy and disappointed. <br /> <br />The CD is pretty good, but the cheering in the background gets real annoying, real fast. The new songs Farther Away and Breathe No More are very good, and the spinoff of Thoughtless was very nice. Missing had to be the best song on the CD (No cheering) and the vocals and music were very nice. <br /> <br />The Music Videos were awesome. They are all eerie in their own part, but I was very happy to see them on the DVD. They were one of the main reasons I really wanted the CD. <br /> <br />The Live Concert was ok. The camera jumped around too much. Every two or three seconds the camera changed angles and it was a little disorientating. Plus, the cheering maxed out the music and Amy's voice causing you to stain to hear it. <br /> <br />The Behind the Scenes was entertaining and funny. A lot of people look at Evanescence as a gothic-depressing band when in reality they are just regular people having fun. <br /> <br />Overall, I liked this and it should keep me happy until the Sequel to FALLEN is out, but I really wish they would have edited out some of the cheering.
B000687M48|4.0|I really did like this CD (haven't gotten to the DVD yet!).  The picture inside the liner notes was great...Amy looked so gothic and REAL!  However, the concert is just lacking something.  Amy just doesn't seem to be into it.  The songs are too short, and it just seems like the whole band is rushing to get through with the concert.  Maybe it has to do with the recording techniques.  Maybe it has to do with the band.  I don't know.  But, I think Evanescence had better take a hard look at themselves, for their time may be fleeting.  Another thing that is hurting them is lack of new material.  Frankly, BRING ME TO LIFE and MY IMMORTAL are getting old.  The band needs to write some new music to expand their discography.  I gave this album 4 stars because of the lack of luster.  If they had been a little more enthusiastic, I would have definitely given them 5.  I hope they will put out a new album soon!
0880389052|5.0|Out of all the Forgotten Realms books I've read, this has to be one of the best. Salvator goes into exquisite detail in describing the world of the Drow and Menzoberranzan. The story which follows a unique male Drow by the name Drizzt Do'Urden is very developed and wonderfully artistic. This will be a treat for any person who has a taste for fantasy books.
B0006399FS|5.0|Hands down, the best U2 cd to date.  I really find it odd that as far as the reviews go on this site, people have either loved it or hated it.  I dont understand this.  What I have deduced is that there is such a difference between the buyers of U2's newest effort.  If you were expecting a cd chock full of more \\"vertigo,\\" then you are unfortunately out of luck.  If you are, however, a devout U2 fan that has been a listener for many years, you will no doubt enjoy this album.  \\"Vertigo\\" was both a blessing a curse for the band.  it was such a non-U2 song, yet something i really enjoyed nonetheless.  however, because it was so much different from what U2 usually releases, it of course brought with it different music listeners that liked the single so much that they couldn't wait to buy the entire album.  So for all those 1 and 2 star critics out there, just know that you cant be taken seriously.  For the true fans, this album is fantastic, my favorite to date.  \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" has to rank as one of U2's best.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is widely acknowledged as the greatest jazz album of all time, and while I have a hard time making up my mind and saying for certain that any one recording is number one, this is definitely in the running. The fact of the matter is that this is the real deal, a truly great album. That is, of course, not to say that it is the only jazz album out there, but it's at the top of the list. While this shouldn't be the only one you own, it should be among the first (if not the first). <br /> <br />Additionally I'd like to comment on statements indicating that it's not all it's cracked up to be. To say that this album allows virtuosic display to get in the way of musicality denies the very nature of Miles Davis, just look at how he did when he tried that with Charlie Parker in the late 40's. This is the exact opposite: Miles's solo on So What is a prime example, not overstated, yet it says everything that it needs to then moves on to Trane's searching, intense solo. To say that it is anything but spontaneous (true jazz, improvized) is idiocy, the band hadn't even seen many of the charts before the recording date as Bill Evans states in the liner notes. The heads are just enough to inspire improvization but not so much as to retract from it and become a crutch. These solos are pure, profound, and rich in texture, meaning, and emotion. In short, the album is a masterpiece.
B000021XS0|5.0|Before Dream Theater released this album they had released \\"Falling into Infinity\\" back in 1997. That album wasn't up to par with earlier Dream Theater albums such as \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Awake\\". Boy, did Dream Theater come back with a bang. <br /> <br />In 1999 they would go on to release this album the second part to \\"Metropolis Part 1:The Miracle and The Sleeper\\", which is a 9 and a half minute epic which appears on their 1992 album \\"Images and Words\\". <br /> <br />First off, this is one of the best concept albums ever written, right up their with the classic \\"Operation:Mindcrime\\" by Queensryche(HIGHLY reccomended). I could go on about the story because me and a few others have found out every little detail in these amazing lyrics.  But, i don't want to spoil it for you all. <br /> <br />Standout tracks here are \\"Beyond this Life\\", \\"Home\\", \\"The Spirit Carries On\\", and \\"Finally Free\\". When it comes to this album a lot of Dream Theater fans can't agree on what the staandout tracks really are. That is simply because they are all so good. The astounding playing in each song makes me wonder how more people haven't heard of this band. John Pertucci(Guitars) and Mike Portnoy(Drums and Percussion) have got to be the best at what they do. While Jordan Ruddess(keyboards), James LaBrie(Vocals), and John Myung(Bass) are also superb.  <br /> <br />All in all, I highly reccomend this to any fan of music, one of the best there is out there.
B000003489|5.0|Over the nearly 20 years preceding the release of this album, starting with the unrecorded jam sessions at Minton's and Monroe's, the masters of bebop developed virtuosity unmatched by those that came before while ensuring that it did not prevent them from truly creating an art with depth, musicality, and expression. This date was the culmination of this movement, with chord changes more complex than ever before at tempos that were rarely matched. The masters would have been hard pressed to sculpt art under these conditions. Yet Coltrane proved himself up to it from the very beginning of his solo on the title cut to the last note of the album. His ideas express themselves so succinctly as to sound complete, vivid, and calm through the \\"sheets of sound\\" that he came to be known for starting at this date. An awesome recording.
B000002UEB|5.0|I could go on and on about how great these songs are, or how great the songwriting and stories are. But, it's already been done for you and me in almost every other review. <br /> <br />It is most likely the best concept album of all time, fi not one of the greatest albums period. Highlight tracks are \\"The Mission\\", \\"Suite Sister Mary\\", and \\"Eyes of a Stranger\\". <br /> <br />Excellent album, great buy.
B0006284JQ|3.0|This IS her Greatest Hits....Aside from not including Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know and Born To Make You Happy it does include all of her hits (good and bad). Plus the new songs: My Prerogative (I like the original better) & Do Somethin' which I really like. That song just sounds so different from her other stuff. I was more excited to get the bonus CD which advertised on the cover: Unreleased remixes....With the exception of 1 remix (Breathe On Me) that is an out & out lie. I either have the other remixes or I have heard them. So, I was quite disappointed in that. If you have all of her CD's, I wouldn't bother. The art work is pretty weak as well. But if you are a die hard fan than I think you will be really satisfied!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Edward Said's \\"Orientalism\\" has been standard reading for just about every humanities course on offer in any decent university in the english speaking west for the last twenty years at least. How is it that amongst the hundreds of reviews that I have read of Sofia Cappola's latest offering I have found only one reviewer (a Japanese critic writing for The Guardian) who noticed that the film is literally overflowing with the racist cliches that Said identified as lying at the heart of so much of the West's interpretations of Eastern culture?  <br /> <br />Since when did it become OK to laugh at the fact that the average Japanese person tends to be shorter than the average American person - a \\"joke\\" that was deployed a number of times and which made me shift uncomfortably in my seat, especially when everyone else in the theatre errupted into laughter. Where were the shower scenes filmed I wonder? Certainly not in the five star hotel featured in the rest of the film because there is simply not a five star hotel in the entire country where you are going to hit your head on a shower nozzle - the Japanese are too culturally sensitive to the requirements of Westerners to commit such obvious mistakes. A cultural sensitivity not reciprocated in this dreadful film.  <br /> <br />Nor is it OK to suggest that the Japanese language is worth laughing at in and of itself. The purported verbosity of the language is in fact simply untrue, and even if it were, making a joke out of \\"difference\\" per se is tasteless to say the least. <br /> <br />The film fell into the same trap that so many Western cultural products fall into when attempting to navigate other cultures from the outside. There was \\"good\\" Japanese culture - flower arranging, buddhist temples etc, and \\"ridiculous\\" Japanese culture - game shows, incomprehensible yapping etc. In other words, aspects of the other culture that have been reinterpreted to the satisfaction of the West are presented in a positive light, and the rest is simply fair fodder for a good laugh. We don't get it so it must be ridiculous. Hardly. <br /> <br />Cappola simply failed to distance herself from the racist jokes that the film relied on for it's humour. Japanese culture was indeed \\"Lost in Translation\\" and presented simply as wierd, crazy, unintelligible and worthy of a good hearty laugh, as were the Japanese people themselves who insisted on yapping in that ridiculous language of theirs and being short. Next time the director should stick to a culture she understands, or at the very least acknowledge her position as an outsider and recognise that not everything that is different is funny.
B00005JMUL|2.0|A milestone in cinema computer animation production. However, with all the technology, the bottom line of any film is an interesting and original storyline.  THE POLAR EXPRESS is wrought with predictability and dullness.  The audience knows the train is headed for the north pole to end up at Santa's villiage and work shop. The audience knows the main character is going to hop on the train, meet up with a bunch of precocious children (Eddie Deezen's --1941, GREASE, I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND-- annoying voice is the most recognizable of the bunch)and other uninteresting characters (i.e. the train conductor, the hobo etc). The audience knows that somehow the main child character will end up meeting Santa Clause and change his disbelief. Lastly, the plot device of whether this is a dream or reality is a tired cliche done in movies from THE WIZARD OF OZ to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. To get back to the technology and animation technique, it takes its look from a children's story book by Chris Van Allsburg. Then the actor's motion and facial expressions are transcribed into a computer program and given the cgi treatment etc. However, it looks haunting, dark, and creepy especially once the Polar Express reaches Santa's village and the townspeople and elves appear.  It looks like a bunch of people being sent off to concentration camps. Overall...Overrated!! Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis have a pretty good track record of great films, but this is a vanity project that falls short of its promise.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool fans are hard to figure. Half of them get into Tool for the image/message, half for the music. Ignore all the spiritual interpretations, ignore all the deep introspection, ignore all the hype, and you still get the best metal album ever made. If you are a musician, the album gets twenty times better with every listen. It moves and bends and feels right. Anyone who puts up a negative review for this album just doesn't connect to it, and that's fine. But for those of us that love it, nothing else compares.
6305144176|2.0|Overrated! The first two-thirds of GOOD MORNING VIETNAM is pretty good.  This is when the film is a comedy and Robin Williams as AFR's Saigon radio disc jockey Adrian Cronauer is doing his shtick and everyone is happy and laughing.  However, it goes into dark territory as the Williams' character experiences the horrors of war  and his time on-air becomes a little more serious than comedic. Also, Cronauer/Williams becomes involved with some of the local Vietnamese to give him a little dramatic licence. This slows down the story and almost wipes clean the comedy aspect of the film. All of a sudden, his superior who has it in for Cronauer and his radio show antics in the first place, Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) takes over the radio duties. Hauk's humor has more bombs than all that was dropped during the war. If the characters in the film are put off by Hauk/Kirby taking over the mic, it is more excrutiating for the film audience. Overall, a film which misses the target at the last third of the film because what starts out as a comedic vehicle for Williams becomes an apology-card for the Vietnam War.
B0006399FS|5.0|This is really a great album that signals a different level of age, maturity and tone for this legendary group.  Bono still has the magic touch.  IMO must listen tracks: #3 Sometimes you can't make it, #5 City of Blinding Lights, #6 All B/c of You, #7 A Man and a Woman, #8 Crumbs from your table. <br /> <br />Why some reviewers here fail to allow groups to age and still make great, slightly more humble music is ridiculous.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Diane Keaton plays a divorcee who finds love in the strangest of places: with her daughter's 60-something boyfriend (Jack Nicholson), a self-proclaimed playboy who's never had a serious relationship in his life.  The dynamic that makes this movie even more interesting is that both Keaton and Nicholson seem to be playing themselves on screen, or at least they're playing the characters that the media has made them out to be in real life.<br /><br />\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is a wonderful love story that will have you laughing from start to finish.  Nicholson and Keaton have great chemistry, and supporting cast members Frances McDormand and Amanda Peet are fabulous as well.  Keanu Reeves also has a supporting role as a love interest of Keaton's, and he does a fine job (I realize that might be hard for you to believe, but it's the truth).  I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
0393317552|1.0|I purchased this book, somewhat impulsively, hoping for a sort of brief history. Something that would cover all the main points for say the last 10,000 years. I was a little put off after I got through the preface and prolouge. This history book wasn't at all what I had hoped for. It seemed that the rest of the book what going to tell me how food, geology, etc was responsible for where people are in the world today, and not human ambition. Nevertheless, I decided to continue on reading to see if I could still get some of the classic world history I had been seeking. I didn't. At least not in any chronological order. <BR>   I found the author's arguments to be mildly convincing, but \\"ultimately\\" very boring, not to mention repetitive and fairly obvious. I give a 1/5 review to this book because, coincedently, 1/5th is as much as I could force myself to read. I also have to admit that had this book not recieved a pulitzer prize I wouldn't have bought it. I'll only make that mistake once.
B00003CXCT|4.0|...George Lucas could have done a better job.  The bottom line for me is that I've waited a very long time for the \\"Star Wars\\" movies to come out on DVD, and I'm happy to finally own them.  However, the boxed set could have been a little nicer.  The actual box that the DVDs come in is quite flimsy, which is disappointing.  It is also disappointing to see all the little tweaks and changes Lucas has made to all three movies, none of which really make anything better and a few of which have actually pissed a lot of fans off.  (For example, in one of the final scenes in \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" the ghost version of Darth Vader/Old Anakin that appears next to the ghosts of Yoda and Obi-Wan has been replaced with Hayden Christensen/20-something Anakin.  It doesn't make any SENSE!  They didn't replace Alec Guinness with Ewan McGregor, so why mess with Anakin at all?  I don't understand!)<br /><br />Despite the little indescrepancies, it's nice to have a version (any version) of the \\"Star Wars\\" films to enjoy.  Maybe Lucas will decide to release the original film versions on DVD one of these days, thereby making a lot of extra money for himself and satisfying his bewildered fans.
B00005YUPO|1.0|The thing that bothers me most about the Baby Einstein videos has always been the music.  They implicity suggest that by watching their videos, your baby will be exposed to the Mozart Effect and will become a genius overnight.  I am no expert in the psycology of music, but I have a feeling that when they were talking about \\"classical music\\", they meant REAL classical music and not some dumbed down synthesizer sounds.  The truth is, the videos do work - when you need a break in the day, your baby will watch them and fall into a trance.  But you might as well stick them in front of a test pattern or the drying laundry for that matter.  If you're interested in real classical music, I'd just pick up some real classical music CDs and play them while your child plays.  If you HAVE to get a video for some peace in the day, I've always thought Juno Baby did a very nice job (but they're not really available anywhere which is a bit annoying too) or Fantasia (if you can sit through an entire motion picture).  But, if you do watch any of these videos, I've always found it best to interact with your baby while watching - move to the rhythm of the music, dance and hum along, etc.  I understand the need for a break in the day, but these videos can be put to good developmental use too.
B0006399FS|4.0|U2 followed the way they succeed in ATYCLB.though Bono's voice is not as good as b4,and also there isn't a song as memorable as Walk On.the song here are even,far from bad,far from excellent. <br /> <br />i still love the U2 in 90's,like Achtung Baby or Zooropa ,when they were so creative... <br />but, this new album is not bad.
6304779356|5.0|I love \\"The Lost Boys\\". It is one of my favorite vampire films of all time. This is the one movie I can stomach watching both Coreys at the same time. Michael (Jason Patrick) and Sam (Corey Haim) moves to Santa Clara with their mother (Dianne Wiest). What they don't know is that Santa Clara is home to a bunch of blood-thirsty vampires. Sam meets up with a couple of vampire hunters one of them is Corey Feldman. Michael on the other hand hooks up with Kiefer Sutherland and his gang of blood-sucking vampires, and he really gets close to a young Jami Gertz. Yeah this movie has every cheesy stereotype about a vampire known to vampirekind but in a good cheesy kind of way. \\"The Lost Boys\\" is a comedic, horror film. Michael ends up getting tricked into the vampire lifestyle by Kiefer Sutherland. That was my favorite moment in the film when Michael was muching on what appeared to be Chinese food. The music for this movie is timeless. I especially love the Roger Daltrey song. I loved Bernard Herrman (of \\"The Gilmore Girls) and Kiefer Sutherland in their perspective roles. The special effects may be a bit on the dated side but I still find myself watching this movie around this time of year every year. It's camp classic in vampire mythology.
0060007737|4.0|I thought this book's strengths outnumber its weaknesses in great proportions. It is very easy to read and grabs your attention for a long time. I like the style of writing, because it is not as involving as a college textbook, for example, but is still able to convey meaning by using simple words. <br /> What I found very helpful is how the authors illustrate all their statements with numerous examples. And they do it in a very familiar fashion - about businesses and companies we have all heard about. This makes the examples easy to comprehend and assimilate the message of the authors. <br /> I loved the fact that I could read some advice about business on the Internet and how to position a brand name. It is always useful to know this information, because one never knows what is coming for him in the future. <br /> The choice of wording for the heading of the book striked me at first, but then I figured that those words are very closely related to the content of the book. The authors use the word \\"immutable\\", which I did not feel comfortable with in the beginning, but after reading the book, I understood that they were trying to position \\"the brand\\" in the minds of the consumers, or readers. <br /> In general, I will remember this book for its great structure and the way the authors lay out their ideas to build up the whole picture. I will definitely remember the fact that a company should strive for its brand name to become a generic name, instead of avoiding it. <br />        I disliked the fact that the authors have stretched some of their ideas into several chapters. It would have been so much easier to combine them into one or a couple. On the other hand, may be they were trying to be as clear as possible and avoid any misunderstandings. <br />        I also did not like the fact that the authors have contradicted themselves in laws 19 (the law of consistency) and 20 (the law of change). It is understandable that every rule has an exception, but it just does not go well with the spirit of the book. Especially when the authors are trying to make a point and defend a certain position, they should be able not to undermine their own statements. <br />        In the part about Internet branding, the authors does not make it clear if the first 22 laws apply to that situation or should a business disregard them. They mention Amazon.com in a favorable manner, but this online retailer clearly violates many of the first 22 laws. <br />
B00008438V|5.0|I am a big fan of '80s teen comedies. I grew up on movies such as \\"The Breakfast Club\\", \\"Sixteen Candles\\", \\"Better Off Dead\\", and \\"Weird Science\\". Those are movies that I can constantly watch and still laugh at the sure silliness of the films. \\"Weird Science\\" is a silly premise when Anthony Michael Hall (Gary) and Ilan Mitchell Smith (Wyatt) create their perfect woman Kelly LeBrock (Lisa) with a Barbie doll and a little computer hacking. Gary and Wyatt aren't exactly popular with the girls in school so they decided to create their ideal woman one night when Wyatt's parents leave for the weekend. The results is non-stop chaos and hilarious comedy. In two days, the boys learn to become more confident in themselves and more comfortable in their own skin thanks to Lisa. I can never tire of watching this movie no matter how many times Comedy Central or any other cable network airs this movie. I can still laugh at when Chet (played by the hilarious Bill Paxton) gets turned into a Jabba the Hutt-like creature by Lisa or when the boys take the girls home. For me \\"Weird Science\\" is a timeless movie.
B00023BLXK|1.0|DDHN is a totally miserable movie to watch.  The story is flaccid and all too predictable, and the use of the Cuban Revolution in the background is forced, awkward and unbelievable.  It's just ridiculous to cast Luna in the role of a budding underground revolutionary.  The ending, with the two puppy lovers making love and then gleefully saying goodbye, is a total insult to the audience.<br /><br />Ok, so we probably didn't watch the movie for the silly plot or the unbalanced romance.  But unlike the original Dirty Dancing, which had good acting and good dancing to make it into a classic, this one lacks these sorely, too.  Nobody in this movie can really act, and the dancing feels empty and falls short of my modest expectations.  Where's the energy?  Where's the rhythm?  Where's the art?  None of those.  The two leading actors are just too young to be taken seriously in any way.<br /><br />In short, DDHN is one of those terrible movies that should not have been made.

B0006213WG|4.0|Please do not call this cd punk pop. This is not to be put on the same level as some kiddy band like simple plan. This stuff is good. It actually ROCKS. It has a beat that sometimes goes even louder  than the Ramones so you who catagorize this band in pop insult my music taste. I was looking at catagorys and they put on that level. It kills me.
B0001XTIUO|5.0|This album is a breath of fresh air away from the current crop of talentless people in the charts and headlines. An intoxicating set of songs, beautifully sung and created with real attention to detail which we haven't heard since Joni Mitchell's Court and Spark or perhaps Judee Sill's Heart Food. Sometimes one gets the sense that certain substances had been consumed - particularly on listening to the opening Chimacum Rain, Linda intones 'I'm spacing out...' - but it's really on the title track Parallelograms where we hear something wonderfully otherworldly. But the entire album is a multi-faceted gem, well worth anyone's attention. Beautiful.
B0002SROT0|4.0|Album opens up with Coast to Coast, an unexpected yet beautiful gem of a rock song from Elliott. The track has a sound to it that I have not really heard before from him, and is much heavier than most of the other material you will find on this posthumous release. <br /> Let's Get Lost is a nice song, gorgeous fingerpicking. <br /> Pretty (Ugly Before) is arguably the best written song on the album, would definitely have made the cut for a single had Elliott wished for it. <br /> Ostriches & Chirping is a pleasant prelude to Twilight, a grim, hauntingly beautiful love song. Elliott really bares his soul on this track. Listen to it when it late and you can't go to sleep. The sound of crickets will put you out in a second. <br /> Elliott's fondness of the Beatles is apparent in the next track, A Passing Feeling. I especially like the beginning. <br /> I found The Last Hour to be pretty oblique, in a good way. Elliott has these clever twists and turns that keep you in suspense as to where the song's going. <br /> Memory Lane's a decent track, certainly worth a few whirls in your CD player. <br /> A rather inconsistent album, but hey what can you expect, Elliott didn't stick around long enough to oversee how the album was put together.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Reviewers like Kevin S has done a good job taking the power away from those who read his reviews (which is repeatedly placed at different Christian publications on this site)  about this movie but not the power of the real man/God Jesus.  His atheistic view of Christ and God promotes the life after death without God which is a place called hell.  After all, a rightous God cannot keep anyone in heaven against his/her own will.  The best thing for anyone who don't believe in Christ is not to refute his divinity but remain a skeptic but NEVER be an atheist.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore has made a name for himself as the consummate documentary director, creating many movies that present his take on a critical issue and that chronicle the moods of Americans and the world at the time. Fahrenheit 9/11 continues Moore's foray into political documentaries, this time focusing on the war against Iraq and the man who got us into the mess, George W. Bush.<br /><br />Moore spends most of this documentary talking about the war, but he begins the film with a presentation on the election of 2000 and how Republicans and their colleagues helped to rig the election in favor of Bush by purging minority groups from the voter roles in Florida. Then, he quickly shifts gears to the war itself, showing the president sitting in the Florida classroom as one of his aides whispers in his ear that the U.S. is under attack.<br /><br />What follows from there is Moore's attack on the president and his war, showing how Bush and his team manipulated facts and twisted the truth to get the American people to approve the war effort. Moore makes many personal attacks on Bush and he portrays the president as having a one- track mind and as being rather stupid. One of the major criticisms of this film is how it takes things out of context, and this does appear to be a valid complaint. Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and others are shown making quotes to the camera and sometimes, they are quoted out of context. Moore includes a quote when he needs one, to drive his points home, regardless of how the quote was originally intended.<br /><br />Where this documentary succeeds most is when it sticks to the facts. The parts that talk about the phony weapons of mass destruction claim and the use of fear to sell the war to the people are among the best in the documentary. Another thing that keeps the movie entertaining is Moore's sarcastic wit. One of the funniest moments in the film comes when Moore decides to drive an ice cream truck around the U.S. Capital and read the provisions of the anti Patriot Act through a loudspeaker. He does this after learning (accurately) that most of the people in congress voted for this anti- liberty measure without even bothering to read it.<br /><br />Besides the quotes taken out of context and the attempts to make Bush look either like a complete fool or a cold, uncaring villain, there are a few other things I didn't care for. I didn't like the sidetracking by Moore, such as when he shows scenes of abandoned businesses and houses from his hometown of Flint, Michigan- similar to what was shown in his first documentary, Roger and Me. And I felt he got a little carried away with Lila Lipscomb and her concerns about young people going off to war. This adds some good drama to the film, but I would prefer if he stuck with the facts.<br /><br />Fahrenheit 9/11 is a pretty good documentary even though it's obviously one- sided and gives no opportunities for any opposing viewpoints. Many people are angered at Moore for making this documentary while others applaud his efforts with great enthusiasm. Whatever position you take, you should still take some time out to watch this documentary. It shows how a group of people can successfully manipulate the truth and then add a dose of fear to the equation to convince millions of people that armed conflict is necessary and moral.he anti Patriot Act through a loudspeaker.

B00005JMJG|5.0|I was caught off guard by this movie. I was moved to buy it. I was hit blindside by a train.<br /><br />This movie pulls off what most modern movies don't: characters you actually care about, and want to learn move about. Carrey is stunning, and Winslet pulls off her \\"easy to love and hate at the same time\\" multi-colored hair troubled woman with an amazing performance. I fell in love with Carrey and Winslet. I wanted a happy ending, and received one. No cheesy Hollywood love storie here. No cookie cutter script. Just acting that leaves you in tears.<br /><br />Brilliant. Rent it, and then buy it. While I was not a fan of Being John Malkovich, or Adaptation, because of their dry cardboard characters, this movie flies to the other end of the character spectrum and sets a wonderful standard.<br /><br />This movie leaves you yearning to jump into the film. There is no greater compliment than this.
B000089CG8|5.0|I will never understand the logic that would lead a recording company to spend a vast amount of money on a recording project, and one that turns out to be outstandingly successful, only to let the end result languish unreleased for a dozen years.  What do they think it is, a rare Cabernet Sauvignon? <br /> <br />Hint to the recording companies:  If it's good, which this certainly is, it won't get better by letting it age in the vault.  It ain't wine. <br /> <br />That said, this is simply a marvelous recording.  Obviously, it is not alone in the catalog.  But it does move to the top.  I'm old enough to remember regretting it when Ashkenazy began moving into conducting, purely for the selfish reason that I didn't want him to spare a single moment away from the keyboard for other disciplines. <br /> <br />I was wrong.

0446614459|3.0|I must have been spoiled by Baldacci's prior novels. I've read them all and he's one of my favorite authors. But Split Second isn't up to his usual standards. The characters aren't as strong and the story seems to drag in places. All in all, it was a disappointment.
B00006JDS4|5.0|This is one of the most shocking movies I've ever seen.  probably as shocking as Cannibal Holocaust, although totally different genres and themes.

I doubt many people have.  I'm not gonna spoil the movie for anyone by telling you the whole story, but watch this if you want to see something out of the ordinary.
B00008RH1H|5.0|<br />             One man's life with full of ups and downs is pictured in the film, \\"The Throne of Blood\\", directed by Akira Kurosawa. This film is a Japanese re-make version of the famous Shakespearean play, Macbeth. Because this film is a Japanese film, many details differ from Macbeth, although the basic plot of the story is the same. All the plot changes, character and setting differences are effective choices for this film because it adds a different taste to the original form of the story.  <br /> Most plot changes in the film due to cultural differences make the plot in this film natural and flowing, with a little twist at the end. Some detailed plot adaptations that the director had to make included Washizu (playing the role of Macbeth) taking over the Cob-web castle, Miki (playing the role of Lady Macbeth) being pregnant and Washizu being killed by his own men towards the end of the story. In medieval Japan, a man taking over a castle did not necessarily mean that he can be the Emperor of Japan, unlike Macbeth aiming to be the King from the start. Therefore, Washizu did not kill the Emperor, but he had to kill the others competing for the castle. However, the conflicts between Washizu and the other competent is similar to Macbeth's because the goal that they both had in mind was to achieve power. In this film, Miki's pregnancy does not seem to have a dramatical change in the plot of the story, but is thought to be necessary for this Japanese film. The reason for this is because the couple wanted their own child  to inherit his throne after his death. This inheriting system is similar to the one in Macbeth, but this director decided to add this detail in to reveal the great desires of Washizu. After all of the killing and the struggles to take over the castle, Washizu did not want any other person but his child who shares his blood to inherit the throne. The climax of this film comes when hundreds of soldiers by Washizu's side points their arrows at him and one by one hits him. This is another plot adaptations that has been made for this film because the soldiers wanted to show the sign of surrender. Giving Washizu's head represented surrender. This change made the film more violent thus added a twist with an unexpected ending. In making changes, it is very important that the plot flows and that it is natural. This sort of change is needed because there is no fun in a film or story that is completely same from the original form.  <br /> The main character, Washizu is very different from the characteristic that Macbeth has. Washizu is brave, confident, demanding and more selfish than the Shakespearean Macbeth. A Shogun (similar position as the Thane when referring to Macbeth) has to be strong, determined and brave to take over a castle. Unlike Macbeth, he was demanding his wife and the tone of his speech was overall strong. The director probably wanted to express the image of a brave man going through one straight road towards his goal, but ending with a tragic death. This is maybe a typical image of a Shogun during the medieval Japan. One thing that is not expressed because of this characterization of Washizu, is the gradual change of Washizu the beginning to the end of the story.  This is an important change to express because in Macbeth, he is growing to become more aggressive and greedy as he overcomes the obstacles to become the King. Similarly, Miki's characterization is different form Lady Macbeth too. Lady Macbeth was a pretty strong woman, telling her husband what to do. However, Miki was not like her because she was under a circumstance where she cannot, since Washizu was a demanding person. But overall, the two characters played the Japanese actors were very well suited for this version of Macbeth.  <br /> \\"The Throne of Blood\\" was set in medieval Japan, when Shoguns from each castle fought to prove the strongest castle and warlords. this setting is very suited to fit a story like Macbeth into. Both setting has Lords, Emperor/King, and warriors. This made it possible for details to be expressed in the film. An example of one detail is one of the three apparitions that the old lady, gave to Washizu. When the old lady told him that he will be victorious unless the wood nears the neighbor comes down to Washizu's castle. Since medieval castle in Japan were constructed on the top of the fort and used forests and woods as one of the protection and security methods, this apparition was realistic. The director chose Japan as the setting of this film, probably because many things matched with the original setting. Technically, it is a completely different setting but it is good enough to reproduce a similar story which is very impressive.  <br /> If people who have never seen or heard about Macbeth happens to see \\"The Throne of Blood\\" will not think that this film is a reproductive of a Shakespearean play. This is how almost perfectly Macbeth and The Throne of Blood matches. The changes were made rather to improve the film. Washizu and Macbeth, both who lived a fast and tragic life possess a lifestyle that people today can still learn and achieve from. That is the power of films and stories. \\"The Throne of Blood\\" will always be the classical and perfect example of a successful reproductive film.  <br />
B00005Q5WC|5.0|The original version of this album was the album which sparked my obsession with Bob Marley & the Wailers in the Spring of 2002 and I now own all the albums and know nearly all there is to know about my fallen hero.  This album is phenomonal boasting the most hits on a single album in his entire career.  Each song is a song for the ages from \\"Natural Mystic\\" to \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\".  This album promises to deliver everything both the hardcore and casual fan could want and more with each powerful, life-changing song. <br /> <br />The deluxe edition promises even more phenomonal work with rare classics like \\"Roots\\" and \\"Punky Reggae Party,\\" as well as an unreleased version of \\"Keep On Moving,\\" with several remixes and an excerpt from a concert to boot.  If you purchase this album, I can guarentee you will not be disappointed.  You'll find yourself listening to it time and time again.
B0006399FS|4.0|After what seemed like an endless wait for a new U2 album, it is finally here, and while it could have been better, it certainly could have been much worse. After the first listen through, my reaction was \\"where are the rock-n-roll songs?\\" I was under the impression that this was going to be U2 going back to their roots, a more upbeat rock-n-roll sound to the album. Sure \\"Vertigo\\" has a great beat, but if you are expecting the album to be like that single, you are in for a shock. Instead we get a more mellow sound, as if this is a transitional album. After listening to it more, I have found that I am enjoying it much more than their last album (however, \\"Walk On\\" is one superb song). While this album doesn't come close to \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" or \\"Joshua Tree\\", it is well worth the price, and over time will probably grow on us all.  <br />  Looking forward to the tour early next year, just hope we don't have to wait another five years for another offering by one of the greatest bands in the world. :-)
B0006399FS|2.0|A weak album. Bono's voice is on leave in order to keep smoking. <br />It would have been if HTDAAB were included Fast Cars and Mercy, rather One Step Closer and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. <br />U2 dare not try a new experimental music way, that's clear here.  <br />I really want they to stop all these safe albums.  <br />U2 can sleep for 4 years, re-make some ATYCLB outtakes and release that stuff as \\"the best U2 album\\" because of deaf and blind fans.  <br />This weak album is a deception, indeed. They disgrace their career with these \\"albums\\" ( talking about ATYCLB and this one ). Now I know why this album is known as ATYCLB II, literally. This crude delivery will pay Bono's drinks and smokes, and some kids will be happy for that...
0393035158|5.0|I think Harris puts together a very convincing argument, especially in the light of the recent presidential election. The quote for presidential election \\"In our next presedential election an actor who reads the bible would almost certainly defeat a rocket scientist who doesn't\\" pretty much says it all. What Harris lacks in consistency sometimes he makes up in sharpness of his arguments and in well placed witticisms and sarcasm. Highly recommend this for a serious skeptical reader.
B00005JMUL|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the year. Not only does it have a heartfelt story, but it is visually amazing. The other computer generated image movies that came out this year were \\"Shrek 2\\" and \\"The Incredibles.\\" The difference between the three movies is that \\"The Polar Express\\" took of picture of Tom Hanks, who plays about five different parts, and then they animated the picture of it. The people characters all look realistic, and the movie could give the impression of a life action film. What I love about animation is that you can do anything, and this movie creates it's own world. It reminded me of \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Instead of a girl, it was a boy, and he enters a magic land full of new adventures and new friends. \\"The Polar Express\\" is also based on a children's book of the same name. I never read the book, or heard of it before the movie came out, but I heard that the movie is as good as the book. It is hard to make a movie version of a 40 page book, and alot of people were disappointed with the movie version of \\"The Cat in the Hat.\\" I'll have to look in the store for this book and flip through it there. Tom Hanks is having a very good year, with \\"The Ladykillers\\" and \\"The Terminal\\" all getting five stars from me. I just wanted to take in all of this animation, and enter this world, and I haven't been so impressed with animation since last years \\"Finding Nemo.\\" I'm just looking forward for the next technological leap in animation. <br /> <br />The movie begins with the young Hero Boy sleeping in his bed, waiting for Santa. He is at that age where he is beginning to doubt if Santa is real or not. As he is lying in bed, a train pulls up in front of the house, and The Conductor asks if he is coming on board. Hesitating, the boy gets on and meets the Hero Girl, and the Know It All. Know It All is that kind of kid where everything that he says sounds like he thinks he is better than everybody else. He probably doesn't mean it, but he gives that impression. They are going to the North Pole, for it is Christmas Eve, and on the way, after picking up young Billy, they go through many adventures, including riding on ice, going down Glaciar Gulp, which is the steepest mountain in the North Pole, and finally making it to the North Pole. Along the way, the Hero Boy also meets the Hobo who lives on the top of the train, who is a ghost that whenever he disappears, one of his hands always lingers. When they make it to the North Pole, it's not all smooth sailing, and they meet the elves, who run a very tight organized layout, and get to see the Christmas Eve ceremony.  <br /> <br />\\"The Polar Express\\" is always entertaining, and you can't take your eyes off the screen. I have to compare it to \\"The Incredibles\\" because that is the other big animated movie of the season. \\"The Polar Express\\" is Rated G, as opposed to the PG that \\"The Incredibles\\" has, but this movie is much more darker. There is not a bright tropical island, with the little boy fighting other super villians, instead it is a much more sober tale about believing. The Hero Boy doesn't really believe, and I loved the way to believe. The Boy doesn't get all the perks that everybody else does. For example, he can't hear the sleigh bells, because he doesn't really believe that they are there. He believes he is in a dream for a short period of time. I found this movie to be more entertaining than \\"The Incredibles\\" and much more visually stunning, even though I gave both movies five stars. Tom Hanks played the voice over of the Hero Boy, The Hobo, The Conductor, The Boy's father, and even Santa Claus himself. This is the best Christmas movie of the year as well, and beats \\"Surviving Christmas\\" and \\"Christmas with the Kranks\\" combined. I wanted to thank every person in the credits personally. The slight thing I didn't like was when Hero Girl and Billy had to sing that sappy Christmas song. It did slow the movie down a little, kind of like \\"If I Were the King of the Forest\\" in \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" It broke the mood of the story, and if that was cut I wouldn't have minded. <br /> <br />I saw \\"The Polar Express\\" twice. I saw it on opening day on the regular screen, and then I decided to see it on IMAX, otherwise I would have reviewed this already. I recommend the IMAX version more. It is on a much bigger screen, and it is in 3D. It was like riding a roller coaster, and I was able to study the animation more clearly with the crystal clear screens. I don't wear my glasses often, but I can see that the 3D glasses were much more bigger to cover the glasses as well. It was great seeing some of my favorite scenes on the IMAX, including the journey of the train ticket over mountain, and in a birds nest, and especially the train riding on the ice, I won't say anymore. I loved the music of the movie, as well, and it provded such a sweet and sad undertone, which touches the heart of the movie. I wanted to cry during the very last line of the movie, both times I saw it. It's very happy, but subtitling sad, and it was then when I knew that \\"The Polar Express\\" would be close to the top of the Best of 2004. <br /> <br />ENJOY! <br /> <br />Rated G
B00003CXBK|5.0|To Soccer75... <br /> <br />PG-13 means that it's for people aged 13 and above. It is implied that people of those ages are mature enough to understand and handle the content within. It's NOT FOR JUNIOR. Don't blame whoever decided on the rating for your inattentiveness. <br /> <br />Also, do the words \\"fairy tale\\" or \\"myth\\" mean anything to you? <br /> <br />In short, please take your closed mind elsewhere. <br /> <br />----------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />Anyways, this is perfect fare to be watched on the computer with a pair of headphones on. As was stated above, this has a PG-13 rating FOR A REASON. Even I, a mature young woman of 19 years, was disgusted at points by the gore. If you have a young child into anime, try lighter fare like some of the things shown on Cartoon Network's Toonami block, dubbed Sailor Moon, or Code LYOKO. <br /> <br />For folks still hanging around, there's lush visuals, beautiful audio, and decent voiceacting to be enjoyed (headphones!), as well as a wonderful story told through those mediums. Wolves, apes, cute little rattle-head thingies, and boars abound, some playing pivotal roles. Bonds of trust and loyalty are shown. There is love, hate, and compassion all woven in. Everything flows together wonderfully. <br /> <br />If you can get over the violence (and have an open mind), this is definitely one to see. I for one enjoyed it.
B000002HHB|4.0|Tis true that Natalie's style and voice are melodic, sometimes mesmerizing and unusual, but let's not forget her band and the quality of the musicians. I always listen beyond the upfront vocalist for the quality of the lead guitarist, the drummer or the bass guitarist, etc.. One of the primary reasons that I purchased this CD was because of the melodious and foot-tapping guitar playing of Jennifer Turner. Her style and play is as smooth and satisfying as a Mint Julip. Who says a lady cannot play an axe as good as or better than a man? Just listening to her lead-ins and riffs is as stimulating and refreshing as an early Spring rainshower.
B00005JN0T|2.0|Smith has shown once again that he can only play one role - that of a disrespectful punk who grates on everyone's nerves.  Asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now.  The special effects were good, but the acting was not.  Chi McBride was great, and Bridget Moynihan did well, but Smith just reinforced the fact that he can't handle any role that doesn't exactly reflect his own personality and demeanor.  I hope that some director in the future tries to cast Smith in a role that wasn't written for him - then we will all see that he really can't act his way out of a wet paper bag. <br /> <br />Don't buy this on DVD - wait for it to come out on one of the cable movie channels...

0679428895|4.0|Being a history buff with a particular interest in ancient Rome Pompeii was a \\"must read\\" for me. In the tradition of Colleen MacCullough, it gives the reader a taste of the Roman world that is coupled with a potential \\"disaster\\" movie. The novel is peppered with descriptions of life in a provincial town, the engineering and importance of the Roman aquaducts, an ambitious but dedicated engineer on the trail of corruption and revelations of nature's awesome power, a portrayal of the historical Pliny observing the eruption,  a strong dose of Roman corruption and decadence, a harrowing tale of the eruption of Vesuvius,and even a budding love story with a heroic, but mystical finish. It is plodding at times during the first two-thirds with its emphasis on the repair of the aquaduct. However, the build-up to the eruption gives the reader a bit of a sixth sense as the characters step on and off stage. Pompeii is one of those historical events that almost everybody knows about in a superficial way and this novel brings the town  as it existed and subsequent destruction to life. However, some readers will get bogged down and frustrated early and may put Pompeii aside. My advice is to push on and you will not be dissappointed.
B00006CXGM|5.0|If, as currently seems possible, Guy Ritchie's career as a director of unconventional British crime movies has come to a premature conclusion, it's truly a great loss for the film world.  In his first two movies, Ritchie created a pair of classics that effectively mixed action, comedy, and intrigue with a flair the likes of which you'll rarely find.  With Snatch, he succeeded for the second time at crafting a gangster flick filled with colorful characters and bizarre happenings and managing to be rather original in the process.  Sure, fans of Quentin Tarantino will recognize the disjointed time frame, violent excess and general amorality present in Ritchie's films, but Ritchie outdoes his American counterpart in his committment to lightning-fast pacing and outrageous humor.  This guy is truly a visual stylist of the highest order.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch concerns gangsters and thievery in the less reputable sections of London, and like its predecessor Snatch is a hyperactive roller coaster ride of a movie that replaces the deep gravity of such old-time gangster flicks as the Godfather with Ritchie's stylized violence and offbeat characterizations.  Right from the opening scene, when a gang led by the aptly named Franky Four Fingers stages a daring jewelry heist while dressed as a group of Hasidic Jews, this movie offers the promise of something different, and it more than delivers.  For most of its running time Snatch borders on sheer sensory overload, with Ritchie's camera cutting constantly and the laughs coming as fast as the bodies pile up.  Bullets, fists, and profanities all fly as a seemingly endless number of plot strands come together, leading up to a blood-soaked finale that makes the conclusion of a John Woo movie seem almost tame by comparison.<br /><br />Despite everything I've written above, it's really the dialogue and characterization that elevate Snatch above the crime-movie plain.  This movie doesn't just show you a bunch of colorful criminal types, it actually manages to make you like some of them, although maybe not always for the best reasons.  Here Ritchie assembled an extremely diverse ensemble cast, and it's one filled with memorable and perfectly portrayed figures ranging from a shady unlicensed boxing promoter to a legendary thug with two bullets for teeth to a local mob kingpin with a highly unusual method of disposing of victims.  Of course, it's the surprise casting of Brad Pitt that raised a lot of eyebrows when this movie came out, and with good reason.  Pitt strays far from his typical fare with his portrayal of a fast-talking gypsy boxing champ, but he's note-perfect in his role, right down to his semi-intelligible accent.  Ever since I watched Seven and Fight Club years ago, I've thought Pitt was an excellent character actor who just happened to be a star, and this movie only served to confirm that impression.  Vinnie Jones is once again brilliant as well in his role as Bullet Tooth Tony, even if his calm-and-collected-one-minute-raving-lunatic-the-next role isn't much of a stretch from his work in Lock, Stock.<br /><br />Throughout its relatively brief running time, Snatch never lets up its frenetic pace, ensuring that even those possessed of the shortest attention spans won't wind up bored.  Now, as many have noted, Snatch isn't much of a depature from Ritchie's first film, right down to the repeated casting of Jason Statham in a leading role.  That fact notwithstanding, though, there's something to be said for staying in the same niche, especially when that niche isn't exactly being filled by too many other people at the moment.  Anyone who can churn out such distinctive and entertaining movies should be welcomed, regardless of such piddling complaints as repetitiveness.

B000001E18|3.0|U2's 1993 \\"Zooropa\\" never grabbed me the way other releases have, which is why I give it three stars instead of four. It's good, but just not a disk I find myself reaching for when I hit my U2 catalog. The songs are largely experimental, with lots of synths, samples, tape loops and ironic lyrics. U2 were at the top of the heap, so they went for a hipster image that to me didn't really work.<br /><br />The opener, \\"Zooropa\\" features nearly two minutes of quiet instrumental build before the tune begins. I like the song and tempo change, but it could undergo a substantial edit.<br /><br />\\"Babyface\\" is more beat than melody, as are a number of songs here, so one could say that Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton get to stretch a bit, but it has always been The Edge's guitars that carried their music. \\"Numb\\" is a novelty piece with distorted guitars, space invaders sound effects, and The Edge's monotone spoken word lyrics, with Bono hovering in the background. It's interesting the first few times, but not a tune you want to listen to over and over.<br /><br />\\"Lemon\\" is the most techno-disco of the bunch, and possibly the most commercial of the set. Bono hits an amazing falsetto on his vocal. \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\" is one of the better songs on the disk, with interesting lyrical imagery, but still lacks the impact of \\"With or Without You\\" or \\"One\\" from previous releases. \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay...\\" has a good bass/drum groove, as does \\"Some Days are Better Than Others.\\"<br /><br />U2 usually place a spiritual meditative piece as the last song, and this time out it's \\"The Wanderer.\\" If you heard this on the radio, you would never know this was U2, since the lead vocal is by Johnny Cash, but it's a moving performance.

0140277447|2.0|Chang's book, from a historical perspective, is full of errors, which the revisionists have used to their delight to claim the atrocity is fake. It is not, but her book is a very mixed blessing and she did not do a good historical job. Her book is still important and deserves mention for 2 historiographical reasons: 1) Her book single handedly gave the incident a new life in the eyes of the overseas Chinese community and the Western world at large. This has glavanized researchers and produced more work on the issue. 2) Her book uses the Rabe diaries which has moved the research forward. Her effective use of the Rabe account, which I seem to recall her finding (?) is very important.

B0002KVULG|5.0|Although this story is slightly different than Bram Stoker's novel, it is, by far, my favorite rendition of the the story due to Mr. Langella's portrayal of the 'Count'. <br />I especially enjoyed the scene in which Count Dracula invites 'Lucy' for dinner to Carfax Abbey.  As she walks into the 'dining room' I was blown away by the lighting effects and scenic effects of a run down castle. <br />And speaking about effects, the 'love scene' was indeed as romantic as any could imagine a love scene to be with a blood sucking vampire and a fair maiden.  Mr. Langella stole my heart at that scene in the 1970's as he has continued to do since. <br />I applaud John Badham for this version of the story where we see minimal 'blood and guts' in a 'blood and guts' story.  Of course, it was before the 'slasher' movies reigned, but are those slasher movies able to stand up now as they did when they first came out on the 'big screen'?   <br />Mr. Badham has made a first rate, dark, frightening story which has been and will always be my favorite 'Dracula' for all time. <br />Love,Love,Love!!! <br />
B000000HU1|4.0|This is the third part of the Radio Gnome trilogy of albums released by Gong in the early to mid 70's. Like George Clinton's creations with Parliament, the concept is starting to lose it's appeal towards the end of the series and the Radio Gnome concept plays very much a back-seat role on this one. It's the sidemen who star on \\"You\\", leaving Daevid Allen's short pieces in the shade as they take the space rock developed on \\"Flying Teapot\\" and \\"Angel's Egg\\" to a new level. The best tracks on this LP are the 3 loooong tracks \\"Master Builder\\", \\"A sprinkling of clouds\\" and \\"Isle of Everywhere\\". These show that the interaction between the musicians had developed to an incredible degree. The jolting but tight rhythms of \\"Isle of Everywhere\\" and the slow burning \\"Sprinkling of Clouds\\" are worth the price of admission by themselves, and blow almost all other progressive/space/art rock recorded in the 70s to pieces. Pink Floyd? Who cares. <br /> <br />While it lacks the overall cohesion of the other two and drifts off at the end in a dissappointing fade out rather than an exciting finale, \\"You\\" is still worth getting. After this Gong became bombastic jazz-rock with the emphasis on the rock. The subtlety of the music was lost and it never came back. <br /> <br />For anyone who gets really hooked on this period of Gong (and it isn't hard believe me) - check out the live recordings \\"Live Etc\\", \\"Live at Sheffield\\" and the \\"Post-Modernist Radio BBC sessions\\" for examples of just how good this band were at their peak. Some of the silliness of the studio recordings is done away with and you are just left with the music, which for some parts is all you need.

Great performances by artists who actually sing! (novel idea in this day and age) Highlights abound. The complete sets of Queen and U2, Chrissy Hynde in top form, The WHO with Kenny Jones on drums and a great set from the Style Council (Rare for us Americans.) No complaints really. Just some wonderful music and some wonderful memories. I guess all of us would have liked to see the complete performances but we should be thankful for this set and remember why this event took place at all.

0064407667|5.0|I started reading this book because I heard so much about the series and a good book to read while waithing for Harry Potter book 6.  Now, I never read something so sad in my life and I have been living for 33 years already.  it is a fast read and good read for kids.  I actually cry reading this book but it is totally well written.  Not sure what the age recommendation on the book but it is pretty grim.  So Parents read the book before you give it to your kids.  NOthing to object from except it might be a bit too sad for young readers.
0060977493|1.0|Reading Arundhati Roy's effort is an uphill endeavour.  Illustrated here is the ever recurring limitation of 98% of novels as an art form: saying very little - and at length.  <br /> <br />Mere crumbs of insight - surrounded by repetition, waffle and padding. <br /> <br />In telling the story of a family and others struck by tragic events, the style is flowery, over-written and relentlessly irritating.  If it is a point-of-view narrative device, it fails.  If the novel is allegory then it's a glib attempt. The ornate Dylan Thomas-like stylistic devices bog the whole ponderous venture down.  Get on with it women!  Life's too short for this bombastic exercise in the superficial. You just want to get to the end and write the whole purchase off as the mistake that it is. <br /> <br />No surprise that it fooled the Man-Booker's judges - all too keen to grab the opportunity to give the prize to an Indian (and a female). <br /> <br />Bharat is forever trapped and enslaved by a stodgy mind set.  A permanently old fashioned, stilted outlook (note: `Dadi', `Dada', `Mammachi', `Pappachi').  This novel reveals that its younger generation remain still imprisoned by lack of clear thinking, sentimental day dreaming and worship of the extended family unit as a god. <br /> <br />A god of small talents surely smiled on this novel.
B00012QM9K|5.0|This film is based on a book, and in that book, unbelievable depth is given to many many characters.  Relationships are explained and families traced back and forth throughout the various cities and camps.  One movie could not possibly replicate the depth of the book.  In saying that, Spielberg has done a tremendous job capturing the emotion of the book and highlighting some relationship in order to tell the story.  This movie should not be missed, not only for the story told, but for the artful use of black and white film-making and the emotion is conveys
B00065JTBA|1.0|....not every single B-side is on this CD (at least not listed, anyway). There was a song called \\"Love Is War\\" which was the B-side of the \\"Living In Sin\\" 45 single from 1989. In my opinion, it was, perhaps, one of the best songs Bon Jovi ever recorded. Is this the hidden track I've heard about? And does anyone else remember it as well? This isn't a review, since I have yet to hear this collection, but I wonder why it isn't listed. Would appreciate some clarification on this. Other than that,I think putting out all (or most of ) their previously unreleased and obscure catalog is a great idea. Like finding undiscovered buried treasure. Hopefully it's better than the dreck they're putting out now.

0060512806|5.0|Why was this book one of my alltime favorites? A few reasons: <br /> <br />1) Attention to Detail - This is not a light read or one for the faint of heart. It shifts time periods, places and characters at the speed of light. On the other hand, great detail is given to each time period, location and character as they are developed. <br /> <br />2) Great plot - The book weaves together a great plot of intrigue...including murders, mysteries, great adventures and a tangled weave of relationships. <br /> <br />3) Great writing - The writing is superb...as long as you can keep everything straight. <br /> <br />4) Great character/character development - The author does a great job of introducing characters and developing them without spending all of his words telling us what the character is thinking. Development happens in the flow of the story and creates a web of characters who are all related, even across generations and the globe. <br /> <br />5) Geek factor - There is some math and technology in here that may throw off the 'non-geek' reader. However, if you're not a geek, just ignore the math and move on. If you are a geek, get out some paper and play with the equations a little. There's no new ground covered here; it's pretty simple. <br /> <br />My only regret is that there's not a followup...which would probably ruin it anyway. :-)

B0002XVSRE|4.0|The only reason I can think of for buying this CD is the extra song, \\"Fast Cars,\\" which is not on the American release.  It's a great song, too.  I'm not that big a fan of the album itself; there are several great songs, but also a few lackluster songs, so it's a bit of a mixed bag.  \\"Fast Cars\\" is a standout, though, AND it's the song from which the album draws its title.  I'd suggest buying the AMerican release, and then going to iTunes and buying the less-than-a-dollar \\"Fast Cars.\\"  Then you can make your very own version of this import, and have spent considerably less. <br /> <br />Great song, though, no doubt about that.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2's latest \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is a collection of sounds and lyrics that invites us to reflect and to somewhat \\"dismantle\\" our views about death, repentance, ignorance, and love.   <br /> <br />The album follows an arch from begining to end.  From the chaotic and powerful \\"Vertigo\\" to the peaceful and hopeful \\"Yahweh\\", the album expresses thoughts that are so passionate and touching that you will find yourself crying and smiling as you pick each lyric apart and carry melodies in your head.  Each day you will have a favorite tune.  The album is that good. <br /> <br />Vertigo---a classic from the start.  Pure rock and roll. <br /> <br />Miracle Drug--beautiful melody and hopeful lyrics. <br /> <br />Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own--a touching tribute to Bono's dad--sang at his funeral.  It fits all types of relationships that are going through a struggle.  A classic. <br /> <br />Love, Peace of Else---I call this the \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" song on this album. <br /> <br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\"---awesome touching lyrics, memorable melody. <br /> <br />\\"All Because of You\\"---their next single.  Just good old Rock and Roll. <br /> <br />\\"A Man and A Woman\\"--this song sounds like it could easily fit in the \\"Unforgetable Fire\\" album.  A deep thought about the mystery of what makes us what we are. <br /> <br />\\"Crumbs from your Table\\"---a song about pleading for more in a relationship.  When you feel you only get just so much out of someone but not everything. <br /> <br />\\"One Step Closer\\"---a wiser look at life in general.  As we grow older, we get wiser.  Great! <br /> <br />\\"Origin of the Species\\"---if you know someone who is in a rush to grow up...a daughter or son....great song about appreciating life now since it is so short. <br /> <br />\\"Yahweh\\"--a classic U2 theme...hope and passion that a higher force such as God could change our lives if we surrender ourselves. <br /> <br />\\"Fast Cars\\"--this song is on my Limited Edition.  A great Spanish/flamenco influenced Rock and Rock song.  Great fun. <br /> <br />This album takes U2 back to the basics of their sound...memorable melodies, great guitar riffs, touching lyrics, and the message that hope is not lost when our world, family and relationships seem to be falling apart. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|2.0|.....because the rest of the album is Norah Jones-style sleepiness.  Wow, what a letdown.  Vertigo rocks out; then they phone in the rest of the \\"songs.\\"  Vertigo is the only tune that is even remotely engaging.  Can anyone REALLY tell when the other tunes begin and end?  I can't. <br /> <br />Oh, PLEASE don't buy the $30+ CD/DVD package.  The book that is enclosed is nothing but random drawings that can't be understood and the handwriting can't be read.  Now I don't even have a jewel case to store the CD in. <br /> <br />Save your money!  Borrow a copy from a friend and listen to it first! <br /> <br />
B000002JSP|2.0|This is the first and only  Zeppelin album that is completely<br />void of any ripp offs - ( of blues artists ,contemporaries , or acoutic masters like Bert Jansch and Davey Graham ). Its Led Zeppelin left to their own devices... and it shows. The album starts off really strong with In The Evening - great song. The 3rd track Fool In The Rain is kind of a fun pop song - pretty good tune . Unfortunately the festivities end there. The rest of this album is a musical exploration into mediocrity. The song All My Love is 100% certified crap. If youre Michael Bolton its a work of art. If youre Led Zepp its a cry for help. Im Gonna<br />Crawl ... This is what Zeppelin sounds like trying to write a blues song ... without the help of Wilie Dixon , Muddy Waters or the host of other bluesmen they \\" borrowed \\" from . Anyway, the point is this is very dissapointing album especially comming off a 3 year wait from Presence.. which was a pretty decent album.
0395389496|5.0|If your children like Christmas stories, they're going to love 'The Polar Express.'  The story is wonderful and the art is absolutely magical.  I have a library copy that my daughter makes me read to her every day or so.  I guess I'll have to buy a copy when this one goes back to the library.  Either that, or I'll have to pay hideous overdue fines, as I'm reasonably certain we'll have to keep this book in the house until my princess grows beyond such things.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Instead of reviewing this album, like I wish I could, I'm just too tempted to respond to that \\"kid\\" Meggie, who wrote a review..that was based on...well...nothing. <br /> <br />Again, a review is based upon something you have heard. Her reasons for not buying this album is similar to the reasons that the other 1 star reviewers gave: his personal life. May I stress that his personal life has affected his music, and therefore, his personal life must be grand because he has grand music. His personal life is misunderstood, but we obviously don't need a  kid to come on here, and bring up silly rumors that made me pee in my pants. Hahha... she says MJ has green blood? His nose? His face? His wife? That affects the great songs he has produced? That affects the music he has helped us enjoy: his new music: Wev'e Had Enough, THe Way You Love  Me, Beautiful Girl, Fall Again. They are all great. But again, a gullable person must always take a piece of chocolate pie, and choke on it, regurgitating desperate attempts to bring the reigining king of music: Michael Jackson. And therefore Meggie, sweetie, honey-pie, I marked your review has \\"not helpful\\" and reported it to Amazon.com.
0385513755|4.0|'The Da Vinci Code' is an old-fashioned page-turner.  Although the fiendishly-difficult puzzles in the story aren't all that fiendish (or even particularly difficult), the plot moves like a runaway train.  Intrigue, murder, history, art, religion, and conspiracy...  What more could a reader ask for?  There's even a sex cult.  (Okay, it's a pagan fertility cult and the sex takes place off-camera, but it's the thought that counts.)  Dan Brown does a wonderful job bundling a series of diverse historical events into a coherent and believable story, populated with compelling characters.  The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and the bumbling cops are... well... bumbling.<br /><br />I'd love to give this book five stars, but I can't.  The historical `facts' are bent a bit too far for the sake of the story, and one recurring plot device reminded me unpleasantly of that trick that children love to play at Christmas: the large and colorfully wrapped box, which contains a smaller box, which contains a smaller box...  Although watching the victim open box after box seems endlessly entertaining to the 11 year old perpetrator of the gag, the game is a bit tiresome after the second box.  By the time you get to the last tiny box at the center, whatever present it contains will almost certainly fail to justify the effort.<br /><br />Those quibbles aside, however, `The Da Vinci Code' is a lot of fun.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"
B00005QAPH|5.0|Wow.  Wow.  Double Wow.  I was unsure what I was about to indulge myself in when I first picked up this film.  Foreign, Fellini, and Oscar were all that I knew about this mythological film.  I had read about it in books, read reviews of it on top ten lists, but never found myself in the same room as it.  I wanted to see this so passionately that when it arrived I immediately popped it into my player and began watching it.  What I witnessed was like a drug on the brain.  The images, the story, the sheer brilliance and force behind the crafty eye of Fellini brought me deeper into this film than any other I have seen.  This is not easy for me to say because I have seen tons of films in my lifetime, but this film really takes the cake.  The brilliant black and white photography, the powerful ear-gobbling music, and the acting - Marcello Mastroianni controls this film.  You cannot seem to get your eyes off his scenes.  All of these elements create an innovative, provocative film based loosely on the life of Fellini, but also about the competitive and dragging world of film creation.<br /><br />From the opening scene, the tone is set in this film.  As we see Guido (Mastroianni) trying to escape a smoking car while nobody tries to help, we are captured.  The senses are heightened, and claustrophobia sets in and never leaves throughout the rest of the film.  Fellini has trapped us into this character and is beginning our roller-coaster ride known as Guido's life.  As we meet the rest of the characters, that looming claustrophobia continues to stay with us.  We add to this grab bag of emotions the struggle that Guido has with women, the stress pressures of completing a film that he has no clue how to start.  The only idea he has deals with a large structure that seems to keep the producers at bay.  Couple with this his struggling childhood memories of women and the angry power of his wife.  It is hard not to be involved with Guido throughout the course of this film because of these intense emotions that Fellini has fed to us.<br /><br />Outside of the emotional aspects of this film, it is beautifully directed.  Fellini pulls no stops (nor does Criterion) in the creation of this film.  The music, the actors, and even the beauty of the random, chaotic scene works to perfection everytime.  This is not a film you can sit down and enjoy once, it is definitely one that needs to be played over and over again.  In the film Sideways, Giamatti's character talks about wine being \\"never the same each time you drink it\\".  Each sip produces a new flavor and even if you open another bottle of the same, it may not be able to replicate the same exact taste.  That is how I feel about this film.  The first time I watched it, I was oblivious to the surroundings and the sub-stories.  I was so engulfed with Guido that I couldn't keep my eyes off him.  If I were to watch 8 ½ again, focusing on a different aspect, I am sure to see a different film than I originally saw.  That is the greatness of Fellini, he directs so that each time you watch you are constantly seeing something new.  I saw that with his film Juliet of the Spirits as well.  I am not as voiced in Fellini as I should be, but these two films have proved that I need to see more and more of his work.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that I enjoyed this film for a direct reason.  You don't see this technique used in many Hollywood films today, and I think that is why it caught my eye in Fellini's masterpiece.  You could be sitting in a room full of friends and family, and honestly each person in the room (as the final credits ran) would say that they saw a different film than what you thought.  It is like going into an art museum for the first time.  You can all look at the same visions, but it is how you perceive these visions that makes it a great piece of art.  Fellini did this with 8 ½.  I don't know if it was on purpose, or if he had a direct vision for some of the scenes, but when itwas done there were several different thoughts about this film.  I guess what I am trying to say is that it creates conversation.  This isn't a film that you sit down, watch, and walk away without a word muttered through your lips.  This is a piece of art that will remain in your mind long after the film is over, causing questions to arise days, weeks, months after viewing.  I still ask questions about Guido's dream where the women from his past and present all live in the same house as him.  It is so deep and beautiful that it erupts with conversation daily.  I find that a great tool for grading films is how much conversation occurs after them.  Good or bad, if you can talk about it at lengths with friends, than you know you have something special on your hands.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film.  While the ending was a bit confusing, I continued to think about it long after the film was over and came to realize that Fellini is a master of film.  I cannot wait to watch this film again, and again, and again.  It should have won for best film of the year in 1964, or at least for best director, but alas, I can live with the best Foreign Film of the year.  This film should be at or near the top of everyone's favorites list and should be served with an amazing red wine, an open mind, and good friends.  It is the perfect combination for this priceless film.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****it was done there were several different thoughts about this film.

B000007ODM|5.0|I give this album 5 stars for the atmosphere that the music on it creates. I am aware of some drawbacks of the production here, but generally I prefer this CD to Era's next outing \\"Vol.2\\".  <br /> <br />While listening to this album I get the feeling I am walking through a dark and cold and wet dungeon, perhaps of a monastery. I hear the monks chanting somewhere above me, and the weeping guitar simply leads my way through this labyrinthine space. <br /> <br />Love the tracks \\"Era\\", \\"Avemano\\" and \\"Mirror\\", where the beat makes me think of closing of some heavy metal doors, or knocking at the forbidden doors, Enigma once contrived on their first album... And the melancholic ambient intro to \\"Mother\\" with a lovely female voice simply blows me away. There are also other great tunes, some of them aren't to be found on some releases like the ambient \\"After Time\\", which doesn't include any choir, but has a crunchy guitar solos all through it with Florence Dedam's delicate voice (she also performed on \\"Mother\\") between the sharp interludes.  <br /> <br />Oh I forgot about, perhaps, the greatest track here, the oniric \\"Impera\\". The beat, the long guitar solo and the sad chanting of the choir make this album worth the price.  <br /> <br />Simply delirious and enchanting treat for the ears. Highly recommended. Listen attentively, make yourself one with this music...
B000021Y77|5.0|Run Lola Run is a German film made a few years ago that basically took American cinema by storm.  Sure, it's not the most well-known foreign film, but it certainly had a TON of buzz in film and pop-culture circles.  Granted, the film isn't for everyone.  First of all, it IS in German with English subtitles (which seems to turn off some people).  Secondly, the film is very post-modern, incorporating techno music and animation, not to mention a crazy sequence of events.  So, if experimental film is your forte, buy this movie!  <br /> <br />The plot involves a heist-gone-wrong and yes, you certainly see A LOT of Lola running.  And in actuality, the film is like three short films that are very similar but not exactly the same.  The film is an exploration in how changing just one tiny thing in your life can have an effect on the entire grand scheme of things. The Ashton Kutcher film, \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" explored this same motif, but with far less captivating and enjoyable results.   <br /> <br />This film works on many levels.  It's easy to understand but also has a depth to it that will have you talking about it with your friends for a long time.  I watched it in a college film class, but it would also be enjoyable to the general film enthusiast.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain's \\"Greatest Hits\\" cd is the BEST cd out there right now.  You can listen to it without skipping a song!  She's been my favorite singer since 1995 when and ex-boyfriend's mother turned me on to her.  All of her hit songs are on the cd plus four new ones.  Actually three new ones and one sung with two different singers.  I guarantee you will be as pleased with this cd as I was. Five stars! :)
0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi comes alive with fanciful prose.  For five stars, the novel could have built upon Pi's spirituality during the shipwrecked sequence.  I expected the book to head in that direction given the emphasis on Pi's search for religion in the beginning of the novel.  That seemed to be lacking in the whole shipwrecked sequence.  I suppose one can assume that Pi's state of abandonment and desperation while shipwrecked and the various episodes he encounters imply a return to base levels of humanity, i.e. spirituality.  However I felt that was not extensively elucidated by the author as much as would be expected from the beginning of the book.    I felt the prose was highly compelling and the author is a gifted writer.  The ending is certainly a nice surprising twist that I didn't expect.  Overall, quite enjoyable.
B000286RNY|5.0|I rented and watched the original Chinese version. Five minutes before I rented this movie, I heard the video store clerk telling a customer next to us that this was the worst movie he'd ever seen. This is an important fact. Because for anyone without my kind of sense of humor, - which is to say, a love of spoof, parody and utter nonsense - this movie just might be too stupid to enjoy. All of that aside, I cannot remember laughing out loud this hard in the grip of a movie in years! <br /> <br />Folks, this is parody at its best... taking anything even remotely serious about kung-fu movies and turning it into utter comic gold. The best way I can compare this movie would be to call it the \\"Airplane\\" or \\"Top Secret\\" of kung-fu movies. The actors are hilarious. This is more than a slapstick - it's the dialogue that really pushes it over the edge! The cgi animation is so over-the-top, it's impossible to care enough to be put off. Everything is perfectly preposterous, out of line and bizarre. And so, I have to say, it's as if they made this movie just for me.  <br /> <br />I loved it. Every single ridiculous moment.

0553573403|3.0|This first book in a series of fantasy novels along this storyline was a worthy read. It is difficult for me to effectively convey what I actively liked about the book without pointing out where I thought it could be vastly improved. The strengths of this book are in its very compelling, epic-style story, with believable characters who possess human levels of trial and error wisdom.<br /><br />Here's my beef: These are great characters. Why in the world does this author throw forty of them at the reader at once? I know, I know... he has two other books to help flesh out the ones who aren't killed by the end of the first book. This author can't be accused of not having main characters... he does, about seven or eight of them, and I liked his style of giving us a look into them all. My issue was with the continual need for the author to throw in a couple dozen more, all at once, and expect the reader to suddenly understand what the impact of their vague existence is, when they do something plot-connected later on.<br /><br />If you're an ADD-style reader like me, you won't even remember who's who a few chapters later, when the son of the cousin of the deposed king's vassal's daughter says fatal words that effect main characters he's never interacted with. Sound confusing? It certainly can be. It's grueling to sit through histories of fringe characters that we're supposed to be concerned about, but that are easily confused with their relatives, or other fringe characters of a similar name. Some of these characters have nicknames, too... and the author changes which name he's using for the same person in mid-paragraph! Arrrgh!<br /><br />So, this book was an enjoyable 'skimaround'. I read deeply about the characters that were important and interesting, and skipped over the long details about the political scenes between people who made no real difference. At the end of the book, which was obviously set up to get you running off for the next, I was happy to have read the stories of five or six characters, but also not really sure I was looking forward to having to wade through the same confusion to follow those characters into the next couple of books.<br /><br />Good stories, neat perspectives, and an author who isn't afraid to have his characters live, die, and be very human. I liked it! Did it live up to the hype people passed on about it? Not completely... but again, this is from someone with a short attention span. I would certainly recommend it to any fantasy reader, but unless they are the patient type, I would recommend it as a borrowed or library checked-out book, to give it a first taste.<br /><br />On a side note: This book can be rather raw in places, which is certainly in perspective and story appropriate, but some of the language and adult themes make this tale a more mature one.stories of five or six characters, but also not really sure I was looking forward to having to wade through the same confusion to follow those characters into the next couple of books.<br /><br />Good stories, neat perspectives, and an author who isn't afraid to have his characters live, die, and be very human.

B00005JMAH|2.0|I've read many reviews here on Amazon, and I have to say first of all that most of the people I know who loved this version of the adventures of Harry Potter were those who either never read the book, or those who had read it a long time ago.<br /><br />Many who were impressed by Cauron's version of the movie focus more on his putting a darker feel to the movie and quickening the plot.  But do those people not know the essential elements that were left out of the plot and replaced by silly, not-in-the-book elements?<br /><br />Case #1:  The main point of the BOOK was about Sirius's tie to Harry past; how Harry's father, Lupin, Sirius, and Pettigrew were all best friends and became Prongs, Moony, Padfoot, and Wormtail; how they created the Marauder's Map; WHY they chose to become Animagi; that Sirius was the secret keeper until he passed the right to Pettigrew.  The movie almost entirely skips these important plot points!  Many of these things could have been easily explained during the already available dialogue but were left out.  Instead, we are regaled with the addition of a talking head, a way-too-long scene with Hagrid's chomping book, etc.  Could not one of these scenes have been cut short in favor of Dumbledore, Lupin, or Sirius explaining some important points to Harry (and to us?)<br /><br />Case #2:  The character of Dumbledore, especially in the later books, is meant to be a quietly imposing figure with a touch of humor.  Harris played this part to perfection.  He commanded a quiet respect while at the same time applying a subtle touch of humor to his speech.  The new guy, on the other hand (what is UP with that stupid hat?), seems to talk too fast, talks TOO MUCH, and does stupid things that are supposed to be funny but are not (putting his hand on Ron's cast).  In addition, ALL of the books wrap up with an all-important one-on-one between Dumbledore and Harry, in which Dumbledore explains to Harry the things that he had not understood before, like WHY harry's patronus showed up as a stag, and revealing a little more about his past.  That part was entirely skipped.<br /><br />In addition, I understand that maybe some wanted the movie to have a not-so-childish feel, but this is a CHILDREN'S BOOK!  What was up with cloudy, rainy days during the ENTIRE MOVIE?  Is Hogwarts now supposed to be Gotham City or something?  One could understand this ploy in Book 5, perhaps, when the story is dark and gloomy the entire way, but in Book 3?  In the books, the Prisoner of Azkaban may have been slightly darker than the first two, but in no way was there a sense of fear and forboding the entire story.  All of the feel-good scenes were cut out in favor of drawing out scary images and abstract, artistic renderings of important plot developments that non-readers wouldn't fully understand.<br /><br />I especially hated how Cauron implied all of these budding relationships between Hermione and Ron, even Hermione and Harry!  They are 13, yes, but in the books there is not so much of a hint of developing feelings until Book 4.<br /><br />I felt the character developmnt of the characters was also badly done, or done prematurely.  Harry is not supposed to be an angry, bitter teenager until Book 5.  A true reader of the books would have noticed an immediate difference in the way Harry thought and spoke in Book 5 - he became more resentful, distrustful, and angry as a result of the things he now knew.  In Book 3, he barely knows any of his past - what is there to become as angry as he is in this movie?  Draco Malfoy is another example - some of his exaggerated histrionics of fear are laughable when one compares his character to the one in the book.  Yes, Malfoy does seem a simpering wimp at times, but most of it is calculated to get Harry or Ron or Hermione or Hagrid in trouble - the movie shows none of this.<br /><br />I understand that a movie cannot possibly contain every single plot element in the original book, but this one went too farin creating its own little touches and leaving out some signature J.K. Rowling touches in most of her books.  The pace of the movie was rushed - there was never a moment when you saw them just being students at Hogwarts.  Maybe some feel that this slows the plot, as it did in Parts 1 and 2, but I feel this is essential to portraying the true feel when one reads the books.<br /><br />I was supremely disappointed with this latest movie and can only hope for better for Book 4, the Goblet of Fire, which is my favorite in the series so far.s one went too far in creating its own little touches and leaving out some signature J.K.

B000069HK2|5.0|The Used began as a small little band no one knew about, but by some strange coicidence (maybe it was their enormous talent) they broke through, and made it huge.  You'd like to be able to put a lable to them, but you can't, because calling them punk would do injustice to the loud and heavy rock and roll influences, and vice versa.  Bert Mcracken's harsh abrasive voice lies perfectly atop the dangerous lanscape of guitars and screams, like icing on the perfect cake.  You can one minute be swooned in the haunting beauty of tracks like Blue and Yellow, but then agian, you'll dry your tears and get out a sledge hammer when tracks like Box of Sharp objects comes around the corner.  And you ask yourself, are the Used holding you in a tight warm embrace, or are the strangling you?
B000002J0B|5.0|Ok to be honest I only own 3 albums by Led Zeppelin: Zeppelin 4, Houses of the Holy, and a collection of various songs remastered on a 2-disc set. But from what I have heard, this is their best album, better even than 4 with the classic Stairway to Heaven. This is because I consider their best song to be Rain Song, it's just my personal opinion and it has a large influence on why I like this album. My ratings: <br /> <br />1. The Song Remains The Same: 8/10, great opening rock song, so very classic of Led Zeppelin, it reflects much of their earlier songs. <br />2. The Rain Song: 11/10, far surpasses every other Zeppelin song I've ever heard, this is one of the most beautiful and hypnotic songs ever made, and yes it's great to listen to while it's raining ;) <br />3. Over The Hills & Far Away: 10/10, back to back these are the 2 best songs on the album, and another of my favorite Zeppelin songs ever! The opening guitar solo is just fantastic! <br />4. The Crunge: 6.5/10, meh what a bland song, the guitar is a little fun (as always), but otherwise it's not my taste at all. <br />5. Dancing Days: 8.5/10, initially I heard this through STP's cover, and I have to say the original is better, what a great moody song. <br />6. D Yer Mak Er: 7.5/10, not bad, but not great either. I'm not sure why this was the first hit from this album, it's far less inspired than Rain Song or Over the Hills. <br />7. No Quarter: 8.5/10, while much of the song is very quiet and slow, it contrasts nicely with the louder parts, well done. <br />8. The Ocean: 7/10, I think the album should have ended with No Quarter, while this song is good but feels out of place. <br /> <br />I think overall this album may be a 4.5 on my scale, but because it's my favorite of Zeppelin's albums I give it a 5. It may be a tad up and down, but so is my taste for Zeppelin songs in general, and overall this one is their best.
B00000K19E|5.0|A conservative software programmer -Neo- will be designed for the master hacker -Morpheus- curiously the Greek God of dream as the saver of the mankind.<br /><br />The dialogue among them is the key.<br /><br />Morpheus: The Matriz  is everywhere . It is all around us ...It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind from the truth . And the truth is the answer behind Neo' s intriguing question  is : that you are a slave. Like everyone else you were born in bondage , born into a prison that you can not smell or taste or touch . A prison for your mind . Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is . You have to see  it for yourself.<br /><br />And the Agent Smith says to Morpheus: ... Billions of people just living their lives ...oblivious. But I believe the human beings define reality through suffering and the misery. The perfect world was a ream that your primitiove cerebrum keep trying to wake up from. Why is why the Matrix was re-designed to this: the peak of your civilization.<br /><br />Ignorance is bliss says the Cypher accompanied of a smooth melody played by a harp .<br /><br />The film has multiple readings but to my mind you have to go to Dostoievski and the Great Inquirer - the free will- and William Blake can give us important references to understand the real state of the things in which we are immersed. This clever puzzle of images and illusions where you can be living the otherness of yourself and not your real bliss and unless you do not realize,  you can wake up easily of this dream at seventy when nothing can be done . Beware if you are not a centered people , because you can be damned to turn around a fashion style of living .<br /><br />This is a film intellectual stimulating.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|If you don't understand the plot of The Matrix movies, don't blame the movie...   I'm 30 (not 13) and thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy.  I've seen it several times, and everytime I watch it, I understand the plot a little bit better.  It's a very complex plot which can not be fully understood by watching the films only once. <br /> <br />Personally I think the 'let down' experienced by some viewers after seeing Reloaded, is due to the fact that they expected the same mind blowing experience delivered by the first movie.  Unfortunately, we got used to the new type of special effects the Wachowski brothers introduced in the first one, therefor the less than mind blowing effect... <br /> <br />Also, since it was the second of a series of three movies, Reloaded didn't really have a beginning or an end, as in the first and last, which leaves the viewer feeling dissatisfied.   <br /> <br />The Matrix will definetly stay my No 1 for a very long time.  The movie that will displace it will be something very, very special.
B00005JM20|4.0|Secret agent movies are great.  There is no difference when Mr. Bean takes the place of Mr. Bond.  Rowan Atkinson's brand of humor works perfectly in this movie.  Atkinson plays the title character, a bumbling paper-pusher who inadvertently kills all the real MI-7 secret agents.  He's dreamed about being the suave, smooth-talking secret agent, but, in truth, he's the worst agent ever.  Ironically, he is left as England's best agent.  Talk about one heck of a large promotion!  Sounds like that should spell doom for England? <br /> <br />Through his bumbling and misguided style, English (with help from Natalie Imbruglia and Ben Miller) goes toe-to-toe with Pascal Sauvage (played by John Malkovich).  Along the way there are great stunts, hilarious antics, and some funny dialogue.  This movie will keep you laughing from start to finish, a must for anyone who likes parodies (especially of Bond films) or is a Mr. Bean fan.
B00003CXCT|1.0|After watching this travesty of film editing at a friend's house, I am glad I decided not to purchase this DVD set. <br />Thank God I have the Laser Disc transfers to DVD.  It might not be 5.1 sound, but at least it's the original, good versions of these films. <br />If Lucas ever wakes up and decides to release the true original 3 movies in a DVD set, I will be the first in line to buy them.  Until then, \\"Stuff It, George!\\".
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends. Radiohead's most accessible album. Radiohead's most underappreciated album at the time of its release. Dare I say Radiohead's BEST album? <br /> <br />I dare. <br /> <br />Yes, OK Computer purists may find my statement inaccurate, but let me just ask you this, Radiohead fanatics... If you were to loan any Radiohead cd to someone who never heard their music before, which would it be?  <br /> <br />Personally, The Bends was my introduction to the band in 1999... and I'm glad it was. Maybe 4 years too late, but hey - it's never too late right?  <br /> <br />Anyway, this album is classic. Yorke is at his most comprehensible and his lyrics are more human than on future releases. This is the singer/songwriter at his most passionate. Deep, elegant songs like Fake Plastic Trees and High & Dry soar like the best U2 songs (One, With or Without You, etc).  <br /> <br />Jonny Greenwood's uses of spacy guitar and keyboard effects  adds mood to the pieces while the rest of the band gels together so well, you don't even notice it. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a rock album that you can really fall in love with, rock out with, sing a long with... you get the idea.  You can't go wrong with the Bends.
B000007WRN|5.0|This is madonna's best album to date, that's for sure. <br />i will not review this album track by track, but i have to say that listening to this albu is a truly amazing trip to madonna's soul, is a very personal work. <br />my favourite track is drowned world (substitute for love), that was a single outside the states. <br />the plus of this edition is the exellent song has to be. <br />a song that is truly a masterpiece, so beautiful, and so quite, but her voice is in her best!. <br />So, if you don't have this album, now you can get this edition, and i promise you that you won't regret. <br />And if you want more madonna, get also: <br />**MUSIC: really upbeat and is exellent to dancer to. <br />(fav songs: amazing, don't tell me, i deserve it) <br />**AMERICAN LIFE: a great album, no matter what people said about it. with the deep lyrics of ray of light and the exellent music from the music album <br />(fav songs: love profusion, mother & father, hollywood, intervention, xtatic process) <br />**SOMETHING TO REMEMBER: with the WONDERFUL i want you <br />**REMIXED & REVISITED : great remix ep, including the rock mix of love profusion, wich is my favourite remix of the AL era <br /> <br />So, you can't go wrong with her, she is not only an icon, i really don't care about that, i love her music, tht's what really matters at the end <br />BYE!!  <br />
B00068IOWM|4.0|I've read enough reviews and heard enough comments from friends.  The overall mixed consensus either has glowing, effusive reactions to the album or reactionary, disgusted critics.    Things don't change with these guys.    Anyhow, here's some counterpoint:    This guy doesn't like it at all.  [...]    This guy does.  [...]    As for me?    When I first heard Vertigo a couple of months ago, my heart sank.  In the last album they sounded like they had sold out to soft, safe pop, and now it sounds like they'd taken the next step closer with this album.  No new ground has been broken nor do attempts to surge forward in style exist here; we seemingly have a highly polished product of everything they've been doing the past couple of years.    Bono sings well but it doesn't sound like he has the uninhibited passion he unleashed in the first half of their recording career.  The Edge's guitar work is top notch in its precisely executed notes and layering, but it hasn't presented anything completely new.  The rhythm section still lays a solid foundation, and it sounds like Adam Clayton's paid attention much of the garage rock bands that have recently made waves.  The melodies don't really break new ground, and from the start sound a bit half-baked.    So why bother? Upon the first couple of listens, I'd have to agree with the first reviewer I posted.  But each listen acted to peel layers of my indignant criticism and I found myself repeating a couple of tracks (Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights, Original of the Species, Yahweh).    U2 have always been the same; they appropriate the sounds of their musical contemporaries and infuse a nascent, sneaky fish hook of life into them.  I'm sure if I heard my favorite U2 albums come out within the context of their respective time periods, I would have had the same reaction that I just had now.  But upon repeated listens their warmth, their heart, their depth of personality emerges in a way that many of their contemporaries couldonly dream of doing.    I think the genius and appeal of U2 lies therein; they blanket themselves with superficial trends, attitudes and influences of their times but expose their heart through these things as their medium of communication.  So overall, I like this album.  My criticisms of course still stand; they've grown soft, they've gone safe, but they're still U2.  [...] hits my evaluation on the button:    \\"How To isn't U2's strongest album, song for song, but it's the most mature of them all, with enough hard-won wisdom and songcraft to reaffirm the band's role as rock music's version of a peace process.\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|It seems to me like being the 5th album of U2.  <br />When I am listening to these songs (and I do listen to them over and over again), it seems to me that this is the 5th album in their discography. It seems to me like having been recorded before the Joshua Tree, but as if they (Bono and co.) had to go through all the work from Joshua to ATYCLB to write such songs.  <br />I love it. It is not very good, it is great.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|My mother would rent any animated movie the store had in attempt to keep us kids happy.  I saw Warriors of the Wind when I was 10 or so.  I loved that movie.  It was the first real animated movie (i.e. not made for kids) I had ever seen.  Since DVD first became popular, I have been searching for this movie.  By accident I found an \\"Anime Guide\\" in a music/video store and looked it up.  This is where I discovered that the movie was made by Miyazaki (I knew Spirited Away) and that the version I had seen was merely a knock-off of the original.  What was a half-hearted search to find a childhood favorite became an earnest quest to get my hands on the original.  Now, with the release of the full, unadulterated original my anxiety is growing.  I haven't seen the full cut, but I'm sure it will be worthy of my preemptive 5-star rating.
B0006399FS|3.0|I was excited by all the hype surrounding this CD for the past year, expecting to hear what everyone was raving about...\\"raw rock & roll\\" and how the band would be revisiting their roots with this music.  Not so.  After one spin, I learned that it was a far cry from how it was publicized.  Here I was expecting Sunday Bloody Sunday II...but got blindsided by BONO Manilow meets U2 on the block.  Finding tracks that range from complete snoozers, such as \\"Love And Peace Or Else (I'll be fast asleep)\\", to kiddie pop, like Vertigo(go's).    My expecations were just way too high for this mediocre effort.  I read a lot of reviews, and I just can't understand what in the world people are thinking when they use words like \\"Vintage\\" and \\"Classic\\" ???  This isn't a bad CD, but it doesn't come close to such high regard.     In all fairness, U2 is truly a great band made up of some very talented musicians who have cranked out some great music...but not here.  Outside of a few nice (easy listening) melodies, there's really nothing to get excited about.  Worth the 10 bucks, but nothing you CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND!
068987474X|3.0|What is really startling about the phenomenon of this book is that women needed to learn the obvious: the reason that guy isn't calling you or asking you out is because he isn't interested. Period. I have to wonder about women when this is \\"stop the presses\\" news to them. WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU ALL THINKING? If this is a breakthrough to you, you shouldn't be allowed out of your apartments - the world is way too much for you to comprehend.  I have always suspected that the women's magazines and Oprah type shows simply reenforce laughable myths and attitudes in women that have nothing to do with the way the world really works. When someone actually states the obvious in this feminine cultural ghetto/dream world of Cosmo magazines, Oprah chat fests, and hen parties, the effect is something akin to Einstein submitting his general and relative theories to a dumbfounded public.
B00067BBQE|2.0|I was quite eager to pick this little guy up when I first heard it had been released.  I'm a huge fan of the band, as they are one of the first female fronted Goth bands to do well... ever!  <br /> <br />But the editing killed me.  I can't watch it.  Imagine if you will the Blare Witch done at 3000 mph with a fancier zoom lens.  There has got to be about a million cuts per minute and no way to get a sense of what's going on. <br /> <br />I truly love to watch a band play live, but this is too much like trying to see a coked out fly through a dirty water glass. <br /> <br />I would have been okay with maybe the first song or two being like that to induce a felling of excitement.  But when it doesn't end and they're playing a slower song with the camera jumping about like a speed freak toad, I just have to leave the room. <br /> <br />Whoever made this did not have art in mind. <br /> <br />But it does beg the question: if this is what they're churning out, what does that say about our kid's attention spans?
B00067BBQE|2.0|i couldnt wait for this to come out, seemed like they would be great live (whatever live means these days cause there is always a backing track running) i also hope they get some new material out soon. anyway i agree with the editing, it doesnt allow you to focus on anything throughout the concert, just when you can see something every trick in the book is used to \\"edit\\" this show. too bad, quite a let down, maybe some people used to this fast paced style wont mind, but hopefully after they get a few more albums done they can try this again.
B00065U08Q|4.0|If you like experimental music or electronica then chances are you will enjoy this album quite a bit, but if you don't and are just a Frusciante fan or a new fan altogether than try to listen to this before you buy it.<br /><br />1. Sphere - This song isn't bad par se, but the opening part of the song lasts a good four minutes and if you're looking for something that gets it over with quickly, this isn't it.<br /><br />2. The Afterglow - This song has a funky little guitar piece that plays throughout and it's overall feeling is very techno-ish. Unfortunately, it is sometimes hard to decipher what John is singing and it doesn't help that this record comes with no insert containing lyrics.<br /><br />3. Walls - This is one of my favorites on the album. The drum machine sounds really neat as does the distorted riff that plays throughout. The singing is also very cool with John's voice being complimented by Josh's whispered singing style. Very nice.<br /><br />4. Communique - This song is pretty interesting. Between the two tracks that are very piano driven on the album, this is probably the better of the two.<br /><br />5. At Your Enemies - This is another song where Josh does the vocals. The effects are really nicely done and I think a lot of it is done on a synthesizer. Josh's singing here is very hard to understand, but equally beautiful. It's pretty good overall.<br /><br />6. Surrogate People - This song starts out with an interesting synthesizer part that will continue through the song. The acoustic guitar riff that is played is very beautiful and relaxing. This song sounds like it was written for Shadows Collide with People which John said it was in his album bio. The lyrics sung by John are interesting and thoughtful.<br /><br />7. My Life - This song is good, but it shouldn't be on this album. It feels totally out of place with the rest of the electronica style songs on the rest of the album. This is the other piano-driven track on the album.<br /><br />Overall, A Sphere in the Heart of Silence is pretty solid. It's a little shorter than I would've liked, but the material is creative and unique.<br /><br />If you like the style this album is in than it is for you, otherwise it might not be./> <br />Overall, A Sphere in the Heart of Silence is pretty solid.

B00005ATQF|5.0|This is the best example reviewers give of \\"brilliant first part, disappointing second\\". It may be true, the second part of the film is not as entertaining and powerful as the first half but it's no disappointing either. I've watched this a lotta times, so many times I often found myself yelling instead of talking because of Sgt. Hartman's influence. \\"Sir, yes, sir!!!!\\"    The story is known by most of us: part 1-boot camp, part 2-Vietnam war.    After several viewing you get to like the characters instead of seeing them as just killer machines, which is what they were trained for. \\"What makes the grass grow?!!! -Blood, blood, blood!\\" \\"What are we here for?!!! -Kill, kill, kill!\\"    Senior drill instructor, gunnery sergeant Hartman played by Lee Ermey is one of the best and funniest characters ever put on screen. Sure you can feel sorry by the dehumanizing way he treats the privates but it is so funny how he manages to do it with a profanity-creative dialogue that I just had to memorize.    Overall, watch this film...watch the whole thing, it's worth it.    \\"You are pukes, you are the lowest form of life on earth, you are not even human f***ing beings! You are nothing but unorganized grab-asstic pieces of amphibian s***!\\"    -Gunnery sergeant Hartman.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I will admit, this is definitely a darker story, it's a great script, well done acting from the children (got to give credit to Rupert Grint as Ron), and slick special effects, the effects are less exposing then the first movie. Even though some scenes are little too short or too long to understand, this is a wonderful movie, and worth watching.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This movie is disgusting, vile and even worse factually inaccurate.  It is sick that anyone made money on this film and someone spent money on this film!  The JEWS had nothing to do with the death of JC, it was clearly the Romans.  The Passion Plays this movie is based on, caused the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent JEWS by inciting hatred over the last 2,000 years.  Can we please get out of the Dark ages?  Just if you were wondering, I am not Jewish.
078322608X|1.0|Sorry guys, but this movie(?) was an absolute bore.  Both Willis and Stowe have made some good movies, both before and after this piece of crap, but c'mon!!! I've seen better acting during high school plays.  This ludicrous film should be avoided at all costs unless you're suffering from insonmia and need something to put you out for the night.  12 Monkeys.  One can't help but wonder if that's the name of the movie, or if that's who wrote the script.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is indeed an amazing album. It lies between real metal and old school progressive, with a fantastic singer. And to yoohooscoobydoo, the day Good Charlotte learn more than a bar chord you can call them musicians. They should spend more time on the guitars and less time with Revlon and Covergirl.
B0006399FS|5.0|Man, what do you people want? I think you expect too much from a rock band!  This is a great, mature, confidant album from a great band. Get it! I listened to the whole thing from start to finish and loved it.  Great guitar work, thoughtful lyrics, great songs!  Lighten up and enjoy.  Allow an artist to take your mind where he wants you to go!

B000687M48|2.0|Evanescense is a very entertaining band live but this CD does not justify Evanescence live. Anywhere But Home has to be the worse live mainstream release I have ever heard. If anybody is a concert bootleg shopper, you could find better live shows. For this CD, there is way to much emphasis on the audience so you could barely hear Amy singing. The DVD isn't bad, its just not properly mixed. Watch evanescence at a real concert and you'll understand.
B00005JNDX|5.0|I'm a big fan of Bridget Jones and as a great admirer of this warm, human and funny heroine I find this movie even funnier than the first one.  <br />My favorite male carachter is Mark Darcy and for all of us who <br />do prefer him to  Daniel Cleaver he is in much more scenes, which makes the movie even more interesting.  <br />There is jut one objection to it. I wish that the script writers have kept the Rebecca story as it is in the book instead of how is in the movie. <br />To see Colin Firth playing Mark Darcy is nothing but a perfect chance to admire once more this fantastic actor. Excellent job Mr. Firth, you are very funny in this movie. <br />Rene is brilliant. <br /> <br />Mara Zuriaga Fernndez. <br />
B0000AQS6R|5.0|The last true family man. That is how Clark Griswald is described by his fellow co-worker reguarding using his Christmas bonus to put in an in-ground pool for his family. Needing to place a $7500 deposit to ensure the pool gets put in at the right time the ground is thawing, Clark overextends himself, not having the money in his bank accout to cover the check he wrote, he needs this bonus more than ever. each day the bonus doesn't show up in the mail, Clark's good ol' family fun filled Christmas cheer is being drained.. quickly.. with the help of his family. As having your own parents stay with you during the holidays isn't hard enough, he's forced to share his holiday with his wine guzzling, chain smoking mother in law, uptight father in law, Aunt Bethany who wraps things from around her house to give as presents, not excluding living things, Uncle Lewis whom I thought for the longest time was Maury Povitch. But nothing compares to what rolls in, complete with home to invade and shamelessly impose on this Christmas, Cousin Eddie (played by the hilarious Randy Quaid) and his family. Between squirrels stowing away in the Christmas tree, Juliette Lewis' (Audrey) eye balls being frozen, and Chevy Chase punching a plastic Santa in it's face, it's the little things in this movie that make it an all time classic. I would even watch this if it weren't Christmas time. This is the last of the great 80's comedies.
0142000663|4.0|John Steinbeck's novel, The Grapes of Wrath is a story about a poor Oklahoma family of farmers that are forced out of their land and have no choice but to migrate to the promise land of California during the Great Depression. They face many hardships along the way and find the truth about California.<br />  The book might have been more interesting and enjoyable if it wasn't required. Although the book went off topic in a couple of chapters, the story got interesting towards the end. I admit it was a little dull at the start but then it captivated me by the middle of the story. The book teaches us that many issues from long ago still trouble us today and that everything that shines isn't gold. Steinbeck does an exceptional on describing the situations that many \\"oakies\\" or migrants from Oklahoma face on their fight for survival in the hostile land of California.<br />  The Grapes of Wrath may not be the best book ever but its not the worse. It might be a little rough around the edges but it can be very enjoyable to read and informative about the issues of migrants that are still around today. In conclusion I give this book a 4 out of 5.
1400034779|4.0|This review is more for the whole series than for the first book itself.<br /><br />If you're looking for something light, entertaining, and well-written, this is the series for you.  The books are short, and the stories and characters are easy to follow and remember.<br /><br />Flaws I find in the series include a tad too much melodrama and one-sided villians.<br /><br />Check these out from the library and read 'em all in one day.  You'll be sad to leave Africa.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Before going into the theatre, I was very skeptical of this movie... little did I know that I was about to watch what would become one of my favorite comedies of all time. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is one of those films that is so random and unpredictable that it is funny. At the same time, it has some of the \\"it's funny because its true\\" kind of humor. <br /> <br />It definitely surpasses all of the trash that Hollywood is obsessed with putting forth. In fact, this movie may very well have restored my faith in the movie industry. I liked the fact that Napoleon Dynamite wasn't loaded up with porn or excessive swearing in a vain attempt to make it shocking or appealing. It also gains points due to the fact that it is different from the rest. <br /> <br />It is really quite sad that more theatres didn't play this movie.
0140277447|4.0|Nov 29, 2004  Tokyo minister praises textbooks playing down war atrocities    Tokyo - JAPAN'S Education Minister has praised recent history textbooks that reduce references to the country's World War II atrocities, including the military's use of sex slaves, news reports said yesterday.    Mr Nariaki Nakayama said every country should reflect on its past wrongdoings, but suggested Japan's education system must rid itself of 'self-condemning' perceptions that everything the country did was bad, according to major national newspapers.    Recent school texts that mention Japan's past transgressions only fleetingly were better than the old versions, Mr Nakayama was quoted as saying in a speech in southern Oita prefecture on Saturday.    'There was a time when they were filled with extremely self-deprecating material, as though Japan had done nothing but bad things,' he said.    'I am glad to see that, at last, the use of terms like 'comfort women' and 'forced labour' has decreased recently. It is very important to teach the future children of Japan in a way that they can live with pride in their race and their history,' he added.    'Comfort women' was the euphemism used to describe sex slaves for Japanese troops.    Japan's history textbooks are a sensitive issue for Asian countries that suffered from Tokyo's aggression.    The approval of a middle-school textbook in 2001 written by a group of nationalist scholars damaged the country's relations with South Korea and China, which said it whitewashed Japan's wartime past.    Japan's military seized up to 800,000 people from China, Korea and other Asian countries in the early 1900s and sent them to do work in Japan, often under brutal conditions.    The number of women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Taiwan and the Netherlands who were forced into sex slavery was estimated to be about 200,000. -- ASSOCIATED PRESS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE
B0000019PA|5.0|This album proves that sometimes less is more. This band manages to create beautiful soundscapes out of one singer and an acoustic guitar on some tracks(Two Headed Boy, Oh Comely).  This album evokes beautiful, if strange images in ones head.  I am a gigantic fan of Complicated, amazing, songs by artists such as The Mars Volta, and I enjoy this album very much.  Reccomended for any fan of music
B0002SROT0|4.0|It's a small consolation that Elliot Smith's posthumous release is not by any means the kind of opportunistic barrel scraping that you see with Tupac Shakur's material. From a Basement on the Hill is the album that Smith was working on at the time of his death last October; rather than take advantage of tragedy, Smith's friends and family helped piece together one last glimpse into the mind of indie rock's tortured junkie prince. <br /> <br />Though it's his last release, this is not Smith's strongest album. That's not to say that it's bad, but for a man that supposedly stabbed himself in the heart two times, you would expect something as biting, pained and upsetting as his 1995 self-titled release. The production is phenomenal - the soaring opener \\"Coast to Coast\\" features jangly electric guitars, tinny piano and a booming rhythm section, for example - and \\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\" is overwhelmingly gorgeous. Smith's epic, Beatles-esque songwriting perkily overpowers the influence of what could be called unsubtle hints on tracks like \\"Fond Farewell\\" and \\"King's Crossing.\\" Though you won't find anything nearly as gritty or despairing as \\"Christian Brothers,\\" there is still the sense of malaise that keeps constant with the rest of Smith's work. <br /> <br />The most definite claim I can make about this disc is that there's no sense of finality (which you'd expect from a an album written before a suicide - Joy Division's Closer comes to mind). It's just another step in Smith's tragically precluded artistic progression, but it without a doubt reveals how much poorer the independent music scene will be without him. <br />
0156027321|3.0|This is one of those books that had everyone talking for a couple of months.  After I read it, I saw it everywhere...xmas presents, birthday presents, book clubs.  I couldn't believe that people liked it that much.  They must not read very much.<br /><br />The sad truth is that \\"good books\\" will be labeled as such and gain substantial popularity because they have good press.<br /><br />I think that it is an interesting book.  It's different.  It does make you think.  But the end is somewhat confusing and rather pointless.  It's fairly disappointing given how much the reader must wade through to get to the finish.  But I think that most people will enjoy reading this novel.  Don't go into it with huge expectations, and you'll wind up fairly happy.
0812550706|5.0|I finished this book in two days.  I could hardly put it down.  If you purchase it please only start reading on a Friday evening.
B0006399FS|5.0|After listening to this album for a week I believe that it is U2's third best, behind Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The only way that they could have improved it would be by adding Mercy and replacing Vertigo with Native Son. Then it would be a classic. <br /> <br />BTW, I'm not sure why people are complaining about no lyrics booklet, i'm holding mine right now.
B000000WCA|5.0|This album brings me back then when my sister who is now 14 going on 15 was in kindergarden and back then when Rossler, mike, joey, mike and joey, Bruce, Yugo, Junior, Petey Pablo McNabb, Jason, were listening to spice girls and we even used to buy the lolipops. those were the days. My favorite spice girl was baby spice because she is cute as hell. the thing about back then was when i said, damn posh is hott, people were making fun of me and saying, hahaha you like girls. and i said no i do i hate them. but back then i wasnt like rossler or mike, [...]. thats right they dropped at age 9. thats how i had the early jump off and all of you were making fun of me for something that you were gonna like in the future. i was like man i like posh damn she is soo sexy. and then rossler admitted he liked posh. but to the public he hated girls and he said he would beat up a girl in real life. and mike said he liked baby spice and we used to make fun of him. and he would be like noooo i dont. shut up. and then \\"Bogus\\" mikes brother would be like, \\"WTF are you listening to\\" he was like man yall some punk A$$ bustas. and he told me he was down with queensbridge and down with the hood and he said he used to hustle in the streets and he wanted to be in the rap game. but unfotunately Eminem beat him in a Freestyle battle. but now all of them backstabbed me. then all are Non virgins and im the only one whos a virgin. look what happened to the world. then they wonder why i went berserk and outta control. Ive learned a valuable lesson in life. \\"take control of them while they are young, when they are older, they will not obey you  anymore.\\" because i tried to help rossler. i tried to guide him and show him the truth and the leadership of me. but then i failed. someone took over and \\"Commander & Cheif\\" that man was Jason X. he then dethrone me and took over and changed rossler in his own image. and its all my fault. come to think of it, damn, what would have ever happend if i never evermerged with ETW and HCW? wouldnt i be a non virgin by then? wouldnt rossler be down with my crew? matter of fact. wouldnt feliks still be best friends with jason??? damn all because of that rossler, feliks, jason. all changed chose there own path. followed there way into the tunnel. wow all because of that one time in March of 2002. damn if i never tried to merge with etw rossler could have been a football fan like me. he could have been a hip hop head like me. rossler could have stayed a video game fanatic like me. but all because of that disatrose incident. and whats bad about that is i cant even try changing rossler or convincing him to get his head straight because he refuse to listen to me or see me as a leader. i was dethrone and the only person who has his future in hand is jason and his band. basically rosslers life is in jasons hands. he must decide what rossler will do. hey i guess its right what they say. you hang out with nerds you become a nerds, you hang out with crackheads you become a crackhead, you hang out with pot heads you become a pothead, you hang out with drunk F*cks you become a drunk F*ck. you hang out with smokers, you become a smoker and thats what happen to rossler. never could resist the temptations. its a sad sad world we live in..........
B00005N83M|4.0|Jennifer Lopez's second album, J Lo, was one that I played a lot during 2001.  I love the opening 3, Love Don't Cost A Thing, I'm Real and Play as well as Walking On Sunshine.  The Cory Rooney and Trackmasters and Ric Wake songs are also heavy on the dance sounds.  I like the sexy Dance With Me and the way Puffy and Mario Winans can do the beats and music on it with its shuffling feel. Ain't It Funny and its Latin rhythms I love. I like that one ballad in the middle, Come Over.  But this is such a consistent and fun album for the hour it lasts.
B0006399FS|5.0|The lads have done it again.  The new work has sounds of the old days of \\"Boy\\" and \\"October\\" with a taste of the newer techno sound.  Very well written....
B00006CXXU|5.0|Although there has been talk of Christina Aguilera growing up \\"to fast\\", how old is she again? oh yea 24, id say that thats plenty old enough to make decisions by herself. And thank God because if she hadent made the decision to take control of her second cd then some of the most insporational music to date may have not been written and performed. Songs like \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Fighter\\" are songs that inspire you to live life to the fullest. This cd is well worth the money and will not disapoint.
B00006879E|5.0|Well, I've had this CD for quite a while now, and still am amazed with it everytime I listen to it. I decided to check out what other people thought of this CD, and I must say that I was really suprised at some of the comments made; some were helpful, but a lot were trash -- opinionated trash as always. This is also of course my opinion, and you can call it trash if you'd like, but I've got to say that no mainstream band has as much musical talent as these guys do. Their music is really ingenious. The lyrics, if listened to carefully, are actually very relatable. Unlike most, Maroon 5 has found a happy medium between pop and rock, to create melodic songs that aren't just bubble-gum crap. The album goes through different musical styles; so, not each and every song is different, but couples of songs produce varied, pleasant sounds. Adam Levine's voice is great, and the band really knows their music. I think most people into pop/rock/r&b will like this album, but to truly appreciate it to its absolute, you have to like listening to music in the dark once in a while.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Yep... why is this animated classic constantly bashed? One reason is how it \\"doesn't follow the book.\\" As much as I hate hearing about that gripe from book fanatics, I can't say much because I myself haven't read the book. But judging from some slight criticisms, the movie may have missed more important stuff. But do kids care? Most likely not. They're just interested in this odd world that Alice stumbled upon, all the colors, and all the strange creatures.    Another reason is perhaps the most asinine statement I've heard: the movie contains \\"drug references\\" or \\"it's about a drug trip.\\" Oh God, how low can some people go? Just because there's a catepillar smoking doesn't mean he's \\"toking it.\\" Just because Alice takes a few bites of some mushrooms doesn't mean she's \\"hallucinating.\\" Just because there's a bunch of weird things going on in this movie doesn't make it a \\"stoner movie.\\" First of all, what made you come to this conclusion? Someone said it? You yourself watched this movie \\"under the influence\\"? If you want a stoner movie, go watch \\"Cheech and Chong's Up in Smoke\\" or \\"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle.\\"    Anywho... \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was my sister's favorite when she was a wee lass. She learned every word and scene. I picked up on it when I was small as well, but it wasn't my favorite. Watching this now as a 19 year old bum, I see it as art. This movie is something more creative than anything Disney has ever done. Alice goes on a strange journey through a place full of wonder. And the \\"it was all a dream\\" theme might be played out, but it's still an amazing story to witness. Probably my favorite out of the movie is the Walrus and Oysters story. Funny and great storytelling.    The DVD is enough to keep the hardcore DVD enthusiast happy.  A couple of featurettes and a documentary as well as a Mickey Mouse short that was based on Alice's journey (yep, the mouse himself embarks on a strange journey as well). And the picture... crystal clear. It's always great to see an animated film on DVD. Everything becomes clearer and sharper, you can see every little drawn and colored detail. And the sound... hey, it's 5.1 surround sound. What more do ya want?    \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a great movie for the kiddies to watch. Being a former youngster whilst watching this movie, I was in awe and dazzled by what the movie offered. It's one of my favorite Disney movies as well, ranking up with \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" \\"Lilo & Stitch,\\" and others. This movie is a classic in my eyes.    Note: For all you people that still think this is a stoner movie, try this lil' trick out. Remember that lil' \\"Wizard of Oz/Dark Side of the Moon\\" trick? Well, if you have this movie as well as Pink Floyd's grandioso rock opera masterpiece \\"The Wall\\"... yep, listen to Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" while watching \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" Here's a lil' instructional guide. Stick in the first disc of \\"The Wall\\" and put on pause while you load up \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" Right when the movie starts playing, unpause \\"The Wall.\\" The only catch is that \\"Comfortably Numb\\" MUST be skipped... and of course, pause the movie when you change discs. Once done, resume. Yep... then just sit back and enjoy \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" like never before.    Here's some \\"things\\" to see if your in-sync (don't read if ya wanna be surprised):    - When Alice picks up her cat, a baby sound should be heard and \\"The Thin Ice\\" should sync up pretty good when Alice sings.    -\\"Another Brick in the Wall, pt. 1\\" should start up as soon as Alice falls down that hole and descends into \\"Wonderland.\\"
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Nobody seems to get it.  This CD has nothing to do with the fact that we all have most of these songs already.  What it is, is that here is a great mix of hits all on one CD that allows you to get one nice fix of newly rearranged Neil between the CDs of other artists on your car's CD player during a drive somewhere.  Take it from me having finally played out both the Decade and Live Rust compilations on my car CD player.  This new CD comes just in time!
B00005JLEX|5.0|The most unique show on television..I had forgotten how much I love this  show..I never missed it..and I ALMOST MISSED THIS..I almost changed my mind and did not order the dvds..I got season 1-3...one of the rare shows that I hate to end! So, of course, I just go to the next episode! This is great..thank you Jerry, Larry & gang for getting together to make this possible!
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 used to be the boss band on earth, U2 was the band  that marked the musical tendencies to follow by other  bands, as far as music, as live performances, as how to  look, etc.But after Pop the band finally sold to the  easy teens market forever.   ATYCLB was an enormous success of sales, but such a terrible album, without sense as a real worth and new disc.U2 in the 80s was the most respected band of the planet, and their music was  absolutely away of hard rock and glam rock of those  years. They became the best band, while all the other groups wasted time saying that they will be the best ones using stupid and infantile melodies. In the 90s U2 was the band that  could break whenever they wanted the musical tendencies, and  the 3 discs published in that decade were amazing,  different and irresistible. Now in 2000 U2 is no more  than the memory of that excellent band, they are the  most boring old men of the rock treating again to copy  such magic timeless music like Joshua Tree or Acthung  Baby, but they have failed irremediably in their attempt, being now only one stupid parodia from which they got to be.   They have spent 7 years from the last time they made music and  the world respected them. Now the musical sense of  expectancy is only so that it is \\"the new U2  album\\", but not so that it is the best album, only  by the registered tradename \\"U2\\".  Bono sings like an older and older man, with a hoarse and rough  voice, and gets to be ridiculous the attempt to reach  at the higher notes that he reached in Unforgettable Fire or Joshua Tree. The most creative member of the group, The Edge, has died like musician, and he always uses the same guitars , without no innovation nor creativity. The production is horrible,  absolutely commercial songs without any sense, the  cover of the album is the worst of the U2 history .  They spent more than 2 years in making this product for  teens, loaded of musical cliches, and they only leave a deep dislike for those we were surprised with Zooropa, Pop,  Unforgettable Fire. This album is nothing new, is the  same ATYCLB way.   For sure U2 will sell millions of copies with this, but  after 20 years the people still will be listening and  loving Pride ( in the name of love ), Stay, One, Bad,  Sunday Bloody Sunday, All I Want Is You, Angel Of  Harlem, Staring At The Sun, Please, The First Time, The  Fly, Running To Stand Still, With Or Without you, etc,  but they will forget all their commercial hypes since  2000.    Dream Is Over ( John Lennon, 1970 ).
B000089RVX|5.0|Yeah, call me a dumbass for giving this album five stars. Go ahead and hit the \\"No, this review was not helpful\\" button like the coward you are, safely behind your computer screen, anonymously. Go ahead and preach about how \\"Evanescence is not metal, go listen to Slayer,\\" blah blah blah crap. Who the hell gave you such authority to say what's heavy metal and what's not? Fact: Joy Division and Nico are goth rock. And so are Evanescence. Can't accept the truth? Fine. Go round up your lil' weird head banging friends or siblings or parents and start b!tching to me. Just because you don't think so doesn't mean it's true. Your opinion doesn't matter. Mine doesn't either, but I'm not changing my mind. You can't force me, kids. Now why don't you go listen to Slipknot or Cradle of Filth while I type up a review that your little one-sided minds can't comprehend, mmkay? Other than that, shut the hell up. <br /> <br />Now... as for my reason of a five star rating? The holiest score of the holiest? Even holier than Jesus? A five star rating can mean two things to me.  <br /> <br />One: the album marks some sort of musical impact and will be remembered for generations to come. An album full of artistic integrity. An album that spoke to a generation of folk. An album of social impact and high importance.  <br /> <br />And two: I like all songs.  <br /> <br />So how did Evanescence gain such a high rating from me? From explanation number one or two? I'd say the first one, but that'd be pushing it. Actually, Evanescence received five stars from me because I like all songs. Liking all songs = a five star album to these ears. <br /> <br />What more to add to what is already said? Amy Lee has such an incredible and beautiful voice that'll make Christina Aguilera panic. Her lyrics are truly inspirational and powerful. Every song, and I do mean every song, display such musical emotion. The goth rock sound (yep... I said \\"goth,\\" whatchoo gonna do about it?) truly brings out the emotion ofAmy's singing and lyrics. Give \\"Tourniquet\\" a few spins to see what I mean. Want melodic and beautiful sounding music? Give \\"My Immortal\\" a listen or two. Just listen to the blissful and soft piano play. Wanna hear the most overplayed song since \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\"? Give \\"Bring Me to Life\\" a few spins to piss off your friends, neighbors, and relatives for fun. <br /> <br />Although it's a damn good album, the strings kinda make it \\"overproduced.\\" Oh well... the Beatles have overproduced albums as well but no one seems to care. And the strings here still sound good, making the tracks all the more powerful and anthemic sounding. <br /> <br />Hey, don't be so mad because I'm giving this album five stars and calling this band goth. Chances are, you probably like something like Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, Slipknot, and Dimmu Borgir, giving those bands a five star rating. Hey, some of their stuff are good... they're just not five star worthy. Fact is, I enjoyed this album as much as I enjoy other albums from other great bands. The songs here I enjoy whole-heartly. I liked every song here... this album gets five stars from me, and I'm sticking by it. You don't like it? Fine. Don't b!tch to me about it, though. You'll just waste your time.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Where to begin? First off, let me just say that this is by far my favorite movie ever. Regardless of what you think of my review you need to go out and pick this up.  <br /> <br />There was a time when I judged a movie's merit by how high the level of information overload was. The more special effects, THX 3D blanket of sound, and larger-than-life characters there were, the better. Then I saw Leon and my perspective shifted considerably. I first saw this movie in my college dorm room on HBO. I only saw the first 30 minutes before I had to leave for a class, but I was intrigued. It would be another two years before I would decide to rent it and see what it was all about. When I walked into the video store I spotted a VHS titled \\"The Professional\\" and rented it. I later realized that this was the edited \\"American\\" version. A full 30 minutes had been cut! I was a bit pis/ /sed(apparently this word is censored...lol) off that some censors didn't think I would be able to handle whatever it was that was cut, so I went back the next week and got the Leon DVD, the uncut version. After viewing The Professional I decided it was about 9 out of 10 stars. After seeing Leon, I would have to give the Professional 7 stars and Leon 10. It's that big of a difference. Let me start by breaking the movie down into each part. You can read other reviews if you want a plot review, but I'll try to get a bit deeper with my review.  <br /> <br />Acting  <br />This is where the movie really shines. There isn't a single noticeable CGI effect, the \\"explosive action\\" is quite limited, and the sets and locations are pretty sparse. And what that does is let the acting take over. Every single part here is played beautifully. Gary Oldman might be a bit over the top in his role, but despite that it is fun to watch. Jean Reno plays Leon, the quiet introverted hitman, and is able to communicate so much with so little. He gives the impression of a cold and neutral killer and then switches to being a naive yet caring person.  <br /> <br />But the real star here is Natalie Portman. This was her debut, and what a debut it is. Her interpretation of the semi-goth, edgy, seductive Mathilda is easily the best performance she's ever given. When watching the movie you never think, \\"Wow this actress sure is good.\\" Instead you're caught up in the story and you see Mathilda as a real person, not just a great performance by an actor. Portman is able to alter the entire mood of a scene with something as slight as subtly arching her eyebrows. The way she delivers her lines is amazing as well. Her very first word is spoken to Leon as a simple \\"Hi\\". But she even says it differently than one would expect. In a later scene she tells a group of neighborhood boys her own age to leave her alone with the line \\"So go play someplace else, ok?\\". It perfectly conveys what's going on inside her. Everything about her performance is subtle yet powerful.  <br /> <br />Cinematography  <br />The look of this film is beautiful. There's a muted, low saturation, high contrast feel that really draws you into the world on screen. Interesting camera angles are everywhere but never overpower the elements they're filming. For a movie that takes place in such an average setting, the camera work really makes it feel like a surreal place all its own. This is the movie that was the transition for Besson from \\"French\\" films like la Femme Nikita to mainstream American fare like The 5th Element (shudder...). What we get is a solid American base with the aesthetic tone of French film. It's a great combo.  <br /> <br />Music Score  <br />As if the movie itself wasn't good enough, we also get an amazing score. Eric Serra perfectly takes what's happening on screen and translates it into audio form. With alot of movies like this you might expect just some \\"creepy synth tones\\" and drum loops, but you get alot more here. There are simple piano melodies, rich acoustic guitar, subsonic bass swells, and brittle organic drumming. Part of the score was used later as a full song on the soundtrack titled \\"Angel\\". With NINish drums and a hollow flute like melody this song encapsulates the feel of this movie better than anything else. It's hard to describe exactly how it does, but listen and you might get it. The final scene of the movie is an overhead shot of Mathilda that rises up to the New York skyline. This is accompanied by the song \\"Shape of My Heart\\" by Sting. They couldn't have picked a better song to close things. Somebody should seriously get an award for suggesting to use that song. It's synesthetic bliss between film and music.  <br /> <br />The \\"Lolita\\" Issue  <br />It's hard to find a review that doesn't touch on this topic. In the edited \\"The Professional\\" about 30 minutes of Leon/Mathilda interaction is taken out in an attempt to appease uneasy American audiences with more of an \\"action\\" movie. Those 30 extra minutes make Leon quite a different movie.  <br /> <br />It doesn't take long for Mathilda to fall for Leon. All her life she's been neglected and she finally meets someone who seems to care for her. Her actual feelings might be the want of a father-figure, but her outward expression of those feelings is much more seductive. Leon is in a similar situation. He's a loner and when this young girl starts advancing on him he gets nervous. Despite his effort to turn her advances away he still can't deny 'some' feeling for her. All this makes for some interesting dynamics between the two.  <br /> <br />Some people might read this and get turned off by the thought of a relationship between the middle-aged Leon and the thirteen year old Mathilda, but you really need to see the movie before you make that judgement. After a while you'll start to see the temptation that Leon is going through. I can't imagine there being a single guy who could watch this movie and not feel 'some' level of attraction to Mathilda. But that's the point. Her character is supposed to be sexually seductive. But she's not sexy in a gratuitous cheesy porn-mag way. There's more of a deep innocent undercurrent to her. You can't help but want to help her, to comfort her. I once read a review that said there's clearly an unspoken understanding that Luc Besson, Jean Reno, and every guy in the audience would take advantage of Mathilda's advances if they knew they could get away with it. I'm not sure if it's that extreme, but there is that element to it. Portman was later even offered the title role in a remake of the film \\"Lolita\\", which she turned down. There's no doubt that she was considered based on her work in Leon. In short, if things like this bother you, don't watch the movie...  <br /> <br />Well, that's about all there is to say. This movie works on so many levels. It's downright annoying that it's marketed as an action movie in America when clearly that's only about 5% of the movie. This is a dark, dissonant, subtle movie and it deserves more than the \\"action\\" title it is labeled. Rumor has it that Luc Besson has written a script for Leon 2. Natalie Portman has even commented that she's read the script and is quite interested. And to top it off, she recently cut her hair \\"Mathilda style\\". Nothings confirmed, but I sure hope a sequel is made. I can't imaging it topping the first movie and given some of Besson's latest work (The 5th Element...) I'm a but worried it might flat out suck. But Leon is enough for me. Rent this movie. I dare you.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Throughout the late 80's and early 90's, Guns N' Roses held themselves and solidified their position as a strong and destructive band, and this Greatest Hits compilation proves just that. With memorable faves such as \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", and \\"Paradise City\\", and other essentials like \\"Yesterdays\\", \\"Civil War\\", and a cover of the classic Wings hit, \\"Live And Let Die\\", this collection allows GNR fans to say that this was a very great band. Axl's penetrating wails and Slash's all-star guitar licks are definitely wild, crazy, and, above all, incredible. <br /> <br />Guns N' Roses, however, could not hold its own as the years went by, and Axl ended up with the bill after the rest of the band walked out. But we will always have the memories of Guns N' Roses thanks to this collection of hits. I recommend this for any die-hard GNR fan or any hard rockers out there. Get it!
B00008BRDX|5.0|i'll admit i'm listening to them on 25-year-old vinyl, but having just spent the evening listening to both 'synchronicity' and 'regatta de blanc', i agree with the other reviewers that 'regatta de blanc' is a very fine album. it's not as polished as 'synchronicity', sure, but if it's polished you want i have several britney spears bootlegs i can let go for cheap. there's more energy and cagey nihilism in 'regatta'. it puts me in mind of adam and the ants or early sparks. it makes me wanna dance in my living room, and that's really the highest praise i can give any album.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|To be entirely honest, I listened to this CD with quite high expectations, having heard so many rave reviews about it from all my friends. And admittedly, the vocals are fantastic and the plot is somewhat more original than the usual Broadway fluff. But other than a few standout songs (three or four at the most), I found this pretty standard, run-of-the-mill stuff. The music is far too poppy and synthesizer-driven (it reminds me of the eighties), the lyrics are often awkwardly phrased (verdigris?), and most of the characters I found so fascinating in the book (Fiyero and Elphaba, namely) were completely stripped of any and all color in the musical. There's no new ground covered here, no fresh ideas or characters; just a few good singers, some mediocre songs, and a watered-down plot. Major disappointment. I suggest Avenue Q for some real entertainment.
1594200106|5.0|The first sentence hooked me: \\"I still remember the day my father took me to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books for the first time.\\"<br /><br />And more:<br /><br />\\"This is a place of mystery, Daniel, a sanctuary. Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens . . . When a library disappears, or a book-shop closes down, when a book is consigned to oblivion, those of us who know this place, its guardians, make sure that it gets here. In this place, books no longer remembered by anyone, books that are lost in time, live forever, waiting for the day when they will reach a new reader's hands. In the shop we buy and sell them, but in truth books have no owner. Every book you see here has been somebody's best friend. Now they have only us . . .\\"<br /><br />We are in Barcelona, 1945, and 10-year-old Daniel Sampere has just chosen a book to protect, one that will have special meaning for him. It is The Shadow of the Wind, by Juli&aacute;n Carax, and once Daniel reads it, he will begin a search for Carax's other work. But he will discover that someone else is also engaged in that search, and is systematically destroying every copy of Carax's books that can be found.<br /><br />As the years pass, Daniel's life begins to parallel Carax's and intertwine with it, as he unravels a mystery that reaches back to the days before and during the Spanish Civil War, and finds love, friendship and betrayal.<br /><br />A tightly-woven and intricate plot, realistic and psychologically complex characters, beautiful language, romance, passion, and mystery all add up to a book that is difficult to put down.<br /><br />Here's hoping that more of Zaf&oacute;n's work gets translated into English.
6305922756|5.0|Though a bit scattershot and predictable at times, \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" is the definite satire on the big hair, late-70s rock scene. The first time I saw this film, it took me awhile to realize it was a put-on. The performances are so dead-pan, dead-on and sincere, and the ensemble work is so perfect that you forget you are watching a hilarious send-up of a music genre that is already a self-caricature.<br /><br />The film follows the come-back tour of a band that never was much of anything to begin with. The band members are semi-talented, self-absorbed and self-important. They are oblivious to the fact that a string of cancellations and no-shows at album signings means they are not popular. The band soldiers on, from one tiny venue to another (at one point they are actually second billing to a puppet show), proving that if you can't be better, you can be louder. The film satirizes everything rock: the faux-satanic outer space stage gear; the trouser-bulging, blow-dried and hairy-chested look of the period; pretentious evocations of all things druid; unreflectively and unabashedly sexist album covers and song titles (\\"Sex Farm Woman\\" and \\"Lick My Love Pump\\" being my favorites). You have your thinning-haired, bevested managers, empty-headed full-chested groupies, manager-wannabe girlfriends, exploding drummers, and much more.<br /><br />Special kudos to Michael McKean and Christopher Guest for playing the band's \\"founders,\\" Nigel Tufnel and David St. Hubbins. They are entirely convincing as old school chums who have been rocking for years. Just managing to keep a straight face through this insanity is worthy of an Oscar. A notable mention to Harry Shears, whose leather-and-steel-clad bass player is a preview of a similar turn in \\"A Mighty Wind\\". Recreations of the band's past as a 60s \\"Flower Power\\" band are just perfect. The only thing missing (thankfully) is alcohol and drug abuse, which would have ruined the band's (and the film's) loopy innocence.
B00008BRB5|4.0|i'm annoyed that they tacked on 'murder by numbers' to the end of this re-issue, since it wasn't on the original LP. a previous reviewer says it ruins the mood of empty existentialism of the album after 'tea in the sahara'. i could not agree more. it's a fine song but it's so clearly not a part of the carefully structured narrative of 'synchronicity' i think it should be listened to separately. sounds like nitpicking, i know, call me a purist.
6305754969|4.0|If you like John Wayne and the classic western genre, you'll love this film. The cast is wonderful: John Wayne and Robert Mitchum (old friends and nemesis), James Caan (what a kid!), Ed Asner, and Christopher George.<br /><br />Wayne and Mitchum are a little long in the tooth and there is talk of settling down, but there are scores to settle and justice to enforce first.<br /><br />Near the end of the movie is a faux pas regarding crutches. Both the heroes are using crutches by this time and Mitchum mistakenly changes the side he's using. John Wayne picks up on the oversight and quips to Mitchum in an ad-lib ( I believe) that is very clever.<br /><br />John Wayne is thoroughly the \\"Duke\\" here - his swagger, tough talk, hard-bitten quips, and ironic surprise at everything that happens. I don't recall him being as \\"Himself\\" as he is in this movie.<br /><br />There are many comic moments amid the classic tale of hired guns, good versus evil, fights over water rights, and \\"top hand\\" winning the girl. All in all, a delightful film well worth watching.
B0006399FS|5.0|I've been trying to understand why the reviews are either 1-2 stars, or 5 stars.  People seem to love or hate this album.  Heres why, I think: <br /> <br />1.  Some people hate Bono because he is a public figure without having an office.  He is probably the most immensely successful frontman to a rock band, followed closely only by Steve Tyler from Aerosmith.  Some people have a problem with popularity.  At the first sign of being universally successful and popular and writing songs that people love, you're immediately a \\"sell-out.\\"   <br /> <br />2.  I dont think some people understand that a 25 year old rock band has defined what makes their fans loyal, and they LOVE the feeling of thousands a fans loving how they make them feel..and thats why U2 is writing music that fans will be drawn to...because ultimately they're doing it for themselves too. <br /> <br />3.  People just dont like them because they're still around and still the best. <br /> <br />My opinion of this album is that it is the 3rd best U2 album (the first two being Joshua Tree and Unforgettable Fire), and I think it is by far the most definitive U2 sound, even over The Joshua Tree.  Let me explain: <br /> <br />This is U2's 11th album.  This album strikes me as having taken the sound of all previous 10 albums and combining them into one album, and therefore defining U2's sound as a whole.  It has the rock elements from early U2 in Vertigo, the unique Edge and Larry Mullen sound from Unforgettable Fire and Joshua Tree, the Americanized sound from Rattle and Hum and the wonderful Adam Clayton bass sound from Achung Baby, Zooropa, and Pop.  Finally, they took the 4th era redefined U2 sound with ATYCLB and put all that into one album, and the outcome is by far one of their top 3 albums. <br /> <br />There is so much emotion in this album.  Death, love, politics, spiritualism...everything that U2 puts into an album is here.  Song evaluation: <br /> <br />1.  Vertigo..perhaps not the best first single orfirst song for the album, because it is a little misleading.  Its the only song like it on the album.  3.5/5 <br /> <br />2.  Miracle Drug...I dont really have to much to say on this song..its good, but certainly doesnt stand out too much.  3.5/5 <br /> <br />3.  Sometimes You Cant Make It On Your Own...wow...this is maybe the best power ballad in the library, surpassed only by With or Without You..it reminds me of the Joshua Tree and would have been perfect for that album.  2nd best on this album.  5/5 <br /> <br />4.  Love and Peace or Else...good song.  And who says this album has no experimental aspects?  The only really political song.  I'm not too big on the bridge though.  Could have been on the Rattle and Hum or Achtung Baby.  4/5 <br /> <br />5.  City of Blinding Lights...by far the best on the album and one of the best songs U2 have done.  Reminds me at times of Where the Streets Have No Name...Edge sounds great.  Also could have been on Joshua Tree.  5/5 <br /> <br />6.  All Because of You..good song overall.  the first few bars are fantastic.  I really cant stand the chorus though, but the verses and the coda of the song are great.  Great work by Edge here.  Could have been on Rattle and Hum.  4/5 <br /> <br />7.  A Man and a Woman...this is the most underrated song on this alum.  3rd best, in my opinion, and absolutely SEXY.  This song sounds like their Pop album to me.  The most unique sound on the album, and Adam really makes this song.  5/5 <br /> <br />8.  Crumbs From Your Table..I dont understand why people think this sound be a single.  Not nearly the calibur of City of Blinding Lights or Sometimes.  Theres nothing catchy about this one at all.  2/5 <br /> <br />9.  One Step Closer...this is a really boring song.  Nothing emotional here to me.  This is the lowest point of the album.  2/5 <br /> <br />10.  Original of the Species..a little better than the previous two, but this is a really sporatic song with a couple good melodies.  Not deservingof a single position though.  3/5 <br /> <br />11.  Yahweh...the first bars of this song remind me the most of any U2 album, and the entire song fits perfectly onto Unforgettable Fire..the problem here is that the song is the same thing over and over again, and therefore it receives. 3/5 <br /> <br />The only complaint that I have about this album is Bono's voice.  At times, it absolutely soars, such as in Sometimes You Cant Make It On Your Own in the really long, great bridge, or City of Blinding Lights, but a lot of times on the album he seems weak and thin.  I realize he is getting older and he wont have the power that he did in 1987, but I also think he's adjusting his singing style appropriately to his weakened voice..so it all works out. <br /> <br />Amazing album.  Hope I get a chance to catch them on this tour.
B000002G85|4.0|By 1970 Eric Clapton was a fixture in the rock scene, so it's interesting to note that this album was Slowhand's first 'solo' venture.  Of course 'solo' seldom means 'by yourself', and Eric has a wealth of remarkable talent surrounding him here.  The early 1970's seemed to be a fertile time for such comraderie.  Eric himself made recordings and concert appearances with artists such as Stephen Stills and George Harrison.  Stills, in fact, contributed guitar work to this album, while Clapton produced a torrid lead guitar solo on 'Go Back Home' for Stills' first solo album, also released in 1970.  Perhaps it was the success of 'Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young' that encouraged elite artists to form brief 'supergroups', such as Clapton did with Steve Winwood and Ginger Baker in the one-album-wonders 'Blind Faith'.   <br /> <br />Another early 1970's phenomenon which Clapton appeared to be ascribing to was the emergence of the singer-songwriter.  Artists such as Joni Mitchell and Carole King were serving as prototypes for fans who wanted to hear the songwriters spin their own compositions, even if their talents weren't the finest available.  Gone were the days of composers such as Laura Nyro handing over their best work to the likes of 'The Fifth Dimension'.  On this album Clapton teams with Bonnie Bramlett for six tunes, churns out another with Leon Russell, and pens one of the finest, and most risque works by himself.  Never before had Clapton, often content to cover classic blues tracks, made such a strong songwriting contribution. <br /> <br />A third clear influence on this release is the inclusion of a backing horn section, composed of Bobby Keys on sax and Jim Price on trumpet, on several tracks.  The success, and rather avant-garde sound of band's such as 'Blood, Sweat and Tears' and 'Chicago Transit Authority' had no doubt caught Clapton's ear, much as Stephen Stills was influenced on his first and second solo efforts.  While the horns are up-front and essential for the opening instrumental 'Slunky', their presence on some of the other tracks sounds more forced than necessary. <br /> <br />There are no bad tracks on 'Eric Clapton', but aside from 'Let It Rain' there aren't a lot of hum-dingers either.  The best song next to 'Let It Rain' is the familiar 'After Midnight'.  Next up would be Clapton's own 'Easy Now', with its tantalizing acoustic guitar melody and sensual lyrics (\\"Making love against the wall, feeling very small when we didn't need to be, easy now, don't let my love flow out of you, please remember that I want you to come too...\\").  Pretty risque for 1970. <br /> <br />Later in 1970 Clapton teamed up with Carl Radle, Bobby Whitlock, and Jim Gordon (all of whom appear on this disc) to form 'Derek and the Dominoes'.  Unfortunately(?), 'Derek and the Dominoes' live covers of two studio tracks from this disc, 'Blues Power' and 'Bottle of Red Wine', which can be found on the 'In Concert' and 'Live At the Fillmore' discs, render these versions obsolete.  This studio recording of 'Let It Rain' however does stand as the premier version of that track, one of Clapton's finest as a solo artist. <br /> <br />The remaining tracks, 'Bad Boy', 'Lonesome and a Long Way From Home', 'Lovin' You Lovin' Me' and 'I've Told You For the Last Time' are undistinguished despite the fine musicianship offered up by Clapton and others.  I enjoy Clapton's vocal style, but singing is the one area where Eric occasionally lacks the ability to put a mediocre song over-the-top, and this particular deficit shows up on the aforementioned tracks. <br /> <br />The remastering is nice, but as with many other CD's the producers missed the opportunity to expand the liner notes to make a complete package out of a production that many customers are purchasing for the second or third time.  A couple bonus tracks, alternate takes from the sessions, printed lyrics, a little additional history or just a bit of sweet reminiscence doesn't seem like too much toask.  Nevertheless, this remains a light, fun Clapton album, and that can't be said for most of his catlog, so often steeped in the classic blues.
B0002KVULG|5.0|I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was in the 11th grade. My friends and I loved it and went to see it 3 times. I bought the VHS version of the movie a few years ago and couldn't wait for the DVD version to be released. The color is just as I remember it - dark and moody. I wouldn't want to see it alive (no pun intended) with color - it would spoil the mood. The name of the movie is DRACULA - it should be spooky. Glad to see it was finally released on DVD.
B00005JLXE|4.0|With the influx of comic book adaptations in the past few years, \\"Daredevil\\" kind of got lost in the shuffle.  To my mind, it is one of the better screen treatments of a Marvel comic book to date.  The story and the backstory, for that matter, are utterly compelling.  Ben Affleck, an actor I normally loathe, actually delivers a multi-layered performance as the blind activist-lawyer by day, masked crusader by night.  Jennifer Garner is simply luminous as Electra.  The sky is the limit for Garner.  Colin Farrell, another actor who normally doesn't impress me, is charismatically comicly menacing as Bullseye.  Michael Clarke Duncan is fearsome as Kingpin.  This film didn't get great reviews on initial release and had kind of lukewarm box office.  \\"Daredevil\\" is definitely a film in serious need of re-evaluation.
B00068IOWC|5.0|However, I wanted to give Bono and the boys a chance.  I mean, after all, they did give me that kick arse \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" CD which, at the very least, rivaled their best earlier works.   <br />Thank God and the band for all they've given!  <br />I downloaded their newest CD off of their website link and I was so HAPPY, elated really.  I should have known better than to doubt U2's destiny of sheer excellence.   <br />I bought it as soon as I could and picked up a few extras to give out as gifts.  This is definitely the type of album you want to share with friends.  It would be a shame to keep it to yourself.  It's that good. <br />The album is vibrant, sexy, smart and simply an absolute pleasure to listen to.
B0002XDODU|5.0|If you buy this hoping for a repeat of Herzeleid or Mutter, then you'll be sorely disappointed. On this album they do mellow out - just a little bit. There's not as much growling. The keyboarding that made their previous albums so great is not as emphasised. There is, of all things, accordion on some songs here. But good bands evolve and that is what they are doing. Great buy if you welcome change in bands. Who wants the same sound over and over anyway; it gets stale.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I can't offer enough superlatives as to how good this film is.  This collaboration between director Robert Zemeckis and actor Tom Hanks is, in my mind, virtually flawless and a totally compelling viewing experience.  Those naysayers who would dismiss this film should recognize what a challenge this film is.  Zemeckis(and Hanks) are asking us to follow a story that asks us to follow the transformation of a man whose whole life revolves around punctuality and now finds himself with all the time in the world.  Tom Hanks gives probably his most challenging performance to date.  The scenes on the island where Hanks has few props to work with, if you count \\"Wilson\\" the volleyball, are just masterful.  Hanks uses his consummate skills as an actor to pull us in and never lets go.  Though this film was a box office success it received something of a lukewarm critical response.  I would hope that in years to come when the careers of Hanks(and Zemeckis) are evaluated that \\"Cast Away\\" is recognized for the great film that it is.
0805076476|5.0|I was pretty shocked when this was assigned to us as reading material in my College English class.  After all, I'd seen the movie before, and Fight Club wasn't exactly Shakespere.  I then found out that our teacher was rather liberalistic, and covered philosophical literature in class as well as literary classics.  Wow... Who woulda thought?  So, I ask someone what his higher-ups think about giving us this stuff, and I find out that they must really like it, since he's head of the english department.  Oh, well I guess I might actually learn something from this book, then. <br /> <br />That I did.  The book was completely mind-blowing, and then the teacher managed to point out some things that I missed, and I was shocked.  While this isn't exactly something you should follow to the letter, it has some great ideas about life and freedom.  But this is like many of the books I've read... You'll either hate it or love it, but there's very little in between.
0446614459|1.0|I love Baldacci's books, but this one really turned me off. There were times I wanted to just throw it and even more so at the end. What scares me, is he is talking about writing a sequel with these characters, which the characters are fine, but will the next story improve. I sure hope so and I am afraid to give it a chance as this one was so frustrating.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Correction to the review below. Plant and Page (also known as Led Zeppelin to you youngins) are not on the DVD, although one reviewer claimed (erroneously) they are. <br />Haven't see the video, but four stars for the effort and cause. Queen, U2 and The Who rocked. Saw it live on TV back in July 1985. <br />Peace
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This flick is outstanding in everyway and will have you riveted to your seat the whole movie.  Matt Damon has found a defining role and, hopefully, we will see him in a 3rd Bourne movie soon.  The car chase scene in Moscow was unbelievably intense, as was the fight scene in the german apartment.  Fantastic, yet believable, the Bourne Supremacy 'one-upped' the the Bourne Identity.  That was a hard feat in itself.  This is one of the great spy movie series ever made.  Make James Bond look like the cotton candy it is.
1591840562|5.0|If you have started a new business, or plan to, keep this book by your bed.  Trust me, you'll have lots of nights when you wake up in a cold sweat, staring at the ceiling and wondering what the heck you are supposed to do next.  Turn on the light and pick up this book. While it has a high-tech start-up-lingo-thing going on, don't worry about it...it's a brilliant book for any start-up.   I think Guy Kawasaki's \\"Red Pill\\" in the book is something that everyone should have posted in their office, on their bathroom mirror, on their computer....  Previously I had Steven Covey's 7 Habits in a frame on my desk but the 10 questions on Page 92 are even better.  It's tough love, it's the 'sounding board' most entrepreneurs don't have. <br /> <br />Gayle Hallgren <br /> <br />
B00004R99K|5.0|I think this movie is absolutly incredable. I grew up watching Disney movies because they took me to another world where i could be someone else for the moment. In this movie, I didn't just get to stay in the beast's castle, or under the sea, I got to make believe in bread butterflies, singing daisies, a mad tea party, and the coolest little caterpillar i've ever seen! Alice went on quite an adventure and I was happy to share in it with her. Alice reminds me of myself as a little girl. Always zoning out into another world when i'm supposed to be doing something important. Everyone go out and buy it if you havent already!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|It's hard to argue with the tracks included on this single disc collection, and it's really pointless to kvetch about which of your favorite Neil Young tracks got left off.  Odds are you have them all anyway. I know I do.  My only question is who was this CD compiled for? Obvioulsy his fans already have these songs. And with the most recent song on this disc dating from 1992 (\\"Harvest Moon\\"), it's unlikely that the casual fan was waiting twelve years for this to get released.<br /><br />Longtime fans who bought 1977's DECADE already have all but five of these songs. You know what I'm waiting for?  Where's DECADE II and III?  [In fact, Young is only three years away from being able to release DECADE IV.]<br /><br />And shouldn't this have been titled BEST OF instead of GREATEST HITS?  Sure, it includes all three of his early-seventies top 40 hits, but it omits other singles that charted in the hot 100 like \\"When You Dance I Can Really Love,\\" \\"Walk On\\" and \\"Four Strong Winds,\\" among others.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a terrific collection of songs with some of Young's most powerful anthems.  Five stars for the music, but I would think this is going to have limited appeal for anyone but the neophyte fan.
1400032717|3.0|This is a good book, but the astounding voice of the protaganist isn't quite enough to carry the flatness of other characters and events. <br /> <br />Christopher, the narrator of the book, is brilliantly drawn. His perceptions of the world describe his autism without condescendance. He is a profoundly sympathetic and real character. From the first page, it's clear that Christopher's inabilities to handle some sorts of complexities does not make him simple; and that nothing in his autism impinges at all on his bravery and steadfastness. <br /> <br />But as brilliant a job as Haddon does describing how Christopher sees, what he sees falls somewhat short. The non-autistic characters are thin and one-dimensional. This is particularly true of the secondary cast - the evil neighbor's husband, the wise and patient teacher, the gossipy old woman across the street. Often the non-Christopher characters seem unnaturally assembled expressly to voice some element of plot. Christopher's more abstract meditations also struck me this way - they seem out of sync with his voice in the rest of the story, more of a convienent holding place for a point Haddon is eager to make than an honest expression of character. <br /> <br />I definitely saw things in this book that showed an enormous amount of promise; I think Haddon has a really great novel in him, and as solid as this book is, this one isn't it.
B00005AQE8|5.0|pac is sooo damn good i have been a fan of his ever since this album came out and until now everytime i listen to this album i luv it more and more. How can someone have such great flow i really dont know, Ok there are lots of rappers around that have some songs with good lyrics but there is your keyword \\"SOME\\" but here \\"ALL\\" the songs are great this album is packed with super-hits, this rapper was simply too good to be true...... <br />Especially this album stays great...................... <br /> <br />Great Tracks are: <br /> <br />actually th are all great i dont to re-write them the are as you see them in the TrackListing....... <br /> <br /> <br />    ....................R.I.P.........................
0385510438|5.0|Let me start out by saying John Grisham does not write the type of books that usually interest me, but this had me page turning well into the night. <br /> <br />Danny Padgitt is sentenced to life for the murder of a young mother. After the trial he swear that he will take vengeance on the members of the jury that convicted him. <br /> <br />Nine years later, Padgitt is allowed out on parole and heading back for retribution . . .
B000089RVX|5.0|There is absolutely no comparison to the unique sound of Evanescence. The combination of Amy Lee's beautiful voice mixed with the alternative sound of guitar riffs and drums makes for a perfect album. Goth or not, this is flat out the best music I've ever heard. The band never tried to label themselves as anything. Every song on the CD is sensational, and in my opinion the best ones aren't even the ones played all the time on the radio! \\"My Last Breath\\" and \\"Going Under\\" have to be the top two, but all the rest are right up there. Their music is similar to Linkin Park, and if you're into them like I am you'll probably like Ev too. Amy's voice is quite a bit better than LP's lead singer, though. That's what sets them apart from all other alternative bands. So if you like alternative music and you want something fresh-sounding and different than all the other bands, you won't be disappointed with this CD!
B00005JL9B|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie. It is just so entertaining. I am in 9th grade so by the movie it is my age group which i guess makes it a bit more interesting to me. But this movie has everything, love gore humor. I  dont really know wat to say, its not for sensitive people but if themes dont really bother u than this is a must see. Kazuo is my all time favorite character too, Especially if u read the Novel, such an intersting character. Anyway, i would say that anyone who can take some blood and can get passed the fact its young teens killing eachother its an all around great movie.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Let me start off by stating for the record that I have not read any of the books.  I am going to soon read Goblet of Fire though after seeing this film...But...Now on to my review.  This has got to be one of the best fantasy films I have ever seen and I am a big fan of the genre.  I have not seen Y Tu Mama Tambien yet so I went into this film thinking it was going to be just another sequel in the series.  I thought the first films were good/entertaining but certainly not perfect and none of them were films I had any desire in buying or calling a personal favorite in any sense.  What was lacking in the first two for me was something that Chris Columbus used to do in his early screenplays (i.e. Gremlins, Young Sherlock Holmes)- Which was to give a child's fairy tale world a real sense of adult edge and dread.  All of that \\"edge\\" that was missing from the first two films can be found in this third installment by Cuaron.  What Cuaron does with this film is take it to a whole other level.  The effects are intense and hypnotic, the acting is above average this time out(some sincerely poignant moments in this one), the cinematography is some of the most beautiful I have ever seen, John William's score couldn't be better, and the production design/costumes/sets are overwhelmingly strong throughout.  Plus Gary Oldman was in it which is always a good thing.  This film and The Incredibles are the first movies in a long long time to make me feel like a kid again.  I am proud to give this film a HIGH \\"5\\" STAR recommendation.  If you saw the first two films and tuned out don't miss out on this incredible work of pop art. NOTE: Only thing bugging me now is that Cuaron is not returning to direct Goblet Of Fire which from what I understand is going to be helmed by Mike Newell who did Donnie Brasco (which is a great film to be sure)but two others he did \\"Four Weddings And A Funeral\\" and \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" are most certainly not.
B00068IOWC|1.0|This album is petty. The band doesn't show any skill here. The album is remarkably commercial. THAT'S SO ANNOYING !!! <br />U2 has no richness here, neither depth. U2 doesn't get through with this HTDAAB. <br />
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|A great first album from Franz, I must agree that this is a superb album and finally a decent Scottish band that's something to be proud of. Take me Out thugh did start out wonderful and then they turned to that thumping beat which was kind of dissapointing but you can let them off for that. All I can say to all of you is hahahaha because I'll be going to one of their Christmas shows in Glasgow!

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|thought I'd add a little more info to what Amazon has listed for y'all. <br />from nausicaa.net: <br />Two discs. Japanese and English audio with English subtitles. Extras include \\"Behind The Microphone\\" featurette, \\"Birth Story Of Studio Ghibli\\" featurette, original Japanese trailer, and complete storyboard-to-flim comparison.  <br /> <br />from me: <br />This is one of my favorite Miyazaki films.  You should also check out the manga series he originally wrote, of which the movie tells a fraction.  The epic story is by far the most wondeful yet undiscovered treasure of Japanese literature.
1400032717|4.0|Unlike others in today's sea of verbose novels of epic proportions, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is fresh and unique.  In fewer than 230 pages, and in a simplistic - often staccato - narrative, a story unfolds that is richer with detail and more poignant than in books containing pages of long-winded description. The main character, Christopher (Chris) Boone, cannot feel or express emotion; however, through his rudimentary account of events, the reader is able to SHARE his experiences and feel FOR him.  Another unique element of the book is Chris's \\"little digressions.\\"  In frequent insertions (right into the story), Chris solves math problems, recites his daily schedule, and draws pictures of constellations, floor plans, and fabric patterns.  These seemingly superfluous \\"addendums\\" further deepen our understanding of Chris's character - ostensibly uncomplicated, but in fact painfully complex.  Simple, and unassuming, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a joy to read, and a great example of how sometimes... less is more!
B00066N8JS|5.0|This remaster is superb!  I can only put to use the remastered stereo layer instead of the SACD layer, but even just the stereo layer has been remastered and tweaked to sound even better than the original did.  The highs are more crisp and the bass is more punchy, perfect for my listening tastes and perfect for my modest theater setup.   <br /> <br />The second disc contains B-sides and remixes most of us NIN fans have heard before, but it also includes three new to the public demos, which are a great treat to hear something \\"new-to-me\\" from Trent.   <br /> <br />I highly reccomend this album, even if you plan to use a non-SACD player.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This is truly one of the greatest films of all time. I have been watching this film since I was a little kid and it's never gotten old. Jim Henson and Brian Froud hae created a mystical, powerfull, and fantastical realy where spirituality and fantasy are intertwined in a way that few films have ever been able to do. The powerfull Mystics and the Dark Skeksis, each a balance to one another, when one dies so does the other. This balance of light and dark is a perfect symbol for lifes journey. This work must have been inspiried by the divine. When you watch this film, this epic film, pay close attention to the rich symbols in both the Mystic's realm and that of the Skeksis. There are so many geometric and magical patterns, symbols, and religous iconogrophy that one could make a study of the mythology of the world created herein. I highly reccomend anyone watch this movie over and over again. This is truth!

B0006399FS|5.0|Upon first listen last week I thought this album was U2's best-EVER! And then I came to this web site to see what other's thought. Wow! The U2 hater's club. Well, I re-evaluated figuring I got it wrong. A few days later I'm convinced. This is the best U2 album-EVER! Can't wait to hear these songs live.  <br /> <br />The album comes across as a Greatest Hits package except all the songs are new. \\"City Of Blinding Lights\\" ranks with any of the great U2 songs. My favorite, \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" should be a live classic. \\"Miracle Drug\\" is an expertly crafted tune, one of their best. Other songs on this album that rank as all-time U2 greats include \\"Original Of the Species\\" and \\"Man And A Woman\\".  <br /> <br />HTDAAB is not the cutting edge U2 but the crowd-pleasing epic anthems many of their 1980's albums contained. This album is a classic from the last pop/rock music superpower. <br /> <br />
B000007UA4|4.0|Most reviews on this very page agree with me that this is possibly the finest LP of Kylie's SAW period ... the \\"credible\\" music press certainly did, so I find it impossible to believe that anyone could think it was as bad as maybe two of the reviews would have you believe. This LP contains what I consider to be Kylie's most underrated single, \\"Word is Out,\\" (famously her first to miss the top ten)with its irresistible groove (the single version more so than the one here). \\"Finer Feelings\\" contains an impressive vocal that really demonstrates how Kylie's voice is much stronger than her early hits show. \\"Give Me just a Little More Time,\\" the Chairman of the Board classic, may be a paint-by-numbers cover, but it too has an unyielding clap-your-hands kind of beat to it, and fine piano work, which makes it sound like the famous production team really put more into the instrumentation of this remake than most of their covers. \\"Right Here Right Now\\" is a spirited kick-ass album track that could've been a single, and the final track, worth the price of admission alone, \\"I Guess I Like it Like That\\" shows that Stock Waterman could really let go when they wanted, and is one of the reasons I am a Kylie disciple;  the song could hold its own with any nineties disco anthem, and should make all wallflowers swamp the dancefloor. If you are going to have filler, then it might as well be \\"Let's Get to It,\\" with its shuffling rhythm and instrumental break, but \\"If You Were With Me Now,\\" the hit duet with Keith Washington, was not worthy of a single release in my book, and even comes across inferior to Kylie's earlier sappy duet, \\"Especially for You.\\" As an American fan, this album dates from the days when Kylie's output was only available to us stateside fans as an import. I know Yanks have a reputation of liking more R&B influenced music, but that is not the case with me, or why I recommend this album to all Kylie fans, new and old.  I tend to like Kylie's music best when she experiments and tests the boundaries, not content to rely on stale advice or past success, and \\"Let's Get to It\\" is a fine example of Kylie finally taking control.
B0006399FS|1.0|seeing is believing Bono. Where's \\"the best U2 album\\" ? <br />sadly, despite evidence, some fans turn a deaf ear, allowing Bono \\"sign\\" as horrible as he can.  <br /> <br />Nevermind this commercial joke. At least in Pop Bono had passion and emotion, despite his voice, and the song sounded extraordinary anyway, because of its great melodies. <br /> <br />Bono displays an awful degree in his voice here, and the songs are tuneless. <br /> <br />
1400082773|5.0|This book is not what you may expect. It isnot a self-agrandizing autobiography about personal achievement. It is about the struggle of one man, an man representative of the American struggle of self, family, class, and in some ways --race.  This is an American \\"must read.\\" I highly recommend this  book for all African-Americans and multi-ethnic people. Sen. Obama has a deep and honest view of the struggles people have about themselves.
B00005U11Z|5.0|This DVD is what got me back into Journey, after years of having lost touch with my favorite band of all time. I have seen it literally hundreds of times, and it never ever gets old. If you have not seen JOURNEY with Steve Augeri as the lead vocalist, then you have not seen JOURNEY! The band goes on today, rocking better than ever. Thanks to Neal, Ross, Jon, Deen and Steve A. WE LOVE YOU GUYS! Melanie
B0006399FS|4.0|I remember one guy saying back in the mid 80's that U2 could become the next Beatles. In time, they really didn't and we came to understand that the Beatles were unique. But what U2 did become is the coooooolest band in the world. OK, the Stones are \\"bigger\\", but U2 are the coolest (they even have their own ultracool iPod). So what could U2, after more than 20 years, need to prove or experiment? This album is plain, good ol' , fun, kicking rock n' roll at it's best. The album does follow the stablished 1-2 of  rock, that is release a great album (All That You Can't...) and then repeat the recepie (for example: Red Hot Chili Peppers-Californication-and then-By The Way). The end result is great. \\"Atomic Bomb\\" will not change music history, but it's good to know that Rock n' Roll is alive and well. Overall, it's one of U2s best albums, highly recommended.
0395389496|5.0|My three year old son is addicted to his trains.  This book was another addition to his collection.  He loves the book, he wants to read it every night.  He saw the movie this week and is even more in love with the book.  Beautiful illustrations and a wonderful story!
B0006399FS|4.0|I'll make this short: I've loved U2 since I first heard them in 1986.  I love mostly their ability to inspire--to communicate spiritual and emotional truths artfully and powerfully.  In the 90s, they lost me a little--oh, there's great stuff to be sure on \\"Pop\\" and \\"Zooropa\\", but the cynicism and the rock star attitude, satirical though it may have been, were not my cup of tea.  Their last studio album, All that You Can't Leave Behind was a return to the U2 I love, and though it was far from perfect--the 2nd half drags in my mind--it produced some great songs, including \\"Walk On,\\" which might be my favorite U2 song ever.  And I think this album is better.  Songwriter Michael W. Smith was in Ireland for a session with U2, and Bono asked him, \\"How do you dismantle an atomic bomb?\\"  Smith said he didn't know, and Bono replied, \\"With love, love, love.\\"  And that sums up this album.  It's not the straight out rock album that had been promised, but each song is well crafted (though I do agree that Bono's voice is starting to go a little), and a little more uptempo and grand than the songs on ATYCLB.  The theme is indeed love, and how it can bridge the gap between a man and his father (\\"Sometimes You Can't Make It\\"), between a man and God (\\"All Because of You\\", \\"Yahweh\\") and a man and a woman (\\"A Man and a Woman\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights.\\")  There's even a challenge to the church to rise up and take on the cause of Africa (\\"Crumbs From Your Table.\\")  No, it's not the absolute classic the Joshua Tree was, but these are well-done, catchy pop-rock songs about themes that actually matter.  What's wrong with that?  Even after reading some of these lousy reviews, I have no idea.

B0006399FS|5.0|Just because this new U2 album dousn't have a \\"new, remarkable sound\\", dousn't mean it not a work of art. Think about it...\\"All that you can't leave behind\\" is a hard album to follow up. If \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" came out in 2000, and \\"All that you can't...\\" came out in 2004, \\"How to Dismantle...\\" would be known as a break through album, and there last album would be known as okay. This is a time that I think U2 are far from selling out. They just did what they could (artistically), and they created a really good album.
B00004YKUY|2.0|While some would argue that Journey existed before Steve Perry showed up, the truth is that Journey was a talented group of musicians without the voice or song writing ability needed to be successful.  Then came Steve Perry, and the rest is history.... They have returned to their former selves (pre-Perry), only this time they try to sing and write.  It was a dissaster.  To support this argument I give you their tours.  They are still singing all of the old Perry stuff, because they know that fans do not like the new stuff.  The truth is, this album is a stinker.  The positive reviews the new Journey is getting is not reflected in their record sales, and this leads most to believe that the positive reviews are less than genuine.  Journey fans would have been much better served with more studio albums that include Perry and not this NEW BAND that is pretending to be Journey. <br />
0395389496|5.0|If you love your children get this book and read it to them -- over and over again. We got ours when it first came out and before it had won awards or been recognized for the wonderful book that it is. It will be read again on December 23 this year ('Twas The Night Before Christmas has a lock on Christmas Eve). All of my children and now my grandchildren love it and all but the youngest have it memorized. The sweetness of the minds and hearts of the little ones themselves is the only thing on earth that is better than this story. In case you cannot tell, I truly believe.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Great music from one of country's finest.  This is a must CD for anyone wanting to hear all of Shanias' hit songs in one place or want great upbeat music.  Some of the finest country music can be found here - for all ages. <br />Charlie Warner <br />
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|A collection of all of our favorite Shania hits on one CD! It's hard to get enough of it. All of the classics are included as well as three new songs. Which I'm sure will be hits of their own in the near future. An excellent addition to anyone's album collection!
0743201140|4.0|I was recommended by a friend to read this book. infact, I borrowed it. <br /> <br />When it comes to discover personal strenghts, I think this book has really done a wonderful job. And it also touches psychological aspects.
B000063WDH|5.0|In the Black Key's first album \\"The Big Come Up,\\" the Akron, Ohio based duo slaps together a pretty damn good rock album.  At first listen, it takes only a moment to realize that amidst the glut of electronically enhanced alternative rock, and low-fi indie punk we rock fans have grown accustomed to and which music critics laud, the Black Keys have taken the opposite route, and embraced all that has made rock n' roll great in the first place.<br /><br />Rock fans will instantly recognize how the Key's have come so far so fast...they are experts at building upon what we all like most about rock - catchy guitar riffs, raw and moving vocals, some blues sensibility, and solid drums that propel songs along.  The result? Forty minutes of invective, head-nodding rock n' roll.<br /><br />Here, the Keys show not only their influence and respect for their forefathers (Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Guy), but they also dangle a little fodder for the Beatles fan in all of us by sneaking in a cover of \\"She Said, She Said\\" (number nine on this album).<br /><br />Dan Auerbach & Patrick Carney have stepped away from the post-punk experimentation that today's rock fans gotten lost in, slapped us across the face, woken us up, and brought us back to what we loved most about rock in the first place.<br /><br />Throw this CD in, turn it up, and enjoy!
B000088E6P|5.0|great cd  every song is worth the money.    every song is good.    buy this if u don't have it    clean or explicit version dosent matter
B00004U5SC|5.0|Growing up in the 1960's, television westerns such as Gunsmoke, The Rifleman, Wagon Train, and Bonanza etc., etc, etc, were a major part of my TV viewing diet, and for many years Shane did not seem to match them. But a few years ago I watched Shane from start to finish and discovered what a superb movie it really is. Alan Ladd portrays Shane perfectly as a confident, quiet loner, and his cool, subtle style really brings out the true nature of this movie. What also helps define Shane as a classic western is a strong supporting cast highlighted by Jack Palance's performance as Jack Wilson. The theme music by Victor Young, the direction of George Stevens, the Grand Tetons as a backdrop, and the screenplay by A.B. Guthrie Jr pave the way for a great western adventure. John Wayne may be the king of movie westerns, but Alan Ladd as Shane is also part of the royal family.
B00004T9UF|4.0|this i a great cd. im a huge eminem fan. This is  his 2nd best cd. Encore is the best. The treasn i only giv it four stars is because i can't listen to every song.  My favoite songs are kill you, stan, who knew, the real slim shady, the way i am, and under the influence.(great and funny song) If u dont have this buy it immedietly. but dont buy the clean version. only buy the explicit verson. the clean version(i dnt have but i heard about it)scrambles the wrong words and it sounds hribble . <br /> <br />Overoll it was great.
B0006399FS|4.0|\\"I'm at a place called Vertigo...\\" shouts Bono, opening the first track and hot single, \\"Vertigo\\" which reminisces the older U2, feeding off raw and driving energy. Bono's vocals are soaring, quick and smart. The Edge presents himself as the cutting through the air, raw, grinding and revving guitar guru. Adam Clayton pounces each line of his bass with a thick, heavy beat. Larry Mullen Jr keeps ontop with his quick, hard hitting beats. <br /> <br />And that's just one song... <br /> <br />It's been 4 years since the last studio album from U2 and we finally get our hands on new material. We were last left with two new songs, \\"Electrical Storm\\" and \\"The Hands That Built America\\" which seemed to hint that gone were the days of U2's fist pumping, flag waving rebel days of rock and roll. However, U2 too the energy, the passion and the lyrical mindset and brought it back with a new sound. <br /> <br />The results are well drawn out, thoughtful songs, crafty, catchy and rocking. \\"Miracle Drug\\" a song about a former Mount Temple student who was diagnosed with a brain disease, tried a new drug / machine that allowed him to regain control of his body and become a best selling novelist. \\"The sun is in your eyes, I'll see them when you rise, I've had enough of romantic love, yeah, I'd give it up for a miracle drug.\\" A song that tells a story, with driving force. Songs such as \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" with it's brilliant, uplifting chorus, \\"Oh you look so beautiful tonight! In the city of blinding lights.\\" With it's driving, uplifting, and lush keyboard and guitar pieces. To \\"All Because You\\" with it's fast paced, hip, let all loose feel. To \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" a bittersweet, melodic, guitar laiden carving from the Edge and Larry Mullen's top notch drumming. Bono questions \\"You speak at the signs of wonder, I need something other, I would believe, if I was able, but I'm waiting from the crumbs from your table.\\" <br /> <br />Yet, we also see a softer side of U2. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" a ballad about Bono's father who passed away in 2001 (before their Slane gig) Bono sings of anger, then of pleading and finally of acceptance. \\"And it's you when I look in the mirror, and it's you when I pick up the phone.\\" Constantly reminded of his father, missing him every second that he lives. Another song, \\"A Man and A Woman\\" has Bono discussing the problems and questions that drive men and women to love one another. As if love is a foreign concept for Bono, \\"Though I could never understand, the mysterious distance, between a man and a woman.\\" Bono lets out a falsetto, as if the song feels like a daydream, thinking about a loved one, perhaps after an argument. <br /> <br />U2 called up Brian Eno again to produce the ambient begging, \\"One Step Closer\\" a gloomy, atmospheric number with a tribal feel towards the end. It continues with a song called \\"Original Of The Species\\" a sweeping, melody, bittersweet song about the needs of a person. \\"You are the first one of your kind\\" sings Bono, about a particular person (or child) who desires an object. The album ends with \\"Yahweh\\" a ringing, melodic, imagery felt song, reminscent of the Joshua Tree era, mixed with a \\"Walk On\\" feel to it. In the song, Bono sings to God to rebuild himself, and forgive him for what he has done in his daily life. <br /> <br />These songs hint that at in their late 40s, U2 can still pull off a raw riff, with distortion. Edge presents us with new riffs, which is refreshing considering some of the songs on the radio we hear today -- seem to copy riffs from one another. Clear and crisp vocals, keyboarding and guitar work make these songs stand out. Edge cuts through the air, as if his guitar were a samurai sword. Adam Clayont's bass is thick, heavy and on time with the song, keeps your pulse going and keeps you on track with the songs. Larry Mullen's drumming is powerful, almost tribal like and always on top of every song. Pick up this album, it will certainly feellike a new era for U2. Melodic, driving, and passionate music, a rarity in today's music business.
B0006399FS|3.0|The riddle implied in the title of U2's new album is followed by the answer: Don't build one. That is, you dismantle the atomic bomb by not building one. Clever huh? It's too bad there was nothing as sonically shattering here as an atomic bomb to begin with. But I digress, \\"Atomic Bomb\\" is really not a bad record. Actually, I think overall it's better and more consistent than ATYCLB. The problem is, we've been tainted because the U2 we've come to know and love is exciting, edgy (no pun intended), and has a somewhat irreverant punk sensibility. The last two albums just haven't had those characteristics. Those albums kind of showcase the Edge's songwriting ability, which is just dandy, but the records overall are just not exciting. Sadly, it seems as though this will be the last \\"version\\" of U2 we see. Don't expect them to go Zooropa on us at this point.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I deeply recommend to take a look at this incredible selection of Michael' songs, including some amusing and brand new takes like \\"We've had enough\\" which has been recorded this very year!. The DVD of the Dangerous World Tour in Bucharest shows Michael amazing and gravity defiant talent into movement, in one of his best perfomances ever. This Box Set shows Michael's evolution, from the Motown sound to his more personal and creative compositions.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I was so pleased to see that Journey was touring again. In October, 1999, I saw them live and fell in love with the boys all over again. Steve Augieri opened his mouth and the place went wild (Upper Darby, PA). Deen rocked so hard, I thought he would break his drum kit! The DVD was just icing on the cake. I still listen to all of Steve Perry's music, however, Steve Augieri is different and brings a fresh light in to this wonderfully talented group. I still love listening to Steve Smith and his music as well as the original music with Greg Rollie. There's more to life than the same old thing. If you haven't seen or heard the new lineup, you've missed a great experience. This DVD is certainly one you shouldn't miss!! <br />JerseyJourneyJunkie
B000060P79|4.0|I liked the CD as most of it is pretty catchy. I loved \\"Addicted\\" when I first heard it on the radio and decided to get the CD. I'm a bit over the teenage issues, but their target audience is not so I can't blame them for that. If you like pop-punk then you'll enjoy the CD. <br />The negative reviews are always the same. The spelling is laughable, capital letters rarely begin a sentence, and punctuation is almost non-existant. I don't see how such reviews can ever be helpful. I know that I certainly wouldn't put much credit in a review that looks like it was written by a whiny elemantry student. If you don't like the CD, at least make your review worth taking into consideration.
B00005JLEX|5.0|In the wise words of Don Imus... \\"I've never met a smart person who didn't have a sense of humor.\\"   I say amen to that and quite honestly reckon that what we witnessed on our TV screens for what now seems like 9 very short seasons was a sort of pure, \\"whipped up out there somewhere in the stars\\" kind of entertainment genius that TV in it's current apocalyptic preoccupation with reality dribble and cookie cutter sit-coms may sadly never capture again.  But thank the almighty we can now unleash this comedic lightning in a bottle whenever we need a crack like fix of \\"nothing\\" by just dropping a DVD into a tray, dimming the lights and pretending it's Thursday night in 1991 all over again.  You know honestly I'm a bit suspicious as to the motives of people who would waste their time writing a review about something they obviously don't get and know very little about, I know \\"nothing\\" and subtlety are hard concepts to grasp sometimes but if you let yourself go and quit waiting for someone to lead you to the \\"one-liners\\" to drink you might just appreciate the fact that Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David figured that the audience was smart enough to get \\"it\\" without \\"it\\" being shoved down their collective throats.  They understood that the laughs and loyalty they would earn by not dumbing the whole process down by resorting to pathetic ratings period tricks like offering viewers \\"an emotional Seinfeld we'd never forget\\" or having Elaine and George get married in the season finale' to find out next season it was all just some twisted dream sequence would be much more rewarding in the end.  I guess it's sort of like when they say you should never talk about politics or religion at a dinner party, I think I'll ad Seinfeld to that list, bottom line is, if people don't get it, they never will so why argue the facts?  It's just a dirty shame they find themselves prisoners of such a bleak humorless little rock of a planet.  Now as far as the DVD goes, even without the fantastic extra's (which go to 11) it's Seinfeld on DVD... `nough said!  Heck I would have been satisfied if they'd released it dubbed in Bulgarian and had packaged the whole thing in smelly old mildew ravaged newspaper!  And that thing about smart people having a sense of humor... I guess the fact that I love this DVD and can't get enough Seinfeld makes me a freaking genius, a genius that can't spell mind you, but a genius that knows how to laugh!
031286504X|5.0|Only one guy left on earth, trying to survive.  Should be boring, but it isn't.  Instead the novel becomes a type of modern-day Crusoe as the main character tries, day by day, to improve his living conditions and gain more essential knowledge about the creatures that stalk him by night.  As you can imagine, many things need to be taken care of to ensure this man stays alive; food must be procured, shelter must be protected, travel arranged, water source provided, etc.  This isn't a vampire story; it's a story about survival.

B00005JN4O|4.0|Peter Pan soars; Finding Neverland kind of hops along, sometimes airborne, sometimes very earthbound.  The highlight is certainly the last 20 minutes or so, with the opening night performance of Barrie's play and then the private staging of it at the Davies home.  Much of the rest of the elegantly staged and acted film feels exactly that way -- a collection of set pieces laid end to end for a couple hours.  Peter Pan is all about play, energy and imagination but even when playing Johnny Depp and the Davies boys seem more like they are working than having fun.  (What looks like the most fun, in fact, is the game the boys are playing when young Michael is found beneath Barrie's park bench.)  Depp is more burdened and tired than mischievous and flighty in his interpretation of Barrie -- and that may be exactly right, but again, it's not exactly fun.  In Barrie's increasingly loveless marriage, all this viewer's sympathies lie with his wife.  His neglect of her is shameless and selfish, as is his reaction when -- after being away from home night after night with the Davies -- he comes home to find that she once, once!, has chatted late into the night with a male visitor who came looking for Barrie.  And Kate Winslet has little to do but look, first, overwhelmed by four active boys and then consumptive -- which she does quite fetchingly.  My question is whether there has ever been a more \\"she's a goner\\" movie cough than the one Winslet produces as she and Depp are walking to watch a play her sons have staged.  Dustin Hoffman, on the other hand, has a wonderful time playing the role of Barrie's long-suffering producer.  And it's too bad we can't all age as well as Julie Christie, who also has a great time with her disciplinarian Grandma part.  <br /> <br />Historically very inaccurate, Finding Neverland is entertaining and worth seeing, but not the monument of cinema it sets itself to be.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005UKKF|2.0|Ok, this is a LIVE concert on DVD. In a huge arena. And... <br />SHE MIMED THE ENTIRE THING. <br /> <br />Thousands of people are spending quality time and money to see Britney Spears perform. We need to hear her ACTUAL SINGING voice. <br /> <br />NOT a CD version that everyone has heard 100 times. <br />I knew Britney was going to mime, but I didn't expect her to mime THE ENTIRE THING. <br /> <br />She is good at dancing though. If she doesn't want to get so puffed out on stage I suggest that she should quit smoking. <br /> <br />The dance moves and stage props and the whole set up was really good, but if there's one thing I expect out of concerts it is the SINGING.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|I have to say...before the Matrix Revolutions came out I felt like the Matrix series would be the \\"Star wars\\" of our generation (notice I don't call Star Wars Ep. 1 and 2 that...) The first 2 Matrixs are BRILLIANT and they could have made the last one the greatest of them all...especially with a name like \\"the Matrix Revolutions\\"...we're expecting a brilliant social commentary tied into a conversation on the nature of reality using religious metaphors (which I get except for \\"Nebekanezzar\\" which was an evil Babylonian king that took over Israel and enslaved the Jews...explain that you frikkin' Warshowski brothers!) like the first 2 except with more answers and fewer questions.    After 6 months of waiting I finally watch \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\". And it answers NONE of the fundamental political and philosophical questions it raises in the first 2 movies...on the nature of choice and how our choices in this society are false illusions to keep us controlled, what reality is and whether it exists outside of our senses, the reason for being and the nature of consciousness...not to mention the discussion in it on the nature of exploitation and why so many of us are OK being exploitated. The third installment lacks an answer to any of this and instead is an action film with some of the most stunning visuals ever created and with vague religious imagery that looks great but probably means nothing. The dialogue is poor, the defense of Zion is more like a military defense than a mass, popular mobilization like I had hoped...and it solves all the questions in plot flatly and obviously.  The final scene with them flying around in the rain is just awesome...but it's pointless. And Keanu's final \\"because I choose too\\" to answer all the philosophical issues raised by the first 2 movies is about as moving as a Mandy Moore movie.    Now the Warshowskis claim that it was \\"supposed to be open ended\\" so that they could put a Matrix RPG live internet game out (which is STILL not out..although I refuse to pay monthly to play a video game)...personally I think that they just didn't know what to write in answer to their own questions.  It's alot easier to be against something than to be for something, and so they leave us angry but confused, like radical teenagers.  So they are [...]because they act like it's our fault we don't glean the full message from the movies...BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT IN THERE.    Still, although the last installment gave me a sour taste in my mouth...these films are far better than most films out there in nearly every respect...and it seems like there are few movies out there that aren't copying their style and direction...so kudos to you you f-ing [...]! I can't wait til your next film.

B00065U08Q|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of John Frusciante's work.<br /><br />I have all his albums, I can play most of his songs.<br /><br />But this release left me deeply disappointed.<br /><br />First of all John's vocal work on the \\"walls\\" and \\"afterglow\\" did not impress me, although according to previous reviews it was supposed to be good.<br /><br />The songs sound too much alike, and constantly fail to arouse a feeling even anywhere close to what other records did. The only decent song is \\"my life\\" and even that is just decent.<br /><br />I appreciate josh klinghoffer's collaboration and input, but in my opinion releasing a cd where all/almost all songs are his is going a bit too far.<br /><br />I hope John's next release will have what we all love about him: amazing guitar work, and ever improving vocals.<br /><br />  Meanwhile I regret spending money on this cd, after one run in my stereo its going to the bottom of the pile, and in goes \\"to record only water for ten days\\".<br /><br />John please come back.
B00005JNEI|5.0|First of all, I waited until after the election to purchase this DVD and watch it. From all of the hype, I didn't want a film to determine who I voted for as the next president of the United States of America.  After watching Fahrenheit 9/11 with my entire family, I was saddened before that George W. Bush was in office, but now, I am more saddened that he is.  Moreso, I am disappointed in the American people who truly believe this film has no value to it and who choose to believe this was soley an attempt for Michael Moore to make money.  Maybe it was, or maybe it wasn't.  Who cares?  The fact is, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there's certainly some truth to this story. We as American Citizens owe it to ourselves to know the truth about the individuals who hold the key to this country's future. In addition, we owe it to ourselves to make sure this country is headed in the right direction for our children...their children, etc. Michael Moore did a superb job educating, not pursuading, coaxing or manipulating me into what he wanted me to see, but instead he educated me on what I needed to know as an African American Citizen living in the United States today. I truly thank him for the \\"eye opening course\\" and I encourage everyone to purchase this DVD for educational purposes as well. It will certainly wake you up. Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, Black, White, Hispanic...whatever, we are still Americans who deserve to know the truth about our leaders. I encourage you to open your eyes because there's no doubt we're moving in the wrong direction. Isn't it time that we got back on the right track?  I'd say America is well over due...wouldn't you?  Thanks Mr. Moore for a true lesson in history.
0142000663|4.0|A required book is always a drag believe it or not, but the The Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, was a different story from the beginning. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, who travels to California during the Great Depression (1930's. During their trip to the great land of California the Joad family goes through sadness, happiness and obstacles all while migrating to California. Once they arrive to California they are faced with racism in their own country. The attention-grabbing novel had the Joad family face racism, while migrating from Oklahoma to California. They are referred to as \\"okies\\".<br /><br />The heartfelt story that may relate to many people also had a twist. While traveling to California the Tom Joad, one of the main characters is faced with his past and reflects on it while making the journey. He was faced with jail, and knows that he can't be seen doing anything wrong. Scared of being caught or thrown in jail once again he and his family move on even thought they had already found a pleasant place to settle.<br /><br />This book deals with issues such as discrimination. In the novel the Joad family is faced with discrimination. They are lied to when they try to get a job, they are called \\"okies\\" and they are evicted from the land they travel from. This novel isn't all negative. Steinbeck also shows how the migrating families help each other by creating communities over night and then moving on, and every night communities are set up, and everyone gets along, and no one is left in hunger.<br /><br />This novel may be required in High School, but it is also a great book to read on your free time. Enjoy this incredible book, while learning the struggle of families that migrated during that era and still migrate with the same hope and dream of having a better life for themselves and their loved ones. This book deserves four out of five stars.<br /><br />Eder Gaona

B00004U2GH|5.0|This expanded reissue of Johnny Cash's 1969 concert at San Quentin is one of the very few country records I own.  It is also one of the best, most intense and inspired live albums I have ever heard.    \\"Johnny Cash At San Quentin\\" is one of Cash's very best records, and one of the very few to truly capture the darkness and rage that lies deep in his music. Blending the worldweariness of country with the bluntness of folk music and the roughness of rock n' roll, he makes even the most traditional country cliches sound sincere and believable.  Johnny Cash careens through a series of ballads, spirituals, and rockabilly ravers, taking full advantage of the unusual circumstances. He draws energy from the audience, creating an incredibly intense atmosphere which results in one of the rawest and most stimulating performances you'll ever hear.    The imposing Johnny Cash imbues even a novelty song like \\"A Boy Named Sue\\" with real passion, proving beyond a doubt that true style and conviction will get you further than any amount of showmanship.  This is a truly superb performance. I'm not really a country music fan, but I'm a fan of Johnny Cash!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|MICHAEL JACKSON  <br /> <br />\\"The Ultimate Collection\\"  <br /> <br />Epic, four CDs and one DVD; $59.98  <br /> <br />Here's your chance to help defray some of Jackson's mounting legal fees. \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" retraces the Uni- Glover's 40-year career to date, from Jackson 5 prodigy (\\"I Want You Back\\") to \\"Thriller\\"-era powerhouse (\\"Billie Jean\\") to 21st-century pariah (\\"Unbreakable\\"). The DVD features highlights from a 1992 concert by Jackson in Bucharest, Romania.  <br /> <br />Total tracks: 57 (13 previously unreleased).  <br /> <br />Nice touch: Jackson's demo for \\"We Are the World,\\" the 1985 charity single he co-wrote with Lionel Richie.  <br /> <br />The perfect gift for: The King of Pop's loyal subjects, if he has any left. <br />
B000028U0Y|5.0|I'm not much of a country music fan, but I've always had an affinity for the late, great John R. Cash. And this 1968 concert album is one of his very best records, combining the resignation and worldweariness of country with the bluntness of folk music and the roughness and rebelliousness of rock n' roll.  Johnny Cash takes full advantage of the unusual circumstances, drawing energy from the literally captive audience, and creating an intense atmosphere which results in one of the most raw and stimulating performances you'll ever hear.  (\\"This show is being recorded for an album released on Columbia Records\\", Cash says, \\"-so you can't say hell or s**t or anything like that!\\")    Country weepers like \\"I Still Miss Someone\\" and \\"Green, Green Grass Of Home\\" may have seemed smaltzy if performed by an artist with less panache, but the imposing Johnny Cash imbues every song with dignity and sincerity.  Almost all of the nineteen songs performed has do to with death, prison, violence, drugs, loneliness, loss and regret, but \\"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison\\" never becomes morose; Cash delivers songs like \\"Cocaine Blues\\", \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"The Wall\\" and \\"25 Minutes To Go\\" with conviction and a singular mix of seriousness and dark, acerbic humor. One of the finest records of the 60s, and a must-have for anyone even remotely interested in the music of Johnny Cash, \\"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison\\" is one live album which truly couldn't have been created in the studio.    \\"In plain terms, Johnny was and is the North Star. You could guide your ship by him...the greatest of the greats then and now\\"  (-Bob Dylan)
B0006399FS|5.0|I've been listening to U2 since 1983's War.  My personal impression is that the very best U2 LPs have a unique energy, sound, and confidence.  How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb delievers.     Personally, I feel that U2's best works have been: Boy, Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby.  Unforgettable Fire, Pop (not all U2 fans panned this LP, thank you!), and War would be the second tier, for me.  HTDAAB definitely joins the top tier.      The tempo is quickened thanks probably to Steve Lillywhite's production, the guitar hooks are jamming, the bass lines are fantastic -- really very, very good bass lines--, Bono's lyrics are pretty good throughout, sometimes wrenchingly insightful.    My favorite tracks thusfar: Miracle Drug, Love And Peace Or Else (a great groove, bold, and loaded with attitude), City of Blinding Lights, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own.    Worth the purchase.
6305718954|5.0|I borrowed this from my brother when i first got a DVD player. A week later, i purchased my own copy. Not as gory as alot of movies out thre today, and for that i'm grateful. There is blood, but it could have been alot worse.<br /><br />The story: A young woman named Frankie recieves a gift from her mother, whos vacationing. Weird things start to happen. Soon, Frankie, who states she doesn't believe in God, is manifesting signs of the stigmata. Much to the confusion of Father Kiernan, since only deeply religious people have ever gotten the stigmata. It starts a chain of events as they both attempt to figure out what's going on. It gets alot better from there.
B00005Y7AW|4.0|The second album from Rufus Wainwright was a quantum leap from the disjointed debut. The songs on \\"Poses\\" fit seamlessly next to each other, giving this Cd the feel of a conceptual whole. Rufus took the effort to hone in on his strengths here, and it makes \\"Poses\\" a far more rewarding listen.<br /><br />As he chronicles on the opening \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,\\" overindulgence often gets the better of him. It's a familiar terrain for this disc, be it the dark cloud that hovers over the peppy \\"California\\" or the confused soul at the heart of \\"Rebel Prince.\\" Rufus' character studies (which are wonderfully realized on both of his \\"Want\\" albums) reached the levels of his parents' best work here. Perhaps the most profound example of this is the melancholic title song, tracking the general shallow disdain of the too-chic-for-their-own-good urban hipsters. (As other reviewers have noted, it made a perfect coda to an episode of \\"Queer As Folk's\\" second season.)<br /><br />\\"I did go from wanting to be someone<br /><br />now I'm drunk and wearing flip flops on fifth avenue.<br /><br />Once you've fallen from classical virtue<br /><br />won't have a soul for to wake up and hold you.\\"<br /><br />It's a fate that Rufus allegedly fell into between this disc and \\"Want One,\\" but he made the trap sound so sweet and inviting. His voice gained expressiveness for \\"Poses,\\" even if it meant losing some of the boyish clarity of the debut, it has also made him a more emotive singer (and continued to grow in ability after this CD). Rufus Wainwright may have made a lot of changes for \\"Poses,\\" but he kept his uniqueness. In an age of cookie cutter pop and writing, that is the greatest virtue of them all.
B00006FIAZ|5.0|Dissection is a Legendary Metal band who only has two full length releases that are both praised as classics. The Somberlain is the first release of the two. This is truly a dark and wonderful album. The Somberlain has some of the most sorrowful guitar riffs I've ever heard. This is a long album with epic songs and stays entertaining all the way through. Almost every track contains some great acoustic passages, a lot of time changes and great keyboard work. The production is perfect! Not under or over produced and still has a very raw feel to it. This is as Dark and Cold as it gets Ladies and Gentlemen. Dissection really executes a chilling masterpiece. If your a fan of Black Metal or any other genre of Metal, this is a must have. If you're a fan of Dissection, check out Dark Fortress!
B00005R0VU|4.0|I have a special place in my heart for this quirky melding of synth-pop and sci-fi. To me, it ranks with the Alan Parsons Project's \\"I Robot\\" and Kraftwerk's \\"Man Machine\\" as the perfect mesh of human and android musicality. Given that the novelty status of The Buggles will forever be secured by \\"Video Killed the Radio Star,\\" that may come as a hard pill to digest. But there was much more to \\"Living In The Plastic Age\\" than that wonderful single.<br /><br />There was a fair amount of imagination involved with the making of this album. Horn and Downes obviously, in retrospect, had a lot more ambitions than making cotton candy new wave. If you listen to the lyrics, you'll find fear of the Reagen/Thatcher power mongering of the time (\\"Clean Clean\\"), wariness of technology isolating people from humanity (\\"I Love You Miss Robot\\"), and the title track's cynical look into a future of replaceable parts and governmental control.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the album did suffer from the fact that neither Horn nor Downes was much of a singer. While that lends a certain charm to a song like \\"Elstree,\\" it does suck the power out of \\"Kid Dynamo,\\" which really would have been more convincing if the vocal had more muscle. (In fact, I remember the shock of many of my friends when it was announced that Horn and Downes had been recruited for Yes...how the heck could the singer on this record possibly stand in Jon Anderson's space?) Regardless of the performance weaknesses, \\"Living In The Plastic Age\\" sounds better after the 20 plus years since its release than, say, A Flock Of Seagulls, and, as a document of Men Vs Technology, still stands strong.<br /><br />PS: I also recommend Bruce Wooley and The Camera Club's \\"English Garden\\" CD in addition to \\"Living in The Plastic Age.\\" He was a founding member of the Buggles and cowrote some of their best songs, but broke off before they hit. His versions of \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" and \\"Clean Clean\\" are played as straight ahead power pop and can be found on his album.pop and can be found on his album.  <br />
0156027321|4.0|Piscine Molitor Patel is a religious teenage boy who gets stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the pacific ocean,with a 450-pound bengal tiger, an orangutan,a zebra, and a hyena, after losing his family in a shipwreck. Soon the animals eat each other, and Pi is left with just the tiger. This story tells of Pi's survival. The first part of this book was mainly about Pi's background(his family, the zoo they owned, and how he came to practice 3 religions--Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam.) This part got kind of boring, but it had many important details. The second part is about the actaully shipwreck and his survival on the lifeboat for 227 days, and is more interesting. In the end Pi is interviewed by 2 Japenese investigators, and he gives them two stories of his survival. One story is with animals and the other has no animals but all humans. It's up to the reader to decide what story they believe in. Throughout the book, there are chapters that are told from Yann Martel's(the author) perspective. This makes Pi's story seem more realistic. In the beginning of this book a character says that this story will make you believe in God.That depends on the reader. Although this book really makes me think, it did NOT convince me, considering that this is a fictional novel.       overall: this is an interesting and witty story, that flows nicely, and reminds me of the movie CAST AWAY. I recommend this book to people who like books about animals, cast aways, or a nice summer read.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|This movie reminded me of the Abbot and Costello monster movies. Every monster, except for \\"The Invisible Man,\\" was in this movie just for the fun of it, just like the Abbot and Costello movies.  The movie had its good points. First, the movie had a lot of energy. Second, Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing was very good.  The special effects were good. The sets were terrific. I liked the Frankenstein monster. He was the only intelligent character in the movie.      On the minus side, Dracula was not very scary. The plot was very stupid, but then it wasn't directed toward adults, I suppose. Of course, my kids would have torn the movie apart for its internal inconsistencies. I grew up watching monster movies so I am more forgiving. The special effects tended to defy physics and logic at every conceivable opportunity. There was a lot of swinging from cables and ropes for impossible distances. The movie redefined the vampire legend without explaining why. For example, silver stakes were substituted for wooden stakes, I think. Vampires can sexually reproduce, somehow, I think. It wasn't really clear to me what was going on. There are some plot points that absolutely insulted my intelligence or the intelligence of the vampires.     Keep your expectations very low and the movie was okay. By all means, rent and not buy. I can't see any reason to see this movie twice.
0151001634|4.0|Wonderful journey of a mentally challenged person who goes through an experimental surgery that increases his brilliance. A classic in it's own right and a book which became a very well known movie also. <br />    It is a story of emotions and self discovery, the revealing of human nature and the masks we all wear. Charlie Gordon was a retarded person who is selected by scientists to undergo an experimental surgery to increase his intelligence. Algernon is a mouse who underwent the surgery before Charlie. After the surgery, Charlie comes to remember the memories from his childhood and begins to understand the motives of those whom he used to consider as friends. It was a sudden loss of innocence. Inspite of the monumental increase in his intelligence, his emotional maturity is not so. Charlie finds love in Alice, his former teacher and also make peace with his mother and younger sister. Meanwhile Algernon begins to deteriorate and Charlie realizes that his state is also temporary and starts to face his eventual decline back into a retarded stage. Algernon dies and Charlie recedes back to a much more retarded state of mind but having discovered himself and the people who loved and or hated him. <br />    Even if people laugh at you, it does not matter if you can laugh with them for there is hope that there might be love. There would be flowers for Algernon.
B00005QCVY|5.0|<br />For those of you visiting Earth for the first time and who have no idea what this film is about, here is a review: <br /> <br />\\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" begins in heaven, as angels discuss the sudden glut of prayers from the citizens of Bedford Falls, as they ask for help for George Bailey.   A man worthy of support from above, the angels decide to help George and dispatch Clarence, an angel in training, to do the job.     <br /> <br />The first ninety minutes of the film work as Clarence's (and the audience's) crash-course in George Bailey 101, as Clarence views the most important events in Bailey's life.  Clarence sees George as a little boy saving his brother's life and correcting potentially dangerous errors of his original employer, the town pharmacist.  As the young boy grows into an adult (Jimmy Stewart in the role for which he will most be remembered), George's life becomes one of compromise.  His dreams of seeing the world and a life of \\"importance\\" must be tempered and put on hold, as George settles for a job in his father's building and loan.   His friends and younger brother go off to exciting careers and fight in WWII, while George gets stuck in Bedford Falls and tries to convince the townsfolk to invest in each others' homes. <br /> <br />Clarence comes in to George's life just as he has decided his life is a failure.  Wishing he had never been born, Clarence grants that request and lets George see Bedford Falls as it would be without George Bailey.  What follows is a declaration as to the power of the individual, as George gets to see how much his life changed the world for the better.   <br /> <br />Singed into our culture and as regular a part of the Christmas season as long lines at Wal-Mart, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is the rare film that literally affects people's actions.  Almost everyone sees in George Bailey the humanity that we all can be and once dreamed of being.  The yearly viewing of this film reminds people of noble intentions they once had and the compromises we all make along the way.    I have no doubt that the night after this film is shown each year (usually the Saturday after Thanksgiving) people all across our country hit their pillows with goals and promises of doing better and doing more with their lives.   This little movie shows us all that we matter in the world, and that's a message we all need to hear from time to time.
B00008OE4W|5.0|i thought i would review this as not many women seem to have reviewed it thus far.  i have seen this film many, many times and i still thoroughly enjoy it.  to those who say it is stupid or they can't follow the plot........perhaps you just don't have the right mind for it.  it isn't fast-paced with explosions and james-bond helicopter chases and girls in bikinis.  what it does offer is an intellectually based, character driven plot.  this is not for the mtv-viewing sort.  as someone else noted, the score is amazing.  it really adds to the film as opposed to merely just being muzak.  i don't mean to sound snobby, but this film isn't for the sort that like films such as \\"2 fast, 2 furious\\" or \\"american pie\\".....ok, i have seen one of those films but found it really stupid.  also, though this film isn't a \\"chick-flick\\", i think it really appeals to both sexes.  i totally recommend this film.  see it!!
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Will Ferrell, one of the funnier of the recent Saturday Night Live cast members, stars as Buddy the Elf.  As a baby living in an orphanage, the baby buddy manages to crawl out of his crib and into Santa's bag of toys.  When Santa (Ed Asner) returns to the North Pole, the baby is found and they decide to raise him as an elf.  This north pole is straight out of a Rankin-Bass Animation with stop-motion snowmen and woodland creatures.<br /><br />Buddy is adopted by Papa Elf, played in his best deadpan style by Bob Newhart.  But all is not well, Buddy is twice the size of all the other elves and just doesn't excel at toy making.  He's finally told that he's human...he was put up for adoption and his father WAlter(james Caan) never knew he had a son.<br /><br />Walter is now a publishing Exec in NY and what's more..he's on the naughty list.  Buddy sets out...walking...all the way from the North Pole to NY to meet his dad.  Along the way he encounters a few adventures like getting a job as a Gimbels department store Elf, and getting into a fight with the fake Santa, and meeting a beautiful, but lonely girl, Jovie.<br /><br />Of course Walter at first thinks Buddy's nuts...but a blood test proves Buddy is his son and takes him home to his wife (Mary Steenburgen) and son Michael.<br /><br />As you would expect, Buddy eventually wins over his gruff father and imbues everyone around him with the true spirit of Christmas.<br /><br />The movie is very predictable but what Christmas movie isn't.  Ferrell is just so damn funny with his child-like portrayal of buddy, winning over everyone he meets...even the clerks in the mail room.  Ferrell really has great timing.<br /><br />All the roles are pretty standard, especially steenburgens who always seems to play the nice, sweet mother figure.  There are also some nice bit parts from Andy Richter and Artie Lange as the aforementioned fake Santa who gets into a fight with Buddy.<br /><br />The two disk DVD is loaded with a lot of extras including several cute little games you can play with your dvd remote.<br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot!a lot of extras including several cute little games you can play with your dvd remote. <br /> <br />I enjoyed it a lot! <br /> <br />
B000654YRY|1.0|I agree with the reviewer from Peterborough, not much here. 2.0 only mix. The same content as the original video released in the 1990s. On top of that no booket, no information on where the concert was recorded (it was actually from 2 locations if you have the CD of the same name). I was hoping for a few additional tracks. Only thing good was that the price was low enough!
B00068IOWM|4.0|I just wanna make myself clear. I am a great U2 fan, who hitchiked thru half East-Europe, was dying from cold, starving just to see them play in Prague... And there were only 2 songs for me on ATYCLB (Walk On, Kite), sorry... But I still remember that I've been listerning for it for a month or so hoping it would \\"grow\\". No. It didn't work out. I have a feeling that this will not happen with HTDAAB. Knock on woods though! Please be honest! I am sick and tired of all these shout \\"Aaah, U2 rocks!\\", \\"Best Album of 2004!\\" Bull! Stop it! <br /> <br />First of all if you are mad about ATYCLB - buy it immediately! You'll like it in its entirety. <br /> <br />For me there are definite parallels with ATYCLB, regrettably. Even chords sequences sometimes are JUST the same... But there are improvements! Unfortunately it took 4 years to develop them... And at the same time songs like Electrical Storm, and Hands That Built America we heard in between are very good. <br /> <br />People used to cheer for SYCMOYO... They said - it is the next One... Bull. It will never be One. Unfortunately. It is just that Stuck in the moment we almost forgot of:( Too personal. Too much pain. I don't like it. Ironically, the falcetto bridge Bono wrote in two minutes (thanks to DVD for that info - unfortunately DVD is overloaded with SYCMOYO and Vertigo:(() is the absolute highlite of that song. It is so funny that the \\"only song\\" they \\"wrote drinking\\" (DVD info) is the best song on CD which is Crumbs From Your Table. This one is fantastic. The song about love of man of age 30-40 to the young girl for me (quite an unusual understanding, I agree:))) <br /> <br />It is bad that band is going to promote weak songs from CD, but on the other hand it is understandable... I only wish they will include the best songs to the Live set like Miracle Drug (bravo!) and City of... (\\"You look so beautiful\\" - the worst, completely artificial part - they just had to make bridge I suppose and came up with it:((). The absence of Crumbs in Live Set in NY scared me... I hope it was just an occasion... <br /> <br />And something else... Please, understand that Bono does not write all the songs in which you hear words like \\"City\\" and (or) \\"die\\" etc. about 09/11. I really think that COBL does not refer to that tragedy. <br /> <br />The way U2 management put CD and DVD to the paper is dumbiest decision ever made. As well as not including lyrics to book (which is disaster). You could easily find space for lyrics in THAT book! Mine CD and DVD are all scratched because of the way they placed it... Very stupid. <br /> <br />Surprisingly enough I'd definitely reccommend to buy this Edition. We could argue if it worth that money, but remember, I paid almost same amount of money to this stuff just to be delivered to Russia nad I AM NOT dissapointed. I could only predict that you would not gonna be either.
B00028HBKC|5.0|The Passion of the Christ fulfills its purpose: to display the events described in the Gospels during the last hours of Jesus' earthly life.  It does so by combining eerie, surreal effects, such as Satan's appearances, with honest depictions of what the Gospels say he endured.  The historical accuracy, visual effects and overall atmosphere are beyond excellent.  This is truly a magnificent effort.    I am pleased to see that people of varying ideological stripes have seen and enjoyed this film.  As for the detractors, they seem to fall into two categories: (1.) incoherent ramblings from some who prove that atheists are not intellectually superior to Christians; and (2.) others who were \\"offended\\" by the violence.    As a mainstream Episcopalian who majored in biblical studies, I have seen no other movie on this subject that has so accurately conveyed the brutality of the Roman Empire or the cheapness with which life was regarded in the ancient world.  The graphic violence we find so distasteful was just another day in the Empire 2,000 years ago.  There is no \\"sin\\" in graphically communicating this truth to modern audiences.      One wonders if these detractors would be so critical of a film that portrayed another event, say, the tragic murder of Matthew Shepherd by homicidal monsters, in all its savagery.  It's likely they would hail the \\"courage\\" of the directors in doing so.  Sadly, their hypocrisy shows for all to see.     In the end I must applaud this film, and agree with Pope John Paul II, who said after seeing it \\"it is as it was.\\"  Amen.
0792163710|5.0|I first read Shane the book in High school and I too took a liking to Shane the character just like the boy Joe did in the book. In the opening of the movie we see Shane riding down into the Teton Valley and the majesty of those mountains is breathtaking. This movie was one of the most realistic and original westerns I have ever seen. With its mysterious yet appealing and friendly character portrayed to perfection by Alan Ladd. He is slow to anger, thinks before he acts and only uses violence as a very last resort. Anyone who has been at the receiving end of a bully's abuse can feel for Shane when he is ridiculed and harassed by Ryker and his men. Also, we feel for the boy Joey who probably has few friends living on a big ranch and whose father is busy working that ranch most of the time. Then Shane comes along and slowly, reluctantly gets involved with the problems that the homesteaders are having with the cattle rangers (Ryker). In that respect it is also a history lesson. We learn of the problems that went between these two ways of making a living in the west. The scenery of the Grand Tetons, which acts as a background to the Starrett family's homestead in the foreground, is totally realistic and absolutely gorgeous. In fact it WAS real, filmed almost completely on location. For the first time in a western we see a real western town with buildings only on one side of the street. Westerns always used buildings on both sides of the street sometimes to hide modern buildings in the distance. The attention to life like detail in this movie is extraordinary from the buildings to the clothes they wear. We see the characters walk through the mud in the street after a heavy rain. The true danger of guns is displayed when Shane teaches young Joe how to shoot. And we get both view points of gun control in a scene right after that. Interesting how these arguments in a movie from 1951 are still being made today over 50 later. If you don't like Westerns, which I generally don't, I think you'll like this one. An interesting change is when the first guy that ridiculed Shane and fought with changes sides and respects Shane. This is real life. I have had that happen many times where the person who ridiculed me at first and I thought was me enemy becomes my friend later on. And sometime those who were your friend at first turn against you later on. At the end of the movie, when the young Joe says to Shane, \\"We want you.\\", we feel the same way. We all want a hero like Shane not to leave and to be our friend and help us out now and then. In the end Shane rides off continuing in the same direction he was going in the beginning of the movie with young Joe calling out to him pleading with him to stay. We feel heart broken and tears swell up in our eyes as we feel the boy's loss, but as grown ups we somehow know that Shane must continue on to where he was going before.     The extra of this movie is exceptional. It is commentary during the entire length of the movie by the director's son who worked on the movie at age 17 and the assistant director. It is absolutly facinating. The picture quality is very good and the techincolor very well done.    This is a heart felt movie that extremely well done and is a must see for everyone.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I have only watched the DVD four times since I bought it last week. This is after watching it three times in the theater and reading the book twice, and listening to it once. So I am not a fan, at least not as much a fan as maybe two or three other people in the world! I am very interested in using this and the books to contrast the differences each art form makes on the audience. (Can you say \\"audience\\" for a book?) There are some basics. The advantage of the movie over the book: it takes hours less time go from start to finish. The impact of the visual stimuli coupled with the music is tremendously powerful. The disadvantage: same. The advantage of the DVD over the movie: you can watch it on your terms. Disadvantage? None depending on the equipment used. I have tried it on a small lap top, large PC screen, and HDTV projector. (Dogs bark and you have to let them out and so on, but is this a disadvantage?) There is an advantage to the soundtrack CD over the DVD: it takes even less time from start to finish. It sounds like the advantage goes with the less time it takes to enjoy JKR's imagination when a big concern -- the real issue for most of us, is how much time you can afford to spend in JKR's imaginary world when we don't really have time turners of our own. Question: apart from the pecuniary value in all of this, (how much wealth has been transferred here?) are there any costs associated with the use of words like \\"Muggle\\" or phrases like \\"Welcome to another year at Hogwarts!\\"? Has there been any thought to using these movies as part of the media blitz in the Middle East? What happened to Nearly Headless? Agreed: the explanation scene between Harry and Dumbledore is important. What happens if the movies get too movieish? Worst: no time line for HP6?<br /><br />In short, the books are wonderful, the movies are wonderful, the music is wonderful on its own, so all of these offerings are absorbing and entertaining, so if you have the time to be entertained why not be entertained by the best? But a serious question remains that posed by Neil Postman in his book \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\\" and Allan Bloom's \\"The Closing of the American Mind\\" both of which suggest the visual art form of movies (and TV especially) are harmful in the big picture. Pierre Bourdieu also riled against the media (\\"On Television\\") Which do you think is going to win over the minds and hearts of our children -- movies or books?

B0002XVSRE|5.0|I got the limited edition with the dvd and the book, and the cd comes with the 12th song 'fast cars'. So unless the versions are different, there is no reason to buy the japaneese import, unless you want it all.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Love the DVD quality and special features.  I would have liked to see more bloopers and deleted scences but there is enough in there to make it worth the purchase or rental.  I didn't care for the commentary track, seems like they didn't care as much about the show as the seinfans, just needed to lay down a commentary for the dvd attitude, still gets five stars because its the best sitcom ever and it's DVD quality!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne comes back after two years of working on her next album and she indeed makes a come back. Since the release of her debut album, \\"Let Go\\" in 2002, she has been known mainly for the three songs: \\"Complicated\\", \\"Sk8er Boi, and \\"I'm With You\\". While all three of the songs had good beats and wonderful lyrics, over time they become too repeptive. This returns with Avril in her next cd.<br /><br />1. Take Me Away: A good start to a cd but not exactly the best she could of done. True this song reflects what all teens go through at one point or another but she presents it with such a boring way. Overall, a 7.5/10.<br /><br />2. Together: Good message in this song and a nice set of lyrics. She gets her point across very clearly and sings from what I thought was one of her finer moments. 9/10<br /><br />3. Don't Tell Me: One of her best songs to date without a doubt. Getting the message across that it is noth worth getting involved with people who only want the sex, she sings it with clear notes and a wonderful tune. 10/10<br /><br />4. He Wasn't: This is where Avril made her mistake within the cd. This song was almost too much like her song \\"Sk8er Boi\\" with the tune. Though the message was good, this was too much like Sk8er Boi, so I have only listened to it fully once. 6/10<br /><br />5. How Does It Feel: Though I can understand the message she tries to get across in this song, it is very repetitve. The ballads are very consistant, as is the song itself. Not bad but defintley not her best. 5/10<br /><br />6. My Happy Ending: This I feel is Avril's best song on the whole track. She obviously puts all her energy into singing this song and the melody is absolutley perfect for her message. Being dragged along, thinking nothing is wrong and then only to be left by the person you love. The utter confusion strikes you and it is not only until later the reason why hit you. Awesome song! 10/10<br /><br />7. Nobody's Home: Avril takes the quiet and sad side in this song that she showed with \\"I'm With You\\". I love how she sings it but the lyrics could of been better. 7/10<br /><br />8. Forgotten: I could not help but feel the touch of Amy Lee influence at the beginning of the song with the ah's. Haunting melody, Avril takes a darker approach with her lyrics in this song and it pays off. Good song overall. 8.5/10<br /><br />9. Who Knows: Another message that is repeptive with her earlier songs. I honestly did not see any new things in this one. 5/10<br /><br />10. Fall To Pieces: Another great song by Avril! She puts just as much energy and soul into this song as she sings the lyrics. You can honestly tell when she really tries to sing and when she doesn't. The melody follows her voice very well and supports the lyrics perfectly. Very good message!! 10/10<br /><br />11. Freak Out: Avril does very good in singing in this fast pace and optimistic song. The melody is very catchy and the songs will definetley get you bobing your head at least a little. 9/10<br /><br />12. Slipped Away: Again, Avril could of ended her cd better. Though she song gets her message across very well, she could of sang much better and choosen a better melody too it. 7/10<br /><br />All in all, Avril comes back with a bang, showing that she is still going strong. Whether you like Avril Lavigne or not, she will continue singing and I wish her the best of luck. Can't wait to see your next cd!!in this song that she showed with \\"I'm With You\\". I love how she sings it but the lyrics could of been better. 7/10 <br /> <br />8. Forgotten: I could not help but feel the touch of Amy Lee influence at the beginning of the song with the ah's.

B0002OXVDW|5.0|I am a huge MGM musical fan, and I loved all three of the THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! films, especially the first and third. This boxed set restores the films to their original splendor and although I have am HDTV, they offer a full frame version (with letterbox parts) for those who still have square TVs. <br /> <br />The sound is amazing..The extras are astounding. you get a whole extra disc of them with like 6 hours of goodies, including a boatload of outtake numbers you've never seen before. <br /> <br />The icing on the cake is the classy Turner Classic channel host Robert Osborne to give nifty introductions. <br /> <br />What a superb DVD set. A MUST-BUY!!!!!
B0006213WG|5.0|that Sum 41 had it in them to come up with such a deep album? I'm very impressed at the introspective lyrics and how different this is than the pop-crap they'd put out previously. I didn't like Sum 41 until I bought this album....seems like they found themselves here....
B00067BBQE|5.0|First off, I mainly listen to metal bands from Europe or Eurometal if you will.  Evanescence is a huge breath of fresh air to come out of the states!  Secondly, I believe if you're new to the band, then Anywhere But Home is a fine place to start.  Evanescence prove they can serve up live as well as in the studio!  They perform in front of a huge crowd in Paris, France that seems to know every word to every song.  In addition, Amy Lee has won my respect as a person and as a band leader!  She conducts herself with class, but still rocks out the same, while expressing her gratitude toward her fans!  Lastly, Anywhere But Home won't disappoint fans of Evanescence, but most likely will build your respect for already a great band!  If you like Evanescence, then I suggest trying out Nightwish and Within Temptation.  Both of the following bands are available at Amazon.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I am so glad Shania put out a cd with her greatest hits.. it's great, cause all the songs on there are amazing. you don't have to keep swaping cds to listen to song on the other disc. cause you get alot of them all on one. and all of them are awesome. Shania has new tracks on there and m y favorite is don't it's an amazing song and so pretty. i couldn't see anyone else singing a song like that. shania is always coming up with great new songs. even fun songs like I ain't no quitier that is a hot song. shania has proved her self more them once. she does it all the time an album is released and she did it once again with her greatest hits. i wonder what she has up her sleeve for her next cd..
B00006BIO0|4.0|Entire review deleted and retracted.<br /><br />Once you hear the Patton sides on [[ASIN:B000001Z3Z American Primitive, Vol. 1: Raw Pre-War Gospel (1926-36)]] or the whole [[ASIN:B00005QD75 Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues: The Worlds of Charley Patton]] you'll never listen to this JSP Charley Patton box again.<br /><br />The sound on this one is small, tight and flat in comparison. The sound on those others BREATHES. It's not at all a question of which has more static or more popping. There is more noise on American Primitive and Screamin' & Hollerin' but the sound is so much more open. The music is alive on those in a way it's never close to on this JSP.
B0002Z1EG2|1.0|An amazing collection of Shanis Hits.  I would have bought it even if it content no new tracks.  I wonder how they decided with tracks to include, in my book every Shania song is a Greatest Hit.  Shania just keeps on given.
1573225517|5.0|I read Nick Hornby's High Fidelity almost six years ago.  It remains one of my favorite books to this day.  The insight into the male mind in this book is frightening at times and hilarious with every turn of the page.  The book eventually spawned a movie by John Cusack that was only average compared to the source material.<br /><br />Hornby's book takes place in England and the music tastes and lists definitely have an English bent, but the story is ultimately about relationships.  The book is a quick read; it only took a couple of casual days reading to get through.  I would recommend this book to anyone that is an intense music fan or anyone that reorganizes their music collection ever six months.
B0002Y69NG|1.0|This is a disgrace to the original Matrix movie.  The original movie was, and still is, one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The sequels had the potential to be the greatest sci-fi trilogy in history, and they failed miserably. <br /> <br />The Wachowski brothers planned the sequels from the begining?  B.S., then why did the 2 sequels have absolutely nothing to do with the first movie and were completely about doing cool special effects.   <br /> <br />The best slap in the face to both movies is that neither were nominated for a single academy award. <br /> <br />But hey, if you want a $60 set of 10 coasters, be my guest!
6302891272|2.0|I think the typically Japanese setting helped in creating suspense, it also made the killing of the king have a greater impact because treason was highly unlikely in Japan. The forest also provided a good setting for the meeting of the witch/evil spirit, because the density and humidity in the forest made it earier. <br /> <br />The plot changes by Kurosawa made it difficult to follow the connection between Macbeth and the Throne of Blood due to the fact that Kurosawa left out many important scenes, such as the sighting of the dagger in the air by Macbeth, and in place had extended scenes of MIfune and a co-actor riding around pointlessly throught the forest. Kurosawa also changed the plot so that Mifune was killed by his own men instead of by the opposing force. One adaptation that was fitting and had a good effect was the changing of the three witches to one evil spirit, this was a good choice because Japanese culture doesn't speak much of witches but more of evil spirits. <br /> <br />I think Toshiro Mifune's portrayal of Macbeth coulld have been better, for the fact that he did not portray the internal struggles that Macbeth had in the early part of the play. He also did not have the air of almost psychotic arrogance that Macbeth had, when his forces start abandoning him Mifune tries to stop them, where as Macbeth said that he did not need his troops. Isuzu Yamada's portrayal of Lady Macbeth was also relatively poor, although she still convinced \\"Macbeth\\" to kill the king she was not as forceful and commanding as Lady Macbeth, she was also too timid and did not reprimand Macbeth as Lady MAcbeth did. <br /> <br />Kurosawa could have also used slightly more violence to get the full impact of the story across, and to show how truly evil the killing of the king was. With regard to the end of the movie it would have been more effective  to have the two armies go into battle and then have Mifune's troops abandon him in the middle of Battle and have the king of the opposing force and Mifune have a duel.
B00005JLF5|4.0|The first season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was a very interesting beginning. We discovered in the first episode that we would be staying in one place, exploring a little but dealing much more with the Bajoran people and how they are recovering from years of occupation, along with their grooming to be new members of the United Federation of Planets. Past Trek shows have been on a ship, but this show would take place on a space station. One thing this means is that they can't run away from their problems. If something comes up, they have to deal with it, and the consequences of the problem could very well come back and haunt the crew later on. Recurring characters (Garak and Dukat are introduced in the first season, along with Keiko O'Brien coming over from Next Generation) abound, and relationships are allowed to grow and change. These characters are not static like the Next Generation characters generally were. I can't see much of a difference between William Riker in season 1 and William Riker in season 7 of Next Generation. Kira Nerys, on the other hand, has changed greatly just within season 1 of Deep Space Nine<br /><br />I was really glad when all seven seasons came out in DVD boxed sets. The presentation is wonderful, with four episodes per disc (except the first one, which includes the 2-hour premiere). The menus are great, with the Deep Space Nine theme projecting majestically from the speakers. It's always been my favourite of all the themes anyway. After you choose an episode, you then can either play it, press \\"set up\\" (where you set up your audio and subtitle options), \\"chapter log\\" (where you can go to any scene), or return to the main menu.<br /><br />There are six discs in the set, with the first five containing the episodes and then the sixth being a bunch of specials. There is a documentary on the first season, called \\"A Bold Beginning.\\" There's a crew dossier on Kira Nerys, the secrets of Quark's bar, a sketchbook of production sketches and a little bit about alien props. There are also a bunch of easter eggs on this disc, with other crew dossiers and little interesting tidbits about the actors and their roles. We hear about how they got their part and what their feelings are about their characters. Some of the interviews are from the first season, when the actors didn't know where their characters were going. Others are from after the show, or during the last season. They're par for the course for actors' interviews, so if you're naturally bored by them, you won't find much of interest here. If you like the show, though, they're intriguing.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful collection of episodes. The picture quality is wonderful, with the exception of one episode, but I'm sure that's just on my edition. \\"The Storyteller\\" made my DVD player have conniptions, and I had already had so much hassle with Columbia House that I wasn't going to try and deal with them to get a better copy. It's just one episode, though. The packaging is interesting and sturdy, with two fold-out covers revealing the plastic disc trays. The overall quality of these discs is quite high. Only the quality of some of the episodes themselves brings the rating of the boxed set down to 4 stars. They had a rough patch in the middle of the season.<br /><br />As for the episodes themselves, they are like many first seasons of shows gone by, with some standout episodes, some strong ones with weaknesses, and quite a few misses as they try to find their legs.  The best two actually end the season, as \\"Duet\\" (the story of a Cardassian war criminal coming back to Bajor which is not necessarily what it appears) and \\"In the Hands of the Prophets\\" (dealing with the mixture of religion and schools, but also showcasing just how far Federation/Bajor relations have come, and how far they have to go).  There are definitely some strong ones near the beginning, too, but there is a string of misses in the middle of the season that just makes you wonder.  If it hadn't been for the strong opening, I may have really despaired.<br /><br />This is a wonderful beginning to the Deep Space Nine odyssey, in my opinion the best Trek series out there.<br /><br />David Royakes you wonder.  If it hadn't been for the strong opening, I may have really despaired. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful beginning to the Deep Space Nine odyssey, in my opinion the best Trek series out there. <br /> <br />David Roy
B000005RTG|4.0|This is probably one of my biggest breaks from popular opinion. Machine Head is their best work in my opinion, and most critics would agree. But I'd consider this album a reasonably close second, while most people would put it near the bottom of the list. They'd lost Roger Glover on bass and Ian Gillian on vocals a few albums back, and finally had to replace Richie Blackmore on guitar, possibly their most defining personnel change.  With most of the group now gone, they made this one last album before they broke up, not to return until their ill-conceived '80s comeback. They still had Jon Lord, perhaps the greatest metal keyboardist ever, they got Tommy Bolin to fill in on guitar and really experimented. The results are absolutely phenomenal. Every track burns from beginning to end with the ferocity of a dying organism and the unfettered creativity of a group of people with nothing to prove. Although I hate to single any part out, perhaps the defining moment is a two movement piece at the end that starts off as a vocal ballad with all the instrumental parts played on multi-track by Jon Lord and then transitions seamlessly into one of the most smoking instrumentals I've ever heard, featuring the whole band. And yes, the album's a little cheesy. But it's so fervently cheesy that you can't help liking it. I've had this album for nearly two decades, and I every time I'm not listening to it I think that it can't possibly be as good as I remember. But then I put it on and it's even better. It never disappoints.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|There's at least a little bit of style in \\"Underworld\\".  Star Kate Beckinsale looks very stylish in various tight shiny black outfits and if you had to choose between her Selene or Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity - I find Selene a more interesting character.<br /><br />There's a LOT that goes unexplained in this movie.  It takes as a given that you understand a little bit of monster lore - sunlight is deadly to vampires, silver just as deadly to werewolves and both of them can transmit their condition from a bite.  Beyond that it stumbles pretty badly into some new monster mumbo-jumbo.  It seems there are some humans who carry the strain of a virus which make it possible to withstand the bites of both where previously the bite of a vampire would kill someone previously bitten by a werewolf.  There are also some \\"super-Vampires\\" called \\"The Elders\\".  There are three elders, but two are always required to be in hibernation while one gets to be awakened for reasons that are never explained.<br /><br />The film opens with an extended action sequence and other than a brief prologue voiceover that tells you that the war between vampires and lycans has gone on for over a thousand years, you don't know anything about the characters, so the extended fight in a subway feels more impersonal than a video game.<br /><br />The final act involves one \\"surprise\\" after another.  Hidden secrets and treacherous alliances that seem to have been going on for centuries are all revealed over about 2 or 3 days - the keepers of the secrets suddenly become less good at keeping them once the cameras started rolling.<br /><br />I could reveal more about the plot, but that would cut seriously into your enjoyment should you decide to watch \\"Underworld\\". The movie looks pretty good and the story, while basically a Vampire-Werewolf soap opera, at least goes somewhere.
B00009Z576|5.0|This album is a major split between my opinion and that of the public. Many would consider this to be their most embarassing moment, but it's got a solid place in my personal top three Yes albums, and I may even be able to make an argument for #1. See, there's some good things about Yes and some bad things, and most of the bad things have to do with being one of the most pretentious bands in the history of music. The fountainhead of their pretense is the singer, Jon Anderson. A cheesier human would be hard to find. In the late '70s he left the band and took keyboard player Rick Wakeman with him. Jon returned in the early '80s as soon as he got wind of the fact that Trevor Rabin was going to make the band relevant again, but for one album in their entire history he let them be. Meantime they teamed up with The Buggles, which happened to be a band composed only of a singer and a keyboard player. Trevor Horn, the singer, wasn't very good at singing (although he went on to be one of the most sought-after producers in the biz), but keyboardist Geoff Downes was perfect, nearly technically as good as Wakeman, but with a fresher and more viscerally driving sound. Bassist Chris Squire has never had a better venue to show off his impressive chops than this album. And the fusion of The Buggles' experimental new wave quirkiness with the prog-mastery of Yes resulted in a musical palate I can't even categorize. I can't think of another album that sounds like Drama. Stunningly brilliant, unique and compelling from beginning to end, I can't fathom why it's considered a failure. I never tire of it.
B0000027RL|5.0|this cd helped define the 1990's.  songs like Porch, Jeremy, and Black will forever be remembered for giving music a new direction.  This is a cd that you purchase several times because you wear it out.
B000002KDX|5.0|Wow, what an album.  I've owned this for about 15 years now, on vinyl, tape and CD, and I never tire of it.  One of those desert island discs.  It's a lot like Crosby, Stills and Nash, but infinitely more interesting because of the way the vocal harmonies are augmented by fascinating, complex acoustic instrumental harmonies and counterpoint.  With the possible exception of \\"I Need You\\", every song on here is perfect, varied enough to keep interest, but still providing a cohesive atmosphere.  Aside from the popular \\"Horse With No Name\\", \\"Donkey Jaw\\" and \\"Three Roses\\" stand out as masterpieces.  But there is hardly a weak track among the album. <br /> <br />One word of caution, though... this is the best album they ever did.  They got cheesy and poppy soon after this was released and never made anything nearly as good.  So get this album, love it, and consider it a \\"best of America\\" collection rather than facing the inevitable disappointment that their other inferior albums will bring.

6305291446|5.0|It was great to see Jaime Lee Curtis back in full force again.  Michael Myers is back with 2 things on his mind, killing his sister Laurie and killing everyone that gets in his path.  Laurie has many flashbacks of her brother in the beginning of the film until, she is face to face with him in a window of a door.  Josh Hartnett plays Laurie's son John and does a pretty good job as a newcomer to the big screen.  This movie I thought was a very good one and tries to stick with the original formula of the first one.  However, very inferior to the one that started it all.  IMO, absolutely no horror movie will ever surpass Halloween, period!  If you are new to the Halloween series I would STRONGLY suggest watching the first and second ones before this.  If you are a fan of the series it's a no brainer, if you are like me, you've owned this movie for some time now.
0393316041|4.0|The novel, \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\", by Richard Feynman was very interesting I must say. The numerous stories of events during his life were very comical and entertaining. Feynman's humorous tales of his ideas and experiences made it hard to put down. Although the book is written by a physicist, it is not your typical science book. It tells about the things Mr. Feynman did from his childhood all the way up to his life as an adult. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an enjoyable biography about a wonderfully successful physicist.
B000002V1D|4.0|It's always funny to read the mainstream reviews for your favorite artists, and how they make not so ancient hits (Big Thing) sound like they happened decades ago. After a short hiatus, the boys returned to the airwaves with yet more proof that they had some staying power.<br /><br />Just before the album was released, the band performed 'Orindary World' live on NBC's The Today Show, and I was enthralled. After the ho-hum of the single 'Too Much Information', I was blown away by this song's simplicity, and its depth. And the follow up 'Come Undone' was equally beautiful and powerful. So I went out and purchased the album.<br /><br />Half of the album I flat out don't like - songs like 'Shotgun' and 'Femme Fatale' are just filler, and others are just mainstream pop blather, lacking in real creativity and interest. But then there are songs like 'Love Voodoo' with its pervasive bass and catchy hooks, and the penultimate power track, 'Sin of the City', which, when clustered along side the singles, make this album a must-have for fans of Duran Duran.<br /><br />Is it as good as previous DD albums? No. And I don't think it's as good as their newest offering, Astronaut. But its an excellent album nonetheless.
0140366954|5.0|Louisa May Alcott captured the spirit of a loving family in \\"Little Women,\\" the ultimate coming-of-age story. In \\"Good Wives,\\" the second half of the \\"Little Women\\" story (and the second part of an ongoing family saga), Alcott takes her little women out of teenage hijinks and into a darker, more adult place.<br /><br />The book opens with Meg March's wedding to John Brooke -- he's not the wealthy man of her dreams, but he is the man she loves. As Meg learns that it's a struggle to be a poor man's wife, her sisters Jo and Amy are stretching their own wings -- Amy is becoming an accomplished young artist, and Jo is letting \\"genius burn\\" as a published writer. Beth, who has never recovered from her bout of scarlet fever, is still a fragile homebody.<br /><br />Things take an unexpected turn when Aunt March invites Amy to go to Europe with her -- a trip Jo has wanted for years. To make things worse, Beth is in love with Laurie... but then Laurie proposes to Jo. When she rejects him, he storms away to Europe. Jo leaves as well, to be a governess and a writer in the city, but returns home to find Beth slowly wilting away. Tragedy, love and new life will bring the family back together in unexpected ways.<br /><br />It always hurts to grow up, and the events of \\"Good Wives\\" are no exception. It's a much more adult book than the first \\"Little Women,\\" with the girls finding out about love, marriage, careers, artistic attempts and the loss of loved ones. There's plenty of humor -- Jo's disastrous housecalls and Amy's equally disastrous dinner party -- but it's muted.<br /><br />Alcott's  writing, surprisingly, doesn't change much -- it's still funny, weird and highly detailed, but also full of sweetness and pathos. And while the book has some sad endings, the overall feel is that life goes on and things always turn out, if not happily, then for the best -- there are marriages, babies, and new beginnings for everyone. And it ends with a lead-in to the sequel, \\"Little Men,\\" with Jo and Professor Bhaer adopting a bunch of boys as unruly as Jo was.<br /><br />Jo is the same old Jo, with her foot in her mouth and her fierce independence. But she does become more mature and less prickly. Beth is almost a nonentity, wasting away until leaving the book altogether; Meg seems rather ditzy as a housewife, but apparently is shown as a Marmee-in-training. Amy does the best of all, becoming a vivid, funny character almost as likable as Jo.<br /><br />The second part of \\"Little Women\\" is \\"Good Wives\\" -- a very different kind of story about the March girls. But if anything, it's a more beautiful and sweeter one.Jo and Professor Bhaer adopting a bunch of boys as unruly as Jo was.<br /><br />Jo is the same old Jo, with her foot in her mouth and her fierce independence.

B00005JMJG|4.0|After watching a dozen European and Asian films, films like: In The Mood for Love and Love and Lucida, I was ready for good old American filmmaking.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind isn't overly technical with color and technical innovation, but it does have the greatest screenplay writer in the world, the great Charlie Kaufman.  Here is a writer as legendary as any actor or director. Look him up on Goggle and you'll see his amazing story. <br /> <br />Jim Carey (Joel) is a likable slump and Kate Winslet (Clementine) is the pretty but troubled wild girl.  They meet, they love, they screw up, they hate each other, and they break up.  Then Tom Wilkinson, the brain doctor, erases their memory of each other.  We suspend belief because the script goes a little science fiction with the medical procedure that erases bad memories, humiliations, foolish fears, or any other unpleasantness of a lifetime.  During the procedure Joel changes his mind and he rebuilds his psyche in order to retrieve the magic in love. <br /> <br />There is a secondary story.  Kirsten Dunst is playing her first adult role, a doctors' receptionist.  Her memory is erased also, so that she doesn't wreck Wilkerson's marriage.  Hmm, I see this is getting difficult to explain.  Know that this film had a decent emotional punch.  Loving another person is very difficult over a long period.  Not everyone gets the hang of it.  After all, it takes two to tango.  Paraphrasing the philosopher, Nietche:  Lucky is the human who remembers none of his or her blunders.  They are the happiest of them all.  Freud would have more to say, but I digress. <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|Although this album isn't quite the rock 'n roll blowout that it seems some people were expecting, it is so articulate and well-crafted that any U2 fan will appreciate it.  It's definitely more suited to an adult crowd than teenagers, so I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't fare as well as some other recent releases.  But don't miss out on this simply because it might not be #1 on the charts.  Bono's ability to communicate emotional experiences so universally is amazing, and the Edge's ability to reflect that with a guitar is unique to this band.  Although \\"One Step Closer to Knowing\\" and \\"YAHWEH\\" seem a little unpolished and hastily done, the rest of the songs more than compensate.  If you don't buy the album, be sure to download \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\" and \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\".  Certainly not the best U2 record, but definitely one of the best records of the year.
B00063EMJG|5.0|The only reason that I am writeing this review is to correct a couple of mistakes in a couple of other reviews. One of the other reviewers mentioned that this is available as an SACD. This is not true, Neil Young does not support the SACD format. Another reviewer mentioned that the DVD only has a Dolby Digital track of the music. This is not true. The DVD disc has a very high resolution 24 bit 96 khz version of the music. This super high resolution version of the music is far superior to any HDCD version simply because HDCD is a 16 bit 44.1 khz soundtrack. This set is worth getting simply for the super high resolution of the music. Most DVD-Audio discs cost $20 by themselfs and here you are able to get one for just a couple of dollars. Buy this set, you will love it.
B000023VR6|5.0|Well what can i say that hasn't been said already. This is possibly the best production on an album ever. Dre absolutely destroys any other producers and rappers hopes of being called good coz he deserves the title now as master producer. This album is slick from start to finish, as expected when you have tunes like STILL DRE, FORGOT ABOUT DRE, NEXT EPISODE, THE WATCHER, F*@K YOU and BANG BANG. These are the best in my opinion with a beat thats so wicked that only Dre and accomplice Mel-Man are capable of. The guest list is also impressive with too many rappers to mention. It's one of those c.d's that never get's boring or repetetive. All in all if anybody thinks they are a rap fan well they aren't if they don't have this c.d. In one word it's UNBELIEVABLE. Buy it now people.

Beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep, Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets, Beef is when I see you, Guaranteed to be an ICU, one more time, What's beef? Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep, Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep <br />Beef is when I see you, Guaranteed to be an ICU, check it. <br /> <br />Genius, absolute genius.  <br /> <br />People will say Tupac is the greatest. But I guess thats coz his subject matter was quite versatile and most people could relate to his conscious self, (and also he put out more material than your average rapper or any singer for that matter). But take away his hit tracks like Dear Mama, Brenda's got a baby, Hit Them Up, etc and all you will have is an average M.C. <br /> <br />Biggie was something else. Truly, out of this world.  <br /> <br />You could strip down Ready To Die to just 5 songs and it would still be a classic. You could strip down Life After Death to just 8 songs and again it would be a classic.  <br /> <br />When Tupac died we all felt the loss. But it wasnt much of a void, considering his material still comes out every year. If Tupac was the greatest, then how come the game aint the same still, I mean since there is new music from him coming out still. It dont make sense. Has he got any real impact on today's rap industry. I'm not saying Tupac is not really missed - I just feel that its Biggie's death rather that created this void that has unstabilised the industry. I know Eminem's fans wont like me for saying this but I certainly believe that Eminem woulndt have co-existed along Biggie. He just wouldnt have been accepted into the game. Its not just Eminem - its artists like Nelly, Chingy, J-Kwon, etc, all those Disney Channel rappers. No one could have paid them any attention if Biggie and Tupac were still alive.  <br /> <br />Whoever shot Biggie is an idiot.Did he not realise what he was doing? <br /> <br />We miss you B.I.G. We'll always love you. Rest In Peace, playboy. <br />
068987474X|2.0|This book was so depressing, I couldn't even finish reading it and I'm sorry I read as much as I did.  I was depressed for a week after reading it.  This book oversimplifies the very complex world of dating and male/female relationships.  Basically it tells you in a dozen chapters what could be said in one page.  This book focuses on alot of the bad things guys do but it gives little hope or advice on where to find a good man who will treat you with respect.
B0002XDODU|3.0|I absolutely loved the Mutter, Sehnsucht, and Herzelheid albums. Unfortunately, this album fails to deliver in the ways that those albums do.  It is decent music, but it sounds like Rammstein has gone soft.  (Mein Teil, Reise Reise, and Amerika are exceptions).   Reise means travel or perhaps vacation in German.  Hopefully, Rammstein is just taking a vacation from their earlier musical style.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|The moment I first heard of this album I realized I simply must own it. <br /> <br />How often in your life are you going to find a greatest hits album that encompasses the high points of an artist like Neil Young's whole career? The man has a library of something like 600 songs. <br /> <br />Not only that, but they're not just Neil's solo work. You also have some Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and some Crazy Horse thrown in for good measure! How many artists incorperate their work with other bands in their own greatest hits album? I'll tell you: Only one that I know of, and that's Neil Young. <br /> <br />If you like classic rock, you'll like this album. If you like punk rock, you'll like this album. If you like hard rock, you'll like this album (Cinnamon Girl: one of the best head-banging songs every commited to tape). If you like country (the good stuff, rather than the commercial fluffery) you'll like this album. If you like Seatle rock, you'll like this album. If you like great guitar work, great accoustic guitar, meaningful lyrics, interesting vocals, or just really good music, YOU WILL LIKE THIS ALBUM. <br /> <br />And of course, if you're a Neil Young fan and have seen him repeatedly in concert and got excited each time because you were in the same room with him and breathing the same air as one of the greatest musicians ever to put the breath of life into rock and a guitar... you'll faint the first time you hold it in your hands, because you'll think you've died and gone to heaven. <br /> <br />AND it makes a great gift!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the best shows tv has ever had.  How the network could have canceled it I do not understand.  I recomend this. I found this web site that has information on the movie, looking forward to Sept.30th 2005 release. <br /> <br />[...]
B0000AQVCL|1.0|don't get me wrong...i love classic rock music.  i love tasteful guitar playing along with simple, catchy, riffy songs which is why my tastes range from the white stripes to slayer.  i don't think that high-speed shredding is the end-all, be-all form of guitar music.  \\"satisfaction\\" \\"that'll be the day\\" and \\"smells like teen spirit\\" all had one in common in that they're simple, catchy, and had staying power.  but, alas, this record has none of that. this is the most boring, contrived, lethargy-inducing pile of crap i've heard in years.  rock music has been screwy recently, anyway.  you either get lame, overemotional and not to mention pretentious drivel (thursday, dashboard confessional, taking back sunday, any other countless terrible emo/screamo/hardcore/indie/whatever bands poised to break into the mainstream in the coming days/weeks/months) or so-called \\"saviors of rock\\" who are only good at copping whole riffs from other bands (the hives, the vines, JET for sure) with an occasional diamond in the rough such as the white stripes who obviously have the type of burning passion for their art that causes a band to make truly touching and superior music.   <br /> <br />but moving on, this album spans everything from 4-minute dumb-as-dirt, dime-a-dozen, radio-ready, paint-by-numbers, uninspired verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-major pentatonic solo-chorus-yay-we're-done-lets-hit-the-strip-club! rock songs to the mandatory \\"sensitive\\" balladry that could only make an already bad album worse. <br /> <br />the fact that these jokers actually made it out of australia, let alone get heavy airplay in the states gives me so much hope for my own musical career i want to pack it up and head out to LA tomorrow.  people who are ten times better and have tried ten times harder to get into the position they basically walked into will have a legacy, JET won't.
0140277447|1.0|and the world is now in the midst of turmoil and crisis. In order to keep the scarcely maintained world peace, the role of the continued Japan-U.S. friendship and alliance is unshakable. Throughout the Cold War era and up to the present day, there has been some serious friction recorded, especially in the area of trade relative to the export of textiles and steel, also in the area of discussions as to increasing Japan's defense capabilities, and to restructuring of Japan's economic system. However, these items of discussion have been, without exception, items of national interest. Both nations, Japan and U.S., have tried to mutually resolve the problems and to reach the satisfactory resolutions and these efforts and achievements are universally recognized. <br /> <br />However, for the past few years, some peculiar anti-Japanese campaigns have been started in the U.S., and they have been escalated as the time passed. We are deeply concerned that the new serious friction between Japan and the U.S. has expanded as a result of these campaigns. The reason we express our concerns is that these anti-Japanese activities have been developed in the U.S., but aren't related directly to the national interests of either country. It is our assertion that there is someone of the third world trying to set them up from behind. <br /> <br />Specifically, Chinese-American Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking, which was published in July 1997 in the U.S., and the wave of anti-Japanese campaigns agitated by her claims are sitting at the center of this problem. The book's contents do not present verified facts, and furthermore, they represent the quite opposite. As a result, those Japanese who are shocked with such an injustice are not few. For this twisted representation of the historical facts of the 'Nanking Massacre', even a monthly Japanese magazine, called Sekai which has been a representative of the group which has admitted the 'Nanking Massacre', can't have helped but express its disagreement and published an unusual explanatory statement. <br />

B0006399FS|5.0|I only heard a short clip of Vertigo prior to buying this. When I came here to make the buy, thought I would see what some of the other citizens thought of it. As I read the reviews, a few idle thoughts came to mind, not listed in any order of importance:  <br /> <br />Several people expressed dismay that the sound of U2 has changed. There was disappointment that the Edge may not still have that \\"edge\\" that separated him from so many other second fiddles that stood directly behind many group's headliners. There was an abundance of lamenting concerning Bono not possessing that \\"Bono Vox\\" he has given the world for the almost thirty plus years.  <br /> <br />After reading the reviews and listening to this, I found that it is a work that is exactly where it should be. It sounds like U2 should sound today. It is reflective of an incredible musical career that is beginning to span two generations. And it is the sound and contains the energy and drive that makes U2 what it was....what it is today, and what it will be remembered as.  <br /> <br />I did not buy this hoping it would sound like \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\". I already own \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" and am very content and satisfied with the way it sounds. I bought this with a reasonable expectation that I would hear a musical group in the autumn of their career still putting out some of the best, most original and undoubtedly most creative musical work on the planet. And I was not disappointed....I don't think you will be either.  <br /> <br />
B000089CJI|5.0|I listened to Postal Service's album after hearing one of their songs in the film Garden State.  After listing to it, I have to rank it among the top albums that I've ever heard.  While they have a truly unique sound, fans of all walks of music, from pop to techno, from electronic to alternative will appricialte the original sound and heartfelt lyrics which make up this album.  Would make a good stocking stuffer for that audiophile on your holiday list!
B0006399FS|5.0|The early release of the lead-off single \\"Vertigo\\" created an expectation in my mind that this would be a hard-rocking album of sizzling guitars and powerful vocals. What comes after that rip-roaring song is a carefully crafted, mature U2 album that is prettier and more open than expected. I think \\"Vertigo\\" created such a strong impression that it took me 2-3 listens before I could appreciate this album for what it is. And it's great! Thanks, U2, for another album worth waiting for.

B00005K9LM|4.0|This album came out a couple years before heavy metal started to become more about hair and posing than music. 1984 was a great year for metal music with Metallica, Riot, Accept, and Judas Priest all putting out great albums. I think this is the last of the great Priest albums but I know many people like Painkiller. Defenders Of The Faith has one of my all-time favorite Priest songs, The Sentinal! Rob's vocals are simply awesome and the riffs rule! Other standout tracks are Some Heads Are Gonna Roll (the hit off the album), Love Bites (great lyrics and cool chorus), and the rocking Jawbreaker. I would give this album 5 stars but the production could have been a little better and I don't care for Heavy Duty (sludge metal) or Eat Me Alive (tolerable). But the rest of the album is classic Priest! I also recommend Screaming For Vengeance, Killing Machine, and Sad Wings Of Destiny!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Very rarely do we hear songs that can bring inspiration to our lives. Stripped, by Christina Aguilera, consists of both the typical pop music that so many teens love and the extra added inspiration that the teenage population, mainly females, need. <br /> <br />Her album promotes people to be their true selves and also takes a stand for females. This album does not attack men, but takes on a more pro female point of view. <br /> <br />In track number three, she rebels against the advantages men have over women in a society filled with \\"double standards\\". She takes a step forward and explains how girls can do whatever they feel is right and not worry about what the men have to say about them. In addition to the moving lyrics, the beat of the music keeps the listeners bouncing their heads, tapping their fingers and moving their bodies. <br /> <br />Besides bringing females a sense of mental empowerment, her lyrics and vocal ability also have the power to console those who lack confidence in themselves. Her voice, when she sings, reassures the listener that her words are truthful and not just another meaningless song being sung. <br /> <br />Christina Aguilera's newest album, Stripped, is by far one of the bests pop albums being sold. A lot about life can be learned when listening to her CD. The lyrics in the CD are so compelling and powerful that her target audience can get a sense of exactly how personal this album is. Along with Christina's powerful lyrics to inspire, her vocal ability is off the charts. This is the perfect album to listen to when you are in any mood, especially when a sense of inspiration is needed.
B000001F7R|4.0|This first full length studio album from Def Leppard is quite good considering they were all in their late teens when they started recording it (drummer Rick Allen was only 17!) The songwriting here hinted at what was to come from these Sheffield lads. My favorite tracks are Rock Brigade, Satellite, Wasted, Rocks Off, It Don't Matter, and Overture. I would give this album 5 stars if it weren't for the poor production. This is one album that I would love to see re-recorded. The two albums that followed this are classics so get all three!
1400082773|5.0|This book went by in three days! Couldn't put it down! <br /> <br />Senator Obama spoke at the Union Square Barnes & Noble just before Thanksgiving this year (2004). My husband and I just happened to be in the shop, and decided to stay to hear him. He proved to be terrifically humble and charismatic as he moved a racially and aged mixed audience of New York strangers to feel like old fashioned neighbors by the end of his 30 minute speech.  <br /> <br />His book is just as good as his live appearance was. He embodies a sane, diverse America, and makes you remember you can too. His memoir shows, unsentimentally and poetically, how altruism is the most practical solution to individual, national, and international woes. Best of all though, his tone remains effortlessly self-un-important. <br />
B00066N8JS|5.0|<br /> Unfortunately, I was not a fan of Nine Inch Nails when \\"The Downward Spiral\\" originally came out in 1994. I was still too young to really appreciate good music yet.  However, luckily I stumbled upon NIN about a year ago and have been a huge fan ever since.  <br /> <br /> Although I think Trent's follow-up to TDS, \\"The Fragile\\" is my favorite NIN release, this is the original masterpiece that got me hooked on the music.  With this re-release, nothing from the original has been compromised...only improved. The sound quality is amazing (heavily improved and I'm only listening on a standard CD player, not a SACD player), and the highs and lows hit harder and more effectively than ever before.  <br /> <br /> The vocals have been made much clearer as well, allowing for Trent's beautiful lyrics to penetrate the ears more effectively.  This 10th Anniversary release is great for the casual listener or hardcore NIN-fanatic alike. The Deluxe packaging is also a nice treat, along with the bonus disc containing remixes, demos and rarities. Highly recommended!  <br /> <br /> [Don't forget to look out for NIN's new album coming out soon entitled, \\"With Teeth\\" as well as the \\"Closure\\" DVD <br />that includes footage from the Self-Destruct Tour (promoting TDS)] <br />
B000669GAI|5.0|Ok since I have every PJ album I will say the remixed versions on here were better but not much of an incentive for me to buy the album. A great set and we can argue all day on what songs they should have put on it but I guess they went with singles only. It is too bad as what makes PJ a great band is the fact that their albums have tons of awesome songs that are not singles. I just wish they would have put out at least some new songs or covers to make this set a must for the PJ fan becasue as it stands, PJ fans already have everything in this set. Anyways if you like any PJ songs and for some reason don't have all their albums, get this and be introduced to the bands entire career.
B000687M48|4.0|1st the cd , A great rockin set from Evanescence , Personally i think The band could improve in getting the riffs Tighter & the Drummer sounds bored to me , when out next to drummers & guitarists from bands like Children of Bodom , Arch enemy , King diamond etc.  that's the way a band should lock in , hopefully in time these guy's will gel as a unit...... But the Songs of this band are so strong it really doesn't matter  , Amy is just great up there & overall it's a really good sounding performance........ <br />  Now the DVD , allthough this concert looks great , who the heck edited this?? & person that drank too much caffeine i'm guessing?? everytime the band really starts rocking the camera shots are literally less that a second before it switches to another canera at times leaving it almost unwatchable.....it's alsmot like looking at a strobe light!! ......Yes they are an exciting band live & it's hard to capture , but could we get 10 seconds per shot?? it's really well done during the slower songs ..... & the lighting is a nice touch..... <br />  Also included are all 4 videos which are all outstanding & must owns in your collection...... the \\"Behind the Scenes\\" stuff is mostly the Band goofing off on the Road trying to be Funny which i didn't think was funny at all , more annoying that anything....allthough seeing stuff like soundchecks , Amy on rollerskates , & the artwork a fan gave her , all stuff i enjoyed seeing....... watching people look for & eat Mcdonalds is boring.......All in all this set is a bargain & any fan of the Band will love it , there's something for everyone here........ Nice to hold us all over til the next cd comes out!!

B00030590I|3.0|This DVD doesn't do justice at all to how beautiful the original movie looks.  I went to the theater 7 or 8 times to watch Hero, liked it really a lot.  This movie is very artistic and beautiful in all respects in my humble opinion.  Colors were so brilliant, scenes so beautiful and sharp, audio was so amazing, music was so great, the story was so simple yet so well structured, and the conclusion of the movie is so poignant and well done.  I was one of the first customers to get the DVD in a local Walmart yesterday night at official release time.  Verdict after watching some scenes, video quality is extremely poor and dissapointing.  If you already have this DVD, or if you rent it, and you think the video quality in this DVD is *not* terrible, just go to the Special features section and watch in amazement how much better the colors look there in the shorts of the movie, compared to how those same scenes look during the actual DVD playback of the movie.  For instance the scene where Nameless walks down the stairs exiting the King's palace, guards all around. During the normal DVD playback of that scene, everything looks grainy, washed out, and way &#34;over burned&#34;, as if it had been filmed with too much light, and with low resolution.  But that is not the case of course, those are just compression artifacts introduced by a terrible transfer.  Go to the special features and see through them, and wait till you see that same scene. There you can see it with MUCH BETTER SATURATED COLORS, BETTER CONTRAST, and DECENT RESOLUTION.  HOW COME THE TRANSFER WAS GOOD FOR THE SHORTS AND PREVIEWS IN THE SPECIAL FEATURES SECTION, BUT NOT FOR THE MOVIE ITSELF IN THE DVD???????  The same applies to pretty much all scenes shown in the Special Features.  Pretty much all of them have better color saturation and balance, and look overall way better than what you see watching the movie from the DVD.  I can't help but feel indignation. It is such a shame that this gorgeous movie received such an unprofessional treatment. This is really one of my favorite movies of all time, and for the movie I'd give 5 starts for sure.  Not to this DVD.  The colors, especially yellows and blues, here are nowhere near as brilliant and saturated as in the movie. The gorgeous fight scene between the two women, with the beautiful swirls of yellow leaves and petals, on the DVD shows terrible washed out yellows, and washed out blue skies in the background. Inside the palace, the blues of the stones are not as saturated as they should be either, and the deep saturated yellow glowing dots in the candles in the original movie, with their rich yellow aura, are barely yellow in the DVD, they could pass as just dim whites.  Also the DVD has parts that seem to be in terrible low grainy resolution, for example the passionate love making scene.  It looks simply terrible and grainy on the DVD, plus with deteriorated colors.  Same as when Nameless walks down the stairs outside the Kings palace, which looks the worst of all.  Most annoyingly, some skin colors in general appear some times purplish and greenish on the DVD. This is all the most disappointing, precisely because something that stood out so beautifully in the original movie was the richness and beauty of the colors.  Putting the Special Features section aside, overall video quality in this DVD is plain shameful, zero stars for that.  Audio sounded really great from the DVD though, no objections there. And this movie has awesome audio and music.  But if there's a movie that video-wise has been poorly transferred to DVD, and deserves a second remastered release, it's this one.  Hopefully it will be released in HD-DVD some day, with much more faithful colors and resolution.  Again if you have it already, or if you rent it, just watch the special features to get a glimpse of how much you are missing.  Addendum: My impressions are based on watching this DVD on my 27&#34; flatscreen Sony Wega TV using its special widescreen mode. I have calibrated this TV as best as possible using the AVIA DVD, but I know the limitations of this display (in particular, most Sony TVs tend to have overpowering reds.)  Even so, just watching the Special Features makes so evident the fact that things could look so much better in this DVD.  About 60 other DVDs I've watched several times with this same equipment, and many of those movies I've also seen a few times on the theaters.  Only with Hero I experienced this major dissapointment and indignation with the colors (and resolution in some parts,) comparing the movie on the DVD vs. how things looked on the big screen, or oddly enough, on the Special Features section!
B0001AVZA8|3.0|So much's been said about Something's Gotta Give, Jack Nicholson poking fun at his own dating younger woman; Diane Keation and Jack Nicholson sharing unmistakable chemistry; and of course, the sweet ending.<br /><br />Something's Gotta Give is as dramtic as any romance movies could get. It illuminates because of the drama and comedy. Diane Keaton's got a nod for Best Actress, quite deservingly so but she gets overdramatic and animated at times. Jack Nicholson doesn't act anymore, he just is the way he is. Well, this role isn't quite as different as his roles in About Scmidth and As Good As It Gets, though he really does it well with that smirk look when his eyes follow Amanda Peet's rear.<br /><br />The plot isn't rocket science though I must say I am more interested in seeing the Keaton-Reeves romance blossom. Reeves lands his most likeable and accomplished role as a doctor who falls for the older woman in the movie. Well, who would have thought he could handle something like this? He's really good as an admirer of Keaton's character. The best scene must be when both younger and older men saw in awe Keaton's character come out of the room in a stunning black dress. Another overlooked performance must be that of Oscar winner Frances McDormand. Her performance in the first 15 minutes already lends much support to Diane Keaton's neurtoic older woman role. She's about as quirky and witty as she can get but then the movie isn't on her. She just shows a nice contrast opposite Keaton.<br /><br />Overall, it's a cloying feel-good movie that will go down with most. Oh ya, next time make Jack a record label owner of some other music genre. Hip-hop? Nah! 3.5 ***
B0000640SB|5.0|Just who are the infamous \\"Men in Black?\\"  For certain paranoid individuals the \\"Men in Black\\" are members of a government agency that appear to cover up incidents involving aliens or possibly the paranormal.  Barry Sonnenfeld takes the theory of a super-secret government agency to an effectively satirical extreme, generating a lot of laughs in the process.<br /><br />This movie opens with Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and Agent D (Richard Hamilton) interrupting a group of INS agents from their interception of a van load of illegal aliens.  For those who have never seen the movie the opening is confusing at first, because Agent K finds a particular individual in the group of illegal aliens and pulls him aside, and then allows the remaining aliens to go free.  We soon discover that the illegal \\"alien\\" that Agents K and D have pulled aside is more than a little different from your average illegal alien, as the alien suddenly sprouts teeth and appears to be ready to chow down on an INS agent.<br /><br />Will Smith is New York City cop James Edwards.  He encounters an extremely agile alien that he keeps pace with for a lengthy time, impressing Agent K.  Agent K asks Edwards to come to a certain location the next day.  Edwards's attempts to take a series of tests that make very little sense to him.  Indeed, Edwards quickly learns that no one taking the test understands why they are taking it.  While it seems to us that Edwards is doing poorly on the tests, he is selected to be one of the \\"Men in Black,\\" and Agent K's new partner.  Edwards is unable to believe that aliens exist, but he is quickly disavowed of that misconception as he meets a number of them in the Men in Black headquarters.<br /><br />While we are introduced to Edwards and the Men in Black, an alien has landed and taken on the visage of Edgar, played by Vincent D'Onofrio.  The alien has come to Earth to obtain a jewel that is being sought by another alien race.  If the other alien race does not get the jewel back, they will destroy the Earth.  Agent K and Edwards, who has now been renamed Agent J, try to locate Edgar and the jewel and save the Earth.<br /><br />While my description of this movie makes it sound as though it is a cheesy B science fiction movie, this movie is actually a nicely plotted comedy that manages to make fun of the \\"Men in Black\\" conspiracy theory and science fiction movies and their aliens.  Things we know can not be possible are shown matter-of-factly and generally always humorously.<br /><br />Take for example the car Agents K and J use to travel about town.  It appears to be a non-descript government car; in other words, boring.  However, the government car has a few little features that make is quite different from the typical government vehicle.  Agent K asks Agent J to fasten his seatbelt.  After a few comments about low-performing government cars, Agent J finds himself on the ceiling of the car while the car travels upside down through a tunnel.<br /><br />The casting of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith in their roles was excellent.  Tommy Lee Jones has an excellent deadpan delivery that allows Will Smith to twist into continuously humorous one-liners from beginning to end.  When Tommy Lee Jones is the butt of Smith's jokes the expression on his face or the serious way in which he responds to Smith provides a number of laughs.  Tommy Lee Jones also gets his moments.  For example, Jones goes after a gun that the alien has swallowed.  Later Jones says, with a straight face, that he really liked that gun, explaining why he asked a huge toothed bug-like alien to eat him.<br /><br />The science fiction story is a framework for a series of jokes, both verbal and situational, that are the heart of this movie.  Because the Men in Black portion of the movie is played straight the humor is wonderfully effective.  This government agency is very serious about what it does, but Will Smith sees the humor in their taking everything too seriously.  Of course,we see the same humor that Will Smith sees in a bunch of stuff shirt government types taking themselves too seriously, and that makes this movie a comedic winner.y.

B0001MDP36|1.0|I don't know what everyone else saw, but this movie has got to be the most BORING! movie of all time. The Academy should've given it an Oscar for that. I've sat through dry and long movies before, but nothing kept putting me to sleep like this one did. It was like watching paint dry. I already knew I wasn't gonna like it, but I tried to give it an honest chance, and it BLOWS! just like I originally thought it would. I expected that with Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellwegger in it this film couldn't lose. I was seriously mistaken. Despite the fact that all those big name A-list stars were in it, I just couldn't connect with it enough to really get into it. I guess the whole \\"love story\\" aspect of the movie was enough to move some people, but I am not easily impressed. Frankly, I wasn't impressed with anything about this movie because it was just sooo slow and drawn out. Let's be honest. If you're into action or suspense this isn't the movie for you. However, if you're suffering from insomnia, and you need something to help you sleep, then pop this movie right into the VCR or DVD player. I promise you it will put you right out.
006054094X|3.0|Gavin Menzies has an interesting slant on navigation and the voyages of discovery in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The important part for me is not whether you, the reader, believe the thesis that he is putting forward, but more whether you have assumptions and ideas yourself that are unquestioned and unquestionable. Is the fact that \\"in fourteen hundred and ninety two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue\\" engrained in your thoughts, so that nothing will shift it? <br /> <br />Did Columbus discover America? Menzies postulates that many of the 'discoveries' by European seamen were following routes and indeed charts where others had gone before. These documents were left by, or based upon, the great Chinese treasure fleets that set sail near Tianjin in early 1421. This was after the lavish celebrations that marked the inauguration of the Forbidden City in Beijing, the new capital of the Emperor.  <br /> <br />The author draws upon his experiences as a mariner, even the commander of a submariner in the British Navy, in the third quarter of 20th century. It is certainly true that a periscope places a different perspective on land observed. He uses his experience to interpret islands from some early charts. These can sometimes be identified as several peaks on the same land mass, indicating that the initial observations took place from some distance away. There are good descriptions of the rudiments of astronavigation, and the importance of specific lines of latitude, some held dear merely because it is the latitude of Beijing.  <br /> <br />If the Chinese fleets (for there were many ships) did circum-navigate the world in the period 1421 - 1423, some difficult questions can be answered. Why are there hens in both North and South America that bear a strong resemblance to Chinese hens? These livestock pre-dated the first western settlers. There are other unusual items found out of their geographical distribution; maize in Indonesia when it is indigenous to South America.However, not all of the questions are answered, and some hard questions using the author's hypothesis are answered by the `conventional' view. <br /> <br />Menzies notes where there is a need for further investigation to corroborate his central hypothesis. This includes asking the Governor of the Falkland Islands for help in discovering a monument stone that may have been erected , and the genetic finger-printing of peoples who may be descendents of some Chinese settlers left behind. There is a great deal of assumptions and calculations (current flow, speed through the water), and whilst any one individual part is no great quantum leap, taken together, the inferences drawn are very significant. At the end I am left thinking that it is an answer, but it is almost a BACKWARD answer, with the hypothesis having been raised, and the book as a justification for the hypothesis. Some with a wide knowledge of cartography have questioned the selectivity of the author, as maps and charts all support his central idea, but there exists other items that do not do this.  <br /> <br />Be all that as it may; it is still worth daring to ask the question. <br /> <br />Peter Morgan, Bath, UK (morganp@supanet.com) <br />
B0006399FS|3.0|Um, Its a good CD, but its not great -- especially by U2 standards.  There are a few on there that are great though. \\"A man and a woman\\" is an incredible song.  The one that has me scratching my head though is \\"Miracle Drug\\"  Huh?  U2 is better than that.  Bono singing \\"miracle drug, a meeeeracle drug.  a meeeeracle drug\\" like 10 times just doesnt do it for me.  I've been listening to U2 forever, I've met Bono twice, and this might be blasphemy -- but I'd be curious to see what they would sound like if they had somebody else produce their next record.  Rick Reuben or something.  U2 has almost seemed to have stagnated and I cant help wondering if they brought in somebody -- somebody that has an enormous respect for their work -- but hasnt been involved with them forever if it might spark something new in them.  Edge totally brings it on this CD though.  The clever, signature Edge sounds are back.  Thank the good lord.  Don't ever get rid of those, but if this CD was mixed/produced differently I think it could be even better.         **Note** I'm editing this on Jul 23, 07 - after reading that Rick Ruben was working with U2 on their next album.  OMG, I'm so smart that i just cut the cheese!

0783229526|5.0|This is one my favorite movies of all time. I have read the book and seen the film several times to know that they coincide pretty well. My favorite thing about this is that it all really happened. I'm a librarian and every book we have by Hunter is non-fiction. Gotta love it!!!<br /><br />I've been to Vegas several times and my boyfriend and I make it a point to sit and drink at the revolving bar at Circus Circus and just laugh thinking of what occurred there.<br /><br />If you like to have a good time, you should have a blast watching this movie.

B00066J1RG|5.0|This is yet another Kylie greatest hits package, but this is the first one feature hits from all phases of her career from the SAW bubblegum years to the experimental Deconstruction years to the thrilling dance-pop in which Kylie elevated herself into Madonna heights.   <br /> <br />Disc One features the Stock-Aitken-Waterman productions including \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\", \\"The Locomotion\\", and the fabulous hits \\"Better The Devil You Know\\", \\"Step Back In Time\\" and \\"Shocked\\", all to keep the party going.  Unfortunately two of Kylie's worst singles, \\"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\\" and \\"Tears In My Pillow\\" are featured here but they were actually big hits in their heyday so that's the reason why they're here.  Disc One basically gathers up the biggest of Kylie's early hits so fans may be disappointed that they don't get \\"It's No Secret\\" or one of Kylie's greatest songs, \\"Finer Feelings\\" which was one of the first songs to introduce a more sophisticated and sexy Kylie. <br /> <br />The second disc starts off strongly with \\"I Believe In You\\" a stunning dance-pop ditty in which Kylie collaborates with the Scissor Sisters, and it's a great combination.  The CD then launches into Kylie's world smash, \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\", which has been overplayed but still sounds fresh today.  It's disappointing that both \\"Love At First Sight\\" and \\"Please Stay\\" are featured here in their album versions and not their popular single versions.  It's also odd that Kylie's mid-90s material, save for \\"Confide In Me\\" is pushed to the end of the album, not interspersed with her recent smashes.  But you can't go wrong with this two-disc collection that will be a party staples for years.
B000066NW0|5.0|avril lavigne is a great artist. she came out of nowhere and hit us with 'complicated'. that song was so hot... she seemed different from the britney's and the jessicas and x-tinas.... im not going to lie she is a terrible singer live but she does hold her own... <br /> <br />the 2 best tracks on this album are 'losing grip' and 'sk8er boi'... 'losing grip' hit hard because it is the first song on the album... this is a way to start an album... 'sk8er boi' is just a crazy overall track... i never heard a song about a jealous girl like the way she sang in this song...  <br /> <br />'nobody's fool', 'naked', 'im with you', and 'mobile' are just tight to def... she  is a great writer... for 20 she does write grown up stuff... <br /> <br />this album is way better than her 2nd album.... i just hope her 3rd effort does better than her 2nd... <br /> <br />5 stars out of 5
B0000DZ3IG|1.0|I have not bought this CD yet, but I read the reviews that it does not contain the song: Christmas is all around. How could they leave that out? That would have been my main reason to buy it. Now I do not have to waste my money on it.
B0000C8AV2|4.0|Many consider the late 1980s a slump for Dylan. After the box set \\"Biograph\\" - which plays like a lifetime achievement award - was released Dylan put out a string of questionable albums: \\"Knocked Out Loaded\\" (almost universally panned at the time), \\"Down in the Groove\\" (which did yield the minor hit \\"Silvio\\"), and \\"Dylan and the Dead\\" (great for Grateful Dead fans, but not so great for anti-Dead Heads). Juxtaposed with \\"Biograph\\", which highlighted some of Dylan's greatest music, this lineup looked even more dour. In fact, some praised Dylan's contributions to 1988's \\"The Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1\\" more than his recent solo work. Things were indeed looking bad for Bob.<br /><br />Enter \\"Oh Mercy\\" which, in light of the above, felt like a complete Reniassance. Shouts of \\"comeback\\" rumbled through the hills while Dylan devotees let out a huge collective sigh. He seemed to care again. What allowed this miracle to happen? Dylan recently claimed in \\"Chronicles Vol. 1\\" that \\"Oh Mercy\\" did indeed signal the end of a long slump. He claims to have been uninspired, going through the motions, and not sure why he was doing what he was doing. The negation of all of this is very audible on 1989's \\"Oh Mercy\\".<br /><br />\\"Political World\\" explodes the listener into a new renergized Dylan. He even sang about politics again. The first half of the album contains some of Dylan's strongest 1980's material: After \\"Political World\\", there's \\"Where Teardrops Fall\\", the slightly tongue-in-cheek \\"Everything is Broken\\", \\"Ring Them Bells\\" (reminding us that Dylan's \\"Christian Phase\\" was more than a phase), and the amazing \\"Man in the Long Black Coat\\" (including the great Dylan line \\"People don't live or die, people just float\\"). Solid material all the way through. The second half doesn't have the umph of the first, but plenty of strong material exists here also: The slightly funny, slightly forlorn \\"Most of the Time\\", the introspective and questioning \\"What Good Am I?\\", and the reflective ending track \\"Shooting Star\\". \\"Disease of Conceit\\" and the slightly confusing \\"What was it You Wanted?\\" are the album's weak, but not intolerable, spots.<br /><br />Dylan's career did seem to take off after \\"Oh Mercy\\". The 1990s found him releasing acclaimed albums once again (\\"World Gone Wrong\\" and \\"Time Out of Mind\\"). In this respect, \\"Oh Mercy\\" marked an incredible comeback - in a series of comebacks - for one of America's most influential artists.\\"Shooting Star\\". \\"Disease of Conceit\\" and the slightly confusing \\"What was it You Wanted?\\" are the album's weak, but not intolerable, spots. <br />Dylan's career did seem to take off after \\"Oh Mercy\\".

B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album was recorded in 1979, just about when The Clash peaked. The songs on this album are a combination of punk energy and new, experimental sounds. The result is an awe-inspiring piece of mastery. <br /> <br />This album rocks from start to finish never losing momentum or slowing down. If you are a fan of The Clash, I recommend this album. If you aren't a fan of The Clash, I recommend this album even more. If you haven't listened to this album, you haven't heard real music.
B0002ZDVF4|5.0|I have to agree with most that this was well worth the watch! I loved the first Bourne movie, a surprise to me to see Matt Damon look and act so appealing! Not a usual fan of his - but afterwards... whoopee! I never heard of the books or read them, so the differences don't bother me from the plots of the books to film version.<br /><br />I was excited to see the second in the series but was disappointed that Marie was killed off so quickly, letting us know that it is all action from here. I didn't mind the little scenery slip-ups, I try not to go to movies to pick them apart (waste of money & time I think!) so it all looked good to me and the camera was so scatty that to focus on one thing would have been hard, saying that, I didn't mind the fast paced camera shots - felt like I was on a ride the entire 2 hours!<br /><br />As I had a look at what Amazon offers, I see there was a TV series in the late 80's that kept closer to the book and Marie (Jacklyn Smith - can you imagine?) was Bourne's wife and was also in all 3 books -so I am sad we lost her early in the 2nd - interesting to see how they make up for that in the 3rd movie to bring us ladies back to fill the seats! As we liked the bathroom/hair cutting scene of Identity and it was missed in the 2nd!!<br /><br />Thumbs up to this one, I know I'll add it to my collection!

B0006399FS|5.0|I've been a U2 fan since my early teens. Some of my fondest High School memories from the mid-80's involve watching MTV in science class--and seeing videos like \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"All Is White On New Year's Day\\". (I know, we should have been learning science...)<br /><br />I enjoy how U2 has evolved as a band, although my favorite era *was* the mid-80's.<br /><br />This CD changed all that.<br /><br />If it wasn't for Vertigo playing on commercials, I may not have given this CD a change. \\"Beautiful Day\\" (also played in commercials at the time) sucked me into buying the CD \\"All That You Can Leave Behind\\". Unfortunately, that CD is U2's worst, in my opinion (save for \\"Beautiful Day\\" which is a great song).<br /><br />My husband and I bought \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" over the weekend, and put it in the car CD player for the drive home. \\"Vertigo\\" sounded amazing in our stereo system; I heard a lot of nuances that you don't really hear from the commercials.<br /><br />Surprisingly, *every one of the songs* on this CD is masterful. With \\"All That You Can Leave Behind\\", I remember being bored to death and just wanting it OUT of the CD player. With U2's new CD, however, they have put together an eclectic blend that mixes a bit of their vintage sound with a fresh direction. Even the slower songs on this CD are a joy to listen to, as opposed to being boring and flat.<br /><br />The lyrics are clever, insightful, and (as usual) heartfelt. I especially like Yaweh, which explores spiritual longing and questions with honesty that's not sentimental.<br /><br />There are gorgeous layers to each song, with a catchy bass line reminiscent of the mid-80's era. Yet, this CD is unmistakenly a fresh U2 that keeps going strong: intelligent lyrics, skiled musicianship, smooth vocals, and engaging tempos that suck you right into the beat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD. My Mom (not a rock fan and a devout Christian) commented that she really liked Vertigo when she heard it on TV. After hearing the entire CD, I'm seriously considering buying *her* \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" for Christmas!Vertigo when she heard it on TV. After hearing the entire CD, I'm seriously considering buying *her* \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" for Christmas!
B0002KP5FI|1.0|Although I'm a fan of Conte 's work , I've been  disappointed by that \\"new\\" direction. <br />It says on the cover that Nicola plays the guitar but you can't really hear any guitar on the tracks .The solos are good , especially the trumpet but the vocals (appart from Sea & Sun ) are poor and the lyrics are childish.There's even one french song were you can't understand a word. Maybe italian lyrics would have been more original!
B0001LYH98|2.0|Despite being a huge Bowie fan, I found this album to be very ordinary, which is difficult to say about anything by Bowie. There are a few great moments. \\"Seven\\" for instance is a fantastic stripped down song (well sort of stripped down) and is easily the best on the album. \\"Something in the Air\\" is great as well and I like the American Psycho Remix even better. \\"If I'm Dreaming my Life\\" is the second best song on here (and 7 minutes long).  <br /> <br />But overall, this album really lacks any emotion at all. On the above mentioned tracks it works very well, but with the other songs there seems to be no extra movement.  <br /> <br />I got the version of this album with the extra tracks and to me it's not really worth it, except for the American Psycho Remix of Something in the Air. I didn't like \\"The Pretty Things are Going to Hell\\" even though it seems everyone else does. Belongs in his bad '80s collection quite frankly. But if you have to have everything by Bowie, then get it for those three songs and maybe \\"Thursday's Child\\".

Fair enough there are many good bands today but Guns N Roses are legends. Its just a pity that some strange people can't see that. Also i dont appreciate why some people have to be so rude about it. Also if i had the chance i would marry AXL as he is the greatest and i just hope from the bottom of my heart that he gets chinese democracy finished. Thanks :) xxx
0671015206|3.0|I agree with many of the statements and opinions given in this book, like how the rich live below their means even though they have the opportunity to splurge on everything they want. I felt, however, that the information was redundant and slightly boring. When I chose this book in the first place, I thought it might be an interesting look into the high-income world of flashy cars and mansions. Instead, it turned out to be a relatively bland account with the same ideas repeated over and over in different ways. I'm just not a fan of this book, although the ideals and rules for richness seem relevant and attainable.

B0006284JQ|3.0|While I generally believe that musical artists should not release a Best of or Greatest Hits cd until at least a decade after their debut album, Britney has amassed a string of hits in her brief time in the public eye.  Her debut album was surprisingly good for \\"bubblegum pop\\", with the right mix of catchy hooks and ballads.  Her second album was appropriately titled, as she \\"did it again\\", repeating the winning formula of her first cd.  Then, things went downhill from there.  Britney Spears' is a perfect example of what I learned in my Intro to Economics course in college:  the law of diminishing returns.  With each successive album, particularly music video, she's had to up the ante on sexual titillation in order to make headlines, but with each successive album, she has sold less and less.  There isn't much she can do to shock the music buying public these days...let's face it, she's no Madonna.  At least Madonna showed artistic growth on her fourth album, \\"Like a Prayer\\".  The best Britney could do for round four was a disappointing collaboration with the former Material Girl herself.  The biggest surprise to me is why Britney has never released what I consider her most catchiest and best song ever as a single:  \\"Anticipating\\".  That song is infectious and addicting, perfect in its beats and rhythm.  With this collection of her first half-decade of hits, I hope it closes a chapter in her need to get our attention sexually.  I hope that she will grow as an artist, with more personal songs that delve deeper into her being to prove that she is more than a Barbie doll in the flesh.  She obviously remade \\"My Prerogative\\" for a reason...as a defense for her past choices in spite of the controversy.  Its sad when an artist, like Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston, uses their music to rip at the critics and the controversies.  At least Madonna was tongue in cheek in her rebuke (\\"Human Nature\\") and didn't dwell on it song after song.  My advice to Britney would be to completely change direction and stun critics and music listeners alike by dropping her sex tease act and really dig deep in her soul and create an album that will stand the test of time.  It's obvious that her trajectory hasn't produced greater album sales, and if Madonna is the artist Britney emulates, its worth nothing that even Madonna couldn't manage to reach platinum level with her last album (\\"American Life\\") and has to resort to a career change as a children's book author to keep her name in the media.  Remember, Britney:  Law of Diminishing Returns.  Try a new theme and dive below the surface for your second act (the life after the greatest hits album).
B000002UJQ|2.0|I understand why people still salivate over this record. If you like Thom Yorke sounding like a dog begging for a walk, Johnny Greenwood  playing guitar in boxing gloves, lyrics that I thought were deep until I read some poetry  (Brodsky,T.S Elliot, whatever) - you'll consider this the best record ever made/blablabla but ,seriously, EVEN SOME OF YOU eventually will get tired of it.<br />Me,I've just about had enough of Radiohead.<br />I never once regretted selling my copy of OK Computer.
B0006399FS|5.0|It is just a great piece of work.  There are a few things I would liked to see differently, a few lines that don't come out right, a couple strains in Bono's voice, a couple drum riffs that sound bland, but overall they get overshadowed by the great songs overall.   <br /> <br />Essential track: \\"All Because of You\\"
B00005N5S5|5.0|There are several reasons why the first Terminator was and still is better than its sequels. <br />   First of all, even if one sees it now, 20 years after its original release it still holds its ground with particular tech-noir ease. It doesn't look dated and it actually gains charm as time goes by rather than lose any. <br /> <br />    Then it's also the \\"feel\\" this film has. It still retains this unmistakable \\"indie film\\" quality allthough for its time back then it was definetely high budget. All the dark, industrial superbly edited scenes contribute to that feeling, and J.Cameron did a memorable job creating a film that was expensive but kept you watching not because of ultra-flashy effects, but because of an intriguing storyline, great directing, good to very good performances, and cool visuals. <br /> <br />    Speaking of the storyline, in T1 it happens to be more consistent and solid than in the following Terminator installments. It's a solid script deserving of a classic sci-fi film, one that puts the T1 in a pantheon of great futuristic films. <br /> <br />   Its superiority lies also in the fact that T1 is dark and ominously threatening in its entirety. The coldness and the relentlessness of the cyborg is its trademark sign and that's what sets its unique atmosphere. If it has lost something is that fact that the back-then not so famous protagonist has since become a megastar and a governor on top of it. This takes somewhat away from the charm of not being familiar with the actors but it's ultimately not enough to harm the film. <br /> <br />   Cameron kept the effects at a minimum and yet managed to give his film a dominant aura of technological-doom. He used more industrial visuals of the present than of the future to achieve this and he was succesful by a good margin. It was after all one of his very best films. <br /> <br />   The Terminator's machoism is well disguised underneath its fake skin and Arnold was a perfect cast for this role. He wasn't consumed enough back then to be taken in as funny even if he delivered lines like \\"I'll be back\\" or pronounces names with a German accent (Sarah Cannah anyone?). <br /> <br />   One of the top 20 sci-fi films of all time. <br />     <br /> <br />     <br /> <br />
0393316041|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book \\"Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman\\". This book is very interesting and it was very hard to put down. The many anecdotes kept me laughing and wanting more. Even though the events occurred before present day, many of the stories can still capture in intrigue of the youth of America today. This book is one of my new favorites even though the only reason I read it was for a physics project. I am happy to know that there are other books by Mr. Feynman such as \\"What do YOU care what other people think?\\". I have actually already purchased this book and cant wait to begin reading it. I enjoyed this book because not only is it science, but it is also fun science! I have never been a great admirer of the science world, but Mr. Feynman's book helped me change my entire outlook.
1592400876|4.0|I picked this book up a few times because the title captivated me only to put it down again because I wasn't sure I'd really like a book on punctuation.  Finally, I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did because I enjoyed it a lot.  I believe the way a book is written is more important than the subject matter.  A good author can make any subject interesting and compelling and that is exactly the case here.
B00063EMJ6|2.0|Yes, the songs here are all great, so it's hard to give it just two stars. But it's a complete rip-off. I have all these songs already, most of them on the wonderful Decade double CD from 1977. Why on earth would I spend the money just to add five songs that weren't on Decade and which I already have on other CDs anyway? I agree with reviewers who say Young has sold out. He used to be his own person, thumbing his nose at MTV and the music industry. I guess those days are gone. Also, the song selection here is about as dull as possible, with nothing included from Neil's recent past (Greendale, for instance) or from his \\"dark\\" period of the mid-1970's (Time Fades Away, On the Beach, Tonight's the Night). Anyone who wants to really understand the artist should start with those three albums, not this Christmas season offering from a money-grubbing record company. And yes, I too am appalled that another reviewer on this page mis-identified \\"A Horse with No Name\\" as a Neil Young song. Ugh!
B00005JLPK|5.0|Frida is one of the best films about someone's life I've seen in a long time. Usually such films tend to be self involved or leave out important details. With Frida there is a good mix of everything. <br /> <br />The visuals of the film are striking and in some places unique in the way it shows Frida's paintings almost coming to life. Her relationship with Muralist Diego Rivera is shown exactly how it was: harsh, violent but passionate. In the end, despite the infidelity of both husband and wife numerous times, their enduring love and respect for each other as artists and comrades out lasted any lingering problems they had. <br /> <br />Alfred Molina and Selma Hayek give truely great performances and fit their characters personalities well. I hadn't been a huge fan of Selma before this film but even though I'm still not, her acting here has proven me that when given the right material, she can be just as good an actress as the best of them. <br /> <br />The music present in the film is gripping and soaring. The voice of singer Lila Downs cutting through triumphantly. The traditional Mexican music is well done and a joy to listen to. In the end I highly recommend this film on all fronts: acting, music, direction, plot and cinematography.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. From the prelude to the ending son, it keeps me rockin! Circle is my favorite song thus far, so good to get drunk too and lets the emotions fly! .
B00005JMAH|3.0|This movie is a great movie on its own. Put it next to the book and you will be greatly disappointed. Book 3 is my favorite of the series but my least favorite movie. <br />The book misses major series mythology points. The most gaping hole is the Marauder's Map. For me leaving this out destroyed the movie for me. Although this being said the greatest disappointment for me was the lack of the Dumbledore/Harry moment at the end. All of the books have them and I was extremely saddened and disappointed that this was left out. They did incorporate elements of the Dumbledore/Harry scene from the book into the Lupin/Harry scene in the movie but there is an element between Harry and Dumbledore that was lost. I think this will effect how non-book audiences view the Dumbledore/Harry relationship in the next two movies. Especially the fifth one.  <br />Another part about the movie I hated was the womping willow interludes. Total waste of time. <br /> <br />As far a the DVD goes the case is completely different from the first two. It is in a hard case which is great! The extras on the DVD leave a lot to be desired. I expected more from the deleted scenes. Interviews with the cast are fun but the Shrunken Head bit is annoying.  <br /> <br />The shining gem of this DVD is the interview with JK Rowling in which she states that the movie contains a couple of clues as to what happens in upcoming books. This will sure get us watching the movie over and over guessing at what clues have been left for us. <br /> <br />In the end Harry has survived Voldemort and we shall survive Alfonso Cuaron.
B000687M48|5.0|It's without question. This is something all Evanescence fans need in their collection! I notice this to be something a lot of artists are doing these days, and it probably is just a ploy to cash in, but I personally enjoy live CDs, and especially DVDs, so you can relive the experience or merely feed your curiosity if you missed one of your favorite groups in concert. I haven't seen Evanescence in person yet but after watching the DVD portion of 'Anywhere But Home', which was taped at a sold-out venue in Paris, I definitely think it would be worth it to try sometime. Amy Lee looks innocent yet deadly, her haunting vocals are in healthy form and the band sounds better than ever whilst they perform their greatest hits...which is basically everything since their melodies are all so unforgettable....<br /><br />Many people claim Amy doesn't sing as well in concert as she does on her studio recordings and though they may be right, take into consideration the fact that she obviously gets really into the songs and because she jumps around so much, which equals exhaustion and breathlessness, I felt she did a pretty damn good job at controlling the words and pacing. You'll notice during the songs she sings while sitting at the piano, like on the wonderful Korn cover of \\"Thoughtless\\", the stunningly emotional \\"Breathe No More\\", and of course the infamous \\"My Immortal\\" she sounds quite better. Also, during a live event if you mess up there's no turning back so be grateful she doesn't lip synch like countless other acts around. And I'm so sick of people dissing this group simply because they had a lucky break and hit it big thanks to the 'Daredevil' soundtrack. I'm not saying Evanescence is better than similar groups who get far less recognition (or at least in the states) like Lacuna Coil, 'cause they're not, but they've also been around a while now so their fame didn't exactly happen over night.<br /><br />Bottom line is they've got undeniable talent and they are, in my opinion, a blessing to mainstream music which is mostly full of crap. But back to the CD/DVD combo...<br /><br />Closing the set is the new, or rather recycled track \\"Missing\\" (originally found on their hard-to-find 'Origins' CD) and it's a beautiful orchestral ballad, however it's the DVD that's truly spectacular! Aside from the concert it also features a lot of bonus material, and it isn't just filler either. The behind the scenes is great because you get to see a little of how they are in real life and it's not at all boring. It also includes all their videos to date, which are some of the most inventive I've seen in a long time (\\"Everybody's Fool\\" is without a doubt my favorite). And for the most part the concepts actually relate to the lyrics.<br /><br />I predict Evanescence will be around for many years to come and I can't wait to hear their new album set for release sometime next year.opinion, a blessing to mainstream music which is mostly full of crap.

B0006399FS|5.0|For me, U2 is bar-none the only band that hits me collectively and effectively at 3 different and very poignant angles.  From least to most affecting, I will list: <br /> <br />3.)  The foot <br />2.)  The heart <br />1.)  The MIND <br /> <br />While it's rather prosaic for music to make one want to bounce in his seat, and even for music to touch one's soul, I have always been so touched and astonished at their reflective lyrics.  Every time I hear one of their songs on XM Radio, its lyrics have enough depth and purport to keep me pondering over all of the references in the verses for the rest of the day.   <br /> <br />U2 and their lyrics are conscious socially, politically, and religiously, as they continue on singing to the Lord - making their music an incredibly refreshing change from the garbage street music that taints the charts today. <br /> <br />After a quarter of a century, I can say that this album exhibits no more meaning, depth, and spirituality than did their albums from the '80's.  A putdown?  Hardly.  The fact that these 4 - particularly Bono, of course - have consistently demonstrated such profoundness since their very first album as kids barely out of secondary school deserves some recognition.  Their music is consonant, agreeable ... but it forever challenges you and makes you think.  I adore U2 and all they stand for - and their latest album proves, as usual, to be no disappointment.
B000001Y2U|3.0|Most of the music here is pretty bad, but this freak has a message here. If there was only song to go with it, he'd do better getting his message across. You can't make people listen to what you have to say if you hide it behind noise. Some of this stuff isn't all that bad because the production is good, but there is no talent as far as playing goes.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|Look: stop griping. Stop worrying about your lives. Shaun, eponymous cricket-bat wielding hero and ambitionless Foree Electronics employee, has *real* problems. For instance:<br /><br />1) His love life sucks.<br /><br />2) His professional life sucks.<br /><br />3) His best friend is a hopeless slacker who has turned his couch into a kind of fetid nest and spends his entire days wasting away playing X-Box.<br /><br />4) Oh, and the Dead Walk: Zombies are walking the streets of London and tearing up flesh, and they're equal opportunity offenders with a taste for the guts of any Briton, yuppie *or* slacker.<br /><br />This is one of those rare little horror gems in which you can believe the hype---and frankly, when I went to see \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", I was already set *against* the movie: I hate flicks that come to the megaplex ready to do battle after having been given a Super Hype Aerial Shock & Awe campaign by the Indie Movie Establishment.<br /><br />I stand corrected: \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is a zombie movie/horror movie/movie-of-all-time classic, and easily ranks in my top three zombie movies ever made. And mind you, I live, eat, breathe, sleep, and chainsaw these things. Yes, those who hate horror will tell you they love \\"Shaun\\" because it's all about \\"characters\\": ; Shaun (Simon Pegg, the flick's writer and note-perfect as the reluctant zombie slayer), a one-time pathetic directionless loser who gets *very* good with a cricket bat; Liz (Kate Ashfield, very plummy), Shaun's disaffected squeeze who wants to \\"live a little\\"; Mum (Penelope Wilton as \\"Barbara\\"), always looking on the Sunny Side even when she's undergoing a really major life change (as in, dietary change, as in, sudden interest in blood and guts); Philip (the amazing English actor Bill Nighy, who I didn't even recognize in this flick---he played the Uber-Vampire Viktor in \\"Underworld\\"---who knew?), who takes care of his Jaguar to the bitter end.<br /><br />Yeah, it has characters.<br /><br />But you know something? \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is a full-bodied, full-blooded horror movie. It's just one of those rarest of ghoulish gemstones: a horror movie with a wickedly black sense of humor and an impeccable, deeply British, sense of timing. And the timing here is perfect. For my money, the scene in which Shaun goes for some beer in his devastated, zombie-overrun London burb---completely oblivious to the carnage---is one of the best sequences in cinematic history.<br /><br />I haven't seen \\"Spaced\\", the TV series that \\"Shaun\\" director Edgar Wright helmed, but I can say that for a relative newcomer Wright can wield a mean camera. He's backed up by cinematographer David Dunlap, who serves as heavy weapons tech on on the cinematic black magic: my God, this movie looks good! And let's back up a bit---this flick was shot for 4 million bucks. For 4 million bucks, Edgar Wright has conjured up a trillion times the ungodly flesh-eating slack-jawed glassy-eyed zombie horror that \\"Resident Evil 2\\" did---and *that* movie cost 10 times that much. Question: which flick delivered the most pure, unadulterated, zombie-brain-blasting goodness?<br /><br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" succeeds, largely, by animating more than just dead bodies. First off, don't believe the \\"romantic comedy\\" angle---yeah, Shaun has to square the circle with his lovey, but this is a brutal, no holds-barred, don't skimp on the Red Sauce and juicy intestines Captain kinda flick. It's intensely horrific, insanely gripping, and happily disgusting. I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />And best of all, this is one of the few zombie flicks that really burrow down into the guts of what it's like to have to put down someone you love: someone who's confused, who loved you, who tucked you into bed at night when you were a kid, who now exists for one thing and one thing only---to tear off the top of your scalp and sink her cancred yellow tusks into your brainpan. \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" brings it all home with a double-basrreled shotgunof dread, and for that I salute Edgar Wright.<br /><br />But look: the real triumph of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is that it sets up a seamless, banal, everyday urban environment, and overruns it with pure horror. And you *believe* it. You are engaged: when Shaun and Ed (Nick Frost in priceless rat-faced X-Box playing slacker mode) confront a zombie in their backyard, they don't know what to do with the thing. Is she drunk? They laugh, up to the point where she bares her fangs and tries to give Shaun an impromptu tracheotomy.<br /><br />Now: watch Shaun and Ed's reaction when they're putting their first zombie down. This is not irony: not humor: not comedy: it's pure, unadulterated horror and something more---and that something more is what fuels \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", and makes it the classic it is: it is a ferocious, angry sadness---indignation!---at the passing of the world they knew, the world of X-Box, Indian take-out, ruthless slacking, late-night binges, and drinking bouts at the Winchester. It's the end of the world as we know it, and we don't feel fine. To be honest, we feel murderous.

B00005RYLE|5.0|I Totally like the film. Ever since I saw the original VHS  tape version. And to my knowledge there are a few different versions that exist. The Limited Edition \\"Book of the Dead\\" version, Latex  cover and all really falls into the \\"Absolutely got to have it because I am an insane fan\\" category. <br />If someone at Sam's production House actually worked up a proper copy of the Book of the Dead ( Necronomicon? ) together with a copy of the film dagger prop, then people would likely part with bundles of cash to get it, well ... tops for me might be 150 dollars. <br />Anyways, the content of the book of the dead is fairly lame. Nice to have as a prop .... scares the hell out of anyone who sees it in my collection ( alongside of Eddie's Archives ). <br />The added items in the DVD  make it worth the money in some ways, but if people on the production side maybe thought like a fan, and produced fan based products ( i.e.  some sort of decent quality, and maybe even asked some fans what they wanted) then perhaps these special editions would bring in more, since the price would be appropriate. <br />
0452270073|5.0|Despite being a long-time reader of several WWI poets (Owen, Brooke, Sassoon, etc.), I only got around to reading this book last summer (2004).  I found it an excellent interpretation of the times and people.  I think that the issues raised in the work are timeless, as apt today as yesterday.  Moreover, (risking some sense of gender neutrality) the book is hauntingly in tune with \\"maleness,\\" coming, as it were, from a female author.  In other words, this is a perceptive work, underrated despite any of the stars I might give it.  This is a book of interest to the casual reader and the scholar alike.
B000000W6F|5.0|This album helped me expand my musical horizons and my mind--A very complete CD--Tristessa and Snail are my favorites but this whole album kicks ass--reminds me of college days in the early 90's and lots of Sweet SIU KB!
B0002XDODU|5.0|I get a kick out of the reviews that begin \\"i'm a huge Rammstein fan\\", \\"love all their stuff\\", have everything they ever made\\", blah blah blah! I've read many reviews for Reise, Reise, and am baffled at these \\"die-hards\\" who whine that Rammstein's gone soft, that they've changed their style, it's not the Rammstein of the past, cry cry cry, boo hoo hoo! lol Could be you're all spoiled? Or maybe it's just no sense? But if anyone can honestly say after listening to the latest masterpiece from Rammstein that this cd doesn't kick total [...], I have some swamp land in Florida i'd be glad to sell you! :P Reise, Reise get's the show off to a heavy and worthy start before it's kicked up a notch with Mein Teil, easily my favorite track and surely the hardest rocking one on the entire cd. While kicking it back down a notch for tracks 3 & 4 (Dalai Lama & Keine Lust), they're still hard and heavy enough to keep up the furious pace! Track # 5 is the most interesting song on the cd, and possibly one of the best. Los is a mix of rock-a-billy/be-bop/boogie German style! And it definitely works folks! lol I guess this is what the \\"they've changed boo hoo\\" crowd was talking about? Regardless, this song is the perfect compliment as well a short breather for the heavy stuff coming up next. I imagine tracks 6 & 7..Amerika & Moskau..will be the most popular tracks on the cd? Not my 2 favorites however, but still hard and rocking enough to make them worthy of a place in the line-up. Track #8, Morgenstern, revs the show back up to it's earlier fury, followed by a slower but just as heavy track # 9, Stein Um Stein. Ohne Dich & Amour finish off the show in typical Rammstein fashion; the perfect encores to a really great and powerful cd! Reise, Reise may not be the best cd Rammstein has ever made (Herzeleid is my pick)? But it's certainly a great cd, from one of the truly great bands in the world! If you're a Rammstein fan, you're a fool if you don't pick this one up! 5 stars for AWESOME!
1577311523|4.0|This book is Advanced Spirituality....not Enlightenment 101.  It is at once astounding, amazing, exhilirating, disheartening, and dreadful.  I also found it, at times, a difficult read.  The author's usage of terms caused me to continuously page backward to refresh my memory on previous usages.  \\"Presence, essence, Being, the Now, One Life, the Source, the I am, the Unmanifested, pure consciouness, enlightened consciousness, God, God-essence, the manifested, inner body, pain-body, the Christ, deep consciousness, transformation, inner energy fields, higher vibrational states, transmutation (whew).... just to begin the list.   <br /> <br />Tolle is now Zen-Master, now Christian mystic, now New Age metaphysical guru, now atomic physicist.  It is difficult to get a feel as to the exact paradigm he is coming from. <br /> <br />Which, you get the feeling, is exactly the point of the book.  There is no paradigm, only Being.  And as such all paradigms must fit in somewhere, somehow.  He does an admirable job at integrating the religions, the sciences and the mystical.  Those of an Eastern bent will likely have no problem with his teaching, however die-hard, conservative Christians will undoubtably have trouble with the \\"mystical\\" Jesus, and his description of \\"the Christ\\". <br /> <br />To the author's credit he admonishes the reader to not get caught up in the words, as they hold little meaning to the actual state of enlightenment when it is realized, and only serve as crude descriptors here.  There is some instruction in the book, but that isn't it's focus and further instruction seems necessary.   <br /> <br />I had several \\"Aha\\"s in the reading of this book.  Parts that made sense, parts that made perfect sense, and parts that I had to reserve judgement on.  But Tolle's writing is lucid and fluid, it feels authoritative and never wavers from chapter to chapter.  You get the feeling he \\"knows\\" what he's writing about. <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed the book, but, again,it felt advanced to me.  First timers into spirituality and enlightenment may wish to start with some lighter fare, and even begin meditation before tackling this book as it may make the concepts and descriptions a bit easier to grasp.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Music wise this album is alright. Thats why it gets 2 stars.  <br /> <br />However, as one of the few people here who actually likes America I find that in these tmes making a song about what a craphole America is horrible taste.

B00004Y2FT|5.0|I am not really familiar with The Cocteau Twins music except for their enchanting album \\"Treasure\\" and now \\"Stars and Topsoil: a Collection (1982-1990)\\". I bought \\"Treasure\\" last year on a whim. I had always wanted to check out their music. I had heard a song or two by the Scottish trio over the years but I couldn't remember them. I liked what I heard and thought they were worth looking into. I immediately fell under Elizabeth Frasier's haunting vocals. She has one of the most incredible voices in pop music. No one really sings like her. Her voice can be fragile yet powerful at the same time. Robin Guthrie's shimmering guitar riffs complements Elizabeth's delicate vocals. Listening to The Cocteau Twins' music is such a joy to listen to. I especially love the addictive \\"Sugar Hiccup\\" which is simply irresistably infectious and the swirling sounds of \\"Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops\\". I am also a big fan of \\"Lorelei\\" and \\"Pandora\\" too. I thought \\"Stars and Topsoil\\" is a great introduction to newer listeners like myself and gives me a broad idea of the band's music. I loved all the songs. As I listened to the cd, I could hear their influence on bands like Black Tape For a Blue Girl and Lycia iwth their haunting, ethereal pop melodies. I defintely plan on picking up the band's other remastered albums in the near future
0783225792|4.0|But that was what Sam Rothstein did anyway and look how that turned out? Beautiful, isn't it?    I must say, though, Sharon Stone gave a grade A performance in this movie. I'm not a fan of her by any stretch of the imagination, but she was great in this movie! However, her performance was surpassed by Joe Pesci and Rober De Niro, of course.    When reviewing this movie, people tend to compare it to GoodFellas, and I can see why. After all, there is a similar casting, a similar plot of uprising then downfall (but then again, not many gangster movies I know don't have this kind of plot). Despite it, I think that this movie shouldn't be compared to GoodFellas.    I myself like the similar casting (also the irony of Frank Vincent in this movie), but the contrast between this movie and GoodFellas is pretty high. One of the more noticeable differences is the lack of secrecy in the murders. For example, you would know who's going to get killed. The mobsters in this movie makes it very obvious and they also do it pretty openly, except for a few cases. On the other hand, secrecy is completely vital in GoodFellas. To top it off, there is barely any killing in this movie. Well, compared to GoodFellas anyway. Aside from this, there are also many differences.    Yes, I acknowledge the many similarities, but they're both in the same genre (gangster), so you got to have some leverage. If they're in the same genre and created by the same director, then you can't honestly expect them to be completely different. Sure, they may be completely different, but the chances of that are not likely.    Now, on to the movie itself. I must say that it is very good. It shows the rise of a man named Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein who is given a casino by mob bosses. He is very good at what he does and makes an unbelievable amount of money. Soon, a clause by the name of Nicky Santoro is brought into the mix. He causes trouble, but everything soon works out.    Here, though, both of the main characters beginmaking fatal mistakes. Rothstein falls in love with a woman and decides to marry her. The problem is that she is a VERY VERY high price woman. All for her, Rothstein invest a HUGE sum of money and jewelry in her name. Santoro's own mistake here is that he takes a liking to her. The mistake is that affairs are looked down upon in the mafia. These few mistakes could have easily been fixed, but a few more mistakes soon ensured that everyone would be in trouble.    Personally, I like the flow of the story. Some people might consider it slow since the movie is very long in comparison to others, but I thought it was just right. You knew trouble was going to come, but the story develops the events accordingly rather than let you assume what led to it. I personally thinks it makes the story rich. However, I have a problem with the ending.    Now, I have only watched two other Martin Scorsese movie before this, but I could already tell that this guy does not do very good endings. I watched Mean Streets and the ending was kind of inconclusive and also confusing. I watched GoodFellas and the ending was anti-climactic. In this movie, the ending was somewhat unrealistic. I mean, it seemed like none of the guys were expecting any trouble, despite how they should have. They just sort of went out with a *POOF* rather than a *BANG*, even Santoro.    Oh well, the rest of the movie was still good. The ending is the only reason the story got a 4 rather than a 5. I assured any potential new viewers here that the movie is quite good. Catch it if you can!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminem returned a little after 2 years for his sophomore project, one that would be at the time the fastest selling rap album ever and in the long run selling upwards to 10 million copies.  A good album but my least favorite (along with Encore) of his 4 solo ones.  Not as comical as his first, but it still has its moments, as well as a few more darker songs about his family and his growing up.  Features a few more guests on this one, and Dre handled a little more of the production, doing about two thirds of the albums beats.  Has about 2 or 3 songs that I skip but has about 3 classics as well.

B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is back again 2 years after his HUGE selling \\"Marshall Mathers LP\\" with maybe his best album he's made (close toss up with his first album).  Once again he made an album that sold many millions and lived up to its hype.  Production on this one is handled by Eminem and Dr. Dre much like his newest installment \\"Encore\\".  Has four songs that feature guests.  A little more serious on this album and not as comical as his previous ones, it is a very strong album.  Has 2 or 3 songs that I skip and a few more classics on this one as well.  He gets on a few rappers on this one as well.  A must have rap album.      #2 - 9 (about White America)  #3 - 8.5  #4 - 9 (addressing his mom)  #5 - 7 (disses Canibus - good lyrics on this one but a horrible beat)  #7 - 10 (classic - great beat)  #8 - 9.5  #9 - 7.5 (f/ Obie Trice - about catching an STD)  #10 - 8 (upbeat song)  #12 - 10 (classic remake of an Aerosmith song)  #13 - 9 (Superman - talks about Mariah Carey and a few others on this one - great video as well)  #14 - 8 (Em sings on this one - for his daughter)  #16 - 9 (f/ D12)  #17 - 6.5 (f/ Dr. Dre - get on Jermaine Dupri)  #18 - 10 (classic f/ Nate Dogg - great beat)  #19 - 6.5    Marshall Mathers -- 10/17/72 -- St. Joseph, MO; moved to Detriot    check all my reviews
0393035158|5.0|My only complaint about this book is that I couldn't put the damn thing down until I had finished it! In brief, it is a passionate call for that human quality of common-sense before we see a 21st century Crusades destroy our world with WMD's. I have reservations about taking the moderates of all religions out of the equation too soon. This war wll not be won with bombs and bullets, because there will be no peace until rational folk of whatever beliefs sit down together in dialogue.Where neuroscience will take the author in spiritual exploration is a fascinating thought for a future book.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Will Ferrell was born to play this part, the film was written by Ferrell and former SNL writer Adam Mckay (who also directed. <br />I'm very excited to see 'Wake Up, Ron Burgundy' because I love Will Ferrell, Steve Carrell, and Paul Rudd and I love 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' i've seen 6 times at the theater, and I plan on owning these DVDs on their release date. 5 Stars the best comedy ever!
0767817478|3.0|Following the overblown, stupid, but fun \\"Independence Day\\"...director Roland Emmerich brings us the overblown, stupid but somewhat fun version of \\"Godzilla\\".  I'm a big fan of the classic rubber suited Godzilla movies (my collection is almost complete) so I knew going into this that it wouldn't top what Toho studios has done and is still doing.  My first gripe?  It doesn't look like Godzilla.  You could of course complain about the bad acting, not that Godzilla movies were ever known for acting anyway, but I'll take the badly dubbed japanese twins that summon Mothra over what Broderick and others bring to this flick anyday.  Also Emmerich films are known for overblown everything, sometimes acting.  Many times you see huge special effects and underacting in the same film.  I definitely feel that none of the main characters acted like someone facing a giant lizard destroying a city.  I just watched the film again last night and refreshed myself on some of the things I didn't like from acting to plot and of course I still don't like the way Godzilla looks (too Jurassic Park for me).  I think the whole Godzilla babies running wild in Madison Square Garden was just there to spread what should have been a 90 minute film to 2 hours (it also helped to \\"threaten\\" us with a sequel!).  Bottom line, if you like Emmerich's overblown, dumb but fun movies, you'll probably be ok with this (although I recommend \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" more).  If you're a hardcore Godzilla fan you'll probably range from disappointment to disgust.  I recommend checking out \\"Godzilla 2000\\".  A much better film with the classic rubber suited monster versus alien beings!  Special Effects out the wazoo and no long stretches where you're forced to keep your popcorn down watching Ferris Broderick & his dumb girlfriend rekindle their stupid relationship.  Who else thought Hank Azaria should've been squashed in the street, camera and all?
B0006399FS|4.0|What? Yes. Zooropa, as i've defined it- was a transition album for U2. Pop was the culmination of 6 years of electro-rock. Pop so happens to be one of my favorite U2 albums, because of its ingenuity, and lack of polish. HTDAAB is a transition album, and I don't mean that in a derogatory fashion. Zooropa is a great album, and so is HTDAAB. I believe this album is far more accessible than ATYCLB. The songs are real, with real stories, and thankfully not over-politisized. I'm not sure if we could stand a Bono waiving a white-flag anymore. Regardless. Vertigo is not indicative of the album, its fast, hard, and neat. From there the best two tracks on the album appear, \\"miracle drug\\", and \\"SYCMIOYO\\". Both are based in reality, with passion, which U2 never lacks. Their most experimental track since Pop is \\"love, peace or else\\". A conglomeration of tracks that may hint to where U2 is ultimately going. I find \\"city of blinding lights\\" as a set up for \\"all because of you\\"; i prefer the latter, even though \\"city\\" is a tight track. From here on in U2 keep a lid on the overtly \\"hola holas\\". \\"Crumbs from your table\\" reveals the heart of this album, its about death, relying upon others, faith, and hope. I think all of these themes are expressed well in the final four tracks. \\"One step closer\\" is a lanois-esc track with haunting lyrics of Bono's father. Who on death's bed- began to fear his lack of control in the end. We get swept along with \\"original of the species\\" (a great track)- to YHWY. A floating track that comes in and rushes us towards the end. Bono does't seem concerned about speaking the lord's name, making this the best closer to a U2 album since, \\"love is blindness\\".     The album has a sense of fear but becomes a U2 cliche, resulting in faith. There is no greater journey. HTDAAB is a worthy mention among Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. There are no weak tracks on the album, but ultimately their score reflects the standards that they've set for themselves, and they are high. U2 fans are loyal but reasonable- HTDAAB is on the plain of Zooropa. Some of our favorite tracks are on Zooropa, for stylistic reasons, and some of our favorite tracks are on HTDAAB, more so for their substance.
B0006399FS|5.0|I sincerely love this album.  I love all the songs on it and they're all tied together by this theme: with all the fear and horribleness in the world, how do you get past that?  It doesn't actually ask the question of course; it answers it.  Since the late 1940s, the \\"Atomic Bomb\\" has been the epitome of fear.  This album shows that, with love, one can conquer the aweful things in this world.  As other reviews say, on a more personal level, this is about Bono's father, \\"the Atomic Bob\\".  This is also true.  It's a great, personal album with a great message.  It contains the multiple levels of meaning of a great literary work, while pumping out some of the best music of U2's career.  I highly reccomend it.
B00000099Y|5.0|I love Tool. I read all the 1 star reviews and they're all from 11 year old Good Charlotte fans who have nothing to do on a Saturday night but to bash a great band. Unintellegent Nickelback fans. I hate Papa Roach fans too. And Linkin Park Fans. And Hoobastank fans. And Three Days Grace Fans. Tool is intellegent music for the Pink Floyd fan. I do agree they're a poor man's Sonic Youth though. People say they aren't subterranean. How often does MTV play a Tool video? Maybe Schism once a week at 4:26 AM. I would bash Simple Plan and Avril and stuff but I have a life.... wait no I don't.... If playing Mortal Kombat is a life then count me in. Plus, I don't stoop down to idiotical preteen's levels. Thses people ruined TV. I feel like doing what Pink Floyd did in the wall to my TV. Well see ya
0440238609|5.0|I read this book a few years ago, and I still remember the details of it. To those who think it is \\"atheist\\":  It is a fantasy book! I would say that children should be at least 11 years old to read this book (maybe 10 if they are really mature) because it is dark. The third book is the best, but beware, the ending is really sad.

B00005JN4F|5.0|I absolutely *LOVED* this movie!  Not because I am such a huge Jimmy Fallon fan, but because the plot was just so interesting!  This is a comedy for ALL AGES, and I highly recommend you go buy it!  Jimmy Fallon & Queen Latifah are hilarious and definitely steal the scene.

B0002XDODU|5.0|To everyone who's whining because this album isn't as hard growling stomping rock as their previous three-- to you, I give you singer Till Lindemann's advice, translated slightly because most of the whiners seem to speak english. <br /> <br />\\"If they want another Herzeleid, they should just listen to Herzeleid again.\\" <br /> <br />That said.  My objective opinion... <br /> <br />This album kicks ASS. <br /> <br />The R+ boys are playing with new instrumentation, new styles, and new subjects (it's a surprisingly topical album, what with the cannibal-scandal song Mein Teil, a love/hate song for America, and a rather enthusiastic ode to the -hem, hem- beauty of Moscow.)   <br /> <br />They loosened up enough to do Los, a gorgeous bluesy little thing you can shake your tail to.  Mellowed out a little to do Reise Reise, a song to get your blood pumping.  Got silly enough to write Amerika. <br /> <br />The drummer has left his almost militaristic straight-laced habits for a few nice, new beats that spice up the album.  There's a harmonica.  An accordian.  A symphony.   <br /> <br />And it manages not to be as pretentious as you'd think a rock album with a symphony would be.  It's still fresh and powerful. <br /> <br />The thing that's best to me is that Mr. Lindemann's finally opened those impressive pipes of his and really shown himself to be a fantastic singer.  It's not that I minded the growling, mind you, but if you listen to this album you'll hear what wasn't obvious on earlier albums, especially Herzeleid-- the man has a damn fine voice.   <br /> <br />Rammstein wanted change.  They got change.  It's damn good change.  And bugger the fans who don't like it.
0440180295|5.0|In his book, Slaughter House five, Vonnegut tells the story of a one Billy Pilgrim.  Billy has the unfortunate luck to be abducted by aliens, precisely Tralfamadorians, who inadvertently allow Billy begin traveling randomly through time.  As he moves his disjointed way though this book, Billy's life pans out, giving way to a colorful tale of a rather lost boy forced into the Second World War, and his life coping and surviving in a world unsuited to him.<br /><br />This is a novel of Great depth, hidden within a simplistic shell.  Billy's travels within his own life carve a picture of how the future can create the past.  Billy somehow manages to eek a past out of his own future, influencing the times he lives in.  While his influence seems almost nonexistent as the book progresses, a closer look shows how the slightest of nuances hiding in Billy's character can profoundly change the people around him.
B000002U9Y|4.0|I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, but it's been awhile since I've popped 'Saucerful' into the CD player.  Just the other day though, I did just that and I was blown away all over again.  After listening to the post-Dark Side Floyd too much it's somehow shocking to go back to the early, early days of their career and hear that that genius was already present on just their second full album. <br /> <br />'Suacerful' is the album in which Roger Waters first shows signs of things to come, taking over the main songwriting job.  \\"Let There Be More Light\\" and \\"Set the Controls\\" are easily the best songs on the album.  Syd Barret of course was fading fast and David Gilmour makes his mark as the replacement who would soon forge his own sound with the band.  Here, however, he sticks a little to Syd's 'Piper' sound.  Syd is still present, contributing \\"Jugband Blues\\" a song who's lyrics are very telling of how he felt at the time.  Rick Wright is no slouch either.  \\"Remember a Day\\" is an underestimated psychedelic classic.   <br /> <br />The album's centerpiece is the longform title song.  \\"Saucerful\\" is a build-up, starting off with quiet noises, leading to a more chaotic middle, and a great ending with a chorus of voices.  The band takes a huge leap forward from the masterpiece \\"Interstellar Overdrive.\\"  Not only can you see how they would evolve to \\"Echoes\\", but even this early on they were laying musical groundwork that bands such as Godspeed You Black Emperor are taking to great new heights more than thirty years later. <br /> <br />So for any Pink Floyd fan, this album is essential.  New fans should steer clear, picking up the albums from 'Dark Side' to 'The Wall' first.  I think this would be way too out there for you.  For the Floyd fan who finds himself overdosed on that period of the band this is perfect though.  Also, any fan of todays art rock giants should check this out to see how it all began (along with 'Atom Heart Mother' and 'Meddle').
0385336810|4.0|Emma Corrigan is a Junior Marketing Assistant for Panther Cola Company. She is a neurotic, but very sweet young lady.  While returning to London from Glasgow on a very bumpy plane ride, Emma becomes convinced that the plane is going to crash, and she begins sharing all her \\"deepest\\" secrets with the handsome American stranger in the next seat.  What kind of secrets does she share?  Things like....she pours orange juice in the spider plant of an obnoxious co-worker....she has lied about her weight to her boyfriend...little things like that.<br /><br />Emma is mortified when the handsome Yankee shows up at her office the following Monday morning, and even more shocked to learn that he is the CEO of her company!  But, the handsome CEO Jack Harper seems to be taking a special interest in Emma.  The situations with Emma's family and co-workers in the book are really funny, and most of us can relate to many of them.  Emma's flat-mates are very funny characters, too.<br /><br />This book was a quick, light read, but very enjoyable.  This was the first book I've read written by Sophie Kinsella, and I'm looking forward to going back and reading her Shopaholic stories.
B00005KARK|4.0|I loved this movie when I was younger. My mother say's that my favorite part was the pink elephants. Of course when I was a kid, I didnt understand the concept of drunkness. This will probably go over your child(rens) head.  <br />   Anyway, the movie is sad and yet an uplifting message about overcoming diversity and being all that you could be. Dont not allow your child to watch this for fear of \\"the wrong message\\" there are many positive aspects to this movie that you can go over with your child as you watch.
B00005AREQ|5.0|Amazing. This record is almost thirty years old, features ancient effects like the 'Talk Box' and an old raspy fuzztone, and contains none of the million-notes-per-second 'shredder' mentality that became so common in the post-Eddie music world. And yet I've never heard a more brilliant display of guitar genius in my life than what Jeff Beck delivers on 'Blow by Blow'. A bit more satisfying, in my opinion, than 'Wired', every song stands strongly on its own merits ('Thelonius', with its truly badass funk riff, is my personal favorite), with no 'filler' material whatsoever. The emotion and soul of his technique here is staggering. Any Beck-head in the world can tell you in detail why he ranks above his fellow Yardbirds alumni, but this is the record that makes a strong case as to why he's the best ever. A must have!

This album as<br /><br />a whole is just an incredible piece of work. I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />i'm usually not one who tries to know all the words to all the songs...but with this album, you just have too.<br /><br />it's that good. i'm not a professional critic...just a music<br /><br />lover.  So do yourself a big favor, and buy this album.
B00005ASOI|4.0|This movie is quite the oddity.  Italian director and crew, german setting, american leading lady, in english, with italian accents.   <br />Beautiful use of vivid primary color, especially red, and shadows make this film visually stunning.  <br />I really love how this film creates anxiety through the use of extreme close ups, lighting, and weird characters/costumes; <br />Miss Tanner's mouth and hair, the blind man's painstaking black/white outfit, the teachers' shoes, how red seems to seep into the frame, etc. <br />I would highly reccommend checking out this movie to anyone who is looking for an artistic and odd horror movie.   <br />Excellent, but not amazing.  Four of five stars.
B0006419J6|5.0|Anybody who didn't like this movie can take a flying leap off a cliff! I, Robot buries the Terminator, in my opinion, because it has the ability to make you care about the machines. I love the Isaac Asimov's books, and the movie was surprisingly loyal to the overall \\"feel\\" of the books. The soundtrack added a lot to the movie, and the robots (especially Sonny) were very entertaining. Will Smith was Will Smith, of course, but did his job well as the resentful detective. I definately recommend this movie to any SciFi nuts out there, like myself.
B000002GBD|4.0|I would give this album 5 stars, if I could just get more cowbell.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko's plot is based on scientific theory that has been around for years. But movies like this help people to understand what the scientists jitter about in their \\"requires a dictionary and a lot of drawings/maps\\" books. People easily embrace the theories after they get used to them. This movie is great, and the soundtrack is awesome! I loved Harvey From Hell, \\"Frank\\" the demonic bunny rabbit. Again, SciFi nuts should check it out. I hope they do a sequel focusing more on Parallel Universes; I could do with seven or eight Donnies!
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie is so good.  It is TEN times better than the book.  It has such good graphics, and the kids who play the roles rock.  The bonus features arent as good as I thought they would be, but thats ok.  Its made up for by an AWESOME movie!
068987474X|1.0|...and they probably brainwashed her first. (At least two women would have had the sense to stop this rag from going to press!) <br /> <br />This book is a bunch of anti-feminism propaganda GARBAGE! I was reading this at Barnes & Noble Saturday night with Mel, and I would like to restate that it is TRASH. \\"He's just not that into you if: He's not calling you, Not asking you out, Not having sex with you, etc etc etc\\" It is a step backwards in the female mindset, and it is telling women to sit back and submiss to men and their random whiles. While this is on the Top Ten bestseller list, I have NO CLUE, and women should not be filling their minds with this ludicrous filth. It is written primarily by a man (obviously), but is mysteriously enough co-authored by a woman. A woman! I suspect that she is way too passive to actually go for a man, so she is trying to 'get men off their lazy asses and ask women out, the way it should be' or that she hates the progress that women have made so she decided she had better rein them in. Or perhaps the man co-author forced her to do it because she doesn't have any muscles because it isn't feminine. I know nothing about this woman, except that she co-authored a book that advocates women lagging lightyears behind where we've progressed to.  <br /> <br />So, as a challenge to every woman that reads this site, if you are strong of will and mind, check out this book, but do NOT buy it, and challenge every single idea that it contains! ALL OF THEM! Call males, ask them out, grab their asses on the streets! For the men, read this as well, do NOT buy it, and do not believe a single word of it. Probably not even the authors' names. <br />
0140177396|1.0|Now, then:<br />  Of Mice and Men Is one of the worst books I have ever read.  Let me count the ways:<br />  1)  It has immeasuably two dimensional chacters.  Steinbeck stays so close to the archetypal \\"strong man\\"  \\"seedy guy\\"  \\"angry little guy\\"  \\"seductive wife\\" its disgusting.  he even has a token black guy!  Absurd.<br /><br />  2) An equally two-dimensional plot.  Steinbeck's unbearable heavy handedness in getting his all important \\"moral\\" across completely crushes out any vestige of meaningful charcterization or subtext.<br /><br />  3) The ending.  No, I'm not about to say \\"ew!\\"  What i will say is that thats what he WANTS you to think.  He wants you to put down this book and \\"realzie the impossibility the america dream, and the cutthroat nature of humans in general.\\"  The problem with this conclusion is the entire book is completely contrived!  The most absurd confluence of cicumstances that could possible occur come togethr in this book.  its all crap.<br /><br />There.  Just in case you missed it...[...]
B0006399FS|5.0|This is a great album. Yea, it is. I think the problem is that we are a little bit pampered by all the great stuff they have done before (Joshua Tree, War, Achtung Baby, Zooropa etc.). If HTDAAB was some release of some group we would give it 4 or 5 stars. It is not so common to record such album where all the songs are relevant.
B000002JSN|5.0|I don't really want to give this a five. (there's never a 4.99) It's not structured at all, and while most people will try to tell you that's what's great about it, this is _not_ the White Album. It does not have the relaxed recording feeling. The whole feel of the album is more like Coda than anything else. That is, a collection of rejects. Even if they are great songs, to say this is the album Led Zeppelin decided to take it all over the place is ridiculous. What holds this album together, in fact, is the consistent Led Zeppelin sound. <br /> <br />1 Custard Pie <br /> <br />The song is actually about cunnilingus, which makes it pretty disgusting, but that stolen blues line \\"Shake'm on down\\" I love.  <br /> <br />2 The Rover  <br /> <br />Catchy riff indeed.  <br /> <br />3 In My Time Of Dying <br /> <br />Really cool solo. Everyone kicks ass in this song. <br /> <br />4 Houses Of The Holy <br /> <br />Everyone's heard this no one, no doubt. Radio fav. Custard Pie, the Rover, and -this- reject title-track from Houses Of The Holy -are- this album. <br />  <br />5 Trampled Under Foot <br /> <br />This one can be kind of boring listened to alone, but it doesn't feel as out of place as some of the better stuff. <br /> <br />6 Kashmir <br /> <br />I can't say fairly how I feel about this one, because radio play's worn it out for me, but I don't mind going through it again. Robert considers this one Led's best; Jimmy has it tied with Stairway. Definitely poetry. <br />      <br />7 In The Light <br /> <br />Slow, slow start. But the happy ending is wonderful and worth it. <br /> <br />8 Bron-Yr-Aur  <br /> <br />Jimmy's best acoustic sound, save for maybe Swan Song. Not the same song as Led Zeppelin III's Bron-Y-Aur Stomp! <br /> <br />9 Down By The Seaside <br /> <br />Pretty lame. But true to the axiom repeated many times in these reviews that Led's worst is still better than most else. <br /> <br />10 Ten Years Gone <br /> <br />One of my favorites. Was actually manyideas that Jimmy couldn't use individually and he made of them this. Lot of interesting guitar overdubbed if you listen closely. <br /> <br />11 Night Flight <br /> <br />This is John Paul Jones; and it doesn't blow. Really nothing else to say about it. <br />   <br />12 Wanton Song <br /> <br />Boring and kind of ugly. The weakest track. <br /> <br />13 Boogie With Stu <br />14 Black Country Woman       <br />15. Sick Again   <br /> <br />Fun songs, but probably time-filler for most people. Although, Sick Again gets a lot of airtime for filler.
6305537321|5.0|This Blake Edward adaptation of Truman Capote's classic novella is ideally cast. New York playgirl Holly Golightly, played by Audrey Hepburn, puzzles a writer who moves into her building, played by George Peppard.     Holly has her life planned out. She plans to marry a rich man who is under 50 years of age. Her and the writer, Paul Harvak, start off being friends. And over the course of the movie, he falls in love with her. She of course has planned to run off and marry a man of means. Their relationship bounces back and forth, but is always leading to what we hope will be the inevitable ending. Here we have a romantic movie that moves from the cute to sweet.     This movie is extremely well cast, directed and scored. A most memorable song is Henry Mancini's \\"Moon River\\". Which is just perfect for this movie. And even until this day, there is not an actress that could possibly replace Audrey Hepburn. She is this movie, and it has to be her most stellar performance of all time. George Peppard is also very good as well. Worth watching.
B000063Y8F|5.0|There are garlic presses and then there is the Rosle. Renders plump, firm cloves of garlic into a juicy, pulverized mass with a satisfying crunch that could only come from the mind of an obsessed German industrial designer. As beautiful as it is functional, the stainless steel press crushes so well, there is little pulp left to clean. What remains is removed easily with a soft-bristled toothbrush and some dish soap. Expensive, but likely the last garlic press you'll ever need to buy.
B00000AFFF|5.0|While I love both Elvis and Burt I wasnt sure I'd like them together. I needn't have worried. There is great stuff on here. Great lyrics, singing, music, production. I cant praise this enough. Not a clunker on here. Is there more on the way? Hope so. If not, enjoy this for what it is. A wonderful collaboration between 2 musical artists.
B0006FFRW0|4.0|Sure. 5.1 lends itself very well to The Downward Spiral.  <br />It is worth it if you are curious. If you are just a normal fan and have the regular Downward Spiral; i wouldnt buy it. Its more for people who want a distinct surround-sound. <br /> <br />For the poster below complaining about PCM masters and Wave formats: <br /> <br />The fact that this wasnt mastered from 192khz files is not really going to effect anything. If the songs were truly remixed, and new EQ was printed to each track, then the it is possible the new mix could be from 48khz masters. Most protools files are PCM files anyway; so dont know what the gripe about that was... <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|I can honestly say I've never been biased when looking for good music.  But to hear some people calling this album the best U2 album and that U2 is the best band ever, it makes me mad.  I saw the video for the single \\"vertigo\\" before it even started playing on USA, some times they play this videos first in Latin America, don't know why.  Anyways it sounded so boring, the instruments sound so bland, the same cord over and over, boring singing and lirics: one,two,three,fourteen(WTF does that mean?). It sounds the same from beginning to end.  My cousin bought the album and I gave it a spin, and the whole thing sounded the same, boring, bland and generic pop rock.  People stop saying this is so great, when there are other bands that are creating far better music. One example of such a band is \\"The Mars Volta\\", U2 can't even dream of creating such amaizing music as the Volta guys create.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Slipknot sold out, became commercial, appearing in every metal/rock magazine writing soft songs about their life and x girlfriends. Songs playing on major radio stations. I loved when first slipknot cd came out, that cd blew me away, so aggresive and hard. Second album was bit dissapoing when they tried to do death metal and now this crap. Obviously Slipknot came together to put out lame as cd for some extra money in their pocket.  I dooubt SlipKnot will ever come out with a good cd like their self debut album. [...]
B00004Y6NV|4.0|Given my screen name, you might expect 5 stars, but it's just not quite there.<br /><br />First, the few negatives.  \\"The Bug,\\" \\"How Long,\\" \\"When It Comes To You,\\" and (don't kill me!) \\"Heavy Fuel\\" don't seem worthy of Straits, though they're fine for a lesser band.  I just can't imagine any of those songs, especially the first two, making the grade on the great trio of Communique, Making Movies, or Love Over Gold.  \\"Heavy Fuel\\" comes close and has super guitar, but the irony is too darn heavy-handed, especially compared with \\"Industrial Disease\\" or a bunch of songs from MK's last three solo albums (or even \\"Ticket to Heaven\\" two songs later!).<br /><br />Second: if Straits had recorded the live arrangements of these songs (I think 7 of them got regular play on the 91-92 tour) instead of the studio arrangements, the album would probably rank 5 stars, while maintaining the same length with a couple of songs cut.  \\"Elvis\\" and \\"On Every Street\\" are the two biggies that came to stunning life on stage, with MK's unfailingly innovative guitar work on the first and Paul Franklin's superb outro on pedal steel on the second (not to mention some of MK's best singing on that same song).  \\"Planet\\" also had a much better arrangement on stage, with an interesting jam between Phil Palmer and MK.<br /><br />BUT.  On Every Street is still a heck of an album.  There's a lot of wild stuff going on in the outro to \\"Calling Elvis,\\" very subtle, and they really sound like a band.  \\"On Every Street\\" is one of the best songs Knopfler has ever written--which is to say one of the best songs anyone's ever written--an unsentimental heartbreaker that again uses all the band's talents (Chris White's sax is used subtly and effectively instead of getting in the way).  \\"You and Your Friend\\" and \\"Fade to Black\\" could both benefit from another verse, but they match the song \\"Love Over Gold\\" in quality of writing and performance.<br /><br />IRON HAND.  Maybe Straits' most underrated song (okay, it's tied with \\"It Never Rains.\\")  An unsparing look at a British military crackdown on strikers.  Unforgettable, sickening imagery, but subtly and beautifully written.  Brilliant musicianship, with dobro or steel guitar or both.  Then come the two seemingly light-sarcastic songs.  I'm pretty rough on \\"Heavy Fuel,\\" but \\"Ticket\\" and \\"My Parties\\" work for me despite a couple of clunky lines.  \\"Ticket to Heaven\\" nails British televangelism (a different breed from the U.S. kind) absolutely dead-on, especially the self-satisfaction: \\"I can see what you're looking to find in the smile on my face.\\"  And \\"My Parties\\" nails L.A., where I was living at the time, even if MK didn't mean to.  Some really powerful stuff amidst the humor: \\"Don't talk to me about the polar bear...or the ozone layer/Ain't too much of anything these days, even the air/They're running out of rhinos, what do I care?\\"  Neither song rocks, but the music is in perfect keeping with the subject matter.<br /><br />So unless the Greatest Hits collections are the only thing you like about Dire Straits, I recommend you pick up this CD.  There's super, subtle guitar, singing, and lyrics on 80% of it, and the band--MK, Clark, Fletcher, and Illsley--sound smooth, all shining (one misses Withers or even Williams on drums, but that's a minor complaint).  Final note: I've heard both remasters, and while each does improve the sound a bit, the original sound was pretty darn good, so I wouldn't shell out more than a couple of bucks extra for either of them.  Good listening, \\"all the way to paradise\\"!, it's tied with \\"It Never Rains.\\")  An unsparing look at a British military crackdown on strikers.

B00005JMUL|5.0|This was a wonderful movie.  I won't write an entire page but if you have the opportunity to see it in an IMAX theatre do so.  You feel as if you are there riding on the train with them and feeling the snow fall.  IMAX is definitely the way to go and worth the few extra bucks!
B00004Z459|5.0|I'm a fan of both rap and rock... but combined, they sound terrible... but Linkin Park has mastered the rap-rock genre. Each song on Hybrid Theory is brilliant. They have so much meaning behind the lyrics, the beats are awesome, and for a first debut album, it's totally awesome! Between other CDs similar to this, such as Limp Biskit, etc., buy this album. You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />Ratings: <br /> <br />Papercut: 10 stars. awesome way to start off a cd. <br />One Step Closer: 10 stars. the beat is awesome and people can relate to the words... <br />With you: 8 stars <br />Points of Authority: 7 stars <br />Crawling: 10 stars. awesome beats.. and chester's screaming and singing is VERY good... <br />Runaway: 9 stars... pretty good <br />By Myself: 8 questions... makes you question yourself <br />In the End: 10000000 stars. brilliant. enough said. <br />A place for my head: 8 stars. Cool beats <br />Forgotten: 8 stars. good beats, as usual. <br />Cure for the itch: 9 stars. cool dj-ish effects. <br />Pushing me away: 6 stars. not the best song, but still good.
B000002KIK|4.0|I'll spare you the 7 page review (God help us) let's stick to the music, after all it's an Album not a book (right?) <br /> <br />The tunes on this Sabbath record are fairly accessible and quick to get into. It was the Sabbath album I listened to the least as a kid, however many years I had it in the collection.  <br /> <br />It was probably the recording that kept me listening to other Sabbath records. The recording is a bit thin and the drums are not tuned with any musicality to them, they just kind of sound like cardboard boxes of varying sizes... <br /> <br />Ozzy does some cool stuff but he's pretty much on his way out the door at this point and it shows. <br /> <br />That said this is still a really solid band playing really solid rock songs. That's getting hard to find these days. <br /> <br />This CD belongs in any collection of 70's rock fans

B00005JNEI|3.0|There is a scene in Romero's \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" where a group of elites argue over how to come come to terms with the problem of zombie masses, and the station is grabbing at ratings, even though there is presumably no one watching. The comparison between that film and anybody who felt the need to come to Amazon and voice their opinion on a documentary is much the same. If Moore's latest film is anything, it's a chance for everybody to pick a side and wage a \\"battle of who could care less\\". It does not matter who wins-it's just a nice chance to reaffirm the fact that you, unlike the masses of zombies in Romero's film, have the ability to think, and are the reason that anybody who is anybody would feel the need to bother creating such a documentary in the first place.
B00067BBQE|4.0|Evanescence live in Paris, they played most of the songs from the album \\"Fallen\\", and Evanescence used to means \\"Amy Lee + Ben Moody\\", and now Moody left and replaced by ex-Cold Terry Balsamo, Evanescence now sound more like a whole band and every members put efforts into songs that they changed some of the arrangements of songs, make songs feel a little bit different from the album version, which is good.  <br /> <br />Tracks like \\"Haunted\\", \\"Going Under\\" is difinitely great opening tracks, and they made Korn's \\"Thoughtless\\" sound great, too. and they stick \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"Tourniquet\\" into one song is really head-turning, but \\"Farther Away\\" and \\"Breathe No More\\" are not as great as those \\"Fallen\\" tracks, the melodies are weak on that two i'm afraid.  <br /> <br />as a live concert DVD, i'll be more happy if i can really see them play, but the music video kinda production/editing is not focus on the band, but the whole musical climax, which is not bad just i don't like it, i'd prefer focus more on each member in order to see more on how they really play their instruments. if you are familiar with their songs, but not familiar with their faces and gears, this DVD can't help..... if that's the case.  <br />
B00004RF98|5.0|Although polarisation can always be a dangerous thing, so too can having every person love something to the point where they will not accept an opinion to the contrary. And yet, this seems to be where vast amounts of people (myself included) stand. It seems hard to imagine anybody watching this film and not being able to enjoy it. There is nothing more that need be said, it seems unfair to spoil this magical experience by mentioning so much as one of the brilliant songs or scenes.
0792838068|5.0|This film is a masterpiece. It defines cinema in every way as being god-like. This is a warm one, a film full of overwhelming admirible quality. It is a drama with the tension of a horror film. It is a comedy with the hilarity of any Police Academy number ever made. It is a weepie with soul but still suitable for men. It is class. <br /> This film stars an actor who within his career was defined to no brainers like Con Air and The Rock but no doubt about it this film is an exception, in this he is excellent as the alcholic Ben Sanderson, who after being fired he decides to go to Viva Las Vegas to drink himself to death - Lovely... This actor is teamed up with Elisabeth Shue who also excels herself, she is the prostitute who decides to find love in the mild-mannered alcholic. She is perfect for the role as Sera, and after mishap after mishap after mishap, even one where she is raped by a gang of 'college jocks' (anal intercourse involved - yep that's how bad this film can be) she still tries to find her man. Yet the ending is sad as the actor dies and it therefore ends, it is quite unpredictable, you'd probably hope for him to go and beat the crap out the rapists. It is original therefore making it even more interesting. Oh.. and if you haven't figured it out by now the actor is Nicholas Cage and he proves in this film that he can act properly, he deserved his best actor oscar I think although he did have competiton from The Usual Suspects so I suppose he was lucky. But even with this competiton it deserves a five star for its superb acting, soundtrack (by sting) and for its simply manificent presence on screen. Hail to Mike Figgis
B0001611DI|4.0|This movie was released at what was perhaps the perfect time for it-1978/79. The mall was a reasonably new thing, and that is where this film seems to be most similar to...The Clash's \\"London Calling\\". You can practically hear the song \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\" throughout. The film is much more a comment on what the world would be like after a zombie invasion than a scare-fest. The world is one where rednecks and bikies run aroung shooting zombies and T.V. stations broadcast for no reason. Anyway, it's good.
B0006399FS|5.0|Personally, I think this is a better album than ATYCLB. Most of songs fit into an era / sound of a previous album. For example, Love and Peace would have fit right into Pop, City of Blinding Lights would have made the cut to Joshua Tree and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own has a similar feel to Achtung Baby. <br /> <br />Well most of the songs on the album are gems and the album is vintage U2. That's good enough for me.
B0006399FS|3.0|At it's best, this album is wonderful-Love and Peace or Else is a great bluesy soundscape that must stand as U2's best political song in over a decade. City of Blinding Lights is next and is equally good, proving to be another of U2's best. Unfortunately, these two greats (there are others, but it is these two that feel to be the most sonically diverse) cannot make up for the occasional lapses that bring the album down (the atrocity that is Yahweh), and although it certainly is good to see U2 truly sounding impassioned about something, there just is not passion enough to make this album anything more than above average-I would recommend it, because there are some inspired songs, but it's certainly not consistent enough to be regarded as a classic.
B0000844I8|5.0|This movie launched one of the best TV series of the last decade...Stargate SG-1.    The movie itself is done very well, with decent special effects and acting.  Suprisingly, the series has never strayed very far from this original pilot.  This is also one of the rare times when the pilot was good enough to have some staying power in the market.      This is definitely a movie you must own if you are a Sci-Fi fan.
0754023818|3.0|It is true that Bill Bryson is perhaps the type who would not always let the truth get in the way of a good story, and that not all of the facts in the book are entirely accurate, but overall you could not possibly say that this book is phenomenally bad. There are at least two segments that were hilarious, and Bryson keeps things entertaining. At its best the book could even be called brilliant-there's just something about the story of the two old people who emerge from the fog arguing only to wander off again. 3 stars.
0790731452|4.0|An excellent comedy that will be around for many years to come as a classic.  Everybody should have this in their DVD library. <br /> <br />The two characters that I loved were General Decker and General Casey.  My guess is they were modeled on Norman Schwartzkopf (the warrior) and Colin Powell (the politician).  <br /> <br />You will have to watch it several times to catch everything that was crammed into this movie.
B000006NPY|4.0|It seems impossible in retrospect to think that the talented members of Smahing Pumpkins could have made such a terrible album (Machina) after having made this masterwork. In a lot of ways it is their best-I don't mean in any strict sense, as in \\"must hear\\" or anything, because it is not that good, and it is unfortunately missing the wonderful drumming of Chamberlain that powered Siamese Dream. It is their best in a much more personal sense-it is the effort that truly felt as though Billy Corgan had come full-circle in his songwriting and themes. Just listen to \\"To Sheila\\" \\"Perfect\\" and particularly \\"For Martha\\" to hear just how far Corgan has come-the drumming and guitar bombast may have been replaced by techno beats and pianos, but that is really not the point-whether you feel unhappy about the new direction or not, there is no denying the wonderful songwriting showcased here.
B0000683DH|5.0|This movie stands alone as one that would have succeeded outside of the Star Trek world.  Ricardo Montalban does a fantastic job as Khan, even if you had not seen his performance in the original series. <br /> <br />This is basically the Moby Dick story in space.  If you are a fan of the original series, it's a lot of fun to see how the original crew has bonded over time. <br /> <br />No Sci-Fi library should be without this classic.
B0006399FS|5.0|I have been totally blown away by this album. Except for Boy and Actung Baby, this one grew on me almost immediatley. As catchy and cool a song Vertigo is, it is the lesser of all the songs on this wonderful album. Listening to Sometimes You Cant Make It On Your Own brought me to tears it is so beautiful. City of Blinding Lights and Crumbs from your Table are definately worth a listen. Two of the best lines come from Sometimes: \\"We fight all the time. Thats all right, Were the same soul\\" and also from Crumbs:\\"Where you live should not decide whether you live or whether you die.\\"  Dont pass this album up!!
B0000640SB|5.0|One of the better Sci-Fi/Comedy movies to come out in the last few years.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make a great team as the Men In Black, but Jones steals much of the show.  His dry humor is great. <br /> <br />I'm being picky, but I spent half the movie trying to figure out how the giant cockroach fit into the \\"Edgar suit\\".  It was a great concept, but I had a hard time suspending disbelief on that one. <br /> <br />A classic that will be around for a long time.  Should be part of every Sci-Fan's collection.
B0000029GA|5.0|Aight after throughouly listening to this album many times this is no doubt the best hiphop album i have heard. Study the lyrics and everything is on point with a superb flow on every song.As for peoples complaints with the beats, these beats go great with nas's flow and are an entertaining backdrop to his lyrical perfection.  I will admit when I first heard the hype on illmatic I downloaded it, took one quick listen, was unimpressed and called it overrated. However later, I took the time to listen again closely to every word and was blown away.  He depicts ghetto life struggles perfectly with perfect flow.  But even if you are not from poor background there is something in this cd everyone can relate to. Lol one person on here went so far to say that the mighty Shaq was better than Nas lol.  thats the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard.Nas vs. Shaq i wonder who would win that one.  Anyways this cd is no doubt a hiphop classic and will always be in rotation in my car.5 * no doubt
B000006IUQ|4.0|Although the plot was nothing new, it was filmed in a beautiful setting and used one of the best actors currently doing movies.  Anthony Hopkins does an excellent job in the role of eccentric billionaire, and Alec Baldwin is very believable as the back stabbing urbanite.  The bear is simply amazing.   <br /> <br />One of the better movies out there, and it will make you think \\"what would I do\\"? Well worth the purchase price.
0671015206|4.0|I thought this was and interesting and well written book. Many of the topics that were covered in this book were repetitive, but showed many good examples. It was interesting to me to find out that income doesn't determine one's economic status, but rather one's net worth is what really counts. I found that some millionaires got to be millionaires because of their budgetting and investing. Overall, interesting facts about economic status and common misconceptions about millionaires. Even though it was repetitive, it was interesting and had good examples.
B0000067X1|5.0|In answer to the echobats review and to anyone else who thinks this album is self-indulgence, I respond that it is pure creativity and you just don't get it.  My boyfriend put this CD on his Christmas wish list online along with several others.  By only listening to the samples I could tell that the CD would be great and different and yes, not like Radiohead.  But...let's be honest, Radiohead is good but there are many other bands out there that are so much better...maybe people looking for Radiohead should open up their minds and try something different instead of being spoon fed all the bad music on the radio.  I look foward to getting this CD, and if it wasn't for my live-in boyfriend I would buy two so I could have one also.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album will worm its way under your skin until you find yourself listening to it alone on a Thursday night, wondering if the way you're feeling is really what you're feeling, or if you're only feeling it because Damien's music makes you feel it.  It grows and matures with every listen.<br /><br />If you buy this album I would caution you against associating it with any particular person or relationship, as you'll have to put it away for good if that relationship ends.  Trust me on this one.  It's that potent.<br /><br />Damien is, frankly, not to be missed, even if he breaks your heart.
B00009V7T2|2.0|First of all, I came here to listen to this because some other reviewer said this is way better than u2. WEll here i am listenin to these people, and i think to myself, sometimes the song can be great, the lyrics can be the best, but one thing that really kills it, that is the voice. I heard the singers voice, and that guy sucks, talk about me singing better than that. The lyrics might be good, but come on, good music starts with the voice, thats where all the origins come from, instrumental and voice, not lyrical,  I can write poems just as good as these guys, but my voice is not better than bono's or martins' people please!!! distinguish what is good music and good lyrics!!!Peace
0920668372|4.0|I have to admit, when mom snuck into her grown up son's house I was abit skeptical...but in the end with a tear in my eye my overall thought of the book was \\"Wow!\\".  It's got a great focus on never-ending tradition and Love that simply tugs at your heart.
B00008RH1H|5.0|In this 1957 film directed by Akira Kurosawa, Lord Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) and Lord Miki (Akira Kubo) encounter a spirit in a maze-like forest that prophesies great things for the two comrades: the former will someday rule the imposing Spider's Web Castle and the latter will take his friend's position as commander of the First Fortress. Even beyond that, the spirit predicts that Miki's son will one day succeed Washizu as the master of Spider's Web Castle. Although the two men are initially reluctant to trust the spirit's words, preliminary parts of the prophecy come to pass, thus setting into motion a bloody chain of events that explores the differences between active and passive destiny. Lady Asaji (Isuzu Yamada), Washizu's scheming wife, prods her husband to seize the reigns of power at any cost. She insists that Washizu's only restraint is his own ambition and that heaven itself had preordained his rise. <br /> <br />Here, of course, is where the trouble begins. Asaji is initially convinced of the legitimacy of the spirit's words and points out to her husband that without his doing anything, part of the prophecy had come to pass. She then declares that Washizu must take the next step of killing the Great Lord in order to fulfill his destiny. And yet there is an obvious question that arises at this point...Miki's son, skeptical of the prospect of his succession to the throne of Spider's Web Castle, tells his father that the spirit's prophecy is only coming true because he and Washizu took it upon themselves to make it so; was it fate or was it a series of man-made coincidences? Asaji paradoxically takes both views as she becomes enraged at the thought of Miki's son and his posterity being the ones to benefit most from Washizu's deeds. Now discounting the inevitability of the spirit's words, Asaji demands that Washizu put an end to Miki and his son to clear the way for their own unborn child. Will Washizu trust the spirit and remain passive or will he actively take matters into his own hand? Will he succeed in rebuffing the spirit and shaping his own destiny or will he fail and fulfill the prophecy anyway? <br /> <br />The film itself is excellently done (it doesn't get much better than Mifune and Kurosawa working together) and as with most Criterion Collection DVDs, this one is filled with extras. My favorite feature is the two separate English-language subtitlings. The first is a bit more literary and not quite as literal (I'm so clever sometimes). The second is more conservative and stays closer to a truly accurate translation. Compare these sentences: \\"he has imbibed too freely\\" as opposed to \\"he has had too much wine.\\" Because this is a period drama, the first feels more appropriate to me, especially since the status-based honorifics of Japanese culture (-san, -sama, -dono, etc.) generally lend themselves to older modes of the English language when translating them. The more lyrical translation can be a bit much at times, however, so I can certainly understand why someone would be inclined to prefer the more accurate one. <br /> <br />Though I was not particularly enthusiastic about the price-tag of this film, I was satisfied with the results. Highly recommended to all those with a penchant for high quality cinema.
6305949980|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas, the classic masterpiece of claymation, returns triumphantly to our telivision sets with this Special Edition.   <br /> <br />The film, based off a poem by Tim Burton, is one of the more masterful, original musicals made for film in rececent years.  Danny Elfman brilliantly writes (and sings for Jack Skellington) memorable musical numbers, and the animation is so flawless, you find yourself forgetting that you are watching a movie of clay figurines. <br /> <br />Long story short, this film is a classic, and a must own for anyone.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This CD comes with Shania's very best hits and 3 all new songs. Songs from The Woman In Me, Come On Over and Up! are all on this cd. It's a wonderful gift to give to any Shania fan. The new songs \\"Party For Two,\\" \\"Don't,\\" and \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" are 3 good songs to add to your collection. <br /> <br />\\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" is a very upbeat song with a swing touch. This is one of my favorite new songs. <br /> <br />\\"Don't\\" is a slow but touching song. Shania has a way of telling stories through her songs, and this song tells a wonderful story. <br /> <br />\\"Party For Two\\" is another upbeat song. It's very playful and cute.
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />well, this album isn't good, really. I'm so sorry but I'm really dissapointing of this HTDAAB. This short album has nothing new and fresh, and Bono sounds horrible, making this LP his worst album performance ever !!!.  <br /> <br />Pop changed my life, it was an amazing musical journey ( really Larry ) and I felt in love with Pop at first sight, unlike this safe and almost ATYCLB bomb. Bono looks ugly, old and tired with his long hair and his little beard. The whole band sounds uninspired and boring, the songs are common and predictable, there is nothing exciting in this music, which repeats the ATYCLB design.  <br /> <br />PLEASE U2, STOP UNDERRATING AND HATING POP AND OVERRATING ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND, PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG IN POP, THERE'S SO MUCH WRONG IN ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND !!! <br /> <br />Thank You
B00064MW6A|3.0|I went to the theatre to watch Catwoman with low expectations.  Everything I heard surrounding this film was bad.  And it was very bad, but it was campy and entertaining in a good cheesy way.  I also don't think anyone should blame the failiure of Catwoman on Halle Berry, I think she was the only thing right about the movie and it made it entertaining for me to watch.  First why did they hire a first time director with the name of Pitof?  It is obvious that he doesn't know the direction the film is going in and the plot is paper thin at best.  The love story between Benjamin Bratt and Catwoman doesn't get off the ground at all.  Also I am suppose to believe their is some odd hippie like cat lady who convinves Patience that the cat choose her and gave her a \\"special gift.\\"  Oddly I thought Sharon Stone was a good campy cheesy villain.  In closing this movie was not well done, but I did enjoy watching Halle Berry purr as Catwoman and that is why I am giving this movie a generous review and might pick up the DVD!
B00006LLJ4|4.0|Set in 2054, after Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) and John Anderton (Tom Cruise) have developed a method of wiping out crime before it happens in the nation's capital, this sci-fi thriller shows us a world in which technology supersedes humanity and achieves almost divine importance. Integral to the pre-crime unit, which Anderton (Cruise) heads, are three \\"pre-cogs,\\" innocent survivors of genetic experimentation who see murders before they take place. The pre-cogs are maintained under laboratory conditions in the \\"Temple\\" beneath the high tech police headquarters, where their visions, which become holographic images, allow the pre-crime unit to arrest and imprison \\"pre-murderers.\\"<br /><br />With a national referendum pending on implementing the system nation-wide (and the usual political jockeying for power), Anderton suddenly finds himself set up and identified as a pre-murderer.

B000000OQF|3.0|The Synth-Pop movement of the 1980s started to come to a close as the second half of the decade began.   The movement away from Synth-Pop was definitely toward a more guitar-laden sound.   There were different degrees in which the guitar-laden sound began to penetrate the music landscape.   At the most basic level, grass-roots artists such as Bruce Springsteen, John Fogerty, and John Cougar Mellencamp were making a big mark.    \\"Arena\\" Rock bands were bands that weren't quite \\"Heavy Metal\\" were also making a mark.  These bands included Bon Jovi, Van Halen, Aerosmith, and Boston were also having big success.   As for Heavy Metal, this had always been a part of the 80s music landscape - even when Synth-Pop was the dominant genre.  This was evidenced by the success of the likes of AC/DC, Iron Maiden, and Def Leppard.     In some respects, Heavy Metal went into a mini slump in the mid 1980s, but the rise of the Arena Rock bands also helped Heavy Metal bands achieve late 80s success.   This time, Heavy Metal wouldn't be the ugly stepchild, but would be leading the revolution.    So when a band from the LA Music Scene named Guns N Roses bursted on the music scene in 1988, it shouldn't have been a big surprise.  Yet, nobody expected a debut album called \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" from a relatively unknown Heavy Metal band to sell 15 million copies.   But as loud as the music on this collection was as loud as the splash they made on the music world - big. <br /> <br />\\"Appetite For Destruction\\" was to the late 80s what \\"Back in Black\\" by AC/DC was in the early 80s - the monster Metal album.  \\"Back in Black\\" sold almost 20 million copies, but AC/DC was already established as a band.   Guns N Roses did it from the ground up. It was a long journey for \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" to reach the incredible success that it did in 1988.   The album was actually released in 1987 and slowly gained momentum in the music world - no doubt helped by the changes occurring on the 80s music scene.   However, GNR really started creating the music for \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" back in 1985 - which was part of that \\"down\\" year.   I don't think the Heavy Metal sound was any less creative that year - it's just that the public wasn't as receptive to it.  With the creative juices flowing, the band was able to put together \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" and music history was to be made. <br /> <br />There are three things that come to mind when I listen to \\"Appetite For Destruction\\".   The first is that this is a loud album.   The recording level is loud and when you pop this into your CD player, you will be able to crank it up.   It's very impressive how much sound comes out of these guys.   The second is that this album truly lives up to the \\"Explicit Lyrics\\" warning label that is on the case.  This is not to judge, but there a plenty of four letter words in the lyrics.   While this collection does have a lot to offer, parents should take note of this if they are letting a minor listen to this album.  The third thing is that I don't feel there is anything very much groundbreaking about this album.  I really think the 80s music landscape was just ready to embrace the \\"Bad Boys\\" of Rock and Roll.  Sure, \\"Back in Black\\" sold more albums - but \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" would have much more success on the pop singles chart. <br /> <br />When you listen to Guns N Roses - and in particular this album, one of the most unmistaken sounds is going to be the voice of Axl Rose.   Axl Rose has truly one of the unique voices in the music industry.   You will also hear the \\"loud\\" sound come from the guitarists - led by Slash along with Duff \\"Rose\\" McKagan and Izzy Stradlin, the guitars are truly going to give GNR their sound.  However, the most unsung hero of the group comes from Steven Adler on the drums.  It's Adler's drums that time and time again on \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" really stand out - especially on \\"Paradise City\\". <br /> <br />The hits from this album are well known.  \\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\" and \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" have become classic songs of the late 80s.  To me, \\"Paradise City\\" is as perfect a song as GNR as done - Axl Rose's vocals are right on the mark,  Izzy, Duff, and Slash are incredible on the guitars, and Adler's drums give this a thundering song.  These three songs appealed to the broader audience of the 80s music and would be a big reason why GNR had the success they did.  After these three songs, while there are some good songs - they aren't going to have as much appeal to the casual fan as the three classics above might.   The casual fan may have some interest in songs such \\"It's So Easy\\", \\"Out Ta Get Me\\", \\"Nightrain\\", \\"Mr Brownstone\\", and \\"My Michelle\\" - but I'm not sure if someone other than a more seasoned Heavy Metal fan is going to appreciate these songs.  The more these songs are listened to - the more these songs will be appreciated.  On a side note, while \\"My Michelle\\" has a heavy edge - it is a solid song lyrically.  I also think two of the last three songs on the collection \\"You're Crazy\\", \\"Anything Goes\\", and \\"Rocket Queen\\" are the weaker tracks. <br /> <br />All of the lyrics to all of the songs are included. There is an interesting illustration in the liner notes by Robert Williams entitled \\"Appetite For Destruction\\".   As mentioned above, beyond the \\"hits\\" on this album - this album may not have the lasting appeal one might expect.  This might explain the GNR follow-up \\"GNR Lies\\" not having the success of this debut album. However this collection is still worth checking out.
0790731894|5.0|Okay, it's Die-Hard-on-an-airplane the way _Speed_ is Die-Hard-on-a-bus, _Under Siege_ is Die-Hard-on-a-battleship, and _The Rock_ is Die-Hard-at-Alcatraz. But it's a fine action flick and it beats the heck out of _Air Force One_.<br /><br />I like Kurt Russell; to my mind he's never gotten the credit he deserves as an actor. And if (like me) you're not a big Steven Seagal fan, you'll be gratified to learn (about half an hour into the film) that he's _not_ the hero of the story.<br /><br />This film probably couldn't have been made today. In the post-9/11 world, every moviemaker is carefully shying away from the 'Arab terrorist' stereotype; the screen adaptation of Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_ substituted neo-Nazis, and even the Gubernator took the safe route (using Columbian drug lords in _Collateral Damage_). But in fact, this script does a pretty good job of making clear that the head terrorist (David Suchet) is a loon who doesn't represent even the views of his collaborators, let alone those of the larger Arab/Muslim world.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like a good action-suspense yarn, you'll like this one. Sure, parts of it are implausible, but less so than in lots of other good action films. And Russell makes an excellent hero.
B00006I53S|5.0|My photography falls mainly into two categories: outdoor photography of railroads, and typical around-the-house photos of my family.  This lens has become the one most often attached to my camera for both purposes. <br /> <br />At the wide end, 28mm is pretty good for indoor shots which aren't too close.  The zoom out to 135mm is a decent standard zoom and allows one to get closer to the action. <br /> <br />What sets this lens apart are the very quiet and fast USM motor for focusing, and the image stabilization features which are helpful when making handheld shots. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this lens as a must-have for any Canon photographer.
B0006284JQ|5.0|You can say whatever you want about Britney Spears, but she has come a long way.  She has been around since 1996, almost 10 years now.  An artist that can stay around that long is pretty impressive.  There's just something about her.  Even if you don't like her you have talked about her.  To create such hype all around the world is amazing.  Her music is so much different now than it was when she first started.  Baby One More time was a great song when it came out and it still is.  I'll admit that some of her songs were corny, but they are still fun to sing to.  Her newer songs such as Toxic and My prerogative are great to dance to.  If she wasn't around I wouldnt know what to dance to at the clubs.  I'm glad they added her unreleased song \\"I've Just Begun (having my fuN)\\"  I love that song.  It kind of reminds me of Michael or Janet jackson and makes me wanna dance all night.  Britney is amazing and will always be.  Buy this c.d. if you don't already have all her other ones... Hell, even if you do have all her c.d.'s buy this one too so you don't have to switch the c.d.s. to hear her best songs.  I would also reccommend buying her Greatest hits dvd.  Her music videos are so hot and she is a great dancer.  Mmm if I wasn't gay what i would do to her.
B0002TT0NW|3.0|By the standards of \\"Van Helsing\\" or \\"Phantom Menace\\" or most so-called blockbusters, \\"Prisoner\\" is an excellent movie. On its own merits, however, Alfonso Cuaron's take on the \\"Harry Potter\\" franchise leaves a lot to be desired. The first two films in the series have a timeless holiday classic feeling about them; I can imagine them being enjoyed by children in 2050. \\"Prisoner,\\" on the other hand, is going to look seriously dated in a decade or so. <br /> <br />The 'Potter' series, for those not yet familiar, chronicles the adventures of young Harry Potter, an orphaned boy who learns he has magical powers and attends a boarding school for wizards. <br /> <br />Cuaron made two odd directorial decisions. The first was to allow the young cast to spend much of their time in casual play clothes rather than in their robes and British school uniforms. Big mistake - they look like neighborhood kids waving wands in a park rather than gifted youngsters attending a school of magic. The second, stranger decision was to omit huge chunks of the book that actually moved the plot forward. We never learn, in the movie, how the mysterious Sirius Black escaped prison and the extent of his bond with young Harry Potter. We're also never given the chance to understand the dynamics in the friendship between Black, Professor Lupin, and Harry's late father. The new villains, the Nazgul-like Dementors, are appropriately chilling but - once more - aren't really explained. In their place is a silly, extended fight scene between a poorly animated werewolf and a griffin. <br /> <br />Perhaps the 'Potter' books are so popular that Cuaron believed he could skip over hugh chunks of the plot, knowing that his audience had already memorized every word. Peter Jackson nicely avoided this problem with his 'Lord of the Rings' films, as did del Toro with his 'Hellboy' movie. If you haven't read any 'Potter' books, you can enjoy this movie on a superficial level and appreciate the various chills and scaresCuaron provided for Harry Potter and his friends. As for me, I hope that the franchise's growing pains are over, and that \\"Harry Potter IV\\" will be a consistently better adaptation.
B00005JKHP|4.0|\\"Star Trek : The Motion Picture\\" was the first of the Star Trek films and hit the movie screens in 1979. Following on from the original series (and the subsequent cartoon), but set before any of the other spin-off series, it features the crew commanded by James T. Kirk.  <br /> <br />The film opens in 2271, with the five-year mission now complete. This has brought a number of changes to the ship and crew seen in the TV series. The Enterprise, nearing the end of a major refit, is now under the command of Captain Will Decker. Kirk is now an Admiral, and Starfleet's Chief of Operations, but neither Doctor McCoy nor Spock are on active duty. McCoy has retired from Starfleet, while Spock is on Vulcan taking part in the rite of Kolinahr. Scotty, however, remains the ship's Chief Engineer, while Sulu, Chekov and Uhura are joined on the bridge by a new officer - Lt Ilia. A Deltan who has - apparently - taken a vow of celibacy, Ilia seems to have had a previous relationship with Decker. (As a matter of interest, Will Riker and Deanna Troi from TNG were apparently based on Decker and Ilia). The approach of a very powerful entity called V'Ger, however, leads to a few more alterations. Kirk muscles his way back into command of his old ship, 'temporarily' demotes Decker to the position of Executive Officer and drafts his old buddy McCoy. Naturally, there's a full reunion when Spock (who'd sensed V'Ger's approach) hitches a ride. Starfleet initially don't know who or what V'Ger is : it'll be up to the Enterprise to discover that and find out what it wants. However, it is clear that V'Ger is very powerful and is on a direct course to Earth.  <br /> <br />This is a very likeable movie - but it's not without its flaws. For example, the Enterprise (which is undergoing a substantial refit) is the only ship in range to intercept V'Ger. As the movie opens, however, V'Ger is being tracked through Klingon space. This means the only thing between the Klingon Empire and Earth was a half-ready Enterprise - and the Klingons chose not to invade. Kirk himself was a little irritating at times - his insistence on telling his old buddies how much he needed them was a bit lame. What happened to the Captain who threw punches for fun and always got the girl ? McCoy doesn't help either - in fact, he makes things worse by constantly questioning Kirk's ability to command a starship. (Perhaps a \\"Loss of Mojo\\" is a recognised medical condition in the 23rd Century ?). Admittedly, McCoy's first appearance does inject some (probably) unintended humor. The beard ! The jumpsuit !! The mood-ring !!! Having said that Starfleet's new uniforms weren't much better. Overall, though, it's still well worth watching - anyone who enjoyed the series will enjoy the film.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|Always looking for a good crime drama, I came across this title at LackLuster Video last weekend. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption), Kevin Bacon (Apollo 13), Sean Penn (Dead Man Walking) and Marcia Gay Harden (Miller's Crossing) all appear in other films I really liked, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.    Basically I had two big problems with Mystic River. First of all, with the heavy Boston accents, it's quite difficult to comprehend some of the lines. But by far the bigger problem was the \\"coincidence\\" of two separate acts of malfeasance involving Robbin's and Penn's characters AT THE SAME TIME. Talk about your astronomical odds ! Even if I could buy into this extreme possibility, the reward at the end left me dissatisfied. I don't mind a little tragedy, but in this case it was totally senseless and the other character's reactions were also quite unbelievable. (I'd like to believe that Penn's character and his two slimy mobster friends were all arrested immediately after the parade at the end of the movie !)    My advice is to rent this DVD if you're a die hard fan of any of the main characters, as the acting really is good. As evidenced by the low price of this DVD, probably not too many people will want to keep it in their collection.

B00006WUWQ|4.0|It's hard to believe almost 10 years have gone by since we first saw Mike Myers' Austin Powers character for the first time. These are among the funniest films made at the close of the 20th Century. For the most part, they are chock full of sightgags and silly puns and give Mike Myers ample opportunity to wear funny costumes and try out as many joke accents as possible. Myers rises to the occassion each time out, eventually playing 4 characters at once ala Peter Sellers.  <br /> <br />As introduced in the first film (International Man of Mystery), Austin is swinging 60s' superspy who thinks he's a lot hipper than he really is. Think Sammy Davis Jr trapped in Davy Jones' body and you'll have an idea of what Austin is like before seeing him. Also introduced in the first film is Dr Evil (also played by Myers), a cross between Blofeld and Ed Sullivan. If anything, Dr. Evil has even better lines and gags than Austin himself. <br /> <br />The three films primarily spoof the James Bond series. The first film has strong overtones of both 'Diamonds are Forever' and 'Casino Royale' but Myers goes totally bonkers in the second film (Spy Who Shagged Me), in which 'Star Wars' and 'Moonraker' are yanked in for a well-deserved ribbing. The second film doesn't break as much ground as the first, but is arguably the funniest of the three as leading lady Heather Graham is the perfect partner in crime to Mike Myers' Austin character. Graham is the funniest of Austin's three leading ladies.  Unfortunately, the third film (Goldmember) declines after a very strong start, coming across as a stitched-together effort to wring the last bucks out of the Powers franchise. If the series has a flaw, it's that few of the characters seem drawn from life, rather than pieced together as parodies. <br /> <br />If you like one Austin Powers movie, you'll like all three to various degrees. At this price, this is a good time to replace your battered VHS copies with nice, fresh DVDs.

1869504917|4.0|This really is the only way to ever hope to find any of the film locations in NZ. Other guides & websites mention a few of the places, but this is the only book to collect all the info. in one place, & in a handy, travel-size book too. <br /> <br />However, Brodie's directions are often vague & incomplete. Maps would help, but simply including specifics like \\"drive 15km up the mountain & look for the DoC sign that says XYZ\\" would be just as useful. The current directions only say \\"drive up the road to the film location\\" or somesuch. This book really seems geared to people using GPS. <br /> <br />In NZ last week, I purchased the 'extended' version of this book, but I haven't had time to compare the text to see if it's been improved. However, the new version is a larger format, more of a coffee-table book, so it wouldn't be suitable to carrying on the road. Perhaps you could photocopy pages for traveling.

It was also great to hear a collection of music without electronics and just get into the great sounds.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is wonderful.  Period. <br />I knew pretty much nothing about it when I saw it, other than there was a guy named Frank, and my friend really liked it.  I was blown away.  I have seen it countless times since, and spent a long time analyzing it.  This movie is the perfect mix of funny, touching, beautiful, and very meaningful.  It is not at all scary, unless you are frightened by bunnies.   <br />If you like philosophical discussion, you will love this movie, but just because you don't does not mean you won't like it.  You'll probably love it anyway, and maybe you'll start to like philosophical discussion. <br />No matter what, this movie contains one of the funniest lines in the world: \\"He asked me to forcibly insert the lifeline exercise card into my anus!\\" <br />From the relationships within the family, to Frank's prophecy of doom, this is the perfect movie.  The director's cut contains several sweet, funny, and informative scenes that were cut from the original.  It also contains some more explanation for those who don't enjoy being completely confused.  I myself found it fun to try and figure things out on my own, but i still enjoyed this version which in no way spelled it out.
B00028HBKM|4.0|It is a magnificent visual story. It is also pretty intense and violent. Not unwarranted though - as the reality and horror of the time really emanates throughout the narrative. I think people do need to see this, experience this to further their understanding about religion and its purpose in our lives. And just sitting in a theater hearing people sobbing throughout was powerful in and of itself. <br /> <br />The historical aspect of it, would be difficult to argue because nobody knows for sure what happened. Solely taking biased words (gospels) of disciples and scribes telling it in their own way is a bit too narrow and naive. Also translating it to film lends to an almost-excessive sensationalization of fact. There exists tons of research about the historical period that contradicts most of the words/gospels in scripture (and a serious case can be made for over exaggeration). <br /> <br />The Roman leaders in this movie, I believe, were depicted as taking a neutral stance on the trial, with the crazy Caiphas and his crowd basically swaying their decisions to the crucifixion sentencing. I can understand the hesitation by the Jewish community regarding the matter afraid of it boiling over to anti-semitic sentiment. <br /> <br />However, coming from a Jewish background myself, I urge everyone to understand one thing about the time period. Judaism had many sects. The people responsible for the backlash against Yeshua were the equivalent of the Islamic Fundamentalists today (as opposed to the peaceful religion of Islam). Crazed, self-involved, arrogant and dangerous these people were. And taking LAW too literally. Religion is not meant to be read or practiced that way. Yeshua himself was Jewish.  His followers were Jewish.  His tormenters were Jewish (and Pagans).  Get the idea?  You might as well call it Politics. Fanatical Talmud followers took things over the edge. And their priests were corrupt, and self-interested who cared not for the simple and peaceful teachings of a supposed prophet, and someone who was stirring up the status-quo. Making a scene amongst the masses, if you will. They were more concerned with crowd control and the Passover celebration getting out of hand, than worried that one man would take over as leader of Jerusalem. <br /> <br />Again, remember that Yeshua himself was Jewish. As was Mary. As were his followers. His teachings were basic fundamental principles from the Torah mixed with slightly unorthodox mystical Judaism. The overly abused statement \\"He was betrayed by his own people\\" could not be more incorrect. Clumping all Jews into one group is wrong. It is like yelling at an Arab neighbor about 9-11. It is groundless and unjustifiable. Caiphas and his crew were clearly NOT Yeshua's people. <br /> <br />I am all over the place with this review because I am tired as I am writing this... I will stop now. Just open your minds and your hearts and enjoy the film for what it brings to the table. But please dont judge a whole group of innocent people based on the actions of a few misguided fools.
B00068NVI4|5.0|I was at this show and I can attest to the fact that is was Yes at their finest. They are every bit as good 35 years into it as they were at the beginning. The short acoustic set they did in the middle of the show was great and highlighted their musical abilities. Jon Anderson's voice still sounds like it did in the early days. I hope they will be around a few years more (many more I hope). I can't wait for the DVD to get here. If its half as good as the other DVDs Yes has done in the last few years, it should be a treat!

B000002BYD|5.0|PJ's career is for once going well enough for the members to be happy. And it sure as hell shows. Yield is almost the complete opposite of Ten (not that I dislike Ten) its astonishing to think its the same band. The mellow overtunes, calm vibes you get from so many of the songs is such a treat from PJ. Theres still the grooving rock PJ are famous for, but its such as pleasant change.<br /><br />PJ's albums allways start with a bang, and Yield is no exception, Brain Of J is great fun similar to the punk fused Go from Vs. Then the album takes a suprising turn into mellowville with the sensational Faithfull, which is probably my favourite on the album. It has such a great hook, wounderful simple guitar riffs and vocals, beatiful song. A glimps of the usual PJ is given in No Way, a great sinister song with an equally compelling riff. The most energetic song is easily Do The Evolution, very un-PJ, funny, rocking, groovy...just a great song.<br /><br />I wont mention all the album, you have to trust that this is one fine album. Possibly PJ's best, emphasize possibly.

But he eventually meets many people that wants to help him and that he makes friends with them. <br /> When we first come in on the story we find out what Chris was doing on his last time in a car. We find out that he has been hitchhiking all the way to Alaska and he is now making his last friend. Then we find out that he is going to live alone in this snowy place that he was going to be in until he dies. We also find out that he has been doing this adventure that he has wanted to do for 2 years. In the next chapter we have found out that Chris had died, but we don't know how and why he had chosen that place to be at. <br /> When we finally get to the chapter that has started his journey we don't know why he has wanted to do this or even how he had planned this. We so know that he was from and very good family and that he had a sister that had a very good relationship with him. Then we find out what he is doing and how he is trying to survive in this world. He had burned all his cash in his wallet and left all his possessions behind.  <br /> When you finally come to the end of the tragic book, we find that Chris had eaten a plant that has poison in it. Yet the plant looks like another type of plant that he had eaten and he was ok. At the end of the book he had died from starvation. They say that he had been unprepared and that he was not a very smart person to go into the wild with no supplies. <br /> I like that the way that Krakauer told the story that it was very suspenseful and that he had a lot of knowledge about the case and what Chris had done. I also liked that Chris a very adventurous kind a guy and that he had been trying to accomplish a goal that he wanted to have. Also the ironyin the book. How Chris wanted nothing to do with a man-made object, yet he lives in a bus. I think that Chris just wanted to be alone in the time that he had and that he had not known what he was trying to do was going to come out in the end as a death that could have not happened. <br />
B000687M48|1.0|This self-proclaiming vocalist Amy Lee ranks amongst my least favourite artists in the current world of popular music. When this band got some publicity for their last album I saw an interview with her on MTV, and she irritated me immensely with her laid back arrogance, strive to look like 'she doesn't give a damn' when in fact she really does. Her attempt to look hippie, scrappy, poor, when in fact she's rolling in money and has a rather posh English accent is horrid. She claims 'music is easy, it's just something I do' - f**k right off. What a terribly demeaning thing to say. There are countless bands out there trying to hit the big time, trying to get the lucky break, and you spring up with a comment like that. Please be quiet.<br /><br />If the previous release wasn't enough to destroy your well-being, and fill you to the brim with sincere repulse. Well, here you go. Enjoy this amazingly gifted musician who can produced `good' music in her sleep.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|What I don't know!  What are the aspect ratios of the discs in this set?  I believe KK1 was only previously released in Full-Frame 1.33:1 format.  And, the rest in Wide-Screen format!  So, is this just a re-release of the same?  Or, do we finally get all the movies in Wide-Screen?
078681859X|5.0|I don't have much to say here that hasn't already been said several times throughout the copious other reviews of this book you can find here at Amazon.com.  The book is fast-paced, funny, intelligent, and perhaps best of all, doesn't \\"dumb down\\" to kids.  There were words *I* had to loo, up in the dictionary, and I'm quite an erudite individual.  Well ... if I do say so myself. :-)  The footnotes during Bartimaeus's narration are a highlight of the book, and should by no means be skipped. <br /> <br />Much as I love the Harry Potter books--and I do love them--this world Jonathan Stroud has created seems, to me, to be a more believable what-if scenario about magic existing in our world.  (Okay, okay, hush you Pagans, I know, magic *does* exist in the real world, but you *know* what I mean!) <br /> <br />I eagerly await the second book in this trilogy.  And fear not--though the book is the first of a trilogy, the story is self-contained, with just enough loose ends dangling to whet your appetite for a future book but not so many that you feel frustrated.  It's a bit like the first Star Wars film in that way. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor: buy this book.  You won't regret it.
B000003TA4|5.0|KURT COBAIN is a genius - in life or death, period. I'm from the previous generation, just before his, and his music has had a profound impact on me, and no doubt, multitudes of my peers. This man's lyrical content reaches across the generations innocently, unsuspecting, unintentionally and unwillingly like nobody else ever will before him or beyond - his pain, happiness, downfalls, and triumphs are universally felt and understood. Those who come here to slam him and claim he didn't know how to play guitar are inhuman jealous maggots - KURT's emotional guitar playing perfectly relays his inner feelings and he got his point across, regardless! Kurt played his guitar from deep within his soul and sang his songs from his heart with a passion and sincerety more intense than a thousand pop-rock stars combined. There have been three documented impressive, impacting and profound cultural music explosions in music history which have influenced our social culture: Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and KURT COBAIN. Kurt Cobain unassumingly took matters beyond Top 40 lovesongs and pop/rock ditties by simply expressing the \\"realities\\" of the public and private world we live in - his expressive lyrics described modern humanity realistically. KURT COBAIN lives in the hearts, minds and souls of every human being who ever heard any of his recordings. GOD rest his soul, give him peace eternally!
0790750627|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest is by far his best film.  The production, screenwriting, and musical score made this classic what it is after 45 years.  This film has indeed deserves its coveted place among the American Film Institute's 100 all-time best films.<br /><br />The actors along with the plotline pulled the film off with flying colors.  However, Hitchcock uses the same cat and mouse espionage that he used in his earlier film, Saboteur,, which captured the fear and paranoia of World War II.  Despite that somewhat unoriginal film idea, Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint, James Mason, and Martin Landau were quite convincing in this thriller of a film full of suspense and intrigue.  And the romance between marketing advertising executive,Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant),  and stranger on the train, Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint) did not hurt the film at all. What would a Hitchcock film be without that tinge of femininity and Eve Marie Saint's glowing profile?<br /><br />This is one of those films where you're rooting for the \\"good guy\\" over the \\"bad guys\\".  Indeed, this film has political overtones of the Cold War and McCarthyism.  Could this be a film with nationalistic fervor?  Could this have been a film about US consumerism and the sinister USSR?  Possibly, but it's a \\"hot\\" picture amongst the \\"coldness\\" of the period.  It captures the American landscape with New York's metropolis, which includes the UN building.  In addition, the wheat fields of the Midwest to Mount Rushmore keeps you hanging at the edge of your seat; Cary Grant holds on to dear life both from a crazed-out cropdusting plane to the heads of Jefferson, T. Roosevelt, Lincoln,and Washington.<br /><br />This film is perfect for the movie buff or anyone who enjoys watching a well-crafted film.  Indeed, the 1950s had not been all about the neat fixings of suburbia and \\"Leave it to Beaver.\\" You had Alfred Hitchcock to draw you back to reality, but in sophisticated film form.<br /> <br />
B00004WLXZ|5.0|The film is amazing. The visual impact of it alone  - A lot of reviewers have made very good points about the film. It's power as a piece of propaganda and documentary is apparent. I think all Americans who aren't too ignorant of history to understand it should watch this.  <br />Many of the people of America just don't understand the dangers of nationalism. The people of Germany in the 30s were not evil - not at all. They were normal people who were facing some harsh times who were swept up in and manipulated into a nationalistic ferver by their government. It could happen here. See any paralells with today's america? Now the bogeyman is the \\"terrorists\\" not the Jewish people, but the techniques are the same. Fascism is fascism - and it's where we're headed. Give up your rights. C'mon, oh, those people we're torturing, they're not people, they're terrorists..Give up your rights, c'mon, we'll keep them safe for you. Don't you trust us? we'll keep you safe. We never lie, we're your government. We believe in good things like puppies and pie. We'll keep you safe...Here, move to this FEMA camp, you'll be safe..... <br /> <br />oh...uh..the film, yeah right. SO aside from seeing this as a peice of nazi propaganda, to actually see all of these nazis speak at their rally - it sends shivers down your spine - as a historical document, it's amazing. You'll be watching this and thinking \\"Gee, these people aren't actors...wow, those are real nazi SS stormtroopers...those are real brown shirts...\\" And the english subtitles are great, because they provide a context, not just what the people are saying, but they also tell you who they are, where they are....
0670033693|5.0|I read many pre-publication copies of novels, but this one stands out as a can't-put-it-down mystery. Craig Johnson's pacing, character development, humor, and description set The Cold Dish apart from most stories and mark Johnson as an author to watch. I hope he has the next Sheriff Walt Longmire story written. I'm ready and waiting. Of course, I'll have to reread The Cold Dish first.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I do not understand what character assassinations have to do with the quality of an album. With that said, I love this music. It is poppy, in a good way. I'm not sure why one would want to compare Britney to Christina (or vice versa). If you want to listen to someone that sounds like Christina, then go buy her album. If everyone sounded the same,it would be pretty boring listening to the radio. I wonder how the negative reviewers would have responded to fame at her age. Oh well!
B00005A0RI|4.0|Another chapter in Haden's love affair with the jazz of the post-war late 1940's.  This time with a distinct Latin/Cuban flavor.  The sound is thick and at times lush-a sound I associate with film-noire.  You can practically see gentlemen in expensive suits and fedora hats packing heat and glamorous women in lovely cocktail dresses drinking highballs and dancing before the orchestra late into the night.<br /><br />Haden has assembled his band and arranged the music with loving care.  You have to give him high marks for his devotion and vision.  The downside is one tune tends to blend into the next to the point that it all sounds like one 65-minute melody.  Plus there is the added sour note that I find this kind of music unintentionally depressing.  Others may not care for the prominence of the jazz violin in many of these cuts or the over use of muted brass instruments this music seems to call for.<br /><br />On the other hand, others may love the stylishness of the late 1940's as it calls forth pictures of classy tailoring, mature men and women, sophisticated romance and frank manners.  The musicianship is impeccable while rarely calling special attention to individual players.  Make no mistake; this music is very elegant and beautiful-belonging to a time lost and long ago.<br /><br />Some years ago, in a matter of six months, I had laid my father and grandparents to rest.  As I was driving home several weeks later, I suddenly realized that my parent's world--the world I had been born into--was gone.  The neighborhoods, the concerns and the daily ways of life had been replaced by more modern ones.  As the last of the \\"greatest generation\\" is slipping away from us, baby boomers are quietly gathering of pieces of their parents' lives and world.  They are just pieces-remnants of a moment we barely caught sight of.  This album is a small window on a very real world and a time lost long ago.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|I must say that I waited with great anticipation for the release of this dvd.  I was personally fortunate enough to see Maiden Live on the World Slavery Tour and Somewhere on Tour but missed the Di'anno era.  I love Paul Di'anno's voice and this dvd brings to the forefront how great he was live.  The Maiden Japan EP lets your hear how GREAT he was but this DVD lets you see him as well.  You can feel that in those early shows, Ruskin and Rainbow, that somebody was gonna get there a-- kicked.  The power was overwhelming.  But as Di'anno says \\"Bruce is the best lead singer Iron Maiden ever had\\", on the documentary Disc 2, so you also get to see early Dickinson as well.  How can you complain? you can't.  So sit back crank it up and enjoy! <br />Up the Irons!
B00007ELEL|5.0|One of the funniest films of the 90's, if not THE funniest. <br />Wish there were more extra's on the disc (deleted scene's, cast commentary etc...) but the film alone is a must have. <br />Every scene in this movie has a line that is guaranteed to make me laugh. <br />Jeff Bridges has made some great films over 30 years..... this must rank as one of the best.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|It is finally great to have your \\"Greatest Hits\\" album Shania. I love all the songs on this album and I am glad that I was able to get it for myself. Now I can listen to all the songs whenever I want to and I enjoy listen to all the new songs that you have added to this album.  <br />You did a wonderful job at putting this album together. I love all the songs you have ever done and I hope that you won't take very long to bring out your next album. <br /> <br />
B000002WPI|5.0|this album is truly a classic, worth every penny!  Each n' every single track is great.  Each member put forth a tremendous effort and you can certainly tell by the end result.<BR>totally recommmend for any hip hop head.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is the reigning queen of country. A few years back the Nashville purists said she didn't have the voice of a real artist so they doubted her ability to sing. HOW WRONG WERE THEY? She proved to all who doubted her WRONG! SHE toured for \\"The Woman In Me\\" and \\"Come On Over\\" in late 1998-1999 and ended up being the highest grossing tour of the 90s.Now 3 yrs after her break Shania came back to promote Up!. The result? Her Up! Live in Chicago special had the highest tv ratings anyone ever did see in years. She's the best live performer and has alot of fun on the stage. This DVD special proves that for all Shania fans and those non-Shania fans. She's an artist who has fun on the stage and really all that translates into body language with the fans. I luv her live performances b/c her voice just shines on the stage and i luv how she performs MAN! I FEEL LIKE A WOMAN! and UP! but the best song she does is the final song ROCK THIS COUNTRY! man she rocks the entire planet. If you dont have this DVD yet i insist you buy it..ITS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY
0393035158|5.0|At age 12, my mother had me, and my siblings still living at home, read the Sermon on the Mount every night for a month.  At the end of that month, I was inspired to read the entire  <br />Bible, twice.  There were a couple of things even within the benign \\"sermon on the mount\\" that I found somewhat incredible, such as being sent to hell for having called your brother a fool.  But what really totally squashed my childish faith in the Christian tradition was my reading the \\"Good Book.\\"  I started at Genesis and read straight through to the end of Revelation, and then, because it left me feeling stunned by what I had read, I read it again.  The Catholic church has always wisely banned the reading of the Bible for its own parishoners, and at 12, I discovered why.  A perusale of the entire text will pretty much wipe out the idea of a supreme being that is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent, and even more incredible, composed of three literally unbelievable beings.  Sam Harris has written a book that should destroy completely for any rational person who reads it, the rediculous and unprovable ideas that are behind all the world religeons and their \\"holy books.\\"  Sam's is a book worthy of the 21st century and rational readers.  Unfortunately, the world is awash in unrational religionists of all faiths, tho some are much more irrational than others.  Harris demonstrates exactly how dangerous are unprovable fundimentalist religious convictions in a world filled with hundreds of millions of religious fundimentalists - and atomic weapons.  Given the fact that a significant number of Americans seem more committed to Christion fundimentlist propositions than ever in my lifetime, and that fundimentlist power in the presence of Geo. W. Bush and a significant number of Republican congressmen and senators seems at its greatest peak at anytime in our history, it will be a tremendous surprise to me should we not fall into a religeous war with Islam in the next few years.  Given the current declining level of scientific and classical education in the US and the Islamic world, it would seem that we can only avoid such a disaster by some miraculous outbreak of reason - and like all miracles, this is very unlikely, unfortunately - in both the Islamic world and among America's equally nutty Christian fundamentalists.  So I suppose we should all just bow to the east and pray for a miracle.  :-)   William F Harrison
B0000AFQS0|5.0|When I bought this DVD, I only sorta liked The Who, having just one of their greatest hits CD's.  Before I mainly liked The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.  Now, The Who is DEFINATELY my favorite band, thanks largely to this DVD, and now I own ALL of their CD's plus several other DVD'S. But THIS DVD IS THE BEST.  I've watched it literally DOZENS of times.  The footage of the band in this DVD is AMAZING.  Watching Pete during \\"Sparks\\" is one of the most awesome sights ever.  Of course, all of the footage is great (although I would've included the Isle of Wight version of \\"Young Man Blues\\" instead) Curiously, the only complaint I have is there are NO songs from Quadrophenia (perhaps there wasn't any footage, I'm not sure)  Otherwise this gives a brilliant portrait of their spectacular career (up until the death of Moon anyway)  BUY THIS DVD AND CRANK THAT SUCKER LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0671027387|4.0|I almost stopped reading this book halfway through. For a thriller, Brown spent way too much time establishing has plot and his characters. He put in plenty of action, but until he finally got the story rolling somewhere around page 250, much of the action seemed contrived.<br /><br />I was impressed by all the details Brown worked in to make his political, scientific, and action scenes seem authentic. Impressed, but for the most part not swept away into a believable fictional world.<br /><br />Eventually Brown hooked me enough to read through to the end. My final impression is that Brown stirred all the ingredients of a good thriller into _Deception Point_, but that the dish never quite came together.<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome_; and _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_.
0385486804|3.0|<br /> The biography \\"Into the Wild\\" is about a young man by the name of Chris McCandless, who tries to live off land and separate himself from civilization.  He changed his name, disconnected himself from all government records and went hitchhiking into the wild.  \\"No longer would he answer to Chris McCandless; he was now Alexander Supertramp, master of his own destiny.\\"-(Into the Wild)  For Chris, his trip lasted two years but ended fatal up in Alaska Fairbanks. <br />       \\"Into the Wild\\" written by Jon Krakauer, a magazine and book author, he researched about McCandless, and then after writing the article on him decided to make it into a biography.  This is defiantly a book you should read if you like adventure.   I really liked reading \\"Into the Wild\\" because it was interesting to see what he did, and how he went about living his life on the road and in the wilderness from 1990-1992.  One of the things I thought was really strange, was that it seemed from the very beginning Chris knew he was going to die.  Throughout the book he made jesters to his friends and his sister that he might not be coming home.  In one instant, Chris wrote a friend telling his friend that if he didn't come home from Alaska, thank for being a great friend.  <br />      I love how the book describes little details about what happened to Chris McCandless, because I always have so many questions swirling around in my head when I read story like what Chris went though.  In \\"Into the Wild\\" there were short biographies about other people to connect what Chris might have been going through to what we do not know from the information gathered about him.  Some of the story's were really interesting such as a guy who went to live by himself out in the middle of nowhere but forgot to set a date for the helicopter to pick him back up.  Then in the end he died from that careless mistake. <br />      Along with enjoying some of the short non-fiction stories within the book, sometimes it bothered me that Jon Krakauer put so many of them in his book.  There were times in the book, I just wanted to read about Chris, not all the other stores.  Toward the middle of \\"Into the Wild\\" it is kind of slow but altogether the book is worth reading it gives you a different perspective and look to live. <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|If this movie stirred an interest to know more about christ then I strongly recomend the book \\"The Case for Christ\\".  This is a book written by a former Jurnalist for a prestigous paper.  He was an athiest and decieded to research the evidence for christ on his own.  What he discovered eventually led him to a belief in Christ as his Savoir.  The evidence is right here, and it is all verifiable and from genuine scholars.  If you think this is all BS, then reading won't hurt you.  If you are interseted, give it a try and see the evidence for yourself.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|Just look at this cast! The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air!  The Fly! And Tony Award Winner Harvey Fierstein! What more could we ask for? <br />This PG-13 sci-fi epic quells any critical acclaim \\"The Secret of Nimh\\" or \\"Poetic Justice\\" received.  The character development parallels along the lines of Liz Taylor's \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\"  Bill Pullman portrays an indecisive peacetime American president. Yet when faced with alien onslaught, he becomes the embodiment of the vigorous North Vietnamese Tet Offensive.  Philly native Will Smith and southern pretty boy Harry Connick Jr. partner up to prohibit further illegal immigration from E.T.  Also, Jeff Goldblum plays the uber-nerd New Yorker, who bears Matrix-style abilities to decipher binary code, becomes paramount in the conclusion of this picture. Lastly, my favorite character is the one dramatized by \\"Soul Food\\" hottie Vivica A. Fox.  Her underrated performance emoted the strength of a Mr. Miyagi crane kick, yet tendered the loving care of Sophia Loren's bosom, despite the fact that her character's primary profession is exotic dancing. <br />This DVD is misnomered as a Limited Edition. I believe in its Unlimited possibilities.
B0002DB0FO|4.0|Everwood, Colorado had never seen anyone like Andrew Brown before. A world-class surgeon featured in magazines and newspapers around the world, the good doctor lands in Everwood following a tragic turn of events in his life in New York, and from that point on, the small mountain town was never the same.<br /><br />In this show, now in the third season on The WB, Treat Williams stars as Dr. Andy Brown. After his wife dies in a car accident, Andy moves his children, teenager Ephram and younger Delia, to the tiny mountain town of Everwood, Colorado, mainly because he remembers his now-deceased wife mentioning the village once. As a doctor, Andy was amazing, but his parental skills were severly lacking. He had worked most of his life at his job, and the family almost came second. Now he realized it had to come first and it was a tough adjustment for both himself and his kids.<br /><br />Treat Williams is fantastic in the role of Dr. Brown. You almost believe that he is a world-class surgeon, who now practices free family medicine. But the best we see him at is in his relationship with his son, which features the backbone for the show, particularly in the first season.<br /><br />Ephram is played by the very talented Gregory Smith. He has the whole brooding teenager bit down perfectly. His anger toward his father is well documented throughout the season, but you also see that despite it all, he still cares about him. A talented piano player, the youngster tries to strike a balance in life with music, his father and school all major players in the balance.<br /><br />Emily VanKamp stars as Amy Abbott, the beautiful daughter of the town's 'other' doctor, Harold Abbott. She quickly becomes interested in Ephram, but for reasons that really have nothing to do with him, but more to do with his father. This first season served as a spring board for the Amy-Ephram arc that continues to this day.<br /><br />Debra Mooney is also great as Edna Harper, mother to Dr. Abbott and nurse to Dr. Brown. She comes across as exactly the type of person you might meet in a small mountain town. Her husband Irv, played by John Beasley, doesn't get as much screen time as he deserves, but he does serve as the narrator on the show. The narration on the final episode is probably one of the best on any television show in a long time.<br /><br />Vivien Cardone plays young Delia with the perfect amount of innocence needed for the part. She is more foregiving than her older brother, but also manages to find trouble of her own in many different ways.<br /><br />Chris Pratt had a smaller role in the first season than in season two. As Bright Abbott, Amy's brother, he served mainly as a protagonist to Ephram at the start, but his character made some great strides over the season and was a key part of season two.<br /><br />Tom Amandes plays Harold Abbott, certainly providing much of the comic relief of the show. He is a true family man, but very set in his ways, which leads to many interesting situations. While originally not pleased with Andy's arrival, he begins to see the newcomer as an asset as the season, and subsequent ones, moves on.<br /><br />This show deals with a lot of tough issues. The town certainly has its share of problems, but the arrival of Dr. Brown seems to bring some of them to the front for everyone to see. Heavy issues like drunk driving and abortion move through the town and the cast and writers do a great job of handling the situations.<br /><br />This show is recommended for anyone who likes a quality drama without much violence and with a focus on family issues.ly the type of person you might meet in a small mountain town.

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I'm a fan of the \\"King's\\" music as well as his amazing dancing moves. Is there another artist with such legendary style and coolness? The man is just BAD and I'll forever be in his corner despite all the haters that like to judge him and don't even know him. They don't wanna be startin' somethin'! I already have HIStory book 1 which I've treasured for years that has a lot of his greatest hits (30 tracks/2 discs) 13 of which aren't included in this set, but I'm also buying this boxed set because it offers such a complete collection including personal favorites I didnt yet have: dirty diana, smooth criminal, Jam, Blood on the dance floor, & you rock my world...even songs back from the Jacksons era. I just wish this was released in the superior SACD format instead. This is actually the first boxed set I've bought from any artist, fitting it's from the greatest. Keep your head up Mike, we still love you! woooo !
0385486804|1.0|This book was defiantly not one of my top ten favorites. I disliked the book with a passion. I don't know why exactly. I just hated the thought of Chris disserting his family like that. My family used to have problems and would end up with one of us disappearing, usually my older brother. I was worried sick. I know what Chris's sister felt like. It's not a good feeling. It made me angry when Chris kept leaving. He didn't care about others. All he cared about was getting away and staying away. I think he made a bad decision by going into the wild. It was a decision that cost him his life. I don't think it was worth the effort. He threw everything away.  <br />   It was good of him to donate the $25,000 in his savings account to OXFAM America, which was a charity dedicated to fighting hunger. It was kind of ironic how he donated the money to fight world hunger but yet died of hunger himself. I also didn't like how he left a perfectly good car behind.  <br /> He made a lot of friends on the way to Alaska though. But when they heard of him dieing, they were devastated. He caused pain to those that loved him. I thought it was very selfish of him to do that. He also wasn't prepared. He died of starvation but before that he ate a poisonous plant. I think he kind of didn't care if he died or not at first, but later on found the fear of death. I think he could have made it if he knew a little more about the wild. He was a city boy. I didn't expect him to live in the first place because of his background. He was very unprepared. I mean, his boots weren't even waterproof. <br /> Although he made his mistakes, he was a pretty smart, educated man. He did kill a moose, which was probably one of the hardest things to do on the trip. He could have made it if only he was more prepared.  <br />
0375507256|5.0|When David Mitchell burst upon the literary scene with his remarkable first novel, \\"Ghostwritten\\", it was clear that not only was he a great talent, but that he would redefine what constituted a novel.  With his fascinating interweaving of seemingly disparate tales he created a whole new view of the plotline.  With his follow-up, \\"Number9Dream\\" he moved in a different direction as he toyed with concepts of reality and time.  Now in his third novel, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" the reader is treated to a fusion of these elements as well as a more sophisticated layering of deeper themes. <br /> <br />In composition, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is at least superficially similar to \\"Ghostwritten\\" as, like the previous work, it is comprised of six largely disparate plotlines that nonetheless share subtle connections.  However, the similarities end there for several reasons.  The first is that each of the sub-stories in \\"Cloud Atlas\\" stands alone as a novella, whereas in \\"Ghostwritten\\" the different vignettes couldn't really be treated as discrete works.  Secondly, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" spans an enormous period of time, so the connections are far less tangible than they are in \\"Ghostwritten\\".  Finally, and most importantly, five of the six plotlines are chopped in half, so that the reader moves forward in time reading each halfway, then reading the entirety of the sixth, only to boomerang back through time to the eventual conclusion of the first piece. <br /> <br />If that sounds jarring or potentially confusing, it can be, but it is also necessary for the core focus of \\"Cloud Atlas\\", human progress, beliefs, and ultimately hope.  One has an expectation that as society advances it advances for the better, both in terms of human comfort and compassion.  However, Mitchell's cautionary writing reveals that \\"progress\\" is not easily defined, is not always for the best, but isn't entirely for the worst either.  From the nineteenth century South Pacific, to 1930's Belgium, to 1970's San Francisco to modern day England, to a 22nd or 23rd century Korean superpower and finally to a post-apocalyptic Hawaii of the distant future, Mitchell spins together a dizzying array of characters, themes and settings into this one overarching discussion. <br /> <br />As I mentioned above, it is perhaps most impressive that each section stands so successful on its own.  One might expect such an unorthodox book to be successful as a whole, but somewhat less polished when broken down into its constituent parts, but in the case of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" that is entirely untrue.  The tale of Adam Ewing reads exactly like a travelogue of the 1800's, replete with the style and worldview of the day.  Robert Frobisher's bleak post-World War I Belgium likewise captures the feel and literature of the day.  Luisa Rey's investigation into a 1970's nuclear power plant displays all of the noir-ish self-righteousness of post-Watergate fiction and Timothy Cavendish's misadventures beautifully sum up our rather self-absorbed era and the self created problems we bemoan.  However, it is the final two stories that are the most remarkable. <br /> <br />The first of these (the fifth overall) is \\"An Orison of Sonmi-451\\" which contains the first person recounting of the life and misadventures of a self-aware cloned servant in the Korean super-state.  Drawing heavily on Aldous Huxley and Philip K. Dick, Mitchell is able to explore some of the most powerful themes in science-fiction, while maintaining his own unique voice and perspective.  It is in this tale that the book's overarching theme of hope in the face of mankind's failings really begins to assert itself, all while offering a tale that is strongly reminiscent of Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" (a.k.a. \\"Blade Runner\\").  The second (the sixth, and only story told from start to finish) is the story of Zachry, who lives in a post-apocalyptic Hawaii of the distant future.  Clearly influenced by Russell Hoban's \\"Riddley Walker\\", Zachry recounts a life that is notall that different from that encountered by Adam Ewing in his journeys through the Pacific centuries before.  It is this symmetry that forms the foundation for the entire book, and which sets the tone for the second half of the book.  For in a world that seems destined to wind down, what is the point of resolution in all of the other plotlines? <br /> <br />Of course, that is what makes \\"Cloud Atlas\\" such a remarkable novel.  Because of Mitchell's presentation, he leaves open the question of whether time is malleable, or if there is but one path forward.  Perhaps the reversal in the book's second half indicates that the characters are changing their lives, and thus the future or it is possible that their actions echo through the past.  In a time when quantam physics seems to indicate that time is only a perception of entropy and that all \\"times\\" may be present at any given moment, the ramifications of Mitchell's approach are ultimately endless. <br /> <br />Somehow this open-ended interpretation seems appropriate for a book of such scope and ambition.  In \\"Cloud Atlas\\" David Mitchell continues to reshape what a novel is, and continues to challenge his readers even as he draws them in with deft writing and engaging plotlines.  Admittedly, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" can be a daunting novel to approach, but once the reader begins to pick up on the subtle connections and rhythms of the passing centuries, it is impossible to escape. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />
B000002AGN|5.0|I played Take Five to a mate of mine and he loved but then when I played the rest of the album he hated it and kept telling me to play Take Five again and again. What a wanker, well I suppose he does also listen to Linkin Park, Lost Prophets and Blink 182, lol.   Being 17 years young myself, I can certainly understand the popular appeal of Take Five, the deceptively simple piano chord structure and the infamous saxophone melody that it supports are enough to make anyone like this song, no matter if you're favourite musicians are Miles and the Mahavishnu Orchestra or you're a big smelly metaller who likes Pantera!!!! and Slayer!!!!!, and then, if you actually know anything about music, you will be automatically astounded by the complexity of the time signature (5/4 i think) and, more so, how Joe Morello can manage to do an already technically amazing drum solo and still manage to stay in time.    Blue Rodo A La Turk is my favourite song on the album, it features a (non-surprisingly) Turkish flavour and time signature (9/8) which explodes into an almost operatic crescendo before slowing down and reverting to 4/4 for more of Dave and Paul's lead improv.    I'm not gonna review each song individualy, although I should because each is so unique (so unique, that's a pleanasm, sorry) but I'll end by saying that you must buy this album, whoever you are, especially if you're my age - the more of you who do and let it grow and you and inspre to buy more good music the less young people with **** tastes in music will exist, those wankers who give us young people a bad name.    Also, the final track 'Pick Up Sticks' has, without question, THE coolest bassline imaginable, yes even cooler than that of Miles' [...] Brew (title track) or Coltrane's Ole, impossible as it may seem. Go on Dave you legend
B0000584V3|1.0|I am a huge fan of metal....I myself am an aspiring metal singer...thats right singer, not growler.  Opeth is a very musically talented band, but the growling has just got to stop at all costs, that just ruins everything.  Whoever decided that growling all the time sounds pleasurful to listen and requires talent (it takes little to none, and lets just see if those growlers can do that live when they're 50 years old) need to be shot and hung...listen to Rob Halford or Sebastian Bach, that is what a metal singer should sound like...growling is an absolutely and completely a joke and hopefully that \\"metal trend\\" will fade away asap.
B0006399FS|5.0|When I first listened to this album, it really dissapointed me. <br />But they are U2, the value of their music always shows up after you listen repeat and repeat. As an all time U2 fan, I promise this one is worth for four years wait! Buy It! You won't regret!
B000268QB2|5.0|I am unabashedly in love with this sentimentally fragile, vocally seduced, lyrically bruised and ethereally melodic debut by a young and promising English band called Keane. The trio uses the piano as their base instrument instead of the guitar, which in turn delivers this peculiarly balanced, outstanding piece of pure pop (real pop, not the crap put out by the common tarts on MTV.) They definitely have given us the pinot noir of 2004 hands down.  Tom Chaplin's voice sends the shivers down my spine, especially as he croons in She Has No Time, which is fast becoming one of my all time favorite tracks. His voice reminds me a bit of young Freddie Mercury's: passionate, warm and clear. I am addicted :-)  The production of this album is superb. Falsettos are evident in some songs, including my favorite, She Has No Time. I heard the band sounds even better live; the more reason to go see them in concert. YAY!  This album has no fillers. Each song is well written and beautifully sung. Major standouts are: Somewhere Only We Know, Bend and Break, Everybody's Changing, She Has No Time *I am getting the chills just thinking about it*, Sunshine, Untitled 1 and the breathtaking, Bedshaped.  I have been listening to this album non-stop for two weeks now. In the car, at the gym, at work, at home, it's always playing in my head. I foresee a very bright and successful future for this young band of three. I will definitely try to see them live, but till then, I will keep on listening to this masterpiece a while longer.  Looking for a refreshing, soothing, solid pop music? Look no further than Keane. It's given a soundtrack to my exceptionally cold winter and I am thankful for it :-)
B000006TRV|3.0|This is probably my least favorite work by my favorite band in the history of all mankind.  There was no jamming on this album whatsoever... no chance to get lost in the music.  To many people, Pink Floyd stopped being Pink when Waters left.  I thought think it was a blessing in disguise.  After he took off, we got Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell, which got back to the psychedlic, jamming \\"I listen to this after drinking a bottle of cough syrup\\" sound.  I think that if a Pink Floyd fan tells you that The Wall is their favorite ablum, they have completely missed the point.
B00020BVXI|1.0|Hollywood blockbusters just ain't what they used to be, but what is?  It should be no surprise then that the at-long-last big-screen story of Peter Parker and his alter ego would be a letdown.  Some of the special effects are as bad as those seen in \\"The Hulk,\\" and that's saying something.  What's worse, the filmmakers seem to have banked their film's success on those FX, with the plot of this 2-hour film otherwise as flimsy as, well, a spider's web, and with just as many holes.  Meanwhile Tobey Maguire goes through practically every scene with the exact same goofy, clueless expression on his very uninspiring face.  Kirsten Dunst does well as MJ, but Willem Dafoe, bless his heart, is laughably bad in the role of the Green Goblin.  His costume is even worse. <br /> <br />Spiderman 2?  I believe I'll pass.
B00005ATQF|5.0|I can't beleive they released this full screen version rather then 16:9.  Totally lame DVD -  But what a great movie!!!
B000068TPN|4.0|It is sadly clear that many of the negative reviews of this film are based on a lack of understanding of the history of the Vietnam War.  While this film does have its defects, it is correct in most of the particulars of the battle, and furthermore is fairly accurate concerning the qualities of the U.S. soldiers that fought in the Ia Drang valley in 1965. <br /> <br />The Army in 1965 was very different from the Army in 1968 or 1972.  The level of training of the troops was better, and their attitude towards the war was much more optimistic.  This reflected the public attitudes towards the Vietnam War in the United States in 1965, which were overwhelmingly pro-war.  The disillusionment with the war, the vehement anti-war protests, the discrediting of the Johnson administration, and the gradual decay of the Army's morale and combat ability were IN THE FUTURE.  The 1st Cavalry Division was a well-trained and well-disciplined unit, and while it contained plenty of draftees, their attitudes were generally very different than they were later in the war.  Remember that the public supported the war at this time, and their attitudes reflected the public attitudes.  Likewise, the problems with indiscipline, drug use, ticket-punching officers and the soldiers that fragged them, and so forth, DID NOT YET EXIST. <br /> <br />Most Vietnam War movies told the story of the latter parts of the war, when the public had turned against the war in general, and to a large extent against the military itself.  Drafting people into a war that was increasingly unpopular naturally lead to a decline in the fighting ability, discipline and morale of the military itself, with consequences that were sadly predictable.  This, however, was a different time, something that has to be understood as a historical fact when judging this film. <br /> <br />With this in mind, We Were Soldiers was not idealizing the attitudes of the people involved in the battle; it was simply a snapshot in time of a hard-fought battle that started (in the American mind, anyway) a war that was not yet considered unjust, being fought by an Army that was still held in high regard by the public at large... and maybe more importantly, by itself.  In this context, it is clear why many criticisms of this film are rather stupid, to put it mildly. <br /> <br />Thus, We Were Soldiers is quite historically accurate.  The soldiers were largely as they were portrayed in the film, and the battle largely unfolded as described in the movie.  The combat is depicted, rightly, as an awful and gruesome experience.  The behavior of the people involved is rather sentimental, but in truth soldiers who are bleeding to death tend to express simple sentiments, such as, \\"tell my wife I love her,\\" or \\"tell my parents I done good.\\"  The supremely cynical sort may scoff at this, but they do so in the comfort of a sissified lifestyle, and thus have no basis to judge that sort of thing.   Those who read the book, instead of simply talking out of their behinds, will recognize that some of the most seemingly absurd events are, in fact, true.  That would, however, require INFORMED criticism, instead of simply speaking from simplistic prejudices. <br /> <br />Having said all that, this film is not without its shortcomings.  It focuses excessive attention on the wives back at home, who ARE glorified to a rather silly degree.  Based on my experience in the military, a large proportion of the wives and girlfriends left behind were cheating on the deployed soldiers, or emptying out their bank accounts... a sad fact of life.  More significantly, I found these sequences to be rather boring, and served more as a distraction than as amplification.  The contrast with Black Hawk Down is significant.  In that film, director Ridley Scott did not give the audience a break at all; he simply showed the events largely as they unfolded in as direct and (accurately) brutal manner as possible.  I think it was a better, if less conventional, film for taking that course of action. <br /> <br />As a side note, those calling Black Hawk Down jingoistic must be utterly insane.  It is in many ways the most anti-war movie you will see, simply because it does the best job of showing how awful the actual combat was, and how futile the battle turned out to be for everyone involved.  I think some people won't be satisfied with a movie about the U.S. Army unless it consists entirely of soldiers eating babies alive.   <br /> <br />For the grown-ups out there, for the most part this is realistic movie for the period it is supposed to represent, and covers a portion of the Vietnam War largely ignored by Hollywood.  It is not the best war movie made, but is of high quality overall and worth watching.   <br />
0689862725|4.0|Pop-Up Book Version:<br /><br />This story, while often considered a work of juvenile fiction, is quite ageless.  It gets at that spongy heart of fear-- where the prospect of being completely lost in a world that has \\"teeth\\" that it can bite you with anytime it wants to is more than probable.  This pop-up book, like the story itself, is also ageless.  A wonderfully condensed and brilliantly illustrated book with scores of secret tabs to pull and pop-ups to explore.
B00005JMXX|4.0|Most of you have seen this or will want to see this for the gee-whiz CGI special effects. And that's exactly how this movie is for. Emmerich is the master of destruction in this movie. All you nay-sayers, this movie is called science fiction for a reason. There are truths to some explanations on how weather phenomena occur, such as temperate climate being dependant on the ocean currents. (and yes, there have been rare cases of hurricanes forming over land.) But for the most part, leave the hard science at home when watching this movie and it will be a more pleasurable experience. <br /> <br />The visual effects are spectacular. Even though the ideas of multiple twisters in LA or a tidal wave hitting NYC are ludicrous the movie did a decent job in making it more convincing. Nothing happens this quick in real life, but I don't think watching the air slowly chill for decades will have the same effect. The story seems like an afterthought; not great but not too horrible either. Some subplots and dialogue, like the one dealing with the kid with cancer, are unnecessary. Unfortunately by the halfway point Emmerich runs out of disaster ideas and focuses more on the plot and from here the movie drags on. I actually wouldn't have minded if the disaster scenes were drawn out more in other parts of the world. But at this point, the climatologist going on a long trek to find his son, against all odds, was a bit out there. Still, the action more than makes up for this. The ending wasn't predictable but it doesn't leave you with a bad taste like other sappy endings. It could've been worse, like NASA suddenly inventing some wonder-machine to reverse the weather. <br /> <br />The movie has a message on how we should be careful with our resources but at the same time the over-the-top weather disasters may confuse the more ignorant people. But what really happens after global warming begins (besides the obvious)? Most of the scenarios predicted are pure speculation and we're only basing it against past models of climate change. The events in this movie are best taken as a 'what if' mash-up of all these theories.
B00005N9CV|3.0|While Ms. Krall has a pleasant enough voice, her interpretations of classic jazz songs are flat and uninspiring.  I listened to this cd once and felt nothing, then thought I'd give it another chance.  Nothing.  It's bland, soulless, white-bread music.  More easy listening than jazz, really.  Ms. Krall is definitely an attractive woman and I'm sure that will help sustain her career.  Personally, I prefer my jazz with a lot more guts.
B00067BBQE|5.0|This is truely the best live concert I've seen in my life.  Amy Lee and the band are absolutely amazing onstage.  Finally, a female performer who doesn't lipsync all of her songs!  And as if the concert wasn't great enough, all the behind-the-scenes stuff is hilarious!  I can honestly say I'm a bigger fan now than I was before seeing them live.  This is definitely a must have for any Evanescence fan.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am a long time U2 fan, and although this is not their best album it is still a great album.  Especially when you compare it to the crap that is being put out right now.  Bono's voice is always amazing and far surpasses anyone else's voice.  The edge Rocks on this album and the classic U2 sound is prevalent in many tracks...Sure there may be no ONE on this album but MIRACLE DRUG is still a pretty great song. <br />I have to agree with another reviewer that this album takes listening to it a couple of times to truly appreciate it.  But all great albums do, except for the mindless pop that is being pushed right now.
B00068IOWM|4.0|Not as of the same caliber as Achtung Baby, HTDAAB is a balance of Edge's hard riffs and solos along side Bono's deep slower tracks. This is NOT a disappointment at all, well worth the wait and money. If you're fan, screw the downloads and support the biggest band in the world for their unforgettable music.<br />After 2 spins of the CD, I try and replay the tracks in my head, but it's not enough; I crave to hear the music again!<br />And I'm quite confident that the tour will be an even bigger success.
B000687M48|5.0|Well, I lied in my review of Fallen. THIS CD is the best CD I've ever listened to. It displays just how much talent Amy and the rest of the band have. They sing BETTER live than they do on their studio album. I saw them live this past summer, and they freakin' rocked. This CD brought me right back to the concert. If you haven't seen them live, I can see where you'd get kind of annoyed by all the cheering, but if you have, it just makes the CD that much better. The first song \\"Haunted\\" gave me goosebumps. They drag out the opening to make it dramatic, and it definitely works! There are three new songs not on Fallen, and they're all great of coarse. \\"Farther Away\\" is a classic head-banger, \\"Thoughtless\\" is an outstanding cover by Korn, and \\"Breathe No More\\" is Ev's best slow song yet in my opinion (NOT \\"My Immortal\\"!!). The DVD is awesome too. The behind-the scenes showed me a lighter side of the band I hadn't seen before. It shows them goofing around and having a good time, and even in some serious moments. The live shot of the concert is sweet; I like all the special effects and zoom-ins and outs. And of course, the music videos are awesome too. If you're an Ev fan, don't miss out on this!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is, by far, the funniest movie I have ever seen. I think I laughed continually from start to finish. The curious thing is that I wasn't able to figure out what era this film is supposed to take place in. It reminds me of my junior high experience in the mid-80s. The characters are so pathetic, but genuine.  Through humor, the characters achieve the unexpected: they suffer, but somehow overcome the banal and cruel events of their environment. If you can't relate, you won't find this movie very entertaining.
0897500482|5.0|Most readers already know that Bruce Lee was an innovative, highly accomplished martial artist who happened to be a famous actor as well. This book was, in large part, self therapeutic, written to pass along his philosophy and techniques while he recovered from a serious back injury. It truly captures the spirit of his art form, Jeet Kune Do. The text begins philosophically, covering Zen and the facets of Jeet Kune Do, then moves into basics such as warm-ups and basic postures, followed by more depth on the kicking, striking, and grappling aspects of the art.<br /><br />Whether you are a practitioner of Jeet Kun Do or not, there are large sections on attacks, feints, parries, distance, footwork, and evasiveness, all topics that transcend any individual art form. The concepts of power, endurance, balance, speed, timing, and attitude are universal as well. It is an interesting blend of philosophy and practicality that can benefit most any martial practitioner. Though it was originally published more than 30 years ago, it remains as relevant and useful today as it was at its inception. Your martial arts library is simply not complete without it.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction
038551123X|1.0|dexter is one of the most unbelievable ideas ever developed and shows how hard up the publishers are for new material.  it is so stupid that even matt damon wouldn't star in it.  there is no plot, no seriously believable characters, numerous plot tangle ups, and a fabulously poor ending.  i mean, can you really think that a scientist for the cops does cut up murders on the side, and no one suspects?? and that his sister also a cop just looks the other way??  this is total crap and most likely will never even wind up in a low grade comic book. <br /> <br />david g sutliff
B00030590I|3.0|I can go on and on about the greatness of this film. The colors, cinematography and moving performances are some of the most graceful and impressive examples of Wuxia I've ever had the pleasure to watch. I won't say anything beyond that though, because plenty here already have expressed it better than I could. Read the many the five-star reviews of \\"Hero\\", and believe them to be true. They are. Hero is a brilliant piece of wuxia cinema, artistic, stylish, well performed, well written and very well directed. [...]    This movie could have been released, and people would have gone to see it without Mr. \\"Cinema of Cool\\" attempting to take credit for something he had absolutely nothing to do with. If you think Quentin Tarantino had ANYTHING to do with the creation of \\"Hero\\" consider yourself fleeced, because you were. I bought the Chinese import from eBay well before it was prepared for release in the USA, and well before it occurred to Miramax to give QT credit for this move.     It offends me personally that Quentin Tarantino would dare to stamp his name all over this as if he himself worked on it. He did nothing but put his name on it. I've been seeing reviews (not just here but everywhere online) by people who think he directed it because it says \\"Quentin Tarantino Presents\\"! He did NOT direct this damnit! Zhang Yimou did. He did NOT write it, produce it, film it, perform in it (and thank God for that) or do anything but like it as much as most of us do. All he did was \\"present it\\" and what the hell does that mean? Nothing!     Why, Mirimax, did his name need to be stamped all over someone else's work? He IS a brilliant stand-alone creative element in cinema- invoking his name to fill theaters is despicable! And Tarantino himself is a piece of work for DARING to take any form of credit for this great film. What's next? \\"Quentin Tarantino Presents \\"Braveheart\\" or how about Quentin Tarantino presents \\"Ben Hur\\" It's (beep)ing pathetic.    It must be some kind of mean joke to play on the real creative people behind this, but those of us who see through this marketing scam aren't laughing, nor is anyone else.[...]     I'm probably shouting at the rain, but I'm going to appeal to consumers that if you saw this in a theater and loved it--- make a statement and buy the Chinese import of this movie. Miramax and Quentin Tarantino are trying to fool you into thinking this is another great work of the so-called indie-maverick. It's not only a crude scam to pull on the public, but a rip-off of Quentin's fans (which I counted myself among until this). Shame on you Quentin-your work is beyond is great, but you are a sell-out and a liar.

B0002VYQ2U|5.0|This re-release is very good, some people may say that it is not worth enoght to buy but I think that every re-release is for the fans or people who really likes the original version. <br />The difference between this Deluxe edition with the original are 3 bonus tracks and a bonus DVD with the videos of \\"SUNRISE\\" and \\"WHAT AM I TO YOU\\", live versions of \\"IN THE MORNING\\", \\"THE LONG WAY HOME\\", \\"CREEPING IN\\" and \\"SHE\\" which doesn't appear on this cd or in her first one. This live videos were taken on her show in Barcelona. Finally you get a 20 minute interview of Norah. <br />\\"FEELS LIKE HOME\\" is a great album as Norah's first, \\"COME AWAY WITH ME\\". Her music is very relaxed and her lyrics are very good also. This album contains a duet with Dolly Parton. The song leaves a bit behind Norah's jazz/pop music to a country style. Very good actually. Check the tracks \\"THOSE SWEET WORDS\\", \\"SUNRISE\\", \\"WHAT AM I TO YOU\\", \\"TOES\\" and \\"BE HERE TO LOVE ME\\".
B0006399FS|4.0|it doesn't grab you immediately like all that you can't leave behind.but it takes a few spins to truly begin to appreciate this album.for me the best thing about this album is the sound,sonically this is huge,it is as they said to the edge go cut loose and have some fun because man he is rocking,not just on guitar,there are some great keyboards on this too.for me the album was worth buying just for the track 'SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN'alone.beautiful.

This song actually shows Blink had a mature side while recording this album.  Very good, but not like most blink songs.  8/10 <br /> <br />8. All The Small Things <br />The MTV smash single.  I liked this the first 100000 times and I'm glad it's no longer being overplayed on the radio.  8/10. <br /> <br />9.

Cool To Hate   <br />I feel the way Dexter does sometimes when I'm in a REALLY bad mood, plus the song's entertaining. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. Leave It Behind   <br />One of my favorite songs on this album! 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Gone Away   <br />A slower song than alot of the songs on this album, but hey, it's still quite good. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />8. I Choose   <br />My definate favorite song on the album!  I give it 11/10... <br /> <br />9. Intermission   <br />A comical fake intermission...Disclaimer was better though.  7/10 <br /> <br />10. All I Want   <br />VERY fast!  I loved this one!  9/10 <br /> <br />11. Way Down The Line   <br />My 3rd favorite song on the album... 10/10 <br /> <br />12. Don't Pick It Up   <br />Very entertaining song, love the beat.  9/10 <br /> <br />13. Amazed   <br />Not one of my favorites, but still quite good.  8/10 <br /> <br />14. Change The World   <br />The longest song on the album.  Great closing track (plus if you wait long enough, a woman says \\"You guys shoulda tried heavy metal!  Kiss my ass, haha!\\" Funny.) 10/10 <br /> <br />So, overall this album is worth every penny.  Get it.  Now!  NOW I TELL YOU...
068987474X|4.0|WOW!  This book is so awesome.  Yes there are many things in this book I already knew, but somehow hearing them from a Guy cemented them as truths.  My favorite lines in the book were \\"Don't waste the Pretty\\" and \\"Put down the [...]\\".  This was a fun and easy read.  I will be buying it for all of my confused girl friends who are still wasting their time.  Transforming truths and tough facts put in a funny and encouraging way!  Go get it!  When you are done reading this book you won't be wasting the pretty anymore.  Thanks Greg, you gave me the big brother advise I could have used years ago.    Single and loving it in Reno,  Airaka
B00000AFWZ|5.0|If you remember The Real Don Steele and the introduction of,  \\"Boss Radio\\" in Southern California, this collection is a must have. <br /> <br />I've read some of the other 91 reviews here and I'm glad there are music fans everywhere who appreciate this collection. <br /> <br />If you weren't there, it's hard to explain this selection of tracks. If you remember radio in 1965, you probably remember when some DJ in your market upset the program director by playing The Standells, or Count Five right after a lovely Perry Como number.   <br /> <br />But if you were in Southern California, at the birth of top 40 radio in Los Angeles (May, 1965) you remember hearing all this great music on the air in one of the hottest combinations of radio programming, real live disc jockeys, and raw musical power ever put on radio. No doubt you pulverized the frayed edges of the speaker cone in your Rambler when \\"Psychotic Reaction\\" hit the air (and was inevitably followed by a jinlge!).  This is the music that brought AM radio to suburban kids cruising on Van Nuys, or heading home from the Rincon. <br /> <br />Too bad it ain't on vinyl! <br /> <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B000002U8G|5.0|There's obviously been enough said about the songs themselves amidst all these reviews, and it goes without saying that \\"Meddle\\" is truly an awesome album.  I wanted to take this space to nominate David Gilmour as one of the all-time great, consummate musical voices on Earth.  \\"Echoes\\" exhibits his visionary abilities as well as anything else he's ever produced.  First, there's the \\"Shine On...\\"-like introduction, bringing to mind barren landscapes of ancient ruins, followed by the rollicking guitar solos that sound like ever-falling and rising dimensions of time and space, then a strange floating soundscape that seems to remove the aforementioned scene from Earth to the surface of Venus, where creatures straight out of H.P Lovecraft howl and swoon, all courtesy of whammy bars, volume swells, a metal slide and minimal effects, topped off by the cool-a** multi-tracked guitar orchestra that brings us back to the song proper.  David Gilmour is a true musical genius.  Bow down before him.   Check out \\"Live @ Pompeii\\" to see how effortlessly and brilliantly the Floyd can pull this kind of stuff off.
B0000039PW|5.0|Ready To Die (Also with Southernplayasticallidacmuzik, Illmatic, Above The Rim soundtrack) was the best cds in 1994. Biggie's flow is so nice on this cd. I like the appearance by method man. My favorite tracks on this cd \\"Gimme The Loot\\" and \\"Warning\\".  <br /> <br />R.I.P B.I.G.
1400032717|4.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is a wonderful story, very original, simply presented, and easy to read.  It is one of the best portrayals of an issue that haunts many autistic people - an underlying brilliance that is completely overwhelmed by an inability to communicate with other human beings.
B00005JMJG|4.0|So you want to make a movie which explores the topics of love and memory?  And you decide to hire the maniacal Jim Carrey as the star?  Somehow it all comes together just about perfectly in this movie.  It's so good to see a film which not only admits that we often fall for the wrong person for no good reason, but also admits that sometimes we just can't work it out no matter how hard we try.  Jim Carrey is shy and insecure (he plays it well!), Kate Winslett is the party girl, and they are hopelesly in love.  Most movies would have them end up together, but this one doesn't, and that ends up being one of its strong points. <br /> <br />Charles Kaufman has made two movies about how our brains work (Being John Malkovich and Adaptation) but this one is sadder than either of those.  Still funny, but sadder.  Kaufman has a firm grasp on how memory works, how time tends to nurture the good memories and blur the bad ones.  Carrey and Winslett seem to meet seveeral times during the film, with each being the start of a beutiful relationship.  When they break up and Winslett impulsively has him erased from her memory, he vindictively does the same.  Since the end of the relationship vanishes first, happy times are left and he wants to keep those memories.  Much of the humor comes from the various places he tries to hide Winslett in his brain, such as childhood fights, babysitting, and a scene of teenage self-pleasuring.  Unfortunately for Carrey, the brainwashers (literally) are too good at their jobs, despite their own love and memory problems. <br /> <br />This is a quirky romantic comedy which will appeal to anyone who likes films just a bit off-center.
B00005MP58|5.0|I loved this movie!  It was kept very true to the original story, so much more so than the black and white version.  I would recommend this to any Jane Austin fan!
B00008G9JN|5.0|What a great album, the whimsical Songs from the Wood has stayed beautifully fresh.  Its a record that will stand the test of time.    Its light, melodic, charming and a pleasure to listen to from start to finish.  A must for any Tull fan, or fan of british/celtic folk rock.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I am shocked at these negative reviews. I see people saying how much better the first 2 movies were, and I'm just shocked. This movie improved on the first 2 in every single way! The look of the movie, the camera work, the amazing views, etc. This movie gave you a scope of Hogwarts, unlike the first 2 movies. I can actually visualize the Hogwarts grounds because they actually showed them. The first 2 movies, though, just jumped from scene to scene. Prisoner of Azkaban, though, feels smoothly edited, and it flows nicely.     The Dementors are creepy and intense, and although I wish they had explained the Dementor's Kiss a little more, (it would have made them more creepy,) they still were very well done. Unlike Columbus, (the director of the first 2 movies,) who'se idea was to duplicate the book scene by scene, Cuaron decides to put his own spin on certain scenes. Talking skulls, elephants in hotel rooms, etc.....the imagination is much more apparent. The movie's last half hour (or so) COMPLETELY replicates the fun and excitement of the books, something the first 2 movies were never were able to do. The book was still better, but this movie is really awesome, and comes very close to being as great as the book. Finally, the days of Harry Potter being treated as \\"kiddy movies\\" are over. When watching this movie, I get the feeling that the movie was made for everyone, whereas when watching the first 2 movies, I got the feeling that they were for a younger audience. And, based on comments from Mike Newell, who will be directing the 4th movie, the series will continue down this darker, more mature path, just like the books. Parents; keep in mind-this movie has some intense scenes.    For those who are complaining about the lack of the Marauder's Map explanations...I would really like you to watch the Shrieking Shack scene again, and try to find out exactly where that whole explanation should go. Where can they suddenly start talking about the map? Try to figure that out.It just wouldn't have worked. Where in the scene could Lupin have suddenly said, \\"You know....back when we were at Hogwarts....\\" etc.? There will be plenty of time to reveal this in movies 4 and 5 (Espechily 5.)    Flaws? Yes, there were some flaws. The action scenes, while cool, weren't exactly as thrilling as the ones in Chamber of Secrets. (action scenes that were sort of lacking included a werewolf chase, as well as the Quidditch match.) All the other action was great, though. I do also think that while all the details that were left out are BEST LEFT OUT, (for now,) I think they should have slowed down some of the explanation scenes to make clearer what was ACTUALLY SAID in the film. A very important explanation scene in the Three Broomsticks bar, as well as in the Shrieking Shack, move by a little too quickly and may confuse those who have not read the books. Also, the last....minute or so of this movie left A LOT to be desired. Why does Kloves continue to write bad endings? The first movie had an OK ending. The 2nd movie's ending was really horrible. This one, while not as bad as Chamber of Secrets's, is still lame. All I can say is that Kloves had BETTER NOT try to squeeze a cheesy, happy ending out of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.     Those flaws aside, though, we have a great Harry Potter movie that, while not as great as the books, is still really impressive, fun, exciting, and scarry.
B0000004F9|5.0|I first got interested in the Soft Machine as a fan of Pink Floyd (both bands frequented the London Underground in the late 60's), and found them to be startlingly different from the early Floyd.  After a couple years I returned to these albums and was pleasantly surprised!  The Soft Machine deftly combine 60's psych-pop, jazz, and rock into a unique sound that stands up to repeated listenings more than most music today.  The music is generally raucous and crazy, but after you listen to it a few times you start to notice the order, and can really enjoy the uniqueness.  The instrumentals are awesome--interplay between organ, drums, bass and vocals make for intricate rockers with priceless moments.  Wyatt's lispy voice is off-putting at first, but endearing on more listens, aided by his clever and often witty lyrics.  Songs like \\"A Certain Kind,\\" \\"Save Yourself,\\" \\"Lullabye Letter,\\" and \\"Why Are We Sleeping,\\" are great 60's psych-pop, with good hooks, but still original-sounding.  The second album sees the line up of the band change, and become slightly less poppy.  The second half is more jazzy, less song-oriented, but no less clever--hidden in the lyrics are a thank-you to the Jimi Hendrix Experience for the tour, and a great jab at Schoenberg's \\"Pierrot Lunaire\\" (classical).  Overall, both albums are great and very lasting pleasures.  The only thing I don't like is that they're both on the same CD; it's great to save the money, but it detracts from the individual character of each album--since they're not a very song-oriented band, the importance lies mostly on the overall sound and flow of each album (which is why it's a great idea to listen to the whole of each album at a time).  I'm not complaining though--it's a cheap way to get ahold of some timeless, unique music.  Recommended!
B0002XDODU|2.0|I like Rammstein quite a bit.  This cd is ok, but is way below par.  Definately my least favorite of their cds.  I can listen to it while cleaning or farting around.  But if you are looking for something to crank up in your car this cd does not offer vary much past the first two songs.
B0000024RZ|5.0|Dylan's third album finds him writing songs with a heavily political bent, taking ideas from newspapers and setting them to old and new folk melodies.  Though it lacks some of \\"Freewheeling\\"s light-hearted moments, \\"Times\\" comes across as more mature, often more emotionally moving, and darker.  The title track became a Dylan anthem and concert staple.  \\"Ballad Of Hollis Brown\\" is one of my personal favorites--the folk guitar and brooding story are perfect, with a clever ending.  \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" is a bit darker on this disc than on \\"Nashville Skyline,\\" but is also folkier.  \\"Boots Of Spanish Leather\\" is an excellent and touching love song.  \\"Hattie Carrol\\" is one of Dylan's most famous newspaper songs, and stirs feelings of racism and the fallibility of the justice system.  The closer is somber and characteristic of the whole album, but I like the whole thing.  Dylan's voice is good (better than on \\"Another Side of Bob Dylan\\") and the songs fit well together in the album's scheme.  This is Dylan's last protest album, and sees Dylan at the top of his protest period.  Recommended if you like acoustic folk, and suggested that you take a few listens to let it really sink in!
B0006213WG|5.0|Chuck is a far better album then Sum 41's earlier albums. Its harder, more rocking, and better overall. We're All to Blame is my favorite Sum 41 song ever. It is lyrically and musically superior to any other song they have had. The cd has heavy rocking songs and slower songs such as pieces which has awesome lyrics and is extremely catchy. If you listen to sum 41 or not you should get this cd.
B000002UA2|5.0|\\"Obscured By Clouds\\" is definitely overlooked by many radio-fed Pink Floyd fans, but remember--just because you haven't heard it before, doesn't mean it's no good!  This album features some of Pink Floyd's most easy-going songwriting--before they got more tied up in concept and less accessible (aka the bad parts of The Wall).  The overall sound of the record is classic Floyd--atmospheric, moody, psychedelic, and trippy.  The opening instrumentals set a great mood--Gilmour's slide guitar is evocative, and both songs rock.  \\"Burning Bridges\\" is a good marriage of Wright's songwriting and Waters' lyrics, and is a predecessor of \\"Breathe.\\"  \\"The Gold . . .\\" is one of the most rocking songs Pink Floyd has written--it's really cool to hear them actually loosen up and rock out.  \\"Wot's . . . Uh, the Deal?\\" is an EXCELLENT folk-rock ballad that deserves some recognition next to some of the Floyd's most famous works.  \\"Mudmen\\" is great--the interplay between Wright's organ and Gilmour's distorted guitar is as good as any other classic Floyd.  \\"Childhood's End\\" seems like a slightly-devolved version of \\"Time\\"--less compelling and solidly constructed, but it rocks nonetheless.  \\"Free Four\\" is a rocker with a great guitar solo, featuring some of Roger Waters' first lyrics about war/his dad (see \\"the Wall,\\" \\"Final Cut\\" where he plays this out).  \\"Stay\\" is one of Rick Wright's strongest songs; it's touching and features some great wah-guitar from Gilmour.  The album closes with the trippy \\"Absolutely Curtains,\\" an instrumental with some native singing.  This album is one of my top 3 Pink Floyd albums--overall, it's nearly as solid as \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" with none of the hype.  If you own the other two--you'd definitely be interested in this, and if it doesn't initially strike you, give it a couple listens.  It's Pink Floyd getting down to the basics, and succeeding at rocking like a true classic rock band.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is one of my favorite cds ever. I love every single song on this cd. It was weezer who got me really starting to play guitar and write music. Rivers, lead guitar and lead vocals, is one of the best modern songwriters out there. If you have the ability to hear you must buy this album. Get this and Pinkerton and you are ready to rock.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I absolutely love this cd I have always been a huge shania fan so of course i bought this cd right away i think that it is really great that i can now have all of my favorite shania songs on one cd. <br />
B000093BDX|5.0|Before this compilation arrived, I had other beach boys greatest hits albums.. But they always missed a few songs that I really liked (don't worry baby and when I grow up to be a man).  This compilation has all of the songs that the others lacked and is the ultimate collection that includes all of the beach boys songs.  Don't hesitate to purchase it.  The beach boys are a group that everyone should have in their music collection.
B000654Z2I|5.0|This double LP was perhaps one of the most advanced, and forward thinking creations of its day. It remains that way even now, due to the timeless coming together of influences, and cultural perspectives. First off, you have two strong personalities in this band, Czukay and Schmidt, who are the bass and keyboard players. Both were classically trained, and studied under Stockhausen. Even though this was Can's third offical LP (or fourth, if you count \\"DELAY\\" as the first LP, and you should), it was the first LP where the new singer, DAMO SUZUKI, completely dominates. With this Japanese world traveler, and wildman, Can had entered into what most people feel to be their best period, and with this album, their best work. Some of the songs are a whole LP side long, like \\"Halleluwah\\", or \\"Aumgn\\". But never are they tedious. The drummer, Jaki Liebeszeit, is like a drum machine with his incredible precision. Damo Suzuki has been very influencial, singing his spontaneous lyrics comprised of a minimalist, surreal mix of Japanese, English and German. This lead Mark E. Smith of THE FALL to write a song, \\"I AM DAMO SUZUKI\\", as an homage. Their sound is all over the arty end of the British punk/new wave scene. Even a recent pop band named themselves SUZUKI MOONIE, after the two CAN singers. As for trying to discribe the music, no one can. I can guarentee you however, after you hear a song like MUSHROOMHEAD, it lives with you forever.  Hearing the CD, it's almost impossible to think that this was recorded in 1971, on a two track machine, mostly live, with some overdubs.  It could have been recorded in 1979, 1988, 1997 or tomorrow. Their bass player was the tape engineer, and the band produced the LP themselves, in their famous INNER SPACE studio.  Having their own studio afforded the band endless hours of experimentation, which is how masterpeices are created, through time and endless patience. I had thought myself musically very literate, but after I heard some of CAN's music, I ended up buying every CD they ever released, and all the solo material the bandmembers produced on their own. If I were to compair this music to anything else, I might say in some ways WHITE LIGHT era VELVET UNDERGROUND, but with much more musicality, and a broader pallette of sound colors, melodic lines from around the world, and the formal connections with Stockhausen, as opposed to the Velvet Underground's formal connections with the FLUXUS movement, and LaMonte Young. Perhaps if the VU had stayed together, with NICO, JOHN CALE, MOE and Sterling and Lou, and added more ethnomusicology to their sound, they would have evolved like this. These are the types of musicians who could jam on a single song for hours, and always remain inventive, even revolutionary. Their concerts from this time, were more like happenings, and multimedia art events. So, if you want to hear the true predecessor to the best work of THE FALL, WIRE, BAUHAUS, PERE UBU and PUBLIC IMAGE LTD, go here. Neophytes to the band, might be better served with the excellent 2CD collection \\"CAN ANTHOLOGY... 20 years\\". Many of these songs from TAGO MAGO appear there in edited form. Also, a wider perspective on the band's entire catalouge can be sampled that way. Some of their work is easier to digest than others. However, don't wait to discover this band like I did. These new remasters are a great reason to take the sonic plunge.nded up buying every CD they ever released, and all the solo material the bandmembers produced on their own.

B0000399WI|5.0|I'll admit, I was never interested in films set in prison.  I usually lean more towards romantic comedies..  But who could've ever imagined that a film based on friendship and perseverance could be so engaging and just flat out good?  This is truly one of the BEST movies I have ever seen (along with City of God, the Pianist, Amelie, Life is Beautiful, Ever After and Bowling for Columbine) and I would recommend it to everyone.  It is a must for your movie collection.
B0006399FS|4.0|This album deserves 4 and a half stars. Here's why...While there may be only one GREATEST EVER song on this disc, there are 11 very, very good songs and 3 or 4 verge on greatness. In this way I think this disc is more consistent. POP seemed to drift off as did ZOOROPA and ATYCLB was uneven(and they all had so much potential). But this one sustained its energy throughout like all their better ones do. These boys have something to say and in this time of uncertainty when it seems everyone is growling aggression in their music, these guys sing and play of love; between father and son, man and woman, leader and country, ...of city, duty, and God. Their brash days of waving flags and singing for peace has been tempered with the wisdom of age and of loss. They still want to change the world but realize you can't make anyone do anything...you just love them and help them discover it for themselves. This disc is more direct, in its music, its lyrics, its overall message but the style of music is quite varied. They seem to have drawn off of all the musical styles theyve played with over the years, all the tangents coalescing into songs that are quite different yet disctincly U2. There are also many change-ups even in the same song and this is what I found most frustrating. Some of the songs sound like the best U2 ever and then there will be a changeup, sometimes more than one, that take the song into less great territory only to swing you back to greatness again. Perhaps take the tangents a little farther to see where it leads you...perhaps revel in where you are and just stay there awhile... I do have to admit that with more listenings my frustration lessens and the songs grow on me more and more. There is not a bad song on this album and some that are oh so very close to greatness. Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, Bomb, Unforgettable Fire, War. My biggest gripe is that there are only 12 songs...
B00005JMAH|4.0|As the Harry Potter books become bigger and bigger, more must be left out to make the film fit in the allowable 2 - 2.5 hours running time.  Thus, the burden falls on the scriptwriter to include enough of the detail of Rowling's book so that the series is advanced, but not so much that the film becomes confusing for those that haven't read the book.  This film seems to reach that fine balance (that forever eluded Peter Jackson in the LotR films).  Thus, it is enjoyable for those that only know Harry Potter from the previous films, and includes enough inside jokes and plots to satisfy the fans of the books. <br /> <br />The story: Sirius Black, convicted of murder and betraying Harry's parents to the evil wizard Voldemort, has been in the wizards' prison of Azkaban for the last 13 years.  When he escapes, it's widely assumed he will come after Harry, so the prison's guards - spectral horrors called Dementors - are dispatched to Hogwarts School to protect Harry and the other students.  Meanwhile, Harry has more mundane but no less important (to him) issues - teachers he hates, an unsigned permission slip, and battles with his rival Draco Malfoy. <br /> <br />The new director, Alfonso Cuaron, brings a brand new look to Hogwarts, now situated in the rough and rugged Scottish mountains.  The school looks completely at home there, and one of the joys of the film is the mixture of the fantastic (hippogriffs, etc.) superimposed on the gorgeous scenery.  The Dementors are especially well-envisioned.  They are as creepy as the books suggest - so much so that younger viewers (say, less than age 10) might find them too intense.  However, the Harry Potter books grow steadily more mature and dark as the characters age - it's only right that the films follow suit. <br /> <br />Purists will argue that many events and characters are left out of the film.  This is missing the point - the film itself is enjoyable on its own and self consistent, which is what is important.  This DVD edition looks great, as expected.  There are a few extras of varying quality.  There are a number of silly games involving the arrow keys on the standard DVD remote, but they seem rather pointless.  The interviews with the cast members (in small groups) are quite good, and there are some multi-angle features that allow you to explore the Hogwart's universe, which Potter fanatics will appreciate.
B0000029GA|5.0|read the previous reviews. <br /> <br />this is the Hip Hop album of the century.  there will never be another like it.  not in a million years.  many have tried.  all have failed.  and to think, these verses came from a kid. a kid who didn't even finish school.
B0002XDODU|5.0|\\"Reise, Reise\\" is the latest edition to Rammstein's discography and while it is notably different that doesn't mean it has to be disappointing. I always make it a point to expect nothing of anyone (let alone musicians) so that when they deliver something they never can fail my hopes- because I have none. When I picked up this CD and put it in I liked it considerably, but as the weeks have gone on and I've come to get to know each song I can only say this: HOT DAMN! What a record! Anyone who didn't like this really needs to sit back down and run back through it because Rammstein delivers more than 100% here: The quality of the music, the mixing, the vocals- everything here paints a masterpiece of music. This is the best album I've heard in years. <br /> <br />1: Reise, Reise (Voyage, Voyage/Arise, Arise) The band blows us all away with this powerful opening track with a title of two meaings (one based on an olden day fisherman wakeup call). The lyrics, the vocal distortions, the instruments- it all comes together and builds into a dramatic chorus which has a fell like their songs \\"Mein Herz Brent\\" and \\"Sonne\\". It is beautiful and ends with an accordian solo that just completes it (no matter how odd that sounds). <br /> <br />2: Mein Teil (My Thing): First off I have to say this song is the hardest song on the albumn, but the other songs hold up in their own ways. Mein Teil is a song based on that cannibal who placed an add in a paper for someone to eat- and got a reply (this really happened). Till's voice is a lot more menacing and high during the verses and deep and cool during all the other brilliantly crarfed interludes and chorus. This song will never bore you- it's a gem. I love the creepy grinding/mixing and choir part in the end. <br /> <br />3: Dalai Lama: Probably the best track on the album all about- but not my favorite. This song is beautiful, strange and creepy- and I believe that the most time was spent on this one. Lyrics are based off a poem about a father who suffocates his son while trying to save him. The chorus harmonies are incredible and the guitars are so groovy! Everyone came together like never before here, each musical part complimenting each other wonderfully. It's a mid paced song I guess, but picks up in the end especially. <br /> <br />4: Keine Lust (No Desire): The sexual song on this album- they all need at least 1!- but this time it's about not feeling like doing it. This is a fast song with a driving, quick melody line and incredible lyrics. This one sounds more like their older songs with the guitar playing more of a set rhythm. It's fabulous and addictive- especially the mixing that sounds like those austrailian diggerydoos. <br /> <br />5: Los (Less): This is without a doubt the most dancible song they've ever done. This also is the song that seems least like their style as it's got a blues sound to it (even a harmonica). The words of this song are all plays on the German language including on where they call themselves Godless or God, depending on how you look at it. Groovy and great beat. Despite it being so different for them they pull it off with ease and mastery. <br /> <br />6: Amerika (America): Weee... Um, this song is aparently causing a lot of contravery amongst fans- oh well. I have to say this song is great- no really! The words and melody are beautiful, the mixing is great- especially the techno solo in the end that sounds like you walked into an arcade. It's witty and sad feeling and has great guitars to it- hard and driving! Great choir in this too. All in all I think it's another of the best songs on here. <br /> <br />7: Moskau (Moscow): I. LOVE. THIS. SONG.- but it's still not my favoite. This is the best of the harder songs on the album. The lyrics might upset Russians, but oh well. The highlights of this song are the Russian chick singing along with him through the whole song \\"Ras, Dva, Tre!\\" and the melody line is so unique and cool. The duo vocals play brilliantly off each other and the accordian solo makes this song, sounding sober and longing and pretty. The music is really good in this one- must have been a lot of fun to write and record. A lot of heart went into this and it is amazing. Too bad it's not a single- it would be great. <br /> <br />8: Morganstern (Morning Star): For those who don't know \\"Morning Star is another name for the devil. This song is I think the third hardest song on the album and is very pretty despite that with an amazing choir part singing along during the chorus and in their own little solo part. The guitars are again like the usual grinding riffs that everyone loves. The words of this one are different than what you'd expect with such a pretty melody. Diffenently a great listen.  <br /> <br />9: Stein Um Stein (Stone By Stone): The second hardest song on the album actualy starts out sounding really soft and perhapes beautiful, but quickly turns raw and rough during the chorus. I LOVE this song too. It transitions back and forth from pretty to goth wonderfully and Tills lyrics are deep and wonderful- especially when he screams in this song (which he does a lot). The words are about building a house around himself and his love- in the most disturbing way you could imagine- it's a masterpiece again. Love when he ends on \\"ramm\\" in the verse and screams out \\"STEIN!\\" which leads into an incredible guitar solo. <br /> <br />10: Ohne Dich (Without You): I know I'm writing a lot about each song, but they're all so good they deserve the long descriptions! Really! And this one deserves the most credit I think. It is the most heartwrenching, beautiful thing they have ever written. The words are so tragic and sad and Till sounds so pretty in this song. I love the strings and the piano and the guitars- and the pretty pretty bass part. It's soooo sad! It's gorgeous, it definantly should get some award or something. You'll love it once you hear it- there's no way you can't... maybe if you're in denail... <br /> <br/>11: Amour: THIS is my favorite song on the album! (those who have heard it all turn and look at me like I have a brain disease). No really! I cannot get enough of this song! It starts out sounding like it will be really simple and cool with the guitar part and drums with Till speaking quietly and deeply over- even the first chorus is just as quiet as the verses. It is so deep and rumbly and eerie sounding- this uncooth song about love ripping you apart like an animal. The rhythm of the words song is great too. But when you get to the middle of the song where it picks up, you'll understand why I love this song. It is the most haunting song on the album, perhaps the most haunting they've ever done. I love the end where Till goes up a notch and sings a bit higher ending with the repeated spoken plea \\"Bitte, Bitte, gib mir gift!\\" or, \\"Please- PLEASE, give me poison.\\"  <br /> <br />This album is better than any other- it is a whirlwind of talent and musical genious. No one can deny it- even if it was not what they wanted (or expected). They have finally reached the extent of musical skills we've all been waiting for. It's great to see a band grow and grow and grow. Let's see what happens next with them!
B00005B36H|5.0|i could bore you with lots of the same old stuff every other person for the last several years have said here, but i wont. This album rocks, its amazing, and if you dont own it, you should click the little add to cart button at the top of this page and buy it.  Tool is one of the best, if not the best band of all time, thats pretty powerful to say isnt it? i mean, you have metallica, godsmack, aerosmith, led zepplin, and hundreds of amazing bands to choose from, but tool's music seems to just blow almost everything else away! :-)
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Farrel is wonderful as the loveable elf- I mean human- named Buddy- who was RASIED by elves. He's naive and loving and kind and thinks that everyone believes in santa and elves- much to the dismay of his father, who he's sought out to be reunited with. The movie is witty and smart- and even just plain ridiculous at times- like when Buddy eats cotton balls at the doctors office, or freaks out when he hears Santa is coming to a department store. What's even more lovable about this movie is the lesson it teaches as Buddy teaches his father the importance of family over his work. It's cute and funny (love the claymation Burl Ives Esque Snowman in the northpole!), and enjoyable for everyone. Pick it up- you won't be disappointed with this one, it's got just enough story to keep one interested without becoming dull as it goes on.
B000009O8A|1.0|Yes, there is realism in this flick -- the brutal gang-rape of the main character, which goes on and on until your stomach is ready to leap up and throttle your brain. I'll give it that, hence its one and only star. But that's where the realism ends. After that, it is one of the most poorly acted, far-fetched pieces of tripe you'll ever see. The reactions to the rape are completely unrealistic, and the revenge killings are so stupid and ham-fisted you'll wonder if Zarchi even bothered to think them through before rolling the camera. One victim actually walks into a noose and is hanged while being seduced by the woman he just raped. Give me a break, people. It's just too stupid to even be funny. <br /> <br />Attempts to justify this movie as a feminist commentary on society (somehow empowering rape victims by turning them into murderers) all fall flat. Zarchi fails where Wes Craven succeeds in \\"Last House on the Left\\" -- mostly because Zarchi missed the point in favor of shock value. His characters are flat, emotionless, and unmotivated. Therefore, we don't care if any of them live or die, which is a real shame considering the subject matter. <br /> <br />Watch Ingmar Bergman's \\"The Virgin Spring.\\" That film shows how otherwise \\"good\\" people can be driven to acts of extreme brutality. Bergman shows us terror, desire, grief, rage, ambiguity, and transformation -- all the things that make us human. Zarchi and his lot show us a lengthy rape scene, and some lame movie blood. After seeing the subject handled so much better by others (Bergman in particular, but Craven's no slouch), Zarchi can only be taken as a cheap, exploitational insult to the intelligence of even the lowest of brows. <br />
B00000JG41|5.0|Insane, Heavy, Melodic, Sad, Dark, Beautiful, Uplifting, Depressing, Slow, Fast, Relaxing, Stressful. This is possible the greatest album I've ever heard. Mike, Trey, and Trevor are geniuses.
B0006399FS|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch U2's free show in Brooklyn last week, and as such, there are few songs that I've had the benefit of hearing live:<br /><br />\\"Vertigo & All Because Of You\\"<br />Bono and the boys dove head first into \\"Vertigo,\\" and then came right back with \\"All Because of You.\\" Two great singles that really got the crowd pumped.  Vertigo is a direct decendent of Elevation from ATYCLB, and All Because Of You just plain kicks ass.<br /><br />\\"Miracle Drug\\"<br />Bono then introduced \\"Miracle Drug.\\" He told the story of a paraplegic classmate who, after years of silence, decided to take a chance and have a device attached to his head that would allow him to type.  With this device, and the help of a drug that allowed him to move his head ever so slightly, the man proceeded to write an award-winning collection of poems. It's a fantastic song for a truly inspirational tale.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\"<br />Next was \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own.\\" I had read that this song was pretty much a conversation between Bono and his father, Bob, who had passed away in 2001. It's an absolultely beautiful song. While introducing it, Bono explained that he believes that the dead leave gifts for their loved ones after they've gone, and his father blessed him by allowing him to hit notes with his voice that he hasn't been able reach in over a decade. As the band began to play, he said, \\"OK Bob, here we go, don't f**k up now!\\" I absolutely love this song, and it is high in the running for favorite on the new album.<br /><br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\"<br />This song apparently has a few meanings. Bono explained that at one level, it's about the band's love for New York, but also about lost innocence. Somehow, I think that the two probably go hand in hand! \\"City\\" is a great song, and with Manhattan in the background, it was truly magical.<br /><br />\\"Original Of The Species\\"<br />The band paused for a moment as Bono was equipped with a guitar. He then introduced \\"Original Of The Species,\\" which elicited a cheer from the crowd. Bono stopped, looked at the crowd inquisitively, and said, \\"How do you know this sh*t?\\" This of course led to another loud cheer. Bono began laughing and pointed to someone in the crowd. \\"Edge,\\" he said, \\" I think we found the guy that stole that CD!\\" The band shared a quick laugh, then proceeded to send chills through the crowd with an absolutely gorgeous rendition of what's sure to become a classic.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts on the rest of the album:<br /><br />\\"Love and Peace or Else\\"<br />Upon first listen, this song felt out of step with the rest of the album. It's definitely the most adventurous track musically. Now, after about 20 or so listens, I find it sonically intriguing. I'm peeling back the layers and finding new things to like about it! The fact that it rocks pretty hard doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />\\"A Man and a Woman\\"<br />A very sexy track, cut from the same cloth as \\"When You Wear That Velvet Dress\\" from \\"POP\\". I got the image of two lovers dancing very close and whispering to one another when listening to this.<br /><br />\\"Crumbs From Your Table\\"<br />With all of the work Bono's been doing on behalf of debt relief and AIDS research, you knew that it would seep through into his music. It's all here, and out on his sleeve, \\"Where you live should not decide whether you live or whether you die.\\"<br /><br />\\"One Step Closer\\"<br />Apparently, Bono got the lyric from a conversation he had with Noel Gallagher of Oasis. The two had been discussing Bono's father's health when Noel asked Bono if his was religious. Bono explained that his father had never really been sure, to which Noel replied, \\"Well, he's one step closer to knowing, isn't he?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yahweh\\"<br />Classic U2. Here's a track which could have been the last song on any of the past several albums, going all the way back to Joshua Tree.<br /><br />Overall, a very satisfying musical experience. One thing that's particularly intriguing is the change in Bono's lyrics. He is much more direct this time around, and you feel as if you're intruding on conversations he's having, with his deceased father, his wife, his children, even God. It's quite moving.u're intruding on conversations he's having, with his deceased father, his wife, his children, even God. It's quite moving.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|ROC will knock you down within the first minute.  This album is nothing but pure energy.  Lyrics are catchy enough to want to sing along with every song (without being cliche')  Guitars and bass are raw and relentless.  The drumming is hypnotic.  If you need a cd you can listen to virtually every single day, this is it.  Also, Vaya is an EP that is worth buying if you enjoy ROC.
B00067BBQE|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Evanescence and was really excited to hear the release of a live DVD/CD since I've been to 2 of their shows this year. The concert footage however, is horribly done. The camera zooms in and out of the band in seconds, while digital effects and lights make it so hard to watch. I don't think theres even one scene where the camera lays still on a member of the band. Not to mention, the bad nose bleed angle views from the audience, and too many annoying shots of the crowd. whats the point of that? I got dizzy after 30 minutes and had to shut it off. <br />But besides the horrible visuals, the music is amazing, the band played well and Amy Lee's vocals were on point. The best part was the Korn cover \\"Thoughtless\\" where she took the song to another level.  <br />The DVD also features all of their incredible music videos and a 50 minute behind the scenes documentary, which is worth buying for rather then the concert itself.
0679735259|5.0|Herr was a war correspondent for Esquire magazine in Vietnam during the months of the Hill Fights of `67 through the winter to the Tet Offensive and on past the spring months of '68.  In his memoir, \\"Dispatches\\", he focuses primarily upon the Battle for Hue and the Siege of Khe Shan but there are glimpses of other battles. He covers Vietnam reflecting upon everything from the bar scenes of the large cities to the terror of incoming while in trenches of firebases in an outpouring of confused and conflicted memories.  Like a rock skimming across a pond he touches upon the drugs, the blaring of rock and roll, the freaks and the street-talking young toughs. In a few well-written sentences he eviscerates the information officers and the official line but spends several introspective pages exploring the parasitic nature of war correspondents. He rarely offers an opinion; he just tells in a stream of consciousness what he saw and heard. But this is not a book of great battles and heroic deeds.  It is a book about average troops and a handful of war correspondents, for whom he held deep affection, and what they had to cope with and how some of them died.<br /><br />\\"I saw that face at least a thousand times at a hundred bases and camps, all the youth sucked out of the eyes, the color drawn from the skin, cold white lips, you knew he wouldn't wait for any of it to come back.  Life had made him old, he'd live it out old.\\"<br /><br />Reading this book you feel and are touched by Vietnam and several excellent passage leave you feeling empty. Hard for a book to evoke that kind of response but this one does. Excellent writing, a damn good book.
1400031567|5.0|\\"Sidetracked\\" is a wonderful example of the impressive writing skill of Swedish author Henning Mankell.<br /><br />Celebrated police inspector Kurt Wallendar based in the southern town of Ystad is anticipating the start of the summer and a well deserved vacation.  Quite unexpectedly he is called to investigate a young girl who has been hiding in a field of rapeseed on a farm on the outskirts of town.  After conferring with the aged farmer, he approaches the girl only to watch in horror as she douses herself with gasoline, lights a match and turns herself into a human inferno.<br /><br />Badly shaken Wallendar returns to the station house confident that the forensic investigation has been properly undertaken.  In this usually criminally sedate time of year, he again is jolted to learn of a reported homicide.  Previous Minister of Justice Gustaf Wetterstedt, a wealthy, powerful yet despised individual with alleged underworld connections is found in his seaside villa with his head split open by an axe and part of his scalp cut off.<br /><br />So begins a series of murders committed by a psychopath who fancies himself as being imbued with the spirit of indian chief Geronimo.  He paints his face and stalks his victims while walking around barefoot.  Soon a wealthy but allegedly corrupt art dealer is also found scalped and his face cleaved by an axe.<br /><br />Wallendar and his team begin an intensive and exhaustive probe into these violently savage killings which continue on.  They are stymied in trying to identify the murderers identity but continue doggedly investigating.<br /><br />While the psychopathic killer is eventually identified midway through the book,  Mankell expertly whets our appetite by giving us little clues as to his psychological profile.  When the startling revelation is finally made, we can understand why Wallendar has been flummoxed.<br /><br />Mankell gives us deep insight into the exasperation of Wallendar and his fellow officers as the inquest spills into the surrounding towns as victims begin mounting.  They are tirelessly working against the clock to prevent further killings and Mankell elaborates about the psychological toll that is created.<br /><br />Mankell is very adept at combining crime drama with its psychological ramifications to create an extremely engrossing novel.the inquest spills into the surrounding towns as victims begin mounting.

B0000024YL|4.0|this is a well put together cd, with the exception of the surprise live tracks.  and even then, the audience sounds extremely canned, almost making me cringe. <br /> <br />but, the songs are so good, that i am willing to ignore the fact that this has some live tracks on it.
B000000HU1|5.0|I received a copy of Gong's [b]You[/b] a few days ago. This is the 2004 re-master released through Virgin records. It is also a \\"copy controlled\\" CD. Now the online CD seller did note this in the product description, but I didn't really know what it meant. Well a \\"copy controlled\\" disc means that it isn't fully compatible with every CD player out there. <br /> <br />On the back of the sleeve, in very small print, it warns that the disc might not play back on every car stereo. Well, it doesn't play back on every portable/personal CD player either. It did fine on my home, component, DVD player and on my very new Sony boom-box, but on my four or five year old Phillip's disc player it get drop-outs and cracks at odd intervals through out the disc. Now 90% of my listening is done via my \\"discman\\", so I've paid retail for a disc I effectively can't listen to, not to mention how they've choosen to jack the cover art with their \\"copy control\\" logos, disclaimers, and rants against on-line file trading. <br /> <br />I'm pretty sure that this was a decision made at Virgin and not one that lay with the band. Now Virgin is free to do what they like with their product, but I'd suggest avoiding stuff with the \\"copy control\\" logo/technology on it, especially if you have older equipment. The best I can tell is that they have engineered errors into the sound file that most newer players can detect and fix, but when you try and rip the file, it is inherently corrupted. This is a ridiculous measure, because anyone can stream the music into their computer real-time and get an uncorrupted file. Or use the program Total Recorder, to do the same thing from the sound card. It is at best a speed-bump rather than a barrier, one that has already extremely inconvenienced me, not in trying to copy or trade the music illegally, but from legitimate enjoyment of a disc I purchased in good faith. <br /> <br />Of what I have heard of the content of this disc: it's brilliant!
B0002GTWYW|5.0|Earlier this month, Bad Boy, the once powerhouse hip-hop label now struggling to reclaim its heyday, re-released the Notorious B.I.G.'s debut CD, \\"Ready to Die,\\" nearly a decade after it originally appeared. It's an opportunistic moment for P. Diddy's Bad Boy to cash in on B.I.G's fame. But, commerce aside, it's time for B.I.G. to receive the acclaim he deserves.  <br /> <br />Notorious B.I.G., whose real name was Christopher Wallace, came into the rap game in the early 1990s, as hip-hop was still making the transition from an off-the-radar subculture to the mainstream.  <br />     <br />West Coast acts like Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were beginning to dominate hip-hop. New York City rap acts, despite hip-hop's Gotham City origins, were being dwarfed by Los Angeles-based rappers, both in popularity and in record sales. The West Coast rappers were putting down an in-your-face, take-no- prisoners rap style that was equal parts raw, street and rooted in gang life.  <br /> <br />Arriving in September 1994, \\"Ready to Die\\" was the East Coast version of that style. \\"If I wasn't in the rap game,\\" B.I.G. rapped on \\"Things Done Changed,\\" \\"I'd probably have a ki knee-deep in the crack game.\\" What was happening out West to hip-hop kids via gang-banging and the war on drugs was happening on the East Coast via crews and posses, Rudolph Giuliani's zero-tolerance-styled policing and more. \\"I'm seeing body after body and my mayor Giuliani ain't trying to see a black man turn to John Gotti,\\" B.I.G. laments on \\"Everyday Struggle.\\"  <br /> <br />B.I.G.'s arrival to the rap game helped raise New York hip-hop from obscurity and earned him the moniker King of New York.  <br /> <br />B.I.G. is best known by those outside the hip-hop world for his role in the infamous, so-called rap war, the East Coast-West Coast lyrical battle that turned violent, ultimately claiming the life of rapper Tupac Shakur in September 1996 and B.I.G's life six months later at age 24.  <br /> <br />The statesmanlike funeral B.I.G. received, replete with a procession through Brooklyn, only hinted at a celebrity often overshadowed by the more popular Shakur.  <br /> <br />But within hip-hop circles, B.I.G.'s claim to fame went beyond the bicoastal rap war. Fans applauded him for his complex, narrative rhyme style. But what most distinguished him was his sense of language, both his ability to make his words work and his skill at chopping and stretching them.  <br /> <br />This lyrical talent and his signature voice still enables B.I.G. to run circles around chart-topping rap acts today. B.I.G. spoke with a lisp, something that in a medium that depends on speech should have been a hindrance to success. B.I.G made it a strength. Big, black and beautiful, he even broke the glass ceiling on acceptable physical appearance with an anti-Abercrombie & Fitch image, endearing him to hip-hop fans.  <br /> <br />The re-released \\"Ready To Die\\" has been digitally re-mastered, includes several singles not on the original CD and comes with a DVD that includes footage of a previously unreleased outdoor concert performance. It's time for scholars to explore the impact both of his art as a literary testament and his impact on American youth. B.I.G.'s short life offers endless possibilities for understanding what it was like to come of age at the dawn of the millennium.  <br /> <br />The re-released CD reveals his significance to hip-hop kids. Is B.I.G. the greatest lyricist of all time? If I had to choose, pound for pound, rhyme for rhyme, whether the opponent be Tupac or Jay-Z, I'd pick Biggie every time. <br />
B0002VEXUA|3.0|This album is a great album. <br /> <br />But is it really worth re-releasing it on DVD? I mean the documentary is'nt that interesting. Just alot of people swearing and blabbering about how it was recorded and stuff. <br />Well what else can you talk about? But its not that interesting. <br />Lots of people talking and raving about how great it was, but I think thats just overating it. <br /> <br />They should wait till Oasis call it quits and then release a DVD on the band, instead of wasting time putting out this boring piece of gibberish. <br /> <br /> <br />The live performances are'nt that exciting and the only good music video is \\"Live Forever.\\" <br /> <br />Its actually much more interesting to watch the bonus DVD in which you get lots of funny and interesting stories about the band. <br /> <br />\\"Defintiley Maybe\\" is a really great and awesome album but its also an overated one at that. <br /> <br />As Liam Gallaghar said at the end  <br />\\"i did'nt think it was that good anyway, I though it was alright.\\" <br />
B000002LMM|4.0|It's OK to love schmaltz. Especially if it's self-conscious schmaltz. And if you're going to be alternately cloying and derivitive then you better be fun at the same time.

0395389496|5.0|I'd never read this book before, but I was invited by a friend of mine to go see the movie with her family.  Afterwards my friend insisted I read the book with them as well.  It is a tradition in their family they even have the cassette and the bell.  This book is great.  It is not as detailed as the movie so kids might be slightly disappointed.  However it is just as charming and a quick short read.  It will make a believer out of even the most skeptical.  Make this book a part of your family's traditions.  I know it will be a part of my holiday season from now on.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Josh Groban.  His music is beautiful and his voice is beautiful - like silk.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who wants to listen to a CD and get chills because I have listened to it over and over yet I still get chills when I listen to it.  It is amazing.  And once you listen to this you can understand why he has fans all over the world nicknamed - GROBANITES!!!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|okay yeah i LOVE this CD. its the not the kind of CD you listen to for like a month and then get sick of it. ive had it for like almost a year and still LOVVVVE it!! if you dont already own it GO BUY IT. kanye is amazing, i saw him in concert and i love him even more. hes got great songs, different beats, and some funny lil interlude things. he was come out with alot of new ideas for hip hop. keep it up kanye!!!
B00005JMJG|4.0|Despite what one hears in the press, particularly with politicians . . that if I had it to do over I would do the same thing . . . this movie gives us a more legitimate, more honest take on the concept.  Of course, there are things that we would have liked to do differently.  And in addition, what is it that defines love of one another.  What is love, and is it something integral in ones personality . . the love of one other individual . . that can not be erased.  This picture deals with these questions, and with these concepts, in a clever, if non-conventional manner.  There is something very special about true love, and it can not be taken away.  The trimmings may not be neat and pretty, but deep down there is love, or sunshine, and in that one spot in the mind there is something spotless.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|If you like South Park, you'll love the movie.  Its one of the rare comedies lately that the funniest parts of the movie arent given away in the trailer. <br /> <br />If you dont like or dont watch South Park,  most of the humor may escape you.  The person I saw it with thought there were two or three funny parts, while I thought the whole movie was great.  No for everyone true, but definitley for some especially with the DVD promising deleted scenes. <br /> <br />
0767817478|1.0|This is not Godzilla. This is a Jurassic Park T-Rex on steroids. If you want to see Godzilla, see the Japanese films. This film is basically a remake of the 1956 movie Godzilla, King of the Monsters and although the original is in black & white, it is far superior to this movie. If you like special effects, this may be the movie for you as \\"Godzilla\\" does look impressive, but unlike the real Godzilla, the CGI monster lacks character and soul. Sorry folks, but the Japanese have got us beat as far as making Godzilla movies and well they should since Godzilla is a Japanese original and 99% of the time the original is the best.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Matilda is a fantastic kids movie, with good acting and a great story that is based off the book by Roald Dahl who was a fantastic children's author. <br /> <br />The movie is about a young girl who is very bright and wants to learn, but unfortunatly is saddled with parents who are uncaring and completely emotionally unattached to their daughters needs. Eventually she talks them into letting her go to school, and they enroll her in a private school run by Miss. Trunchbull, a sadistic authoritarian who wants nothing to do with children, other then ordering them around like soilders. <br /> <br />Matilda befriends her teacher, Miss Honey, and through a series of aggrivations Matilda finds that she has telekenetic powers. In the end, she puts The Trunchbull in her place and leaves her uncaring parents to live in a happier and more loving enviorment. <br /> <br />The movie is a great one for children, even young children enjoy this movie. It really isn't that scary, and what scaryness there is, has a lot of humor through it. The music in this movie is really great as well, it includes the song \\"Send Me On My Way\\" by Rusted Root that is an extremly catchy and fun song.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This film is genuinely heartwarming.  The young Billy Elliot doesn't box like the other boys in his neighborhood--he dances.  The film traces one boy's love of ballet, the turmoil in his family life while he seeks the approval of his father, and the special relationship with his dance instructor.  If you have ever had a dream to do something with your life, you should watch this movie.  It is one of my favorites.
0634022296|4.0|Just like some of the other comments. This is a great Beatles book, the only problem is that the small page format along with the almost 400 pg. makes it near impossiable to open the book to a page and have it stay open. I liked the book and way the songs were done so well that I found a solution for the binding problem. I went to a local office supply store and bought a smaller sized 2\\" 3 ring binder. Then took the book to a speedy print shop were I had them drill 3 holes in the book for the binder and then cut the binding off of the book. Total cost 9 bucks, but now I can open it to any song I want and it stays there. Still this is one of the better books I have bought.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I can't get the image of him eating the gum off the subway stairwell out of my head.<br /><br />What is sure to become a Christmas classic for years to come, Elf is funny in the vein of films like Tommy Boy and Groundhog Day - although without the sexual innuendo that is so prevalent in most films these days. This is a great family film that my 4 year old loves just as much as I do.<br /><br />I'm always wary of films from Saturday Night Live cast members - its really been hit and miss with them. But this film is both well written and well performed. The story is simple enough: boy raised by Santa's elves, decides to search for his real family, falls in love, and saves Christmas when Santa's sleigh breaks down in Central Park, NY. Ferrell and Caan are a great matchup as father/son, and Bob Newhart is great as Papa elf.<br /><br />And then there's that subway gum scene...
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Paul McCartney was dissatisfied with Phil Spector's version of 'Let It Be'. Okay, putting that thought out of mind, here we have a new version of 'Let It Be' that is very different from the original release, but not at all a release to return the album back to the original idea of the 'Get Back' project. Therefore, we are giving a third offering of 'Let It Be' (or 'Get Back') that is an attempt to return the album to the original idea. While, the typical Beatles fan has only possibly listened to the second and third offerings (the first being 'Get Back' which any collector would have obtained a bootleg of). This is not a bad release though, it is superior to the original 'Let It Be', unless you like what Phil Spector did, but it is not 'as it was meant to be'. Maybe that is a good thing though, because with the technology the new producers (that's right, McCartney also hired new people to oversee the new album) used gives the songs a much warmer feeling than the original project could have. In the end, this might be for the Beatles fan only, but casual listeners should consider it too, because these are good songs. For me though, I'll take it and also wait for the day when they finally decided to release 'Get Back' in all it's glory... if that day ever comes!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Enough with the whiners and complainers who didn't think the sequels stood up to the quality of the first film. C'mon folks, the entire series was groundbreaking, totally unique, and worthy of nothing but praise. If Reloaded had been the first film, and Matrix released as a prequel, it would have received just as many attacks. Just stop it -- and appreciate the fect that these films stand out among so much theatric crap over the past few years. They are some of the most creative films (concept/story/effects) ever made. Period.<br /><br />As for this package -- all I can say is Holy Crap. If you can sit through all of the documentaries and various commentaries, your ears are going to bleed. Some people are into that. I happen to be one of those people who love the backstory, love to see how things are made, and especially love to see what was cut from the final product.<br /><br />Giddy-yap.
B00005JMAH|3.0|This is my least favorite of all three movies so far. I take major issues with the fact that this is the shortest of the Harry Potter movies yet it was the longest of the three books that have been made into a movie so far.  While it was only a difference of 20 minutes, so much could have been done with those 20 minutes. I understand that is essential for certain parts of a book to be lost when it is made into a movie. I thought the first two films did an excellent job and in those first two movies everything that was taken out didn't affect the heart of the story line. However, this movie cut out plot lines that were the very crux if the whole story. It glazed over certain things so quickly that people who hadn't read the book might have felt confused or unimpressed by the story itself.  Furthermore, there were things added that didn't need to be there, when they could have just as easily kept things that were lost.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day just keeps getting better. <br /> <br />I was a teen around the time of Dookie, and because of that I have always been big on that, Insomniac, Kerplunk!, and 1039 Smoothed out Slappy hours, while ignoring their newer stuff.  I listened to those 4 CD's over and over for years, and was afraid to hear their \\"new\\" side.  Within the last year or 2, I began listening to their newer stuff- Nimrod, Warning, Shenanigans.  I was afraid I wouldn't like them, but they have grown to be 3 of my favorite albums.   <br /> <br />As with many people, I was afraid to hear them change.  People claim they sold out, claim they no longer have it.  Those are people who are afraid of change, or just bandwagoners.   <br /> <br />I bought American Idiot the day I came out, and to me, it's almost like them coming full circle.  In my mind they're still as \\"punk\\" as they ever have been, and they just keep getting better.  They expand their horizons with every CD, and it always works.  If you're an old GD fan afraid to give this a chance, don't be.  It has songs with the vintage GD sound (Letterbomb), they have some great radio friendly songs (Wake me up when September ends, Boulevard of Broken dreams), they have fast (St. Jimmy), they have slow (Are we the Waiting).  It has it all.  Then when you listen to it and pick out your favorites, you realize the story behind it all, and then you can't stop listening to it in order.  I can't say there's a single track on this CD I don't like, and the only one I EVER skip is \\"Extraordinary Girl\\", mainly because Letterbomb is my favorite song. <br /> <br />Green Day has become by far my favorite band, and I saw them in Minneapolis and they blew me away.  I've been a fan for over 10 years, and I finally have accepted their different sounds. <br /> <br />And to the people who will claim the album sucks because it's not \\"punk\\", here's a quote from Mike Dirnt that says it all- (On Good Riddance: Time of Your Life): \\"Putting that song on our record wasprobably the most punk thing we could do.\\"   <br /> <br />Punk isn't an exact style of music.  It's being willing to push the boundaries, to make big changes, and still kick ass.  And that's what Green Day does on this album.

B000002HRE|5.0|Hehe, lots of you people down rating this album have absolutely no clue what you're on about, eg. One reviewer I recall states that \\"King Nothing\\" is the only good song on this CD, but it's not actually on ReLoad, 'tis on Load. Most reviews giving it less than 3 stars are less than 5 lines long, I'm not J.R.R Tolkein when it comes to writing but surely if you hate Metallica so much you can justify it a bit better. Lots of people going on about 'Kill 'em All' etc. and how Rock Metallica can't compare to the Heavy Metal, as far as I am concerned, Metallica have moved on from silly ole Metal, gets boring after a while, no? <br /> <br />Anyway, this is probably one of Metallica's most commercial albums, along with the Black Album, they won a lot of awards and praise for it, and in my opinion this is well deserved. Like \\"Load\\", \\"ReLoad\\" is a very diverse album, it varies a lot in sound, approach and at times I feel the genre of each track. It's not metal, its good hard, different rock. Many complain that the album is 'boring', but if you are a rocker and you find \\"Fuel\\" boring, something is up. Sure you may find the likes of \\"Low Man's Lyric\\" 'boring', but that's due to the fact it's a country, type, soothing ballad and if you're confined to heavy metal, not your thing. These conformities I feel, drag true attention to detail and beauty away from the Music. As I have stated before, I believe that Metallica's ability to reinvent their sound on each and every album is the trait of theirs that I truly admire. This particularly shines through in Metallica's vocal experiment with Marianne Faithful in \\"The Memory remains\\" but general creativity is evident throughout the record. <br /> <br />James Hetfield's assortment of vocal approaches to each song also add to the variety that this album offers. ReLoad was originally delayed from being released along with \\"Load\\" due to James' preference to work and construct upon the lyrics and vocals of each song, it payed off if you ask me, the well crafted lyrics and the varying tones and general vocal skill add to the joys of listening to this album. Jason Newsted is also a forceful presence on the vocal scene in many tracks; in particular the collage of vocals between Jason and James in \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" adds to the strength of the track and lends it a slight psychedelic tone and feel. <br />Lars does what he does best within this album, he keeps the beat going and his drums can at times offer big hitting ferocity to parts of songs such as \\"The Memory Remains\\" and Kirk, in traditional Metallica style, has plenty of excellent guitar solos throughout. <br /> <br />As for the individual tracks on the album, it's very hard for me to pick an outright favorite or recommendation. The opener \\"Fuel\\" has gone on to become a Metallica classic and has been played in every show of Metallica's 2004 \\"Madly In Anger\\" America tour. \\"The Unforgiven II\\" brings a hard, heavy sequel to the Black Album's \\"Unforgiven\\". All the tracks have attitude and meat with \\"Slither\\", \\"Carp Diem Baby\\", \\"Devils Dance\\" and Grammy Winning \\"Better Than You\\" showcases particular excellence and credibility. <br /> <br />On the whole, a wonderful record and an essential purchase for fans of not only Metallica, but good, decent music. Bring it down if you will but it is you who will lose out, not one for you 80's Metal Heads but those of you who give it a chance and listen well will, if not immediately hooked, in time come to appreciate and love it. <br /> <br />Didn't win all those awards and that Grammy for nothing now did it???

B00003CX95|1.0|As a true-born Scot I was terribly disappointed by this Hollywood \\"adaptation\\" of the story of Wallace. They got the names right, but that was about it. For example, Sir William Wallace was a junior lowlands nobleman, not a kilted highland peasant - that's a bit like portraying George Washington as a Native American. Then, yes they did once paint their faces blue in battle - but against the Romans, not against the English. Only about 1300 years out there. And so on throughout the film. The sad thing is, the actual story is so good in itself, there was no need to take liberties with it and mess it all up. But then, what can one expect of a director (Gibson) who managed to confuse the 18th Century British Army with the Waffen-SS in Normandy? (The Patriot) Giving this one star only because the review system won't let me award zero.
B00068IOWM|5.0|It is quite apparent some thought went into giving fans bang for the buck because this is a terrific meld of creative process and final product. The dvd is surprisingly good. It includes candid interviews on the making of the recording and it plays VERY well. This is quite impressive as most dvds included with cds feel slapped together with little thought to care of presentation. Not here. For god sake they've even included subtitles. This sets a new standard I hope more artists are able to emulate. It's great to see the production value that has become commonplace spreading to music releases. Not only do you get the dvd, but a small art book, nicely done. How does the music rank? It grows on you. Keep listening, you'll see. Lastly, the \\"Temple Bar Mix\\" of Vertigo is the coolest thing I've seen in years. Nice job, lads.
B000003N7G|5.0|It's a testament to John Coltrane's artistic vision that a piece of uncomprimising music such as a 'A Love Supreme' can be heard for the universalism it stands for. Recorded in a studio in New Jersey in late 1964, Coltrane had spent a week alone in a room in his house away from his wife and children. During that time of contemplation and isolation, he put pen to paper to bare his soul to God and the essence of 'A Love Supreme' was born. I don't think it was a coincedence that at the time this album was recorded in the mid-60's, a new philosophy of spirituality and peace & love began to prevade popular music in general. The Church of St. John Coltrane still resides in that bastion of hippiedom, San Francisco. <br /> <br />The music on the album itself is powerful not just for Coltrane's playing itself but also for the fanatical interplay of the quartet. 'Acknowledgement' opens with Garrison's passionate bass line, leading into Coltrane's dynamic and ingenious playing, the quartet's spirited performance like a fervant, untamed emotion that has gripped them all. 'Resolution' blazes from the record with Tyler burnishing the track with some brilliant playing of his own. Jones's frantic drumming comes to the fore on the opening of 'Pursuance', a track where the meaning of 'Chasin' The Trane' becomes self-evident as Garrison, Tyler and Jones follow in hot pursuit of their leader's furious joy. Tyler's playing is again compelling as the quartet trade notes with such alarming velocity before Garrison's bass tip-toes and leads us like the pied-piper to the concluding 'Psalm'. <br /> <br />It's refreshing in this day and age to hear an artist whose sincerity and integrity shines through his work.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is by far the best Slipknot album yet! The songs are loud and fun to listin to. Duality and Pulse of the maggots are the best. Vermillion (Part 1) is really creepy. Don't listin to Vermillion (part 2) it is acoustic! All the rest begin to sound like the same thing after a few times but the good ones never get old. the little booklet that comes with it has these really wierd pictures of the band. Take my advice and buy this C-D!
B00030590I|4.0|Good movie. Visually stunning. The interesting thing is that it came out two years ago, and up until a little while ago you could buy a DVD of it for about five bucks. Now that it's had a US theatrical release and Tarantino's name is splashed all over it, it's suddenly worth $20 more?<br /><br />Hmm. Feel exploited much?

B00003CXAT|5.0|I believe that Steven Spielberg's original &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; is the ultimate dinosaur flick. It is a truly &#34;fun&#34; movie experience from start to finish. And evidently a bunch of other folks agree with me, because &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; earned approximately 357-Million dollars at the box office after premiering in movie theaters on June 11, 1993, placing the film in the Top 10 of all-time money-makers in motion-picture history (as of this writing, the film ranked #10).<br /><br />Spielberg was making &#34;Jurassic&#34; at precisely the same time he was also directing the emotionally-draining &#34;Schindler's List&#34;, which is a film that would go on to win the 1993 &#34;Best Picture&#34; Academy Award. Talk about a large workload! But Mr. Spielberg seemed to thrive on this juggling act of making two pictures at virtually the same time. And both movies came out in fine shape too, a fact which is backed up by the accolades (and huge box-office numbers) each movie garnered. (&#34;Schindler's&#34; earned just under $100-Million at the U.S. box office; and approximately $321-Million in worldwide release.)<br /><br />The personal storylines that were written for &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; are a smidge on the weak side, true. But that doesn't really matter all that much in the final analysis -- because the movie is so much fun otherwise! And the choice of actor Jeff Goldblum to play the part of &#34;Dr. Ian Malcolm&#34; was the best casting decision made for the whole picture, in my view. He adds a lot of humor to the film.<br /><br />I've liked Mr. Goldblum in everything I've ever seen him in; and the &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; films are no exception (he reprised his role as &#34;Ian&#34; in the second &#34;Jurassic&#34; picture as well). His dry humor and easy-going style come across nicely in this film. Such as his humorous line: &#34;Yeah, I'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.&#34; And, of course, THE funniest moment in the movie, when Ian/Jeff utters the hilarious line of dialogue that I've used as the title of this review (after narrowly escaping a rather large predator in a high-speed chase). LOL!  :-)<br /><br />Plus, yet another witty Goldblum-ism (reacting to a disappointing dinosaur-less tour of the park): &#34;Now, John, you will eventually be having DINOSAURS on your dinosaur tour, right? Right?&#34; :)<br /><br />Mr. Spielberg blends a great deal of comedy in with what should be a major calamity --&#62; dinosaurs coming back to life and running free, spreading death and destruction! Sounds pretty serious, right? Well, it is -- but Spielberg manages to lighten up this scenario skillfully, with several humorous scenes. Besides the aforementioned funny Jeff Goldblum moments, there's also &#34;The Guy On The Toilet Meets Dino&#34; scene; as well as the nerdish computer programmer (played nicely by Wayne Knight), who gets way more than he's bargained for in the end.<br /><br />The great John Williams composed the music score for &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; -- and it fits the movie like a glove. I don't know how Mr. Williams keeps doing it, coming up with first-rate musical scores for film after film -- but he does. Amazing.<br /><br />This Universal Studios single-disc &#34;Collector's Edition&#34; DVD of &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; offers up great picture and sound -- via a full and booming Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack and a handsome Widescreen (1.85:1) Anamorphic video transfer. Those pre-historic beasts really &#34;come alive&#34; while watching this DVD.<br /><br />A generous helping of Special Features is dished out by Universal, too -- with the top prize in the package being the very informative behind-the-movie documentary featurette, &#34;The Making Of Jurassic Park&#34; (hosted by James Earl Jones). Mr. Spielberg has lots of on-camera time during this eye-opening featurette, explaining much of the creative work that went into getting this film to the movie screen.<br /><br />This Making-Of program throws the viewer right into the center of Steven Spielberg's movie-making process. Included are many details about the computer-generated effects, which were quite new and untested in the motion-picture industry at the time of the film's production in late 1992 and 1993, making &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; a true pioneering film in many &#34;CGI&#34; ways.<br /><br />Other bonus items on the disc include: An &#34;animatics&#34; feature, storyboards, production photographs, design sketches and paintings, theatrical trailers, DVD-ROM stuff, a &#34;Dinosaur Encyclopedia&#34;, and some cast-&-crew text notes.<br /><br />Additional Data Concerning This DVD .....................<br /><br />&#62; French language soundtrack included (in Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround).<br /><br />&#62; Subtitles in Spanish.<br /><br />&#62; Running Time for Main Feature = 2 hrs., 7 min.<br /><br />&#62; MPAA Rating -- PG-13.<br /><br />&#62; Any Paper Insert(s)? -- Yes, a 4-page mini-booklet, with some behind-the-scenes pics and a Chapter List (20 total scene selections).<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />Parting Jurassic Thoughts ...................<br /><br />There's a certain &#34;magic&#34; that emanates from &#34;Jurassic Park #1&#34; -- with its three main ingredients for success (and fun) being: Director Steven Spielberg, John Williams' terrific score, and those first-of-their-kind computer-generated images that we see on screen, which make the dinosaurs seem, almost literally -- alive!<br /><br />The &#34;Jurassic&#34; sequels that were released in 1997 and 2001 were, IMO, okay films in their own right.

B00066N8JS|5.0|I still can't believe that it was ten years ago that this epic of an industrial masterpiece came out.  To this day, it remains a very popular album that people can never get enough of.  It's classic Nine Inch Nails that can never be duplicated, no matter how hard one tries.  It's angry, depressing, violent, disturbing and beautiful.  So, how do you celebrate the 10 year anniversary of this fine album?  You re-release it... and use all of your powers to make it sound better than ever before.<br /><br />That was accomplished with \\"The Downward Spiral: The Deluxe Edition.\\"  All of the songs are here, and they have each been remastered so you can listen to these classic songs in a whole new way.  It was a little hard to notice at first, since I was listening to it through my headphones, but once I blasted this thing through my speakers, I could immediately hear--no,FEEL--the change and improvement.  You hear little subtle things that you could never pick up on in the original, as there's always a lot going on with each and every one of these songs.  It was like listening to the album for the very first time.  I can't even begin to express how impressed I am with it in words.<br /><br />To take full advantage of this album, it is true that you should have an SACD CD player and surround sound so you can hear it in 5.1, and it is AMAZING.  You really feel like each song is a living and breathing thing waiting to suck you up without warning.  However, if you don't have an SACD CD player, do not fret.  This thing still sounds INCREDIBLE without it.  If you have a great sound system and some high quality speakers, you will definitely hear the difference.  Heck, you can even pop this thing into your discman, then put in the older version, and you will be able to note the difference as well.<br /><br />Not only is this remastered to its highest quality, but you also get a bonus CD that offers 13 tracks of rare remixes, demos and songs that only appeared in soundtracks, such as \\"dead souls\\" (from \\"The Crow\\") and \\"burn\\" (\\"Natural Born Killers).  The remixes are ones that you can find on various single releases, but it's nice to have them all on one CD.  Not only that, but you get the demos of \\"ruiner,\\" \\"liar (reptile demo)\\" and \\"heresy.\\"<br /><br />If you're a NIN fanatic like me, then you MUST pick this up immediately!  You won't regret it.  Still hang onto the original release (since you're a NIN fan!), but trust me, you will be listening to this Deluxe Version instead.  Nine Inch Nails' \\"The Downward Spiral: The Deluxe Version\\" does NOT disappoint.  Its new sound is simply unbelievable.  What a way to celebrate ten great years.  A re-release to remember. -Michael Cranech as \\"dead souls\\" (from \\"The Crow\\") and \\"burn\\" (\\"Natural Born Killers).

0553573403|5.0|Easily the most stunning, realistic, and fantastic book I've ever read. Characters are rediculously well crafted and the story reads really fast. The best fantasy series available at the moment. The only one who even comes close is Steven Erikson and his Tale of the Malazan Book of the Fallen. George R. R. Martin is the master of modern fantasy.
B00004SZWB|5.0|Here is Stevie Wonder's initial project for the 1980's. This album was released in or around September 1980. According to Norm N. Nite's Rock On Almanac,MASTER BLASTER debuted on the radio that month. Wonder did not have hits at all earlier that year. I like I AIN'T GONNA STAND FOR IT which was later covered by Eric Clapton. I heard several songs on Music Choice's Classic R&B channel. One of them was ALL I DO. Anyway,it's a very good album. This is one of five albums that Wonder released in the 80's.

0141301104|5.0|You complain that this books bring stereotypes about your craft into the mind of the reader. Need I remind you that this is a children's book and children usually don't care for the craft or know about it either way to begin with. This is also a good thing that it scares them away from dabbling in that stuff, becuase they are too young to mess with those forces to begin with. And um HELLO? There have been stories of wicked witches forever and friggin' ever and unless a wiccan goes around wearing gloves and offering out candy bars then little kids won't be scared. OMG I just thought of something, that's discriminative to those little old ladies that wear gloves and offer out hard candies on the bus, let's all get together and revolt and nagg people's ears off. You guys take yourselves waaaay too seriously. I'm a christian and when someone stereotypes christians I don't care, because I'm secure with myself and me acting like i have mad hippy disease, will not repeat WILL NOT change their minds.

0064407667|3.0|I had never heard of these books until the movie came along.  When I first saw posters and cardboard ads, I had no idea what was going on, but after I saw the first preview, I thought that the movie looked entertaining in a bizzare way.  I talked to my sister, who is 7 years younger than me, and she has read some of the books, and she likes them, but I wasn't sure they were for me, a college student.  As it turned out, my RA had a copy of this book, so he let me borrow it.  After finishing it in an hour (yes, you can get through it that quickly), here are my thoughts. <br />This book, while written at a very low reading level, should NOT be given to young children.  It is very dark (though not as dark as the superior Harry Potter books); it deals with child abuse, death, incompetent adults, as well as a few other disturbing things.  However, I am only warning you, much like the \\"author\\" Lemony Snicket often does.  I would reccomend at least reading this book once if you ever get the chance.  Yes, it was written for children, but there a lot of adult subtexts in the book, and it is as I predicted- entertaining in a very bizzare way. <br />This is the first book in a series of (I think) 13 books in the \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\" series.  The action centers around the three Baudelaire children, the inventor Violet, who is the eldest, the bookworm Klaus, the only boy, and the teething Sunny, who likes to sink her teeth into anyone and everything.  After the sad deaths of their very kind and very rich parents, the Baudelaire orphans are sent to live with their closest (geographically) relative, Count Olaf, an actor by trade.  Sadly, it turns out that Olaf is a greedy child abuser who is only interested in procuring the enormous fortune left behind by the deceased parents.  Basically, Olaf forces the children to do all of his housework, none of which he appreciates, while he plots to steal their riches.  Meanwhile, the children quietly plot an escape.  That's about the extent of the story. <br />Yes, it's true, I did cringe at a few parts, especially the whole wedding thing, which also qualifies as the biggest reason this book should be kept away from young children.  Snicket's constant translations, observations, and warnings are definitely the highlight of the book, but I also enjoyed wondering how the Baudelaire children would solve their current predicament, as well as wondering what would come next. <br />If you do not choose to read this, it is understandable, but for those of you who do read it, I hope you enjoy it as much or more than I did.

B00003CXE7|5.0|Germania  March, AD 180:  Marcus Aurelius' eighteen-year military efforts against eastern and northern tribes have drawn to a close. The Stoic emperor (who in much of the West has come to symbolize the Golden Age of ancient Rome) is passing on, to have the throne occupied by his only living son, Commodus. Marcus actually had little choice in this matter: Either make Commodus the new emperor, or have him executed.  It seems unlikely that the son would have murdered his father, as Commodus was Marcus' named successor, and was already officially a joint emperor.  Once in power as the only rulng Caesar, Commodus led a generally shameless regime. His sister Lucilla did conspire with a few senators to have him assassinated, and when the plot failed, he had the senators executed and his sister banished and then executed. From there, his reign was characterized more or less by viciousness, caprice, and insanity. He renamed Rome the 'Colonia Commodiana' (Colony of Commodus), envisioned himself to be the Greek god Hercules, and entered the arena as a gladiator to fight man and beast. His unpopularity appears to have grown until, when he made known that he intended to instate himself as consul on New Year's Day, 193, several of his advisors conspired to have him murdered. Commodus was strangled by a professional wrestler on the night of 31 December 192. Civil war followed his death.     Much of Ridley Scott's Roman-era epic GLADIATOR wanders into fictional territory, despite the rootedness of a few individuals in actual history. Of course, this is nothing new. From \\"Spartacus\\" to \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" and beyond, studios and producers have used their story-telling talents to expand and explore, creating tapestries that range from very historical to almost entirely (or entirely) nonhistorical.    So why have I given GLADIATOR five stars? Because it works well - very well - on the narrative level! As someone else has suggested, it is not really a biopic. Before the movie premiered in theaters most people on the street would be hard pressed to recount very much about the historical persons involved. Instead, here is a story with interesting characters going through some provocative change and circumstance, in which the two subset stories of (1) Commodus & Lucilla in Rome and (2) Maximus in Africa come together for an almost fate-initiated clash of calculating spite that climaxes in a slave-versus-emperor face-off in the Colosseum (then known as the Flavian Amphitheater). The story exhibits a respectable measure of originality; plot lines are largely not predictable.    The Roman Empire is reaching the zenith of its power and glory, spanning three continents, from Spain to Judea, from the Danube to the Nile. Emperor Marcus Aurelius - having concluded his military campaign against the Germanic barbarians - must now find someone to serve as 'the protector of Rome' (pending the Senate's readiness to rule). He knows his son Commodus is too corrupt for the position, so he appoints his now-favorite general, Maximus Decimus Meridius, for the role. When Marcus Aurelius breaks the news to his hopeful son, Commodus throws a fit, and father tries to comfort only to be suffocated by his scheming progeny. Commodus assumes emperorship, and when Maximus declines to pay homage, the young Caesar orders his execution, and his family's. Maximus foils the attempt on his own life and escapes, but not in time to save his wife and son. Distraught over the loss of his family, the former general is sold into slavery, to be trained as a gladiator. When the trainer learns that 'the games' have been instituted, he - and Gladiator Maximus - head to Rome for an unforgettable matchup.    Sure, Marcus' (and the Senate's) desire to \\"give power back to the people\\" sounds rather modern, as the Roman Senate of 1800-plus years ago was not as 'democratic' as is the United States Senate - though we may label it a few steps toward the idea - and that and other elements enrich thestory, making it more palatable for [modern Western] viewers.    Quality performances by Harris, Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen, and Reed. Other strong appearances by Jacobi and Hounsou add to the appeal. Plus great directing by Ridley Scott (especially during the action sequences), well-positioned cinematography, and a rousing score. For all of its shortcomings in the historical files, GLADIATOR has scope and grandeur.    P.S. For those who wish to learn more, various online sites offer some information about Marcus Aurelius, Commodus (and perhaps Lucilla) and about the world of the time in general, but the best source is probably Encyclopedia Britannica 2004.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I have to agree that this was a great movie in it's entirety, but I was very dissapointed with it. I have to agree with a previous review I read on this site and say that if you are a real HP fan, you would not care how long the movie is. I dont understand why this was the longest book in the series yet it was the shortest movie. Too much time was wasted on parts that are for one thing, not even in the book, and two, wasted on scenery. TOO many changes were made to this movie when compared to the other 2. The buildings were changed, the location of buildings and trees were changed. Understandable that the plots get darker and darker but the first 2 movies were so much more engaging. They had a mystical sense about them that made you want to see more.. (another point of the 3rd I didnt like, the kids were dressed in jeans and jackets, bla bla bla..) I mean I thought they would end up in a GAP ad or soemthing. I will admit here and now I was not a HP fan in the least when the series blew up and became a huge hit, but the first time I saw the first HP movie on HBO or something I absolutely fell in love with the series. I now own all three movies and the 1st 5 books.  <br />I guess it is different if you have not read the books and saw the azkaban movie because in essence you don't really know what is missing, but if you are a fan of the 1st two movies by director chris columbus you know how some of us feel. <br /> <br />So with that in mind, I hope this NEW director takes into consideration that real fans do not care how long the movies are as long as they follow the book and capture the fantasy that is Harry Potter. For all those out there that have no seen this movie, give it a go. Even if it's not at the top of my list, it's still a great movie to see and share.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Where do I start?  Well, this film is nothing short of a classic.  The fact that it has made an everlasting impact on our culture since the films release in 1967 and stood the test of time is on it's own amazing.  The fact that people are still talking about this movie thirty some years later speaks for itself.  And it's odd that this film that was perhaps looked at by some as a B-movie due to it's dubbing of italian into english and is now looked at as high art.  Everything from the acting to the directing to the truly amazing musical themes throughout is truly stunning.  The set pieces still look pretty good for how old it is too.  I like that I can watch this film and feel the sense of adventure... that's my favorite thing about it.  It has that same sense of excitement as perhaps an Indiana Jones film.  It's an epic that takes place in many different locations as the characters cross throughout the Southwest(actually Italy...spaghetti westerns)And it is an adventure in watching them do so.  This movie has inspired the likes of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and most certainly Quentin Tarantino especially seen in Kill Bill vol.2(I think he even used some of Ennio Morricone's music from this film in his.)  As for the dvd, it's loaded to the brim with extras.  My favorite was the one where they showed the difficulty in restoring the film...that one is pretty cool!  The added fifteen minutes of footage don't really add a whole lot to the picture but it is nice to see the directors true vision finally come to life with this release.  Sergio Leone was a true genius!
B000002LUB|5.0|After several so-so album releases carrying the name of Black Sabbath, we long-time fans FINALLY get a CD with the 'Heaven & Hell' line-up intact. Even though the 'Mob Rules' lp was good, I would say that technically this record COULD be 'Heaven & Hell' follow-up, easily. Very well done, guys. I've heard several fans (like myself) comment that Ronnie James Dio's vocals on this record simply never sounded better, in Sabbath, Dio nor Rainbow for that matter. Not sure if I'd totally agree with that, but rest assure, 'Dehumanizer' is a great reunion effort. Only downfall is I personally doubt this CD did as good as the label Warner Bros. or the band had hoped for. Notice that both guitarist Tony Iommi and bassist Geezer Butler's overall playing here is outstanding too. Tracks that truly pull the listener in are \\"Time Machine\\", \\"After All\\", \\"TV Crimes\\" (still see the video for this song on Headbanger's Ball now and again), \\"Computer God\\", the Dio-like \\"Letters From Earth\\" and \\"Buried Alive\\". Enjoy this disc as I've met Dio himself TWICE now while catching him out on tour and he's mention to me that he'd NEVER reunite with Sabbath again because this CD marked the second time he was 'burned' by the other members. Sad, but at least fans got a 'final' chapter in the saga. Wouldn't it be great if this line-up would sometime do the annual Ozzfest summer tour instead of Ozzy? Just a thought. Recommended.    May, 2010 footnote: Dio, myself as well as many fans of your lengthy career will truly miss you. R.I.P. Ronnie James Dio.
B0006399FS|4.0|I will start by saying that the song \\"Vertigo\\" hurt U2's chances in my book of selling me a CD.  I was unimpressed and worried about what else I might find.  Because I am a fan, I bought the album anyways to find out what else U2 had to offer.    What I found was simply amazing.  There are songs and melodies which evoke memories of my favorite album--The Unforgettable Fire.  (Also I believe produced by Steve Lillywhite).    How?  U2 (if you have seen them live) has a certain intimacy and vulnerability that is unmatched by any band I have ever heard.  They also have an ability to combine lyrics and sonic qualities to evoke imagery, and emotion.    So why the \\"deep and dark\\" comment?    Musically this is not the best album they have put together, but from a sheer sonic and lyrical standpoint it deserves more respect than it will get.    Track 10 evokes memories of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (a Bowie anthem) and adds an even better line:  \\"Ill give you everything that you want, except the thing that you want.\\"      Is the song about a groupie, or simply an inability to commit to one woman?  Not sure but then its even more puzzling when the song states \\"you are the first one of your kind.\\"      The point being, these are some very heavy and serious lyrics and the music and singing evoke a very deep dark place (perhaps its the ballad of the aging rock star).  \\"Some things you shouldn't get too good at, like smiling, crying, and celebrity...some people have too much confidence baby...\\"    Another song which has an amazing sonic quality (combined with lyrics) is Track 5.  \\"So Beautiful..tonight.\\"  The guitar line that follows simply sings...what its humming is up to you to decide.   Similarly, the lyric goes \\"i miss you when you are not around...I am about to leave the ground...\\" and then with a sonic rush the swirling guitars, drum, bass and humming evokes thoughts of someone taking off in a jet off the runway at LAX.  Is Bono simply singing about a City heloves? Or is he singing about his own life?  I'd like to know.    I also detect a theme that smells of someone who is going through marital troubles, perhaps even heading for divorce.  The songs evoke at times a passionate love affair that is tempted by the world outside the relationship.  \\"The Mysterious Distance..\\" is but one of these tunes.    I won't describe each song but suffice to say, this album could be U2's \\"Swan Song.\\"  I hope not, but the album seems to evoke thoughts of \\"looking back\\" over their career, the women, the songs, the music, the passion and even has some familiar melodies and overtones from past songs.  On purpose?  Perhaps.    Only time will tell.  Enjoy the music of one of the great bands of this generation.

0780631684|5.0|FINAL DESTINATION is one of my favourite films because it was completely original... death following you not a typical slasher.... this is the first movie i was shocked and appauld by...in the middle of the movie, i had to walk out of the theater and one point... this movie changed the game of all horror flicks....<br /><br />the sequel is a great one too... it is as shocking as the first but this one takes the cake....<br /><br />all i can say i will never look at airplanes the same ever....<br /><br />5 stars out of 5
B00006879E|1.0|I was unpleasantly surprised the the average rating for this CD was so high.  Let me be blunt-this music is just disgusting.  \\"She Will Be Loved,\\" is just annoying, I'm ashamed that these guys are even associated with the rock genre.  I guess this is what people listen to today-which is really pretty sad.  If you like pop and all of that, you'll probably enjoy this album.  On the other hand, if you like good music, the kind that doesn't make you want to throw yourself in front of a moving train, stay away from this one.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|People have been criticising this album since its release without ever looking at it in the context of DT's progression as a band and the diversity of their albums thus far. TOT has been criticised for being \\"too metal\\" and too heavy and it is something the and have just had to get out of their system. Yes, as far as progressive sensibilities go, this is an inferior album, but it should nevertheless be enjoyed for what it is, an obviously very talented band who have just branched further into the realm of metal. The new album is already said by Rudess to be much more progressive and that with TOT out of the way, they can now concentrate on making more traditionally progressive music. Musically speaking, i actually very much enjoyed this album, say what you will about the extreme heaviness, Petrucci's credo as a guitarist has always been melody first and he has not broken it on this album. Both Petrucci and Rudess do very technically demanding as well as awe-inspiring riffs and solo lines,just listen to them synchronising on \\"In the Name of God.\\" \\"Stream of consciousness\\" is another great instrumental piece, i have to say i had this album for about 3 months before i gave it any real thought, i was grossly unimpressed with the first few listens but after a few listens i began to appreciate not just the demanding instrument wizadry of the four musicians, but also their ability to maintain their intricacy within a very metal environment. DT fans buy this album, if you don't, then it's not in the true vein of being a DT fan and you're doing a disservice to yourself if you don't give this album time and go into it with an open mind.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This fantasy/concept album is brilliant.  The melodies are so catchy and rock hard as well.  I'm not a Tolkien fan at all...never read LOTR or Simarillion.  But I love love love this type of metal.  This is my first exposure to Blind Guardian and I will defnitely be picking up more albums as well as the Demons and Wizard project.
0393035158|5.0|Let's play a game.  In this game, let's pretend that there is a plague that has been sweeping through most of mankind's history, unchecked, for millennia.  Let's say that this pestilence, this infection, has broken out in all parts of the world, in both large and small infestations, and note that it is always specifically, and relentlessly, targeted toward the wiping out of entire societies and ethnic groups.  Let's say that the cause of this plague, though known, is never spoken of, is never acknowledged, and it is absolutely never attacked except by equally virulent diseases. Let us assume, for this paper, that the symptoms of this disease are war and genocide and that the causal agent for these infections is, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde' \\"The hate that dare not speak its name.\\"  But here, in this book, The End of Faith, Sam Harris has the courage and the insight to speak its name.  Its name is faith, its name is religion. We come to understand that the events of 9/11, far from being an act of war, were an act of faith-of perfect faith, justified and sanctified by fundamentalist faith.  The question Mr. Harris asks us to consider is whether it is acceptable, or even sane, to tolerate such religious beliefs, beliefs that inevetably lead to bloody conflict, in this nuclear age?  A must read!
B00005B36H|3.0|Tool is a band with talented members. That is something you cannot deny. They are the type of band that I would like to listen to without too many bells and whistles. However, they've overdone it on Lateralus. It seems that they've sacrificed musical heart and soul for the sake of trying to upstage every single tidbit and nuance in the making of music, and then putting it all in one disc.<br /><br />Lateralus is an enigmatic phenomenon of an album. It has all the makings of a masterpiece. Tool took up a new logo and visual style, the breadth of their music has ventured further into another realm, and the approach to the album's packaging is quite innovative. The percussion has improved and the instrumentation has become more complex. It's a technical marvel. But with all these virtues, Lateralus is too ambitious for its own good. Considering the maxed-out duration of the album, you can't help but take notice that the band tried to outdo Aenima here by further using up a disc's full capacity. Do we really need tracks like Mantra, Parabol, or Faaip De Oaid taking up space on the album for \\"artsy\\" and/or \\"spiritual\\" purposes? Do we really need long, droning progressions throughout the album to make songs more elaborate and \\"intelligent\\"? Lateralus feels too rehearsed, calculated, and excessive for someone to get an organic listening experience out of it.<br /><br />Listening to this album end-to-end, it's obvious that Tool went for the \\"atmospheric\\" musical approach. The Jewish/Mid-East structure that holds Lateralus together fits Tool's style, but it is misused in a self-indulgent way. It works here and there, especially in parts of the trilogy at the end, but most of the time it comes off as willful and cheesy. That's sad, because when Tool shines, things work. There are two tracks that stand out: The Grudge and Reflection. While these are long songs, not a single second is wasted. They durate, relax, contract, and conclude perfectly. The musicianship on both are excellent. However, the rest of Lateralus is forced and tries too hard to be unique. It screams pretention. The two singles that came off the album (Schism and Parabola) are in no way worthy of succeeding Stinkfist or Aenema. Something \\"new and different\\" does not always constitute for the better, at least for Tool in Lateralus.<br /><br />I really don't know how the excessive veneration of this band came to be. It's ridiculous and annoying. Those people out there who praise this band as some unearthly force whose music are reserved only for intelligent listeners are in over their heads. Tool is a band of great musicians who are okay musical visionaries. That is all. And that \\"think for yourself, question authority\\" statement is a tad bit cliched, childish, and cheesy.<br /><br />In the end, Lateralus is still a better album than most things on the market, but if you want to hear good Tool, try Undertow or Aenima. These were the days when Tool had something significant to say on every track without falling into the abyss of being pretentious and self-indulgent.er, the rest of Lateralus is forced and tries too hard to be unique.

B0006399FS|1.0|U2 has been my favorite band for about the past 10 years.  Achtung Baby is still my favorite album, and I couldn't wait until HTDAAB was released so U2 could dominate the music world once more.  Much to my disappointment, U2 should throw in the towel.  Every album is released with words such as \\"U2 have reinvented themselves and the Edge has rediscovered the guitar.\\"  The guitar is sad, the songs drag on, and Bono's voice and lyrics have fallen from greatness.  This album is so boring, it doesn't sound like U2 even care about making music anymore. They just need a lot of overly-dedicated fans to give them too much money and inflate thier already enormous egos.
B00062ZE44|5.0|This album will appeal to fans of Within Temptation, Evanesence, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish and anything similar. The current album is absolutely fantastic, thus far I have listened about 10 times and it gets better each time for the uninaugurated it's a mix of Rock (not too heavy), Full Orchestra and Operatic and powerful style from Ballads to full on anthems - you can hear every word that is sung and it leaves you with a good feeling of money well spent. Earlier Albums from 'Within Temptation' - 'Mother Earth' just don't cut it for me, this is their finest yet I really can't wait to see them tour. I purchased on the premise of 'Stand My Ground' They're a Dutch band and have gone about a few changes musically for the better I think. Stand out tracks are 'Stand My Ground' 'Memories' and 'Aquarius' buy the enhanced version and you get the equally as good 'The Swan Song' and 'A dangerous Mind'
B000077VT7|5.0|I expected the usual action-film hash with this one.  Instead, I found myself watching a good old '50's style Spy Who Came In From The Cold style movie.  It's elegant.  Best lines:  \\"Are you the guy from Paris?  Do you get the headaches too?\\"  Poignant.  And the movie answers Freud's question:  \\"What do women want?\\"  They want what Matt Damon gives -- backrubs, messing with our hair, and listening to us talk.  Talk about sexy.  And watching Damon's portrayal of confusion and rage, not knowing who the heck he is, is just fun.  The Brat Pack gets better every movie.
B00004YZ36|5.0|G&eacute;za Anda's interpretations of Mozart's piano concertos are immortal classics that should not be overlooked. Granted, it is a crowded field, which include many excellent accounts (Perahia's, for example). But these recordings - made in Salzburg - are fine examples of the rare moments in music making when a soloist and ensemble forms a coherent unit. Anda and his Salzburger team know Mozart by heart, and they perform these works with an unmatched dedication and sophistication. Technical brilliance is not the ultimate goal here; it is rather the music itself, how to let it flow with a balanced passion. This keeps the element of spontaneity, so crucial in Mozart's music, alive and sparkling.<br /><br />Anda's Mozart is thus never dull, which occasionally is the case with Brendel's or Perahia's. In his hands, each phrase is given attention, vitality, and expressive nuance. As a result, it is a sheer delight to listen to all the 27 concertos for the (almost) ten hours it takes.<br /><br />So far for the interpretations. Regarding recording quality, these recordings were made in the sixties at a time when the DG engineers really couldn't compete with, say Decca or HMV. The recordings are thus a bit dry, even if the remasterings are excellent. But do not let this very minor shortcoming prevent you from experience these outstanding interpretations.<br /><br />To sum up: this set is strongly recommended for any music collector. Mozart's piano concertos have never been more attractively presented than in the hands of Anda.
B0002MB7R6|2.0|Don't you hate it when a perfectly good, brainless action movie suddenly goes so awfully bad, sloppy and poor that it just ruins the rest of the flick for you?  This is a very dumb movie, but the special effects are a delight, and we were having such a good time watching them when -- the wolves showed up.  Okay.  Poorly animated.  Typical Red-Riding Hood vicious.  No clue on the part of the writers that a trio of tame zoo wolves would see people as part of their pack -- and probably alpha members of that pack -- rather than as food.  And why would wolves bother eating live people when there were piles of dead human flesh all over the place?  These domestic howls would have been more likely to run up to the humans they found with their tails and heads down, whimpering, \\"Feed us!  Feed us!\\"  And the wolf animation was... well, in 1987, it would have been forgiveable.  But now?  There's no excuse for this sort of second-string slop.  I really do take it personally when a film obviously sniffs, \\"Well, that's good enough for YOU -- you don't know any better.\\"  We were frankly offended by having the rest of a perfectly good rotten action movie ruined for us.  It was worse than if the film had been bad from the beginning.  And our library spent perfectly good money to buy this clunker!  Pft.
B00030590I|5.0|So I can't understand why every needs to run on and on about this being a propagandist film?  It's a period piece.  It's meant to describe the time it's set in.  It's entertainment.  It's a film for you to simply enjoy.  If I want to watch something about propaganda I'll just put on any US war movie or the Fox news channel.  You think that's not propaganda? <br /> <br />Anyway... Hero is superb.  If you like intense martial arts... wonderfully shot visuals... and great editing... this is a film you will like.  Set aside these politcal judgements and enjoy the film for what it really is at the core.  Martial way... art... love... paced at a deliberate slower pace because it's simply awesome to watch.
B0006284JQ|4.0|Although as of late Britney Spears seems to have a fairer share of detractors than admirers, it cannot be denied that \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\" is a non-stop collection of golden sass that is easy to listen to and difficult to turn off; exactly what pop music is supposed to be.<br /><br />Despite the fact that they made most of us pound our fists down in frustration when the airwaves were satiated with them, hits from her first two multi-platinum albums now sound like old friends who bring back so many memories. Whether or not anyone likes it, DJs are going to be playing the likes of \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" and \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" at parties and weddings for decades to come for the simple fact that they are outstandingly crafted bubblegum.<br /><br />As a result of being a particularly small-voiced performer, one consequence throughout her career has been a lack of ballads and mid-tempo tracks. However, her three most notorious, the Dido-penned \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,\\" the ever-cutesy \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"Everytime\\" give the listener a few breathing moments amongst the overall fast-paced disc. The latter, however, is a perfect example of how the general public can be manipulated. Understood to reveal lasting affection for ex-flame Justin Timberlake when it was released to radio, it had been recorded and released months prior on her \\"In the Zone\\" album before she quickly married and divorced another man in Las Vegas.<br /><br />In addition to more hits, new material is included. \\"My Prerogative,\\" her smart Bobby Brown cover, while only a minor hit, is the perfect song for her to have recorded at this time given its message that takes on personal meaning for her. \\"Do Somethin',\\" sounds like an old B-side that was thrown into this collection, on the other hand, while \\"(I've Only Just Begun) Having My Fun,\\" can stand proudly with her past hits.<br /><br />Notably making its first appearance on a Spears release is the Co-Ed Remix of \\"Boys\\" featuring Pharrell Williams which was originally included only on the soundtrack to \\"Austin Powers In Goldmember.\\" Furthermore, included with the initial pressing of the set to seal the deal is a disc with 5 club-ready tracks, with Armand Van Helden's club mix of \\"Toxic\\" taking top honors. The Hi-Bias Radio Mix of \\"Everytime\\" also gives the song a splendid euro-dance vibe, while Chris Cox's Megamix features a quick run through of many of the hits.<br /><br />Even though it has only been six years since she burst onto the pop music scene, Spears has certainly amassed a lion's share of notorious hit singles, making \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\" is a testament to not only Spears' heyday, but to turn of the century pop itself.Williams which was originally included only on the soundtrack to \\"Austin Powers In Goldmember.\\" Furthermore, included with the initial pressing of the set to seal the deal is a disc with 5 club-ready tracks, with Armand Van Helden's club mix of \\"Toxic\\" taking top honors.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|I went to see this film when it came to my local theater.  From the reviews I figured this would be like revenge of the nerds.  What I got was the [...] film I have seen in my entire life.    I normally would like this type movie.  I loved all four Revenge of the Nerds films, but this was in my opinion a complete bomb.  From the opening credits all the way to about twenty minutes from the end of the movie the movie sucked it didn't get better until about twenty minutes from the end when the major plot portion of the film finally was brought into view.  The rest of the movie was [...]I am a person who typically likes almost any movie but this film was terrible.  [...]  Don't waste your hard earned money on this [...]!
0375507256|5.0|If you are reading this, you must be trying to decide if \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is worth buying and reading. This is where I was a few weeks ago. Influenced by the National Public Radio interview with Daniel Mitchell, I decided to take the chance. Thank you NPR. It is a thoughtful,provacative and entertaining read. Some of the chapters present a challenge (An Orison of Sonmi and Sloosha's Crossing and Everything After), but this adds to the intriguing nature of the stories. This book is well worth it.
B00005JMAH|5.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is destine to be a movie buff classic. If you purchased the first two Harry Potter film series, then \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" must also be included. How can you leave this film out?  If you are Harry Potter fan, then this DVD is already in your collection. Reviews will only further the controversy between book and film.<br /><br />\\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is cutting a fine edge between any age family movie and teenager plus movie. As Harry grows up his audience must grow with him. Unfortunately this leaves the younger kids out. \\"The Prisoner\\" gets more into the scary, horror genre with the black robed Dementors. If I met a Dementor I would be scared to death. Just thinking about that scenario scares me and I'm middle aged.<br /><br />\\"The Prisoner\\" sets up the next step in the Harry Potter series, hopefully as a PG rating and not a PG-13. I would like to see a G rating for the entire series. But as Harry learns his craft he will encounter more black witches, dark warlords and horror characters. The detailed Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, well thought out characters, scenery and plot is courtesy of J. K. Rowling's imaginary mind.<br /><br />I have only seen the Harry Potter films. I think by not reading the Harry Potter books I am not inclined to scrutinized and compare inaccuracies with the movies. I just enjoy the films as entertainment. For two hours or more I can divulge myself into an outstanding, well-filmed movie. I can experience all the joy, excitement, anticipation, teaching and learning with friends and well-know character(s).<br /><br />Films and books are for enjoyment. The time frame and journey to the end is up to the individual. This DVD will be added to my collection; filed under ENJOY!
B0002F6BRE|4.0|I thought this movie looked inane when it hit the theatres last season. I poo pooed people I knew plunking down their hard earned money even for a bargain matinee.<br /><br />This year I overheard it playing in the DVD player when my children  were watching - after the third or fourth time hearing lines like \\"I like to smile, smiling is my favorite!\\" followed by a stern, \\"No it's not, from now on work is your favorite.\\"..... well, let's just say the Christmas Spirit was having its way with me.<br /><br />Buddy is the only human who has ever been to the North Pole.  His arrival was perhaps due to the Nun at the orphanage, invoking a sacred \\"Maybe by next Christmas you will have a home.\\"  In  waltzes Santa, who somehow misses little baby Buddy climbing into his sack while he was nibbling a cookie left by very generous (believing) Nuns.<br /><br />He finally finds out he is not an Elf and is sent by his \\"adoptive\\" father, Papa Elf, to the \\"Magical City of New York\\" to find his father.<br /><br />James Caan is priceless as Buddy's birth father - and while there are some rather predictable moments, there are also some very surprising, wonderful, engagingly \\"isn't this what life should be like?\\" moments.<br /><br />An example of a silly-yet-so-pure moment was when Buddy walked by a restaurant in \\"Magical New York City\\" and saw a sign that declared, \\"World's Best Coffee\\".  He could not contain himself - he had to go inside and celebrate with the folks inside.<br /><br />\\"Congratulations!\\" his voice boomed. I laughed and laughed and laughed. How often do we take that sort of hyperbole for granted, yawning our way through life? That just wouldn't work for Buddy. He likes to sing loud, laugh loud, cut out snowflakes and, in his authenticity, appear to others (like his long lost father) \\"certifiably insane.\\"<br /><br />Until watching \\"Elf\\" I had never seen Will Farrell at work.  (I am obviously not SNL literate these days.) I really appreciate what I saw from him.<br /><br />About the bonuses - the Sing Along was great and the menu choices are wonderfully engaging, but the instructions frustrated my daughter. She still hasn't figured out how to play some of the games which makes her quite frustrated.im. <br /> <br />About the bonuses - the Sing Along was great and the menu choices are wonderfully engaging, but the instructions frustrated my daughter.

B00005JMAH|5.0|I have to admit it--I am part of the crowd that prefers this movie to the first two. And yes, I am a complete Harry Potter book addict, and I still enjoyed this movie immensely. Some reviewers have complained that it's too \\"real\\", but that's what I really liked about it. Parts of it that were more realistic just made the magical parts seem even truer and intense. The drama was great and I loved a lot of the cinematography. I realize that there are some logical inconsistencies (the one that bothers me the most is the part where Harry uses magic at the very beginning of the movie, at Privet Drive--what the heck?!?), and that much of the book was left out and that bothers some hardcore HP fans, but I am about as hardcore as they get and I really didn't mind. I thought that despite these inaccuracies the movie was really well done. Though some key plot points were left out, the movie does a fantastic job of getting across the general message and tone of the book, and I think that's definitely more important. Of course you can still read the books to get all the details--that's what they're for. But as far as a movie adaptation of The Prisoner of Azkaban, I really thought this was great. I heard that Alfonso Cuaron isn't doing any more HP movies and I'm disappointed.
B000088DTS|5.0|I've been a delta goodrem fan and it was this album that made me an immortal fan! for those of you who dont know much about this tall Australia, there is more to this 20-year than meets the eye (the INNOCENT eye, rather). In a little over 8 months, this album went platnium 14 times, and became the second highest selling album in australia's history and contains 5 tracks that went to number one (most of them debuted). For her efforts on the album Delta then went on to win a record-smashing 7 ARIAS (its the australian equivelant to the Grammys). But there's more still. Delta achieved all these milestones while battling cancer, a rare form Hodgkin's Disease. Down, but certainly not out, Delta proved that anything is achievable regardless of the situation. <br /> <br />this brings me to the album itself. it is filled with beautiful, up-beat songs that encourage the listener to simply sing with all her heart. there is a wonderful balance of ballads and pop songs, all of which were either wrote, or co-wrote by delta herself. let's not go any further without making mention of her voice. it's like an angel. there's a tone in her voice that just melts the heart, it is one of the most pure and heavenly voices in the business. <br /> <br />now i'll give a brief track-by-track description of the cd! <br /> <br />1) Born to Try <br />this was the song that introduced Delta as a singer. It's inspirational and truly uplifting. Delta also reaches a seemingly impossible high note that just makes you yearn for such a brilliant voice. It was Delta's first number one hit! 10/10 <br /> <br />2)Innocent Eyes <br />the covetted track, innocent eyes was the third single to reach number 1. this is definately my favourite off the album. its got beautiful lyrics and melodically is the most original. the piano and vocals co-oridnate perfectly <br />10/10 <br /> <br />3)Not Me No I <br />this was the first single to be released after the news of Delta's illness. The film clip showed a thinner,paler delta, but also underlined just how determined this girl is to keep going. it is a beautiful ballad with wonderful lyrics and was the fourth single to reach the number one spot. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />4)Throw it Away <br />this is the most differnt song off the album, as it has a very jazzy rhythm and melody to it. it's my least favourite off the track (hey! you've gotta have one no matter how much you like an album!) but its still a great song to listen to if you're in the mood for an upbeat track! <br />6/10 <br /> <br />5)Lost Without You <br />The second song to reach number one, Lost Without You is truly beautiful and is my second favourite off the album! Although, delta didnt write this song, it certainly is one of her best. beautiful harmonies, and clever piano work into simple and effective lyrics to create a simply beautiful track to lsiten too. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />6) Predictable <br />This is the rock song of the album, revealing a never-before-heard feisty delta. its got big sound and excellent piano parts with fun lyrics to belt out. this was the fifth and final single to be released and to reach the number one spot. it was also delta's longest stay in the number one position of the album <br />10/10 <br /> <br />7) Butterfly <br />i'm sure that if delta had opted for one more track to release it would have definately been this one. this is one of the most beautiful and inspirational songs i have ever heard. absolutely stunning vocals are the main feature in this song along with its unique melody. simply stunning <br />9/10 <br /> <br />8)In My Own Time <br />Another ballad and a significant part of the song is just with delta and her piano. the melody is uplifting and fantastic! <br />7/10 <br /> <br />9) My Big Mistake <br />This is a more of a poppy song of Delta's. It's lots of fun and great if you're just in the mood to play with your voice in front of the CD player! <br />7/10 <br /> <br />10) This is Not Me <br />This is my second least favourite track, only because the melody doesn't really grab me. Delta's vocals are still flawless however. <br />6/10 <br /> <br />11) Running Away <br />There was something about this simple little song that just made me fall in love with it. It's another poppy song but has a little spice to it. It's SOO much fun to sing and the melody along with cute harmonies are just fantastic! it's definately a favourite of mine. I love it! <br />10/10 <br /> <br />12) A Year Ago Today <br />A beautiful ballad that delta actually co-wrote a few years before she became famous. it's a bittersweet theme of rememberance and is a beautiful song lyrically to listen to. you mind even have a tear in your eye! <br />8/10 <br /> <br />13) Longer <br />I haven't really listened to this song as much as i probably should, but its still a great song! the melody is fun and free-spirited and the lyrics are great. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />14) Will You Fall For Me <br />Delta wrote this beautiful ballad and is a stunning song with gorgeous vocals. It's a very simple song as there's just her and the piano in this one and is a perfect way to finish off the album <br />7/10 <br /> <br /> <br />So inconclusion, Delta Goodrem is truly a brilliant singer/songwriter. so much devotion and effort has been put into this record and it really pays off for delta! With a wonderful, balanced mix of jazz, pop, ballads and contempary song, Innocent Eyes is innocently brilliant and point Delta's eyes on the road for success! <br /> <br />A+!
B000092Q4U|5.0|This is an amazing album, I just bought it today and although I had heard Ruin & 11th Hour a few times the thing that suprised me is the fact that Lamb of God managed to keep the intensity up throughout the whole album.<br /><br />The guitar work is amazing, being a guitarist myself I can respect just how much work they have put into the album. The screaming vocals are amazing, I honestly don't know how he manages to keep going with vocals like that, I'd lose my voice after the first song! The drums are not as stand out as the guitar and vocals but certainly very respectable. The only minor criticism i have is the length of the album; at 38 mins and 4 seconds, it could probably do with another 10 or 15 mins on it...
B00005JMUL|5.0|A criticism leveled at a currently running holiday movie, CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS, is that Jesus is mentioned nowhere in the plot. THE POLAR EXPRESS, a much superior film, doesn't either. (Just so you know if you care about such things.) THE POLAR EXPRESS is all about childhood belief in Santa Claus and getting presents. If, like me, you don't particularly care much anymore (Bah humbug!) about Santa and presents, the film represents an extraordinary achievement in animation and motion-capture technology. And, it's great fun.<br /><br />The plot is simple. On Christmas Eve, a young boy finds himself doubting the existence of Santa even as he gazes at the ornamented tree and the cookies and moo laid out for jolly St. Nick. He goes to sleep suspecting that Dad is the real benefactor. In any case, he's awakened in the middle of the night by the steam-belching locomotive of the Polar Express, which has pulled to a stop in the street. After some initial hesitation, our young hero climbs aboard for a wild ride to the North Pole where his belief in Santa may (or may not) be resurrected.<br /><br />This film, insofar as it uses real actors to provide the voiceovers and the substrate for the motion-capture effects, is virtually a one man show for Tom Hanks, who \\"plays\\" the Boy Hero, his father, the train's conductor, a mysterious hobo, a Scrooge puppet, and Santa himself. (The Boy Hero's voice is provided by Daryl Sabra. Tom doesn't do soprano.) You'd think the Screen Actor's Guild would protest the reduction in actors required to meet casting requirements.<br /><br />As an exercise in motion-capture, THE POLAR EXPRESS is an intriguing glimpse at what may be the future of the motion picture industry. As seen in this film, they haven't quite yet got the technique down perfect. The human movements are faintly unnatural - perhaps a greater concentration of motion sensors are needed on the real life actor's skin. And the eyes are sometimes downright creepy. (If my wife showed up with such orbs, I'd search the Yellow Pages for \\"exorcist\\".) The animation of the animals in the film is, however, superlative, as evidenced by a breathtaking sequence of a running pack of wolves that left me positively delighted.<br /><br />I'm awarding five stars for the incredibly detailed visuals. It's a small thing, but I was entranced, for example, by the swirling vortices of ice flakes created by the train's passage through a snowstorm as framed by the rear door of the last passenger car. I find it amazing and commendable that the film's creators would think to include such an esoteric detail.<br /><br />It's been predicted in some quarters that THE POLAR EXPRESS will become a Yuletide season classic. That it would ever replace IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is doubtful. Tom Hanks, as phenomenal as he is, is no Jimmy Stewart. And THE POLAR EXPRESS doesn't have even a fraction of the warm fuzziness. But the latter is at the top of its genre, as I'm sure the next Oscar awards will recognize.owed up with such orbs, I'd search the Yellow Pages for \\"exorcist\\".)

B00062ZE3U|3.0|That's unfortunatelly true. Within Temptation sold their souls for money and this album shows it well :( <br /> <br />Why are they now using that crapy electronic music like Evanescence ??!! It's %^%&. <br /> <br />But there are some good points on this CD. Favs: Forsaken, Angels, Jillian and See who I'm. Those are REAL songs by Within Temptation and old fans should like them :) <br /> <br />Instead of this album I'd recommend Mother Earth it's much superior to this new album.
B0006399FS|2.0|...we should truly not expect any great things coming from that band. One has to be listening to very little music, or, to be more precise, very little edge-cutting music to consider U2's latest outing significant or good by such standards. <br /> <br />    Take their newest single \\"Vertigo\\" for example. If this lil song was made by any other band not named U2 would anyone notice it? I heavily, very heavily, doubt it. The sad fact is that songs like \\"Vertigo\\" or most of the songs on this album are written and released by the 1000s on a yearly basis from bands all over the world: nice lil straightforward songs, with a banal riff and a drumline, and there ya have it. Now most such songs and albums dont make it past the shelf of the record store, or, if they get promotion bordering silliness (like U2 do) they might become a minor hit. <br /> <br />   When you have to look to the distant past to re-discover a band's great moments (if they have any) then you have a sign that the idea-tank has probably long run out. I'm not necessarily insisting that inspiration has terminally expired for this band but things do look (and sound) pretty bleak judging from this LP. <br /> <br />    U2 fans may freely proceed to bash this review at your leisure, but I simply cant praise an album that sounds like a gadzillion albums out there only because of the band name...

B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce is a good artist but I really believe that people and the entertainment industry have blown her OUT of porportion. One of the reasons why her solo album did well because boyfriend JAY-Z helped produced it. And everybody knows that when you watch a Destiny's Child video the only person you see the most of is her. There are 3 artists in the group, at least for right now. Word is that the Group is trying to kick out Michelle stating that she can't handle in the spotlight. Some people think it's because she fell on 106 & Park. But my thing is don't keep letting go of people in your group. This will be the 4th person to leave. Their just not leaving for nothing!!!! Seems like to me Mrs. Jay Z and Kelly wants the spotlight to themselves and Kelly probably would've left a long time ago if it wasn't for being adopted by Beyonce's family. Beyonce is WAY OVER-RATED!!!  Think about it.
B00005V0X5|5.0|This album is increadable. It doesn't matter what bands of rock you like, you will like this album. It beats the crap out of Kill 'em All, Show No Mercy, and Fist Full of Metal from the other Four Horsemen. I love every song in this album. The only problem is the song \\"These Boots.\\" It has the worst editing job done on it. For one thing, the lyrics aren't even that offensive, secondly, I would rather have an instrumental song or a song with only a courus than a song with a whole bunch of beeps. I think that Dave should have released the album with the song unedited and would have problably won the case of the origional writer pressed charges. The rest of the album is pure gold. I love \\"Mechanix\\", its way better than \\"The Four Horsemen\\" by Metallica. I also like the voice doubling on \\"Killing is My Business...and Business is GOOD!\\". The only bad thing is the unfair EXPLICET CONTENT warning on the cover. It only got that rating because it had a demo of \\"Mechanix\\" which has the 'F' word on it but the album doesn't even say it as much as other albums that have slid by. So if you like Megadeth, buy this CD next. You won't stop listening to it until you die.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This one is a big departure from what they usually do, I do not like Mikael's gruff vocals at all, I don't think they fit the music. Opeth is too good for the growling vocals, and they prove it completely on this release. First off, the vocals are exclusively clean, no growls at all. Most songs are done with the clean channel guitar sound, or straight acoustic/e-coustic. These guys can play their instruments, no doubt about that. All the songs are quite long, and a bit on the somber side. There's even one that has a latin feel to it, at least near the end of the song... Very cool stuff, I hope they make more recordings like this one.
0064407667|1.0|As a teacher who likes to read aloud to my kids, I thought it would be fun to read this book boys before the movie comes out.  We are fans of Harry Potter and had heard great reviews of this book.  I read the first chapter to them, and stopped!  After reading the rest of the wretched book on my own, I'll neither finish reading it to my sons nor take them to the movie.  How horrible that a book supposedly for kids has no redeeming value at all.  I have no desire to expose my sons to \\"entertainment\\" that has child abuse (verbal, physical and possible sexual) as it's central theme.  It's TRASH!
B00005JLEX|4.0|It took me a loooooong time to get used to Seinfeld, and I still have mixed feelings about. For even though the show is often very funny, and groundbreaking, I just can't get past that I really don't like any of the characters. They are neurotic, selfabsorbed, and small-minded. The problems which occupy them are microscopic ones: It is a huge issue when somebody sees you (apparently) picking your nose. They \\"handle\\" all those problems mainly by lying and avoidance. They never seem to learn that it does not work.  <br /> <br />It is clear that this comes from Larry David, and his personality is even more clear in \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\", a show I just gave up on. It is openly acknowledged that a lot from both shows comes directly from his experiences and personality (George mostly). Rob Reiner in an interview calls Larry David \\"curmudgeonly, misanthropic, and dyspeptic\\". And Rob is not even an enemy!  <br /> <br />Still, like I said, often funny, and the DVDs are very good.  <br /> <br />And you might well learn something about people. I do suppose some people are like these, though I don't like the thought.
B0002ZMITY|1.0|Huge fan of the show, so I thought I'd rent his movie. I was severly disappointed. Some reviews here state that if you enjoy Ali G on tv, you must enjoy the movie. Not true at all. The intelligent and witty humor in the show is a complete opposite of the crass and base \\"humor\\" of the movie. I had to stop watching it after twenty minutes, and the only reason I put the movie back in was to see Borat's cameo. So I sat through the movie, and Borat said two words. I finished the movie, hoping for some glimmer of worth. No dice.
B00068IOWC|1.0|U2 better dismantle this bomb before it is too late.  This album tries to be something U2 is not.  Instead of making 'Pop' music for the younger crowd - U2 needs to stick to the music that put them in stadiums and the rest of us have grown up with. Disappointing at best.
B0002CX4RM|5.0|This DVD is a tresure for all opera lovers. First of all, this performance of Samson et Dalila happened on the opening night at the Met 1998 and opening nights at the Met are always special. Second, it was 30 year anniversary of Placido Domingo's cooperation with Metropoliten Opera and with this opening performance he tied (and later surpassed) Enrico Caruzo's record of 17 opening night performances at the Met, which is amazing. At the end of the show, Placido was congratulated by the Metropoliten Opera board and even major of New-York city Rudi Gulliani. Placido, himself, gave a very emotional speech appreciating every person who somehow contributed in his remarkeble career.<br />This whole scene was very mooving and touching. However, for me this DVD stands out for outstanding, phenomenal performance of Olga Borodina, who is one of nowadays leading mezzo-sopranos in the world. I heard her last yeat at Lyric Opera of Chicago in Samson et Dalila and I was shocked by the beauty and power of her voice. This year I saw her in Aida and, once again, she was absolutely magnificent. She has one of the gorgeous voices you will ever hear in your life. If you get a chance to see her live, you must do it. Hearing Olga Borodina live and from TV screen it is a big difference. All the great opera singers sound so much better live. However, she is still amazing singing-wise and acting-wise on this DVD.<br />So this is a must have DVD for everyone who loves opera. 5 stars!  maybe 6!
B00005JLT5|5.0|Aside from the fact that I thought it was a well-made film (done by Roman Polanski), it did cover the subject of the Wausaw Ghetto uprising. The main charachter (played by Adrienne Brody) in the movie was involved in the part of the effort to smuggle firearms to the Jewish resistance members who plotted the Warsaw Ghetto rebellion. He almost gets caught a couple of times as well. Later, after escaping his captors, he is put into hiding by friends in which his room has a view of a section of the Ghetto and sees the uprising break out first hand. After the fighting is over, Brody's charachter openly expresses regrets to a friend visiting him in the apartment he is hiding in that he wished he was there. His friend replies that he would have ended up dead or worse and it wasnt worth it. His friend then says she is sure that the example of the Jew's courage of resistance will inspire others in Poland to resist the Nazis. I thought this little tie that was shown in this film makes it clear that these scenes are an acknowledgement that the Wausaw Jews who resisted the Nazis with smuggled firearms inspired the Poles to resist the Nazis too. The whole movie itself is based on a true story. Overall, The Pianist is a great flick.

B000669GAI|5.0|I own all the PJ albums and Every LP, Plus all the Bootleggs I've been too. <br />This Cd set is awsome because I don;t have to keep switching CD's.  If I want to listen to all the radio singles there they are.  Most of my Frinds arn't the biggest fans of PJ but they like the radio stuff so this is something I can put in while they are in the car.    <br /> <br />To the Kid that said Limp Bizket was Grunge. <br /> Are you retarted?
B00005JMUA|5.0|this movie is good before i even saw the first one i thought \\"woah... i think she wants to kill bill or something\\" and then when i saw it i was let down when she didn't kill him in the first one and i didn't know part 2 was coming out until it came out on commercials and then i thought \\"woah...she probably got bill in this one\\"...and then i saw it that day...i saw a golpher that day what a day. and the movie was satisfying
B000006TSC|5.0|This was the first album I ever heard by Camel, when I found it at some mom-and-pop CD store that was closing out a bunch of One Way Records discs like this one and its followup, 'I Can See Your House From Here.' While it may seem very tempting to automatically brand this as a pop album, my first impression held it in very high regard. Sure, there's some dancefloor influence in here and a couple of Lite-FM friendly numbers, but overall the musicianship is sincere and inspired. Poppy as the songs may be, the musicians involved definitely used a craftsman's approach in arranging this music to sound exactly like they wanted it too. And they didn't leave many loose ends. Silly as it is, \\"Down on the Farm\\" even shows a considerable amount of production attention, with Latimer's skittish guitar riff in the verse and the playful vocal harmonies in the heavier part. \\"Wing and a Prayer\\" features a fabulous sounding 12-string guitar part and a really catchy electric piano part. The softer songs (\\"Starlight Ride\\", \\"Breathless\\") make very good use of the flute and saxes, which give the songs a tasteful orchestral feel (without sounding overblown or overproduced). Lastly, the album doesn't at all kiss the better parts of \\"progressive\\" music goodbye. \\"Echoes\\" and \\"The Sleeper\\" feature outstanding instrumental performances that are definitely worthy of attention. These songs definitely stand up to the instrumental performances on Camel's earlier albums. The album also features plenty of odd times (often not obviously stated, which in my opinion is the best way to incorporate them), some great soloing and instrumental leads (Latimer's solo on 'Summer Lightning' is really well-done), and great bass playing (Sinclair uses a fretless which works well with the jazzy approach of the album). When I first got this, not knowing about Camel's so-called \\"classics,\\" I was every bit as impressed with the music as I was when I later acquired \\"Mirage\\" and \\"Moonmadness.\\" Sure, the style is more commercial and poppy, then say, all of \\"Snow Goose,\\" but the performance is sincere and well-done. None of this music sounded forced, and it sounded like they were truly inspired when they were working on it.ommercial and poppy, then say, all of \\"Snow Goose,\\" but the performance is sincere and well-done.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is so funny!  Its weird sense of humor is not for everyone but I really liked it.  Napoleon's \\"sweet\\" dance moves and Kip's voice are my favorites.  You'll be quoting this movie for months!
B00003CX7L|5.0|It is rare for a sequel to surpass the original movie artistically as well as commercially. One of those rare sequels is \\"Toy Story 2\\". I didn't think it was possible for Disney and Pixar to create a sequel as good as the first \\"Toy Story\\" but they did. \\"Toy Story 2\\" is that rare treasure.<br /><br />In \\"Toy Story 2\\" Woody is stolen by Al, the toy collector who plans on selling his collection of Woody and the Round Up Gang to a Japanese toy collector. With Woody kidnapped, Buzz Lightyear, Ham, Slink, Mr. Potato Head, and Rex sets off to find their kidnapped companion. There are three new characters in the movie, Stinky Pete (voiced by Kelsey Grammar), Jessie (Joan Cusack), and Bullseye the horse. The writing and animation is superb. I really enjoyed the scenes with Woody, Jessie, Stinky Pete, and Bullseye. One of my personal scenes is when the toy collector calls in the old man to fix Woody's arm. The details in the animation is amazing and very realistic. I also loved the scenes when Jessie reminisces about her former owner Emily. It was very poignant without coming off as drippy. Sarah McLachlan's song added a melancholy feel to the scenes. Another great moment in the film was when Buzz and the gang were in the toy store looking for Al, the toy collector.<br /><br />\\"Toy Story 2\\" is one of my favorite Disney/Pixar collaborations. This is a film that can be enjoyed by all ages. It is also one of the best films ever, animated or not. The writing in this film is simply too good to ignore. I still enjoy watching this movie to this very day and not get tired of it.
0316666343|4.0|The lovely bones by Alice Sebold is truly the most influencial book a person could read about the value of living.In the book a teenage girl is brutaly raped and killed by her next door neighboor. Many times while reading the book i found myself crying. This book was happy and sad and funny and ironic. All in all it was a great book. The only thing that i didn't like was how graphic she was during the rape which did add an emotional grasp to the book but was still too disturbing. I would definetly read this book over just so that i could once again grasp the value of life. This book has truly changed my  whole aspects on how others will react to my death.  <br />   Alice Sebold's image of heaven is truly unique. She gives a whole new idea of how it looks like and who's there.All in all this book will open your eyes if not your heart.
B0001AP12G|3.0|First of all, I didn't see this off MTV- I stopped watching that a long time ago.  Secondly, this is a solid album, not great, but pretty good nonetheless.  There's a few songs I could do without, the fillers, but there are great songs on it. My favorite is The New Workout Plan, a dark satirical song with a superficial facade...I especially love the lines...My name is Alamae from Moville, Alabama...and I just want to say since listenin' to Kanye's workout tape... been able to date outside the family, I got a double wide...HAHAHA!! I was fell out of my chair when I heard that. Other great songs: All Falls Down (the video  is really good with stacey dash :), Through the Wire.  Buy this album...or borrow it from someone, but get it.
B000000OUE|5.0|I've loved this album since i was a kid in the fifth grade. I still love this album, a decade later. I never stopped loving this album. I think that speaks for itself. <br /> <br />In my opinion, the earlier white zombie and later rob zombie don't begin to stack up to this.

B00005JNJ7|2.0|South Park was an excellent creation by Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  The creators of South Park took their success a step father and created South Park the Movie.  These are superb works in my mind, but Team America may have gone a step too far without enough careful planning.   <br /> <br />There are a few funny parts in the movie although I feel the comedy is geared towards an immature crowd, and how can the creators appeal to an immature crowd when the movie is rated R.  Only an immature crowd would be amused by long sex scenes with dolls, Gary's five minute vomit scene, and people with speech impediments.  Team America was intended to be a comedy and was also intended to be politically incorrect and offend a lot of people.  It succeeded in doing this however did not offend me.  The producers relied on the maturity level of the viewer to be low in order for the intended comedy to work.  <br /> <br />The rating system for movies that come out have very strict guidelines that have to be followed.  Due to Team America, I believe there should be another rating in between R and X.  Team America deserves the R rating it got but compared to other movies who have received an R rating, Team America should be worse.   <br /> <br />I was truly disappointed in the movie.  When previews began I was excited to see Team America thinking it would be ten times better than any South Park.  I believe that a single half hour episode of South Park has the same amount of comedy as this movie showed.  A person who enjoys South Park has a better chance of enjoying this movie than someone who does not like South Park.   <br /> <br />If you feel that watching dolls on strings prance around, fake buildings exploding, long doll sex and vomit scenes and speech impediments are absolutely hilarious, then Team America: World Police is a movie for you.  <br />

I was a teenager and thought they were the greatest things since sliced bread. <br /> <br />I own all of the albums on vinyl...LOL <br /> <br />Seriously, my musical tastes are a bit more sophisticated now but I love listening to these songs and singing at the top of my lungs. Careless Whisper was the best dramatic 80's ballad ever. <br /> <br />My other favorite is the extended version of Everything She Wants. ( I would love for Maxwell to remake this song. His voice would really do it justice). <br /> <br />While George went on to make Faith....another great album....you can immerse yourself in this compilation and relive the 80's when Neon and Tshirts with BIG BLACK WRITING were in!
B00030590I|5.0|Since I did not see the theater release I can only comment on my viewing it at home.   <br /> <br />I overhead projected the DVD using a Marantz 12S2 DLP projector on a 100\\" Da-lite Cinema Contour screen.  I thought the video superb but again not able to make a direct comparsion to the theater release.  I to noticed the switch to B&W in part of an early scene.  Chalked that up to director's choice and enjoyed it none the less. <br /> <br />\\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" was my first look at the highly stylized kung-fu action scene.  My first reaction (after a few minutes) was one of non-believability.  Now I have come to realize that this is no more than ballet and try to enjoy it on that level. <br /> <br />I viewed the film in Mandarin with English subtitles and enjoyed it very much even though I felt as if I was missing some beauty when diverting my eyes to the sub-titles.  I spooled the movie again this morning to check out the Engish dubbing.  It was accented english but the voice quality seemed to match the actors voices and the dubbing was near perfectly synched. <br /> <br />I found the story to be absorbing, well told, and well acted.  I was not thinking \\"propaganda\\" at all during the movie and even as I reflect on it I do not get that sense.  This movie can be enjoyed on many levels so turn loose and have a good time.

B00005JL96|5.0|Stitch is a genetically engineered alien creature programmed for mass disruption who is bulletproof and super strong. Lilo is the troubled little Hawaiian girl who adopts Stitch as her pet dog when he escapes captivity on his home planet. This beautifully animated film is full of imaginative, whimsical characters and I found it very entertaining. Thankfully, it contains no unnecessary musical numbers.<br /><br />I don't like musicals, so any time a Disney film comes along without any silly musical numbers it already has a positive head start with me. That isn't to say Lilo lacks signing and dancing completely - there is a traditional Hawaiian performance at the beginning and end of the film, and also a number of unexpected Elvis songs. The Hawaiian traditional fit in with the setting of the film so it didn't have that contrived feel of most animated musical numbers, like say, everything from Lion King. My initial knee-jerk reaction to it was - this must be some liberal, multicultural Disney pandering, but it really had a natural feel to it so I didn't mind at all. And the notion of a little Hawaiian girl being a devoted Elvis fan at such a young age is hilarious and just plain fun.<br /><br />Stitch spends most of the film on the run from the crazy scientist who created him as well as a specialist on the planet Earth. Lilo is cared for by her big sister after their parents died in an accident. This lack of family by both Lilo and Stitch serves as the foundation of their friendship.<br /><br />Stitch is a great little monster - he was designed to cause chaos but finds himself on the peaceful island of Hawaii. He has a tendency to tear up everything in sight but without any large cities to terrorize he must find a new purpose for himself. The story develops this family theme throughout and manages to tug at the audience's heart strings without being too obvious about it. Stitch is the result of illegal genetic engineering, and you might expect the film to get a little preachy on the subject. Fortunately it does not, but we can infer that the film takes the stance that any such living creature has the right to its own life.<br /><br />The animation is outstanding with brilliant, vivid colors dominating nearly every scene. The film had a more traditional, hand drawn feel to it than the more geometrically drawn features like Toy Story or the super realistic Shrek or Monsters, Inc.little preachy on the subject.

B0001AP12G|4.0|Just for a second, stop reading this review, and go listen to hip hop radio for an hour; I guarantee you that 7 out of 10 sonds will either be produced by either Lil' Jon(who I'll talk about another time) and the new kid on the block, one Mr. Kanye West. If you hadn't heard his name by the beginning of this year, you've certainly heard his work. The engineer behind all of Roc-A-Fella significant work of the last four years, as well as big hits for other artists(Ludacris, Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys), he is now what the Neptunes were two years ago. What he also does is bridge the gap between the commercial and the underground, also working with Dilated Peoples, Jurassic 5 and Slum Village. I pre-ordered College Dropout weeks in advance, and I wasn't disappointed. Us fans that are truly in the know about hip hop cringe about the thought of rappers picking up the mic(P. Diddy, Pharell, The Big Tymers, etc.), I was most impressed by Kanye's flow; on the Roc's roster, I would rank him third, behing Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel. He raps about what most mainsteram rappers talik about, but he doesn't let the bling-bling run his life; at the same time, he promotes a consciousness that has long been missimg from hip hop, yet he doesn't song like a hypocrite who chastises others for enjoying the accesses of life. The huge hit \\"Slow Jams\\" featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx shows that midwest isn't all about Eminem and Common(who is also on the album). \\"Through The Wire\\" sounds like the rags-to-riches triumph record reminsicent of the Notorious B.I.G \\"Juicy\\" era that hip hop sorely needs. \\"Workout Plan\\" is a hilarious parody of gold diggers and their mannerisms;but my favorite two songs are \\"All Falls Down\\" and the suprisingly spiritual and honest \\"Jesus Walks\\". I hope Kanye doesn't get pigeonholed in his producing or stature as a producer; if not he's well on his way to Dr. Dre and DJ Premier legend.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (LOTR) is the second film in a trilogy bringing the cult favorite Tolkien series of novels to the big screen. This was a massive undertaking considering the sheer scope of the fictional world and the number and variety of creatures created in the novels. All three films were shot all at once and are being released over the course of three years. The first film, The Fellowship of the Ring, was released in 2001 and grossed over $300 million at the US box-office and untold millions more worldwide and home release. The production budget was $100 million and change, and was filmed entirely on location in New Zealand. It won four Oscars (mostly technical: cinematography, makeup, visual effects, original score) and was nominated for nine more. It was an unarguable success which has made the release of the second film all the more highly anticipated.<br /><br />Towers picks up right where Fellowship left off, and I'll assume you've seen Fellowship, or else this won't make much sense. The plot is fairly straightforward: the Hobbit protagonist Frodo is tasked with returning the magical and evil ring of power to the lava filled mountain from whence it came in order to destroy it and stop the world of Middle Earth from being overrun by some really nasty looking orcs and other bad guys. However, unlike in Fellowship, this has almost become a secondary plot line. The main action in Towers instead focuses on the human Aragorn and the buildup and eventual finale scene that is the massive battle at Helmsdeep where the good guys are badly outnumbered by the evil Uruk-Hai warriors. A third minor plot line involves two other hobbits and their attempt to rejoin their friends after being captured. Though minor, this side story really adds to the film with its humor and action.<br /><br />Let me preface this by saying I consider a film to be a separate and distinct work of art even if it is based entirely on some other work, such as a novel. The film must stand on its own and must not be compared to the novel as this is an entirely different medium. It is impossible for a film to incorporate all the details and intricacies presented in a novel (much less three novels) and Tolkien geeks out there who criticize the films for omitting the many excruciating details of the three novels are just plain wrong, and also need to get a life. At most, I would expect the film to attempt to maintain the essence of the novel and not contradict the novel in any significant way.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Tower and realized that this is exactly the kind of movie I have been missing for a long time. LOTR skillfully creates its own world and its characters operate in it faithful to its own rules. Towers is a brilliantly made epic action adventure film that effectively creates tension in its buildup and dramatic and exciting action sequences in the eventual payoff. Special effects abound but are used well and never strain the audience's imagination in accepting them as reality.<br /><br />The two captured Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, spend most of the film either in shackles when captured, or scampering away while escaping or running from their captors. Their story gets much more interesting when they seek shelter in the forest and discover Treebeard, a walking and talking tree. He is a member of the oldest race in Middle Earth, and he and his comrades serve as a sort of forest ranger service in the woods. The trees move, talk, and think very slowly and carefully as you might expect a tree to. They are generally uninterested in the affairs of the world outside the forest, but the Hobbits give them a reason to care and join their battle.<br /><br />Frodo and Sam continue on their own to try and return the ring to the mountain and destroy it but get sidetracked when they are joined by Gollum, the creature that previously owned the ring. Gollum is entirely computer generated, but is fully realized and a real addition to the film. Unlike say Jar Jar from Star Wars, Gollum is an interesting character that does not annoy the audience. His origins are mysterious, and as I understand are not even explored in the novels. He has a split personality, one half evil that still desires the ring, the other half good and desiring to aid Frodo in his quest. This split personality manifests in some of the most humorous scenes in the film. Gollum desires the ring like a drug, he cannot resist it. You can't help but pity the creature. He battles himself constantly, fighting his evil side to aid the Hobbits.<br /><br />Gandalf returns after taking a nasty spill in the labyrinth battle in the first film. It turns out he went on to defeat the nasty Balrog fire monster and was rewarded by being transformed into a more powerful wizard, Gandalf the White. If my memory is right, wizards must complete significant and difficult tasks in order to advance in their level of power and skill. I also recall that white wizards are the highest order and most powerful of all wizards. This is definitely a good thing for our side. I felt a little disappointed though - I wanted to see Gandalf whip out some wicked, earth shattering spells on the bad guys, but he never really does. In the final battle sequence, he really just conks a few orcs over the head with his staff - where's the fun in that?<br /><br />The buildup to the battle at Helmsdeep is unusually effective. Jackson does not rush the film and allows every scene to take its time. He wants the audience to feel the palpable tension that precedes a battle such as this, and I felt he succeeded. He truly makes this scene feel as big as its supposed to be. The battle scenes are very heavy on the computer graphics but never had that ridiculously fake looking quality of say, the clone battle in Star Wars 2. One big help is an advanced programming technique that gives every one of the thousands of individual warriors in the big battle scenes a mind of its own. This gives the artificial characters a more realistic look since they all do their own thing while having the same goal in mind, much the way real people would. This is not a new technique; I remember it being used in the penguin scenes of Batman Returns.<br /><br />Jackson recognizes the need for comic relief in such a dark and serious film. The Hobbits provide much of this. The remainder comes mainly from the dwarf Gimli. I've already read some criticism saying his many one liners are out of place. I disagree and say they are a welcome break in a film that is quite bleak at times. Plus they are completely in keeping with the personality of the character. Gimli is a dwarf, and they are rambunctious creatures. The love to fight, but at the same time believe in eating, drinking, and being merry when they are not at war.<br /><br />I have little to complain about in this film. As I said I'd like to see a little more magic play from the wizard characters. I did feel some of the action stretched the audience's reasonably suspended sense of reality in a few scenes when only one or two characters would defeat dozens and dozens of bad guys in head on contact.<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone disliking this film. It scored an almost perfect 97% on the Tomatometer. It has already made a ton of money and I suspect will surpass the first film due largely to its greater action orientation. By now, the initial hype has simmered down and you should probably be able to get in to the show without worrying about a sellout.Unlike say Jar Jar from Star Wars, Gollum is an interesting character that does not annoy the audience.

B00005JLRT|2.0|The tenth in the Star Trek movie series, Nemesis promises to be the last - I can only hope. Ever since Star Trek Generations, the first featuring The Next Generation (TNG) crew the series has gone from disappointing to bad to horrible. Generations was an awkward attempt to bridge The Original Series (TOS) crew with TNG. Its closing scene features the death of legendary Captain Kirk - a scene so bad it had to be refilmed after test audience practically rioted after witnessing the original version. The final cut was hardly better. First Contact followed and was a poor rehash of many already worn out themes from TNG such as the Borg and scarecrow boy Data's unending search for humanity. The inexplicable Insurrection was so bad my mind blocked out all knowledge that I had ever witnessed it like a traumatic childhood experience. Only intensive refreshing with Dave the movie guru was able to reawaken these troubling memories. Finally, Nemesis (aka The Final Insult) closes the Start Trek movie saga with a whimper of unoriginality.<br /><br />Your humble reviewer is an old school trekkie who loves both TOS and TNG so there is no series bias here. I thought the TNG TV series was excellent, and remain extremely disappointed that the TNG movies are unable to even rival the quality of the old 60 minute TV shows. The TNG movie series attempted to win both the discriminating existing trekkie audience and still appeal to the general movie going public as well. Obviously, it has failed to appeal to any mass audience and has only further alienated existing trekkies. Nemesis scored a lousy 43% on the Tomatometer and has failed to take in any serious money at the box office.<br /><br />The plot seems promising: a Picard clone created by the Romulans with the intention of replacing the real Picard rebels against his Romulan captors to lead the Reman slave race in a bid for control of the quadrant. The clone has built a super space ship with a super radiation weapon of some kind so powerful it could wipe out an entire planet with one shot - sound familiar yet? The Real Picard is drawn in and proceeds to confront his \\"nemesis\\".<br /><br />The film opens with a ridiculously contrived action sequence in which Picard, Data and Worf fly a shuttle craft down to a strange planet and proceed to drive a dune buggy like vehicle around searching for what turn out to be chunks of a Data prototype. The party is ambushed by some Mad Max looking raiders toting archaic machine guns. First of all, you never take a shuttle craft when you could easily beam down to the surface. Second, there is no way the party could be ambushed by such primitive creatures, the Enterprise thoroughly scanned the area and would have surely warned the captain of such impending trouble. Heck, even their handheld tricorders should have picked them up! It's all really a setup for The Big Stunt where the dune buggy is driven off a cliff into the bay of the remote controlled shuttle craft as the party escapes the bad guys. The reason for the dune buggy is explained away as \\"captain's prerogative\\" and it is implied that Picard was just out for a little fun. This is completely out of the established Picard character. It's also completely unlikely that there would by many such thrill seekers left in Starfleet as they all have access to the way cool holodeck where any such fun can be had any time someone gets that daredevil itch. I never thought I would be accusing Star Trek of manufacturing such low brow action but there it is. Apply preceding criticism to almost all remaining scenes.<br /><br />The film meanders on with many similar gratuitous action sequences. Phaser rifle shootouts in the halls of the ship. Unending volleys of phaser and torpedo fire between ships.<br /><br />The crux of the story is this: the clone Shinzon is madly driven by vengeance and is determined to destroy the earth with his radiation weapon thingy. Yet the film never establishes his alleged hatred of mankind or anymotive whatsoever that he might have against earth. If anything, he should be out to get the Romulans, who left him for dead in the Reman dilithium mines. Instead he is driven to help the very people who brought him true suffering.<br /><br />There is also an underlying theme regarding Shinzon's status as a clone. There is an old scientific debate regarding the formation of a human personality and behavior patterns as being determined predominantly by genetics, or by environment. Shinzon believes he is a mirror image of Picard, being a clone and all, and that he is doing exactly what his environment dictates. He tells Picard that he would have done the same thing had Picard been in Shinzon's place. Aside from being massively irrelevant to the story presented (it would seem the only purpose for this fact is to give the movie a cool name) it ends up being very unrealistic in practice. Picard's character has been well established over the 7 year TNG series - and one thing is certain - he is a reasonable and rational man to the last, and would have chosen a very different course of action given Shinzon's environment.<br /><br />There are more plot mistakes and glaring inconsistencies with the existing Star Trek universe that it's almost as if the film was intended to stand alone, separate from history. Taking such a stance would not improve my rating much.<br /><br />The effects in Nemesis are acceptable. However they fail to inspire the awe and wonder of earlier, better films like the original Motion Picture, or Wrath of Khan in particular. The original model work was much better - the current Enterprise has gotten cluttered and lacks the simple elegance of the originals.<br /><br />Nemesis lacks any sense of originality and rips off many better films in its muddled execution. In particular many have made reference to Wrath of Khan which Nemesis badly imitates in many respects, the vengeance motivated plot, the naval style duel between the two ships, and the tragic death of a key character who sacrifices himself for the ship. Needless to say, it is a poor imitation of a truly excellent film. As stated before, the vengeance motivation is very badly formed, there is no connection between Shinzon and Picard or the rest of humanity. Unlike the original battles in Wrath of Khan, the fight scenes in Nemesis are thoughtless, no brainers consisting of point blank shots volleyed back and forth. There is no tension or suspense created in these scenes. And finally, it was sad to see Spock die, and the audience truly rejoiced at his rebirth. The death of data was lame at best, I for one am glad to see him finally go, and I won't be rooting for a comeback which was also tacked on as a possibility.<br /><br />It's sad that Roddenberry's creation has been so badly distorted. TNG was a cerebral series that focused on internal human conflict and the very nature of existence. The movies fail because they reject this premise in favor of tacky space opera style shootouts and cheesy formula plots. I don't know if there is any plan to turn Voyager or the newest series into movies, it could hardly get any worse though.nd or any motive whatsoever that he might have against earth. If anything, he should be out to get the Romulans, who left him for dead in the Reman dilithium mines. Instead he is driven to help the very people who brought him true suffering. <br /> <br />There is also an underlying theme regarding Shinzon's status as a clone. There is an old scientific debate regarding the formation of a human personality and behavior patterns as being determined predominantly by genetics, or by environment. Shinzon believes he is a mirror image of Picard, being a clone and all, and that he is doing exactly what his environment dictates. He tells Picard that he would have done the same thing had Picard been in Shinzon's place. Aside from being massively irrelevant to the story presented (it would seem the only purpose for this fact is to give the movie a cool name) it ends up being very unrealistic in practice. Picard's character has been well established over the 7 year TNG series - and one thing is certain - he is a reasonable and rational man to the last, and would have chosen a very different course of action given Shinzon's environment. <br /> <br />There are more plot mistakes and glaring inconsistencies with the existing Star Trek universe that it's almost as if the film was intended to stand alone, separate from history. Taking such a stance would not improve my rating much. <br /> <br />The effects in Nemesis are acceptable. However they fail to inspire the awe and wonder of earlier, better films like the original Motion Picture, or Wrath of Khan in particular. The original model work was much better - the current Enterprise has gotten cluttered and lacks the simple elegance of the originals. <br /> <br />Nemesis lacks any sense of originality and rips off many better films in its muddled execution. In particular many have made reference to Wrath of Khan which Nemesis badly imitates in many respects, the vengeance motivated plot, the naval style duel between the two ships,and the tragic death of a key character who sacrifices himself for the ship. Needless to say, it is a poor imitation of a truly excellent film. As stated before, the vengeance motivation is very badly formed, there is no connection between Shinzon and Picard or the rest of humanity. Unlike the original battles in Wrath of Khan, the fight scenes in Nemesis are thoughtless, no brainers consisting of point blank shots volleyed back and forth. There is no tension or suspense created in these scenes. And finally, it was sad to see Spock die, and the audience truly rejoiced at his rebirth. The death of data was lame at best, I for one am glad to see him finally go, and I won't be rooting for a comeback which was also tacked on as a possibility. <br /> <br />It's sad that Roddenberry's creation has been so badly distorted. TNG was a cerebral series that focused on internal human conflict and the very nature of existence. The movies fail because they reject this premise in favor of tacky space opera style shootouts and cheesy formula plots. I don't know if there is any plan to turn Voyager or the newest series into movies, it could hardly get any worse though.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|This Director's Cut improves on the original in almost every way. The plot holes are filled in, the fight scenes are more violent, and the romance is trimmed down a bit. And believe it or not, former rapper Coolio was actually quite funny, especially in the court scene when he mentions he uses only shotguns (you'll know what I mean when you see it). If this was the version released in theaters I think most people would have this one at the top of the Superhero film lists right beside Batman, X-Men 2, and Spider-Man 2. This version is worth buying and I will never watch the theatrical cut again.
B00008NRI8|3.0|Let me get a little personal bias out of the way right up front - I don't like romantic comedies as a movie genre. In fact I can't think of a single decent one off hand. They are overwhelmingly unoriginal, unfunny, and unromantic star vehicles that fail to even accomplish their stated goal and contribute nothing to the world of film. So the fact that I don't hate this film says something I suppose.<br /><br />A movie like this plays heavily on the audiences existing belief that opposites attract in order to make the unlikely romantic connection more plausible. I don't know how true this common belief is in reality - I suspect it is not as successful as the saying would have us believe. Plus it creates plenty of good comedic situations when the two opposites interact.<br /><br />Hugh Grant is pretty much a lock with female audiences - every punch line he delivered got a strong response from the audience no matter how lame. The film establishes early on that Grant's character is really a good guy deep down but is unduly controlled by his older brother - a convenient excuse.<br /><br />I find Bullock fairly believable in her slightly novel role as a grittier, career driven leading lady. It first emerged in Miss Congeniality in which Bullock plays a tough as nails FBI agent working undercover as a beauty pageant contestant. However her character creates what I would call a critical plot flaw in Two Weeks. The film would have us believe she is a class leading Harvard lawyer - yet she hesitantly accepts Grants deal to work for him on the condition that his company spare her beloved community center from the wrecking ball. She writes an air tight employment contract that is so strong she cannot find a way out of it when she needs to - and at the same time fails to lock in the only thing she really cares about in the condition that the community center be saved. Have the standards at the vaunted Harvard Law fallen so low?<br /><br />A little bit of trivia: Coney Island is also the setting of one of my favorite films Requiem for a Dream. Sandra Bullock reminisces about the old neighborhood at one point and mentions an old couple, the Goldfarbs. Sarah Goldfarb was a lead character in Requiem and I'm guessing this is more than just a coincidence. Also in Requiem, director Aronofsky recalls in the director commentary that the famous and historic Thunderbolt rollercoaster was bulldozed in the middle of the night by a wrecking crew on the orders of then mayor Rudy Giuliani during his \\"cleanin up NY phase\\" in an attempt to avoid any such protests. It was replaced with a parking garage. This lends some credibility to Bullock's struggle to save the buildings around Coney Island. You will notice the distinct lack of rollercoaster in Two Weeks.and is also the setting of one of my favorite films Requiem for a Dream.

0385720920|5.0|I know many of you like Survivor, as is your due. It is a rockin' book. However, I am sticking with Choke as my favorite Chuck book. The rampant honesty about sex expressed in such a shameless way as only Chuck can write is freaking hilarious. The fact that he categorizes sex-addicts as losers and demonstrates the sad lengths to which they go to get off is perfect tearing down of the glamorized image of sex that American culture seems to defend.  <br />  Similarly his use of colonial settings for the other half of his novel tears into another aspect of American culture, our over-glorified history. The actual choke plot of \\"Choke\\" is incidentally pretty minor. Rather than parodying events in recent history as in Survivor, he turns his eye to two major facets of American culture, our addiction to sexual activity and our fantasy of a perfect and pure historical origin as a country. The whole time he is never preachy, he shows rather than tells. This is my favorite Chuck book. There, I've said it.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I liked this film very much for reasons a lot of other people did not -- it included long stretches where no one said anything that implied a certain reality unusual in Hollywood productions.<br /><br />I believe this created the aura of loneliness and alienation that allowed the principal parties in the film to find each other and blossom in a land where neither had a place or knew the language. The fact that both parties had significant problems in their personal life aided and abetted this engaging partnership.<br /><br />This is the summary message of this movie, in my opinion -- that it is possible to throw off all of life's problems, regardless of their enormous nature, by finding the right person in the right circumstance. This is what the cohorts did in Japan in \\"Lost In Translation\\" and I believe they did it very well.<br /><br />I've enjoyed many of Bill Murray's past films and liked his modest, subtle style in this movie. I believe it fit well with the overall scheme. His partner, actress Scarlett Johansson, played an intellectually bored young wife seeking connection when her husband left her, which occurred regularly. I liked this pairing. It was more realistic than the folks portrayed in most movies and certainly more intelligent.<br /><br />This film isn't the final word about anything but it presents 100 minutes where you can legally stalk other people, see their personal problems, sympathize with their situations and feel good about the ending. It's also quite a travelogue in Japan, if that happens to be a passion for you.
B00030590I|4.0|From the very beginning of this film it is entirely obvious that director Zhang Yimou studied Akira Kurosawa films before shooting.  This film is huge in scope with magnificent sets, a large cast of extras all clad in ancient armor, and beautiful locales for all the scenes to unfold shrouded in a veil of fantastic cinematography.  I was reminded of two Kurosawa films, in particular: \\"Ran\\" and \\"Rashomon.\\"  \\"Ran\\" because of the sheer size of this film with regards to sets, cast, and costumes; and \\"Rashomon\\" because of the unusual plotting.  It isn't until the film is nearing its conclusion that the entire truth is revealed with an historical aspect thrown in for good measure.  Of course, \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" is the most immediate comparison in modern day cinema with regards to the balletic choreography during the many fight sequences.  The magical fantasy that was so charming in \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" is given a much more serious tone here with ancient history/folklore as the driving spiritual force behind the story.  There are some minor flaws.  The one that stands out the most is when two similar scenes are compared.  Both are fight sequences that take place within the matched warriors' minds.  The early sequence is shot in black and white, while the later scene is shot in color.  That sort of lack of consistency is the main reason I cannot consider this a masterpiece.  There were many other small, though unfortunately noticable flaws scattered throughout the story, but to nitpick would be to forget how good the rest of the film is.  The cinematography is the true star here, though many of the actors acquit themselves with talent and dignity.  This is a glorious and colorful spectacle from one of my favorite directors, Zhang Yimou.  It was interesting that he chose to do an action film when his most notable films are all dramas.  Some of his finest works include \\"Raise the Red Lantern,\\" \\"Ju Dou,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"To Live.\\"  As for theDVD, the special features section highlights include a comprehensive documentary featurette and a sit-in with Quentin Tarantino and Jet Li talking about the film and other martial arts films of note.  All in all, this DVD is a solid purchase.  Recommended.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is the third major release by the Brit rock group and the best of the three. Most people who hear them immediatley think that they are just a radiohead rip off band. THIS IS WRONG. Yes Matt Bellamy's voice sort of sounds like Thom Yorks but mostly thats because they both have that like whiny british sounding voice. Muse has MIDI pick ups on both the bass and the guitar (which is run through a computer to allow for a greater range of sounds). But the major way to compare a bands similarities is by the chord structures and progressions. Radiohead and Muse's music move nothing alike. It is quite obvious that Matt Bellamy (who writes the songs) has had much classical training. You can tell by the way the music flows. Radiohead sounds nothing like that (not to put them down i certaintly love radiohead). This is definetly the best album released in years. Their live show is just as amazing. Everyday i wish that they would come and give me a private concert for me and my friends. The editorial review (done by Amazon.com) is completly wrong. This album is very original and is done incredibly well.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am a long time U2 fan.  Having endured the years of their experimental phases, and being pleased with the return to their rock and roll roots with their last album, I can say confidently \\"Welcome Back\\".  This is not a syncho pop album, but one that continues the musical theme regained with \\"All that you can't leave behind\\".  This is a soulful, intelligent album that reflects their roots and the maturity of their 25 years together and their place in life.  Take the time to listen to the whole album, the lyrics and music are complex, the arrangements and mix are tight.  Hope we can have them around for another 25 years....
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Yes Michael Jackson has had a few too many 'Greatest Hits' packages, but this one truly is the Ultimate collection of his musical work.  Four CDs jam packed with hits and rarities spanning his entire 34 year recording career (J5, The Jacksons and solo), a DVD of his Dangerous concert that aired on HBO (available here for the first time) and an original 60 page book detailing his entire career.  There's precious little more you could ask for from a box set.<br /><br />Now Michael has only released 6 full albums of new material in the past 25 years so chances are that most already have the hits in one form or another so why buy this set?  Consider the following list of all the rare and previously unreleased songs in this collection.<br /><br />Enjoy Yourself - The Jacksons first hit from their first album with Epic<br /><br />Ease On Down The Road / You Can't Win - both from The Wiz Soundtrack<br /><br />Shake A Body - previously unreleased demo of what became \\"Shake Your Body Down To The Ground\\"<br /><br />Sunset Driver - previously unreleased demo<br /><br />P.Y.T. - previously unreleased demo<br /><br />Someone In The Dark - track from the rarely heard E.T. Storybook<br /><br />State Of Shock - duet with Mick Jagger (!) from The Jacksons last album Victory<br /><br />Scared of the Moon - previously unreleased demo<br /><br />We Are The World - previously unreleased demo<br /><br />We Are Here To Change The World - from Captain EO (previously unreleased)<br /><br />Cheater - previously unreleased demo<br /><br />Dangerous - previously unreleased alternate version<br /><br />Monkey Business - previously unreleased<br /><br />Who Is It (IHS Mix) - rare remix<br /><br />Someone Put Your Hand Out - rare promotional song (first time on CD)<br /><br />On The Line - from the \\"Get On The Bus\\" soundtrack<br /><br />Fall Again - previously unreleased demo<br /><br />In The Back - previously unreleased<br /><br />Beautiful Girl - previously unreleased demo<br /><br />The Way You Love Me - previously unreleased<br /><br />We've Had Enough - previously unreleased<br /><br />That's 14 completely brand new tracks never heard before and 8 that were previously very hard to come by.  These 22 tracks alone (a full album of material) make this set worth the purchase for any MJ fan.  It's surprising that these demos and completed songs never saw the light of day until now considering the high caliber of the work.  If this is any indication of the songs MJ has in the vault, I'd love to hear more - lots more.<br /><br />No matter if you only have one or two MJ CDs, are a rabid fan or are just interested in finding out what al the fuss is about, this is the set for you.  Sony did an amazing job with this set and Michael (a real perfectionist) should be commended for his bravery in releasing demos.

B0002S94OS|5.0|With their last effort \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" having now sold over a 100,000 copies, it's no surprise that Lamb Of God have attracted major label attention. Epic Records, who also recently snatched up Eighteen Visions, caught onto this and as a result, \\"Ashes Of The Wake\\" now serves as the bands 'major-label debut.' Alongside their peers in Killswitch Engage and Shadows Fall, Lamb Of God have quickly risen to the top of the much-touted 'new wave of American heavy metal' movement and \\"Ashes Of The Wake\\" is an unforgivingly virulent offering that clearly shows why. <br /> <br />The first thing that stands out while listening to this album is the production. Lamb Of God have always been a band plagued by lackluster production and finally this issue has been rectified. Helmed by Machine, the material on hand has a satisfyingly heavy depth to it, with the drums especially getting the proper hard-hitting treatment. Production aside, the group have yet to tone down their sound and the major label involvement has had no noticeable ill effect on it. Filled with the same brutish snarls, thrashy searing riffs and double-kick laden drumming the band have come to be known for, this is exactly what one what would expect from these Virginians. But while the attitude of the material remains on the same venomous course, there is a considerable element of refinement on hand. <br /> <br />Everything the band do now feels more pronounced, giving their latest evolutions more punch. Utilizing a considerable amount of spoken word, colorful riffing and rigid song structures, the group have crafted a rather sinister sounding album that thrives on causing as much damage a 200 foot tall demon wielding sledgehammers. In fact, the only real drawback here for some will be the somewhat repetitious riffing as the band are relentless with their shredding. Of course, they do offset this by implementing a rigorous amount of breakdowns and part changes; but it can begin to blur after a few songs in. Regardless, this is a minor complaint and an issue that will likely only affect the more fickle metal fans. While others have softened their approach, adding more singing than screaming or blatantly plundered all that is 'old-school', Lamb Of God have instead stayed true to their modern thrash roots. As a result, there's no denying that \\"Ashes Of The Wake\\" is easily the most crushing of the latest output from the leaders of the new movement; and God (or Satan) willing, the album that catapults them to the stardom they unquestionably deserve.

B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a beginning to start where X-tina's or Christina is at now. She's trying to ditched the negative images that's beside her and switch it to positive. That's a blessing to her. I love the way she trying to find something new in her life and put it into her music. I know I'm a big fan to her now and don't even care what people says about her. Christina I love you and you keep it up. Never try to give up on what you're doing. Just do what you think is right. <br /> <br />I actually gonna say that I don't have her CD but I will one day when I go by the store or whatever to go cop it. I been recently been hearing a lot or a few snippets of it first just whenever it'll be interesting. I know a lot of times people would go out and buy it so quickly w/o listening to the snippets first. First you had to understand you had to take real seriously I mean very wisely when you buy a CD which is good for you. That's how I did it. I first learn this, \\"You know what, I ain't had time to get this CD yet, but I may hear a few songs or so just whether I would love to buy it.\\" <br /> <br />Now that I old enough and still have a job, I know I'm ready. You know Christina tells a lot of stories that's goin behind her just like people are who are dealing with what I have i.e. depression, suicide, friendship, fear, loss, self-control, etc... <br />I 'member the time when I watch her do her thing and tell all she has to do and say in life is to never look back. First of all, we need to take the time to realize on where we going thru in life. <br /> <br />Like for instance, if there's a lot of people who don't care or really don't pay attention about who you are, you need to step back and walk away or else just ignore it. My most love for her is she's all grown up now and she has a more mainstream image like she did on her 1st album which is quite good for me. I think she's gonna be around for a very long time. <br /> <br />Anyway, long period short, songs incl. I liked are: Dirrty, Beautiful, Fighter, Impossible (whom she did w/ Alicia Keys which is my hero), and especially I haven't listen yet since I download them. Anyway, you gotta go get this CD 'cuz a lot of people are missing a lot of good stuff she's talking about. So you need to get your head up on something and focus on the real Christina Aguilera.  <br /> <br />This album is a blend of R&B, pop, jazz, blues, rock, latin and little 'mo neo-soul to it. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|What other band is still around after 25 years and still has the original lineup AND still creates great music? <br />I find that \\"Bomb\\" has more focus and drive than \\"All that you can't leave behind\\". There are some gems on \\"Bomb\\". \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", \\"All Because of You\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Yahweh\\" to name a few. I haven't forgotten \\"Vertigo\\". I've heard that song at least 40 times and I'm still not sick of it. That's a hard thing to do these days. <br />U2 isn't trying to recapture the glory days of \\"Joshua\\" and \\"Achtung\\". So don't expect that when you hear this CD. What you will hear are terrific guitar solos and strong backup and great lyrics. U2 fans will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000IL1K|4.0|I love her classical, operatic performances, however I'm not much of a fan of her pop-ish, new age songs. That being said, this is still a wonderful album. I can't help but congratulate her for making a version of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" that I can tolerate, much less enjoy.
B000001DTM|5.0|If not THE best (sorry Nirvana). Just go out and get it!
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Don't expect a horror movie. Don't expect the film to follow the original stories. Hell, don't even expect good dialogue or acting. Regardless, this film is thoroughly enjoyable unles you happen to be an elitist movie monster \\"guru\\" with stick-up-ass syndrome. It's a fun movie, and great for an occasional much-needed dose of corny goodness.
B00000J7SS|5.0|Miles began recording \\"Bitches Brew\\" the same weekend Woodstock was held. What was in the air that weekend I wonder? <br />The famous journalist Ralph J.

B0006213WG|3.0|I liked this cd up until the bitter end, which I heard from some friends was the best song on the album. To my suprise, it was a rather shameless MetallicA ripoff, with the vocals, solo, and riffs ripped off from \\"battery\\" and riffs stonlen from \\"blackened\\" and \\"trough the never\\" (download those three songs and prove me wrong). Anyways, all I can say is, cool album guys, a bit les poppy than your last one, just try to be a bit more original next time k?
B00000DRXM|5.0|I listened to the re-mastered version of Blizzard of Ozz and I agree with the previous reviewers: the new mix compromises the strength of the original recording. However, my review is based on the original recording, which I believe is a landmark Metal album.  <br />Released in 1980, Blizzard was an unprecedented commercial and musical success for Ozzy. Blizzard also introduced to the world the brilliant and influential guitar work of Randy Rhoads, which set a new standard in guitar virtuosity. Blizzard is as much of an Ozzy album as it is a Randy album.  <br /> <br />Here is my review by song: <br /> <br />I Don't Know - The backward-recorded gong is the dramatic opening to one of Ozzy's classics. The combination of killer riffs and solos contradicted with a melodic middle eventually become an Ozzy trademark copied later by many other metal bands. <br /> <br />Crazy Train - THE classic Ozzy track. A great example of why legions of Randy fans still consider him one of the best guitarists ever. Randy's fierce distortion doesn't stop us from hearing every single note. His riffs, solo, tone, speed, and clarity of playing are unparalleled. If there's any song that represents Ozzy and Randy at their best, it is this song. <br /> <br />Goodbye to Romance - Ozzy shows us his sensitive side with this ballad, bidding farewell to his old band and moving on. The song ends with a beautiful keyboard outro. <br /> <br />Dee - A short classical piece that Randy wrote for his mom. In 1980, who would have expected this from an Ozzy album? Another small milestone.  <br /> <br />Suicide Solution - A song that Ozzy wrote for the late singer of AC/DC. This song would later become one of the targets of PMRC (Parent's Music Resource Center founded by Tipper Gore - Senator Al Gore's wife) and a reason for creating the warning labels on albums. Ozzy had to pay dearly by appearing in court for years for misinterpretation of this song by families that blamed this song for their children's suicide.  Suicide is also the only song on the album without a solo. However, Randy more than made up for the missing solo with his awesome solo in the live shows. Check it out on the \\"Tribute\\" album. <br /> <br />Mr. Crowley - Another Ozzy classic about the life of the controversial Satanist, Aliester Crowley. It features a great keyboard intro and two killer solos by Randy. <br /> <br />No Bone Movies - Randy shows his versatility as a guitarist by delivering some slide guitar on this otherwise average song. <br /> <br />Revelations (Mother Earth) - Revelations is a song about how society is destroying the earth. Randy's classical influences are highlighted in this song followed by an intense solo. One of my favorites. <br /> <br />Steal Away (the Night) - Randy's intro riff to this song is as cool as it is innovative. It is signature Randy Rhoads that involves some intricate guitar playing.  <br /> <br /> <br />

You get a great set of bonus material - photos, lyrics, bios, three promotional videos (including the excellent, dark and scary \\"Strip The Soul\\") and three great bonus tracks - \\"Chloroform\\", which appeared on the album \\"Recordings\\" in its stereo form; the intricate and ultra-heavy \\"Futile\\" which appeared on a rare promo EP (and will be on the upcoming album) and \\"Drown With Me\\", yet another fantastic addition to the Wilson pop pantheon. <br /> <br />But the main treat here is the full DTS mix of _In Absentia_ and even if the music doesn't move you, the exploitation of the surround medium will.  Too often bands throw cheap 5.1 mixes of their songs as extras which only end up adding a little extra presence and room ambience to the music.  _In Absentia_ is mixed with great care and will exhibit some fantastic positioning and a truly exciting music experience on well-set-up surround systems.  Porcupine Tree's highly-structured, yet accessible prog is the sort that's made to be experienced like this.  Listening will reveal and give an entirely new perspective on the intricacies of Wilson's vocal arrangements, especially on the stunning \\"3\\" and \\"Drown With Me\\".  \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" is one of the standouts, perhaps one of the best 5.1 mixes i've ever heard; It envelops the listener with layers of guitar, cascading bass harmonics lulling one into an uneasy peace, eerie ambient mechanical noises which travel out of all corners of the room and Richard Barbieri's incredible swirling keyboard work which travels all over your room.  The normal surround mix seems to exhibit more positioning at the expense of some ofthe power of the music, but again, will reveal sometimes hidden details of the music that you weren't quite able to suss with the normal LP.  This is, like King Crimson's *still* superlative _Deja Vrooomm_, a reference DVD to tax, test and push your surround systems with, and will be greatly admired by audiophiles, as well as treasured by already-fans of the band.
B00008CLOA|4.0|pink floyd has shown you music, now listen to it. this is not what you are looking for if you want pink floyd, this is the vaccum of mainstream sucking pink floyd into their evil grasp. the cd is good, yes, but it is not pink floyd.
B00005JMUL|2.0|by [...] <br /> <br />The Polar Express proves that the Teflon-coated, post-Bonfire of the Vanities career of Tom Hanks is starting to shred its protective lining. After the so-so Ladykillers and the sugary The Terminal, Hanks bonded again with gumpy buddy Robert Zemeckis to turn (or, \\"Potterize\\") a lovely Christmas story into an overblown commercial for books, toys video games and tree ornaments.  <br /> <br />When you figure out the story of The Polar Express, you realize that it would have worked better as a shorter TV movie. The main character, a young boy called \\"boy,\\" is at the age when his belief in Santa Claus fades. On Christmas Eve a magical passenger train, the you-know-what express. appears outside his house, and he is whisked away to the North Pole to meet the one and only Jolly Fat Man.  <br /> <br />Zemeckis, a semi-delusional special effects wonk (Death Becomes Her, oh, you forgot about that film already...) decided to use motion capture to create actors that could pass for, well, above average video game targets. Hanks is cast as five characters: the boy, his father, the conductor, Santa Claus and a magical train hobo who was neither in the book nor adds anything to the heart of the story.  <br /> <br />The look of the film is spectacular, but then Zemeckis had the wonderful book illustrations to scan in and Photoshop scenes from. The motion capture work is amazing, and that may be this film's only saving grace. It's too much of a roller-coaster ride and too little of a heartfelt journey.
B000002A3T|5.0|this cd is the best pink floyd cd ever. with everyone raving over the darkside of the moon (one of the worst pink floyd cds), there has to be a cd that proves you are a true pink floyd fan, id say either this or meddle would be that cd. this cd has a lot of amazing guitar and holds to the constant pink floyd lyrical theme. it comes highly recommended.
B00005JNDX|3.0|Is Renee Zellweger a decent actress? Some people either love her or hate her. Yes, she did get Marcia Gay Harden's (Mystic River) Oscar for Cold Mountain, but like a late comedian, she still ain't got no respect. In Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, she proves that she's a fine actress who can expertly portray the insecure title character, overcoming a weaker story line than the original Bridget Jones' Diary. <br /> <br /> <br />The new film picks up six weeks after the first. Bridget, suffering what seems to be a 24/7 inadequacy attack, breaks up with laywer/beau Mark. Just then, as it does in the hundreds of Bridget Jones type stories/novels (with titles like More Than My Heart Dropped to the Floor or The Goddess of Terminal Guilt) a new paramour drops in, Daniel, (Hugh Grant), who plays the biker dude to Mark's stuffy homebody. Bridget will have to choose between the two men, a trip to Thailand, and, oh yes, of how insecure she wants to be for the rest of her life. <br /> <br /> <br />The beautiful thing about Renee Zellweger as Bridget Jones is her typicalness. She's fat, makes social gafes and is forever talking to herself. There are times when her monologues seem overplayed, but her insecurity rings true. She's the partner we might end up with after the initial honeymoon period in any relationship passses, and in that way she has loads of company.
B00006AFUR|5.0|they are very pure metal. no screaming. usually a two guitar body. they are perfect for people who like heavy music but hate high pitched singers or screamers.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Look, I haven't heard everything.  And I'm not an expert.  But this is my favorite album - if you can't enjoy \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" then I just don't understand you.  There's so much here, the rocking numbers like the one I've mentioned and \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" but there're also songs like \\"Desolation Row\\" that are just so rich and full of allusions to, well, to everything and that capture that moment in time so well, when the 60s became the 70s and when people started to think \\"maybe it won't work out, after all.\\"  I've been living a line from \\"just like tom thumb's blues\\" for a few years now.  And the title track is about as exciting as it gets.  And let's not forget the wonderful \\"train\\" and \\"queen jane.\\"<br /><br />If you like Bob Dylan's music, or if you even think you might like it, and you haven't heard this album, then there is something wrong with you.  This is it, the greatest american rock musician never was any better than he is here.
B00009V7T2|5.0|theyve managed to get the f*** away from that at the drive in stuff enough to make sense. they have kept their vocals pretty high and very extreme. the guitar is very stylistic and jazzy but put under very heavy and flanged effects. their music is almost a jazz and hardcore mix. its very strange but very good. id recommend it to anyone with an open mind
B00000FC5H|5.0|This CD has all the great hits that bring back so many memories of Earth, Wind, and Fire, such as \\"Shining Star,\\" \\"That's the Way of the World,\\" \\"September,\\" \\"After the Love is Gone,\\" \\"Sing a Song,\\" \\"Let's Groove,\\" \\"Got to Get You Into My Life,\\" \\"Boogie Wonderland,\\" \\"Reasons,\\" \\"Getaway,\\" and \\"Saturday Nite.\\" The generous compilation, coupled with a wonderful, remastered sound, makes this a great buy for fans of great soul music. Earth, Wind, and Fire is one of the best 70's soul bands and this CD collection is a great introduction to their classic songs. Highly recommended!!
B000006TRV|4.0|this cd is a lyrical work of art, but it does not show the musical talent of pink floyd. it has a lot of very good piano and bass but it lacks the amazing guitar licks thats are part of most other cds. id recomend this cd to anyone who has already gotten started on pink floyd and enjoys the sound, not to a beginner. to a beginner id say darkside.
B0006399FS|3.0|I am an avid U2 fan and I own all of their CDs. I waited for HTDAAB with eager anticipation, since I really loved their last one, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\"  I was disappointed that there were no catchy songs, on par with \\"Beautiful Day,\\" \\"Walk On,\\" \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of, and \\"Kite.\\"  The ones on HDTAAB that came close were \\"Vertigo,\\" \\"Crumbs on Your Table,\\" and \\"Yahweh.\\"  These songs reminded me of the songs on \\"Achtung Baby.\\"  Most of the songs did not leave me with any lasting impression.  I was disappointed, but hey, a U2 album is better than anything else out there these days.  Sometimes you can't make a great CD!
B00005JMJG|5.0|A paradoxal drama reminiscent of Spike Jonze's \\"Being John Malkovich\\".  The similarities are not surprising considering Charlie Kauffman's involovement with the writing of both films.  Additionally, director Michel Gondry also worked with Jonze on the three disc set \\"Director's Label\\".   <br /> <br />The film is intuitively guided and bears similarity to \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" in that it is a fascinating exposition in how events in our lives that my seem trivial can actually have an intense eternal impact.  In this award-deserving masterpiece Gondry excells in his direction and passes on to us his unique perspective. <br /> <br />In the footsteps of Robin Williams, Jim Carrey triumphantly continues to march beyond the confines of slapstick comedy into a deeply engaging drama that proves how multi-dimentional his talent is.  This movie moves Carrey's carrer from impressive to Kauffmanesque. <br /> <br />Kate Winslett continues to dazzle us with her diverse acting skills by exposing a free spirit we have not had an opportunity to appreciate in her past works.  In her dramatic flare akin to Rita Hayworth, Winslett brings inspiration and magic to the stew of personas and story lines.  I suspect her role in the newly released \\"Finding Neverland\\" will show yet another side of her talents.   <br /> <br />With a supporting cast including Kirsten Dunst, Elijiah Wood, Tom Wilkinson, and Mark Ruffalo, excellent drama is a guarantee.  As with any intense mind challenging drama-mystery the plot is full of twists, turns, hidden agendas, and sneaking suspicions.  In the end, however, I walked away feeling very satisfied having relearend the basic concept of love and life alike:  You don't know what you've got until it's gone. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004WGAI|5.0|This is a wonderfully romantic story, and an excellent production--who cares if it is low budget?! I am so thrilled they finally brought it to DVD!
B00000099Y|4.0|ive seen all reviews and i most say, i think some people in here have to be crazy. i mean how can you fu***** compare good charlotte and simple plan with TOOL!!!, thats just talking trash. thats like saying that new kids on the block are betetr than guns and roses. people, have a little respect for good music, please dont dare to say things like these. as for this album i have to say its awesome though i gave it a 4 because ive always had a problem with tool, i feel all the songs look alike, they need a little more creativity in that department but anyways these guys rock, maynard has awesome lyrics, the music is awesome. id recommend this album to anybody that likes good music ( i mean if you like good charlotte, dont buy it)
0446678430|5.0|Kiyosaki is an excellent author.  For anyone in search of wealth, this is definitely the place to start.  The lessons found in the Rich Dad series are important concepts that anyone can learn from.  Apply these concepts to your own life and the possibilities are endless.  I also recommend Stop Working by Rohan Hall which guides one through building cash flow and becoming a \\"B\\" and an \\"I\\".
B0006399FS|1.0|I won't buy anything by U2 anymore.  I'm sick and tired of hearing Bono spout off about raising money for the plight of AIDS in Africa.  How about the plight of AIDS right here in the USA????!!!  Keep money in this country.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Many previous reviews has covered widely the virtues of  Madeleine Peyroux. I just want to underline that, even if you use to look for new wonders, this is a voice you won't find easily in your everyday searches. It's something you can almost only find by accident beacause it's so rare. It happened to me when I found it in the Rainer Ptacek tribute (1997 - The Inner Flame) when Madeleine's voice hit me like an instant classic coming from another level. It has something special that goes beyond tone, technique or delivery. It has that special quality that conveys happiness, pain and feelings in a way that only the greatest artists have. You should listen to it. It's magic.
0887306667|5.0|I would recommend The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing whether the reader is interested in marketing or not.  It is a fun and short read.  I especially enjoyed the style in which the book was written.  The authors would introduce the law being addressed in the chapter, give a brief comprehensible definition, and then give two or three real life examples of the law being used, and not being used effectively.  By keeping the book short the authors hace produced a book that is enjoyable and educationally valuable.
0375422889|5.0|Just like Persepolis 1 this story is gripping in its dark and candid descriptions and with the striking contrast between the comic strips presentation and the sordid contents of the tale. However, whereas Persepolis 1 centered on a childhood in Iran, this story seems to go out of the borders of Iran. By this I do not mean only the physical aspect of Marjane moving to another country. The very detailed-specific individual story in Persepolis 1 (which then could have been the sad story of a whole nation) seems to become at times, a very cosmopolite tale of growing up, facing all the problems of our era. Sex, drugs, love, friendships and relations of all kinds, hypocrisy, being true to yourself - all are thrown at your face in a concentrated manner.  <br />Marjane Satrapi bears her soul to us.  She gives us her life, thoughts and dark secrets. She even gives us nasty comic-relief remarks about different people (she does seem certain that she will never meet them again). All is presented to the reader in what becomes a very condensed experience touching so many difficult issues that the reader is not at all surprised by Marjane's breakdown. At the end of Persepolis 1 Marjane left Iran to go to Vienna in what promised to be an escape to a better life. This book centers on her life in Vienna and her return to Iran after four years in Europe. These are the teen-age years where one's personality is shaped up. Marjane has already dealt with war and death in her younger years and now has to deal with teen-age life away from home. This proves to be an experience that is no less difficult then the former. <br />Using very simple black and white sketches Marjane paints a picture of her growing self. Her disproportionate body and the large beauty mark next to her nose that soon becomes her trademark. This is one of her very unique characteristics: she does not beautify anything - on the other hand, everything seems to be centered on showing the reader how bad it was. How crazy the world felt when you are considered modest and an outsider in one place and liberated and again an outsider in another. \\"I experience a great lack of affection,\\" says Marjane to a boy she likes and the reader does not know whether to laugh or cry from his reaction.  <br />In spite of its heavy nature the book is a fast easy read. The reader is drawn to the tale and wants to know how Marjane survived the experiences she has undergone. <br />I loved the joke/story of the soldier returning from the front told to Marjane by her friend Kia which is one of the best parts of the story and holding a lot of the nature of her story - a comically told dark story.  <br />
068987474X|3.0|I like this book.  It was a fun and quick read.  I have a number of friends, both straight and gay, who could benefit from the no-nonsense message of this book.  Everyone needs to learn to \\"qualify\\" the people they choose to date.  You've got to figure out if he/she is \\"into you.\\"  If not, get out before you waste years of your life on a relationship that will never be satisfying.<br /><br />All that said, I disagreed with some of the things the authors present as fact.  For instance, they state that if a guy doesn't ask you out, he's not that into you.  Well, the best relationships that I have had have been with shy men.  They would never have asked me out that first time.  I had to take the initiative, state my interest plainly, and invite them to date me.  Now, if after that, they had not asked me out, then absolutely it would have been an easy conclusion that they were not that into me.  But, in fact, the best of the bunch was so pleased that I approached him that we eventually married and have been happily together for 23 years.  It would never have happened if I hadn't approached him first.<br /><br />So, read this book, enjoy it, learn from it the valuable lesson that you are wonderful and you deserve a lover who knows it.  But don't give up your own power of initiative.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|July 1985, what a year that was! - and that's how this will make you feel. At the time I remember the endless drones of my elders comparing it to Woodstock in the 60's (their generations BIG concert event) and being less than complimentary. This is a very good value DVD set with over 10 hours of music, from some truly HUGE names in the business. OK, so some of the performances are missing, big deal - the main ones are there, including the unforgettable and crowd rowsing Queen set with Freddie Mercury whipping the throng into a frenzy. As others have said, these were bands and artists who cut their teeth in live venues, and without wanting to be to disparaging about a lot of modern bands, these people really CAN sing. Much more than a nostalgia trip, this is a must have for anyone who remembers the actual event, or who likes to wax on about \\"how music used to sound\\". Not many extra's in the set, but the re release creating more revenue for the charity is a nice touch. Probably wasted on a younger audience, but nonetheless an important musical event that has stood the test of time. I wonder if I'll be around in another twenty or thirty years to see a comparable performance that my kids will call their own \\"Big Gig\\". Great DVD at great price, and ideal Christmas gift. Enjoy!
B00005JMAH|5.0|The more I watch this film, the more I enjoy it. When I saw it in theaters, I loved it, but I felt like it moved very fast... Too fast, in fact, during certain important scenes. The exclusion of certain facts from the books is being overblown, as if a whole twist was left out of the movie, which is a bunch of hyperbole. I too think including the bit about the Marauder's Map wouldn't have taken very long, but it's just more information to pack into an already packed film. Another thing that is being overblown is the reaction to the way the movie introduces the Firebolt. No one should be this emotionally attached to an inanimate object. <br /> <br />Prisoner of Azkaban does an infinitely better job than its predecessors at portraying the emotion between characters, and there are no better examples than the scenes between Harry and Lupin. The acting is complemented by the directing, which is complemented by the cinemetography and music (which is also substantially different in PoA than the first two movies). <br /> <br />Michael Gambon, who replaces the late Richard Harris, does a fantastic job at playing the part of Dumbledore, which is much closer to the character in the book than Richard Harris' take on the headmaster was. The trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione is exponentially better. I think this is partially due to the fact that Steve Kolves has gotten better with porting the dialogue over. In the first two films, there were sequences where characters said very blunt things to help explain what was happening on screen; things that were made obvious enough just by the visuals. This only happens once in Prisoner of Azkaban by my count. <br /> <br />I'm thankful Alfonso was at the helm of PoA. He took the films in exactly the right direction, and which a great amount of style. There are a ton of little camera tricks, large sweeping angles, complicated stretches of direction, simple but sensible shots, and a lot of artful editing. Add to that much improved acting and abetter sense of magic to the surroundings, and you've got yourself a much successful adaptation.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Although artistic, indie films are not my usual fare, I LOVED this movie, as well as its predecessor, \\"Before Sunrise\\", which I first encountered on cable back in '95.  It was a great movie about being young and in love.  Two people have a magical night together, and plan to meet again in six months time.  \\"Before Sunrise\\" ended on that note, and being something of a romantic, I always liked to think they both came back as they promised, and got together.<br /><br />This movie finally answers that question.  A rarity among sequels, it manages to equal its predecessor.  \\"Before Sunset\\" follows the same format as the first film.  What makes it work is that the characters really do act like people who have aged a decade.  They're no longer college age kids, but grown, working adults.  In this film they talk more about their experiences than their hopes, ambitions, and desires.  You can see how life has worn some of their idealism off.  This is a great touch of realism.  They're the same characters, but their not really the same people anymore.<br /><br />Well, nine years after their romantic night together, we see that through no fault of theirs, their planned rendezvous in Vienna never happened.  They meet again in Paris, and as the movie progresses, it gradually becomes obvious that neither of them ever really got over the other.  Jesse admits that when he got married, he settled for what he thought would be good enough.  His marriage is not a happy one, and he has only remained in it because of his son, and even so, he worries about his son growing up in a joyless home.  Celine has bounced from one unsatisfying relationship to another, growing more cynical about romance with each one.  The only reason her current boyfriend is still her boyfriend is because his work requires him to travel a lot, so he's not around often enough to get under her skin like the rest of them did.  Celine candidly admits that she feels like she's dying inside, and Jesse tells her his life's even worse.<br /><br />Just as in the first film, they have only a short time to spend together.  Jesse has to catch a plane for New York.  But this brief time is enough to reveal that their old magic is still there, and you can see them falling for each other all over again.  As another reviewer remarked, those who say that this movie ended on an ambiguous note, as the first film did, are missing the subtext.  I think it is no coincidence at all that when Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke chose to feature a song sung by Nina Simone (in a scene near the end, when Jesse plays it on Celine's stereo), the one they chose was \\"Just in Time\\".  You can't hear the lyrics so easily in this film, but if you know this song (I do) you can see that it could be a Cri de Coeur from either character to the other:<br /><br /> Just in time, you've found me just in time.<br />Before you came, my time was running low.<br />I was lost; the losing dice were tossed.<br />My bridges all were crossed. Nowhere to go.<br />Now you're here. Now I know where I'm going<br />No more doubt or fear. I've found my way<br />For love came just in time. You've found me just in time,<br />And changed my lonely nights that lucky day.<br /><br />And when Celine, imitating Nina Simone, says to Jesse: \\"Baby, you are gonna miss that plane.\\" He replies: \\"I know\\".  The way he says it, however, is more like: \\"You're d*** right I am.\\"  They both let \\"the one\\" get away before.  There's no way they're going to let it happen again.<br /><br />Since Jesse and Celine do get their happy ending - or rather, happy beginning - in this film, I really hope they don't make another sequel.  It could only be dramatic if it shows them having a relationship that has some troubles (and who wants to see that?), or if they somehow fail to get together after all, and lose more of their precious, irreplaceable years.  Besides that, I am impressed that they managed to maintain the quality of the first film in a sequel.  I'm not at all sure they could do it again.  Better to leave the characters on a high note.
0446677450|1.0|This is BY FAR THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ IN MY LIFE!!!  I cannot believe that this guy is making so much money selling nothing! <br /> <br />I heard so much about this book, that I decided to buy it and read it on a long flight to South Africa from Atlanta.  By the time that plane landed in Johannesburg, let me tell you - I was quite queasy (not by the terrible SA Airways food, but by the content in the book).  I'm a 2004 MBA grad from a top-20 school, and right off the bat, I could detect some fluff in the book (e.g., insider trading, deducting personal expenses as company expenses, his vacuous comments about avoiding mutual funds and the like because they are \\"too risky\\"), but I didn't dismiss him right away because I thought that maybe I wasn't reading between the lines enough to get the \\"point\\" - remember the children's tale, \\"Emporer's New Clothes\\". <br /> <br />Fortunately, I trusted my instincts and did a little research and found this website (yes, I know we've all heard of it, but nonetheless, you can NEVER overstate the truth) - [...]  People can say whatever they want about John Reed's intentions for his analysis, but the bottom line is that everything he says is the TRUTH - something that the Kiyosaki cultists don't want to concede to.  And reading this analysis, and Kiyosaki's connections with Amway and these other MLM freaks has only enraged me even more that I not only threw away money on something useless, but that there are countless others out there (yes, even other top-20 MBAs) who have been guiled by this unscrupulous charlatan! <br /> <br />The only thing useful that could ever come out of this book is a B-school case study on the effective use of Machiavellian cultism as a tool for marketing - then again, that, too, would give this jerk more money through royalty fees. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  As my title clearly states, AVOID THIS BOOK LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Vol 3 shows a definite sign of growth and isn't the same as the old albums, but that is a good thing.  Another Iowa would just be retarded.  Some would be critical of slipknot softer songs on the album and say they themselves have gone soft but they show a lot more musical talent and creativity than tracks like \\"People=S---\\" off of Iowa.  Vol 3 is by far Slipknot's best album because they have figured out banging heavy-heavy jams 24-7 gets old.  A much better contrast of songs this time around.
B0006399FS|5.0|Okay folks, I've read the bad reviews and I've been listening to the album for two weeks. I have a feeling that the bad reviews are coming mostly from kids ranging anywhere from 14 to 22. These guys have been putting out solid music for three decades and HTDAAB is no exception. This album has songs that conjure up images from all their previous albums, and is so much better than the junk that is playing at a coffee shop near you right now. Who cares if U2 haven't reinvented themselves on this outing, maybe they just wanted to put something out there that wasn't digitally enhanced and readymade for remixing. The bottom line is that if you like U2 you will like this album. With all the crap out there, it's kinda of nice to hear something with a little bit of thought put into it.
B00005V4O5|5.0|\\"Remedy Lane\\" is an album that has challenged me like no other.  When I first got it, over a year ago, I practically hated it.  I could see that they were a band doing something interesting and different from your average band, but for some reason it just didn't strike a chord with me.  But despite my negative reaction, I was bound and determined to get to the bottom of this album.  After countless listens, and tireless efforts, finally its brilliance shone through.  I have never bought an album that has grown on me to the extent that this album has.  Sure, I've gotten stuff that didn't really sit well with me at first, and then I kinda grew to like it more, or I just liked an album, but didn't love it until I listened to it a bit more, but this album has gone from nearly frustrating me to death, to becoming my favorite album of all time.  I will never understand why it took so long to grow on me, but I'm eternally grateful that it did.<br /><br />Daniel Gildenlow's talent is absolutely remarkable.  The way that he brings together so many different musical styles (some that you would think couldn't, and perhaps shouldn't go together), and melds them so seamlessly with this thought-provoking and emotionally affecting concept is just awe-inspiring.  This album is just perfect.  They do everything here, and all of it well.  I've gotten to the point where concept albums have sort of lost their novelty, but Gildenlow writes such mature, personal, and original concepts, that everything else seems tepid and cheesy by comparison.  Combine that with his amazingly versatile voice, which conforms so perfectly to many different styles and feels, and this truly is a work of art.<br /><br />This album does a brilliant job of keeping you on your toes.  Not since Led Zeppelin has a band been able to combine so many different styles, without sounding too weird and unapproachable.  From the dark melodies of \\"Ending Theme\\", to the wacky complexity of \\"Fandango\\", to the playful folk of \\"Chain Sling\\", to the breathtakingly euphoric acoustics of \\"Dryad of the Woods\\", there is a surprise lurking around every corner.  The juxtoposition of the light and fluffy love ballad \\"This Heart of Mine (I Pledge)\\" and the dark, forlorn \\"Undertow\\" is bone-chilling, especially when put into context with the lyrics.  \\"Rope Ends\\" is progressive metal done right, with hard-hitting staccato riffs, and a cool jazzy instrumental section.  \\"A Trace of Blood\\" is just one of the most perfect songs ever.  It has such brilliant flow, and the lyrics are equally touching and unsettling.  This is one of the few 8-minute songs that would lend itself to radio as well as any song of half its length.  It has such great flow, and goes by so fast that you'd never know it's as long as it is.  The two instrumentals, \\"Dryad of the Woods\\" and the title track, are both top notch, and don't detract from the flow of the concept at all.  \\"Dryad of the Woods\\" has powerful buildup that will bring the coldest of hearts to tears, and the brief techno-tinged title track serves as sort of an out-of-sequence overture, bringing back various themes from the album with a wicked dark atmosphere.  \\"Waking Every God\\" is subtly complex, with a catchy and heart-warming melody.  \\"Second Love\\" is pure pop perfection.  Sure, it's simple and straight-forward, but it serves its purpose perfectly.  And, when you consider that Gildenlow was only 11 when he wrote it, it's all the more amazing.<br /><br />The album culminates with the earth-shattering \\"Beyond the Pale\\".  This song really is beyond words.  I can't even begin to describe it.  To even call it a \\"song\\" is almost heresy, as it is much more like an organic musical entity from another dimension, with Gildenlow's commanding vocals booming over it.  This song is so powerful, it's almost dangerous.  When you get to the \\"Come and drown with me, the undertow..\\" part, you will be officially floored, and the haunting repeated phrase \\"We will always be much morehuman than we wish to be\\" could not be a more perfect way to close the album.<br /><br />This album is beyond perfect. It is the greatest collection of music I have ever heard.  Music really couldn't get much more perfect than this.  The instrumentation is complex, but never overbearing, and is always applied to serve the song (even the more instrumental parts, which there aren't too many of, are there for purpose, rather than show).  Gildenlow's vocal range is tremendous, but never distracting (he's done a bit of \\"oversinging\\" in the past, but none to be found here).<br /><br /> I love music more than anything in the world, and I enjoy a multitude of different styles, and this album incorporates practically everything I love and admire about music within 68 minutes.  There is nothing else that compares to this.  All of their music is fantastic, but this is head and shoulders above them all.  I really can't emphasize how great this is, and the fact that this band is pretty much doomed to obscurity is a great shame.  Everyone who really loves and appreciates music deserves to hear this album at least once.  Buy this, please.  You will not regret it.more human than we wish to be\\" could not be a more perfect way to close the album. <br /> <br />This album is beyond perfect.

B0002XVQNU|4.0|This director's ties together loose ends and fixes some flaws that the original version had. Plus the original needed more humor and this version has a lot more due to more scenes with Jon Favreau and Coolio being added to this version. Coolio plays a man that might or might not be innocent and that is defended by Matt Murdock (Ben Afflick). This version also shows even more how this is no doubt Afflick's best work in awhile. I thought he was good in the original version but here he has stronger scenes that take the character further. It's a shame I hear he doesn't want to do a sequel because he is really good in the part. Plus doing a sequel would've been a much better choice than doing Suviving Christmas. Wasn't that in the movies for like 2 days ?<br /><br />  Anyway there's a lot of strong scenes added that should've stayed in the original. Plus some things change in this version. In the original Afflick stays with Garner's character on the roof in the rain and ignores someone screaming. Then that's followed by a sex scene. Here he says sorry he has to leave and actually leaves and there is no sex scene. So their romance is trimmed down a little but this version also shows that the sex scene wasn't needed. That sex scene was a flaw in the original I realize after seeing this version too. I mean think about it, Murdock is obsessed with justice so he wouldn't just stay with her on the roof and ignore someone in trouble. So this version is much smarter and stronger. If they released this version in theaters I think it would've been compared to Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2 as one of the best super hero movies.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|Let's see: Erica Berry (played full out by Diane Keaton in a role to die for) is a successful playwright with a beautiful daughter (Amanda Peet) and at least one very fine bosom buddy (Frances McDormand).  Along comes Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson, 66) in his PJ's or underwear-I forget which--to be discovered behind the opened door of her refrigerator (\\"Boy Meets Girl--Cute,\\" as they say in Hollywood).  Turns out he is dating her twenysomething daughter Marin.  Well, gee, what a guy.<br /><br />However daughter and man about town have not yet consummated their relationship; indeed when they try, Viagra Harry has a heart attack.  And now the plot thickens.  Enter handsome, dashing, young and very eligible Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) who tells Harry that he can't go anywhere yet because they need to keep a close watch on his heart.  So Erica ends up babysitting him.  Ah, yes we can see where this one is going.  Playboy of the Western World finally but finally gives up the young stuff, meets the love of his life (Erica), and falls clumsily, but hopelessly in love with her.<br /><br />For Erica, who hasn't felt a man's touch for lo these many years, it's like electrifying.  Ah, but here's the rub.  The old bachelor can't comprehend his feelings.  After all he has never but never dated anyone over thirty before, and the prospect of COMMITMENT is way scary.  So he demurs, shall we say.  Meanwhile, the dashing young doctor reveals his romantic and clearly carnal interest in--no, NOT the beautiful young daughter!  How prosaic would that be?  No, he reveals he has quite a yen for the great playwright herself, and age does not matter in the slightest!<br /><br />Okay, at this point if I were a woman of any age I would say that my cup doth runneth over.  I would also suspect that this Fantasyland is a bit much for belief.  But hey, why should the starlets have all the fun?<br /><br />Anyway, Nancy Meyers's direction of this self-authored fairytale will appeal to its targeted audience no doubt, but don't try to screen this for your boyfriend.  He won't survive the first reel.<br /><br />Incidentally, this flick is not even in the same league as the somewhat similar romantic comedy, As Good As It Gets (1997) starring Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, which I recommend that you see instead.  Jack and Diane give it their best here-and Keaton is very good--but the lame and cloying script defeats their efforts.try to screen this for your boyfriend.  He won't survive the first reel.

B00000GV55|4.0|Henry Cow's music on this their first album is a rethinking of both progressive rock, its symphonic pretentions, rock and improvised music. It's radical and revolutionary.  The Cow mix both incredibly complex composed pieces with stretches of improvised rock and jazz-like interplay that continually challenge the listener. You're taken on quite a wild ride with Geoff Leighs woodwinds, Fred Friths guitar, viola, the unconventional drumming of Chris Cutler, John Greaves nimble bass playing and the keyboards of Tim Hogkinson. The music is difficult and sometimes perhaps overly ambitious, but never boring. The album is almost entirely instrumental.  The one piece with vocals is the Nine Funerals of the Citizen King and after hearing that one you'll know why they didn't sing on any of the other tracks. Henry Cow were trying to throw off convention and forge their own path and for the most part are successful with Leg End, their first album.  They may have gotten better with subsequent albums such as the superb \\"Concerts\\" but this is a wonderful beginning and only gets 4 stars because of what was to come.<br /><br />This CD, the original mix, is the one to buy.  DO NOT BUY THE REMIX. It sucks because the remixers radically changed the dynamics between the instruments and added reverb over everything ruining what is an essential album of early '70s art rock.
B0001611DI|5.0|If this movie wasn't as original as it is i would have givin it four stars but since it seems to be the first of the whole zombie apocalypse now movies it deffinately gets the five.<br /><br />For its time not only does this movie have great action scenes, gory parts, rather good acting the story line is the best i have seen in any other zombie movies, all previous ones seem to be find there's a zombie and try to run away or kill him, this it what makes this movie so spectaculer it presents the whole zombie concept in a whole new way.<br /><br />Two soldiers survive an encounter with a great number of zombies in a hotel, they later meat up with a couple and drop in on a mall in their helicopter where they stay, after being stuck in there for a while they go downstairs to take on the zombies in order to get new weopons, food and other leisure things. Over the tv they view all the havoc the zombies are reaking in the outside world.<br /><br />If your after a good original horror then this film is for you.
B0002YLC24|1.0|I *loved* Before Sunrise and was cautiously optimistic that the sequel would be as excellent. <br /> <br />But the dialogue drags (when it's not being PC and pedantic) and the notion that it's romantic to leave your wife and child to take up with the hottie you lft behind bugs me too much. <br /> <br />Julie Delpy's talents wasted.  Ethan Hawke indulging his politics to inject an anti-gun message in a yawner of a film. <br /> <br />PLEASE rent this one before you buy!
B000006054|5.0|What more could you ask for in a spoken word cd(?):  Allen Ginsberg reading some of his best work!  This cd is a wonderful introduction to the man's work (and beat-poetry in general), and because all the poems are performed by Ginsberg himself, even scholars will appreciate it.  \\"Howl\\" is, arguably, the most important poem of the 20th century (or at least the second half of the 20th century) on a literary and cultural level.  The other poems here are good too, most notably \\"America.\\" There are plenty of spoken-words cds available out there with people other than Ginsberg reading his work...but most of them are laughably melodramatic and don't capture the poignancy and laid-back spice that his voice does.
B00005J6T1|4.0|I'm not one for 80s music in general, but this album has held up surprisingly well over the years. It displays a Madonna before she decided to put any kind of message or controversy in her music. This music is all fluff, plain and simple. But there is no denying it's entertaining. <br />Lucky Star: 4/5 This track is bubbly and playful. It's nothing special, but nothing to scoff at. <br />Borderline: 4/5 For some reason I think if Elton John had sung this it would have been better. Not bad. <br />Burning Up: 5/5 My favorite track. It's sexy and driven. It just makes you want to roll around in reckless abandon. <br />I Know It: 5/5 Another Winner. It's a lost Madonna gem. <br />Think of Me: 3/5 Don't really like this one much. It's whiny and employs a lame saxophone solo. <br />Physical Attraction: This one's catchy, but it just goes on forever. It's nearly 7 minutes long. <br />Everybody: 5/5 Another great song. It's a great way to end the album. It was also Madonna's first single. <br />This album is for 80s dance music buffs and Madonna fans. It's also has a place in audiophiles hearts as it became a pivitol moment in pop music history.
B0000B1OFL|1.0|Absolute rubbish<br /><br />Awful, embarrassing acting that makes you wince<br /><br />Why make a remake of a classic sixties cult film?<br /><br />This is dire. Even the modern minis arent as good as orginals
0743424425|4.0|King's first novels were undoubtably his best.  Out of those, I must say that The Shining is truly a standout.  What makes it most chilling is that it's told mostly from the perspective of a child who knows too much.  In this book, King is able to give us a fast-paced story without excessive character development.  I would call this more suspense than horror.  Either way, it's a dang good read.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Lovers of great acting had best not pass up \\"Mystic River,\\" Clint Eastwood's powerful, award-laden adaptation of Dennis Lehane's best-selling novel.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon play three working class Bostonians forever bound together by a mutual childhood tragedy that has since gone on to define the kind of people they`ve become and the kind of lives they`ve led.  The film begins with a brief prologue as we see the three youngsters - Jimmy, Sean and Dave - out playing in the street one day, when they are confronted by a pedophile who, posing as a policeman, tricks one of them, Dave, into getting into the car with him and another man.  Fast forward to the present as we pick up the trio as grown men who have, for all intents and purposes, gone their separate ways.  Penn is Jimmy Markum, a former petty thief who spent two years in the slammer but who has since turned straight and now owns a neighborhood liquor store.  When Jimmy's daughter from his first marriage turns up murdered, the three men's lives intersect in ways they could never have imagined.  Bacon is Sean Divine, a homicide detective assigned to the case, and Robbins is Dave Boyle, a sporadically employed man who may be a prime suspect in the murder.  Dave still lives with the trauma of that earlier soul-shattering experience, while Jimmy and Sean wrestle with why they managed to escape the cruel finger of fate that pointed so grimly at their hapless playmate.  The film is about how the events of our early lives (and, in the case of Jimmy, it doesn't stop at this one incident) can end up coming back to haunt us later down the road.<br /><br />The Brian Helgeland screenplay makes the pain that each of these men experiences vivid and palpable.  The grief Jimmy feels over the loss of his beloved child, the psychological torment Dave suffers as a result of his abuse, and the bewilderment and loneliness Sean experiences from a failed marriage all become integral to this dark tale of bitterness, revenge and attempted healing.  At times, we do find ourselves wishing that the script would concentrate less on the details of the murder investigation and more on the inner workings of the three main characters.  Too often we feel as if we are only scratching the surface of the roiling psychological torment taking place deep in the bowels of these men.  The plotting, particularly towards the end, often feels more contrived than it needs to be, with heavy-handed ironies and obtruding parallelisms that don`t seem to know when to leave well enough alone.  Laura Linney, as Jimmy's second wife, has a key Lady Macbeth moment late in the film that might have been effective had we been more fully prepared for it and had her character been more thoroughly developed throughout the course of the film.  As it is, the scene seems to come out of nowhere and leaves us both bewildered and hanging.<br /><br />Still, these are minor quibbles when it comes to a movie as finely acted and directed as this one is.  Penn hits all the right notes as a man facing the worst experience life could possibly throw at a person - the murder of one's child - trying to make sense of a tragedy that defies any rational explanation.  Robbins beautifully underplays the role of a man scarred forever by what happened to him in his youth, now endeavoring to function as an adult when he was robbed of any semblance of a childhood.  Bacon is excellent as the man who attempts to put all the pieces together, not only of the case but of the shattered lives he and his two buddies have been living all these years, and Marcia Gay Harden is outstanding as Dave's loving wife who struggles with what is perhaps the greatest moral dilemma faced by any character in the movie.  Linney, Lawrence Fishburne and Tom Guiry offer fine supporting performances.<br /><br />As director, Eastwood allows his superb cast ample time to develop their characters, never hurrying the proceedings along and always allowing the conversations to play themselves out.  He recognizes the quality of the material and feels no need to gussy it up with self-conscious camera angles or fancy editing.  He also uses the bleak settings of blue collar Boston as an effective backdrop to the stark, chilly tale he is telling.<br /><br />Perhaps it is just an odd coincidence that three of the very best movies of 2003 - \\"21 Grams,\\" \\"The House of Sand and Fog\\" and \\"Mystic River\\" - all suffer from the same tendency on the part of the filmmakers to move away from reality and towards melodrama and contrivance in the final act.  Of the three, \\"21 Grams\\" and \\"The House of Sand and Fog\\" are harmed less by this than \\"Mystic River\\" because they have a somewhat deeper thematic base and richer character development than does the Eastwood film.  Still, \\"Mystic River\\" is a mighty impressive achievement for those who made it and a rich, memorable experience for those who see it.ing the conversations to play themselves out.

B00005OWEG|5.0|First time I watched this, the thing I liked the most was Robert Duvall's brilliant performance of surf-lover colonel Bill Kilgore. Then when I saw he was gone I was expecting his return throughout the film...never happened, but the film got pretty interesting...that's when I realized why it was called a masterpiece. <br /> <br />I was thrilled for what I saw and Brando hadn't even appeared yet...the helicopter attack with the Wagner classical music is one of the most beautifully filmed scenes I've seen. <br /> <br />Then when Marlon Brando appeared as crazed Walter E. Kurtz...what a twist for the story that started as a normal war movie with amazing helcopter attacks and turned into primitive men leadered by Marlon Brando...that was one hell of a ride. <br /> <br />If you want to experience 3 1/2 hours of some brilliant cinematography, great helicopter attacks, the amazing Marlon Brando with his face painted green and especially Robert Duvall giving cinema one of the coolest movie characters ever...watch this.
B00005J6T0|3.0|I am a true blue Madonna fan, and this album is perhaps my least favorite of all her major studio releases. It hasn't held up well, and the dance tracks lack the cute bite of her previous two albums. There are some immortal tracks on here, but the rest is pretty generic. <br />Papa Don't Preach: 5/5 This is an awesome song. Lord knows why it was controversial. She had sex. She got pregnant. Happens everyday. But that's what Madonna does best. She holds up a mirror and we all freak out at our reflections. <br />Open Your Heart: 4/5 This song is fairly generic, but I'm giving it 4 stars because I'm generous. Can't handle myself really. Just give it all away. <br />White Heat: 3/5 This song is boring. The fact that it is supposed to be clever and nostalgic with all that James Cagney stuff makes it kind of sad. <br />Live to Tell: 5/5 This song is beautiful and haunting. It is more than a ballad. It's a creepy ballad. And that's one heck of an adjective. <br />Where's the Party?: 3/5 Boring and repetitive. It gets fairly annoying after she screams \\"WHERE'S\\" for the 10th time. <br />True Blue: 5/5 This is my favorite song on here and one of my favorite Madonna songs. It is an obvious tribute to 60s girl groups, but it outdoes most of the songs of that era.  It's the most joyful Madonna song yet.   <br />La Isla Bonita: 4/5 This has a neat latin premise, but it really never goes anywhere. <br />Jimmy, Jimmy: 3/5 This song is annoying and dangerously peppy. <br />Love Makes the World Go Round: 3/5 Sure the message is nice. It's one of the first 'Madonna with a Message' tracks in existance. And it's lame. Poor way to end. <br />Buy this album for Papa Don't Preach, Live to Tell, and True Blue. Otherwise, just buy it for the hot cover picture. Yummy.
6302491940|5.0|Forget the rotten remake, this is a classic caper <br />Excellent \\"cockney\\" Londoner acting, some inspired scripts and charming comedy moments <br />The English Mr Big in prison is cool <br />Great ending as well
0440238609|4.0|Just like anyone else, I liked the Harry Potter series, but I really thought this series of books was much more intelligent.  The protagonist(s) really get to your heart, and the story is fast-paced and interesting.  I think this would make a good read for anyone who loved the Harry Potter series.  It will also make a great present for anyone who likes to read.  These books are appropriate for both older children and any adult.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Some people might disagree, but I think this record has better songs and is more developed and durable than XO. It is certainly not a retread of that album. While XO was a great step forward for him, and an awesome record for any artist, I truly believe Smith progressed further on this one. The electric guitar play and harmonies are less typical and more challenging this time around, the harmonies & melodies are sublime, the lyrics are in your face, and I can listen to this CD again and again without getting bored.
B000003TA4|5.0|Pretty much everyone has heard this full album and given more than a million different opinions. <br /> <br />Here goes my opinion: <br />This extremely overplayed masterpiece that came out in 1991 and drove America and the world crazy starting a raving wave of Nirvana-mania is amazing and deserves all the respect that it has. However, this album is pretty much for those casual Nirvana fans who haven't heard Nirvana's other stuff and feel that \\"Nevermind\\" is Nirvana's greatest achievement. This album was made to get into the \\"popular\\" music ground and it did, it became insanely popular but this is not the essence of Nirvana, if you want to experience Nirvana's truest feeling, check out \\"In Utero\\", \\"Bleach\\" or \\"Incesticide\\". <br />I'm not putting this album down, I love this thing, I know every song and will probably listen to this a thousand more times but as my review title says...this is not the MUSICALLY TRUE NIRVANA. <br />Thanks for reading.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|The album that made Madonna a star did so because of 3 things. The title, the cover, and it was when we finally realized who Madonna was, and that alone could make her a star. Her sexy, powerful, rebellious personality and the Boy Toy belts and writhing on MTV make this album the landmark it is today. Other than that, it's just really fun music to listen to. <br />Material Girl: 5/5 It's irresistably fun and the message is in your face shallow, proving that subtlety is the only way to preach. <br />Angel: 5/5 It took me awhile to get over Madonna's Satanic cackle at the beginning of this track, but I gave in eventually and love every second. <br />Like A Virgin: 4/5 As a Madonna fan it may be blasphemous to say so, but I don't really care for this song. I like it much better in the sexy, oriental version she used on her Blonde Ambition tour. <br />Over and Over: 5/5 You just can't help loving it. Or making silly puns based on it. <br />Love Don't Live Here Anymore: 5/5 This is the only song on the album that has any real emotional strength. In fact, it is still one of Madonna's most empassioned recordings. I love it. <br />Dress You Up: 5/5 Is this song about a transvestite? If it is, I'm impressed. It manages to be open-minded and entertaining at the same time. If not, it's still open-minded, which is just fine. <br />Shoo-Bee-Doo: 3/5 This is the only song that Madonna wrote solo, and it's my least favorite. She's written good songs alone before like \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"Everybody\\" but this one's lame. <br />Pretender: 5/5 There's nothing intelligent to say about this. <br />Stay: 5/5 Or this <br />If you can't handle the fact that she's gonna talk about sex, Madonna's not your woman. So go make babies somewhere else. <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|I'm lovin' this CD, it's so much fun jammin' to all of Britney's great songs! From her sweet songs back in the old days, to her sexy new stuff.  The bonus CD is great too, especailly the megamix.
B0002MB7QW|4.0|I give this movie 4 stars.  Looking over some of the other reviews, one might wonder why? <br /> <br />The beginning of the movie provides and immediate suspense, three men researching something in a very very cold place: Antarctica.  The ice begins to crack - and action ensues. <br /> <br />Then the only real issue with this movie becomes apparant.  And while it's only one real issue, it's a whopper.  Time is *never* given.  The day, is *never* given.  The best we can work with are the rare cues of \\"a few days ago\\" or \\"yesterday\\" or \\"it'll take x hours\\"... in which case, was that really a few days ago?  I mean.. perhaps the speaker forgot? (trust me, when you hear this line, you will understand). <br /> <br />Aside from time passing at a pace that is never provided, this is a good movie.  The story itself is perhaps a bit... well, overdone - but the ending makes up for it.  I will not spoil it, but at the very least it's not the same cliche ending. <br /> <br />Also, the special effects were pretty spectacular at times.  Even the ravenous wolves looked real now and again. <br /> <br />I haven't read the book, but I believe it will likely be far better.  The movie seemed like it had so much to say, and didn't have a lot of time to say it.  Things like, as I mentioned, time itself.  Also the fleshing out of characters (like the homeless guy) wasn't all done very well in the movie. <br /> <br />If you really want to be entertained with this particular story of doom, I would advise you to read the book - it likely fills in what the movie felt as if it lacked.  Oddly, half of this movie is set in a library... <br /> <br />However, for those with schedules that do not allow the reading of a book, this movie is worth the price.
B00000JLWW|5.0|it makes me wonder why so many people hate the movie Titanic. true, everyone has watched 13 or more times, and it is so talked about it can get a bit tiring, but there is nothing wrong with the movie itself. for one a lot of people complain about the script being so bad, but i don't see anything wrong with it, anyway, the acting is so good and strong that even if the script \\"was\\" crap it wouldn't matter. the speacil effects are amazing-it's like your really there and the titanic is sinking right in frount of you, this just draws you right into the movie. And it's not just all speacil effects, even though there is lots in it. it is worth seeing the movie just for the love story, and then there's all the action at the end. and anyone out there who hates this movie-majority ruels! millions of people watched it and it won 11 awards-what does this tell you? can't admit it? it means its good! just cos some of you aren't into the love story, or watching long movies-it doesn't even seem that long when you watch it anyway. And another thing, it's really toucthing, when i was in the movies watching it at least 25 people where crying your eyes out-you don't cry like that over a crap movie that hasn't toutched or moved you in some way.
B0000035E7|5.0|Before the masses were blown away by the masterpiece \\"Nevermind\\" in 1991, Nirvana released its debut album \\"Bleach\\" sometime during 1989. <br /> <br />If you haven't heard this album yet, you totally should. <br />This is not for those casual \\"Nevermind\\" fans who worship only \\"Smells like teen spirit\\", this is for the true Nirvana fan that can appreciate real talent, even as raw as this album is. <br /> <br />This garage-band album has 13 notable songs: I give my personal opinion on every song. <br /> <br />BLEW: Cool opener, killer chorus and pretty average-but-good song. <br /> <br />FLOYD THE BARBER: Raw, lyrically creepy and musically somehow scary...but awesome, listen to it with the lights outand see if you get scared. <br /> <br />ABOUT A GIRL: Known by most of us because it was featured on the Unplugged. Great song. <br /> <br />SCHOOL: This short-worded song is one rocking ride!  <br /> <br />LOVE BUZZ: Another cool tune, I haven't heard the original version but this cover sounds pretty good. <br /> <br />PAPER CUTS: If Floyd The Barber was somewhat creepy, this is flat out scary...what an amazing depressive song. <br /> <br />NEGATIVE CREEPS: Fast rockin' song. <br /> <br />SCOFF: Cool drum intro and even though not a special song, it is awesome. <br /> <br />SWAP MEET: One of my favorites, all the way fantastic song. <br /> <br />MR. MOUSTACHE: Even better than Swap Meet, fast-paced song. <br /> <br />SIFTING: The longest song on the album, 5 minutes and something...a good example of a great song by the not-yet-famous Nirvana. <br /> <br />BIG CHEESE: Wow! This is one of the songs I thought I'd be skipping but I played it all the time.  <br /> <br />DOWNER: The perfect closer, my favorite song on the album...really fast and good lyrics...the chorus is BRILLIANT.
B00066J1RG|5.0|Not since Madonna's \\"Immaculate Collection\\" has such an impressive body of work been displayed in the world of pop music. Kylie has compiled an arsenal of hits from the late 80s up til today. All the big ones are here from \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" to \\"Shocked\\" to \\"Confide In Me\\" to \\"Put Yourself In My Place\\" to \\"Spinning Around\\" to \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" to \\"Chocolate\\"!!! Whew, I love it. There are also two, very high energy new tracks. The fantastic \\"I Believe In You\\" and the incredibe (and being overlooked) \\"Giving You Up\\". It is impossible not to dance to these tracks. If you like pop mucis at all, this album is a must!!!!!
B000683VI4|2.0|I am giving two stars instead of zero or one because I've always loved James Garner and he does an outstanding job here...comparable but better than Henry Fonda in \\"On Golden Pond.\\" Garner has more sex appeal, charisma and charm than most actors half his age and that's one of the chief problems with \\"The Notebook\\": no way, no how, does wimpy Ryan Gosling (with his blank, unexpressive face) ever grow up to become James Garner. <br /> <br />Any tears legitimately shed here (and I am not ashamed that I cried openly) are due to Mr. Garner and the luminous Gena Rowlands. There is a lot of sentimental corniness in the roles, but the two veteran performers rise above this with sheer talent. <br /> <br />The problem is that this is not merely an above average Lifetime TV movie about the tragedy of Alzheimer's...it's meant to be a love story reaching over half a century. In that, \\"The Notebook\\" is a soggy failure. The story of the young lovers is not moving or genuine at all, and Ryan Gosling is so flat and unconvincing that it's impossible to even feel that h is in love, or that the heroine is in love with him. Besides his awkward, stilted performance, there is a serious problem with his appearance -- it's supposed to be the 1940s, but Mr. Gosling has long shaggy \\"hippie\\" hair (and later a scruffy beard)...he is also dressed in a variety of cute clothing from J. Crew or The Gap...not remotely what any self respecting man would have worn at that time. (I am also astonished that a soldier during WWII would have been allowed to have shaggy, collar length hair.) <br /> <br />It's also a serious detriment to the film that Mr. Gosling looks NOTHING like James Garner...nor does he have the skill to even slightly emulate the older man's distinctive speech or body language. Towards the end, we see Garner looking at some old photo albums which show the real actor as a young man...this is quite disorienting. How did Ryan Gosling -- lanky, thin, blonde with a long face -- turn into James Garner? How did his hair go from blonde to dark brown? (Even more disconcerting and confusing is that fact that James Marsden, playing the \\"other man\\", looks much more like Garner than Gosling does.) <br /> <br />The film abounds with confusing elements, some of which are real whoppers. Gosling and heroine Allie (a radiantly beautiful Rachel McAdams) cavort on a beach with huge rocky outcroppings -- this is not remotely what the South Carolina/Georgia coastline looks like. (It was obviously filmed in California.) Gosling's character, Noah, buys a huge plantation and restores it himself...right down to quaint lighting fixtures and chi-chi wall coverings -- how does he do this, when he doesn't even have a job? Later we see the elderly Noah and Allie living in a nearly identical white mansion, also on a river...is it the same house? Was their plantation rennovated into a nursing home at some point? No answer or explanation is attempted. (It's also the poshest nursing home I have ever seen.) <br /> <br />At another point, elderly Noah and Allie are visited by their children, whom Allie no longer can recognize...it is apparently the present day, or very recently...therefore, about 50 years after WWII and probably more. Yet their children are clearly only in their early 30s. Did Noah and Allie marry in 1947 and then wait until the early 70s to have kids???? <br /> <br />So, \\"The Notebook\\" is some pretty seriously flawed hogwash. About what I expected from the author of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"A Walk to Remember\\". It's redeemed only by James Garner and Gena Rowlands, and Rachel McAdams (showing a lot of improvement and potential talent) performances, but sunk by poor writing, a maudlin plot, tears dishonestly earned by treacle, and a performance by Ryan Gosling that ranks with the worst I have ever watched on the big screen. <br /> <br />You can wait to watch this one when it shows up on cable.
0739301985|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this story! It is laugh-out-loud funny and something I think almost anyone can relate to. As much as we love Christmas, the commercialism is enough to send anyone packing for a cruise instead, which is what the Kranks plan to do. Mr. Krank is something of a scrooge, and it's hilarious to see him try to fend off all the Christmas-pushers.<br /><br />Dennis Boutsikaris does an awesome job reading the book (for the audio version). He plays each character well. You can just feel how fed up Luther Krank is by the tone of Boutsikaris' voice.<br /><br />Enjoy the book, and ... Merry Christmas! hahaha...
B000002N2P|5.0|I'll try to help whoever reads this... <br />This used to be my favorite Green Day album until I got \\"1,039/smoothed out slappy hours\\", anyway, this album is lyrically Green Day's best. Every song on this album has a dark, pessimistic meaning behind that happy punk-ish tune, every song contains a charge of negativity not seen in other Green Day album...don't take it so seriously, it's really fun to listen to especially when you feel angry, rejected and hateful because the lyrics pretty much identify with that. <br />Musically is also great,the song \\"86\\" is, in my opinion, THE BEST Green Day song ever...so, if you wanna get a good album, musically satisfying and lyrically brilliant, get \\"Insomniac\\" by Green Day. <br />I conclude my review.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This excruciatingly slow and dull film would have been enhanced if it had a decent screenplay.  (To show you how far out Hollywood is, this movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.)  The plot takes forever to emerge, and then it isn't worth the wait.  Deadpan Bill Murray, flirting with a girl half his age, seems to adlib many of his lines.  After, say, an hour, the incredible shallowness of all concerned becomes overwhelming. <br /> <br />Both of the leads complain of insomnia.  They could have been cured by watching this film.
0671015206|5.0|I'm not being melodramatic. This really is the best book I've ever read, in terms of personal enhancement. It was a gift to me. I looked at the title and thought \\"What a load of junk.\\" Probably some silly book on how to get rich right? No! <br /> <br />This book is so darn simple that it's truly a crime against humanity that the elementary lessons in it are not ever learned by most of us. Yeah, we've all heard that if you put away such-and-such for so many years you'll end up with a big bunch of money, but most people hear that and forget it right away. I know that I always did. This book basically takes that lesson and actually encourages the learning of it. <br /> <br />The premise of this book is that you don't need to make that much money to become very wealthy. It's a practical approach to accumulating a great net worth. When I read it I knew little about such things. Like most other adults, who have no real plan for their financial future, I had some credit card debt. After reading this book I began to shun it, and 4.5 years later I still do. I'm so much better off than almost all of my friends (and it's not because I make more money). I have actual savings (truly how many people in their 20's do? Surprisingly a small minority have real savings. Most are blowing their money on junk), a retirement fund, and no credit card debt. I also, because I don't habitually borrow money I don't have for crap I don't need, have ended up with more in the way of \\"toys\\" than my friends, so yes you can have your cake and eat it too. <br /> <br />But enough of that. If you're interested in a no-nonsense, basic but very useful approach to dealing with money, give this book a try. I'm not saying it's the best book ever written, and it doesn't tell you all you need to know, but having spoken with others, I know that for many people this book is an \\"eye opener\\".
B000001G8A|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Domingo and Neblett sing this opera at Covent Garden in mid 1977, so I was delighted to find the recording.  (I don't remember Sherill Milnes in the role of Rance, but maybe he wasn't so famous back then!)  This is Puccini's next-to-last work, and his spikiest opera, with more modern tonalities than the lush melodies of his earlier works.  Even \\"Turandot\\", his last opera, brought back some of his earlier style.  It is an opera that improves as it goes along, with some really great duets between Minnie and Johnson in the final scenes.<br /><br />  This production is excellently sung, with Domingo in wonderful young voice, and Milnes doing a superb job humanizing the evil sheriff.  The soprano role is vocally very rough on the artist--Leontyne Price came famously to grief singing it at the Met in the mid '60s.  Carol Neblett does a very credible job in this role.  Although her Italian diction isn't the best, she sings with real intensity and security.  Mehta may not be the most refined or elegant opera conductor, but he always gives a good show, and that's the case here.  But the real star of this production is Milnes.  This set belongs in any opera lover's collection.
B0002IU988|4.0|I heard the second single \\"Find the Real\\" on the radio and thought I'd buy the CD.  Tremonti's guitar work is reason enough to buy this disc.  I was stunned by the title track.  Most of the songs have excellent solos and/or riffs that make novice players like myself drool.  There are a couple of potential big hits in here...\\"In Loving Memory\\" will surely make the band rich if they are smart with it (hopefully they will have enough class not to use Tremonti's personal life as a marketing tool, but I doubt it)...also \\"Down to My Last\\" has single potential.  \\"Burn it Down\\" and \\"Broken Wings\\" may not make it on the radio, but I could listen to those songs over and over.  Myles Kennedy's vocals are a bit of an improvement over Stapp's, but I think his style is still way over the top.  Since when did it become cool for guys to moan and breathe into the microphone like sissies after every lyric?  Some songs seem scattered and broken, but the more you listen, the more it pieces together.  This album should appeal to a wide audience.  The metalheads can find a couple of badass tracks such as \\"Metalingus\\", \\"Find the Real\\", and \\"Watch Your Words\\".  Those of you [...] \\"Stapp-Lovers\\" will find a couple of cheesy arena-rock ballads in the mix, and those who just like to hear great guitar work and powerful music will find what they're looking for, also.  The final track, \\"The End is Here\\", is very similar to Creed's second effort on the Scream 3 soundtrack, \\"Is this the End?\\", only with some Mannheim Steamroller at the end...ends up being a very good song, by the way.  In conclusion, although this is just Creed with better guitar-work, better drums, and a new singer that can actually hold a guitar like he's done it before, it's still worth the buy and 4 stars.
B000084T18|2.0|50 Cent was, is and never will be the new 2pac. This album is one of the most overrated albums ever. In da club is the only decent track. People if u want some real rap go buy any 2pac album especially ALL EYEZ ON ME

B000002UDG|4.0|There are quite a few compliation CDs out there of Paul McCartney's post-Beatles work. Of them all, \\"All the Best\\" comes closest to the goal of giving the consumer what they want while still leaving them wanting something more. Almost all of McCartney's major American hits are here, from the early 1970s to the middle 1980s. The tunes range from Beatles-style productions like \\"Another Day\\" and \\"Uncle Albert\\" to rockers like \\"Junior's Farm\\" and \\"Band on the Run\\" to then-trendy AM singles \\"Listen to What the Man Said\\" and \\"Silly Love Songs\\" to game attempts at duets. McCartney is a multi-instrumentalist as well as a versatile composer and most of these tunes are catchy whether you want to fall under their spell or not. It's easy to write off McCartney as a lightweight, but anyone who can compose a melody you'll remember long after hearing it is doing something right! <br /> <br />This isn't the complete McCartney, however, nor should it be. It's a sampler of his career, not a box set. It ignores many of his British hits, fails to include \\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" and doesn't touch his most recent material, which many fans view as a return to form for him. Buy it expecting only the greatest hits, and you'll be satisfied. Buy it hoping it will include everything from \\"Teddy Boy\\" to \\"Biker Like an Icon\\" and you will walk away extremely disappointed.  <br /> <br />Personally, I'd recommend picking up one of McCartney's live DVDs if you aren't wedded to the idea of having the original studio recordings. Love him or hate him, the man's an amazing live performer.
0753506483|4.0|Lots of interesting stories about his ventures. However it is defenitely about him promoting himself just like Donald Trump. These are Ego Maniacs and they both love the limelight. Amazing though how he has ventured in to so many arenas. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Ah yes, the U2 album early review syndrome. That consists of people hearing U2's newest album just once, immediately forming an opinion, and posting it. I would have thought that by now everyone would have realized U2 albums aren't the most easily accessible. It takes repeated listens to uncover all of the layers, and truly discover what the album is all about. That's both good and bad, but in the end, a very good thing. It keeps the album from becoming old, which is rare in music these days. On the downside, it also makes for a lot of negative reviews at first. I think true U2 fans will agree that it's worth suffering through some negative reviews for an album that will be referred to as a classic 10 years from now. <br /> <br />It's sad that so many people have clearly stated that they'd only heard the album once before deciding it was \\"trash\\". Yet those same people also say that Vertigo is the one good song on the album. Could that be because they've heard the song many times already, and have had a chance to explore it? It sure seems like it. I hope at some point, everyone gives the full album that chance, as I'm confident many opinions will change. <br /> <br />I am the proud owner of both the normal version of the album as well as the collectors edition, but I was fortunate to hear the album before its release. As a result, I've listened to the complete album upwards of 40 times. Funny enough, I'm still uncovering sounds and lyric meanings. At first listen, it's easy to not pick up much depth to How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb (HTDAAB). However, after listening for a while, it becomes obvious that not only is this a very deep album both in meaning and in music, but one of U2's best. That's a very strong statement, especially for a band over 25 years into their career, but it's entirely true. The fact that sticks in my mind the most is that there is not one track I don't truly enjoy hearing. I have yet to skip a track, and my \\"favorite\\" changes with nearly every listen. <br /> <br />I was one of the people that found U2's previous album, All That You Can't Leave Behind (ATYCLB), a little weak, despite the incredible tour that surrounded it. I was worried about Bono's voice, and that the band as a whole might have lost their spark to create music. Hearing HTDAAB quickly calmed my fears, to say the least. HTDAAB is better than ATYCLB by leaps and bounds in every way. Bono has found his voice again, every song has a great deal of depth and strength, and the whole band seems excited about creating and playing music again. Without question, HTDAAB features all four members in their top form. Bono's voice has more strength and clarity than it has in many years, while retaining all of its emotiveness. In fact, Bono is sounding even better live recently than he does on the album, which is very encouraging news for the upcoming tour. Edge finally realized just how gifted of a guitar player he is, and he's in full force. Adam's bass has never been more prominent and detailed throughout an entire album, and it truly drives the album. Larry's drumming is more intricate than ever, and really defines the structure for each song. <br /> <br />In closing, I can't help but repeat how great and strong of an album HTDAAB truly is. While I still rank Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby as U2's greatest, HTDAAB contains the most consistently strong song lineup of any album they've put out. This may not be their most innovative album, and it is U2 being U2, but I don't think I would have wanted anything else out of HTDAAB. As one reviewer said, HTDAAB has one leg in the past, and one in the future. I couldn't agree more. <br /> <br />If you're not a fan of U2 to begin with, then I wouldn't expect you to like HTDAAB. Not liking U2 or HTDAAB is fine, but not giving them a chance, or needlessly bashing them is not. HTDAAB will go on to be yet another album with \\"classic\\" status in U2's vast archive. Please don't immediately brush the album off after just one listen; it's truly an amazing and very emotionally moving piece of music. With that said, U2 is the best live band around, and that truly is the environment in which their songs come alive and their magic is exposed. March 1st can't come soon enough! Good thing we have such a brilliant album to tide us over.
1402511787|5.0|My partner gave up on this one after listening to 2 tapes, but DON'T follow  his lead.  This is a great novel, and very well read too.  I'm not an intellectual, so I can't give you any erudite interpretations, but if you like a good story that is also a wee bit thought provoking and even a bit confusing (at the end), listen to this.  I also found it funny in a sly subtle sort of way.  I'm sure it should have won the Booker prize.  To be honest, I'd never heard of this guy, but after finishing, I went and bought the book and another unabridged audio version to give as gifts.  Tip:  if you're male and you don't like Jane Austen, Barbara Pym, etc. start on tape 5 or so...or if you're reading the book, section 2.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|alright.  first of all, i heard this band on vh1 and i liked its hit song \\"Take Me Out\\".  I liked the song so much that I bought the album...A huge deception in many ways.  First, it is extremely short, the songs are mostly very short.  Second, \\"Take Me Out\\" is actually the only good song that they have that i can think of.  Third, if you thought these guys were like \\"the Strokes\\" or that kind of band, you were wrong.  These guys use too much retro 80's, too much dance, and less rock.  This is not rock, its retro80s/dance/rock, but its not rock.   <br /> <br />However, I did like \\"Jaqueline\\" because it is perhaps the most 'rocklike' song.  It's extremely cool; its melodic, the guitars are simply catchy, the song is my favorite.  The other that i like that i can think of is \\"Cheating on you\\" which is rocklike, and its extremely catchy.  YOull like it if you like the strokes plus you like dance music, like retro80s dance, pop kind of thing.  And \\"michael\\"???? Thats the kind of song that youre like \\"ive wasted my money on this???\\"  if youre a guy and you like guys, youll like \\"micheal\\", if not, you'll be like wtf?? like i was.   <br /> <br />Finally, I have respect for Scottish bands, like Travis et al, but this one is an exception.  Their hairdos are weird, their clothings are weird, their music is weird.  its just not rock, its too much retro.   <br /> <br />All i can say, is that this is very short, it is too much retro, and not much rock.  Yes some songs are ok, but others are like \\"what the...is this??\\" Believe me, strokes fans, you wont be satisfied with this.  Download 'take me out' and that's it.
B00008WT49|3.0|One of the requirements of SACD releases, as set forth by Sony and Phillips, is that there be at least an SACD (DSD) stereo layer.  The surround DSD and hybrid Red Book PCM CD compatible layers are optional.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, the stereo DSD layer on this release was taken from the Red Book 16/44.1 PCM master used to make the CD layer.  So Blue Note skirted a basic requirement of the format they were releasing on by deceptively scamming consumers into thinking they were getting a true SACD.  As far as anyone knows, however, the surround SACD layer was taken directly from the 2 inch multitrack and sampled to DSD, then remixed and mastered to the SACD surround layer.  I haven't heard anything to the contrary.  As it stands right now, I agree with Fremer that Blue Note should simply apologize, pull the current release, rerelease a proper SACD, and give past purchasers a free exchange.  I listened to the surround layer at my parents house in Oregon and was pleased at the music and sound quality.  I do think it is overall a bit emotionally monotonal and placid though, as the recent SNL (or was it Mad TV) spoof parodied.  But I think people who buy it are looking for that.  Still enjoyable.<br /><br />Let me clear up some of the misconceptions floating around:<br /><br />Keep your universal DVD player set up internally for 5.1 channel with all channels on at fixed volume (usually max output), set to large, and your reciever/preamps on Surround Direct Analog with no digital conversion...then pray that you have a DVD player and reciever that doesn't do anything else funky.  All of the older Denon universal units really messed with the sound.  If you're still not getting good bass, then you need full range speakers.  Never ever have speakers turned off or set to small in your DVD player when listening to SACD's.  In fact, you shouldn't even do this with stereo CDs, since you'll mess up the dynamic range that the outputs are working at.<br /><br />Most universal players use the original Sony DSD chip, which has a little port that connects to the DAC.  Contrary to popular belief, SACD is not converted to DVD-Audio (PCM as opposed to the PWM of DSD) when it goes into that little port.  That just sends the analog signal to the filter stage to lop off the high frequency noise.  The only conversion that will ever occur is if you try and do bass management, which will kick the Sony converter chip into what's called Wide-DSD...a euphamism for a form of very high frequency PCM, also called Narrow PCM.  It's still PCM, it's just that Sony doesn't like to call it that.  So, keep everything On, Large, and Fixed in the player and Pure Analog Direct after it gets out and you'll probably be fine.  Do volume changes in the reciever in the analog domain.<br /><br />I also wouldn't trust the new players that convert everything to SACD internally to do bass management.  It's another form of Wide-DSD.  Why?  Because you can't do computations with a 1-Bit format.  You can't mix in SACD or produce in that format until you either convert it to analog or PCM.  You can only record/master live to each descrete 1-Bit DSD channel, then you're stuck with it as is.  All the SACD recording consoles are actually this psuedo-DVD-Audio format internally, though they likely sound quite good.  To get true DSD through and through you either record/produce to analog tape, or you mix live, which is probably why Telarc likes the format so much.<br /><br />PCM has good points and bad.  PWM has good points and bad, too.  They're both very low noise, but PCM tends to sound a bit artificial and lacking in that organic body of analog.  PWM is hella organic and analog-like (probably due to its psuedo-analog 1-bit nature), but embeds subtle quantization noise within the signal permanently, often leaving it sounding not quite as transparent and Oh-My-God-clear and pristine as DVD-Audio at 192khz.  Some engineers claim that the high frequencies are inferior in transient response to even normal Red Book CD, but transients are so difficult to measure, Red Book so rife with other problems, and DSD does so well in all the other departments (including other characteristics of its highs) that I find it to be a non-issue.  At least you get SACD on all the channels in 5.1, definitely as good or better than 24/96.  The last thing you want is conversion back and forth between the two formats internally; then you get the worst of both worlds.  Remember that DSD was invented for archival purposes to permanently store the Columbia Records inventory.  The archival format's actually twice the bitrate of consumer SACD, so it likely sounds as lovely as is claimed.CD, but transients are so difficult to measure, Red Book so rife with other problems, and DSD does so well in all the other departments (including other characteristics of its highs) that I find it to be a non-issue.

B00005JNEI|5.0|\\"Pack of Lies\\", \\" total B#$%...t\\", That comes off sounding very brainwashed. George Bush played the starring role in this film. In my opinion, George Bush is Cinderella and this movie is the \\"golden slipper.\\" <br /> <br />Don't just watch this movie. Also see \\"Fog of War\\" with Robert S McNamarra, see \\"Bush's Brain\\", read history, view the timeline - It all fits perfectly. I'll tell you what makes Moore such a good story teller: Reality! Its all documented and available. Pull your heads out of the sand and look it up. To those of you who said: \\"Wake Up, America.\\" - I echo 1000 times. <br /> <br />We have been duped again.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|I have two thoughts on Collateral, 1) it's a complete hoax of a psychological thriller or predictably 2) it's a stunning psychological thriller. I cant make up my mind, so I went for a decent 4 stars instead of the 5 I would prefer to give.<br /><br />There are some rather ordinary clich&eacute;s throughout the film, such as Cruise's smooth grey suit and shades, the plot `twist' is predictable and horribly clich&eacute;d, the final outcome in the film is much the same. But, I just adored watching the relationship between Vincent (Cruise) and the taxi driver Max (Foxx), truly enthralling. The borders a man has before his action appears inhumane...and Max's borders are pushed to the extreme driving the soave hitman to his next victims. You feel Max knows he's doing wrong, he tries to take action but can't. The borders between humane and inhumane seem non-existent in Vincent, yet he shows he has feelings, emotions, he shows he is a moral human being.<br /><br />Collateral is a slick, arty action/psychological thriller full of some great scenes. But I just felt a missed opportunity rising towards the end, a better ending would put this film miles ahead.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|My wife and I watched Everwood religiously during its first and second seasons. Season One was great. We loved the characters, the writing, the dramatic elements, the comedy, the thought-provoking narration. Unfortunately, we both feel the show began to decline in Season Two, which included more sex and drugs, and also over-did some themes (Amy and Colin issues, etc.). We were especially offended by the teen sex. Season Three now appears to be descending further into a mere teen soap opera. Disappointing.     I would highly recommend Season One, except you will probably get hooked and want to watch the following seasons, which I am unable to recommend.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Many of these reviews blast purists and tell them to suck it up and get with the times.  Personally, I am a purist.  I want Lucas to release the ORIGINAL on dvd.     I understand how this position may be difficult for a younger generation to understand.  Let me paint a parallel to which most people will be able to relate.  Lets say, theoretically, that in 20-30 years the Tolkien estate comes under new management.  Peter Jackson obtains the rights to The Hobbit and makes a new movie.  He casts Brad Pitt as Gandalf and proceeds to dub over Sir Ian McKellen's face in the original trilogy just to make the movies \\"mesh\\" more efficiently.  While he's at it he makes a few more changes that either a minority of people want or that he'd been wanting to do for years.  He makes all the Gondorians African American and the Rohirrim Native American because a few people have complained that the trilogy was racist.  Just for fun he places a repeating ballista on the top of each Oliphaunt and adds an army of dwarfs to the Battle of Pelennor Fields. He also touches up the scenery by adding flying dragons to the background or expanding some of the battle scenes with fighting wizards or other such junk.  The finale is altered to include a MiddleEarth wide song/dance/celebration with Hobbits doing ballet and Elves rapping.  All of these effects are done using state-or-the-art tech that contrasts harshly with the film quality of today.  Jackson then refuses to release the original LOTR on the video system that replaces dvd because the new one is \\"better\\".  You also have to listen to a new generation talking about how dated the original LOTR are and saying that Jackson is justified in mangling them.  If you are a fan of LOTR and this scenario does not bother you, then you truly have my sympathy.       Returning to reality: I am going to hold on to my VHS versions of the original Star Wars Trilogy and hope they last until Lucas dies and someone else releases the original on dvd.
B00007BHOE|5.0|OMFG!!! This dvd is so amazing! It blows your mind in every possible way! I could watch every part of this dvd over and over and over again a thousand times...oh wait...I have, and still am! This dvd is just...awww! I love it so much. I recommend that every maggot out there go out and buy a copy for themselves...and a couple more copies for your friends and even to get someone new into the slipknot world.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I, Robot despite having a pathetic title was surprisingly good. I was fully expecting a dribbling generic Hollywood piece of crap, but it had a deep underlying thought, something rare these days. That of when does machine end, and humanity start, how far can we rely on machine. Never the machine forever as Soundgarden would say (if you haven't listened to Soundgarden's Down On The Upside, you will have no clue what I'm talking about).<br /><br />Will Smith, was well, himself...no suprises then. His distinct lack of actual acting talent is excused for being a trendy, `old school' character that still has an old CD player (a modern one by todays standards) in the year god knows, if it tells you I cant remember, probably 2020-ish. Smiths name is Del Spooner, who works in homicide. For all his life he has a rather unpopular view on the spectacular robots, one day they will be mans downfall. His case is strengthened somewhat when the leading scientist for the robot manufacturer is killed, but the case becomes more serious than first imagined.<br /><br />Being an action film in the year 2004, it has plenty of genuinely thrilling moments full of glorious special effects. But the deeper thinking involved boosts this film considerably, from maybe 2.5 to a 3.5, possibly higher. Well worth a watch, don't expect wonders but more your typical action thriller, but better thought out.
B0002Y69NG|3.0|For one person who loved all three person, I am suitably annoyed that all the extras are only coming out under this set. What about those of use who bought the 3 movies, Matrix Revisited plus the Animatrix on DVDs? <br /> <br />That said, I'll probably get it for the philosophical commentary tracks when it does come out. Although the Wackowskis' refusal to talk about the films themselves is reaching a new level of annoying-ness. <br /> <br />$60 for all the films and plenty of extras to keep you glued to your chairs this Christmas so you don't have to talk to your families IS a good deal... if you haven't already got the DVDs.  <br /> <br />As far as the extras, these films did break new grounds in cinematic special effects and computer conceptual designs. A true film guru should get this set for those little featurettes alone. If however you don't like the films or own the films already, or you don't watch the extras on the DVDs, this would be a waste of your hard earned cash.
B0001Z52S4|1.0|First off, I wanted to see this when it was in theaters, but I never got around to it. I bought this movie from Hollywood Video a few weeks ago and I was very disappointed.  this movie was 1.highly unbelievable and 2.incredibly violent.      It took too long to get to the climax.  I saw a different ending from the one in the theaters, but i heard about what happened in that one.  All I want to say is that I'm glad I didn't b/c that is too violent, and I am sure I would have been offended to the utmost.    Save your money.  This tripe should have never made it.
B0006284JQ|1.0|As primarily a jazz-pop musician I occasionally take a listen (albeit quite brief)to some of the top forty songs that are passing, at least commercially, for \\"music\\" these days. I took such a listen to this recent Britney Spears album. All I can say is the following:  <br /> <br />This girl quite obviously \\"sings\\" only via the aid of digital effects, electronic mixing, layers of tracking, and blaring backup music to obscure her actual lack of vocal acumen. Indeed, while listening I had to ask myself: \\"Is there anyone singing on these records?\\" All I heard was a high-pitched, nebulous whine interspersed with grunts and groans which combined made the entire cacaphony of noise sound somewhat like a bizarre cross between a large farm animal suffering from constipation and an infant crying for her baby bottle. No pitch, no key modulation, repetitive tempos, inane and often vulgar lyrics (when they were distinguishable, which wasn't too often), and no musicality whatsoever. Is this the nadir to which popular music has deteriorated? If so, it's a shame Tiny Tim has passed on....he would be able to make a grand comeback in today's pop music environment. He doubtless had a better voice than Britney Spears. But then, so do Alvin and the Chipmunks, Lurch, and Moe, Larry and Curly. <br /> <br />Based upon what I have come to know of this Britteny Spears' character, I think it is safe to assume that come her next album Britney will appear on the cover totally nude and the disc inside the cover will be completely blank. Based on the apparent menial mentalities of her hordes of worshippers, they won't notice a thing has changed, and I'm just as sure the album will sell just as well as all of her previous musical masterpieces. Proof that in today's popular music industry a  \\"popular singer\\" no longer needs a voice to become a \\"singing sensation,\\" an idol of millions---all she needs is the attire of a French whore, the stage gyrations of a porn star in heat, and the backing of a multimillion dollar marketing machine. When I was a kid, I remember my parents thinking the Beatles were juvenile-acting, silly-looking, and musically amatuerish and mostly a product of mass media promotion. As years went by I began to see their point. Yet, compared with Britney Spears, John, Paul, George, and Ringo looked, played, and sounded like Igor Stravinsky, Arthur Fiedler, Leopold Stokowski, and Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br />From Janet Jackson's simulating sexual acts and exposing her breasts on stage to Britney's lip-synching while strip-teasing on stage, the state of American pop music has become a showplace for coarseness, vulgarity, tastelessness, and, worst of all, a dearth of any sounds remmotely resembling genuine music. And to think millions of our children are growing up thinking that overexposed, oversexed, untalented cartoons are models of emulation. Young kids today who like music are already growing up with the notion to be---- not a pianist, guitarist, or drummer----- but rather the mindless, unmusical dote who operates the electronic instrument machines. Let's see, we have singers who don't sing, musicians who don't play musical instruments, and fashion plate pop perfomers who wear virtually no clothes. I think something is terribly wrong here, don't you?    <br /> <br />Ahh, the sweet music of the spheres....where art thou gone? <br /> <br />I think I'll go back to my Ella Fitgerald, Mel Torme, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Frank Sinatra albums. Maybe in another year or two I'll once again venture out into the fabricated world of pop music and take a listen at another Top Forty singer's vocal creations, but I doubt it.
6303921248|5.0|I can't imagine any other actress for Elizabeth Bennett than Jennifer Ehle.  She is so lovely in this film and incredibly fun to watch.  I actually think Colin Firth outshines Laurence Olivier as Mr. Darcy.  Olivier lacked the dimensional intensity for the Darcy character which is how readers see him in Jane Austen's novel.  Firth plays him to absolute perfection so I would recommend this version over the black and white one any day.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Barf!!!!!!!! Puke!!!!! Gag!!!!! Belch!!!! <br /> <br />Thanks for allowing me to share these sentiments with you.
6302759110|5.0|This was the first Gary Oldman film I ever saw and it made me an instant fan.  Oldman's version of Count Dracula isn't the Halloween-theatrical type which audiences are used to seeing.  Instead, he's passionate, sexy, dimensional, and you actually want him to get the girl in the film.  Of course this film has a great deal of blood and gore but it's Dracula so it's to be expected.  The costumes and sets are so beautiful creating a vision of Gothic drama.  If you're a fan of vampire films, as I am, watch this incredible version which shouldn't be missed.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Now you don't have to keep changing CD's to hear all your favorite Shania Twain songs! Plus three great new songs!
B00004WGAI|5.0|This is the satisfying romance I have long searched for.  Clarke and Dalton are simply flawless together in this timeless story.  There are so many moments that make me giddy because they are so romantic and sexy.  For example, in one scene Dalton as Mr. Rochester is holding Clarke as Jane Eyre in his arms and he kisses her hair repeatedly.  This isn't a scene with nudity but to me it's sexy in a subtle way.  I repeat this moment over and over again when I'm watching it alone.  Buy this film because it should be part of the video library to a lover of romantic films.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I bought this album the day came out (april 23rd 2003) and up to now I listen this cd every day, It has a lot of punch, I think this album is the most mature effort from her, in this, she shows us a new side, she talks about things that never wrote in other albums like the story of her parents (mother and father) and I like the way she combines sarcasm with a material world we are living (american life, hollywood), and she recognizes the misteps she has had all over the years but I think in a more complete way. In my opinion, this is one of the best albums from Madonna ever of course together with Ray of light. Buy this cd, give it a chance you won't regret it! By the way, I went to her last tour (Re-Invention Tour) and it was so awesome, she still rocks and she demonstrated once again why she is still the Queen of Pop!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye's beats are hot.  He's made jay-z's beats.  Heart of the city.  And his lines are hot.  The skits are good for a laugh.  The final track \\"Last Call,\\" tells us how Kanye got to where he is now.
B0002DB52M|5.0|What a movie! Just bought it on DVD after having downloaded it and watched it on my PC a couple of times (Something I very often do before buying music or films, if it's bad, I won't buy it, if it's really good; I will) I love this movie, the story is brilliant, and the TV-theatre/theatre way it was shot helps the story, if you see something, it means something. The movie might be taken different in the USA, than in Denmark, or better: Scandinavia. It's a view from Denmark and Scandinavia of the USA that you see here, not an american view, not a european view, but a danish/scandinavian view of the USA. Lars von Trier offers the way the USA looks from over in Denmark and Scandinavia, something many americans might oppose, but that's the way people in Scandinavia see the USA through TV, books, films, and media. If it was vice versa scandinavians might've been puzzled or angry too, only difference is that 1/6 of the content in a daily newspaper in the US isn't about scandinavian afairs, and 80% of what's on TV isn't made in Scandinavia. But anyways, I think this movie should enjoyable for everyone above 15 years of age who are looking for a thoughtful, expressive, and yet very straight forward movie. I love this movie!
B0006FO9J2|5.0|I just watched this 2 dvd set and it is amazing.  The documentary was lovingly prepared and filled with original interviews through much of the undocumented early days of the band.  I had no idea that there were that many early members of the band.  It is a valuable piece of history concerning the early days of the NWOBHM when metal was first starting to take its formal image and reputation.  I was amazed at all the preformances particularly Dianno's club preformances on disc 2. Im prefer him as the better club singer while dickenson was the better stadium singer.  The \\"20th century box\\" documentary is totally goofy! they spent too much time interviewing goofy fans who were making cardboard guitars to play air guitar. Now I understand Judas Priest's video \\"livin after midnight\\" better because there are some loosers dancing around with cardboard guitars there too.  This is a great dvd and worth getting even if you are just a heavy metal fan in general.  I cant stop laughing at all the Spinal Tap outfits and behaviour that are sprinkled through the set. great set of a great band. Up the Irons!
B000062YAZ|5.0|Best Slayer album ever made, I can't even imagine what metal would be like with out Reign In Blood. From Angel of Death I love this cd, here's a list of what I rate the songs.<br /><br />1. Angel of Death 5/5, Great intro for the cd<br /><br />2. Piece By Piece 5/5, Awsome riff here<br /><br />3. Necrophobic 3/5, Awsome yet to short<br /><br />4. Altar of Sacrifice 5/5, Love the lyrics and drum/guitar intro<br /><br />5. Jesus Saves 4/5, Very fast vocals yet a lil to fast<br /><br />6. Criminally Insane 4/5, Like but don't like the drum opening<br /><br />7. Reborn 4/5, Once again awsome song but vocals lil to fast<br /><br />8. Epidemic 5/5, Love this drum intro<br /><br />9. Postmortem 5/5, My favorite song next to Raining Blood<br /><br />10. Raining Blood 6/5, My favoritist Slayer song (see why below)<br /><br />11. Aggresive Perfector 4/5, Good bonus song, awsome scream.<br /><br />12. Criminally Insane (Remix) 5/5, Awsome sound effects<br /><br />Why I like Raining Blood so much. It has the greatest intro, I don't know why they didn't have it as the opening track but, I can also see how it works as a last track. I just love this song so much, the guitars, the bass, the lyrics, the vocals, the drums, this one song makes the whole cd worth your money.
B00003CXCT|5.0|No, these are not \\"the originals,\\" but honestly, I am not a purist.  I love it all, and the more Star Wars the better for me.   <br /> <br />This DVD collection is absolutley amazing.  In comparing the original in-theatre teaser trailers (included on the special features disk and look awful - scratches, pops and all) to the beautiful images in the films, I can only imagine how painstaking it must have been to clean these classics up frame by frame. <br /> <br />The results are breathtaking, and the sound is incredible.  Not to mention that having them on DVD is just so convenient - no fast forward or rewind issues, etc. <br /> <br />There are also several \\"easter eggs\\" or hidden features on the bonus disk - most notibly the hidden \\"gag reel\\" or outakes from the films.  A quick search online will give you the instructions for accessing them. <br /> <br />Highly recommended - a must have for any fan.
B0006FO9J2|5.0|It's about time Paul Di'anno gets some recognition.  I got into Maiden about 1982 (when Bruce came aboard) but I always thought Paul had something great about him.  I'm not saying he was a better singer than Bruce but I still really dug the first 2 albums best.  They had attitude!  I recommend this for younger fans who are only familar with the Bruce Dickinson era Maiden.
B00025ETIW|3.0|After hearing the song I'm Not Okay (I Promise) by this band, I was compelled to check out the CD. The song just rocked, and I was hoping for more of the same. To be honest, I was rather disappointed. <br /> <br />I don't know if it was my stereo, or if my copy of the CD is no good, but half the time you can't hear what the singer is saying. I've looked at the lyrics, and they're great, but you just can't hear the words. I tried turning it up and it just made it worse. Perhaps there's something wrong with my CD, but it's given me a bad impression of the band itself. The music is good, but the lyrics are just impossible which takes away from it. <br /> <br />So, if only one song on the CD has lyrics you can hear and understand, it's really not worth the buy. If you can get it to work, though, by all means, buy it.
B0002Y4T92|3.0|I do like this DVD.  The sound quality is very good as is the overall production.  But I've heard the full concert, which is over 10 hours, and these discs squeeze out only 3 1/2 hours of it.  And don't tell me they couldn't fit on any more - the Led Zeppelin 2DVD set has 5 1/2 hours of music!  So what do we miss here? - well, Clapton starts with 4 or 5 Robert Johnson songs (not surprising, given his latest album) but the DVD has just one.  ZZ Top give a great closing one hour set, but we get just 2 songs here (good ones though) etc etc.  Highlights of the DVD include: Eric playing in shorts and sandals, JJ Cale with Eric (superb), Buddy Guy (all too little), Hubert Sumlin, BB King, ZZ Top - and John Mayer turns out some very nice blues licks.  I would have liked to see much more of these artists - which space and taste justified - but the proceeds to charity would have remained the same so we get de minimus. <br />
B00005QXDD|4.0|I kind of hope the members of Tenacious D aren't looking into a series music career. Their comedy is great, but their music is rather lacking. Nevertheless, buy this CD for a hearty good laugh. Who wouldn't laugh at the power to kill a yak from 200 yards away with mind bullets? I know I can't help but laugh at that. <br /> <br />Most of the songs on this CD are just flat out zany and amusing; with only a few that sound like they were trying to be serious (they fail at this miserably). They've got the humor bit down, but as for music, eh, they might want to just stick to the humor. Great CD though.
B0002XVSRE|2.0|One listen of the first 1-20 seconds of \\"Fast Cars\\" lets you know clearly why it's a b-side.<br /><br />It is not one of U2's best songs, filler if anything... the same droning chorus over and over: not a song you'll look forward to and easily the least desirable song on the entire CD hands down.<br /><br />If I didn't know better (which I don't) I'd say SD is sitting on a load of these and wants to try to sell them at an outragious markup.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has quite possibly done it again. The songs on this CD vent out the frustrations of many people about America, politics, and other every day things that just tick you off. Most of the CD seems rather anti-current American policy, and I can't say I blame them at all. In fact, I share many of their views. <br /> <br />Getting away from what it all `means' and junk like that, it just sounds good. They really rock it out on the guitar and the drums, and it all has a beat you just want to bang your head to. <br /> <br />The only songs on this CD I don't really like are Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, and She's a Rebel. The only reason I don't like Jesus of Suburbia is because it's so friggin long. I suppose it being divided into 4 or 5 sections makes it more like 4 or 5 songs, but when you look at your stereo system and see that the same song has been playing for 7 minutes, people like me just get annoyed. St. Jimmy is a personal problem on my part, and She's a Rebel just has stupid lyrics. But the rest of the songs are great, and it makes the CD well worth any money you might shell out for it.
B00068IOWC|5.0|Reminds me a bit of the last release, but i feel more solid. The songs are deep and full of emotion. If you like Vertigo and are expecting this speed and energy throughout... don't get this. The rest of the tracks save the first one (Vertigo) are very different. Bono's voice is a shade raspier than in the past... but the guy has been around the block: his song writing and soul are as good and better than ever however.<br /><br />I know everyone expects \\"With or without you\\", \\"One\\", and \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\"... this band has matured and so has their music. For what it's worth as a long time fan... I consider this their best yet.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I am a huge zombie movie fan. I think I've seen them all, and you'd think that, being a fan, I would be horribly offended by someone making a parody of this great genre of films. <br /> <br />Heck no, bring it on! <br /> <br />After seeing Shaun of the Dead, I was surprised that I could stop myself from laughing. The jokes were dead on, they made fun of every aspect of a typical zombie movie, and they did it so well. Even when you see the main character making heart breaking decisions concerning loved ones and a round of bullets he may/may not unload into their chest, you still just have to laugh at how horrible it all is. The way the camera moves, too, is like a horror film, which gets really amusing when they keep dramatically moving the camera to non-threatening objects/people/actions. Another amusing point is how long it takes for Shaun to realize that there's a zombie problem. Even endless TV shows talking about the problem doesn't seem to clue him in, and he goes about daily life like nothing happened. <br /> <br />To reveal more would kill the plot, and I can't very well do that to you. If you missed the movie in theatres, I suggest buying it the second it comes out on DVD and slapping this puppy into your DVD player for a nice, hearty laugh. You won't regret it. <br /> <br />Hey, if George Romero said it was good, it has to be, right?
B00008EY7H|5.0|My obsession with cirque just after Allegria left Sydney. Live performances are obviously best but this is as close as you can get.  Thrilling performances, great music plus all the behind the scenes stuff make this a must have DVD!!!!!
0061015725|3.0|This sci-fi thriller follows a computer programmer as he confronts a terrifying organism which his company unwittingly created when experimenting with nano-technology and micro-biology.  This first person narrative is somewhat boring in that the main character (the narrator) is not at all an intriguing personality.  He seems cold; he does not express the emotions warranted of man in his situations and thus does not evoke the corresponding emotions in the reader.   <br /> <br />As usual with Crichton there were also several explanatory gaps in the science behind the story.  When Crichton runs into a difficult spot regarding the scientific particulars he tends to rush the narrative past that point or else he simply ignores it.  Thus the reader remains unsatisfied for the remainder of the story and feels somewhat cheated for the sake of simplicity.  A particularly large gap in this story comes when the organisms interact with certain characters.  This event is central to the plot, but Crichton never attempts to offer even a theoretical explanation of how or why this complicated and unlikely event takes place.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the story moves along a fair pace throughout most of the novel, and Crichton's style, while not remarkable, makes for an entertaining read with enough suspense and intrigue to get you through a cross-country flight.  In comparison with Crichton's other novels which I have read this ranks near the bottom, better than Airframe but not as good as Timeline, Sphere, Andromeda Strain, or Jurassic Park. I give it a C.  <br />
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|If you're a fan of Shania, then this c.d. is a MUST HAVE!  ONE album with ALL of her best hits!  It even includes three new songs which are great, including the awesome new duet with Billy Curringtion, \\"Party for Two.\\" \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" takes you back to Shania's country side.  Country, Pop, whatever you prefer, this is THE c.d. to have for any Shania fan!
B0002F6BRE|1.0|My wife and I rented this film last week.  It made me feel more disgusted than the time I rented a film and didn't have time to watch it.  This move is really terrible.  I love Will Ferrel's comeday, but this moview does not use any of it.  Terrible, terrible, terrible movie.
B0001I561Y|5.0|Aladdin has never looked better.  This special edition DVD has all kinds of fun extras, deleted songs and scenes, games, and two hours worth of behind the scenes footage.  This boxed set not only comes with the platinum edition of Aladdin, but a little story book, and some of the original character sketches. <br /> <br />Most of the deleted songs and scenes are from the first story bored of the movie. This was when Aladdin was much younger, and had a mother.  \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" has become one of my favorite songs.  There are two games to play and few cute animated extras for the kids and those who are kids at heart, like me.  There are also interviews with almost every one that had a hand in the movie, and many more little extras that make this one of the best special edition Disney movies so far. <br /> <br />The little book is done with full color pictures and photos.  There are three chapters, a forward, and a storybook.  The book contains more behind the scenes facts and interviews. My favorite part though is the storybook of Aladdin with full color pictures. <br /> <br />The best part for me though was the character sketches.  Being an artist my self I love learning new techniques and looking at other professionals art work.  There is a sketch of each of the main characters that is signed by the main artist.  The sketches are not directly from the movie but how each of the artists portrayed their character.  And to put the icing on the cake each boxed set comes with a senitype of a piece of 35-millimeter film frame from the movie.  Mine happened to be of Jasmine and Aladdin flying on the magic carpet during the song a whole new world. <br /> <br />Overall the movie is a must bye if you are a Disney lover.  You may not want to spend the money on the gift box set for yourself, but if this is going to be a present for the holidays it is worth the money. <br />
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is a great album. You can actually turn this album on and sit through the whole thing. Like another reviewer, I'm not too fond of the sitars, but they work alright on this album. This album shows the Beatles at their best, writing some of the greatest songs ever (Taxman, Eleanor Rigby, For No One) and lots of different genres: Hard Rock (Dr. Robert, And Your Bird Can Sing, She Said She Said, Taxman), Pop (Eleanor Rigby, Here There and Everywhere, Got to Get you into my Life, I Want to Tell You, I'm Only Sleeping), Excellent songs that put a smile on your face (Good Day Sunshine), as well as wonderful lyrics.<br /><br />Check this album out.
1591840562|5.0|As an entrepreneur, I was touched and inspired by this book-something that happens far too infrequently with most business books I read. <br /> <br />Guy was a Macintosh evangelist for Apple before he started Garage.com, which later turned into Garage Technology Ventures. Guy is now a Silicon Valley VC, and has obviously seen tons of crappy pitches, which is clearly part of the inspiration for this book. <br /> <br />His book, The Art of the Start, is a useful plan for starting a business. <br /> <br />Early on, Guy tries to make the case that the book is useful for both entrepreneurs starting new businesses as well as those currently toiling to create new ventures inside behemoth companies. He starts strong with this concept, but this idea kind of goes by the wayside as the book progresses, and I personally think he should have left it out entirely. Buy this book if you are trying to start a company and raise money, but not if you are trying to deal with big company politics. <br /> <br />I loved the structure Guy uses in this book. <br /> <br />Each chapter ends with a helpful FAQ section (Frequently Avoided Questions). I found these clever and interesting. Questions range from: \\"Should we take into account the availability of domain names when we name the organization?\\" to \\"How can one protect an idea, given that few investors will sign an NDA (nondisclosure agreement)?\\" <br /> <br />Guy also includes various \\"minichapters\\" throughout the book. For instance, there is a minichapter on using email effectively, which includes tips from etiquette to CC rules. <br /> <br />All in all, I enjoyed the organization of the book and the countless ideas and advice. I've already used his section on giving proposals and have reworked mine to 10 slides and use 30 point fonts. I practiced one over and over in front of an audience to get the time down to 15 minutes. <br /> <br />There is a lot of painfully obvious stuff in here, as well. Stuff like \\"sweat the big stuff\\" is probably obvious to a lot of people, but we could all use a reminder from time to time. A friend of mine recently spent a great deal of time worrying about some minor business details, such as his business cards and the way a picture on his website was cropped. I couldn't believe he was wasting time on these issues when his product development hasn't even begun. <br /> <br />Another great piece of advice is to just get going. You're probably going to make a ton of mistakes regardless of how much time you spend on your business plan or marketing strategy. Just get going and revise later once you see how the market reacts. <br /> <br />All in all, this book has reenergized me and invigorated me. It was kind of like a virtual pep talk from Guy himself. <br /> <br />Oh, and make sure you take the book jacket off and look inside it. It's fun.
B000088E6D|5.0|Most exciting and sexy voice I've ever heard. He's enticing and very, very soothing to listen to. <br /> <br />Can you say HOT!!!! <br /> <br />He gives me Fever just like the song.
0385510438|3.0|No suspense at all in this book... it's a wandering tale of life in a small Southern town. The author meanders through 9 years of this and that, finally wrapping up with a touching ending. A nice story, more in the style of Eudora Welty than a murder mystery or suspense novel. The characters are memorable and nicely written, but all through the volume I kept wondering where it was going. I enjoyed it, but I'm notoriously easy to please.
0446310786|4.0|I was fortunate enough to read To Kill a Mockingbird when I was in 9th grade. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The book is absolutely amazing, but like most books, has a few boring parts. But that can be easily overlooked. My favorite characters were Atticus and Boo Radley, who, when we finally met him, was in my opinion, awesome. Definitely worth reading.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|I've seen Peter on the late night shows and he just gets better and better.  The title track is simple and beautiful; it's one of those songs that seems to have been around forever.  The rest of the CD is just as good; his take on \\"Bali Hai\\" needs to be heard.  Looking forward to seeing him in \\"Beyond the Sea\\"!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Ferrell makes yet another memorable splash on the big screen in Jon Favreau's sweet and hilarious Christmas fable. Ferrell is Buddy, an innocent figure who was raised as an elf in the North Pole by his adoptive father, Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). When Buddy discovers that he's actually a human being, he heads to New York City to reunite with his biological father. The trouble is that his dad, Walter (James Caan), is a publishing executive who doesn't have time for anything other than work. Buddy moves in with Walter and his family, and proceeds to teach them a lesson or two about what being a family really means. Meanwhile, he also falls head over heels in love with the incredibly cute department store clerk, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel). By the time Christmas Eve rolls around, the general lack of spirit in the air threatens to ground Santa for the big night. He must rely on Buddy's expertise and overall enthusiasm to ensure that Christmas will be saved once again. Favreau's film is family entertainment at its finest, featuring a performance by Ferrell that is at once innocent, tender, and laugh-out-loud funny. A stellar supporting cast--including Caan, Deschanel, Newhart, and Faizon Love--adds to the film's already overabundant charm. <br />
0800141628|5.0|A wonderful, classic coming of age adventure-drama that will never get old, Stand By Me is truly a classic story of friendship that is unusual in being centered around pre-teen characters who are as enjoyable and engaging as any adults. Not to be missed. Yet another 80's classic where the young show the adults how it's done.
068987474X|3.0|Why pay $20 for the book when the title says it all?  Have you ever \\"not called\\" or \\"blew off\\" a guy you really, really liked because you were scared/busy/insecure/intimidated??  Probably not. <br /> <br />I don't understand why most women are constantly looking to be reassured.  Why do you think you are so insecure in the first place?  Is it because you are constantly sizing yourself up to other people?  Is it because spend all your time putting on makeup instead of reading books? <br /> <br />I have a friend who I want to buy this book for, but it would probably get thrown back in my face.  Her problem - she can't handle rejection.  But the reason guys reject her is because she is too insecure and neurotic to just go with the flow, act natural and be herself.  It's an endless cycle, ladies. <br /> <br />Anyway, if your reading this review, I'm glad I'm not you. <br />

B0001LJC2K|4.0|I bought this album with the knowledge that Muse are a great band. What I didn't realise is how great they actually are. Yes they are obviously influenced by the mighty radiohead, yes they write weird but amazing songs like radiohead but their is one big similarity between the two bands. They can keep you transfixed to your stereo throughout every song without you looking for a track you recognise. I get slightly angry when people say that this style has been done before, which modern band doesn't replicate the bands they idolise? Muse are an intelligent rock band, so it might take a while for someone to get to grips with the music they are listening to. Everyone I know who has listened to Absolution has liked it. Probably my favourite song on the album is Stockholm Syndrome and Hysteria comes a close second, look just give the album a go, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. <br />Incase your wondering, I didn't give it 5 stars because they're not completely original, but don't let this affect you.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Read some of the more negative reviews of this album here on amazon and felt i just had to respond. <br /> <br />Maybe this album is an 80s copy, but I would choose it over any album it is copying any day.  Yeah the beats on all of the songs are pretty much the same, but you can really get into this and bang your head around! You have to love the euro-styled voice of Alex as he speaks over some driving guitar and drum beats.   <br /> <br />A few reasons to buy this album: <br /> <br />Reason #1: The best song on the album: 'Matinee' <br />I can listen to this over and over again...it's got LEVELS JERRY, LEVELS! <br /> <br />Reason #2: Raise your arm and pound your fists to 'This Fire' as your leisure suit goes out of style and the drugs wear off! It will get any party going faster than Beenie man's 'who am I'. <br /> <br />Reason #3: 'Michael' - despite what all the homophobes say, this is a great song, provides a bit of comic relief.  Sing it to your girlfriend, she'll love you for it. <br /> <br /> <br />BUY BUY BUY!

0385507755|5.0|This book is truly amazing.  It chronicles the period from the lowest point in an addict's life (when he is totally out of control) through detox (and potential recovery).  If you have ever wondered what people in this situation are thinking and how it could happen, this book gives you an insight to the way their mind is working and some glimpses into the pathology of addiction.  The fact that the main character is someone you can relate to makes this all the more believeablle, a fairly bright person, good family, unremarkable childhood - not the stereotypical 'addict' of our preconceptions.  I highly recommend this book.
0393314804|5.0|Trainspotting was my first Irvine Welsh novel. Trainspotting is about scottish junkies who try so hard to keep themselves entertained. They keep themselves entertained with violence, drugs, sex and music. Mark Renton is the meain character. Renton goes in and out of his drug abuse. While \\"in\\" his drug abuse stage he hallucinates himself in a nightmare. While \\"out\\" he tries to find a job, a relationship and most importantly the meaning of life.   Trainspotting has very unique characters. Every character in Trainspotting has his/her own strong importance in the novel. Mark Renton sticks close to his friends through his journey in finding the meaning of life. Reading in phonetic spelling wasn't quite easy. Irvine Welsh took the choice and enhancing the reading with real scottish talk. Having phonetic spelling in the novel made me feel like I was more involved with the book.   The actions used in this novel keeps you interested and catches you off guard. Having characters like Begbie reminds you of the alchoholic people that are out there. Begbie's always starting unecessary fights with people that have done him no harm. Sick Boy is the nicer version of Mark Renton, with a little [...] side. Irvine Welsh has a unique way of describing the important scenes.   Irvine describes such situations with in depth detail of body parts, song lyrics, dialog combinding and the flavor of objects. I recommend this book to people who want to read any of Irvine Welsh's books. You HAVE to go through Trainspotting to get to Glue, Filth or Ecstasy because of the phonetic spelling. (only if you're new at it) I recommend it to the people out there that are looking for a new way of reading and like hearing about the foreign, lowlife, sexually frustrated way of living.
B00006RIO7|1.0|The soundtrack to the revival musical is much better. Not only are its renditions of the songs heard in the movie WAY BETTER, but you hear a lot of songs that the movie's missing.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Melodic Keys: <br /> <br /> A talented young woman with grace, style, originality, and an amazing voice, Alicia Keys is definitely one in a million.  Unlike other young female R & B singers, Keys' music is filled with mature, soulful, and inspiring lyrics that invoke emotions like none other.  Her lyrics encourage woman to be strong, beautiful, and to seek substance in relationships rather than superficial happiness.  Besides lyrics, Keys' smooth piano skills sooth her listeners ears.  Keys' level of musicality is evident in her first album.   <br /> <br /> Keys' first album, Songs in A Minor, is a mellow-smooth compilation with amazing songs such as; A Woman's Worth, Caged Bird, and Butterflyz.  My favorite song of this album, Fallin, is about the foolish and paradoxical emotions that come with \\"falling\\" in love.  Keys poetically inquires; \\"How do you give me so much pleasure/And cause me so much pain/Just when I think/I've taken more than would a fool/I start fallin' back in love with you.\\"  After listening to Keys' first album, people will be unable to resist purchasing her second one. <br /> <br /> With more jazz and edge than her first album, The Diary of Alicia Keys, is certainly a good investment.  In my opinion, even better than her first album, The Diary of Alicia Keys is truly a journal into the life, and secrets of this talented woman.  The song that truly shines on this album is entitled, If I Ain't Got You.  This song is about the insignificance of superficial objects, and the importance of being with one's true love.   More of a narration, Keys expresses; \\"Some people want diamond rings/Some just want everything/But everything means nothing/If I ain't got you.\\"  Key's second album has certainly matched, and surpassed the success of her debut album. <br /> <br /> This second album is for all ages, and genders.  It contains no vulgar language that may be inappropriate for children, and it is inspiring for women and men in all types of situations.  The smoothness of this album is appropriate for the car ride home, a romantic evening with a significant other, background music for studying, or for simply relaxing from a long, tiresome week.  Whatever the occasion or situation may be, The Diary of Alicia Keys, is fitting.   <br /> <br />So for all you guys out there who want a special gift for your lady, and for all you ladies who want some inspiration in your life, go out and get Alicia Keys: Songs in A Minor, and The Diary of Alicia Keys, and Keys' melodic melodies will give you \\"butterflyz\\".     <br />
B000062Y98|5.0|Give Blind Guardian credit for being the only band to improve with each new record.I listen to their first album and then to this, and it seems like two completly different bands.In the beginning, they didn't know the meaning of the word: variation, and layers of sounds and guitar textures and melodic fills were sorely absent.The drummer fixed in a constant pattern did't helped at all.And it's in the drum parts were you can tell the most evolution of Blind Guardian from trying to be Helloween to trying to be the best in the genre.And they achieved that and then some! Some bands label themselves progressive or of being a metal opera (Avantasia, for instance) and they are light years away from being a Jesuschrist Superstar with metal guitars.But Blind Guardian reach that goal here, making a record that (especially in the choruses)resembles that classic rock opera work: full of variation, finesse, profoundity, progressiveness, etc.In fact, it's so progressive that (soaring) melodic vocal lines you hear in a song sometimes doesn't appear never again.And each song features several different structures and moods that makes every single work a masterpiece and a musical feast for the ears and soul, let alone a breathtaking journey.So called progressive bands should take a note or ten from this guys! <br />The production let somethings to be desired: more clarity in the instruments and voices.But there is so much going on here that it surely must have been a tough job mixing it all up. <br />You are in front of a work of art randomly made by a band of the metal genre, i can only think of the best works of Maiden matching this in sheer quality and vision.This is a musical testament for the ages that i don't think Blind Guardian will ever achieve again (and i don't think they would even try to), so this is highly recommended for anyone. <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|I've appreciated U2's music for years and this album is simply disappointing. The best way for me to describe it is like a one hit wonder. It sounds like the millions of one-hit-wonder bands you hear, that create one great song just to get you to buy the CD and the rest are weak. With albums like this from great artists like U2 its no wonder the record industry has problems with pirates. It's good the CD was less than $10, but in my opinion it's not worth more than $1. U2 fans, be prepared for disappointment.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I saw this film the first night that it came out and I must admit, I just don't get it... I didn't get it then, or since.  Other than the memorable \\"lick my stockings\\" scene, I found there was very little to like about this \\"About Schmidt\\" type melodrama. <br /> <br />It was just a story  of a fading celebrity that finds himself lonely in a town of millions of people.  The people of the country are made to be as celebrity obsessed as US movie fans, which I found in poor taste. <br /> <br />But it did so well at the box office and the nominations?! Even for fans of Bill Murray's too few dramatic roles, I just didn't get the appeal... I went to donate mine to our public library, but they said that they already had too many copies in a branch library system of over 25 locations.  I guess they didn't get it either. <br /> <br />Bill Murray is always a good box office draw... I just wish that his agent AND Mr. Murray could have seen the writing on the wall of this flop.
0156421178|4.0|Orwell's book is a chronicle of the Spanish Civil War through the author's eyes, but it is far more interesting as a meditation on war, politics, journalism, and idealism.  Orwell's real strength lies in candid self-analysis, and his experiences sitting in the miserable trenches of Catalonia and witnessing political squabbles in Barcelona are vaulted from their particular dated circumstances and given universal significance.  This is not a work of genius, but it is a personal and very human look at war, probably more relevant now than it was when it was written.  Spain has changed considerably, as has the art of war, but human nature in times of conflict is very much the same.
B0006399FS|1.0|How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb <br /> <br />Artist: U2 <br />(Island/Universal) <br /> <br />Reviewer: SUJESH PAVITHRAN <br />  <br />THIS is, for a good part of the proceedings, an awfully strident album - grating and eardrum-shattering at certain points, loud and clamorous at others. When it does get quiet, it still sounds like too many undesirable things are going on. Now that we've this out of the way, let's examine the evolution/degeneration (depending on your perspective) of the Irish band, once comprising quite possibly four of the most important musicians in the world of popular music. <br /> <br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb sees U2 at the crossroads - whether to return to roots (ie, the 1980s) or to keep forging ahead with the controversial, fan-alienating techno approach of the past dozen years. Ultimately, they copped out and walked the line, turning up the levels on the mix and adding generous layers of pointless noise to what could basically have been a good, workmanlike rock album of a vintage disposition. <br /> <br /> <br />Just listen to certain sections of one song somewhere deep into the album - A Man and a Woman - and you'll get what I mean. There's the old U2 surfacing, provided old-time fans a tantalising glimpse of what might have been, before things return to the less rosy present. <br /> <br /> <br />It's not that the songs are bad - in fact, melodically, there are an obscene number of decent, rock-era U2-type songs here, starting with the explosive opener, Vertigo ? tunes like Miracle Drug, Love and Peace or Else, All Because of You (why does Desire keep ringing in my ears?), A Man and a Woman and One Step Closer all show signs that Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr may have closely re-examined their earlier and more recent approaches to songwriting and decided to go with the former. <br /> <br /> <br />But they had to spoil it all with the production, thanks no doubt in part to longtime associate Steve Lillywhite who,ironically, helmed the console during U2's best years as well. He's not the only one, though - you find familiar names like Flood, Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno turning up in the credits as well!  <br /> <br /> <br />The Edge's atmospheric guitar work used to be a signature in itself - here it sounds too rough, jostling with the synths (and other things in the mix) to re-establish an identity. You only have to pull out your copy of The Unforgettable Fire, October or even The Joshua Tree (the last relevant U2 album, for me at least) to realise how nicely minimalism and organic tones worked for the band. <br /> <br /> <br />It all sounds a bit artificial here, like Mullen's drum sounds (which have never been the same since Achtung Baby) ? there used to be lots of space within U2's music, now there's just a lot more happening in the mix, which is both distracting and exasperating. The opening track should be enough of a warning to those who would proceed with the rest of the album. <br /> <br /> <br />Finally, lyrically, the album did little for me, which I felt was a rather sad reflection on U2's relevance - or lack of it - these days. <br /> <br /> <br />Decent songs, pity about the production, which used to be a crucial factor in U2's scheme of things back then. They seem to have forgotten how it should work. <br /> <br /> <br />Who knows, perhaps they really meant to call this How to Dismantle a Rock Band. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
