B001AGXEA6|4.0|The movie itself is great.  It was done at what was probably the height of Michael Keaton's acting career.  During the same time frame he did Clean and Sober, Beetlejuice and the first two Batman movies.  He actually was not in the movie as much as I remember when I saw it in the theater years ago, but he pretty much steals every scene he is in.  Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin do a great job in their roles as the dead couple trying to spook the buyers out of their house, and Winona Ryder is very good as the awkward teen who can see the ghosts.  It very much has the look and feel of Tim Burton's other movies, and given that it was made before the modern special effect era some of the effects are cheesy, but not distracting from the movie.<br /><br />The only drawback is that there is no commentary or making of, or other featurettes.  Given that everyone involved in the movie is still alive it should not have been that hard to get at least some of them together to give some substance to the extras.  All you get there are a few cartoons and the theatrical trailers.  That is why I knocked it down a star.  If you already own the movie on DVD you probably do not have to get the Blu Ray.  It is not going to get you much better video or audio quality than the DVD and you are not getting extras that are not on the DVD.  If you do not already own it, and don't mind just owning the movie itself then it is worth the purchase.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I have the PC minecraft and 360 version and this one was a total downer. The size of the world you can go on is pathetic. There is barely any blocks to choose from. Also there is no mods, or skins. I would suggest buying the PC version and not this version
B009IF7V2S|1.0|For all of the talented actors in this movie and the possibility of this being a hilarious movie, you are purposely disappointed.  The writing is crude and the humor is so pedestrian that you think you are seeing a SNL sketch drawn out to terrible lengths.  I would truly not waste my time, my family's time nor anyone that I remotely knew in watching this movie.  My 14 year old son thought it was boring.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is not only very well-written from a technical point of view but the plot is one of the most interesting I have come across in a long time.  It's clever and witty with interesting turns of phrase.  Furthermore, it provides food for thought about the relationships between men and women in general and husbands and wives in particular, and the roles we assume in our conjugal relationships.<br />Each chapter transitions easily from the last and into the next, leaving the reader wondering what can possibly happen next.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I enjoyed the mature content and the interaction between Streep and Jones.  I would recommend this movie. I wish that we had more movies about older love affairs and marriage.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I've read that is a book for young people around 10 to 12 years old but I would recommend to people of any age.  Sad, poignant with a wonderful ending.  I hope the book gets the many readers and recommendations it deserves
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Not worth the hour and a half or more of your time.  Have someone else pay for it and tell you about it.  Or, better yet, donate to Wikipedia and read the movie description.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I was a bit unsure after reading some reviews but being a huge Beatles fan, I could not pass on the new Beatles box set - especially with a limited number of pressings.  The shipment arrived loose in a bigger box and the outer box set slide in sleeve had a very slight mark - not enough to send back although it would have been great to get it in perfect condition.  The inner box and albums are perfect.  I listened to some of the LP's that others had problems with and mine appear to be perfect.  The sound is awesome on every album I played - great fidelity, no hiss or warpage.  I am thrilled that I took the plunge and have new copies of the entire Beatles catalog at one the best prices on the net.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|If you are born in the 70s, played D&D as a kid, read fantasy books, played video games and watched Japanese cartoons this book is extraordinary, unmissable and you will not be able to put it down once started.<br />If you don't fit in the above box you still enjoy the book but will be just a very good book.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|DeMille does a great job of developing Corey and at times seems to go a bit too deep into some descriptions of other characters...can drag on at times. All that being said, the ending is great and a very intriguing story line.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|A &#34;realistic&#34; look at humanity when faced with a major catastrophe. The catastrophe in this case is a vampire apocalypse. Again, the take home message is that the catastrophe is not the problem, it is human beings and all of their flaws that will be the end of humanity as we know it.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|What I appreciate about Tim Ferriss' books is their value: he packs so much information into his books that you can't really go wrong and everyone will find something useful within the covers.  The Kindle version is only $9.99 so it's a steal.  (it views very well on the Kindle Fire BTW.)  He also provides a lot of links to additional info on his website.<br /><br />I cook for a living and still learned some fun ideas in this one.  And it's got a lot more than cooking info.  Definitely worth the read!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Although I am still waiting to see how the whole story and all of the various angles and characters tie together, it is an entertaining, suspenseful, sick and twisted look at mental health care in the 60's and how barbaric it was then. If course, this show is not meant to be a social commentary, but they use this fact as the perfect backdrop for a &#34;real life&#34; house of horrors. I love this season, and it is better then the first.
B008CX2A2I|5.0|This might not be that exciting for some of you, but with the tech saavy music junkies, it's a beautiful thing! Had a little trouble at first getting it to read my iPhone but after I got my head out of my rear, I was the trouble. Anyway, I do have my big flash drive in the USB port most of the time, but when my friends come over and want to hear a song on the Bose Acoustimass 10, it's simple, pair it, then play it!!! They think its really neat you can do this with a receiver!!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I rented this movie for the &#34;fat Amy&#34; character, because I LOVE the actress who plays her, and she DID NOT DISAPPOINT! The music was fun, and the movie was cute, but did I absolutely love it? Nah, but I liked it and I think that it is a nice way to spend 90 minutes with a friend or loved one.
B000ICXQU6|4.0|Very solid mainstream film, and Julia Roberts gives best, toughest performance of her career. As always Soderbergh assembles an excellent ensemble, and keeps the story moving, with just enough poignancy. Reminds me a of a more lighthearted Silkwood.
B001KZG99A|5.0|This movie is, without a doubt, one of the greatest comic-book live-action movies of all time.  Even though Robert Downey Jr would have to be one of the last people I ever would have picked for the role of Tony Stark, he pulls it off like a champ.  This is truly a must see!
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I can't give an accurate rating on this game. I tried several times to download it and wouldn't,  I'm sure I wouldn't hate the game since I'm a Star Wars fan and I've been eager to play it.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|It might get loud was a very good dvd and I would really recommend it for anyone to listen to
048623231X|5.0|I purchased this book for my mother, who is an artist, and she loves to draw from Dore's inspiration. Dante's work is so detailed, rich and amazing it deserves expert art to grab hold of the vision of the Divine Comedy. This book captures these images very well. If you are looking for inspiration or an neat coffee table book for conversation this will not disappoint.

B003DT19F0|4.0|Disney has done a very good job and making the &#34;direct to DVD&#34; movie quality and entertaining. My daughter loves Tinkerbell and this DVD movie, though not great, is very good and fun for the audience it seeks to entertain.
B008220AVW|5.0|Saw the movie and loved it. Knew that when it came out on DVD I needed to get it!! Totally WOW!
B000VECAEO|4.0|What can you say at the end of nine seasons? How bout' that was it??? The season starts off great and then leading up to the end is just a bit of a let down. Even the Puerto Rican Day episode is in the set, which is banned from TV because of PC crap. Actually the episode should have been banned for not being funny. It was almost as bad as the series finale. Perhaps it was good they ended when they did because the laughs were getting fewer and harder to find.
B000YHG72E|4.0|A new classic holiday movie. It just doesn't feel like Christmas time at our house until we watch Elf at least once.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Loved the mingled strands of her past and the immediate present as she struggled to understand past relationships and to nurture tenuous friendships on the trail. The narrative of her difficult trek through beautiful wilderness could have been monotonous, and the story of her earlier life by itself could have been unrelentingly harsh, but woven together they made a balanced and compelling memoir. Exceeded expectations.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app has alot of great stuff. but it stops were u r in a game otherwise it is awesome like me. :)
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie is so funny!  I expected it to be funny and wasn't disappointed.  There is a romantic sub-plot, but not so much that men won't like it anyway.  There are some one-liners that my husband and I will be quoting for sure!  Some of the humor is crude, but that's to be expected.  See this movie, its good stuff!
0345803493|5.0|This series is an either Love it or hate it. I don't think you can be in between. Some reviews say it is too much like the characters in the Twilight movies, but I read the books before I heard that, and I don't see it at all. BUT if you read the first book, you MUST read them all because so much happens and is explained in the other books!
0399247459|1.0|Book was in good conditions. but CD was missing... Not worth the hassle to do return shipping...Very disappointed with this purchase as my toddler loves this book :(
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Disappointing. Drugs & low self-esteem. Kept re-reading. Written in main characters voice.<br />No plot. Repetitive & sometimes just dumb. Do not like this &#34; journal&#34; type writing.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Because nothing even remotely interesting happened so I decided to read a book instead (\\"Swimming Home\\" by Deborah Levy).<br />I'm glad I did not pay to go see this, I would have fallen asleep.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|You can look at other reviews to see them rave about how good this game is. I'm just going to talk about how immersive it is.<br /><br />The story is good, but that's not even the main drawing point as far as I'm concerned. It's all about the careful time management involved with the social links and dungeon crawling. I've had more fun trying to figure out how best to spend each &#34;day&#34; in persona 4 than I have in a long time with a video game.  I've literally wasted days away playing this game and enjoying every minute of it.<br /><br />watch out, it's addictive.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett creates some interesting characters and fleshes them out enough for the reader to identify with and care about.  His use of historical facts are generally right-on the mark.<br />The biggest problem I had with this historical novel, revolving around WWI, is the exclusion of Turkey's participation as an ally with Germany.  Most notably the failed amphibian attempt by Great Britain & its allies at Gallipoli where thousands died by miserable planning and execution of the British Navy. Hardest hit were the Australians and New Zealanders and Turks.  Later in WWII that particular failed attempt gave Hitler pause in launching  an attack of the British Isles which would have likely changed the outcome of WWII.  The other significant event of Turkey's involvement was the post war reparations: Turkey lost what is now referred to as the Middle East with its rich source of oil.  These events had a major influence on today's geo-fiscal politics.<br />Never the less, the book's story follows the major players of the war and is a rousing tale sure to keep you enthralled.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|One of the top westerns ever, IMHO, and this is the full 165 minute version, not the 148 min Paramount-chopped-for-U.S.<br />version. Henry Fonda's eyes never looked bluer than as this cold-blooded gunman.
B003QS9VYE|5.0|We read the book, and daughter was so captivated by book, we rented movie and loved it! I highly recommend!
B005XN2ZUC|5.0|Started watching the second season on television and loved it. So I bought the first season to catch up. Its become a family favorite
0307477479|2.0|I can't remember why I bought this book, but I think I had heard about it, and it was on the best-sellers list, so I took a chance. Wish I had those dollars back. For me, it was one of those trendy books that some people really like, but it was an effort for me to complete.  Some of the characters are likeable, but overall,it was an unfortunate choice.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Really easy to set up and use..but like anything, you've got to use it on a regular basis to really get something good out of it.  I wish I would've had this tool earlier.<br /><br />Recommended if you are serious about learning how to play
B006R1T40I|3.0|I've always been very fond of Bonnie Raitt, and admire her music and her longevity.  Unfortunately, at least on the one hearing I've had, this is tired and disappointing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thank you amazon for having the best choices available!! The Walking Dead continues to be one of my favorites!  I am so addicted!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love the unpredictability. Could not guess the outcome ahead of time. Great acting. I also think it was balanced in its approach to who were the bad and good guys with sometimes it overlapping like in life.
B009POCG2C|4.0|Ah, finally a down to earth movie, without guns and special effects,, just a little<br />baseball story with a bunch a great actors.  Clint Eastwood has earned my respect<br />will all those movies he starred in. He was a great young man, and now he is a<br />great old man. I still would pay for a movie about him talking to a chair.<br /> But here, we have characters, baseball stuff...scouts....and other older actors.<br />Solid story, solid acting...its actually a baseball movie..a love story ..and<br />a hope story as we're all hoping that the right actions are taken.<br />  Just like other great baseball movies, this one will find its place with the rest. And also, finally they gave Big John Goodman a decent role where he does nt<br />have to torture or kill anyone like his previous roles in the past few years.<br />Good actor and actresses shine when you have a decent script.<br /><br />A keeper.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Do no work, no good for kindle fire hd 7, need to be fix, I try when repair it ok.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast paced easy reading. Gets you hooked from the first chapter. Lots of action and a great story line. Very creative thinking from Sue Collins.
B00395ZYVS|3.0|The book holds no interest.  I'm not compelled to read, very predictible.  Its for my bookclub so I will finish.  No substaance to any of the characters, other than the birth mother.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|I seen the Goonies before,it was hilarious,Characters where great.Watch it with your family and hear the laughter. Buy it now.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Great product quality, long lasting, well-built. Husband games daily, and wouldn't live without these headphones! Excellent purchase with great results.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We went to see this in the theatre but wanted a copy at home. Great overall message. I love the characters, graphics and bits of humor that relate to real life. I highly recommend all families to watch this one together.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|WOOL<br />SLOW START, BUT REALLY PICKED UP AND I LIKED IT A LOT.  WOULD LIKE TO BUY THE FOLLOWING BOOKS.  GOOD READ
B009AMANBA|5.0|LINCOLN starts off like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN: people fighting and dying for war. In Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the scale of D-Day was astonishing and gruesome. This memorable first scene sets the tone throughout the entire movie -- even if characters make jokes an hour into the movie, it was hard to fully remove yourself from how truly awful war was. While LINCOLN's first scene doesn't hold nearly the same grand scale that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's did, it serves the same function. We're made to look upon brothers fighting in the rain, in the mud, with their bare hands if they had to. It's a short scene, but the rest of the movie is haunted by the thought of these men -- all around the country -- fighting and dying for what's going on in Washington DC.<br /><br />It's often hard for big studio pictures to equal the sum of its parts -- not so for 2012's LINCOLN. On the outset, I was super excited for this movie: it's got one of the best living directors heading it (Steven Spielberg) with one of the best living actors leading it (Daniel Day Lewis) about one of the most significant moments in American (and human) history (the ratification of the 13th amendment) from the perspective of one of America's most beloved presidents (Abraham Lincoln). But wait! There's more: a DP that can make anything look cinematic and beautiful (Janusz Kaminski) and a cast of some of the best actors in supporting roles (Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Lee Pace, John Hawkes, James Spader, Walton Goggins, Jackie Earle Haley, Michael Stuhlbarg, and plenty of others). It seems that a movie like LINCOLN would never be able to live up to its pedigree -- but it does. LINCOLN is one of the best movies of 2012, and I can't think of anyone I wouldn't recommend this movie to.<br /><br />First, I'd like to clarify that this movie is not a biopic in the traditional sense -- it's not a movie about the life of Abraham Lincoln. LINCOLN is about Abraham Lincoln's attempt to ratify the (then controversial) 13th amendment to the United States Constitution. If you're not familiar with the story already, the 13th amendment clarified that equal rights ought to be provided for all people, of all creed and race. In today's time, this sensibility seems like nothing special, but in the 19th century, it divided the nation. Getting congress to ratify any amendment can be an arduous process, but Lincoln was up against near-insurmountable odds: he faced a split (and nearly hostile) congress and a strict time line (he wanted to pass it before his re-inauguration after his re-election). Oh, and let's not forget that the entire country was at war with itself in the bloody and brutal Civil War. This is what the movie is about: we pick up in the middle of the civil war, just after President Lincoln's re-election, and the movie ends just short of the amendment's ratification.<br /><br />The film is based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book TEAM OF RIVALS. Spielberg and (screenwriter) Tony Kushner do well to shrink the scope of their story. Rather than trying to cover every element of Abraham Lincoln's life, they focus in on one of the most pivotal moments of his life and of American history. Working on this smaller scale, Spielberg is able to capture the drama of it all -- there are clear story arcs at work here. LINCOLN is excellently paced with plenty of moments of drama, suspense, and even comedy. The movie never for a moment feels like a history lesson. The political maneuverings are fun to watch and, even if you know the story, feel cinematic. Spielberg never gets jingoistic about America either -- there's a sense of patriotism here, but it's earned by watching the characters on screen fighting for human rights, rather than hollow platitudes.<br /><br />There's considerable buzz that Daniel Day Lewis is a shoe-in for the Best Actor Oscar, and the hype is warranted. Lewis is good in pretty much everything he does, but he genuinely disappears as Lincoln. While watching the movie, I would forget that the character on screen wasn't the actual Abraham Lincoln. He comes across as stern, stoic, and infinitely wise. Through the movie, it appears to be a defeated man, but he is still able to find the beauty in moments with his young son, or camaraderie with his staff with a few jokes. I wouldn't say that Lewis steals the show though (as he did in THERE WILL BE BLOOD) -- the rest of the cast is phenomenal. Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens (the staunch, idealistic congressman) is excellent; James Spader as W.N. Bilbo (as hired gun sent out to obtain votes from on-the-fence congressmen) is hilarious; Michael Stuhlbarg as George Yeaman (the nervous, on-the-fence Democrat) is great. I really could go on -- the acting is superb.<br /><br />LINCOLN is one of the best movies I've seen in 2012. While there is a bit of foul language (and violence in the first scene), I would recommend this movie highly to anyone interested in it.g the movie, I would forget that the character on screen wasn't the actual Abraham Lincoln.

0446580848|1.0|The only reason I gave this even 1 star is because of my loyalty to DeMille and John Corey. But holy crap what a bad book. I only forced myself to read through the whole thing so I could be complete in my reading of the Corey books. But like all other 1 star readers have said in their reviews, this book was not even in the same league as the others. I would estimate the whole 450 middle pages were painfully detailed about...plot making and the land of Yemen and its people. No action whatsoever. Not what we've come to expect with Corey stories (many plot twists and encounters with the bad guy). The lame encounter with the Panther in this book happened in the last 5 pages! I didn't even like or hate any of the supporting characters. And the relationship between Kate and John was totally boring this time around. It took me 2 months of putting down and picking back up to finally finish this dreck. Very disappointing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Fun and addicting, this game deserves every one of its five stars! Plenty of replay value as the coins change every round.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Perfect for what I need. Easy to use and works exactly as described. Better than my regular clock............  great puchase!
031606792X|5.0|Read the first three and couldn't find the final book. Great read, the hard back cover saved it from creases.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I don't understand the comments in previous reviews about the book being boring, even recommendations to skip it. I am very nearly done with this volume and it has held me as much in thrall as the rest. I love the way the stories criss-cross in subtle ways. We learn about other characters who may not have their own chapters in this book, and some characters meet or brush past one another in their believable journeys and experiences.<br />The title of the book is an apt description, since this is a followup to the outcomes of many a battle begun in previous books, resulting in so many corpses,  &#34;food for crows&#34; as well as the double entendre referring to plenty to do for the men who guard the North, who hold the Wall, who take vows for the Black-- the &#34;Crows.&#34;<br />This book continues the saga with the same literary and story-telling virtuosity of the first three. I can barely wait till I can open the next volume, Dances with Dragons, in which I hear the concurrent story of many characters who are in the distance or sidelines in this one, are told.<br />And yet, I feel like slowing down my reading pace so it will last longer!<br />Great writing. Great books, including this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just the kind of calculator for every day use. With it percentage key can be used every where. It was just what I were looking for. Love it.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Ordered Monday afternoon when released & amazingly got it Tuesday . Good CD especially 4 r 5 of songs .
B00A77II0U|3.0|This game kept my attention. I enjoyed the storyline, but wished it lasted longer.<br />One problem I encountered was the app froze about 4 times on my kindle HD Fire.<br />I had to exit the game and reopen the app to continue on.<br />The graphics were great.<br />Overall, VERY NICE JOB ALAWAR  ;)
B008S4FZHI|3.0|If you are a hard core Cornwell fan you won't be disappointed, this book uses the same formula as the previous novels. It is well written and an easy enjoyable read.
B001IF252M|5.0|It allows you to connect your MacBook Air or other computer/laptop with DisplayPort to a VGA monitor or projector. What else can be said?
1451695195|3.0|The Vedas, ancient texts of the Hindus, clearly explain that matter and spirit are two different realms.<br /><br />Knowing that the person is not the body is the primal basis of knowledge.  Outside of that is pure ignorance.

B00785P2QC|5.0|this is awesome building ur own city and its really detailed and super addicting to play and enjoys nice game.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I have never written a review for any product before, but this has got to the best CD I've heard in a long time. Every song is great, and their sound is original. If I was going off to a stranded island with only 1 CD, I'd pick this one! Looking forward to their next one!
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|This movie was predictable, but it did blow a lot of things up and at times was funny.  I would not rent again after watching.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|The Lion King is one of my all time favorite Disney movies. Created during the &#34;Disney Renaissance&#34; during the 90s it is one of Disney's best films and resonates well with both children and adults. Has some of Disney's most poignant scenes, and I still cry every time I watch this movie. If you don't already have The Lion King in your collection you're missing out!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This was a great movie.  I really enjoyed the plot and the acting.  The cinematography could have told it's own story.  It was gruesome, but real.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|I LOVE David Tennant, so I went to see this movie in theaters and then bought it mostly because of his fantastic performance in the movie. The rest of the movie is fun too, it doesn't take itself too seriously and portrays vampires for what they are -- devilish monsters (which is refreshing).
B0076DEJMO|4.0|This is a very enjoyable novel, full of irony, humor, and violence. I found it to be a better than some of his other stand-alone novels, although perhaps not as good as the First Law series.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie! One of Pixar's best. I have probably seen this movie a dozen times or more and each time it's like I'm discovering it for the first time. Pixar's specialty seems to be making great children's movies that still resonate with adults and Toy Story definitely does that.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The only bad thing I can say about this book: it is way too short. Translated from Portuguese, I thought it would be hard to follow and only for really clever philosophers or soul searchers.<br />Yet, I enjoyed every single page. What a simple, honest, sincere and wonderful story.<br />Like with the character Forest Gump... I wish I knew the simple sheep herder as a friend. And of course, there's the crux: Never, ever give up on your dream or treasure. Hunt forth!
B009JBWOU0|4.0|This trilogy contains ample material to satisfy those who didn't buy the first two already. For the $18 price I paid, it was a steal. The presentation is fine and the booklet was a nice surprise. It's all most people want or need.
B006M3JVD6|5.0|I wish I could meet Jaycee Dugard. This book, although horrifying, changed my life. It made me realize how quick I complain about nonsense, while this woman endured hell for years. I couldn't put the book down. Sometimes very upsetting - not only what was done to her, but how the legal system let her down - still I turned the pages.<br />The fact that she wrote it herself, included very personal detail and diary entries -  made this not only believable (because at some stage I it was hard to believe what she had to endure), but it made a huge impact on me.<br />I guess one can write about this for hours. Suffice to say: I will never regret purchasing and reading this book. It's powerful, hard-hitting, honest... and it makes one look very hard at oneself.
1419705849|5.0|My son loves the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book series.  Just got him the last book that just came out that is called the third wheel.  He just loves it.  This is a kid that hates reading but when it comes to the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book, he is always reading it until the book is finished then he is waiting to see if another one comes out.  Keep up with the series and add more to it!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|Les Miserables is one of my all-time favorite musicals. I have watched both the 10th and 25th anniversary editions as well gotten the opportunity to see it live on Broadway.<br /><br />Overall, the cast was very good. Alfie Boe (Jean Valjean), Norm Lewis (Javert), and Ramin Karimloo (Enjolras) brought powerhouse vocals to the 25th anniversary production.  I thought Samantha Barks did a wonderful job as Eponine.  Although usually overlooked in reviews, Katie Hall made me actually like Cosette's character for the first time.  I like Jenny Galloway as Madame Thenardier, but her performance wasn't as spirited as in the 10th anniversary.  Matt Lucas is definitely over the top as Thenardier, so that may take some getting used to.  Lea Salonga (Fantine) is enchanting as usual. The only fly in the ointment is Nick Jonas as Marius. For not having much Broadway experience/training, he did a decent job. It is just painful to watch his strained facial expressions.  When put next to some of the other powerhouse vocalists, it makes his vocals seem much weaker than they actually are and takes away from this concert as a whole.<br /><br />However, you won't want to miss the performances at the end of \\"Bring Him Home\\" by four Valjeans including Colm Wilkinson and \\"One Day More\\" by some of the original west end/10th anniversary cast.  The new orchestrations are also a lovely addition.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I think this is one production that is worth seeing if you are a fan of Les Miserables.  However, for the uninitiated or those who only want one concert DVD in their collection, you may want to check out the 10th anniversary concert first.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a really interesting read from many points of view  eg. the way that doctors treated patients in the past - even in the 1960s -1970s and the way that black people were treated by the medical profession. The medical culture of the time and the Lacks family made this book a truly interesting read.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The second I was done watching the first season I immediately wanted to watch the complete second season.  I just hope they don't get stupid with it like so many others do.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Finally the final book.  Everything comes together in the end.  I thoroughly enjoyed these books and wish their had been more.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great video!!! I am not in shape by any means and I definitely felt the level one workout. She had me heaving by the time it was over!! I have not tried levels two or three but I will get there eventually. If you are wanting some cardio and toned muscles I would suggest this DVD!!
B002UNMWAG|5.0|I just love this movie! It's just amazing! The guns, accents, violence. I love that they get justice for the priest.
B000QCTNIW|4.0|Great book lots on how our brains work. I have also remonded this book to a few other people that love it as well
B005LAII08|5.0|I love that I preordered this and got an awesome deal. Although I don't have 3d capabilities, I might in the future. This movie is great. It truly shows real family life and how strong a female character can be.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was my favourite of the series. Great book end to end.  Keeps you guessing and wondering how it will end.
0545265355|5.0|I absolutely love these books! And to get them in a set is even better. I've shared them with the neighbor's kids and my niece. Such an awesomely compelling story of life and death.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Would not recommend it to anyone.  Only read it to see what so many people were talking about -surely there is someone who can write a better novel!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It's worth the watch, especially if you really like family guy. If not, and you appreciate a more sophisticated brand of humor then not so much.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I've never seen a movie get so many one stars and five stars. It's a one joke movie and you have to buy into the joke that a Teddy Bear that comes to life would also grow up; and everyone around Ted accepts it as normal. He smokes pot, chases women, drives a car, gets a job... Yes it is R/Unrated but it is not a gross out comedy like so many other R-rated ones seem to go for. It was a pretty thin year for comedies and I thought this was easily one of the best of the year.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|according to my husband.  He is a huge music fan and loved this book.  He thought Pete was very honest and open about his life.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is one of my very favorite Christmas movies and I believe it's the best version.  Natalie Wood is perfect as the skeptical little girl and the man who plays Santa does a fantastic job.  I am convinced he really was Santa Claus!  :)
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I have one in black and purchased the pink one for my wife.  We are avid backpackers and sometimes our phones take a brutal beating.  I have actually dropped my phone in a creek.  Had it not been for this type of case, I would have probably had to have replaced my iPhone.  Great Product!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book.  I haven't read many Steven King books because I'm not a horror fan, but after seeing the movies for Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile, which I loved, I decided to try this book.  I am a huge fan of time travel novels so this was right up my ally.  Once I started to read this book I could not put it down.  It's one of those books that ruins you for others for awhile once you've finished it because it was just that good.<br />Without going into too much detail, this book told the story of going back in time to save JFK from assassination and all the ramifications of his actions on the future.  I was also pleasantly surprised to find a romantic element to this book as well.  I would definitely recommend this book to my friends and family.
B004EU1YZW|1.0|and won't again. i could see where it was going and geez i wish I had stopped trying to get it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story centering around the investigative prowess of Harry Bosch.  I began reading this novel with the release of the first six chapters and anxiously awaited the release of the entire book.  Another great read from Michael Connelly.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Now that Z-Deals has left this listing I'll update it to reflect the product.  Designed by Google so the fit is obviously perfect!  Probably one of the best bumpers I've owned... great feel, very secure, doesn't add much bulk at all.  The only thing I don't really care for is that it seems to actually provide less grip than the bare phone (if grip is what you're after). USB and headphone ports are large enough to accommodate most accessories.  The area around the side bezel doesn't interfere with the screen which tends to happen with many bumpers: if you're a user of SwipePad then this is a PLUS!<br /><br />For reference, this was my previous (1-star) review based on particular seller because I did not want to pay this seller in order to review them:<br /><br />--- archive ---<br />Watch out!!!  You're being ripped off!  This product was $99, then down to $89 with some bad reviews.  Z-Deals has just now deleted that offer and re-posted this item at $79 thus removing any negative feedback from their old listing.  How shady is that???!!!<br /><br />This is obviously a scalping company buying out as much stock as they can to turn around and sell it at a HUGE premium!  Companies like these are the reason Google is now out of stock and the rest of us have to wait for them to re-stock or pay a horrible company like this $79 ($89 & $99) for a product that ONLY costs $20 straight from Google!!!<br /><br />Go ahead Z-Deals... delete this listing again, I dare you!  I'll keep coming back to show people your true colors!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Clancy books are almost back!  Gets a little strange in the ending.  Look forward to more books from Clancy, etc.
B003TH14H4|5.0|The Castle series has been a guilty pleasure of mine since it started and it just keeps getting better!<br />being able to go back and watch old episodes is something i love to do when there nothing on the<br />wasteland we call TV ! I wish they would make new episodes every week instead of just for 23!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I am not sure why folks like this game so much.  Much of the time it is just a random experience to knock the blocks down to get to the pigs.  So, you have to play the same level over and over until the right combination is found. This is fun?  But then, I am disappointed with about all games that are played on a phone.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Family got me involved with this series.  I watched the original Sherlock Holmes - Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon with actors - Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce (1943) and truly enjoyed the movie.  Of course, now you have Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law which work excellent as partners solving crime.  Plus, the action and Downey's sarcastic attitude, just complement the movie.
B000NY12CI|5.0|A well written personal account of overcoming adversity and acting to correct failures in public systems. A difficult but delightful read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of John Grisham and his story telling since &#34;The Firm&#34; was published.  I have everyone of his novels from the onset and keep anxiously waiting for a new book.  This novel cleary shows Grisham's ideas and experience in story telling.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This has been a family favorite for years -- watched faithfully every Christmas.  This copy was a gift for friends.
B00002DEH3|3.0|Nice performances, but lack the intensity and joy Schubert deserves. Good listening nonetheless. The recording lacks the depth and clarity of others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|5 stars for this book is a joke, it's an infinity star type book. I don't have the words, I would say there aren't enough words in the English language to do this book justice, but that's irony at it's best because Colleen Hoover just used a ton of them to rip my heart out through my eyeballs more than once. I was seriously so captured by this book I paced the room reading with my kindle in my hand because I couldn't drag in enough breath while I was sitting.<br /><br />In her self description Colleen refers to herself as a ninja. I'm sort of convinced at this point she might be right. I thought Slammed and POR were masterpieces, but she will forever be known for writing this book and this book is staying with me forever, it's seriously going to stay with anyone that reads it that has half a heart.<br /><br />Just when you think you're reading a book about a sheltered homeschooled girl that falls for the bad boy....WHAMO....this book takes off in directions you never thought possible. That's a ninja move right there if I've ever seen one. Then it happens again and again and you just don't understand how a single human created this twisted tale!!
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Plenty of speed with a great price from Newegg.com. Great option for my my budget gaming build. Definitely recommend. Just works!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is a master at character creation and consistency with them throughout a series.  Wonderful, rewarding and fast reading.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is awesome everyone must have it. I I I I u u u u ii I I I u
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|The movie was amazing and left me wanting to see more.  The characters and plot were very well done.  The effects and aliens were amazing, not too mention how well done the Master Chief was. I highly recommend this movie and I hope that they decide to make more.
B006O7XOOW|2.0|Nice bright colors, the music and light are nice, but the ballcano is very unstable and slide all the time, the balls pups all the time this toy is boring my nephew just play a little and forget a bought it.
B005HNMPBM|4.0|This was an excellent reboot for the movie franchise.  I think the characters had more depth and range the original movies.  The display of powers was well done and overall the plot was very good.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|Another great production. Eric always picks the best, of the best, and Bill murray make a good introducer. good buy.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Could not stop watching it.  One episode after the other.  Finished the whole season in one day.  Very disappointed to realize I couldn't watch episodes of season 2 already.  It is that good...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|If you have read the others and liked them, you will absolutely love this one.  It is easy reading and funny!
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I think its crap it fricken messed up my ipad I liked it until I realized how stupid it is
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover, you made me a lifetime reader with Slammed. You could put anything out and I would buy it without having to read what it's about. The thing is you just don't put \\"anything\\" out. You put out perfection. Books that make you feel the good, bad and ugly parts of life. Hopeless. Ugh I can't even take how good it was. I knew from the first sentence that it would be perfect. You really had me with that first word. If I could give it a million stars I would. This book, I can't even begin to break it down and talk about its good parts because even the heartbreaking (And they are heartbreaking) parts were great.<br /><br />I think one of my favorite parts of the book is when Six writes Sky a letter about movies and how we shouldn't get mad at movies that have an ugly ending, we should get mad at the happily ever afters because life has ugly parts and life is real.<br /><br />I think what I live most about Colleen's books is that they're beautiful in their realness. Her way with words is beautiful. First butterflying, carving pumpkins and now live. She doesn't just touch on the hard subjects, she holds them with her fists and makes you think. Her characters never seem to get a \\"perfect\\" happily ever after, they get something better. They get a real ever after, if that makes sense.
0399157565|5.0|The lady can write, keeps you from guessing the ending, and holds your attention!  Highly recommend as a good read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this is the first series where I still wanted more at the end. Most books by the end of the second book you are only reading to finish the series. This series I truely wish it went on.
B004GFN11A|5.0|1. I am able to read my blog and others easily. 2. The price is perfect.<br />3 easy to read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was caught in the story by the first page.  I just couldn't put it down.  I wished there was more to it...LOVED IT
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was great.  I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend it.  I think it would make a wonderful movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Truely the best book I've read in years.  From the first page I was caught in the story....by the end of book three I wished there was more...great.
0345803485|1.0|I have read dozens of books in my life and I have never even considered throwing a book away until now. The first book was so bad that I threw it away along with book 2 and 3 without ever even reading them.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I started to read this book for a book club. I read about half of the book by the meeting date. The book did not hold my interest.
1611761174|5.0|This book really brought to life the affect WW II had on families all over the world.  The description of the Pearl Harbor attack was extremely wll done.  I have a lit of empathy for the characters.
1439156816|5.0|I am in the middle of reading this book (yes, I know I should write a review once I'm done with it), but I already know that this book is exactly what I needed at this time of my life. I am writing my first book on how to live a beautiful, abundant life, and I realized that I needed to grow my writing skills in order to communicate my message clearly to others.<br />This book is teaching me so many things that I never heard of, that it made me want to take an English class so I can get the writing tools that Stephen talks about, sharp and organized in my toolbox.<br />Stephen also talks about his life, in the beginning and the end of the book, and his stories are fun, funny, awkward and as raw as they get.<br />I can't recommend this book enough if you are planning on becoming a writer.<br />This book is doing something magical for me: it's making me enthused about becoming a better writer.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Originally I watched this at the theater and loved it, but when I played this 3D video on my new Samsung 3D- 55&#34; it really came alive and jumped out as one of the best love stories ever.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|this movie is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen in a long time, I have watched it multiple times and never get tired of it
B006LSZECO|1.0|I really wanted to like this book, but the ending was just terrible! The entire book was just unbelievable to me. However, it was suspenseful, which is about the only nice thing I can say about this book.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|phenomenal movie hugh jackman at his best. One of the best movies that has come out in a long time!
B000N3SSBM|5.0|Purchased as gift. Came as described, brand new in wrapper. I do love this movie and was happy I could give it to someone who loves it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've just had this game for a day, and it already is my favorite. The game is fast, fun, and easy to play, even for a 70 year old. The levels become more challenging the further along in the game.  Perfect for Kindle Fire users (any age).
0140135154|5.0|Needed this for a course on Critical Theory & Criticism but I wound up falling in love with the theories inside. Helped me write a final research paper and teach me more about art theory then I ever knew!
0761163808|2.0|works but does not hold kids attention for more than a minute seems like a total waste of money kids are bored with it
B0087GZ8YW|3.0|I enjoyed the book but found it not as good as previous Rebus novels of which I have read all,I feel Mr Rankin was looking for a vehicle too re- introduce Rebus,and that the plot was weaker than his previous books.however having said that it is good to see Rebus back.and long may he continue,but with stronger plots please.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I give this app 1 star because it's not compatible with with all tablets. It shows up inappropriate store saying compatible with all tablets.
B005HEQKDU|3.0|The sound track drags so bad that the music reminds me of an old 8 track tape that got wet.But the show is great
0307959856|3.0|Not a typical P.D. James book.  It's as if she's trying to write like Jane Austen, and it's fun to go back over the Pride and Prejudice story.  Reads slow, like Austen.  Without the gore and darkness of James.
B005LAIHHC|5.0|We love this movie, and we have watched it three times now and each time it has us cracking up many times.... it is current with the times and pokes fun at just about every type of person, nation, etc out there.....<br /><br />So, just relax, try to take it as it is...... it is funny really..... but if you are an orthodox die hard person protective of everything you do in life, then this is not a movie for you. So don't even watch it.... and don't give it a bad rating as it was never meant for you to watch!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|A wild ride.  So many villians and so few heros.  Every horror movie prototype seems to be represented.  Love the intro as well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Don't really care for sci-fi but this one caught my attention...and kept it until the end of the 5th book.  Now reading number 6.
0596805527|5.0|such fluid writing.one of the best computer books i've read. one of the things i thought was icing on the cake was that if something important from a different section is being referred to; there will be little references to the section.
1451695187|5.0|Excellent reading..Well written and beautifully explained as to what happens in a near death experience.<br />This book explains more clearly the process that may be experienced at death as we know it.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|This is a really good and fun when there is nothing else to do. Buy only if you enjoy puzzles with a passion
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am about half way through this book now, just finished the Gettysburg Address.  This is a long book but I have learned much about the period leading up to the civil war, my country, and politics in general.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I accidentally wrote this review under the wrong ID, but anyway, great book! Felt like I was reading a 6th grade level SF book but I love the Halo series and felt Mr. Eric did a great job fleshing out an background for Master Chief John 117
B009ERK1T0|5.0|After Diamond Eyes, Deftones keep this harmonic violence in Koi No Yokan. Lovely album from start to finnish. Most recommended trakcs: Tempest, Entombed, Leathers and Rosemary,
B007X4N0DU|4.0|when I first listened to this album, I almost felt disappointed in it as a whole. but after listening to the disc the whole way through a few times, my opinion changed. it almost sounded corny to me, but the album ended up growing on me. &#34;Bad Boy&#34; is a cute song in my opinion and ended up being one of my favorites. &#34;I Am&#34; became my second favorite, because I can relate to having some of the issues/flaws that Sonny mentions in the lyrics. I really am not a fan though of &#34;On Fire&#34; and usually always skip that song.<br />Overall, another great album from an awesome band!
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|I liked the story.  It was totally in keeping with the novel.  I would recommend it if you enjoy old movies.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Very compelling series.  Each episode leaves you hanging anxious to see the next one. There are so many mind blowing twist and turns! Superb acting!  Extremely well done!
B008V1IR4Q|5.0|This  is a magnificent tribute to one of the truly great pianists.  It is gratifying that HMV recorded so much.  I'm sorry the previous reviews are so sniggling.  What do they expect?  We are given matrices and dates of recording which are corroborated in the Cortot Biography.  In any case, I would think EMI would have the dates etc.<br />What can one say when presented with such an edition?  The breadth of Mr. Cortot's repertoire is staggering to say the least.  People with little emotional feeling will find some of this difficult and those who think note perfection is equated with greatness will not like this.  These people do not interest us.<br />If you are looking for the music and someing of a vanished era, this is for you.
B00275EHJG|5.0|When my kids saw the first movie fell in love, it was toy story all the way.  They just love Buzz and Woody.  So I bought it as they went on sale.  Am I tired of watching it? Heck yea!  Are they?  Heck no!  Now they are asking when is 4 coming out....
B004UIOUHC|3.0|got it hoping i could have another(better) option than using the silk browser on my kindle fire hd. but it doesnt work on my kindle.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|for some one who hates to facebook, but has to facebook to keep up with family it works pretty good. I dropped my rating from three stars to one because the app does not sink up to my Facebook settings and my news feeds are full of the crap games that i have blocked on my account. through my personal computer and the silk web browser on my kindle i don't see all that, why does having a little convenience of not having to go through a web browser override our settings. It took me forever to figure out how to get my account where the info i wanted to see overrode the crap.  The more frustrating Facebook gets the more i hate it.
B00150VWX8|4.0|What can I say? It's one of Wagner's most magnificent orchestral works without the vocals. The rendition is beautiful, the recording clean, my only wish is that it was a longer recording hence four stars instead of five.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best bible app ever, love that it even has bible versions that read it to you and my husband loves the czech and german versions.
B0030B1WBM|5.0|Rented this for one night to watch with my son, and he LOVED it!!<br /><br />We enjoyed this because it was easy to do with the Playstation. Way to go Amazon on making rentals simple, and thanks for fixing the video quality of it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|If you love flowers, you'll love this story.  Very interesting with an endearing character.  I learned a lot about the meaning of flowers, too.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|My last flash was from the 80's (SB-15 I think).  This thing blows it out of the water!  So many options, I may never fnow how to use them all.  When zooming, it is listed on the back screen, so it knows how to adjust the flash to widen or narrow the flash.  As powerful as I will ever need, and the bounce option; and the diffuser; will allow for all sorts of creative lighting effects.  I know my family will probably get fed up with all the pictures I will take this holiday season!  This is mounted on a D-7000 with MB-D11 Battery Pack.  Fairly heavy, but feels nice and solid.  I can deal with that, and the extra weight helps stabilize when taking pictures on the fly, especially of my fast moving grandaughter!  If you have had a current version of the Nikon Speedlights, you may not be overly impressed, but coming from an old one, it is amazing how the technology has increased.  I have not had an under of over exposed picture yet, even with a quick aim and focus.  Am VERY impressed!
B009LROCJI|5.0|Amazon.com requires at least 20 words in order to write a review for the product. However, what I want to write for this album is just one word: Marvellous!<br /><br />I've even felt more passion in this version than that of Vivaldi! It reminded me an imaginary \\"Mona Lisa Repainted\\" as contemporary art or even \\"Mona Lisa Reinstalled\\" as installation art.
0307155102|5.0|I bought it for my daughter's third birthday present. She is enjoying the illustrations as much as I did, this book will be around for awhile.
B0076DELIG|5.0|In this book in particular but in recent Harry Bosch stories, you can feel his dedication to his work in a political world of bean counters.  Mike Regan
0547884591|5.0|I ordered this book for the Coconut Sesame Chicken recipe, I didn't realize there was so much more between the covers. Including how to start my day with a protein power drink and how to safely chop food. Amazing to have so much info in one book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A very provocative tale.  Vince Flynn in this particular story hit the feelings of  present day America in regards to terrorism.  All Mitch Rapp needed was a cape.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's not a very good read. It fell short of what I expected. and the story line was not to my liking.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|The original movie remade several years ago as &#34;The Preacher's Wife&#34;, which is also excellent. Wonderful cast. Funny, touching, sweet...it just doesn't seem like Christmas at out house without it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun for anyone age 3 and up. Younger kids can enjoy driving the colors around the board while older (8 &amp; up) can solve the lower levels.
B008ENA74E|5.0|Boy, Did I learn a lot!  Extremely interesting and informative.  I hated to see this book end.  I appreciate Greg Smith writing it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Blah blah blah blah blah blah  blah blah blah blah :.  Good clean fun for all. From 5 to 40+, everyone in the house loves this game.

B009VB97EY|3.0|This was an entertaining film overall.  The most fun part was watching the guys dance.  The dance themes were creative and the men were good dancers.  The story line was OK but a little thin and there wasn't a lot of character development.  Overall it has entertainment value, especially if you don't want to think too much.
B0099TJ4YQ|3.0|I was disappointed to find that this is essentially the same album I'd bought at Hallmark a few years ago. However, it's great music, so I'll probably give it to someone who likes JT as much as I do.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|Brain Trainer Special Pro is a lot faster than I would have liked but I have only tried a couple of puzzles so far.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|his books are the best I hope to continue to hone my skills and come close to his expertise in suspense,  working on it with my second novel Have Another Round On Me

B0025KVLTC|5.0|Revolver is one of if not the best Beatles albums of all time.Every song is amazing. This album was when The Beatles really became a fantastic band.THe product itself is also great.Shipping was fast.CAme with a good Mini-Documentary on the CD that you can view on your computer.DEfinetly buy this CD!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I found this app for my wife who loves to take pic after pic of the kids and add effects to them.<br /><br />She said this app is one of her new favorites.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The best part is when I get money they go &#34;Cha Ching&#34;! It works great and keeps me abreast of what is going on with my account as it happens,
B004GJYROG|5.0|I am unsure of exactly how good this DVD is yet, as I have bought it for my 2 sons (age 7 & 9) for Christmas...They have yet to open and watch it! I do imagine that they will love it though...
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I downloaded this app for my son and he loves it.  It's a fun little game with a lot of fun activities for preschool age kids.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I recommend this book highly. Love the author's style -- he presents complex material in a witty and engaging manner. Liked it so much that I sent it off as Christmas presents to family and friends. I read it on my basic Kindle -- displayed perfectly, easy to read. A good book!
B006RXQDH8|5.0|What can I say more about Uma Thurman, the great music, and the amazing work done by Quentin Tarantino ?
B006LSZECO|3.0|In the end, the book leaves you satisfied: there is a twist, the story is well tied up and the character becomes likeable eventually. However, it is not a page-turner from the very start. I almost gave up the book after having read about a quarter of it, because the story looked flat and there wasn't really anything happening. On the whole, it is a solid thriller (although not very thrilling), better than lots of rubbish which lands in bestseller charts lately - but by far not the best book of the year, not even close.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Enjoyed the first 2 of the series. Even enjoyed the movie sort of. However (spoiler alert) the third book killing of characters that I connected with needlessly; and the never-endng &#34;mental illnesses&#34; of the remaining characters was a complete and total disappointment. It seemed like the author was searching for a way out, and chose a pathetic and mind numbing path. I should have been warned and just quit after the second book.<br /><br />I hope they don't continue with plans for a movie sequel, I will avoid it purposefully.
B004MOMT2M|5.0|Rush is simply the best.  If you could<br />get this in a paperback book edition, I would buy it<br />P.S. Please try :-)
B006LSZECO|5.0|If you like a story that keeps you on your toes - this is it! The point of view is from both main characters and the twists come one after another. I never saw any of it coming!  This is one of those stories you don't want to put down and can't wait to turn the page.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|No matter what medium you can get RUSH in, it will be great.<br />Old footage put in today's technology is all I have been waiting for.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Movie was funny, entertaining and broke up my trip. Great to download and watch on a plane. Better than the second one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was heartbreakly beautiful. The beginning of this book starts out so amazing. I just love Sky she is a great character and I was having a hard time seeing why she was detached from the guys she would hook up with . But since she didn't know I just assumed she just hadn't found the right one. I loved her neighbor Six, I wanted a little more of her cause she was just so entertaining. I loved Holder the minute he came into the picture. He was great and I really liked him a lot. And Breckin was also an awesome best friend to Sky.<br /><br />Through the first half of the book Sky and Holder were hilarious. They were so cute and I just loved everything about them. Then we get introduced to Sky's past and it is really really heartbreaking. It also affect Holder and that made me so sad and fearful for them.<br /><br />Sky is one of the strongest people and I am so glad she had Holder and her Mom to lean on. I know some of the subjects in this book are so hard to read about, and it hurts just reading about it, but it is also real. This like this do go on in the world and it is so sad. It was written so well. And this story will always stick with me. As much as my heart hurt reading this book. My heart also felt content when it ended because of everything that happened. I will always love Holder and Sky.<br /><br />And when I got to the part about what the name of the book really means it made this book mean that much more. Wonderful book. Colleen Hoover definitely NEVER disappoints. Wonderful Wonderful book!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I am a spider solitaire addict and this is one of the best apps that I have found. I definitely recommend downloading it
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a great page turner if you are the kind of reader who needs to be hooked in order to get through a book. The chapters alternate between being narrated by the husband and wife. You really don't know how its going to end. There's a lot of hidden humor about the realities of relationships and marriage. Sick humor, but honest. Very well written; finally a book by an actual writer.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|This is a well written show with good (not great) acting, but I have been very disappointed with Amazon's ability to consistently deliver the HD stream.<br /><br />I only gave this 4 stars because of the streaming problems. Otherwise, the show itself gets 5 stars. If I could, I would give it four and three-quarters stars, with Breaking Bad as the standard-bearer at five stars.<br /><br />On the other hand, I have had issues getting this to stream in HD and am very disappointed and frustrated with Amazon. I paid for HD quality and expect to receive just that, but, so far, that has not always been the case.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use facebook often and like how user friendly it is. I find it to be a great tool for conecting with family.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Took a few chapters to get me fully on board, but it devoped into a page-turning typical Clancy! I have read them all and enjoy the characters I have met. A scary scenario but believable.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This a simple tool for your e mails. I love it and reccommend this app to anyone interested in yahoo mail.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love the show but there is the occassional passionate love scene that can be a bit uncomfortable if watching with the little ones.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love the protection and the way the cover props up my kindle while watching videos! I reccomend this product.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I have all the others on dvd or instant, i would watch it all day if I could, cant get enough
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The weather channel is a useful tool, however I have a idea we wont use this app too much! Great for travelers and certain areas where weather is a big concern.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is my new favorite Christmas Album!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Blue Christmas has always been a favorite of mine and I think this is the best version yet!  I think the musical arrangements are superb and a perfect compliment to Rod Stewart's voice.  Red Suited Super Man is a wonderful song and the sax just makes it that much better.  I like every song on this CD, even those I normally skip on others, like Auld Lang Syne, I listen to them on this one.  The addition of When You Wish Upon a Star seemed odd at first, but now it just seems right.  LOVE IT!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|It's perfect for the camera and lens. However, it's too particular for camera. It's hard for me to put some other stuff inside, such as laptop and kindle, which I always need while traveling.
B007L7JY3Y|2.0|In order to be able save any tabs/tasks/projects/etc you have to continually rotate the screen on the KF for the save option to show up. If you want to add a note you can't because the save button is off the screen and therefore it can't be saved. This is an extremely irritating issue. The app makers know this (and have since the beginning of November) and will look into it at some point (they don't seem to care) according to their discussion forum. Time to find a different app and hopefully get my money back. If you only want to add task names with no notes, this may work for you.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|The DVD arrived much sooner than I anticipated. Movie shows with great film and sound quality. Disc was without scratches or issues and everything seemed brand new.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Moon is a great film and Sam Rockwell gives a great performance. I wont go into detail about the film because I dont want to spoil anything for you but just know that this film is a good buy. The blu-ray quality is awesome as well with great picture and sound. If your a fan of science fiction or good movies in general you will not be disappointed.
1400064287|5.0|This book will tell you everything you need to know in order to communicate effectively.  The writing is terrific and fun!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Nothing to go on about but beats a lot of them out there. And even the music isn't as annoying as most. Lol
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I was excited to watch this given how amazing the last one was.  Also, I'm a big fan of Tom Hardy so I was excited that he portrayed the villain (to say nothing of Gray Oldman's prowess).  Unfortunately, it fell flat.  Too much was included and as a result the movie moved much too quickly from scene to scene.  Overall, a disappointment.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Funnier than I expected.  What could have been stupid was diverted with funny albeit raunchy humor. Seth McFarland is brilliant
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have had so much fun on this game and I will never get tired of it. it is very fun and addicing
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Vintage Clancy.  Good plot and plenty of situations that get you thinking about what might really happen in the real workd.  Would have given it 5 stars but how many times can Jack Ryan save the world.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very fast shipping and product  as described.  Will shop with them again in the future.<br />Thank you very much.<br />:)
B007704HO6|5.0|a wonderful story , have recommeded it to my daughters for christmas reading. cats are amazing animals and very intelligent,and intuitive.
B000L9EKL0|5.0|This movie was exceptional. I am grateful to Amazon that i could have viewed it here. Would watch it again with the same excitement
B009HEJXFS|2.0|While Josh Brolin does a fantactic job of playing the young agent K, MIB3 is just not nearly as good as the last 2. The story is weaker and does not hold up. I wanted to like it as I think the other 2 movies in the series are great, it was just a let down.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Josh Brolin nails the K's younger character!  Spot on!  This is the third in the series and as most sequels go, it's not the best, but you will be very entertained.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Good action-good acting-moves a little slowly in some episodes but overall a good series!  Will purchase 2nd season soon!!  Also 3rd season!!
B009KHBDUU|3.0|The acting is very good in this film, but keep the kids under 13 out of the room!  We made the mistake of watching as a family and my 11 and 8 year olds were very frightened.  It has funny parts, but it is more scary than you would think.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I didn't think they could come up with a decent Thor, but they did, backed by Patrick Doyle's excellent score.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Will Ferrell delivers an adorable performance, while Zooey Deschanel is just the right blend of jaded and hopeful. A modern classic!
1401307787|4.0|recommended by my doctor, I read it everyday like the bible or something!  Very helpful in learning that your thoughts and emotions are not reality, they are just your thoughts and emotions.  Learning to observe and be nonjudgemental about my own thoughts and feelings, learning stillness and calmness, not always trying to change my thoughts and feelings, just observe them and learn from them, recommend this book for those of you who need some peace in their lives
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved The Art of Racing in the Rain.  I laughed and cried at the same time at the end.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This package is well thought out and convenient.  Video and audio are good.  I'm not going to extreme detail on this when others seem to be able to pick apart every technical point with a comparative  analysis.  I read the reviews before buying this.  Most are glowing.  In my opinion they are correct.  Very well done.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Quick, easy read and laughed out loud multiple times. Read this book over 1 afternoon.  Tina Fey's self deprecation was amusing.
B009ZQGNPQ|4.0|Im on episode 6 of season 3 and its great!!! They really have the character Matthew Crawley stepping up. Its great to see Lady Crawleys love for her husband despite.................
B00004R99F|5.0|I grew up watching this movie and I still love watching it to this day. My favorite scenes have to be Lester's Possum Park and the Powerline concert at the end.
B008Y7J1Y2|5.0|Trading houses and lives for a few days can sound wonderful for anyone in a stressful life and especially when you suddenly realize you are going to be spending the Holidays alone.  It's wonderful to be able to see how being in a different place with different people (even if for a short time) can totally change your life forever.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Wow, I had high hopes for this movie and it was so bad I stopped watching it 1/2 way through the movie.  The writing is so hard to understand, it seems it was written as art or a poem something that might make a good read but a terrible movie.  I watch new movies to get an escape and for entertainment, not to have to sit and think about every word that is said.<br /><br />Terrible movie!
B005DOJ68K|5.0|IT'S GREAT,LIKE IT SAYS &#34; 20 GREATEST HITS&#34;  WHAT MORE CAN I SAY.I'M 72 & I LOVE THIS MUSIC.ONE, TWO
B006CQLGXG|4.0|I had seen various movie versions, and  knew the story well.  However it was fun just to read Dickens original .
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Once again Ian Rankin has truned out and excellent novel. It was great to read about old Rebus getting up to his old tricks. I hope he managed to get back into the CID and we can have some more fun reading about his unorthodox antics.
B004UID2LC|2.0|it comes up but  won't play, I push the arrow and it brings up a menu and won't play.  don't work like android
B006H5120E|5.0|So today I cracked the seal on what was an special treat to watch on my new 3DTV. I have to add that since I first saw Beowulf in 3D, I have become a fan of these movies in theaters but I missed Titanic after watching the blu-ray I wished I hadn't missed it in the cinema. The color, the picture quality, the incredible sound transfer is immaculate, so just watching this in blu-ray would be a treat, a movie that demanded Hi-Def treatment. I know James Cameron was very involved in the process of creating the 3D conversion and it shows,from the smallest vase at the edge of your screen to the grand staircase, to the engine room, you are drawn inward, immersed, you are a passenger. The effect was not so much to put things in your face like some gimmicky 3D films but to bring you aboard, make you a participant in what could be a modern day Romeo & Juliet, Tragedy of Epic porportions. I admit I saw this film 3 times when it first appeared in theaters but never once did I purchase the dvd and often skipped it on television so watching it again was a fresh trip back. I with all honesty and I don't like to get into all the technical jargon, you simply must experience Titanic 3D you will be taken away, you will walk the halls, climb the stairs, you will hang by the rails of the ship, stand behind Rose on the bow of the ship with her hands extended to the wind. Titanic 3D is a Dazzling Achievement of what can be done with loving care to detail in a 3D conversion and I would expect no less from the Maestro James Cameron.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I love being able to rotate the kinds in this case, and I love that this is real leather. There are a lot of plastic cases out there. Leather is far more durable, nice to the touch, and provides some nice padding.<br /><br />I like this case, it looks very nice. I also feel like it provides good protection for the Kindle. Leather is water resistant, so it will protect your kindle from casual splashes.<br /><br />The rotation feature is great. I had another case, which also acted as a stand, but only in landscape. This is fine for movies, but for books I find portrait mode is easier.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This wonderful Dickens classic is great to read on Kindle with its illustrations.  I try to read CHRISTMAS CAROL each holiday season.  Reading it on Kindle is a new experience and a fabulous value for a buck.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I have to admit, after the October 31st episode aired, I was afraid they were throwing yet another horror story cliche at me (zombies) to go with demonic possession, aliens, psychotic killer, creepy mad scientist/doctor, creepy nun, etc. and I threw my hands up and decided zombies were the last straw (I have no interest in the zombie genre). But friends told me to come back into the fold, that the poor creatures in the woods surrounding the asylum were not, in fact, zombies, but something... different. So, I got on Amazon last week and watched all the episodes I had missed since October 31st. What can I say... I am enjoying the craziness, the eeriness, the edge-of-my-seat, sitting-and-watching-through-my-fingers nervousness, and I am sympathizing with characters and cringing at others, and hoping some get their comeuppance - I'm in for the long haul. I am enjoying it as much as I did the first season. Bring it on, AHS, I'll be watching. Scared and squirmy, but watching.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Brown paper packages tied up with string.<br /><br />Classic musicals with songs that make me smile.<br /><br />These are a few of my favorite things....
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Mature adults have no business laughing--uncontrollably in some instances--at scatalogical humor, high school hijinks or boorish behavior.  That's why I'm glad I watched &#34;Ted&#34; at home. Yep, Ted's libido is large, his intelligence tiny (although probably huge among his stuffed bear colleagues) and he has absolutely no sense of political correctness. This is a very funny movie, slowed only by the humans in Ted's life who keep making the same relationship mistakes. Watch it, without the kids, but don't say I told you to.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Seriously one of the best movies of the year (right after End of Watch).  I highly recommend viewing it even if you just rent it.  Similar titles: Bridesmaids, Mean Girls, What to Expect When You're Expecting, Easy A
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Bought this the first time for my son, I am now buying as many of bonamsa's dvds as are published, Listen to this one time and you are hooked by his love of music & his dexterity. Very, very good.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Both my girls ages 10 & 8 love this game. They have become very creative with the use of mind craft.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Best Sherlock Holmes reincarnation in years! We are enjoying every episode immensely. Lucy Liu is a wonderful Watson. We hope this series lasts a while.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bought this for my Sweetie as a present, but I'm eager to put it on my iphone as soon as she opens it.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|A fascinating journey into the mind of a brilliant autistic child or a &#34;savant&#34;.  Twists and turns keep you turning the pages.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My 8 year old plays it all the time, ran the battery down twice. She said 5 stars but I'll give it a 4.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|another great game from g5. always original and fun. very interesting and lots of intrigue. keep the great games coming.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am recommending this series to all my friends.  The story is timeless.  Masterpiece did an excellent job with the production.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I went to check the weather and it didn't update! it also said it was going to be 254 degrees today!! what in the world is up with that!! it worked perfectly fine until that happened. I also got 135 degrees and 215. I do not understand.
1451629184|5.0|I could not put this book down although there were places in it that made me cry, but it is very detailed and heart rendering.. Most of all she donated the money from this book to help children that are molested..
B000SEIK2S|3.0|But too short! Scalzi IS always fun to read but I do prefer books that take more than an hour to read...
0525953728|5.0|I ordered this book from Amazon. com, and I enjoyed it so  much that it was hard for me to put down.  I found it to be an interesting read.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This is an intriguing story.  While many of us know generally about the time period and the social mores of the age, this book provides incredible insight and detail and puts the reader 'right there'.  It is difficult to put this book down!  Heartily recommend it.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|A well written book that is hard to put down. I can't wait to read the next book to see what happens.  There are some characters that I really couldn't get enough of and others that I really didn't want to read any more of. I don't normally read this type of book but have to say I am hooked.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I say this concert in Korea and what a musical journey it is.  It should be called 68:10 as that is how long the piece is..<br />Such greatness.
B001EBV0IA|5.0|this has always been one of our favorites.we seem to watch it a few times every year.you won't be sorry.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|easy to use and very accurate. teenage daughter loves to use it to see who sings the new song she likes.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|An ordinary thriller with a weak story,Free violence and superman ideology.I am sure that its great success,this kind of book sell well
B001706I5I|5.0|One of the best family Christmas movies today!  The kids loved it, and so did the adults.  It was funny and sweet.
B004X4R49Y|4.0|My wife brow beat me into watching this.  Her tactics were perfect.  She persuaded me to watch The Queen.  She then said the prequel was The King's Speech.  Finally I relented and watched Colin Firth in The King's Speech.  Both movies were treasurers.  My confession, I married above my station.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|My step-daughter chose the movie for family night, and I will have to admit, I wasn't excited about watching this.  However, this movie was surprisingly entertaining.  I even cried a little.  Great family night movie!
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Forget the plot; ignore the scenery, costumes, and photography; just watch Helen Mirren.  Her acting is worth the movie; however, I did enjoy the plot, scenery, etc.
0307591549|5.0|This is a fantastic book, I heard him speak in person and he is a great speaker as well as a fantastic author
1451695195|1.0|Let me begin by saying that I am not a materialistic reductionist when it comes to the mystery of life - and death.  After years of independent research and conversations with those who have experienced the metaphysical, I lean towards believing that consciousness is not produced by the material brain, but rather consciousness somehow and for whatever ultimate reason actually creates the brain.<br /><br />Carl Sagan once said something to the effect that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proofs.  If that is so, then Dr. Eben Alexander's book is fallaciously titled.  There is no truly verifiable \\"proof of heaven\\" to be found within the pages of this  book.  It is, in truth, way too brief a book for its presumed intent to explain God and eternity and the purpose of earthly existence.  Rather than deeply and seriously analyzing both the medical condition that led to Dr. Alexander's encounter with the Girl on the Butterfly Wing who took him from the Realm of the Earthworm's-Eye View to the Gateway and onward to the Core (these all sound like names intended for the film that may one day be made)and the encounters themselves, we learn more about the good doctor's family life and how to parachute in group formation out of a plane than we do about the eternal verities.<br /><br />Actually, in reading of the Girl on the Butterfly Wing I kept thinking of the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and realized that I wasn't so much reading a scholarly, studious, serious book at all - but more so a blueprint for a future film!  The more often than not two or three page chapters that jump-cut between life on earth and the doctor in a coma with his family gathered near and the fantastic flights on the Butterfly Wing and the encounters with God - or rather Om - truly made me me think I was reading a wannabe script rather than a scholarly work of sincere revelation.<br /><br />Questions loom:  where is there one scintilla of corroborative evidence that the coma ever actually occurred?  Other than one testimonial from a Dr. Scott Wade - Dr. Alexander's neighbor and friend and main doctor - where are the voices of the other doctors and physicians to attest to the miraculous recovery of Dr. Alexander from his purported seven day coma due to his E. coli infection?  Despite his Appendix dismissing all other explanations for his mystical experiences, there is still the possibility that everything he allegedly went through on his spiritual flight may have happened before the supposed neocortex was damaged by the E.coli bacteria.  And this raises a larger issue: what is the medical evidence that the neocortex was as damaged as the doctor wants us to believe - or if it was truly damaged at all?  Most tellingly, even Dr. Alexander admits to his own doubts as to the veracity of his experience - until, that is, the final chapter!  SPOILER ALERT!  This final chapter with the surfacing of the \\"smoking gun\\" is straight out of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  It really is.  And it will make a heck of an ending to the possible movie to be made!  And given the slimness of this book, why couldn't this one soul-altering photograph have at least been included in the book itself?  The bottom line is that after reading this book there are many more questions than answers.<br /><br />Sadly, anyone can google the Malpractice, Reprimand, Sanction and Penalty history of Dr. Eben Alexander.  What I easily found isn't pretty.  Wrong site surgery, disciplinary actions, sanctions - and much of this in the years immediately prior to the good doctor's taking ill.  With monetary settlements and penalties looming in 2007 and the doctor supposedly in his coma in late 2008, is it conceivable that the experiences related in the book under review were more the confabulations of one seeking to escape possible financial ruin?  Who knows?  Anything is possible: Heaven, Hell and even medical, Mammon-motivated mendaciousness.  All I know is that Heaven sells - and there is earthly, tangible gold tobe found in them thar hills!be found in them thar hills!
B008KE3960|5.0|Great game, the only advice I would give is that it seems the higher level planes are almost not worth the effort, I would like to see the Wolf be a true terror so to speak.
B001OR0AEY|5.0|This is a must-see for any world-music lover. I found the beginning a little confusing, as the perspective shifted back and forth from a concert in Amsterdam to the streets of Havana, but once I realized what was happening, I was hooked. Absolutely recommend.
B0085YNML2|5.0|Pretty fun, and the latter levels are somewhat challenging.  I would recommend it.  This word limit requirement is stupid. Refrigerator!
B000HF0ILY|5.0|Sort of different take on the concept behind &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34;.  Michael Moriarty leads a good supporting cast. If you like Clint Eastwood westerns, this is one of the best.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|Blade Runner is simply a classic movie from director Ridley Scott.  The movie is about a the main character played by Harrison Ford who tracks down androids or skin jobs and terminates them.  The movie may not have the special effects of today's movies, but the movie is still looks very real, with a very believable story.  I would recommend this as a gift to any fan of science fiction movies.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I must say that this book was on many BEST OF 2012 lists. I have mixed feelings about that: sometimes, when everyone says something is the best, I sort of scratch my head and wonder about all the fuss. However, I bought the book, because I was so curious.<br />I enjoyed the book. Unfortunately, I read before I go to bed, and I typically made it through 3 pages each night (but, it went with me EVERYWHERE and I read it every free 5 minutes that I had). To be honest, this morning, I took ONE HOUR and sat down to finish the book.<br /><br />The book is broken down into 3 sections. First section: good, but I kept wondering why everyone said it was so amazing: it was good.<br />Second section: AMAZING. I could not read fast enough. Third section: NOT satisfying. I did not expect \\"happily ever after\\" but I did NOT exptect the ending I got.<br /><br />Nick and Amy (as a couple)are rather pathetic, but maybe the evoulution of their relationship is pretty normal. As the book went on, you knew that Amy was brilliant, but SICK. Nick became pretty brilliant. Amy's parents: selfish and out of touch. The dectectives: they were lackluster and not very focused. The lawyer that Nick hired reminded me Tommy Jefferson, from Harry's Law.He was great.<br /><br />So, buy this book: worth the time and money. I want to read her other books!!!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Ellie Goulding's album is by far the best new album of the year. All the songs on her new album are fun to listen too. She mixes just the right amount of up beat tempo, and slow thoughtful songs to make this an amazing album. Her voice and range are outstanding and is truly a pleasure to listen too.
B0043U7XJO|5.0|I love Robin Hood, this by far is now one of my favorite movies.  Russell Crowe does a great job.
B009A3NGF4|3.0|This isn't nearly as good as their first album and left me feeling like there was a little something to be desired. It's not bad but it is also not what I was expecting.
B0091V6TF4|2.0|First and foremost congrats on 50 pretty amazing years and best wishes for 50 more; and score-wise, Thomas Newman and/or David Arnold should keep things moderately interesting.  Adele also added some life to the Bond vocals this year and one hopes it is a sign of things to come.  \\"The Best of Bond\\" is only partially truthful in this latest compilation.  It does contain all of the main themes (except \\"Skyfall\\"), vocal and otherwise, on Disc One and for the most part this does represent \\"the best.\\"  But, truth be told, some of the recent vocals have not really measured up and Adele's \\"Skyfall\\" is not on this collection or the soundtrack album...too bad, because it is good stuff.  The assembled cuts on Disc Two are certainly representative of the past 50 years but are hardly \\"the best.\\"  There is nothing really new or exciting here, and not enough of John Barry and too much of some composers that barely measured up.  This is especially sad given that this is the 50th anniversary of 007, James Bond.  This could have been a very exciting and desired collection, but instead it is really only memorable for some of the older songs, a very few  good orchestral cuts and some interesting artwork.  Note that this would have been the perfect opportunity to produce some unreleased music by Barry who just recently passed away.  All in all a missed chance that will not come again for another 50 years.
1603427244|4.0|I am an experienced knitter and tend to use the same stitches for every beginning and completing projects, so this is an excellent reference manual to remind me of useful and often more creative options for beginning and finishing my work.  I find the explanations and drawings easy to understand and to follow (perhaps because I have more experience?) and I especially like the spiral binding and the size as they make this book incredibly easy to use. A &#34;must-have&#34; for me!
B00371XIJE|5.0|If you are a dog lover, you'll love it. Based on a true story. A great movie to watch with whole family.
141659521X|5.0|I love spy books and vince flynn is the best. There is no better character than mitch rapp.i recomend the entire mitch rapp series. Also flynns' first book \\"term limits\\" is excellent.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids love challenging their minds with this one. They just love it. We will deffently be suggesting this to our friends.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Had to get this movie.  Saw it in the theater it is wonderful.  Recommend for anyone over 40, life changing!!!
B007EC27QM|3.0|It's about as basic a calculator as you can get.  It works okay but has no square, square root, inverse, or other common functions.  If all you're wanting to do is basic addition, subtraction, etc., it's okay but I would suggest looking for something a littl;e more.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  Sheldon is just the best.  There is something to be said for having that innocent, unaware person in your life---or, is it you.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a power cord that does what is supposed to do. Not really much else I can say about it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|If nothing else, reading this story has given me motivation to go back out and try running again. I am by no means a \\"runner\\" but after 58 years my joints hurt so much after running I've given it up. I found the book very well written and couldn't put it down, learning about a group of people I'd never heard of, a life style I'd never known of and a community of ultra-runners I marvel at. I was sad having to read the last page.
B008N1V11U|5.0|My son is a video game and Batman fanatic. This game fits in perfectly with his taste. I like it because it is portable and he is able to play it in the car. A little dark - so probably not for the younger crowd. But I really like it.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|This movie looked pretty stupid and it lived up to my expectations. That being said it is still pretty funny and worth watching.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I viewed this movie on my Kindle Fire (using my Boise headphones) during a 5 hour flight from Orlando to California. I downloaded the move, before I left the hotel, and enjoyed the movies light humor and entertainment, with no interruptions from the passenger seated next to me.
1451695195|5.0|The best book I have read about near death!  I would recommend this book to anyone.  I have given Proof of Heaven to three family members, it is a great gift!  Libby smith
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Loved the movie from beginning to end. It leaves you hanging waiting for the next chapter. Awesome action scenes and a very strong story line.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I have finished this series, and can honestly say that it's a must read for anyone that enjoys fantasy. The magic system is a breath of fresh air from the cookie cutter magic systems of other series. Gone are the days of someone being more powerful just because they were born that way.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! Just made my 16 year old watch it with me and she loved it too!! Classic :)
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I have finished this series, and can honestly say that it's a must read for anyone that enjoys fantasy.

B009HSVHV2|5.0|I like the song and it is way much better than the old version apparently this at the last track is littlests screwed. Up but and al the track to 10 through I give it a 5 out of 5
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I've already reviewed book 2 prior to this review. Suffice it to say though, this is a must read. If you enjoy fantasy, hardship struggles, and want a &#34;hero&#34; you can relate to, this is a series for you.
B0067RQYNW|2.0|I like to write books, and between work and school I figured that I could write on my kindle. By using this app I have lost 2 books files and I need to rewrite them. This app doesn't handle the documents you make well, even if you save them. Both of the documents I lost had been deleted automatically. Not recommended for usage over long periods of time. Not to mention the laggage and how long it takes to open.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I have finished this series, and can honestly say that it's a must read for anyone that enjoys fantasy. The magic system is a breath of fresh air from the cookie cutter magic systems of other series. Gone are the days of someone being more powerful just because they were born that way.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Good game but graphics look bad on modern Android phones like Nexus 4 (768x1280 screen).<br />Also this version has less features and bonus games than iOS version.<br />If you have iOS device - buy this game from Apple App Store.
B002VHI8FE|1.0|There is almost nothing worse than having to read aloud noises that people make in action......ie. &#34;erm......er......eh&#34; or when some gets hit &#34;oooooof&#34;. I find it very annoying, and hardly readable.
B002EDH0FE|5.0|Very different, quirky superhero movie. A thinking person's comic adaptation. Special effects were cool, too. Beautiful cinematography. Loved the ordinariness of the superheros; powerful, but flawed. Each unique and distinct, with their own opinions, dreams and fears; not black and white, but mixed, like real people. Loved how each of their back stories trickled out. The &#34;comic book&#34; style violence could be disturbing for some. Loved how they used speed ramping techniques to highlight key action like a comic book frame. Recommended.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I really can't wait for the third book. Our &#34;hero&#34; is so very human and flawed you can't help but love him. Very very well written, and fits into my &#34;must read&#34; list for fantasy lovers.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|I normally only download free games for the grandchildren but my granddaughter asked me if I would buy this one for her.  She loves it!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I genuinely believe that this series, after just reading book 1,  will go down as on of the greatest all time.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|If I were only reviewing the movie, I would give it 5 stars without a doubt.  I'm giving it 4 because the quality of the HD movie stream was decent, but not like a top-notch blu-ray.  There were lots of scenes with smoke or clouds where there was very obvious aliasing.  For the most part, the action scenes were smooth and the picture was good, but it wasn't perfect.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Everyone I have introduced to this game has ended up buying it for themselves. It is entertaining and complex enough to remain fun without requiring a 45 minute tutorial before you can play it. My only complain about settlers is that you need at least three people to play.
B005K17RU0|5.0|No problems.  Intuitive.  Sufficient.  Brilliant.<br /><br />I haven't even bothered to look at any others, because this app is just so dag Babbitt good.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|This is a cool twist on history, Abe Lincoln vs vampires. I had a lot of fun with this movie. I wish I had seen it in the theater.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Wonderful game, but very addictive.  Many goals to attain which then progess you to the next level which has more goals.  Very time consuming in that you need to check back frequently, but you don't have to play for an extended period at any one time, unless you want to.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This was better than the first even thoug Jet Li was only in it for a short time. They brought in Chuck Norris and he rocked the movie...
B0063IH60K|4.0|The colors and crisp numbers are good for these old eyes.  The game moves quickly which wards off boredom.  I like the classic feel.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Definitely not for kids, but I laughed unitl my face and sides were sore.  Yes it was rude and crude but had a really good story underneath.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|How do you put into words how much you connect or love a book when you're not a writer?  I wish Colleen Hoover could come to my house and use her magic to help me write the review this book needs.<br /><br />It is a simple story of love between two people who are just start to date, but for them this becomes so much more. The building of this storyline keeps you on the sofa reading.  I didn't want to do anything because you get so lost in Sky and Holder that you forget these people don't really exsist.  I love Colleen Hoover's characters, just like Slammed and Point of retreat I felt so connected I wanted to call them for coffee.  It's the layering of words and realism that makes her characters feel like friends.<br /><br />This story made me cry, laugh and want to hug people. Give yourself a treat and spend a weekend reading all of Colleen Hoover's books.
B0034DGPEU|1.0|Our Book Club recently read this book - not one of us liked it.  Thought it was based too much on The Help - which was a far better written book.  Nothing new to be learned here - wicked overseer, horrible treatment of Blacks - incest between families, etc.
B009S33I68|4.0|One of the best true stories of American men and boys fighting to survive in a very difficult battle..  The American public needs to understand what our military went through during the early stages of the Vietnam war.
B007N85POS|5.0|It is a challenging game, fun for me and my grandchildren.  Helps pass the time although sometimes it can be quite frustrating.  overall I love it.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|I like twilight series, eclipse is a story builder.<br />good price and quality, good service.<br />fans get your collection started
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|i totally enjoyed this game...great story line and graphics.  puzzling enough but not too hard.  the hints are subtle and just point in the right direction without giving it all away.  hope to see more like this.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Yet another gripping tale set in the universe of the First Law Trilogy. One of my favorite things about J.A. Is that his stories have a gritty reality. The heroes are usually villains as well or near enough as makes no difference. It's all about perspective. \\"you have to be realistic...\\"
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I ordered this to go with the Amazon PowerFast charger. It fits both my Kindle Fire AND my older Kindle. I now use it in my travel bag as my &#34;go-to&#34; cable when traveling.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Well done but I fear similar scenario will happen again.  More scary than Obama 2016 because it's based on what has actually happened and will probably happen again.
B00633W614|5.0|This book was another wonderfully written book by Jeffrey Archer.  Can't wait for the 3rd book in the Clifton Chronicles series to be published!
B007DQ3G9G|4.0|I was surprised at the difference between the displayed and finished product and the actual one. These blocks are TINY and sometimes hard to put together. I really do not think they are for small children due to the possibility of such small (and I mean SMALL) pieces in the box. Legos can be pricey, if you do not hunt around and compare different sellers. I try to use online coupon or promo codes while buying. I also find that any Lego set with the \\"people\\" in them are more expensive than the others. Amazon offers sets of Lego people that can be purchased separately from the building block sets. I got a set of \\"Legoites\\" just to add diversity to the learning and playing experience. The lack of a board in the set upon which to place or lock the pieces into was unexpected. Also, they will easily fall apart while handling...so a little glue, varnish, or clear nail polish help there! Just look out for these things and enjoy your Legos!<br /><br />I find the themes of the various sets interesting and artful; however, I still have a problem with the extremely small parts and the number of them requires to put together the themes. Packaging was appropriate and delivery was quick, as always with Amazon.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|The app itself is great. It's trying to get support or techical support that is a joke. Downloading the app to a new phone is a hassle and takes forever to find information from DataViz.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This is a wonderful cd.  Voice is beautiful, songs are great.  it's hard to believe that this is an old recording.
B0026ICAOS|4.0|Children of the Corn is a 1984 horror movie based on a Stephen King story of the same name. In the town of Gatlin, Nebraska, life is going on as normal one Sunday morning. The adults in town have just gotten out of church while all but two children are in the local cornfields with a mysterious boy named Isaac, whom the one kid's father doesn't like or trust.<br /><br />After services end, the children with Isaac begin their attacks and suddenly murder every one of the adults in the town. Three years later, Isaac and the town's kids have continued living their isolated existence when a dating couple, played by Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton, stumble (or should I say 'drive') across a teenager who, like the other two kids not in the field that day, knew the evils in Gatlin had tried escaping but was caught and murdered.<br /><br />This leads the couple into town where the kids under Isaac's leadership decide to bring them and sacrifice them to their god, known only as He Who Walks Behind The Rows. The couple must now protect the two kids on their side as well as bring an end to the murdering child cult.<br /><br />CotC is what I think to be one of the better made Stephen King adaptions. The movie is an entertaining horror movie in its own right as well. As for the actual blu-ray itself, I have no complaints there. It looks nice enough. So far I've only used one of the special features, the function where trivia pops up on screen and every once in a while. It does give some nice background on different scenes.<br /><br />Is it worth a buy? If you don't already own it on DVD, then I would say yes. If you do own it on DVD already, then you'll have to decide for yourself if the special features make it worth it enough.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I play this cd all the time.  Love the fact that you can actually understand the lyrics and that they actually mean something!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The plot is great - almost perfect. I love how the book starts with a tense scene and then flashes back 2 months - it creates a lot of suspense and the build-up is handled really well.<br /><br />However, the book - in my opinion - starts reading as a bad self-help book halfway in ( feel the love, feel the hate..but let the blame go). The lead characters suddenly start speaking as if they have been in therapy for the better part of 20 years and all the drama turns into melodrama. This is extra annoying, because the dialogue up to that point is all kinds of great and the plot working so well.<br /><br />All in all I like (almost 'live') the book, I found it very affecting..it had such an effect... or is it affect?.. effecting? Hmm, those words are so difficult to figure out as proven in this book. The author should really get a(nother?) copy editor or proof reader - might be expensive but I'm sure we would all have paid an extra dollar for the book - the book is more than good enough to deserve better editing.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|The Bourne Legacy is a good movie, in and of itself.  I'm not completely sold on it as part of the Bourne Triology, but I've heard rumors that the follow-up will include both Jeremy Renner and Matt Damon.  So we'll see.  I'd say it's definitely worth watching.
B002AS463W|3.0|It's an OK movie. I probably wouldn't watch it again.  Seemed disjointed to me. I don't think that this was Basinger's finest hour.
B000026258|5.0|Today I had one of those moments of discovery. I was watching Amazon's video interview of Michael Chabon, on the page for Telegraph Avenue , the marvelous book which I just started a couple of days ago. One of the questions asked was what music he listens to when working, and he said this. I had never heard it before, but have been looking for something to listen to while grading this enormous stack of Hamlet essays sitting on my desk (I am a high school English teacher). I said, \\"why not?, downloaded this CD and am utterly thrilled by it. Just incredible. Chabon says he's listened to this thousands of times. I just finished my first. There'll be a lot more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There is just so much to this book. I loved all of the twists and turns. I had to stay up late to finish this book, I needed to know what happens, but once I was done, I wanted more.I have been consumed thinking about Holder and Sky since I finished the book. That rarely happens to me. I love Ms. Hoover's writing, and I will be reading anything and everything she publishes!
B000003CKH|5.0|Great album,<br />love the covers &<br />some of the stuff I've<br />never heard before. Went out<br />to get Comfort Eagle too. &#60;3 love<br />this!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Different than on my computer, yet easy to navigate.  Now I have all my idea pins wherever I go and in a format large enough to see.
B0083B3KOQ|3.0|Does a great job of converting files but is so very slow that if you have alot you might look for a different program.
B0085YNML2|5.0|Very fun and challenging game - super nice that it was the free game of the day.  It is easy to understand and begin playing.  Cute sounds and graphics; a very novel idea.  The only problem I have with it is there are times you get stuck and there are no hints; maybe this is part of the challenge.  Overall, very nice!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this game! I have been a ninjakiwi fan for years. There should be a way to save the game and play from the saved point
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is huge. Uses the whole page with large numbers and buttons so it is easy to use. Does what you need it to.
1423140605|5.0|The best book of the saga, I loved you, now I have to wait for the next! &#62;. &#60;But the cover is wonderful, a velvety texture .. Loved the book ... Completely surround with suspense, romance and high adventure! Percabeth forever!
B002MG2ATY|5.0|If you are into the intrigue that surrounds the Kennedy assination you will certainly be able to appreciate this movie. It delves into so many of the unanswered questions.This movie is one that you will want to watch when you have the time to really pay attention to it. Although noone will ever be able to give the exact account of what truly transpired when Kennedy was killed this movie gives a reasonable explanation to make anybody stop and think about it. It shows just how intricate a plot like this, and the amount of people involved, to pull this off. This movie is actually scary when you think about it.
1423136802|5.0|I love this history and loved the box! And this is in recycled paper, cheaper and help the world! Thanks again!
B005P5TQPU|3.0|I am a huge fan of Supernatural. Season 7 though was a bit of a disappointment. If you like Supernatural I would definately reccomend seeing it. I myself just did not like the story line, while others love it. Reviewing this season is just personal preferance.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is a must for anyone in a relationship.  It's a short and easy read that will definitely bring some light into your relationship.
B004YXE438|5.0|I love this app. Beautifully colored puzzles. Each puzzle has 4 different puzzle sizes, amount of pieces, to choose from along with 3 different difficulty settings. So the same puzzle has several variations to it. Can easily be set up for your kids and the same puzzle with the variation changed for yourself and for others. I'd say this is a wonderful game for everyone. Try the free app first. If you like it then you will love this one. It also has two extension packs you can purchase, which adds hundreds of more variations. I wish there were more extension packs, I really cannot get enough of this one.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|One of the best books ive ever read.  Written very well you find yourself right in the middle of this world
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app gives you access to all your Yahoo Mail. I use it when I want a quick look at my mail for important messages when I'm not at home or I dont want to actually go on the computer. The Kindle app is the same as the android mobile app.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|This is the best version of Jane Eyre that I have seen. I bought this as a present for a friend, we loved it so much.
B00377E5SG|5.0|i like both the boggy & ford versions.  they're nice to re watch from time to time.  makes me feel good.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I can't remember when I've enjoyed a book more. As soon as I finished I started from the beginning again and find there's plenty to savor in a second reading. In these dark times this book is a ray of optimism celebrating reinvention and imagination. Plus wonderfully memorable characters and places , and a plot that keeps you turning the pages. Just great!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|People are griping about Apple changing their power adapters... that doesn't warrant fewer stars.<br /><br />The converter works as advertised. It magnetically attaches to my old MagSafes (2 different voltages, from my 2010 MBP and a 2008 MB) and then latches onto my 2012 MBA with ease. After a month or so, it was starting to be a bit flimsy and finicky. I looked at the converter and it was fine, however there was some dust/lint in the port on the laptop end. Cleaned it out with a toothpick and everything was good again.<br /><br />I paid less than $5, and it was definitely worth it. Even at $10, its cheaper than buying an entirely new power adapter.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Charming, disjointed, but full of characters that are quirky and amusing.  Different from the movie, but not much.  Fun and easy to read.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|It you are intrigued by the title, or in the mood for some unserious fun, look no further. This movie plays its one joke well, plays it with a straight face, and has the nerve to play with a sensitive subject or two. Better still the movie rewards people who know a little more about Abraham's circle of friends and advisors. All in all, a fun little film.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app I use it instead of the one that came preloaded on my phone.  I will definitely recommend it to all my friends
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works well, no problems. You gotta try it. it does exactly what an alarm clock is supposed to do and it offers snooze options.
B0026O475M|4.0|A must see if you have never seen it, but once you have been through it, once is enough!!!  Tom Hanks is always believable in everything he does.
0385535139|5.0|Another great novel by Grisham that will capture your interest from the very beginning. If you haven't read Grisham yet, try this book!
B00843TZJM|4.0|A band that defined a generation. The only reason I did not give this five stars is the lack of blu ray sound processing.  One of the best harmonizing trios ever and NO DTS High Definition Master recording is a disappointment.  Still, it is well recorded just compressed.  Yes, everybody is older, and voices are tad strained, but this is music that is about real life.  These guys are the real deal.  And they can still play very well.  Excellent
0385535147|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, but then I enjoy Grisham's style of writing.  I was hooked on the first page!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|After reading Keith Richards book, I purchased my first Rolling Stones GRRR cd.  I can only quote &#34;Tony The Tiger&#34; by saying this GRRR cd is GRRRReat.  CM. Pittsburgh, Pa.
0525423842|5.0|I bought this book and gave it to a young teen.  It's a good read and I'm glad Grisham has the younger readers in mind as he writes!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|This movie is great for children and adults. The story line never drags.  No pun intended.  The water animation is incredible. The character voices were chosen well.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a great movie for fathers to watch.  It is a heartwarming and beautiful portrayal of fatherhood and the example fathers should be to their children and wives.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this for my kids and they love this book. This is great book. Kids should read this book.
B009LRE040|4.0|I only gave it four stars because THE DARK KNIGHT was better. Killer ending. Tom Hardy as Bain is superb.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I can count on one hand how many times I've stopped reading a book but thuis fell in that category. I don't know what happened to Cornwell's writing but this was yet another terrible disappoinment. This used to be a great series but now it's way too much psycho babble. Pass on this (and any of her other more recent books)
B003UBTX6S|4.0|It was an entertaining book.  Felt like a more mature version of some of these other books like Twilight but maybe not as entertaining as a Harry Potter type book.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. I would have to place it as my second favorite out of the entire Bourne series. I thought the acting by everyone, including supporting actors with small roles was very good to excellent. This lacked that elusive fifth star because the final action seen was only so so and unfortunately Rachel Weise saves the day. The movie of course left room for a sequal but we did not get much closure at the end of the movie.<br />All that said, this is a good movie that I personally added to my collection and will probably find myself watching again from time to time.
1451627289|5.0|I bought this, but was hesitant to start to read it, The Kennedy assination has been done to death, but when I started this book, Stephen got me right away by his exceptional story telling ability. Read this!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Lets just go down the list. The acting was mediocre at best. The best acting came from Jessica Biel and unfortunately with a decent cast of actors I was expecting more. The storyline was terrible. Just a hint to the writers, if you want to do a remake that has the same name as the original, you have two options do a total overhaul making the new movie barely discernible from the original or simply remake the original with only slight alterations. This movie is neither. It is a terrible mix of of about 75 percent original movie line and 25 percent new. Unfortunately the 25 percent new made the movie worse than the original. I was sorry I payed for the rental of this movie after watching.<br />The caliber of script and production/direction combined would have made for a great science fiction channel original movie made for tv. If launched that way I would probably give four stars.<br />I wanted to give this a higher rating because I enjoyed the original, but with lack luster acting and a terrible storyline that barely builds to a crescendo I would only give this 2.5 stars. Basically for the effects and the cast.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|It was exactly as I expected and works well. The original cord was falling apart and this is the replacement.
B001EIOOVS|5.0|Loved the additional features as well as the quality of this film. I finally get the Blue Ray Thang loved the Hi-Def.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I recently purchased a copy for a Christmas gift, so I haven't received it yet.  I wouldn't view it because it is a gift.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|OK so it all turns out well in the end - or at least there seems to be a chance that it may. That such a damaged child could ever overcome the trauma of his past is entirely doubtful. And the fact that the main character was 10 years of age in 1944 and there is no mention at all that WW II was raging at that time strikes me as odd. The slow and deliberate conversations of the friends may well typify their realities - but the style was over done and made the reading really stodgy in places.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like playing &#34;Solitaire&#34;, so to be able to play it on my Kindle Fire is wonderful.  However, I find it difficult to move the cards if I don't use my stylus.  This game more than meets my expectations.

0316228532|4.0|When J.K. Rowling first announced that she was writing a new book for adults, I vowed that I would read anything she wrote, no matter what it was about.  I knew it would be hard to keep my expectations in check-- I love the Harry Potter books-- but I also knew Rowling to be a truly great storyteller and I was excited to see what new direction she might take.<br /><br />My first impression of The Casual Vacancy (through the first 30-50 pages) was not great.  I got the sense that Rowling was trying a little too hard to make it obvious that this was nothing like Harry Potter.  It struck me as a vulgar soap opera.  I'm so glad that I kept reading!<br /><br />Rowling tells a heartbreaking and raw story of the pain inflicted-- both intentionally and unintentionally-- by the residents of a small town on their neighbors, friends, and family.  Even with such a large cast of characters, Rowling manages to develop them well-- the characters are intricate and complex.  The story itself is artfully \\"normal.\\"  Nothing extraordinary or, dare I say, magical, happens to cause the events that unfold.  Rather, it is through typical, daily life in the town that the characters manage to change the lives of those around them irrevocably.  It is a chilling tale with unexpected twists.  Perhaps the end results are not so surprising, but the path itself is incredible and devastating.<br /><br />This is certainly not a book for everyone.  It is heavy.  That said, it is incredible.  Rowling's characters are real and unforgettable.  Her story is incredibly well told and disturbingly believable.  It is certainly no vulgar soap opera, as I first thought.  It is insightful, thought-provoking and heart-breaking, with just enough good to give me hope.  I look forward to Rowling's next book.  There's no doubt now-- I will ready anything she writes.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|It kept me glued to the screen through out the movie.  I recommend it to every one, watch Sherlock Homes first...you understand all as it plays:)
B004VUP8WK|4.0|So the popular buzz about Morbid Angel's new album, which is their eighth studio effort, is that it has been torched (almost universally) for being too experimental. This is such a widely-known fact that it almost overshadows the fact that this is MA's first album in eight years, and their first in over fifteen years to feature original frontman David Vincent. And make no mistake, 2011's \\"Illud Divinum Insanus\\" does definitely have some experimental leanings. In fact, some of the songs end up sounding like a soundtrack to a Tim Burton movie, whereas others seem like they could have been lifted straight off of a Marilyn Manson demo.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />The vast majority of the songs are not experimental in the least bit. In fact, if the album loses points for anything, it is that it is usually too familiar-sounding. As such, longtime fans of the band should be satisfied with \\"Illud...\\", and the more open-minded listeners should just view the experimental songs as a way of making this record distinguishable from all of the others in the Morbid Angel catalogue.<br /><br />And sure, original drummer/co-founder Pete Sandoval might be absent, here, due to medical reasons, but he is replaced by Tim Yeung, who is an undeniably excellent drummer (even if he isn't QUITE as godly as Sandoval). Thus, this former Vital Remains and Divine Heresy-skinsman fits like a glove with the rest of the band, as he unleashes barrage after crushing barrage of pummeling blast beats and punishing double bass waves. Furthermore, the catchiness and intelligibility of Vincent's vocals, the brutal fretboard majesty of Trey Azagthoth both evoke classic Morbid Angel death metal.<br /><br />The album can be divided into two parts: The experimental and the non-experimental. First, I will describe the former. \\"Omni Potens (Intro)\\" is a darkly ominous and symphonic-sounding opener with industrial-tinges and some creepy, Nile-esque chanting. Later on, \\"Too Extreme!\\" (which is a steady beating with pounding, thunderous rhythms and effects-laden vocals) and the very mid-tempo march of closer \\"Profundis -- Mea Culpa\\" are two pieces of almost straight-up, Candlemass-inspired doom metal. Finally, \\"Radikult\\" is an ominous and new-wavy piece of pure, Nine Inch Nails-meets-Marilyn Manson-meets Ministry industrial music, complete with trippy keyboards and a pleasantly melodic bass line.<br /><br />Now, the latter. \\"Existo Vulgore\\" (which boasts fiery thrash riffing and a terrific, ripping, winding guitar solo) and \\"Blades For Baal\\" (which has some especially abrasive and chunky, grinding guitar hooks) both feature plenty of brutal drumming (including blankets of stop-start blasts and blistering thrash beats).\\"I Am Morbid\\" brings back that great, impeccably tight drumming, and augments it with some piercing melodic guitar soloing and memorable vocal patterns (check out that chant-along refrain near the end!). \\"More Dead\\" anchors chunky, staccato riffing with driving, interlocking double-time drumming, and lets rip an epic, lengthy, ascending and descending guitar solo that is vintage Morbid Angel. \\"Destructos Vs. The Earth/Attack,\\" however, takes a page out of the Amon Amarth playbook, as it gets by on hooky, galloping rhythms and headbangable, stop-start hooks. Some tasty whammy-bar drenched lead and solo work is included, here, as well. Finally, tracks eight and nine, \\"Nevermore\\" and \\"Beauty Meets Beast,\\" are backed by fiery, thrashy, buzzsaw riffing, and jackhammer-fast blast beat pummel. (And the latter tune is also highlighted by two nicely melodic solos.)<br /><br />No, \\"Illud Divinum Insanus\\" is not anywhere close to be as classic of an album as, say, \\"Altars Of Madness\\" (Morbid Angel's debut), \\"Blessed Are The Sick,\\" or \\"Covenant.\\" And no, it shouldn't have taken eight whole years to create. But it is in no way should any of that imply that this is a bad album, either. In fact, it is pretty darn good and even borderline great. And like all MA records, this one is an essential inclusion in the collection/playlist of all diehard death metal fans.ne is an essential inclusion in the collection/playlist of all diehard death metal fans.

B00A3CVFMM|5.0|Both by Howard Shore, so no surprise there. I think the underlying &#34;theme&#34; that permeates the various tracks. Can't wait to see the actual movie.
B00APUQJLO|4.0|I watched an interview with some of the cast of this movie and it interested me enough to take a look. I was not expecting a lot given Pattinson's rather vacant performances in other roles. That vacuity serves him well in this role, and he even breaks out of it for brief periods.<br /><br />The movie is idea driven, and certainly not for everyone. I took it for what it was, a scathing indictment of modern society. A society that has turned human beings into commodities, and the human condition into an equation. I might not agree with everything that the film was trying to convey, but it did make me feel the way I think the director wanted me to feel. In touch with everything, in touch with nobody. The cinematography it good, and the acting is fairly good as well. I can recommend it as long as you're not expecting a fast paced thrill-ride.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|It doesn't matter how old you are, E.T. will capture your heart and hold it forever. I bought this movie for my grandson, who really hadn't heard much about E.T.  He loves the movie!

B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual, Vince Flynn delivers another great Mitch Rapp page-turner.  Mr. Flynn has become of of my favorite authors over the past few years.  I just started reading the Mitch Rapp series early this year, and after the first in the series, I read all the rest in the recommended order before the end of summer.  Mitch Rapp is a patriot hero for today's times.
030758836X|4.0|I understand Flynn is primarily a suspense novelist but I'd love to see her write a more realistic novel about marriage itself.  The first half of this novel is a terrifically insightful representation of how two people can see what's happening in a relationship in diametrically opposed ways.  But then Flynn pulls the rug out from under the reader--certainly in a clever way, but I was disappointed. I won't give away the surprise, but it would have been very interesting to see how two relatively ordinary people coped with their disappointments in each other.

B002GYI9C4|5.0|I was, probably like many, first introduced to Brandon Sanderson through his work on the Wheel of Time. I thought he gave the series much needed new life and began to wrap up the seemingly unending story, without making it feel overly rushed. However, I was hesitant for a few years to read his own work as I questioned his ability to create his own world (and got sucked into the Game of Throne series). Having just finished the Mistborn Trilogy I can honestly admit that I was completely wrong.<br /><br />Starting with Mistborn, Mr. Sanderson, builds a intriguing fantasy world which constantly evolves and the reader is often kept guessing as to what will happen next. I loved the characters and was pleased at how they \\"grew\\" over time. And the world of \\"magic\\" that Mistborn is based on was, to my mind, unique, intriguing and consistent.<br /><br />After finishing this book I quickly completed the trilogy.
B0083GOPSG|3.0|I felt like this movie was great idea, but something about it just didn't click. The acting was fine and the effects were good, but the style made it harder for me to connect with characters. So in the end I just didn't feel for them or with them.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I never imagined them making a game for all on portable devices, let alone one with full voices of key characters in the show. I originally just got it because of ponies, but then it started with actual voiced dialogue and I thought that was really something special. For fans of the show it's a nice game to play, but don't get to addicted because the game is long.

I couldn't possibly write a review about Hopeless or Colleen Hoover's brilliant writing or story telling abilities that would do justice.  She blew me away with Slammed and Point of Retreat.  So I set the bar pretty high with Hopeless.  She blew that bar away. It's raw, real and a complete emotional roller coaster.

B005HSL626|2.0|I loved it before this happened. For a few days, the wi-fi was turned off. When the wi-fi was turned back on, I couldn't get to the main menu. I was depressed the first time it happened. Halfbrick needs to fix that to make others worry about this. I still can't get it on the main menu. It's been 9 or 10 or 8 months since I couldn't get on Fruit Ninja Free. Depression fills my heart when I can't get to the main menu. It will be a miracle if I can get on this app now. I would have rated it 5 stars if that didn't happen.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I looked forward to reading Sweet Tooth. While I had never read an Ian McEwan book before I knew of him. I thought there would be action in the form of an intelligent intelligence woman in MI5. I was so wrong. I did not care for the main character, or any of the characters, for that matter. I think McEwan should stick to having men as his main focus, for he certainly does not understand women. The main character fell in love with every man she met, bedded those she could and was so indecisive I wanted to scream. That said, McEwan is a good writer and kept my attention. That is why I didn't give this book one star.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love the novel for its suspense but at the same time I hated the characters because they where terrible people. I would read other books by this author but right now I am reading something cheerful to get the bad taste out of my mouth!

B002PJN59M|5.0|The Arthurian  legends existed before Sir Mallory compiled them into Le Morte d'Arthur but it is doubtful they would have given him the status he achieved in modern literature. without Mallory's work;  Camelot, Excalibur, the Lady of the Lake and perhaps even the Holy Grail wold not be as well known as they are. I first read it in my senior English class.  I am sure that it is not required reading in schools today.  That was a time of Flash Gordon, before Star Wars  and Harry Potter but gave kids the same wonderful feeling of adventure and escape. The major contribution of Boorman's movie is that it is essentially a true rendering of Mallory's work with little or no “Hollywood type” contrivances.  Enhanced by the marvelous score, including lots of Wagner, and magnificently executed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra the movie is simply a splendid way to spend and hour or so. No matter what age you are.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|It does what it's supposed to. It's decent quality, and pretty durable, especially for the price. The only problem I have with it is that the black flap on the outside of it (that turns into the stand) doesn't hold on so well when trying to make the holder into a stand (picture). if it shifts or anything, it will slide out of the slot, and fall over. Other than that, i like it.

B0090CMMIC|4.0|For being a band that's been around for a few years, I give them props for breaking it into the American music scene. They're headlining for Seether on (Young Guns') first US tour, and I think they have some improving to do as far as their music, but they've pretty much hit the nail on the head. They're talented. There are a few filler songs, and it's obvious which ones they are. But overall, you won't be disappointed. They're pretty good.
B0086700CM|5.0|this fast paced game has lots of challenges to conquer which keeps it interesting.  It takes a few rounds to get the hang of it...and then as you get better it seems like the runner speeds up.  Wish there was a function to slow him down.  Great fun - keeps you on your toes.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Seen this one in theaters. I didn't know too much about it going in but didn't walk out disappointed. I think they should have shed a little more light on the psychic abilities because that turns out to be a big role in the film later and when that part surfaces it kinda leaves you confused. By the time that part surfaced I completely forgot about the abilities some of the people have. Must say I did not expect that ending at all.<br /><br />I think this is one of those movies that are good, you watch a few times but will probably loose its value once you know what happens. More of a rent movie than one I'd buy.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|This one makes you think as you proceed. Seems almost too easy when you start but doesn't take too long before you have to really think about the moves to get that red square where it belongs. I have spent quite a bit of time with this one.
B005LAII12|2.0|I've heard so many great things about how funny this movie was. So I borrowed it from a friend expecting it to be as funny as everyone is making it out to be. There were several parts that were kinda funny but not how funny people are making it out to be. The whole movie is pretty boring and its like watching a live episode of family guy. Does Seth Macfarlane have an original bone in his body? Ted (talking bear), Family Guy (talking dog), Cleveland show (another talking bear) and American Dad (alien). Need I say more? They even do the lame cute scene jokes they do in family guy. There is really no point in the movie other than its about a guy who can't let go of the past. If your into tasteless dick and fart jokes and randomly making fun of people and all they do is smoke pot than this may be a movie for you. Other than that.. don't waist your time with this.

B00633W614|4.0|Book number 2 of the Clifton Chronicle is as good as the first one if not better. You need to read the first book first (Only time will tell) as the story continuous directly, no sum-up of book one at the beginning. It is a good story, well written. It's not a breathtaking book, but the story flows well. It is written in an unusual way as the different characters are telling the story from their view point, giving the reader a nice repetition in addition to enrich the story. I am looking forward to the release of the 3rd book.

1444710338|5.0|I'm a male, in my seventies, who about 15 months ago finally 'fessed up that I was probably 25 pounds overweight and ought to do something about it. Having never before tried any kind of diet regime, I wasn't sure how to go about it but I love food and I know myself, and I knew I didn't want to have to run miles, count calories, or eat tasteless meals.<br /><br />Browsing in a book store, I ran across Dr. Dukan's book and will admit I bought it mainly because I'd lived several years in France and admire their way of life: if the French like this diet, it can't be too bad. A very scientific way to choose a diet.<br /><br />Anyway, I started the diet and was astounded at the progress made in the three-day &#34;attack&#34; phase (I won't say how much, because not every case is the same - let's just say it was more than enough to make me see the potential for success). That encouraged me to move through the next phases and over the next three months I lost 26 pounds. A crucial part of the diet is the emphasis on teaching one how and what to eat so as to avoid putting the lost weight back on. I'm now eating very well, indeed, but pay attention to the quality and quantity of what I'm eating and without a lot of effort I've managed not to regain any of the lost weight. And my doctor is as happy about it as I am.<br /><br />I've recommended the diet to at least seven friends. Most like it, some don't. Some complain that the attack phase is too monotonous. My advice: it only lasts a couple of days; suck it up - the results are worth it. Merci, Dr. Dukan.

B008NW67E0|5.0|A lot of reviews I've read point to the fact that their style is really similar to Sigh No More, which i agree. The point is that Sigh No More was such a great album, that it shouldn't matter if the style is the same. It's worth the money to enjoy this album. It's more upbeat than a lot of their older work and really just a masterpiece.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It was exciting as a race would be, from beginning to end, just not enough intrigue for me.  My girlfriend loved it!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like having all of the disks in one set. I've owned a few individually and tend to think that those cases are higher quality. When this product went on sale, i decided that I would try this set; I was pleasantly surprised. I felt as though the disks are protected well in an attractive box. No complaints
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Enjoyed this movie and liked the story line and the way it tied into the other Alien movies at the end.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I really enjoyed the film adaptation of the book. To me, the only things that were removed were unimportant details. If you enjoyed the book, you'll enjoy the movie.<br /><br />For those who haven't read the book but love action, you'll enjoy it as well!
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|One of our all-time favorites to watch at least once each Holiday Season! A classic movie that puts our whole family in a festive, and thankful, spirit.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|A great middle book for the trilogy. Lots of action & suspense; it finished making you want to immediately start reading book 3. I became invested in even the lesser characters & was sad when some of them died, as everyone knew they would. It showed completely different and equally apalling aspects of the games to the first book, so necessary in order to keep the series going, and as believable as they are startling.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I have read the first two books from the Song of Ice and Fire, and I think it's worthwhile to mention I did not watch the TV series at all, although I watched 10minutes of it which had incredible effects and accurate characters which fit the books description perfectly. That said, my view on the written series is not bias toward the TV adaptation.<br /><br />A Clash of Kings introduced the war that was looming over Game of Thrones throughout it's story. I found the characters very well developed in this book, much like the debut novel. A difference between the sequel and the debut is most obviously the strong use of military strategy and tactics which was very interesting to read. Also in this book is the unfolding of chaotic events, which wasn't seen in Game of Thrones. I can say with a certainty that I did enjoy the majority of this book, and I actually bought it on my Kindle immediately after finishing Game of Thrones to see what happens next. And my reasoning for this is exactly what turned me off of the series after the second book.<br /><br />From the first book, the ending left many important questions unanswered, which felt to me like a weekly TV series cliffhanger. I personally enjoy to have a certain conclusion of some main events at the end of a book. And in a series I feel that the wide-open ending felt more like a single book rather than a sequel. I tolerated this cliffhanger in the first novel, but after reading this title, I was very discouraged from reading the series anymore. The book stops right at parts of the plot that are not yet complete by any means. This is understandable in a war scenario; however, there was not enough closure in the end of the book to satisfy my need to have a meaningful conclusion in any book (even those in a series). This was much like the first book, which compelled me to impulsively buy the sequel. But when I found that the series remained largely inconclusive even after the second book, I had enough.<br /><br />For those who like open ended books and those who read through series relatively quickly, this series may be for you, and as such I would recommend to it to that particular audience. For those lik me who desire some level of closure at the end of a long novel, I do not recommend this series at all. If the storyline interests you then I would suggest watching the TV series which seems to be very well produced and accurate (although apparently lacking a few occurrences here and there).<br /><br />I hope you all have a great reading experience whether from &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; (if its your type of structured writing style), another series or standalone book.<br /><br />Best Wishes<br /><br />---Greg Jankowskise who like open ended books and those who read through series relatively quickly, this series may be for you, and as such I would recommend to it to that particular audience.

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|We had high expectations but this movie fell flat.  Same dumb jokes over and over.  A few funny parts here and there but overall nothing great.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|No Mars?  No air controversy! No Kuwato!  Would have liked to see them.  Kate Beckinsale does a great job and had some Sharon Stone moments.  Great effects.  They should have used Bryan Cranston more, he is an excellent actor and Cohagen is very one dimensional. Overall, a good thrill ride.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|Music awesome.  Vividly brought back memories of film.  Super good.  Music is special.  Not much more to say about it.
0385340990|3.0|At first this book is charming, presenting various different and, mostly, pleasant people, communicating with each other by letter and telegram.  London and Guernsey are still suffering the grim aftermath of WWII.  There has been terrible destruction in both places and the occupation of this Channel Island by the Germans is dreadful, and vividly-conveyed.  That the heroine is attractive is attested by the determined pursuit of her by an American magnate while the voices of the various members of the Literary Club are as convincing as Akenfield.<br />So far, so good; I was reading it with great delight but then it degenerated into melodrama with O.F. O'F. W.W.; one of the characters became a caricature of herself; and another, a male, a self-proclaimed homosexual, improbable in an epoch when it was illegal and in a society where the more worldly could refer to \\"proclivities\\" but the more naive, especially females, were unlikely to know anything about it at all let alone be comfortable with a self-proclaimed one.<br />The book is unequal.  The introduction of Remy doesn't develop the story about Guernsey at all and her sufferings put the mild growth of the love-affair out of kilter.
B009DH37CY|5.0|Nice to replace my VHS I taped off vh1. Excellent restoration of the film, both picture and audio. First class band, first class performance. Top band who was at the top of their game!
B0017HEX76|1.0|MAJOR RIP OFF  .......IN KOREAN  NOT COMPLETE......ID LIKE MY $ BACK...SO IF YOU DON'T SPEAK KOREAN RUNN AND IF YOU ARE OK WITH IT BEING IN COMPLETE THEN THATS GREAT HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT WALT DISNEY'S FANTASIA ...THIS IS AWFUL FOR THE MONEY
B007L6VR12|5.0|This movie started off a little strange, like maybe it was trying too hard to be weird. But it turns out it wasn't trying at all - it's naturally that way, which was so refreshing.<br />The portrayal of Social Services was coldly accurate, as I can attest from first hand knowledge of 'her'. The story was like having a wonderfully magical dream of childhood where kids do the right thing for each other and adults are mostly not shady, exploitative creeps. The delightful music reached into my body, got a grip on my spirit and pulled me along with the story like rushing down a river. The crescendos of music and plot were paired so perfectly that the movie felt almost interactive.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was spot-on. Especially the child actors, those two were brilliant.<br /><br />This is my new all-time second-favourite movie. Bruce Willis happens to be in the best movie ever created as well, so he must occasionally have fabulous taste in scripts. There is not a thing I would change about this movie. For my viewing pleasure, it was simply perfect. One of those kinda movies you are grateful for.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|I can´t believe. I have secret word in blu ray.<br />This is a timeless show, amazing songs and a wonderfull staging. And now it looks and sounds incredibly perfect.<br />I see this show so many times in the past and I will see it again over and over in hi def.<br />Don´t let go this mindblowing masterpiece.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Excellent written. Keeps you on your toes trying to figure out when Jack will be able to travel on. In short, a good book.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Blade runner needs no introduction. Is the best sci-fi movie ever.<br />And this edition makes justice to this modern masterpiece.<br />Definitly a must have. stop thinking and buy it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The was well written. Kept you on the edge of your seat. You knew that the main characters would survive but you could not be absolute sure they would. The suspense was intense.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It is laid out a little differently than the computer ebay page, but once I figured out the placement of all the functions it was great! Love this app.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I work in a law firm and this is a show that really captures what it's like to work in a big time law firm.  Great writing with the funny quips.  Definitely worth a watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Page turning entertainment! Enjoyed each book as much as the one before!<br />Would recommend this trilogy to everyone who wants to be entertained!
B001CDLATE|5.0|Own this blu-ray for a year now, and still use this to demo by high-end Epson projector, its colorful, visionary and have no words to say.<br />I would recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect 4K documentary with superb picture and sound.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I love almost anything that takes off for other worlds and even though this has a dark theme, it has plenty food for thought, artistic value and superior CGI work in it. It will transport you out of this world.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I really enjoyed the story, and I think the actors did an excellent job.
B003850T82|5.0|I have over 200 movies in my collection, I guess you can call me old fashioned but I like having the movie in it's orginal case, some nights I just browse through looking for something to watch the cover usally sells it for me
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this story. I became interested in the characters very quickly and found it difficult to put down!<br />I would reccomend this book to anyone 14 and older.
B002BWP49C|1.0|I received this movie in mid November, I choose to watch it for the first time today and when I put it in my laptop to watch it, there was NO picture to it. It is just a pixelated mess. I honestly wish I had not purchased the movie because it is no more than a paper weight....
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a very time-consuming game, and it is perfect for kids of all ages. So far, I've had no troubles with it, and there's no tricky fees, however I would watch out for children accidentally purchasing something. I enjoy this app; it passes the time.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Well done but the same ol same ol chase scene. Looking forward to what they do with the next one in the series
B008458O3S|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played.  The strategy and learning behind the game is awesome and the the levels only get harder every time, but you seem to be able to keep up by what you learned from the last levels.  I feel super accomplished after solving one of these and it is an amazing concept for a game.  Highly recommended!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I found the characters in this book were captivating.  I felt like the author made you feel like you really got to know the characters and i enjoyed reading about their lives.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If I were going to write a book this is the kind I would write.it is about an astronaut stranded on mars and how he survives the wait for rescue from earth. the technical details are superb Andy Weir must be an astrophysicist or have worked for NASA trying to figure out  all the solutions to problems the astronaut runs into not a easy thing but he does so brilliantly I sure hope he writes other books. i would have bought this one at a much higher price. if I had known about it.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I wasn't sure about this book at first - its not normally the sort of thing I read (although I love sci-fi, too much tech-talk tends to put me off) but I found Mark's log (which is how most of the book is presented) engaging and funny and ended up rooting for him to make it. I couldn't tell you if any of the science is plausible but it SEEMED like it was (Mark, our hero, explains every procedure in detail through the medium of his personal log, presumably so that anyone finding his body will know what he did and how he did it) and as a non tech that was good enough for me. I liked the exchanges between Mark and NASA, you could tell he was getting a little punchy with his wise crack remarks to what they saw as an awful, untenable situation (which might not only result in his death but bad publicity for their space program). All in all I have to say this was an unexpected find, one that I enjoyed and got through quite quickly. I did find that seeing the word 'intact' spelled as 'in-tact' many times grated a bit though and there were a few editing errors but those are small issues. I'll also never look at a potato the same way again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have gone through the same heart wrenching separation from my spouse, that I love so desperately. I have learned that he has just wanted sex and doesn't really love me after 33 years of marriage. Go figure.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Riveting, real, inspirational and fabulous in every way. Actually, kind of life-changing- this is the FIRST book that all of the DARS (the Drinking and Reading Society) loved- and we never agree on anything.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The book follows the story of Jack Ryan Jr is his many adventures. For some reason this book  did not have the same Clancy experience we all know and love.  May have something to do with a co-writer.
B00433TO52|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever purchased on amazon and would highly recommend other people do the same..
B0076DELIG|3.0|This may not have been my cabirite Harry Bosch story but it was GREAT! Lots of twists and turns and a door open at the end.....can't wait till the next one xomesbout
B0076DELIG|5.0|Alway a good read. I look forward to each new book and I'm not disappointed. I would wish for him a better romance tho.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great to see we now have a new Christmas classic to watch every Christmas season!  Will Ferrell is hilarious as always.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show!!! Two big thumbs up.  Best show on TV<br />On the edge excitement... Look forward to it each week
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Interesting story but a little convoluted.  I didn't especially like the ending- it seemed a bit abrupt after all the action.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|BEST. BOOK. EVER. Colleen is a GEM. Read it in one night, knowing after the first date, I'd not put it down till it said The End.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great story and many twists and turns.  It made me want to know what happened to him after the book ended.  A sequel?
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Continuing the saga of Sherlock Holmes, not quite as good as the first movie but still worth the time to watch.
1451695195|5.0|As soon as I heard about this book, I knew I must read it.  It was a great price, no s/h with Amazon Prime & I received it immediately.  It is a soft cover book & grabs your attention from the very first page.  Fascinating subject.  Great deal. Very happy
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Good end to the series, though like lot's of others, sad to see it end at all.  This was a pretty good rendering of the books finally.
1451629184|5.0|This is a wonderful true story of human resilience and inner strength that Jaycee went through. Amazing woman she is I can't even begin to imagine the horror she lived through yet came out a strong self assured woman and mom.
B00005JKC3|3.0|A slightly different take on the Hulk story, a little slower a little more intimate but worth watching for a different angle.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Katniss is relatable and the story is genuinely captivating I couldn't put it down can't wait to read the next 2 books
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Much better than Die Hard 3 which is a complete waste of time, this one returns you to the action.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Heavy use of superb quality graphics/CGI produced a suspenseful, fast paced and engaging film!<br /><br />The construct of the future world this story is set in was very well done, really takes you away and into the reality of that world.<br /><br />If you like action, drama and sci-fi films then this one is for you - all rolled into one.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|This was good series ender, still in line with the other two and lot's of action.  New girl, cuter than Megan possibly.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I wasn't sure if this would work, but I decided to try it anyway and I'm certainly glad that I did.  It has made finding music and videos easy to both find and download.  You can download as either a music format or as a video and you can organize your music and videos into plalists as well.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Good movie as an Avengers build up, a way of knowing more about the character if you haven't read all of the comic books.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|I was (and still am) a great fan of the original, so when I watched this one I didn't have very high expectations for for it.  Boy was I wrong!  While the two movies have a lot in common, even some of the same music, its the differences that make this WELL worth the effort.  Seeing the original accident which led to the passing of the anti-dancing laws (which you also see being voted on), tells you very quickly that this is not a cookie-cutter remake.  The leads are both attractive, with good chemistry and a tallented cast of supporting actors make this a remake worth the time it takes you to watch it.  ENJOY!  I know you will.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was far funnier than I thought it would be and had some great action, it works the comic better than I thought possible.
B00633W614|5.0|This series takes you on the journey with the characters.  I feel as though I know them personally and feel their fears and joys. Can't wait to read the third in the series.
B00009ZYC0|3.0|Not the best movie by Tom Cruise but an interesting if unrealistic Sci-fi fantasy future, I like it for the action.
B003KK6GJQ|4.0|Wasnt  too sure about the book at the start, but kept with it and loved it.<br />The ending is unbelievable........I cried.
B000UD0ESA|4.0|Good sci-fi movie for people who like truely creative sci-fi worlds.  It's an interesting take on a future earth with androids.
0060873175|5.0|Micro, by Michael Crichton and Richard Preston is pretty much a classic Crichton fiction.  Crichton had written three quarters of the book at the time of his death and Preston was selected to finish it.  I have read every book Crichton wrote and I found no glaring transitions.  The story was exciting and engrossing enough that I didn't notice any changes in style.<br />This book is an intelligent adventure somewhat like Jurassic Park.  The story revolves around an insane executive who shrinks seven graduate students when they discover he is a murderer.  Once he gets them about a half an inch tall, his plans to feed them one by one to a snake are disrupted and the students end up in the wild woods.  Here they are confronted with the reality of what really goes on all around us, but is too small to really see.  Now the students are faced with thousands of predators and have gone from the top of the food chain to almost the bottom.  They have one back pack with a few things they can use, but it's what's in their heads that saves some and dooms others.<br />The Nano tech, the insect and microbe world and the psychology of the students all interact to create a great story.  There is intelligence, love, menace and sorrow constantly butting up against madness, deadly micro weapons and giant insects.  All of this is woven tightly together to make this last Crichton tale memorable.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|love dune always have, this is my favorite version of the film since it shows the water of life and the fight that gave Paul his new fremen name, great added details for fan of the film and books.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I love it. Easy to use. I have two of them and we even have one at work. Very handy.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I loved the original growing up and this version is a joy as well, it's a different and quirky take but I love it.
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|I saw Billy Elliot in the theaters when it first came out. It instantly touched my heart so deeply. I had recently lost my Mother, and the story resonated so much with me. My mom was my biggest cheerleader in life, and she taught me nothing is impossible if your heart drives you. She was right and this film proves it. An absolutely wonderful story that is superbly acted! And, the music remains some of the most toe-tapping numbers, ever!
B001FQDLV8|2.0|I enjoy the Dune series but the lister of this product was aweful and lied.  Claimed it was hardback and in good condition but sent me paperback in not good condition.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|4HWW changed my business. 4HB changed my way of eating/exercising. 4HC taught me to master seemingly impossible activities. Used the techniques to become kickass in chess, something I always wanted to do.
0767805712|3.0|This is an interesting look at Genetics taken to the extreme in a future that could be dominated by it's use.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I really liked this movie! If you like movies set in this time period than this movie is for you!
6305311463|3.0|Good movie if you like the end of the world stuff or sci-fi; it's not serious but is entertaining and has some action.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I loved this movie! It has such a wonderful story and even though I have seen many versions of this movie I liked this one most! :)
B0002KVUKM|4.0|intersting take on the count dracula tale, far more action and funny; and who doesn't love Kate Beckinsale in tight pants seriously.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome! Can't wait for the next season. I watched these episodes back to back until the whole season was over.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|This movie is an interesting twist much like being John Malcovich but better far more visually stimulating.  It's like your own imagination come to life when wanting to escape lifes troubles.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Use FB on internet instead of the app. The app crashes all the time. It doesn't keep it's  place either. scrolls to top of page by itself and you have to start browsing all over from the beginning every time.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I liked this movie even better than clash of the titans which was a pretty good remake of a classic.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ready to read book 2 because book 1 was so intoxicating!!! LOVED IT!!! So glad I jumped on the band wagon and started this series!
B002ZG977Y|4.0|a pretty good remake of a classic I watched when I was a kid, definetly an improvement on the older version.
B009VLXMJA|4.0|A couple of songs on this album are killer, but some are just run of the mill Taylor.  Overall good album, though.
B0002V7OI8|4.0|Good movie if you like the end of the world stuff, but a little slow if you don't.  The action isn't bad but it's not over the top like Armaggedon.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|Wow this book was bad.I bought because they said it was better than the first one.when in reality it was worst.at least the first one was ok because it was almost a replica of fifty shades, but this was just trash.the only good part in the bookwas literary towards tree end, for two reasons.one the whole killing and two because I was finally done with this crap. Would not waist my money.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Great movie if you like end of the world stuff, lot's of action, non-stop for two hours action.  Even if you don't believe in the stuff it's still fun to watch, keep you on the edge of you seat.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Greenblatt presents an engaging story about the fortunes of a manuscript of Lucretius' De Rerum Natura, though the actual revival of Epicurean atomism proves far more complicated. The full story has more to do with the publication of the skeptical writings of Sextus Empiricus, Gassendi's embrace of Epicurus over Aristotle, the vigorous British rejection of Descartes by materialists like Hobbes. Revolutionary changes in the ways we view reality take time and a cast of thousands to effect them. Yet, poetry does have its way of captivating thought more than linear argument can.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly always comes up with an interesting LA history to build a great case.  Well done and a good read.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It has several levels<br />Some levels are more challenging than others<br />User Friendly game<br />Works very well, so far no gliches
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I play this game A LOT! It's super addictive and fun (&amp; I feel accomplished when I completed a level) but I hate the adds &amp; when you've completed a puzzle if it pops up you can't click &quot;play again&quot; &amp; also you only get 3 hints (the ?s) &amp; then is $0.99 for 5 more!! I haven't needed the hints &amp; if I'd known there wouldn't be more (earned in game play or something) then I would not have wasted them. I do recommend it, but it's not perfect.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|MoboPlayer is the best add-on for a Kindle Fire. You can play all those AVI files instead of having to convert them. I highly recommend MoboPlayer for everyone who has a Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This series is so awesome-and I've loved the original stories of Sherlock since I was a kid. To create this modern version was risky, but they nailed it. I've been a huge fan of Martin Freeman since the BBC Office, and Benedict Cumberbatch is so unique and intense, compelling both in style and character. He brings out the subtle emotion of Sherlock in just the right amounts - Sherlock is a very complex character. Like any series the metamorphosis of the characters continues to develop and become more complex throughout each episode. And Moriarty is so sinister and bizarrely awesome. It was like crack--once we watched one episode we couldn't wait to watch the next. Since there aren't many episodes we broke each episode in half so we could draw it out as long as possible. The ending is amazing. Warning: not a show you can watch while you do other things around the house--it requires attention to detail and focus. Plus, you want to watch every subtle nuance of the characters. Highly recommend.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|A very detailed history of WWI. It includes the historical characters of Germany, United States and Russia. There are many love and family stories that are engrossing and is a good picture of society during that era.
B007HJB6OG|5.0|Despite whether or not u like the genre, no one can doubt that the care, detail, and passsion that everyone from the producers to the actors to all the other departments envolved in this show is true and absolute. I have never read the books and I doubt if I ever will, but this is a top quality show that appears to be faithful to them and I see it continuing to be successful beyond three or four seasons.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site offers some great ideas for everyone. With fantastic pictures to make you smile or laugh. It has something for everyone.
0743487486|3.0|A challenging but ultimately rewarding way to address issues in parenting. Ultimately  this has good run on effects into everyday life. As with all things parenthood, this should be read with an open mind and critically assessed before deciding this philosophy is helpful to you. For me and my family it has been so far. :)
B009MF56GC|5.0|This is a guilty pleasure film. The plot is simple, but the bad guys are bad, the heroes are accurate and well-armed, and getting the old  gang together is fun. Don't quibble about ammo counts, physics or the bad guys accuracy (those guys don't practice anyway). This movie is about having the good guys be great. Get some pop corn, a beverage of your choice and enjoy.<br /><br />My wife, who usually hates these types of movies, gave it a 7 / 10 stars. That is pretty high praise from her.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|dancing is awesome,story line laughable.good for a girls nite out.get some riends together and have a party,or make your man learn how to dance
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Very disappointing.  I've read others by Mcewan and looked forward to this, but it seemed pointless, and the &#34;surprise&#34; ending was predictable and meaningless.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|second season runs alittle slower then expected,but character development is good and the zombies and all special  effects are awesome
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you have an open mind, read this and see what you think.<br />Technical in places, but overall it is readable.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love Supernatural.The series has everything,comedy,drama, monsters and pie.For anybody who hasnt seen it,i feel sorry for you.pick up season one and get on the road trip
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's a great book. Couldn't put it down. Very easy to read, hoping my 10 year old enjoys it like I did
B002M2T1UO|5.0|best cop drama ever on t.v, if you want surprises you wont be disappointed.the cast is excellent together and the episodes leave you wanting more
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|bad piggies a great game well though out and would recommend it to all age groups. i give it five stars
B004HO6I2O|5.0|I had very low expectations when this movie began, but I was pleasantly surprised- it made me laugh out loud from start to finish. \\"The Change-Up\\" is a foul-mouthed bonanza of crude, crass humor, perfectly delivered by the talents of Bateman and Reynolds.<br /><br />At first, I was disappointed to see that the plot of this movie was to follow a story that has already been exhaustively explored in other movies, like \\"Freaky Friday\\" and \\"Big\\". But I've decided that this is fine, and that the \\"change-up\\" theme is actually quite palatable, if you consider it to be a sub-genre of the comedy field, much like you might consider the \\"buddy cop\\" concept to be a sub-genre. Sure, it's been done several times before, but it's sort of become its own thing now. And \\"The Change-Up\\" does enough to bring its own brand to the sub-genre to make it stand out- namely embracing the notion of hard-R comedy that is aimed squarely at adults (under no circumstances watch this movie with your children, or you WILL be embarrassed!).<br /><br />Granted, you can't just throw a bunch of curse words into the script and expect it to be funny. But that's where the talents of Bateman and Reynolds shine, and their hilarious delivery carries the movie wonderfully. My friends and I had a great time watching this at home, and we couldn't stop laughing!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I read many other diary of a wimpy kid, but none are as good as the third wheel. I love how greg is  a kind and likable person
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I have always loved dragons and now I get to breed my own! I am already playing this on iPod and now am starting on my Kindle Fire. What a difference!<br />Some of them can be pretty frustrating to try to breed though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was very suspenseful, which I like.  I could barely put it down.  I do plan to read more books by this same author, as I thoroughly enjoyed this one.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This is another good Bosch Novel but I think the writing is getting a little thinner. I am used to Great Bosch novels like &#34;Concrete Blonde&#34; and I think that Connelly may be running thin on material for Bosch. It's a good read, don't get me wrong just not the great read which I am used to.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It was because sometimes it gave the wrong definition for word I wanted to look up.it was still good.<br />Thanks
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This book is a sheer joy. Not only is the pilgrimage unlikely, so too is the protagonist, Harold himself. the character restores one's faith in the capacity of the human spirit to overcome all that confronts one. As with all pilgrimages, there is a cleansing of the spirit, this time of Harold and his wife. The scenes are delightfully drawn and the various odds and sods who try to take over from Harold are deftly put in their place. The writing pleasantly draws the reader into Harold's life, his equanimity, doubts, forgiveness, and his finding how to love himself.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Always a twist you don't expect!  Grisham is the master of keeping you up way too late, I couldn't put it down!
B007R3AZNK|3.0|The songs were rough - hewn and too raw for my taste. His great guitar riffs were too infrequent and the flow of the record was inconsistent.
B0031QNDUO|5.0|I gave this rating because this is one of my favorite Christmas movies and i was so in the mood to watch it on tuesday of this week while i was out and lucky for me you had it available for streaming. The quality was excellent
B007SXB498|5.0|My 2nd favorite Austen novel after &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;. I bought it for my Kindle to enjoy over and over.
B00A6PD8RQ|1.0|I paid for HD. The movie was far from being HD. I should not have been charge for HD movie since the quality was so poor.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|Anyone who appreciates this sci-fi classic should buy this edition.  Once you've seen the movie a dozen times you can go on to behind the scenes and learn about the set construction and filming conditions which make it even more amazing. Then when you watch the movie again you can appreciate it even more and notice things in the background that you might never have noticed before.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV. I love that they don't follow the 'rules' of regular shows. You NEVER know what to expect. I love that they are able to 'shock' me week after week!!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|As Always, I enjoyed this book by David Baldacci. He tells a good story. This one was a real page turner.<br />I hope he can keep writing books that grab my attention like this one did.
B000GGSM94|5.0|this is one of the best albums ever.<br />order arrived earlier than expected<br />very pleased with order and with the album.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Not just the pop-ups in between EVERY hand, but if your opponent forfeits or wins and the confirmation screen pops up at the same time you tap the deck for the next card, it boots you out of multi-player so you have to reconnect. Too many ads can make a free app not worth the installation. Love the app in Vegas mode otherwise.
B000002H70|5.0|this is one of the best albums ever.<br />order arrived earlier than expected<br />very pleased with order and with the album.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband since he was Joe Bonamassa on TV and has wanted to hear more of his music.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I've had these for less then 3 months now and they are already completely failing me. The battery no longer charges, sometimes they won't even turn on at this point, or start buzzing really loudly. All these problems are really not worth the money.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|What a wonderful movie!  I will watch it again and again.  Hopefully it will win an Academy Award this year.
B009O2XY12|2.0|Tries to upgrade your shooter in the came for 99cents and u could really accidentally press ok. So I deleted it. AND every day  it will chime in like oh help the bunnnys save whatever.. in a text message and its annoying . So I deleted it. over all good game though!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|JUST A NICE RELAXING GAME, ENJOY ABLE TO GET MORE CHANCES WITHOUT BUYING, CUTE CHARACTERS, GREAT DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. RECOMMEND TO ALL WHO WANT A LITTLE SLOWER PACE.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Sick & Stupid Score:  6/9*<br /><br />More of the current national neurosis that is gripping the Ritalin Generation:  Your memories are not your own; you have no idea who you are; an evil force is controlling your life.  And way more of the feminist fantasy that girls can be as tough as boys.  More escape-and-capture sequences than a 1930's cowboy and Indian Saturday matinee movie.  More \\"Blade Runner\\"-style racial diversity than \\"Blade Runner.\\"  More computer-generated graphics than....<br /><br />When will these awful movies ever end?<br /><br />____________________________<br />* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|What can you say, it's the best weather app available in my opinion.  Up to date info for wherever you happen to be.

B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Grandson very happy little boy. Loves opening new door everyday. He can't wait to see what is hidden. If he is happy so am I.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Good read - would recommend the book. I also read the other previously written similar book which I enjoyed as well.
B009CPES4I|4.0|We thought this was a very watchable story.  Not your run of the mill plot.  We're glad we watched it.
B002H3EUA4|5.0|This is one of the top best Christmas movies of all time so i'm not going to try to sell you on something that sells itself. The Santa hat that comes with it comes in a vacuum sealed bag witch is good and bad the bad the white lining has a faint red color in a spot or two but its light and silky to the touch, coasters are great to bring out for the holidays, snow is still in the box and will continue to stay there. The button is a cool little price of memorabilia. So it is worth the low price of this item.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This mini-series is so well done.  I have watched at least 4 times.  This is one movie you must add to your collection.  It's like watching Anne of Green Gables or You've Got Mail.  Right up there with the classics.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I had it on the micro cruuz and am trying to get it on the Win 8 mid it has has all hard to find music on it

B005LAIGSM|5.0|Received this movie a months ago and was very satisfied.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is so fun. you wood think that you wood hate it.It so much like littlest pet shop. I love it get it right now.
B00866JL96|5.0|Was a sweet romantic love story,like Zac Efron. The movie brought tears to my eyes, watched it many times. Good movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I waskind of curiós to know what would happen although we could guess  but it was fun and I enjoes it
B008WCP2PG|5.0|What can I say, it was an awesome movie. My love Channing did his thing as well as Matthew. Way to go Channing!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I only redargúis one because I wanted to get to the end. The frisa half I thought was kind of boring but it got more exciting in the last part. Anyways it was able to keep the climate.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|What a fun movie for young and old! The animation was great, and the humor was very funny! I would highly recommend this addition to your holiday movie collection.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Harlequin romances rarely come up to standard; while this one wasn't terrible, it was just OK.  It was free on Kindle so the price was right.<br /><br />Connor wants an intelligent woman to fulfill the wifely duties involved in his millionaire lifestyle, without the entanglements of romance.  Megan has given up on men but wants children.  After a little too much to drink, they walk down to the nearest Vegas wedding chapel and tie the knot.  The next morning Megan thinks better of the deal and wants an annulment.  After some persuasion she finally agrees to a 3 month marriage trail period.<br /><br />After an interesting start, this book falls flat with one-dimensional characters and a too predictable plot line.  The book is very narrowly focused on the relationship between this two, forgoing interactions with business associates friends and family.  Connor and Megan are just not that interesting and frankly I didn't care if they stayed together or not.
0061122092|5.0|As with all of Coelho (that I've read so far), I loved it. So many little gems of wisdom throughout. Very uplifting and freeing.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Great action film with the good OLD guys from action movies of the past.  You have to know what you are planning to watch.  It is a action film with old action actors.  If you plan for that you will not be disappointed.  If you expect a great plot or chick flick look to another film.<br /><br />I actually liked it better than the first one....<br /><br />-Z
B004EK926K|5.0|The picture was great and my kids loved it.  I love that it was an animation but it looked very real.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|and it hasn't shown up on my phone yet.  I went back to repurchase it and it says I already did and tells me where to go find it but I can not find it so I can not really fully say if it's bad or good.  I guess it's really lost in the clouds ;)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Funny and hilarious and I love the twist at the end. It was the best twist I have ever read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book....literally could not put it down. Everything about it was so believable.....the characters were all consuming....the storyline was wonderful! I found myself breathless at many parts....I cried, I laughed, I got angry....oh the emotions are so raw throughout this! You can't help to love Holden....I kept reminding myself, this boy is 18! God love him! Great job Colleen Hoover.....this book rocks! :)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I liked this on my iPad.  Ordered it for my wife's Kindle Fire, mostly as a joke, but we'll see if she gets adicted.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Zeppelin does justice to close out their legacy. Film quality is excellent as is the sound. The added low end fidelity was a nice addition in comparison to the 70's recordings. All members added  tasty flourishes here and there to keep things current sounding. I found myself really enjoying the performance and was surprised to hear how tight the show was without being too perfect. A talent inherent to Page's playing, where emotion over sterile repitition is the norm.<br /><br />Thank you for putting this out guys.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|As with many Steven King novels, this one could have been shortened by about 300 pages with no material loss to the story.  That being said, this was one of King's best in my opinion.  I am fascinated by the concept of time travel, and with all things JFK, so this novel was right up my alley.  It really did not disappoint.  I would recommend this to any readers even if they aren't generally Stephen King fans.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I am not the kind of person who usually buys this kind of cd but I am a huge Buble fan so I figured I would give it a shot. From the moment I heard the first song I instantly knew that this will soon become an album I listen to every christmas
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I decided to read it after seeing previews for the movie coming out.  It was my first Nicholas Sparks read.  It was what I expected: a quick, easy read but I certainly enjoyed it!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Fascinating insight into the motivations and machinations of a remarkable group of people all on the same inevitable path toward the ultimate conflict.
1939416019|5.0|Great book. Like the story line. A few minor spelling errors like foul instead of fowl. Looking forward to next book.not sure why some Tate o critical, but I enjoyed book.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Another great tale from Jo Nesbo. As usual the story builds in excitement to the point that I simply couldn't put aside. It has several twists and turns that kept me shaking my head at the surprises. Loved it, and will be eagerly waiting to read what comes next.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. It wasn't bogged down by slow parts of story but well paced. The action was great but wasn't so much that that's all it was. You enjoyed the characters. Charlize Theron plats evil well that's for sure. Well worth watching.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|You really feel a true since that the author's story is real and not made up.  The way he tells of his experience seems very much authentic.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Easy to learn. Lots of levels. Never boring.<br />Definitely lots of fun setting up your own villiage and hatching eggs.
B007THA4FI|1.0|At first I thought the story was interesting.  I did not need the sexual escapades of juviniles or the extreme use of words that I find offensive.  I refer to the use of a derogatory word used to describe females, whether they are adult or teenagers.  I read halof of it and deleted ilt from my collection.  I will not bother reading anymore of J&#62;K&#62; Rowling's work.  Low class adjectives are the work of a lazy mind.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I won't bore you with all the in-depth analysis and scrutiny other reviews may give - in short:<br /><br />A bit too long, a bit too much padding.<br />Fantastic conclusion to the trilogy.<br />Bane may be better than the Joker, for his voice and sheer brutality and single-minded focus. Really makes you wonder if he can be stopped.<br />Finally, a decent portrayal of Catwoman in a film. Sorry, Halle.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I follow Agent  Pendergast as I likle the twilsts and turns hils life takes.  The author's have a deep appreciation of detective work and transmit the reader to be involved in his family and frilends.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Had it delivered to my kindle. Need to re read this book as I did not find the characters in the free cities as engaging.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was the most difficult book I've ever read--the most gut-wrenching, painful story I will probably ever read in my life.<br /><br />I closed this book and cried for an hour.<br />That is not an exaggeration, I wish it were. The rating for this book is a very hard one for me. There were parts in this book I hated (not the writing, but the feelings it provoked), and at times I felt it might be better to cut my arm off with a butter knife than to continue reading it...but due to the depths of the raw, vulnerable truth...I have no other option but to rate it a 5.<br /><br />On principal,I almost never rate books that have \\"sex scenes\\", no matter how clean(and Colleen's are very well done...neither explicit nor crude),a 5. But this story gripped my heart, tore it out, smashed it on the sidewalk and then sewed it back into my chest at the end. That kind of connection to a story just doesn't come around every day...or even every decade.<br /><br />Colleen-<br />In this story, you gave a voice to the nearly 30% of women (that we know of, I believe it's more) who have survived some kind of \\"loss of innocence\\" and/or sexual abuse. It takes courage, strength, tenacity and hard-core determination to do what you did in Hopeless. You went to the pit and back in order to deliver the kind of heartache and truth you brought to this story. The emotions, the grit, the pain...were very real and very tangible. Though there was a lot of wonderful creativity to this plot line...the realities of it were devastating.<br /><br />We live in world where many young girls and boys need a rescuer--in a physical sense. Thank you for that reminder. As a survivor, I also want to be a be Karen--a legal one :)<br /><br />Thank you for your story.<br />It has touched my life, and made me \\"feel\\" and remember. We can only heal from what we allow ourselves to process and accept.<br />Love is what brings restoration full-circle.<br /><br />Hard truths:<br /><br />\\"I hate him for instilling awful thingsin my memory and somehow making me grieve for him in the midst of all the awful. I don't want to grieve his loss. I want to rejoice in it, but it's just not in me.\\"<br /><br />\\"There is nothing like the guilt you feel when there's room in your heart to love evil.\\"<br /><br />Amazing words from Holden to Sky:<br /><br />\\"I want you to remember who you are, despite the bad things that are happening to you. Because those bad things aren't you. They are just things that happen to you. You need to accept who you are, and the things that happen to you, are not one and the same.\\"
B00571F26Y|5.0|My life has been changed by this book. A friend suggested that I read it, and within the first few pages, I decided to just give up wheat. Within that same week, I ate a chicken salad from a popular salad restaurant. I started itching around my neck, and then I found out that the restaurant marinates their chicken in a flour based marinade. In the four weeks I've been following the simple plan of eliminate the wheat, I've lost 5lbs, and sleep soundly. Thanks, Dr. Davis for this book!
B009A9BF5G|2.0|I have been collecting Blu Ray music DVDs for a long time and what a disappointment this one was!<br />Video quality is mediocre and audio also not up to Blu Ray standard - certainly the worst in my collection. Compared to the new Lady Antebellum's Blu Ray near perfect quality both in video and audio, I feel this disk was quickly slapped together to make the Xmas season. Many of my normal music DVDs in my collection have much better video quality. This one is very granular and should never have been put on Blu Ray.Camera movement is too jerky and even focus in some areas is slightly out - ColdPlay should have used professionals that know what they are doing.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Two things I liked, hard bodies and the dancing.  Couldn't find anything to care about in the characters, love story sucked, the &#34;kid&#34; needed to be B#*&C slapped.  And there wasn't enough of the hard bodies.  Oh and I hated Matt Mc playing such a slime ball!
B0015AARJI|5.0|When I bought this remote, I got so much love from my boyfriend because he has been wanting a 2nd remote for the longest. When he got it, he was excited. Timing was fast and I love the service that Amazon gives.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The Expendables 2 stopped taking itself on any level of serious unlike in 1, so it was a fun romp.  Will watch it again.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I enjoyed this movie VERY much! One reason is that it evokes the reality of India so well that one feels as though you've been there. Another is that the people are so real, you can recognize your own experiences, and that of friends in them.<br />  The portrayal of the gay person was done so well, not sensationalized---but presented as a reality of life---and death.<br />  The cast was exceptional---such talented STARS!<br />  ---K.M.K. in San Francisco<br /><br />1
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am an avid mystery story reader and anything Michael Connelly writes is okay with me.  He always has a good story line and I have never been disapointed.
B005J6LKVI|3.0|I am glad that I saw this movie; it gives you an insight to situations that I had known little of during those  times.<br />However, This is not necessarily a &#34;feel good&#34; movie. In fact, I found it somewhat depressing at times. Well, I suppose that real life is not always &#34;a bowl full of cherries.&#34;<br />Seeing this movie, one realizes how far we have come in recognizing our shared humanity.<br />  K.M.K. in San Francisco

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I got the demo 1st and got pulled right into the story so when it was time to purchase the full version I didn't even flinch!! I love h.o adventure games and this was one of the best!

1401322786|5.0|\\"A man sits alone in a cave.<br /><br />His hair is long. His beard reaches his knees. He holds his chin in the cup of his hands. He closes his eyes. He is listening to something. Voices. Endless voices. They rise from a pool in the corner of the cave. They are the voices of people on Earth. They want one thing only. Time.<br /><br />Sarah Lemon is one of those voices.<br /><br />A teenager in our day, she sprawls on a bed and studies a photo on her cell phone: a good-looking boy with coffee-colored hair. Tonight she will see him. Tonight at eight-thirty. She recites it excitedly - Eight-thirty, eight-thirty! - and she wonders what to wear. The black jeans? The sleeveless top? No. She hates her arms. Not the sleeveless. \\"I need more time,\\" she says.<br /><br />Victor Delamonte is one of those voices.<br /><br />A wealthy man in his mid-eighties, he sits in a doctor's office. His wife sits beside him. White paper covers an exam table. The doctor speaks softly. \\"There's not much we can do,\\" he says. Months of treatment have worked. The tumors. The kidneys. Victor's wife tries to speak, but the words catch. As if sharing the same larynx, Victor clears his throat. \\"What Grace wants to ask is....how much time do I have left?\\"<br /><br />His words - and Sarah's words - drift up to the faraway cave, and the lonesome, bearded man sitting inside it. This man is Father Time.<br /><br />You might think him a myth, a cartoon from a New Year's card - ancient, haggard, clutching an hourglass, older than anyone on the planet. But Father Time is real. And, in truth, he cannot age. Beneath the unruly beard and cascading hair - signs of life, not death - his body is lean, his skin unwrinkled, immune to the very thing he lords over. Once, before he angered God, he was just another man, fated to die when his days were done. Now he has a different fate: Banished to this cave, he must listen to the world's every plea - for more minutes, more hours, more years, more time.<br /><br />He has been here an eternity. He has given up hope. But a clock ticks for all of us, silently, somewhere. And one is ticking even for him. Soon Father Time will be free. To return to Earth. And finish what he started.\\" (pg 3-4).<br /><br />In The Timekeeper by Mitch Albom, we are immersed in the lives of two people who one man has been asked to intervene and help in their quest for more time in very different aspects of their lives. It takes the reader into their own personal question of what are they doing with time, are they wasting it, do they value it the way they should, and how can they begin to change their seconds and minutes moving forward. There are truly so many things to take away from this book in retrospective and great quotes worth keeping. I know for me, I'll be taking this one out time and time again to make sure I am living my life as it should be, a gift, that's why it's called the present. I would easily rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars and makes the perfect gift for those that wish things were different or as an inspiration to make their lives truly better beginning today!s been here an eternity.

B000IZA9PI|5.0|Tom Hardy plays john Luke's younger clone in this, and let me just say he is sex on a stick. I love all Star Trek movies being I grew up loving the show.  Riker (sp?) character bothers me...but he also did anyways.
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|I did like the more caring, heart felt relationships that Alice was faced with this time.  That aspect added a nice flavor to the story.<br />It was odd to see some of her old friends or duplicates of them, being fought; as least she would have known their strengths and weaknesses.  All in all it was ok.  I bought it and I'll watch it again.  Ended with a pretty nice set-up for the next installment.
B001QVFDA4|5.0|I loved this movie...and I never buy DVD's. So right there is telling you a lot. Tom Hardy and Gerald Butler are such guy's and little boys in this movie. The rest of the cast are awesome. I hope the make a second one like it says at the end of the movie.  The music is awesome in the movie.  The realitionships that the characters have works so well. I would reomend the movie &#34;Snatch&#34; if you like this one.  Seriously you won't be disapointed.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn continues to hold my attention to the Rapp series.  But, I have the feeling the plots are becoming more group oriented instead of the previous practice of following the individual Rapp on his merry way of tracking down the bad guys....
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I really like Rodriguez's music- I had previosly bought Cold Fact which I think is a better album. I would still recommend Coming from Reality to Rodriguez's fans because he only recorded 2 albms.
0553801503|2.0|And I say this as a long time fan of the novels (started back in 2001, before this one came out). Honestly, the first 3 books were written at such an ingenious pace, because GRRM really selected whose stories needed to be told. With such a large, epic world on his hands, he understood which characters truly mattered and the art of \\"not telling\\". Many characters like Petyr Baelish, Cersei, Ser Barristan, the Hound, Brienne, to name a few, seemed so fascinating without ever having to make them central POV characters. And incidentally, those books took less time to write! Now, with Feast of Crows, he's completely thrown that out the window. It seems like every supporting character we ever come across becomes a main one, every single ship ride, journey on horseback, days and days of monotonous detail is written out and it's just BORING. Granted, there are some very compelling storylines here--namely Ariana Martell and The Iron Islands chapters. If this book were just reduced to those chapters, and some of Cersei's (the one about Rhaegar especially--though I hate that she is a POV now), and everything else was thrown out, then this would be a pretty good addition to the series and on pace with how GRRM used to do it. And the fact that he left out Tyrion, Dany and Jon just leads me suspect that this was just filler to begin with.<br /><br />I haven't read Dance of Dragons, because I fear he has lost control of this series...
0062213423|5.0|I read it and its interesting. The boys tell their stories and how the X Factor was for them. I would definitely recommend it.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is so redundant I couldn't bear to read the other two. Don't know what all the hype is about,  the story  was pretty interesting for a while but it just seemed like I was reading the same thing over and over. Good book for horny housewives I guess....

Now I have to opportunity to share them with my grandchildren.<br /><br />This is such a beautiful boxed set which includes 5 wonderful Dr. Suess books.  All of them are hard-covered which fits nicely back in the storage box and decorated any shelf. his is a wonderful self of first readers.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow, this was an excellent read! Near-future hard-science adventure, with a main character who seems completely authentic. It rivals works by much more famous authors; I look forward to reading more of Weir's work.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I guess I should have read a little bit more about this book and the author before reading the book. I am a reader of mysteries and this book was more of a psychological &#34;thriller&#34; than a mystery. The author is very clever in her portrayal of her characters and a good writer, but this book was not my favorite.
B009439HEY|3.0|First of all I'm a huge Genesis and Steve Hackett fan.  But I have mixed feelings about this recording.  The tunes are played and produced extremely well, and I don't mind the voices not being Peter's or Phil's.  I especially like the older takes from Nursery Crymes and the like, where the original recording quality was never state-of-the-art.  The newer Phil-era tracks cover songs that were so well recorded they don't really do much for me.<br /><br />So that's it.  Listening to the older tracks with better sound quality do give a new perspective.  But I have to say, for what it's worth, I would &#60;much&#62; rather that Steve would have spent the time to make this recording on his own, new stuff than rehashing the old.<br /><br />Frankly, the energy and the feel was superior in the old recordings, even if the sound was not.  For example on this recording: the song &#34;Return of the Giant Hogweed&#34;.  The original version was not recorded as well as the new version, but it still has an intensity and power in it's grunge-&#34;enhanced&#34; performance that greatly outshines Steve's new version<br /><br />After the novelty of the first few listens, I just don't understand why this recording was made.

B002ZG99NG|4.0|Ben Affleck continues his good work as director. The blood of a town is in the center of this film.<br />The blu-ray gives a magnificent opportunity to see both version (theatrical or extended). Sound, image and bonus complet certainly a product that can be recommended.

B0076DELIG|4.0|I'm not finished reading it yet, but I really like Connelly's style. I have read almost all of his books, & this one is as good as the others!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is an unusually skillful writer. This is a superbly structured novel with characters who are less than admirable, yet there are insights into the way our minds work in close relationships that strike a chord and force us to perhaps reflect on our own behavior, and the world's behavior, and more deeper examine our lives.This is a rather intellectual view for a book in the mystery/thriller genre, but it's also just a good read. I won't spoil the book by telling what happens in the end, of course, but it's a bit of a surprise. Gillian's books tend to be a bit too...oh...what's the word? Gorey and somewhat too sensationalistic for my taste. That's the only thing I don't like about this book, which is the reason for only 4 stars instead of 5. I'd love to see the  author write a book that was less-dependent on the &#34;sensationally mean&#34; side of life because she has the power and skill to do that and perhaps even produce a literary masterpiece.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Fun and entertaining for a quick read.  Enjoyed it more since it was from the Top Free List.  Would recommend!

B00355L2TU|3.0|I bought these videos because I wanted to try and work out over my winter break--I wasn't expecting miracles in 30 days, but I trusted the name and liked that the videos were only 20-30 minutes so it wouldn't eat up too much time.<br /><br />However, they are a bit too intense for me. I am in pretty bad shape, I am only 20 but I am overweight and I don't exercise very regularly at all. I was only able to get through the first workout for two days--they were pretty hard and I was sore after, but today my knees are in a lot of pain and keep giving out when I walk. I am hoping that the pain will subside in a few days and that I haven't given myself a long term injury. My own fault, I should have gone slower and paid more attention to my form, but still.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-very short<br />-does provide a good workout<br />-exercises are straight forward and easy to follow<br />-good quality videos as far as pace, music, trainer commentary<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-not great for beginners<br />-doesn't spend enough time on each exercise to get the form right<br />-the commentary was very good at encouragement, but I feel like it made it seem like slowing down or modifying the exercises more was entirely unnecessary. Probably to make good on the 30 day claim, but not necessary for just improving overall fitness at a slower pace. Mostly my bad, just be careful not to hurt yourself if you aren't in the best shape.

B009AZZEU2|5.0|Fans of Louder than Love and Badmotorfinger (both awesome albums) probably will not like this, but fans of Superunknown and Down the Upside (underrated album), probably will, but this is like nothing they've ever done before, and I think thats a good thing, I mean sure, the classic albums are excellent...and are still the best, but this album I would call a warm up, I hope, but saying that, I don't mean to take anything away from this album, because it has some great songs on it, but like I said, people that were big fans of the first 2 albums may not, but even then, give it a shot, to me, an album like this, which like I said is completely different than anything they've done in the past, further proves how great of a band Soundgarden was/is, the songwriting is excellent since no songs sound the same, and most of them grab you, and the execution is excellent, this is why Soundgarden were the best band to come out of the grunge era, even topping Alice in Chains, and I love Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and Mother Love Bone, but Soundgarden just had the best line up, Chris Cornell we all know how great he is at his craft, Matt Cameron is a beast on the kit, Kim Thayil really has great chemistry with Cornell, these guys just work so well off each other, and Ben Sheppard has always delivered an excellent bass performance, and what I like, on all the albums, you can hear the bass, it isn't drowned out, and they are all in top form here, they have not lost a thing, I won't do a song by song review, but my favorites are \\"Non-State Actor\\" \\"A Thousand Days Before\\" \\"Blood on the Valley Floor\\" \\"By Crooked Steps\\" \\"Bones of Birds\\" \\"Taree\\" and \\"Rowing\\", \\"Been Away Too Long\\" is good, but I think it's over-hyped, much better songs found on here.<br /><br />And to be warned, do not judge this album on first listen, listen to it 3 or 4 times before you make your final judgement, I didn't care much for it the first listen, but it really grows on you, so give it a chance!
B004PVKFR8|4.0|I bought the album because I loved their single, &#34;Sail.&#34;  I was pleasantly surprised by their other songs.  The other songs don't quite have the same feel as &#34;Sail&#34; but they're pretty good in their own right.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Reading 'The Racketeer' is much like every other Grisham novel I've read. Within a few pages I know it's a good story and read slower and slower to savour the experience and avoid its end. However, by 'mid-book', my reading pace quickens as I become enthralled and eager to discover what Grisham 'surprise' I'll find.

159420411X|2.0|Nate Silver's book is an important introduction to statistical analysis for the average person.  Where it fails is when he delves into areas he doesn't know about: specifically finance.<br /><br />He makes the assumption that bad models caused the 2008 financial crisis and that fixing the models will fix the financial system.  He makes a terrible assumption here.  The wrong assumption is that the models were created in good faith.  Bad models were used not out of ignorance, but because they gamed the system in the ways the banks and ratings agencies wanted them gamed.  The bad models allowed the sale of sure-to-default mortgages as AAA securities.  Anyone holding these securities when the crash came, or anyone who had insured these products (like AIG), would be in trouble when the defaults started.  However, the mortgagors and bankers that sold these loans and securities made their money up front.  And boy did they make it.  Bonuses for mortgage securities brokers, and their senior managers, went through the roof during the pre-crisis years as more and more mortgages were sold and turned into securities for sale to dupes.  The banksters made millions per year selling these dodgy instruments that only looked good because they had \\"models\\" that told us so.  Thus the models were created not out of ignorance but out of criminally fraudulent inducement.  These same banksters didn't really care if the banks they worked for went bust when the crisis hit because they had already made their tens and hundreds of millions in bonuses.  The fact that they call got bailed out by the taxpayers was certainly a happy fact for them and did serve to increase their ill-gotten gains, but was not necessary for their crimes to succeed:  the crimes had succeeded by the time the public became aware of the problem in '08 (as an aside, the Fed and other \\"regulators\\" had been suppressing the crisis since early 2007 with quiet emergency bailouts and other mechanisms hoping to outrun the '08 election before the public became aware.  As we know, they were not able to do this, which in the end didn't really matter as our government bailed out the criminals just the same under the democrat as it would've under a republican).<br /><br />Anyhow, Nate Silver ascribes simple bad math to a problem that is much greater and involves real criminality, not just ignorance of statistical modeling, and that is an egregious error.  In fact, Silver should've stuck to the areas of his expertise: sports and political polling, and avoided the generalizations and over-confidence he criticizes in other statisticians by applying his knowledge in naive ways.ction before the public became aware.

B0052UYJDC|5.0|Francine Jay has thoughtful and clear insights into making some great changes. I am so glad she wrote the book and that I read it. It is one I will share and read again.
0061726834|5.0|Lauren Oliver really knows how to write a good book.Delirium with the whole 441 pages was really good. The whole plot was exciting, yet I wonder why she would choose Portland as her city. All of the events in the book seemed to roll smoothly, and the places where described with great detail. You could easily tell what kind of place 37 Brooks was. I could imagine myself there seeing everything happen. When Lauren described the scene when Lena goes into the ward six inside of the crypts, the detail seemed to roll like a movie that was going on before my eyes.  I loved how i could somehow put myself in Lena's situation of despair when she found out about her mother. The whole structure of the book was long but it seemed i was flying through the pages because it was so interesting. I had read these type of books before where the author writes about futuristic cities, and that there secrets that change the main characters life forever. For example in The Giver by Lois Lowry and Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, they both seem to make you think between the lines and make you get the feeling of doubt that in the near future something like this can actually happen. Every time I read the book I wanted to have a little piece of romance between Alex and Lena in every chapter. Their relationship to me was like nothing that you see these days anymore.  The book was over all very entertaining. I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I found it engaging and fun, and peculiarly satisfying.  Don't pay any attention to the recent Sunday NY Times review;  she obviously didn't get it.  This book is a mystery, a puzzle, a contemporary and old-time lifestyle commentary and sort of reminded me of Sherlock Holmes, for some reason.  It appeals to young and old alike (and the protagonists are both) and just carries you along!  Thoroughly enjoyable!

This is one of the leading processors today, coupled with my asrock motherboard, I can clock this jewel at 4.4ghz with no heat or stability issues and it will power any game I've thrown at it with ease.  Overclocking gives extra assistance to the video card (GTX 670) to give it an extra 20 or so fps verses the stock 3.6ghz speed.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|5++ stars!! One of best books of 2012!<br /><br />Hopeless utterly blew me away. It was the kind of book that makes me want to stand on a rooftop and shout how amazing it is to the whole world! Beautiful, heart-wrenching and uplifting.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's writing is absorbing, captivating, and flows so smoothly you barely feel the pages slipping by.<br /><br />After just reading the prologue, I. Was. Hooked.  and I just knew that I had to put my life on hold until I finished it. It gives you a taste of where the story is headed and just grabs at your heart in a way that makes you just NEED to know more.<br /><br />When Sky meets Holder, her life changes. He is the first guy to make her heart skip a beat. The first guy to really make her FEEL.<br /><br />\\"I've never been swept off my feet. I don't get butterflies. In fact the whole idea of being swooned by anyone is foreign to me... Somehow, in the course of sixty seconds, this guy has managed to swoon me, then terrify the hell out of me.\\"<br /><br />Dean Holder was absolutely amazing. With just a touch of bad boy, lickable dimples, a crooked smile and a tattoo, this moody, mysterious and endearing hot guy with a temper just utterly stole my heart.<br /><br />\\"I saw a guy at the store after school, and holy s***, Six. He was beautiful. Scary, but beautiful....as soon as I looked at him, it was like my entire body melted to the floor. He was... Wow.\\"<br /><br />Deeply protective and totally swoony but with a bad rep, he was so contradictory - warm, cold. Sweet, sharp. Just like Sky, I just NEEDED to know more about him. And the more I learned, the more the mystery deepened.<br /><br />I loved watching them get closer and closer. Their chemistry was undeniable and their dialogue and banter was rapid fire and brilliant and just set my heart a flutter.<br /><br />What they had was intense, passionate, and oh-so REAL. Every single thing they went though and did was believable and just made you wish you knew them in person.<br /><br />I loved that the story was serious but little parts made me laugh out, breaking up the more emotionally charged scenes. I swooned, squeed, proclaimed my undying love for the book, and had to take breathers to wipe the tears that sprung up on me more than once.<br /><br />I felt so in sync with Sky's emotions and journey. I felt like I went through all her emotions without ever once feeling disconnected. Through her eyes, I fell in love with Holder, I felt her pain and confusion, and I felt her healing. She was a wonderfully strong, brave heroine - the kind you want to look up to and make you feel proud of.<br /><br />This book has the. most. beautiful. intense. breathtaking. first kiss. EVER. (without actually kissing). Curious? You'll have to read it and see. But I am not kidding, it was one of the best written kisses I've ever read!<br /><br />I loved that the story was emotionally charged but with absolutely no stupidity. All the characters' reactions were understandable and just made me more and more sympathetic to them. This isn't to say that there wasn't angst and heart-clutching turmoil, because there was. The subject matter and themes are serious, gut wrenching and very mature. This book is definitely 17+.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.\\"<br /><br />I have to say that I didn't see the big reveal coming. I had my suspicions about one part of the story, but the other part totally took me by surprise.<br /><br />All the pieces of the story just build and build, layer upon layer of things you don't even realize are important until the secrets come out and the cascade of emotions from them just crash into you and take your breath away.<br /><br />\\"Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\\"<br /><br />This is a quite simply a beautiful story about love and survival. About hope and healing. About life and death. About coping with tragedy and finding forgiveness and peace. About being strong. About being a victim, but also a survivor.<br /><br />I honestly do not have one single complaint about this book. I have entire pages of my copy highlighted. Its THAT good.<br /><br />Every word, every sentence, every scene puts the imagery of the story into your head so vividly that you feel as though you are right there, watching the events unfold.<br /><br />This book NEEDS to be made into a movie!!<br /><br />This is one of those stories that will stay with you forever.<br /><br />And yes, there is a HEA :)<br /><br />\\"F**k all the firsts, Sky. The only thing that matters to me with you are the forevers.\\"I honestly do not have one single complaint about this book. I have entire pages of my copy highlighted. Its THAT good.

B009FZFONO|5.0|After a middling and plodding second season the zombie killers returned in major fashion. Without spoiling anything the writers weren't afraid to kill off characters and gave us a glipse of the depraved Governor.  While it's somewhat following the comic book with respect to characters, the twists and turns introduced into the TV show are welcome changes and I'm looking forward to the second part of season 3.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|“The Dark Knight Rises” is by far the very best Batman movie to date, which says a lot, because “The Dark Knight” was incredible! “The Dark Knight Rises” continues to maintain the darkness that epitomizes good ‘Batman’ movies, but this one is full of more twists and turns than in previous ‘Batman’ movies. Furthermore, the ending was NOT predictable and we finally meet ‘Robin’. Yes, it can be a little sappy & syrupy, but it's a story based on a dark hero from a comic book. At least it's not as corny as a ‘Superman’ movie. I cannot figure out where the next ‘Batman’ movie is going to go. There are so many changes in this movie. Future ‘Batman’ movies will have to establish a new base, new toys, new setting, new bad guys/girls, new good guys/girls. I have no doubt that Christopher Nolan already has a story in process that will out-do “The Dark Knight Rises”. The man is a film genius!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|There back!!! And believe me, if u liked the first movie then your going to love this one even more, its a fun movie to watch, the acting is bit campy but nothing to bore u, this movie has lots going on plus a few \\"New Old Faces\\" to add more to the film, the oneliners kinda add the Salt n Pepper to the mix and it makes for a goodtime fun film.......

B009VB97EY|3.0|If you want to see great men's bodies in dancing action, this is the movie for you, but don't expect a cinematic masterpiece.  It had a sweet plot, where the aging male stripper falls for a protégé's sister, but waiting for her to smile was an exercise in frustration.  The other male actors were nice eye candy so it wasn't a complete waste.  But if you're expecting more than a couple of hours of mindless entertainment, you'll be disappointed.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|If you check the 1-star reviews for this product, then you will notice something that I unfortunately did not notice until *after* I had bought the product.<br /><br />Starting from August 2012 (but with spikes for November and December), you'll notice that all of the 1-star reviews are for the same thing -- the product arrives with a dead battery.<br /><br />I bought my E6 on November 18th (although it has taken me this long to write this review), and immediately upon opening it, I noticed a few things.<br /><br />a) The device does not turn on unless it is plugged in via USB to something else.<br />b) When plugged in via USB, the red LED blinks rapidly.<br /><br />I did not pay any attention to this at first, but thought that this was a sign that it needed charging, and that's all I needed to do.<br /><br />What I realized was that no matter how much charging I would do, as soon as I unplugged the E6 from USB, it would shut off.<br /><br />As you can see from other reviews, a red blinking LED is a sign of a dead battery.<br /><br />I don't have an E6 with a working battery, so I don't have anything to compare with, but it appears that when it is plugged in, the E6 will still work. Here, I will say this: I am not an audiophile, but I wasn't totally impressed by the E6. (Although since it is my first portable amp, I guess I can't complain with the price.) The red light and blue light EQ settings appear to muddy up the sound (whereas they are supposed to boost bass.)<br /><br />I have heard that this amp is simply not powerful enough to power the IEMs that I have (the Hifiman RE-262), so I will probably look for something else to replace this. For other IEMs and headphone, perhaps this will be a better product.

1451696205|3.0|Maybe I had too high of expectations given the popularity of this novel, but I thought it read like an afterschool special. Drugs and alcohol, abortion, abuse (of all kinds), mental illness, gay bullying, etc. etc. Also thought the narrator's prose was overly naive and simplistic given his age, life experiences and supposed brilliance. One really good and memorable line (&#34;we felt infinite&#34;) can't carry the whole story. A fast read, but nothing great.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|This season is completely different and is uncomfortably creepy.  I loved the 1st season.  It was suspenseful and<br />mysterious and had a  great story.  I prefer the 1st season story line.

B008G8SFGO|3.0|I am a long time KISS fan. I go back to the 70's with this band and love a lot of what they do. I still have the 45 of Detroit Rock City in my collection. That being said, this album feels like they kind of phoned it in. When you compare it to the really bad stuff from the 80's it is a good album but compared to their best it is pretty much \\"Eh\\". It doesn't suck but it is by no means a ground breaking or earth shattering effort from the band. Keep in mind I really liked the last album Sonic Boom and love things like Revenge as well as the classics like Destroyer, Love Gun, KISS, and Dressed to Kill. This album is one that is good to fill out a catalog if you are trying to maintain a complete collection but if you are a serious KISS fan don't expect to be blown away by it. Even knowing that though, if you get a chance go see them on tour you should go. KISS can make even the most mundane seem awesome on stage. One thing that should be on everyone's bucket list is to see KISS live at least once in their life.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the third book in the series.  Like the other two, the book is set in Sweden.  It is full of incredible detail, but is not at all boring.  The detail is necessary for developing the characters and setting the scene for an amazing set of complicated intrigues.  I thought Sweden was a peaceful place!  It is a crime drama of the first order.  I literally could not put this book down until I had finished it!  Nothing got in my way, not dinner, not work, not sleep!  It is a substantial book and took almost 2 days to finish reading.  Unfortunately, the author died shortly after submitting the three manuscripts so no further books with these characters will be forthcoming.

B0098TL4YU|5.0|Jimi never ceases to amaze me as well as his Fans. Whether it's in the studio or live. From his early days with the legendary Rock band Survivor, to his hand penned theme song for the syndicated TV show Bay Watch, which he also was the voice/singer. Also songs in movies for the likes of Sylvester stallone to God only knows what else, Jimi consistantly produces when it comes to songwriting combined with one of the worlds most distinct voices known today. I applaud Jimi and would hope he continues to entertain all of us for many more years. From the sound of this latest album, I truely believe he will. My hats off, once again, to Brother Jimi Jamison & Family. Thank you. Respectfully submitted, &#34;Chuck&#34; Charles E. Compton Sr.

0321857895|4.0|As someone who has taken visual notes for decades, it is fun to see someone pulling together lots of advice and celebrating the \\"art\\" that is often the result. The audience for this work ranges from the veteran meeting doodler who wants permission to go further to the skilled pen-jockey who might actually be asked to share her notes. Beginners may be intimidated into thinking they have to buy special supplies and do advance preparations. If you are pressing yourself to do more visual note-taking to enhance your comprehension and to make your notes easier to use afterwards, then just do it on your usual yellow pad with your usual cheap pen. You can still be inspired by this book.<br /><br />For the aspiring visual note-taker, a couple bits of advice are missing. (1) Have respect for the room and for the presenter or meeting facilitator. Showing up with your Moleskine and your set of colorful gel pens will, WILL draw attention to you and what you're doing. (2) The best part of visual note-taking is what happens when your mind makes new connections branching away from the topic at hand. Capturing these associations can be the most profound and long-lasting benefit of this multi-modal approach. You're trying not to be a slave to text, so also unchain yourself from the presenter's bullet points. Let some mind-mapping happen.<br /><br />I read the Kindle edition that was available on 19 Dec 2012. Take note that every page is a .jpg and takes a few beats to load. It also means you can't highlight text.<br /><br />The author claims that each page is \\"lovingly hand-sketched\\" but I found that disingenuous. The lovely text is clearly a computer font, perhaps based on the author's own hand. Maybe this is why the author refers to hand-lettering as \\"typography\\" or \\"type.\\" Do humans draw \\"type\\" these days? Am I \\"hand-sketching\\" if I use a handwriting font on my computer?
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I read all the glowing reviews of this book and was slightly disappointed.  It was a good read but felt slightly lacking.  I guess I was hoping the stories would be more linked or intertwined similar to Roboapocalypse.  I will admit that I have high expectations when I pay almost $12 for a digital copy of a book.
0061784788|3.0|I am normally a big fan of James Rollins and his Sigma Force Novels but this one I didn't speed through with my usual voraciousness.  I started it and found myself often a little lost between the nano techology/nano nests, the native american and Lewis & Clark references and the skipping back and forth between different areas and countries.  Maybe it was just me, I just found it hard to focus on the entire story and have a really good sense of exactly what was going on. I did enjoy the the characters, but as I said, I wasn't as connected with this novel as I had been on his previous books.<br /><br />The book starts with a cave that is found to have some artifacts and mummified bodies, which are presumed by the local Native Americans to belong to their people. When a camera crew and a militant Native American group are on site things get out of hand and a riot ensues, one of the members being a distant relation to Painter Crowe, Director of Sigma Force.  The novel takes you through several areas in the US & a few countries as strange geothermal disturbances seem to be taking place that are related to this site and an artifact that is found there.  From here, the story takes turns in describing the founding fathers and how they had been influenced by the Natives and that there was a lost 14th colony, known as the Devil Colony.  More comes to light as the Lewis & Clark expedition also plays into current events.<br /><br />I didn't dislike the book, I just felt that it was very busy in the plot area and the nano technology honestly loses me (much as the space time continuum does in Sci Fi novels and movies)....it's probably just me.<br /><br />Overall, if you read all of the Sigma novels, you will enjoy visiting Painter, Grayson Pierce, Kat & Monk and the other recurring characters.
B005C4MRAA|4.0|The narrator of The Rainmaker is Rudy Baylor, a law school student at Memphis State, who runs into a string of bad luck in his final year of school.  His girlfriend dumped him for a preppie with the accursed initial as a first name.  Baylor was evicted from his apartment, and a process-server delivered a summons for him to answer to a debt from Texaco.  His job at Broadnax & Speer was eliminated when the partners of that firm sold out to Tinley Britt, an exclusive white-shoes law firm with more lawyers whose first name begins with an initial.  Rudy talked himself into a job as a paralegal by offering the carrot of a case, only to find out that his so-called boss never really had the position to give in the first place.  The aforementioned boss then insisted that the case now belonged to the law firm that had no room for Rudy Baylor.<br /><br />A desperate Rudy took a job with a disreputable lawyer who sent Baylor on ambulance-chasing missions.  The lawyer running that firm resolved some personal legal problems that ensnared Rudy and allowed Rudy to pass the bar exam.  Even that job quickly ended when the feds busted Bruiser Stone.<br /><br />Baylor formed his own practice with Deck Shifflet, an odd-faced egg who is practical at chasing down business.  The author, John Grisham, introduced the reader to another aspect of the legal world - a new lawyer opening his own practice.  Baylor was one of the lucky ones, as he had two hot leads as prospective clients, as well as an employee who seemed to enjoy hustling for clients.  One client is a lonely widow named Miss Birdie who asks Baylor to redo her will, one that doles out an estate of more than $20 million to various beneficiaries.  Another is the bad-faith suit against the Great Benefit Life Insurance Company proposed by Dot and Buddy Black, a couple with a son dying of leukemia.  Their son Ronnie Ray would have been saved had the insurance company forked over the money for a bone marrow transplant.  His twin brotherwas a willing and able donor, but Great Life stalled, and denied the claim eight different times until it was too late for an operation to save Ronnie Ray.<br /><br />Through the Black case, the reader also learns about the thin legal line that some fly-by-night insurance firms tow.  A bad-faith claim is one presented by a client who is denied even though the claim is covered by the insurance contract.<br /><br />Grisham grew up in a small town across the border from Memphis in Mississippi.  A web site for the city of Memphis promotes Grisham as a tourist attraction.  This story occurs primarily in Memphis, and there is no shortage of colorful characters or establishments.  Many of these interesting characters have benevolent side to their personalities.  Prince Thomas, who employed Rudy Baylor at his bar named Yogi's, should also be included as one of the colorful characters in the novel.  Both Prince and his friend Bruiser were rumored to be involved in strip clubs, illegal businesses, and money laundering.<br /><br />With all of his troubles, Rudy Baylor is an engaging narrator who unwittingly became the underdog in a David and Goliath courtroom struggle.  His antagonist is a behemoth law firm representing a disreputable client.  Both sets of antagonists, the firm and the client, are as easy to root against as it is to side with the underdog.  The story may not have a happily-ever-after ending but Grisham keeps it real.

B009D0LBRO|5.0|I love Rayman Origins.  I actually got the platinum trophy for it on the Playstation Vita because I finished every little thing I possibly could.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this mobile game, as it is similar to Origins, but unique.<br /><br />Rayman never stops running - you just control when he jumps and punches.  It simplifies things for the mobile platform, but allows enough flexibility to keep the levels challenging.<br /><br />I enjoyed this game enough that I finished all 40 levels, including the extra-hard Death levels.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes platforming games.

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a novel of historical fiction set during the holocaust.  The story has many layers that bring out many emotions in the reader.  The narrator of the story is Death.  Who better to be narrator during a time of death and loss than Death himself?  Death describes each journey to pick up souls as a different color, such as red, white, and black. The theme of the story is how words can have power.  This novel includes the description of the deep hatred the Nazis showed towards the Jews. It fills the heart with horror.  Zusak really brings out the different sides and feelings of the Second World War, including the good that came out in some people. \\"Sometimes people are beautiful, not in looks, not in what they say, just in what they are,\\"says Markus Zusak.  The Book Thief has won several awards such as the 2007 Book Sense Children`s Pick List and the 2006 School Library Journal Best Book of the Year.  It has sold over two million copies.  Markus Zusak has written other novels such as, I Am the Messenger, When Dogs Cry, and Underdog.<br /><br />  Liesel is sent by her Jewish mother to live with a safer foster mother and father, Rosa and Hans Hubbermann in Germany.  Most of the novel takes place on a dark, sullen street in Germany. Liesel and her foster mother and father are poor, but rich in the love and care that they show for one another. Rosa Hubbermann, although she won`t easily admit it, truly loves her husband and foster daughter.  Most people who first meet her think of her as a stubborn, acid tongued woman, but her bark is worse than her bite. Hans Hubbermann is a kind, but firm man. Hans can sometimes be the jokester of the bunch. Whenever told something, it goes in one ear and out the other. He teaches Liesel to read and write. You will mostly find him rolling cigarettes, and playing the accordion. Max, a Jewish young man, hides in the basement and becomes another friend. Max is a polite, timid man. Liesel is a very sharp, intelligent child who shows a love for books.  Liesel finds that reading books transports her away from the horrors she`s living in.  She discovers her first book, The Gravedigger`s Handbook, at a graveyard, where her younger brother is buried.  Liesel meets Rudy, an anxious boy, who becomes Liesel's best friend and who leads Liesel into all sorts of fun mischief.  They also see dark, disturbing things. Some of the events they witness can be petrifying. Throughout the book, Liesel goes on trying to get her hands on books.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story for people who are interested in novels set in the Holocaust.  It is a book that can be read by older teens to adults because it does not focus on the gruesome details of the Holocaust, although the Holocaust is always lingering in the background. The story is mostly about a young girl surviving the time period of the Holocaust and books become the key to survival for her. Markus Zusak uses deep imagery about the setting and characters. For example Death says \\"Whoever named Himmel Street (Heaven Street) had a healthy sense of humor, not that it was a living heck, but sure as heck wasn`t heaven.\\" Although Markus Zusak adds a pinch of humor here and there, the majority of the story is gloomy and takes place in a dark time.  Markus Zusak takes death and turns it into a person with a strange sense of humor.  Before The Book Thief came out, Markus Zusak thought, \\"No one is going to read this.\\"  The New York Times comments, \\"Brilliant and hugely ambitious... It`s the type of story that can be LIFE CHANGING.\\"<br /><br />The Book Thief is a touching story about the power of words for good and evil.  This is also a story about the wonderful way a young girl copes with the hardships she is born into.  This novel will steal the reader`s heart in a way never expected. Zusak keeps the story spiraling downward, but keeps you holding on waiting for redemption. If you like The Book Thief, then you`ll like Diary of Anne Frank, and I Am the Messenger.
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|There's nothing really special in this film. However, watching Willis, Freeman, and Malkovich in a single film is just enough.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I began reading the series almost one year ago when Kindle had a $,99 offer on the first book. I have now read every book in the series. This one does not disappoint - great reading. Just sad that I have to wait for Connelly's next H.B. book.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 4 kids love this game.  They range from ages 4 to 14, boy and girls.  They find the game very manageable to play and easy to understand.  I only wish I could find more games that they liked as much as this one!!
034580404X|4.0|what needs to be said about these three books???<br />i think everyone has either read them or, at least, heard about them.<br /><br />i enjoyed reading them.<br /><br />definately NOT recommended for up tight &#34;prudes&#34;<br />(or maybe they would want to read them!!!)
B008RZF2I0|5.0|\\"Mind-blowing\\" is not even close to being the correct phrase to describe this album, but it will have to do. New vocalist Tommy brings something different to this amazing band--anyone who held reservations about it joining should stop now. He sounds gorgeous! Thomas Youngblood outdid himself, lyricly speaking, while the band as a whole really shine.<br /><br />I couldn't, even if I wanted to, pick out a single song that is a \\"must hear\\"--because every track is a \\"must hear\\"! Still, if you have doubts, give \\"Sacrimony\\" or \\"Veritas\\" a listen. You'll be glad you did.
B009YU9J0E|5.0|I've been listening to this almost nonstop since I bought it.  There is not one song that I don't love!
B00A77II0U|4.0|if u r used to playing hidden object games i would recommend playing the more difficult version of this game.  it is a really good game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My Grandchildren and nieces have read these books and it held their interest.  Some violence but nothing outrages.  Certainly not as bad as what's on TV these days.
B005S9EK1S|4.0|i like Zac Efron. Movie was interesting. He plays quiet silent type. Digital copy went on ultraviolet, easy download/access mobile or computer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie.  Less graphic than the book but I can't wait tho see the other two movies in the series.  Hope they are out soon.
0802473156|5.0|This book is wonderful. I cannot speak highly enough about it. It really opens your eyes to the reason why people get divorced. I truly believe if your partner does not fulfill your love languages it is a primary reason you will or did get a divorce. I bought the book to help with my relationship and it takes two people to understand what you are doing and how to fix things. Ive tried counseling with dismal results and found this book to be a much better DIY counseling service. I have recommended to several people, and i don't recommend things unless i really believe in them. It saved our relationship. If your relationship is already long over, this is still a great book for you to read, you may realize what it takes to make a long lasting relationship in your future relationships and set you up for success!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Cannot wait to see the movie.  I saw the Hunger Games and cannot wait for the other two to come out.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A bit too fictional, but none the less great writing. Perhaps his most unbelievable work, but the research is always there.
B00377E5SG|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I have watched this so many times. It's a great chic flick. It's clean with no added swear words, nudity or sex scenes, just a really sweet movie. And how can you lose with Harrison Ford?
B0017HEX76|1.0|Chinese? Really? I'm sorry I bought it. This post asks for 13 words from me. That's all I have to say.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|***** 5 BREATHTAKING STARS *****<br /><br />\\"F- all the firsts, Sky. The only thing that matters to me with you are the forevers.\\"  -Dean Holder<br /><br />((( Insert heart melting here )))<br /><br />SLAMMED is my favorite read, so imagine my excitement with the early release of Hoover's latest work: Hopeless, and holy goodness -  this was just.... LIVE. No, wait. Even better: LOVE.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover does it again with this AMAZING story of love, healing, and forgiveness.  The plot is a beautiful symphony of orchestrated details woven into an intricate web that explodes into twists and turns that had me laughing, swooning, and gasping; causing me to desperately turn each page to find out what happens next.<br /><br />This is one of those books you will stay up all-night to read! (although remember to take those \\"Chapter breaks\\" too)<br /><br />Sky and Holder are true kindred spirits and their story of love is so powerful. We are taken on the journey of Sky's growth and bravery as she faces the truth of her painful past with the unwavering support of Holder (swoon!). I appreciated the straight-forward, witty, and often comical dialogue that these two have - cutting out the game of beating around the bush allowing them to deal with real and heavy issues head-on with an amazing bravado, that although fiction, we can all learn from. This is not a typical \\"romance\\". There is no fluff here. Each scene/chapter/dialogue had a significant purpose and role in the overall story-line - a trait that I appreciate in Hoover's writing.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book....THIS IS YOUR NEXT READ!!! You will not be disappointed!!!
0811879542|5.0|Every child should have this book. It's an interactive book.<br />Absolutely wonderful. There's really no age limit on this book.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I purchased this DVD for my Granddaught for Christmas . As I have never seen it myself I can't be sure but I recieved it in a timely manner and the DVD was in very good condition.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|I am having problems online or off with my bible.  It keeps saying &#34;problems connecting to server&#34;.  This is a problem when I want to read offline.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Not the best movie ever, but very enjoyable. The 3D is spectacular and the sound is very good quality. Loads of extra's. And the blu-rays are region free! (though the box states otherwise).
0762445262|4.0|The item it's really small but it has a great light. The batman signal is very clear. The shipping was fast and the realization of the order went smoothly with no problems.<br />I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine which is a huge Batman fan and he loved it, he found the book very amusing and advises people to buy it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Waited a long time for this book to appear and I wasn't dissappointed characters have developed nicely looking foward to the next in line
B0000C1HLF|5.0|One of the many gifts I've ordered for Christmas. Fast & easy shipping, & great price! All the old & new movies are easy to find!
0061433055|4.0|I have loved reading about Tiffany Aching  in the imaginative and intriguing Faery series by Terry Pratchett even if I am way past being a &#34;young adult'.  In my opinion, this was the last book of the series because it felt as if the author had spun out the character in his imagination.  I was still really happy to have another chance to spend time with Tiffany, and would give the novel another half a star if it were possible.
B007JNR4XW|3.0|I was a little disappointed there wasn't more dancing in this movie.  I was expecting more, but it still wasn't bad and Channing Tatum is a good dancer, here again, I would have liked to have seen more.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I've seen the movie twice would love to see it again.  The read is even more special....more details offered....highly recommend
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Really cool and very convenient. I use it for pictures. Instead of plugging my phone in I can just do it wireless.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I stumbled across this book and I am so glad I did- it has become one of my favourites. I travelled every mile with Harold and wished him success on his journey. It was a poignant yet uplifting tale that Rachel Joyce took her readers on. All the contemplatations Harold took, we took too. A lovely read.
1454701250|4.0|Interesting book I happened upon while looking for something else.  I picked it up, but haven't used it yet.  I hope to do so in the very near future. This does look like a nice little craft book.
B009KHBDUU|5.0|As usual Tim Burton has done it again.  It was worth a second watch.  Johnny Depp was great as usual in the movie.  The movie needs to be watched without disturbance from the outside, some of the phrases that came up were off the wall, but with my sense of humor, I got it.  Well worth renting and watching over.
082300659X|4.0|As a beginner/intermediate drawing student I was looking for books to add to my library to provide additional tutelage besides my drawing classes.  I have not used enough to determine how beneficial it will be.  However, I have found the classical approach very interesting and look forward to watching the accompanying DVD.  The approach is quite different than what I learned in class, which emphasizes some of the skills from &#34;Drawing on the Right Side of the brain.&#34;  Rather than relearning how to see and visualize your subject, &#34;Classical Drawing&#34; uses more mathematical formulas to obtain a final result.  I will have to use the book more to determine how constructive it will be for my development of skills.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Any Trekkie that doesn't have this collection isn't really a Trekkie.  No matter if you think The Motion Picture is worse than Number 5 or vice-versa, you still gotta have the set.  Great image of the box, and the movies are, well, I really don't need to say, do I?
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Once I started watching the series on DVD I was committed to purchasing each new season as it is released.  Warning:  the series is highly addictive and once you start it is like eating peanuts - you can't stop.  The acting is superb, the writing and plot twists mesmerizing and it is easily one of the best shows on TV (along with Homeland - another addictive series).  It is especially nice to watch without ads to break the momentum of the story.  How great to see the next episode immediately rather than having to wait a week to watch live on TV!  This is another series that is worth owning for the extra features and to re-watch episodes to catch what you missed first time around.  The details are so compelling that I find it brings back memories of the 60's from my childhood that I had forgotten - the kids watching their parents at cocktail parties, the clothing, the &#34;feel&#34; of everything, including the music, the omnipresent cigarettes, everything!  I especially love the treatment of historic events such as the Kennedy assassination, and how the story line is integrated into the character's lives in such a realistic way.  Beautifully done.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator is awesome.I use it to do my math homework and it works great on my kindle fire. if u want a good calculator this is it
B0053O89YM|5.0|As a lawyer I find it difficult to watch lawyer shoes on tv.  The Good Wife is the exception:  wonderful writing, superb acting, and exceptional plot developments.  It is simply addictive and intelligent!  It is a pleasure to see a series that manages to keep its edge and the viewer's attention season after season and not lose its focus.  That is why I love the series and keep watching.  This a bargain at any price and one that I will watch over again to catch things that I missed first time around.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|IT DOES IT'S JOB BUT WISH I HAD CHECKED OUT THE COVER WITH THE KEYBOARD ATTACHED.  HARD TO HOLD ONTO.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I watched the show and enjoyed it but this was a gift to someone who loved the series.  They were thrilled that they could re-watch the episodes and enjoy the extra features.  Terrific holiday present!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|this game is very fun and very enjoyable for kids. My kids live they always want to go on it.
B00756GRUE|4.0|This is DEFINITELY a man's watch... The case and bracelet together make this a heavy piece, but just enough to be noticeable on the wrist. The color on the bezel (the black and blue) make this icy cool, but not by any means a gaudy standout statement - just enough as if to say &#34;hey, I'm just as expensive looking as the bank-breakers, but a hell of a lot more better looking... And its a Seiko, so its got its own brand of following...
B009HEMW4W|4.0|Loved this movie.  This movie is great and has the comedy we expect from Will Smith. This is a great addition to the Men In Black set.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|As usual Harry is relentless in his pursuit of justice and his superiors are typically gutless. Despite their lack of support Harry presses on and there are lots of twists and turns to keep the reader enthralled. What starts out as a cold case soon evolves into a live expose of corrupt former soldiers. At times the narrative was a little slow and I would have liked to know Detective Mendenhall's motives for following Harry when she did. This was never explained fully but perhaps it is fodder for the next Harry Bosch?<br /><br />I also enjoyed witnessing the developing adult relationship between Harry and his teenage daughter who is wise beyond her years one moment and refreshingly adolescent at other times. It was interesting to see the impact she has on Harry's decisons, both work-related and in his private life. Will we see future books about Maddie, the FBI recruit?
B00943SQCI|3.0|This movie is a bit of an off beat comedy, at least I think so. I would not give it a rave review. But, I do like t he movie, it just is not over the top.

B009G7ZYPY|4.0|This is a much better Susan Boyle album since her very first one.  Although I didn't like &#34;Somewhere Over The Rainbow&#34; rendition the rest of the album is good.  Especially the Duet with Michael Crawford singing &#34;The Music of the Night&#34; from Phantom of the Opera.  Susan has a very pleasent voice.  We need to hear more songs from her.

B00871C09S|5.0|Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr are wonderful in this Alfred Hitchcock movie.  Full of suspense It keeps you on the edge of your seat from begining to end.  This is for all the Hitchcock movie lovers.
B003UESJF6|5.0|We love watching this movie at home. It never gets old and I can't wait to watch it over and over again.
B00028HBKC|4.0|I would give the movie 5 stars if it was in English. I'm not a fan of having to read subtitles. I don't mind it for a few minutes in a movie, but do not like having to read them the whole time. The movie itself was very good and the acting was great. A couple of the scenes can be tough to watch depending on how you handle certain graphics. Definitely recommend for Christians as it gives you a great visual of what Jesus went through and how painful it must have been.

B008JFUTT0|5.0|As an American living in Cape Town, South Africa, some of my SA friends asked me if I've ever heard of the musical artists named, \\"Rodriguez.\\"  When I answered, \\"No, never heard of him\\" they took me to watch this film without saying another word...I was blown away.  Just watch it!

B000VOC90Y|5.0|You can shove almost anything in this and it'll still close.  Pockets galore.  Most of all, I love the top, zippered compartment next to the handle.  It's as deep as my hand and when traveling will hold all of your important travel documents, phone/glasses/wallet when going through airport security, and everything is easy to get to.  The best backpack I've ever owned.  Now, if I can just find a carry on piece of luggage that is as versatile and will hold tons of stuff, my travel accessory quest would be complete.

B0095VP8D4|5.0|I've used this CPU along with an ASRock Mini-ITX motherboard in order to build a cheap and low profile HTPC machine that can also play games. Not regretting it one bit. This processor can handle all modern games at medium to high settings at 30-60+ fps (some games can be played maxed out at 60+fps, like Valve's source games). If you're building an HTPC and you want it to be low profile as well as play games, this processor is your best bet because you save a lot of space/heat on the GPU too.<br /><br />Word of advice when getting this processor: get the fastest RAM possible, and possibly overclock it too. Since the APU depends on regular RAM for the graphics, when the RAM is fast, the graphics performance becomes noticeably faster.<br /><br />The stock cooler isn't great, but isn't bad either. The main cooling issue I'm getting at the moment has to do with the VRM's on the motherboard (so this is not the fault of the processor).<br /><br />I haven't overclocked this processor yet, but I'm planning to at some point once I sort out my motherboard cooling issue.

0060557818|5.0|A wonderful fantasy about an imaginary London that lurks below our everyday life, it's also a powerful meditation on the alienation of people living a modern life, our addiction to things instead of experiences, and the casual we we ignore those who are not as lucky as we may be.  Oh, and it is also wildly entertaining, vivid and compelling fiction with characters that are difficult to forget.

B007REV4T8|4.0|Bond (played by Daniel Craig) is back in the third installment of the refresh to this franchise with a focus on his age as a \\"00\\" and recovering from an almost lethal gunshot to the chest. There's a lot of focus as well on Bond's relationship with his surrogate mother, \\"M\\" (played by Judi Dench), as well as the most detailed Bond movie about our tarnished hero's background (though the novels did speak in depth of his past).<br /><br />In this tale the higher ups are thinking about shelving \\"M\\" and they're wondering if the \\"00\\" agents are even necessary in the high tech age. One particular high up is Gareth Mallory, played by Ralph Fiennes, who suggests to Bond this is a job for younger men. Something he doesn't want to hear and surely not the audience which makes Mallory a jerk for a good part of the story. But then an old contact to \\"M\\" shows up and he's a cyberterrorist coming after MI6 and \\"M\\" especially. Played by Javier Bardem who I thought did a fine job with the insanity acting. Notice how the cinematography and sound introduced him in his first scene.<br /><br />The tale had some lulls in the plotting and arguably some minor plotholes.<br /><br />Also starring Albert Finney and Naomie Harris.<br /><br />Old School Bond fans will dislike that there are a lack of awesome gadgets and that Bond isn't \\"getting it on\\" with several hot women but then the latter has been prevalent in the franchise refresh at the beginning so I'm not sure why the complaints are coming out now in mass. That said, this particular movie humanizes Bond the most and may break the fantasy image.<br /><br />This is the 50th anniversary of James Bond, by the way. Look for the nod to the Aston Martin of \\"Goldfinger\\". The Golden Globes have nominated this picture for it's \\"Best Original Song\\".<br /><br />The budget for this picture was roughly $150-200M and so far it has made over $951M at the Box Office.

(He is also shot in Thunderball during the junkanoo chase.)<br /><br />This movie is not direct story continuation of the previous two films the way Quantum of Solace followed Casino Royale. Producer Barbara Broccoli said that the series \\"will go on to other different stories from now on.\\" However, the reappearance of the QUANTUM organization in later films is still a possibility. Broccoli has said: \\"I think in some way, he will go after the [Quantum] organization. So in that sense, it may become a trilogy, but we haven't really structured it that way.\\"

B0031RAOVY|5.0|Beautiful but heart-wrenching story. It would have been less sad had passengers and other people helped make Haichi's wait at the train station more comfortable by giving him food, water, and building him a dog house to shield him from the harsh weather. The movie made it appear as though no one cared about the faithful dog who waited at the train station for his master every day for 10 years. I suppose if the message is to love your pets more and be kind to all animals, then, I am sure this movie will achieve its goal of better treatment of pets and other animals.

B0061S073A|5.0|Simple to use and set up.  Does exactly what I wanted it to do in providing my kids a safer tablet experience.  The one complaint I had read before getting this app was that it could be by passed by simply turning the tablet on and off.  If you set up a pin or password on your tablet, that issue is taken care of.  I would recommend this app for anyone who wants to control what their kids have access to.

0345803485|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about when I bought it. I had heard people talking about it with such comments as &#34;&#34;you have to read this&#34;&#34; and &#34;&#34;what a great book it was&#34;&#34; but no-one ever said what it was specifically about. Being a lover of all types of reading material I decided to get it. I actually thought it was going to be  some kind of self help book. I was definitely surprised to find out what it was about but it was a great and interesting read that I immediately bought the second and third books. Definitely worth your time!!

B007SGLZP8|2.0|Don't ususally review books, but I feel so strongly about this book that I am sending along my thoughts.  As the author states in the epilog, there was no research and not much else given to the writing of this book, and it shows.  All my friends who have read it, based on the author's name, were also disapointed with the book.  It reads like the author had a deadline, and this is what we got.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Amazing!<br /><br />I have been waiting for this book since I read 'The governess affair' and it was well worth the wait!  I normally love me a good alpha male - but oh!  they suddenly all became cardboard cut out men, and Robert Blaisdel the only true man around. Sigh! What a man!<br /><br />I have only ever read Milans novellas: 'Unlocked', 'What happened at midnight' and 'The governess affair' and I have no idea why???  Why have I not purchased everything the woman has ever jotted down on anything, including shopping lists and phone doodles?  She is an amazing writer and story teller.  I would be hard pressed to choose between her and Sherry Thomas, should I be asked to name my favourite author...  But I think 'The Duchess War' just put Milan a breath ahead in the stakes for me.<br /><br />Mostly because I love love love her heroes.  They are amazing men, and I want to marry everyone of them myself!<br /><br />But now I have to go purchase everything written by Milan, and also badger the woman via email about when the rest of this series will be available.

B008476HBM|5.0|Such a great read.  The book and movie are both amazing.  I would recommend for anyone to read this book.  Jane Austen was an amazing writer.
B00966TN1Q|5.0|As a long time fan of Michael Connolly, whom I consider the most relevant contemporary Police Thriller's writer, I cannot be very ojective in my analysis. I've read all his Harry Bosch's series and most of the rest of Connolly works and it would be hard for me to decide which one I've enjoyed the most. The Black Box exceeded my expectation, it is, as it is always advised about books, a real page turner, only this time is absolutely true. There is a sad side though, it becomes clear that Harry career at the LAPD is plunging fast to an end, although I prescient that it will happend with a great slam after solving a case that kicks many political asses and precipitates the fall of some big shots. When that occures, what will be next on Harry's life: staying home listening to jazz, full dedication to rise his teen daughter, police consultant, private eye, or what? Cannot wait to read the next Harry Bosch's story. For The Black Box I give it 5 stars.

B009LREA1S|4.0|I haven't followed the Christian Bale dark knight movies having seen portions of the previous films but I bought this in HD digital copy streamed to my blu ray and think it is one of the best action films I have seen in a while. Awesome music sets the tone for this dark yet inspiring last film in the dark knight series. After watching it, I happened to stream the original bat man film from well before my time (with the bat helicopter and penguin/joker/riddler on a submarine) to show my kids...boy am I glad they have moved away from the cheesiness of that and later films (arnold as freeze, john carey as the riddler) because the new dark, action packed versions leave you really appreciating both christian bale as an actor and batman as a real bad-a$$ facing quasi  realistic adversaries using futuristic, yet believable technologies (the bat helicopter \\"thing\\" is awesome and the militarized versions of the new batmobile and motorcycle reinforce a otherwise awesome movie)... I would give it five stars but think that should be reserved for my favorite movies of all time and it's not quite on that level but definitely worth buying.

B007EECSFA|4.0|I had a tough time getting through the first few chapters of this book.  But once I did, I became thoroughly entranced and absorbed by the characters, the scenery, and plot - which like all of Kate Morton's plots (I've read all of her books), is incredibly complex and twisty.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|Very happy that this comes in a combo pack.  This is my pick for best film of 2012.  If you're a Wes Anderson fan, you will notice his fingerprints all over this.  If you're unfamiliar with his work, then this is a great place to start.  He is, without question, an elite auteur.

B009NPKTN6|2.0|I know this was supposed to be campy but it really was hard to get through.  Julianne Hough has a great voice and I like her.  The acting was good but the script and all the rest blew what this could have been.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish there was a space for NO STARS! I can't see how any mature adult would like this trilogy! This was some of the most SILLY, IMMATURE FOOLISHNESS I'VE EVER READ!!  Anastasia had the mindset of a silly high school TWEEN who has never left her parents house! I don't know of ANY college aged women who are that naive! The biting of her lip, the constant whining & questioning Christian was more than I could take.  I purchased this trilogy expecting each book to be better than the last-NOT!  And PLEASE don't get me started on her uncontrollable orgasms! damn girl couldn't even handle sensual touching from him without BEGGING him to &#34;go inside.&#34;  The DUMB choices she made were ANNOYING plus was it just me, or did anyone else notice that although she was living with a BILLIONAIRE, she wore that dammed PLUM dress every other day?  Can't believe all the hype over this SILLYNESS! For those who haven't read these, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR & KEEP YOUR MONEY!

B0084U0IEG|5.0|This comic novel was a surprisingly quick read and a lot of fun. Set in England in the 1970s. Attractive (to men) female narrator from privileged background shows what life was like for women in the male-dominated Security Service. The female lead was just as plausible as the narrator of Kurt Anderson's recent novel. Subverts all the earnestness of the Smiley books. Very satisfying ending.

B008Y5OW20|5.0|Long Wave may be Jeff Lynne's best work because in this work he most reveals his many musical skills. Singing and playing all the instruments on this album Jeff Lynne makes melody,harmony and rhythm the most important thing on this album; and in doing so makes these eleven songs have a new life. Every song here seems to be the best version I have heard. Jeff Lynne covers a great variety of material here from standards to rhythm and blues chestnuts, and he plays,sings and produces them all with great musicality. I have listened to this many times over and smiled and laughed with delight as each song has revealed itself to be a different little gem.
