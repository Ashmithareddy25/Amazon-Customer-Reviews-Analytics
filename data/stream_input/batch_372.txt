0345363132|5.0|If you like to read about British history, this is a fabulous book.  The characters are well-defined, and although this is historical novel, it gives a completely different view of the characters than what you would read in other books - especially on Richard III.  This book is a page turner, and well worth reading!
B0000844IT|5.0|Army Of Darkness is the third part of the Evil Dead trilogy, of which I love since I was 4 years old. Just as Book Of The Dead Edition is the definitive one for the first film and the THX Mastered version is the definitive DVD for the second film, this Boomstick Edition is the definitive DVD version of Army of Darkness.<BR>Army Of Darkness Boomstick Edition is a 2-DVD Set. The first disc includes the U.S. Theatrical Version of Army Of Darkness (the one with the S-Mart/She-B**** ending) with both 5.1 and 2.0 sound, awesome video quality, and you can choose between Widescreen and Fullscreen to watch the Theatrical version of the movie. The first disc also includes the Theatrical Trailer and a featurette called \\"The Men Behind The Army\\", which is basically a docummentary about the movie's make-up effects; Talent Bios and the Original Ending of the movie, the one really meant to be, but separately from the original movie.<BR>The second DVD includes the Director's Cut version of Army Of Darkness, the one Sam Raimi first showed to Universal Pictures, and was refused because it was too long (it's 15 minutes longer then the Theatrical Version) and had a depressing ending (yes, this \\"depressive ending\\" is the original ending also presented in Disc 1, but this time it's presented together with the movie, not separately). This time you can only watch it Widescreen and 2.0 sound, there aren't any more audio or video options avaliable for the Director's Cut. The second disc has some extras too, like the hilarious audio commentary by Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Ivan Raimi; 4 deleted scenes, not presented in any of the movie's versions (there are also audio commentaries for the deleted scenes) and a very nice feature that, like a subtitle, as you watch the movie, storyboards of that scene you're watching just pop up in the lower part of your screen, so you can see what the director meant for that scene to be, and that's highly enjoyable.<BR>Overall, this edition is very worth your money. There are some things I didn't like, though: the fact that the DVD has a paper case, not a plastic case; there are no subtitles or Close Captions for either versions of the movie; and the lack of audio/video options in the Director's Cut version. But those are not very important and they won't let me rate this DVD less than five stars. You must also know that there is a booklet inside the case, which is basically the part where Bruce Campbell talks about Army of Darkness in his book \\"If Chins Could Kill\\" (which I highly recommend). No need to say the movie itself rocks, and no need to say you must buy this DVD. Come get some (fun), and hail to the king (Bruce Campbell)!
B000001G1E|5.0|This is probably the funkiest collection available. There's just no way you could be dissapointed by this boxset if you are at all interested in James Brown. It's awesome, relentless and irresistible: this music will bring out the funk in YOU and it feels just great. Also... this is invigorating music, somehow (this I think it has in common with classical music) it makes anything you play afterwards fresh and new (unless it's something really twee like the Carpenters) and for that alone it is easily recommended. If you have the cash, this is money well spent. There's a reason for all the 5 star reviews here. It's Star Time!

B00004X0Q0|5.0|When I first heard this album I really thought very little of it. The more I explored its progressiveness the more the music came together. At The Drive In ,in general, uses a very creative and progressive style that I personally love. There use of a synthesizer and piano in a progressive punk hardcore style fits perfectly. The vocals outstand very well and mix perfectly together a hardcore yelling and talking style with a high syncranized singing style filled with passion. The lyrics and music merge together beautifully, in a really genius fashion. The lyrics are quite poetic with use of analogies and other poetic devices. This album in my opinion is At The Drive In's best work. &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; accentuates all the aspects of the band that I love and personally think makes them unique. If you want a good preview of what to expect from this band this is the album to listen to. Although you can not expect anything else from this band, because they broke up a while ago, they divided into 2 other bands, Sparta and The Mars Volta. Neither of these bands come together quite as well as At The Drive In, but they are still good. Sparta has much of the anger and emotion from At The Drive In and The Mars Volta has much of the creativity. Once again when I first heard ATDI I was not to impressed but if you feel the same just listen to it a little more and a little closer and you will see it's pure genius.
0962477060|2.0|I've been playing guitar for 7 years now and I've bought this book some years ago, thinking it would make me master my guitar, based on other reviews I've seen. Well... it has not.<br />It teaches you a myriad of fingering patterns to play chords, scales, arpegios and scale runs, without needing to know the single notes on you fretboard. And that's also the problem: there are too much patterns! I remember that I worked my way to the 3/4th of the book, then... well I lost interest. Now I've almost forgotten them all...[...]<br />And in fact learning the notes on the fretboard and learning the notes in the most common scales (and chords) is less overhead and more usefull than learning all these patterns.<br />So, you understood it, today I very rarely refer to this book anymore
B000002LOM|4.0|Those who don't like this album are either the Moz fanatics who haven't heard anything outside of Moz, Cure or new-wave mop rock or just fail to discover the seeds of innovation.  Perhaps \\"Kill Uncle\\" was too experimental, stripped down, or uncharacteristic  for most of his fans, but that's what makes this album so intriguing and ground breaking in a subtle way...  Too many Moz and Smiths album so the same.  Having outgrown nearly all the songs of the Smiths and Moz, \\"Kill Uncle\\" still stands the test of time very much the same way The Smith's \\"Rubber Ring\\" - because they sound so original.  The unpolished and simple production gives Kill Uncle that unique sense of romantic intimacy suspended in a light cloud of existential levity which would eventually flow in a more polished \\"Vauxhall and I.\\"  This album may be more of interest to voracious record collectors or musicians rather than so-called \\"hardcore\\" Morrissey fans (you know who you are) who haven't evolved past \\"Your Arsenal\\" or \\"Bona Drag.\\"
B00009ZYC0|5.0|The famously talented and crazy Philip K. Dick was sort of an SF Kafka. He was a writer of great power and great paranoia, who used both to question the nature of humanity and of reality itself.<br />It's bloody hard to adapt his stories to the screen, but there have been at least two adaptations that have been wildly successful as movies in their own right: Ridley Scott's _Blade Runner_ and Paul Verhoeven's _Total Recall_. I also think well of Christian Duguay's _Screamers_, although it's not of the quality (or budget) of the other two.<br />I've liked Tom Cruise since about 1988 or so. Before that, he seemed to be stuck playing slick, self-absorbed prettyboy hustlers. As of the excellent _Rain Man_, though, he seemed to be stretching himself, and as of _A Few Good Men_ I was persuaded that the guy had serious acting chops. He's continued since that time with a string of good movies, most of which I've enjoyed. (I especially liked _Vanilla Sky_, a remake of the excellent _Abre los Ojos_. If you've seen one, be sure to see the other sometime.)<br />I've also liked several (though not all) of Steven Spielberg's films. He's a talented director.<br />But I would never, never, never have thought that either one of these guys, let alone _both_ of them, would be involved in a screen adaptation of a Phil Dick short story. Nor would I have predicted that the result of such involvement would be anywhere near as successful as this one is.<br />_Minority Report_ is one of the finest Dick adaptations I've seen. It's very nearly of the quality of _Blade Runner_.<br />(I don't mean that it's necessarily a good translation-to-the-screen of the original story itself. Dick's original stories are all but unfilmable, and to be done 'right' they'd require an approach more like David Cronenberg's in _Naked Lunch_. I mean that it's an excellent motion picture on its own terms that successfully carries over some of the most important 'Dickian' themes and elements.)<br />The cinematography alone is nothing short of mesmerizing. If you like, you can turn down the sound and just _watch the pretty pictures_ for two and a half hours. Every frame is an artfully constructed composition, some of them in colors that may never have existed before.<br />The script is excellent. As I'm sure you know, Cruise plays John Anderton, the head of Washington, D.C.'s experimental Precrime Unit, which uses three precognitives ('precogs') to arrest people for crimes they were _about_ to commit. The script doesn't duck the metaphysical problems with this approach but indeed faces them head-on; that's a large part of both the point and the plot.<br />The cast is also excellent (especially Samantha Morton and Max von Sydow). Even John Williams (of whom I am not normally a huge fan) does a nice job providing a suitable score.<br />I won't tell you anything more on the off-chance that you haven't seen it yet. I'll just say that the thing stays on target all the way through and that some parts of it will haunt your nightmares forever afterward.<br />Naturally the film owes a great deal to _Blade Runner_ for its overall mood, but it's also heavily indebted to Stanley Kubrick's screen adaptation of Anthony Burgess's _A Clockwork Orange_. (I assume there are other viewers out there who caught the significance of the fact that von Sydow's character is named 'Burgess'. If you have Kubrick's film on DVD, pause the newspaper-clipping portion and read the names.)<br />_Very_ nicely executed. I don't normally review films that already have umpty-hundred reviews, but for this one I'm making an exception.

B0000C9JFO|5.0|When Xavier (Romain Duris) became an exchange student in order to learn Spanish so he can get a plum job in economics, he didn't realize he was in for much more than just language lessons. In Spain, he meets a host of other young Europeans -- some of whom will embark with him on an odyssey of a lifetime. THE SPANISH APARTMENT is a marvellous film of friendship, love, and identity. During his own year stay at the University of Barcelona he learns valuable lessons that will surely impact him the remainder of his youth. His eyes witness the extreme diversity of what it means to be Spanish, European, and a human being.<br />The cinematography is remarkable. Set primarily in Barcelona, I was pleasantly reminded of my own travels in this colorful and vibrant city. In addition, several film tricks were utilized (i.e., fast-farwarding and simultaneous dual images of the same scene) resulting in a unique visual experience. I also appreciated the identity issues raised throughout this film, and how people were confronted with the ignorance of others and themselves.<br />Watching THE SPANISH APARTMENT was 120 minutes of pleasure, enjoyment, and amusement. Enjoy!
B000059XUO|5.0|In the history of screen adaptations of comic books, Alex Proyas's adaptation of James O'Barr's underground comic _The Crow_ is one of the finest. I like Marvel Comics a lot and I've enjoyed most of the recent adaptations of the Marvel catalogue. But in comics-to-screen-land, I have _three_ favorite Lees: Stan, Ang, and the late Brandon.<br />(Brandon Lee, as most visitors to this page will already know, died tragically as this film was being produced. That's a terrible loss and it adds an even darker edge to an already dark film.)<br />Alex Proyas, who would later give us the haunting noir-SF _Dark City_, here turns his directorial hand to bringing _The Crow_ to (heh heh) life. The film recalls all the best elements of Tim Burton's first _Batman_ film and, I think, outdoes its predecessor by quite a bit.<br />You probably already know the plot here. Rock musician Eric Draven (d'Raven; get it?) and his fiancee Shelly Webster are brutally murdered on Devil's Night (the night before Halloween). Exactly one year later, Draven returns temporarily to life in order to exact revenge on the thugs who murdered them. Which he does, very stylishly.<br />Dressed in Goth black and with his face painted white, he comes across as something like a vampire, something like a one-man combination of Batman and the Joker, and something like the old comic book hero the Spectre (remember? murdered policeman Jim Corrigan returned from the dead?). The whole thing is calculated, in the old Batman phrase, to strike terror into the hearts of evildoers, and so is Draven's remarkable healing ability: since his wounds close over just about as fast as they're formed, he's all but unstoppable.<br />Anyway, the overarching theme is that love is eternal, but along the way we get to see a lot of dark and gratifying violence as the bad guys get what's coming to them.<br />The cast and the script are magnificent. Of course the late Brandon Lee steals the show. But everybody else is good too, including the bird.<br />The cinematography is brilliant. Everything is muted into almost pure black and white, with occasional touches of red. The cityscape is wonderfully realized, fitting somewhere between Burton's Gotham and Proyas's own Dark City. And it always seems to be raining. On top of all that, the entire thing is lifted high into the (night) sky by Graeme Revell's otherworldly score.<br />If you like noir fantasy, don't miss this one. The genre doesn't get any better.he bird.<br />The cinematography is brilliant. Everything is muted into almost pure black and white, with occasional touches of red.

B000089RVX|5.0|It's refreshing to hear a different sound, music is a lot more diverse nowadays and we can thank this cd for that. I love this cd. It's awesome. I would label this sound alternative rock. Its a perfect pick for those that are looking for something different. My favorite songs are: Going Under, Bring Me To Life, My Immortal, and Tourniquet.
B000056NX5|1.0|This DVD is terrible and not worth watching. The characters lack passion and are unbelievable.   I had to force myself to sit through it until I could not take it anymore.  Don't waste your time with this one, watch the original again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wasn't able to watch this show when it aired... but I bought the DVD set and I completely hooked. My wife and mother love it and we've stayed up late these past few nights to watch another episode.<BR>The only shame here is that Fox dropped the ball... Even though I've always been a trekkie, I'd much rather watch this. Heck, I'd even say that this is the ebst sci-fi series I've ever seen, and that is saying a lot.<br />Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00001QEE5|4.0|You people who complain about jealousy and malice! Most characters in the original novel -were- jealous and mean, but they had redeeming qualities. As a movie, this does disappoint me, but only the pictures. None of the characters looked as I imagined them except John and Michael. The costumes were off. Disney always does that. Pleaaase read the book, people! It's so wonderful. AND SEE THE LIVE REMAKE THAT JUST CAME OUT, IT'S AWESOME!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The color alone is worth the price of this DVD! It looks like it did in the theatres when it came out. Close-ups of Olivia de Havilland are particularly stunning. A word of caution, though: To enjoy the color, you will have to make sure your TV's color, tint, and contrast are set correctly (NOT like in the stores) so that flesh tones look natural, not like oranges wearing black wigs (as they do in the stores).

B00009V7RF|5.0|I have always been a fan of Black Eyed Peas, and their newest album &quot;Elephunk&quot; is phenomenal in every way possible. People are saying that fans of their old CDs will be disappointed with this new one, and that is completely not true whatsoever in my opinion. Musicians are SUPPOSED to grow and evolve over time, and just because this new album doesn't sound like some of their older stuff, it in no way means that fans will be disappointed. CHANGE is GOOD sometimes. And the addition of the female singer(Fergie) to the group is pure genius because that girl can sing! I thought it might be a bad idea at first, but after hearing the album and how much quality she adds to it, i was blown away. You want proof? Just listen to track #9 &quot;Fly Away&quot;, she sings most of that song and proves that she could be a great artist all on her own. Who else has noticed that she sounds a lot like Alicia Keys in the opening words of &quot;Let's Get Retarded&quot;? Speaking of that track, it's one of the best on the CD. 2 minutes and 22 seconds into the song, it blows up and it's impossible not to bounce your head and dance! The whole album is truly incredible and there's really not one BAD song on it. I highly recommend it to any fan of great, original music!
0452283760|3.0|While I was reading this book every paragraph seemed to give me a different feeling. Most parts were laughable on how blunt the woman could be to get her point across. Others stuck a nerve to a deep realization that what she says has truth. While reading this novel you can definitely tell she wasn't writing for the casual reader. Speeches drag on, characters disappoint you, but for some reason people have latched on to her like she is the goddess of objectivism and can't be question with. I did enjoy the novel to the point where I respect the thoughts it contains and what the novel has done for many peoples lives. For my own satisfaction I would not read the novel again. It did teach me many lessons but after reading the Fountainhead there seems to be no hope for mankind and leaves a deep depressing thought in ones mind after reading. Many people would just say I don't understand and comprehend, but you can't believe everything one woman says just because she was one of the first that questioned society this way.
B00008PW2D|1.0|Only 8 episodes for $32.49 - WHAT A RIP-OFF.  Mind you the episodes were OK, but not as good as the first four seasons.  However, the price per episode is very high.  I'd think twice before buying a wait for the sixth season.
B00005ASHM|5.0|While being interviewed about this album, Paul M. (of the Beatles) answered a question concerning the lyrics saying (basically) that LYRICS AREN'T IMPORTANT. This album has stupid lyrics. The music is amazing. THE LYRICS SUCK. Stop defending this album by analyzing the freaking words. Brian Wilson wasn't a poet. He was a composer.<br />The music is moving, not the words. An the music is fantastic. The haunting harmonies on some of the slower ballads give me chills every time.

B000002VC5|4.0|The Alan Parsons Project really came at the wrong time. When the music industry was desperate to sign up punk bands who could barely play a few chords, here was a collective of skilled musicians, sublimating their own identities in support of a producer with prog-rock leanings. And by the time CD technology arrived, the Alan Parsons Project had already cut most of their best work, and the problem was that, when it came to replacing our favourite LPs with the CD version, APP albums weren't typically top of our list.<br />So I will be the first to admit that I've neglected APP over the years. It is over 20 years since I heard this album and, having just bought it on CD, it is sheer joy to hear so many high-quality tracks that I'd had nagging in the back of my mind over the years and I'd been unable to place. I'd previously bought an APP compilation on CD, but classics such as 'Some Other Time' and 'The Voice' seem to have been excluded from all his 'Best of' collections.<br />This CD is AAD and not remastered, but it sounds pretty good, all the same. (Parsons gave its predecessor, 'Tales of Mystery', a thorough re-working for CD, not only remastering it but also getting Ian Bairnson to lay down new guitar tracks.)<br />When 'Tales of Mystery' came out in 1976, there was a certain amount of hype about it, much of it related to Parsons' work on DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. The album even got favourably reviewed by Derek Jewell on Radio 3's 'Sounds Interesting'. But some buyers, myself included, were disappointed at the time, because of the 'difficult' side two, which was largely classical. It therefore came as a great relief that the follow-up 'I Robot' wasted none of its tracks on classical pretensions.<br />I first heard the single 'I wouldn't want to be like you' when visiting the US for the first time. I was spending up to eight hours a day on a Trekamerica minibus, going from NY to LA, fed an unbroken diet of pop radio, which at the time seemed to revolve around endless repetitions of 'Easy' by the Commodores, 'Nobody does it better' by Carly Simon, and the disco version of the 'Star Wars' theme. Suddenly, towards the end of the holiday, stations started playing 'I wouldn't want to be like you', and it was both a relief and a joy to discover that APP had cut a second album and made a decent single. I just had to buy the LP as soon as I returned to Britain.<br />This album is rather more consistent than its predecessor. Gone as vocalists are Arthur Brown and John Miles, but in their place are a strong team headed by Lenny Zakatek and a remarkably ego-free Steve Harley.<br />In summary, the only thing preventing this from being a 5-star rating is that it's not remastered. Strongly recommended nevertheless -- you'll be surprised how many tunes you remember! This team will only have achieved the long-term recognition they deserve as composers when a student on 'Pop Idol' chooses to sing 'Some Other Time'!repetitions of 'Easy' by the Commodores, 'Nobody does it better' by Carly Simon, and the disco version of the 'Star Wars' theme.

0780626966|5.0|The Nightmare on Elm Street Collection is possibly one of the best &quot;value for money&quot; items you can buy.  The box comes equipped with 8 DVDs and a booklet.  The DVDs include all the Nightmare on Elm Street installments plus New Nightmare and an Encylopaedia.<br />All DVDs have been digitally remastered and appear in wide screen format.  The quality is crisp and clear.  This may come as a relief for those who have tried renting out the old, jaded analog copies from the local rental store with a soundtrack hardly audible and an image hardly legible.  At least you can watch your favourite horror flick in digital over and over without ever having to worry about the quality degrading.<br />One minor disadvantage - which can be overlooked thanks to the cheap price - is a slight &quot;dodgy&quot; look.  It is barely noticeable but in parts the film &quot;buffers&quot; and the first nightmare appears somewhat jerky.  It would appear that New Line Cinema may have digitalised this from an AVI format since it is a cheaper (and less labour intensive) alternative - maybe that's why it's such a bargain!  But it is almost unnoticeable and the trade-off is well worth it.<br />Of course, the encyclopaedia - and booklet - add value to this for collectors giving the films a history that would otherwise be overlooked.  Even though the interviews in the encylopaedia have no subtitles, each of the films has been digitalised with optional subtitles.  Furthermore, each DVD has its own unique, on-screen menu and its own separate case - with given chapter headings - all within the larger box seen in the picture for this product.<br />For those die-hard fans of Freddy, this collection is not to be overlooked.  It is a much cheaper alternative to buying the individual DVDs.  With this much value, you must be dreaming!

B00004XQ83|5.0|This album represents something that has been long overdue in the mainstream music industry for the past 2 or 3 decades.  Most music being released has slowly but surely digressed to the Brittney Spears and Madonna image.  Even some favorite country artists are finding that they have to dress in skimpy clothes to sell records.  Quite honestly, its time to make some music available to the major market that is not centered around the themes of drugs, sex, and how many STD's a person can acquire in one night.  I'm not saying that Notorious B.I.G. has very bad songs, I have listened to those too, and the rhythms are good.  However, if all that is available in the mainstream is songs of distruction and corruption, what can we possibly expect our society to become.  I'm not saying that rock, metal, rap, and pop artists should be banished.  They have a right to play their music just as everyone else does.  ITS ABOUT VARIETY.  Let's have some more records like this (even if they are reproductions from the past) where at least people have a choice when they go the record store.  No, I don't mean the tiny rack in the back corner where the store wants $22.99 for a 40 year old song. Stores should display such records beside Metallica, 3 Doors Down etc.  Let the people make the choice, not the industry. Then the industry will find less piracy, and a more enthusiastic audience.
B0000AM6JI|1.0|I don't know what is wrong with you people.  This is the worst Brian DePalma film, Al Pacino's worst film, and quite frankly the worst movie I have ever seen.  When they played &quot;You are so Beautiful,&quot; there was literally cheese dripping off the reel.  The plot is contrived, there is no character development and the acting, not to mention the writing and directing is awful.  DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE&gt;
0452282152|1.0|I really did not enjoy this book.  While it started off okay, I really found it dragging.  After a while I wasn't even excited to read it anymore.  I really disliked the main character which may be one reason.  It moved too slowly and there wasn't enough action.  Don't waste your money.
B00009M6VJ|4.0|&quot;The Life of David Gale,&quot; just falls short.  I actually thought the script was the strong point of the movie almost holding up to other thrillers of the same ilk, &quot;Memento,&quot; and &quot;Dead Man Walking,&quot; come to mind.  However where the weakness lies is in the acting.<br />Interesting that a director seems to have such great influence across the board on the acting of any given cast members.  Take other movies that have great actors turning in semi-terrible performances, Star Wars prequels and Samuel L. Jackson and Liam Neeson and you will understand the point.  Laura Linney, Kate Winslet, and Kevin Spacey are all terrifically nuanced and artful actors but here the performances just aren't believable.  You can tell the actors are trying to act, instead of just presenting believable performances that puts the viewer gazing into the window of their world.  Spacey is the only one that really rises above the mediocre din of performances that director Alan Parker conjures.<br />In my mind I am comparing this movie, oddly enough, to Michael Moore's &quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot; and find &quot;The Life of David Gale,&quot; the better of the two.  I believe both scripts were written with liberal political messages in mind.  David Gale being anti-capital punishment, Columbine anti-gun violence.  David Gale gets it more right.<br />The story involves a group of anti-execution activists and the journalist (Kate Winslet) that has access to death row inmate Gale (Kevin Spacey) for a last week interview session to get the story right.  And get the story right she does, though the movies twists and turns leaves you guessing up to the end.  I felt the movie tried to explain too much and would have benefited from a simpler approach, but was intrigued to find out just where it was headed.<br />There are some graphic scenes that are hard to watch, but in the end it leaves you thinking about the death penalty and the Texas approach to justice and leaves you with questions...What if?ou with questions...What if?

B000026C3T|5.0|Led Zeppelin are my favourite band, at the moment. Remasters has all my favourite Zeppelin songs. I made a good choice on buying this ro be my first Led Zeppelin CD. Because If I bought 1, I probably would'nt have got 2.I love all these songs. If your a beginning Led Zeppelin fan, get this for your first.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney Spears' new CD is much different from all her others, and also much worse.  I used to be a big fan, but I don't believe her voice is much.  She needs to become a professional dancer and give up on the singing, because it isn't working for her.  She seems like a nice person, but it doesnt mean she can sing.
B000060P79|1.0|My 13-year-old sister, who, for some inexplicable reason, loves this band, got this album for Christmas and has yet to take it out of her CD player, which means that I have been subjected to this torture for almost two weeks. Having been privy to this, I feel that I am more than qualified to say that this is, without a doubt, one of the worst albums ever produced and that I am very surprised that people actually buy this utterly devoid garbage.  Where to begin?<br />This band, like Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, and the leader of this brigade, Blink-182, is one of those generic, corporate, manufactured bubble-gum pop-punk bands that completely lack originality and are only polluting our airwaves for the sole purpose of ingraining this disposable junk into the heads of their intended pre-teen and teenage demographic and to, thus, rob them of their minimum-wage after-school job money.  What I find even more despicable is that this strategy is actually working and that this music, along with the equally deplorable hip-hop genre, is dominating our popular culture overall.  Many of the people who listen to this kind of music have no idea that there is a multitude of better music out there and that it is not that hard to find.<br />Now, on to the music.  My very first complaint I have with this band is with their singer.  HE SOUNDS LIKE A WHINY 14-YEAR-OLD B**** WHO CAN'T STOP CRYING BECAUSE HE JUST GROUNDED FOR THE WEEKEND!  I could sing better (and I royally suck)!  Heck, my dad, who has a respectable taste in music and has also been subjected to this, calls this band \\"The Whiners\\" and shares my resentment for them.  The singer's voice is simply just not tolerable.  He has no talent or vocal range, he sounds like he is pre-pubescent and has a permanent case of nasal congestion, and his lyrics could very easily have been better written by an illiterate six-year-old.  The lyrics are simple (no pun intended), hokey, and completely lack depth.  They sound like they were written from the viewpoint of a white upper-middle-class middle school boy who has everything but is crying out because he thinks, for some reason, that everyone owes him something.  However, considering that that is the demographic that listens to this music, listeners, sadly, think they can relate and this might be why they like it.<br />However, I cannot discriminate in giving out the blame solely to the completely untalented singer.  The band is just as responsible for the ever-so-poor quality of music.  There are a lot of musicians in the band (five or six I think) and completely dispel the theory that more is better.  The guitarists seem to know one chord, two at the absolute most (and for that reason, don't play solos, not like any of the bands in this genre do, another symbol of their lack of musicianship).  The bass is virtually inaudible and the drummer tries way too much stuff that simply does not work.<br />However, the band cannot solely be blamed for this music.  Whoever wrote this music should be shot.  These songs obviously follow a formula and, in many parts of many of these songs, are the same measure repeated over and over, followed by a harder (or slower) refrain, another verse, refrain, painfully awful and musically lacking bridge, no instrument solo, a shrill vocal solo, and 600 refrains on out.  Many other genres and bands follow a similar formula but seem to do it well.  The problem is that not only is the musical performance dreadful, but the songwriting is worse.  It is completely unoriginal and outright annoying.  But I guess that is the goal of these songwriters.  To write songs that, with these overly-manipulated guitars, five-string basses, and studio overproduction, are annoying enough to stick in your head after the millionth time you hear it on the radio or \\"that so-called music channel,\\" thus literally forcing you to buy the album.<br />I'm tired of slandering this bottom-feeding noise that attempts to call itself music.  I'm unhappyI even had to give it one star.  I'm gonna go listen to some Led Zeppelin, Pearl Jam, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Disturbed, Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, Staind, Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band, Collective Soul, Tantric, Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stone Temple Pilots, Puddle of Mudd, Led Zeppelin, Soundgarden, Theory of a Deadman, Audioslave, Buckcherry, Alice in Chains, etc. a.k.a. some REAL music.  AC/DC once said that \\"Rock and roll ain't noise pollution,\\" but if Simple Plan actually considers itself rock and gutter-noise such as this is it's future, then it's well on it's way.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I LOVE JOSH GROBAN! HE HAS THE MOST AMAZING VOICE AND THIS CD IS JUST AS GREAT AS THE FIRST ONE. HE WILL BE AROUND FOREVER. HE IS A CLASSIC AT 22!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|All of the songs on this CD are captivating and intruiging. They paint a picture of the book that so finalizes the movie. Even if you haven't seen the movie yet, I guarantee that you will be moved by this soundtrack. There are new parts which are so well blended with previous themes from the other two Lord of the Rings movies. Also, Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen bring in variety of voices. This sound track described in one word: WOW. And hey, who know a hobbit could sing so well?
0375432302|2.0|This book is poorly written and researched. Dan Brown has a interesting subject, but he completely fabricates history and distorts facts.  But Dan Brown does a great job in crafting a book to dupe conspiracy nuts.<br />For anyone who studies history, this is a difficult book to get through.  I encourage people to take a deeper look into any of the &quot;historical accounts&quot; in this book.....its embarassing.<br />There are too many facts to dispute, but here are just a few...<br />-Most Knights of Templar were crushed by King Philip the Fair of France....not the Catholic church.<br />-Brown's characters state that the Church burned five million women as witches, which show Dan Brown's malicious ignorance of historical record. The latest figures for deaths during the European witch craze are between 30,000 to 50,000 victims. Not all were executed by the Church, not all were women, and not all were burned.<br />-He claims that the motions of the planet Venus trace a pentacle (the so-called Ishtar pentagram) symbolizing the goddess. But it isn't a perfect figure and has nothing to do with the length of the Olympiad. The ancient Olympic games were celebrated in honor of Zeus Olympias, not Aphrodite, and occurred every four years.<br />-Brown's analysis of da Vinci's work is just as ridiculous. He presents the Mona Lisa as an androgynous self-portrait when it's widely known to portray a real woman, Madonna Lisa, wife of Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo. The name is certainly not - as Brown claims - a mocking anagram of two Egyptian fertility deities Amon and L'Isa (Italian for Isis).
B00005JM1F|5.0|You just have to see this movie. Will Ferrel, right that, that's a reason. <BR>When you watch this movie you will laugh, you will think it's silly and you will find yourself letting go to just have fun. Old School is  a great comedy about some guys who like to have fun, to want to live a bit in the past and don't see the need to play by the rules. Check it out.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is the Beatles masterpiece.  Okay, it's one of several masterpieces by the Beatles.  This particular album is their last masterpiece.  I don't need to say much about it, because it has been written about extensively already.  But I will say that it more than lives up to the hype surrounding it, and you should buy it unless you are one of the few people who hate the Beatles.
0452285186|5.0|I absolutely cannot STAND it when people in the bookstore make NOISES about the books they're looking at.  No snorting, whispering, nothing.  Most of all -- NO LAUGHING!  I happened to notice this book on a table at the bookstore tonight.  Picked it up.  LOVED the description under the title -- &quot;Fluffy little bunnies that just don't want to live anymore.&quot;  I should've stopped there.  Because when I started flipping through and checking out the pics ... I couldn't help it.  I laughed.  Out loud.  A lot.  Then I went and got my husband to glance through it with me.  Together we laughed.  Out loud.  A lot.  Before we left the store, I saw two other people pick up the same book and do the same thing and it didn't even make me mad ... Have I become one of THEM?!?!<br />The book is cool.  A must-have.  It may be warped and weird, but reading this book will make you happy.  Beats a trip to the shrink anyday!
B000001FKZ|4.0|This album is hard rockin fun. When you start to listen to it you can tell the quality they put into it. It starts off with the pulse pounding Women and the first side ends with Armegeddon It. The song layouts on the first side are perfect. Guitar solos, singing, drumming, and all are timed to perfection. The second side opens with Gods of War and the quality drops dramatically. Hysteria is the standout track of the second side. While the second side is not bad, it can't compare to the first. The mixing isn't as good, or any part of the songs for that matter. Still worth a listen, though.<br />Def Leppard spent 3 years recording this album, so they must have got tired of recording and just tried to get it out. You can't blame them, I wouldn't have wanted to spend another minute in the studio either, but the final album isn't as good as it could have been. With oodles more time this album could have been the best album ever, but 3 years is too much time as it is.<br />7 excellent songs and 5 good songs more than make this a great album. Give them credit for what they did and ignore the few mistakes.
0380799006|5.0|I love this book... My kids are now 5 & 3 and there is another on the way. I have read this book cover to cover & keep it handy for quick references when I feel I need a \\"refresher\\".<br />What I like about this book is it is easy to read, easy to follow, easy to understand. My copy is dog earred, highlighted and has pencil marks in the margins. <br />The advice is easy to follow and does not need lots of 'analysis' to get started. It covers basic topics, but once you 'get the gest of what to do' it's easy to apply the theories to just about every situation you may encounter as a parent.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Its an amazingly good show.  Theres nothing I can say about it that hasnt been said in the previous 300+ reviews.  What I can do is comment on Fox's stupidity.<br />Take a series from an accomplished story teller like Joss Whedon (Yes, he did Buffy, but dont forget he was a writer for PIXARs Toy Story as well), air the series out of sequence, bounce its air time around 3 times (hard to do with only 11 aired episodes) and dont air all the episodes.  Then scrub it.  Never mind the fact it got great reviews.  Never mind the fact that it had all the hallmarks of FOX's only other hit series...<br />One of the first things I thought of when I watched this was X-Files.  Its a little show that FOX aired that got little attention its first season, but because of stellar writing and interesting stories it grew into a mega hit through word of mouth.  Firefly has the same (or better) high quality writing and far better characters.<br />It obvious that the folks at FOX just didnt get it.  I think some executive had his mind made up before the first episode hit the air.  <br />Well guess what FOX? I will never again watch another of your series its first season no matter how good it sounds.  Im tired of getting hooked on series that they will randomly yank (Dark Angel?  Space, Above and Beyond?) and replace with some other schlock I have no intrest in.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I got this cd a while back, and me being a huge Pink Floyd fan, I thought this was one fantastic album.  They captured both the highs and lows, one of my favorite rocking tracks of the album being &quot;Electioneering&quot;, and songs like &quot;Subterrean Homesick Alien&quot; to balance out the lows.<br />All in all, this is a must buy for anyone looking for GOOD music!
B00005JMCW|5.0|I think that Freaky Friday is a movie for almost everyone. It is so funny and you know exactly what the mother and daughter mean in their reactions when they change bodies for example: Belly Ring? Yes I think every mother would freak out to find their daughter had one at the age of 15(?)! Most teens find their mothers clothes rather dull compared to their own and seeing as all of this is made into a movie along with many other funny moments makes it a movie worth buying!
B00013F35I|5.0|I have been a Bruce Springsteen fan my entire life and when I learned of the completion of his first concert DVD I was estatic.  I couldn't wait to pop it in and watch his concert in Barcelona.  I was fortunate to have the opportunity to see him at the meadowlands in August while he was winding down his tour.  When I first put on this DVD I cranked up my BOSE speakers and started hopping up and down to the RISING!  I mean ladies and gentleman, the sound quality gives every viewer a concert like feel.  The adrenaline starts pumping when you see the intense reaction of the foreign crowd.  It is absolutely mind-blowing.  Rather than complaining about the sound quality of the DVD go out and purchase yourself a pair of good speakers, and you will understand how incredible of an experience it actually is to watch Bruce Springsteen perform!
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is one of the most raw and powerful albums since the days of Nirvana. A powerful step forward by the White Stripes.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I bought this on a whim after reading some reviews.  I'd never listened to much of Shania Twain, but I must say I am a convert.  I just finished listening to the DVD for the second time in 24 hours and am on my way to pick up additional titles.  It's easy to see why she's so popular.  So-so audio, but the quality of the video and music easily earns this DVD 5 stars.  Like others, I also wish there were a Shania commentary.<br />For anyone who likes Shania Twain, this is a must-have.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is genre entertainment...  No, make that television...  No, make that the art of narrative in any visual medium at its very finest.  Firefly is comprised of the smartest of writing, the sharpest of acting and the kind of deft directing that Hollywood strives for (but rarely achieves).  To see this show in its complete 14 episode, widescreen glory is to forget that you are watching something originally produced for television and not one of the slickest, most intelligent big screen efforts in years.
B000060P79|5.0|Every song on this album is great... I just want to jump up and down and sing along!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Lord of the Rings trilogy is an excellent movie series. If you have read the books you can appreciate this movies battle scenes as they show a more in depth experience you cannot attain through the books. not to mention the amazing cinematography! the greatest film angles ever. You can realy feel the emotions of the actors, they show a great view of the characters. BUY TODAY i reccoment greatly
B000002L9Y|5.0|Excellent album by an amazing band! &quot;Little Lies&quot; is my all-time favorite Fleetwood Mac song. Stevie fans may not be too thrilled with this album since she was goign through rehab during the time of its production, but she still gets a good one in with &quot;Seven Wonders.&quot;
B00009V7RF|5.0|Blingin abulm,Thats da only way 2 describe it ,go buy its fricken amazin,
B00005JMFI|5.0|Although this movie didn't have the historic truth of Christmas, it had the heart of Christmas, giving, sharing, caring and love.This movie had me, my kids and grandkids laughing all the way through it.My face hurt from laughing so hard.There was a couple of serious parts but that only brought the attention of family and how blessed we are that have families to mind.Will Farrell was the best person to play this part and made his role as an elf believable. Enjoyed it to the max!
0553573403|5.0|Great book, whoever complains about it not having enough \\"fantasy\\", shouldnt be writing a review. The fact that this book lacks hobbits, elves, and magical purple faeries, yet keeps a sense of fantasy(The Others..dragons etc.) makes it even better.<br />It's hard to start the book, but once you get used to the author's unique style of writing, it consumes you. It's just awesome, go read it right now.. RIGHT NOW OMFG.
B00000DHRX|5.0|\\"Ladies & Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael\\" is George Michael's greatest hits from his solo career.  During and after his days of Wham!, he recorded some of the catchiest dance tracks and the most slow danceable ballads.  Most are still commonly played in dances and on the radio today.  His unique style remains to be touched.  His combination of love, sexuality, and controversy keeps every lyric interesting.  The musical combination of funk, dance, pop, and soul remains undeniably unforgettable.  As he's evolved as an artist, his work becomes more and more fearless.  This double-disc album presents how he's evolved as an artist up to 1998, the release year.  They're taken mostly from his albums \\"Faith\\"(1987), \\"Listen Without Prejudice #1\\"(1990), \\"Older\\"(1996), and individual solo projects he recorded during his time with Wham!.  Every track answers why he's scored ten number one singles on the Billboard Top 100 Singles Charts and why he's won two Grammys, including Album of the Year(\\"Faith\\").<br />Disc number one, \\"for the heart\\", presents his ballads.  He sings every track with intense heart and soul.  His beautiful voice grabs the listeners attention easily and keeps them listening closely.  His duets with Elton John and Astrud Gilberto are beautiful.  His remakes of classic songs \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me\\"(Elton John) and \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\"(Bonnie Raitt) live up to the original.  With this compilation, he includes a newly recorded track \\"A Different Corner\\", which lives up to his past hit singles.<br />His second disc, \\"for the feet\\", presents his upbeat songs.  Every track includes their own way to attract listeners to the dance floor.  Most, not all, of his most controversal singles are his dance tracks.  His sexuality is most expressed here, which offers an added edge to him and gives listeners the added sensuality, especially behind bedroom doors.  Despite such theme, they always carry a powerful message(monogamy, AIDS, etc.).  His duets with Aretha Franklin and Queen add an extra upbeat flavor to the individual track.  His remakes of classic singles \\"Killer/Papa Was a Rolling Stone\\"(Seal/The Temptations) and \\"Somebody To Love\\"(Queen) live up to the original.  His new track, \\"Outside\\", explores his most daring move in his career, coming out as a homosexual.  <br />\\"Ladies & Gentlemem: The Best of George Michael\\" is highly important material for every George Michael fan to own.  This trip down memory lane will surely please many listeners.  Such musical evolution proves that the end is nowhere near; rather, the best is yet to come.<br />***Note: There are no tracks in this album by Wham!.  Those are on a separate CD: \\"The Best of Wham!\\".
0385504209|1.0|Mr. Brown is on a quest to defame the Catholic church.  It seems to be his holy grail, so to speak.  I suppose fact and thoughtful consideration would be too much of a stretch so he has resorted to attacks with little in the way of fact behind them that are meant to inspire paranoia.  From the popularity of this book it would appear that much of the public is eating it up.  It is oh so fashionable to pile on the Catholic church right now.<br />Why?  Even though that nasty business with the Crusades is far behind them, the church has much &quot;splainin&quot; to do with those mounting molestation charges.<br />Mr. Brown has produced a flimsy, mediocre, opportunist, and mercenary novel.  He is a genius in the same way that Madonna is a genius.<br />The new-age definition for genius:  Anyone who can sniff out a trend, exploit and capitalize on it with little regard for truth, artistic value, or the repercussions of their actions.
B00008EYA5|3.0|\\"S.W.A.T.\\" has at least one thing going for it - it's a lot better than the old TV series it is based on. Unlike most other recent action films, it tries hard give a little depth to it characters, but it ultimately fails because the script is as formula as they come and because the events it portrays are utterly unbelievable. <br />As the movie opens, a S.W.A.T. team has been dispatched to the scene of a horrific bank robbery / hostage situation. The team saves the day. In the course of doing so, one of the officers wounds a hostage. That officer and his partner, Jim Street [Colin Farrell], are called on the carpet because the victim of the gunshot is suing for `millions of dollars'. The officer who fired the shot quits and becomes a vindictive drunk, and  Street gets demoted to doing menial tasks. [How's that for formula? Movies have been going this route since `Dirty Harry\\" in 1971.] Salvation for Street comes in the form of `Hondo' Harrelson [Samuel Jackson], who has been called back to S.W.A.T. to improve the department's tarnished image. He chooses Street and several other officers to make an `elite' team. Meanwhile, an international gangster [Oliver Martinez] is arrested, and as he is lead off to jail, offers $100,000,000 to anyone who can bust him out. Suddenly all the bad guys come out of the woodwork hoping for the reward. As in all lazily written scripts, the bad guys have all this information and equipment that in real life they could not possibly have. The elite team has its hands full, but it's all just an excuse for another series of car chases and explosions. <br />I don't mean to be so `down' on \\"S.W.A.T\\". As such movies go these days, it's sometimes exciting. My laments these days are two-fold. The first is that modern action movies play like video games. The second is that they take themselves so seriously. Since the scenario is so outlandish, where is the humor? Where are the inside jokes? Do the people who make this stuff truly believe they are mirroring reality? Or do they believe that they are reflecting what the audience thinks  reality to be?
0312263120|1.0|After reading this book, I was disappointed and decided not to buy into his &quot;D.V. Code&quot; hype. <BR>The reasons I don't like this book:<BR>(1) The plot itself is very dull, the setting was very plain and no real suspense at al. Once I read that Susan Fletcher (the main character) stress over and over and over again that it is simply against the mathematical law to have unbreakable code, I immediately suspected that there are in fact no such a code. There must be a hack somehow setup the plot to make people buy into this hype and hide some other virus in his &quot;code&quot; to divert your attention. Once you are focusing on &quot;breaking&quot; of this code, his code may be doing far more damage than you first would thought of.<BR>As you see, I guessed this from the very beginning, and it turned out that this is the plot! Damn! How cheasy is that!<br />(2)The effort Susan's boyfriend (David Becker) trying to retrieve the ring from Spain is totally irrelevant to the story... You can simply skip reading all these short chapters and focus only on what's going on in the NSA building. The love story portraited was very plain and you have to be a real fool to believe David's luck to retrieve a ring back in that short time.<br />(3)It's unbelievably stupid for the NSA deputy director to buy into a laid-off worker's dull plot and never suspect all those hours passed was simply some programming loop. The way he even contact Japanese businessman to try to sell the stuff make you feel like the author is trying to insult your intelligence.<br />Just save your money. Trust me!
B00008J4P5|4.0|I had the chance to run Elephant through another couple times this weekend.  I gave it only 2 stars earlier.  I stand by that rating when setting Elephant in the context of our musical universe.  BUT - that may be unfair.  White Stripes has a garage band sound.  They do it quite well.   The CD is growing on me.<br />I give Elephant 4 stars on the garage band scale.  Worth a spin if that's your style.  What's my style?  Not garage, but Elephant may expand my tastes a bit.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|when i first got this album, i wasn't really that into it. but then one day i decided taht i would pop it back into my cd player, because i was on a neil young kick, and listened to the other albums i have about a million times already. so after listentng to it for the second time, i realized that this is the best album neil young has ever done. and i mean that flat out. i own all of youngs essential stuff, everybody knows, after the gold rush, harvest, on the beach, tonights the night, rust never sleeps, ragged glory, zuma, and mirror ball. and this album really has so much more feeling to it than any of the above listed. the real standout songs are falling from above, carmichael, leave the driving, bandit, grandpas interview(which is probably one of the best songs neil has ever written) sun green, and be the rain. while there is no way for a new fan to get into this, this is without a doubt oen of neils greatest achievements.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Siamese is the best rock album of all time...period...this cd is perfect in every single way, and explores all areas of rock in roll, all in one cd.....it has rock, lullaby, hard rock, you name it, it has it.....billy corgan basically recorded this entire album by himself other than drums...which shows how much of a genius he is...you need this album
B0000025JT|5.0|I was homesick for this album when I heard a few coffebreakers talking about Barbarra Streisand but no one seemed to know anything about &quot;Guilty,&quot; which is unfortunate because if you must own a piece of the Diva, this one is it.  I actually bought the original album with the lyrics and numerous pictures of Gibb and Streisand in white.  That was back in junior high and I wished I took better care of my stuff and have saved it.  The CD quality is okay, it isn't remastered, but with today's high tech elelctronics, you can still get the beautiful sound.  This CD is chuck full of beautiful ballads, with a Kareoke-like dreaminess and smaltzy lyrics.  You find yourself singing along with lyrics like &quot;I am a woman in love and I'll do anything to get you into my world and hold you within,...&quot; just make sure you are lone in your car or the kids are playing outside, it possess you with hopeless abandon.  So, it doesn't matter if you bought it 23 years ago or just yesterday, it still has the same whoozy effects.  You can't help appreciating Streisand's rendition of Barry Gibb's peotic lyrics.  And the best thing is that Streisand is not over the top screaming or strecthing her voice, none of that &quot;Yentl&quot; stuff.  She is just right in this CD, soft pitch, full of feelings, letting her voice carry naturally.  She has a gorgeous voice, this much I have to admit, being a non Streisand fan. <br />You will also appreciate the instrumentations.  Lee Ritenour lends his jazzy guitar in songs like &quot;Promises&quot; and &quot;Life Story.&quot; Good choice.  &quot;Guilty&quot; and &quot;What Kind of Fool&quot;  are the two duets with Gibb.  Each voice completes the other in amorous melodies.  What can I say,  I am a sucker for this stuff.  Hope that doesn't make me old school, but then again, I probably don't care.
B000002OZY|5.0|Unlike most people I don't get my knickers into too much of a twist over the filler in the album. I of course can see there point of view and to an extent agree, but I find the filler to be forgivible because  this was the first rock opera and when you are creating somthing that nobody has ever done before it usually gets dated faster. And there aren't many albums that don't have alot of filler anyway especially ones that are albums and not collections of singles. And after all the Who did improve their talents on the rock opera later didn't they? So I would recomend this one to anyone who loves The Who or would like to own a piece of rock history.<br />After reading the reviews of this album I have now read the stupidest quote since someone told me that The Beatles music releases should be the American versions instead of the UK because The Beatles were an all American band. But I must say that The Who being influenced by bands whose members probably weren't born before Tommy's release(like Oasis and Hanson) takes the cake. What's next the Rolling Stones album Let it Bleed was inspired from The Strokes or The Fountains of Wayne?

B0000DD7NL|5.0|I must say I love Ms. Keys' style on this one!  She has such a smooth sound to her music.  It is good to hear some lyrics that don't have any cuss words in them.  And how refreshing it is to hear the vocal talents of an actual musician/artist rather than an entertainer!  Thanks for blessing us with this Alicia!
B00005A46T|1.0|Dictionary.com seems to think that the term music means: &quot;The art of arranging sounds in time so as to produce a continuous, unified, and evocative composition, as through melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.&quot;<br />I've never been one for the hardcore music like Korn and Disturbed as a lot of it seems like noise to me, though I can see reasons for people liking both. But sometimes bands cross the line, Slipknot seems to have ignored everything that defines music, and while that seems like a novel idea what the band comes down to is the same guitar riffs over and over again and something that sounds like someone knocking over a bunch of garbage cans in an alley.<br />This is NOT music, if you want metal there's bound to be a band out there who delivers better than this.
0440224764|2.0|\\"The Partner,\\" John Grisham's 1997 crime novel about a superlawyer on the lam pitted against his beautiful but shallow wife, his well-connected but shallow former law partners, and the military-industrial-political-financial-legal-insurance-press complex of the entire Western world, is decent beach reading.  No more, no less.<br />Told largely through flat, deposition-style dialogue -- a narrative technique, as old as Richardson, in which characters tell a story simply by relating to each other what happened before the novel began -- the book features a heavily diagrammed (and largely implausible) plot, morally ambiguous characters, swatches of local color (here, the Mississippi Gulf Coast and Brazil), plenty of cynicism about the motives of powerful men, and a final twist that, because of the limited character development, rings false.<br />Graham Greene's standard of literary criticism was defined by a question: is there anyone in this book you'd care to invite to lunch?  I don't think so here.  Grisham aficionados may find \\"The Partner\\" to die for. For anyone else, save this talky book for a lazy day at the beach.  Robert E. Olsen
B00005JL78|5.0|The malicious sense of visceral fun and gallows humor that made Steven Speilberg's JAWS so irresistible have miraculously returned to the director after productive stints in World War II films and gentle fables.  MINORITY REPORT is his best film in years, retaining the chilly futurism of AI while injecting it with a feverish energy that recalls the INDIANA JONES films.  And its obsession with issues of guilt and security give it a distinctly post-9/11 sensibility.  Although it's a bit long and contains one false ending too many, its sense of pace and devotion to ghoulish subplots and effects keep things humming.  Speilberg's star, Tom Cruise, has been stripped of all mannerisms and affectations.  His is an engaging, surprisingly moving performance.  It is rare to find a film that gracefully (and somewhat effortlessly) balances action and thought, violence and meditation, adventure and philosophy.  MINORITY REPORT is such a film.
B00005JM02|1.0|Finding Nemo is most certainly one of the worst movies ever made. Another trainwreck by Pixar studios.  Lacking an actual plot the movie focuses on the struggles of Marlin, a fish, trying to find his fishy son.  Why anyone would care about this misguided quest is beyond me. However the story ends I dont know considering the movie is about as boring as they come. The movie is full of terrible attempts at comedy leaving you wanting to throw a brick at whatever projection device is showing the rubbish. Add a few celebrity voices and there you have it, the formula for quite possibly the most annoying piece of garbage ever.  The animation isnt bad until you think about what its being used to animate. The only thing this movie did for me was to increase my support for the commercial fishing industry.  Had Nemo been mechanically seperated and put into a can of tuna the movie may have been entertaining. Everyone do yourself a favor and instead of watching this nonsense rent yourself a classic- The Barber directed by Michael Bafaro
B00005JKJA|5.0|BLUE VELVET was extraordinary, an exploration of the dark sides of both sex and the small town that none of us were prepared for.  TWIN PEAKS was a dazzlingly fun pit stop, a total dead-end that I would gladly travel again and again, if only<BR>for the corny jokes amidst the psychotic terror.  But <BR>MULHOLLAND DR is surely David Lynch's masterpiece.  Of all the movies that bite the hand that feeds them, Hollywood, MULHOLLAND DR is the only one that deserves a place<BR>alongside SUNSET BLVD.  But where SUNSET BLVD is brittle and cynical, MULHOLLAND DR is overwhelmingly warm, filled with deep, rich colors, remarkably pure expressions of<BR>love and fear and sadness, and a love scene so hot and unexpected it scalds you.  This warmth and beauty make the film's (literal) decomposition (set off by a stunning scene set in a crumbling theatre) all the more shocking and powerful.  Of course, Naomi Watts's shattering performance helps, too.  Her work in the first part of the film, playing a naive Hollywood hopeful, splinters and cracks brilliantly in the film's second part.  But, at its core, MULHOLLAND DR is a particularly American tragedy.  For behind the glitter is betrayal, behind the mic is a lip-syncher, and the smell of a rotting town clouds any hope of becoming a starlet.
B00005JMFO|5.0|There hasn't been a film like this for a while. It's about relationships between lovers,young and old, husbands and wifes,  brothers and sisters and fathers and sons not to mention, friend to friend. A quick scene to scene story line, chopping and changing between the individual stories, which all evolve and combine towards the end. Quite cleverly done and written.It can take you on an emotionally up and down journey, but one worth every minute. You'll walk out feeling a warmth in your heart.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown's novel Th DaVinci Code was truely enjoyable to read! I found myself unable to put this book down once I had started it. Although some of the characters are predictable, I didn't feel that this aspect took away from the quality of the story.<br />I am currently reading the predicessor to this novel, Angels &amp; Demons (also starring Robert Langdon) and am having difficulty putting this one down as well! I do hope that this will turn into a book series about Robert Langdon.
0872860175|1.0|I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, staring hysterical      .  Awesome line, one of the best i've come across, but there isn't much more that's remotely appealing about Howl.  I know that it's supposed to be vulgar and cruel, but it just isn't worth your time.  And the price is outrageous for what you get, about what would be ten or fifteen pages of text on normal sized paper, and only a handfull of good lines.  I wasted my money on it.  Why not go check out Lilith, Phantastes, Dave Weckel Band, or Cat's Cradle for some real poetry, if that's the sort of person you are.
B000000H3Z|5.0|True masterpieces are exceptionally rare in the Thrash/Death genre, but this happens to be one of them.  Beneath the Remains is no doubt Sepultura's best album, and one of the top thrash metal albums of all time.  This is Sepultura the way they are supposed to be... Before the tribal gimmick, before the ridiculous Korn influence, before Max leaving to form a rap-nu-metal band... This was their high water mark.  <BR>Their previous album, Schizophrenia, is just a taste of what lies in store with this one.  Along with a much better sound quality, Beneath the Remains is a lot more focused and confident in its own sound.  The riffs are far better than ever, and also more numerous.  The songs are also much more balanced, perfectly mixing the right amount of melody with pure brutality. At first I was hoping there would be an instrumental track to balance the album out a bit, but after listening to the album, I realized it didn't need any more balance than it already had. This is one mean album to say the least.  Songs such as &quot;Inner Self&quot;(my favorite), &quot;Stronger than Hate&quot;, &quot;Mass Hypnosis&quot;, and &quot;Slaves of Pain&quot; will really get you into a thrashin' frenzy.  That's not to say that any of the other songs here won't do the same thing, since there are really no weak tracks on this album.  <BR>The big question is &quot;Arise, or Beneath the Remains?&quot; Coming from a Thrash point of view, Beneath the Remains is superior in every way.  It's faster, it's heavier, it's better.  I recommend picking up Arise as well, as it is their last good album, but it really can't compete against this one.  Chaos AD was the beginning of the end, and everything after that is terrible. Unless you like Korn and Nu-metal, then by all means, pick up Roots and everything after it.  For the true metal fan, I can't recommend this album enough.

B0000UHFC6|5.0|As commented in many of the reviews already, many elements are missing or cut short in this release -- but one must realize that this is merely 70 minutes out of a score written for a 200-minute film, and this does include the to-be-released extra footage (another hour!).  So, looking at it this way, this is a great compilation of themes that will really bring the film back to you.  Particularly enchanting is the &quot;Gray Havens&quot; theme -- used also in the Lennox song.  Listen for the 'cellos at the end of the 2nd-to-last track---gorgeous!!!  And &quot;Into the West&quot; has lyrics directly from Tolkien himself, so I do not know if one could easily designate them &quot;fluffy.&quot;  They are just what Tolkien wrote (which may indeed be fluffy -- but don't regard this as a pop invention).  You WILL enjoy this purchase!

6301868684|4.0|Last Exit to Brooklyn tells a story the way it needs to be told...realistically. This film is not for everyone. If you can't accept the fact that some people do behave like this than this film is not for you. Everyone doesn't live in a fantasy land and Last Exit to Brooklyn shows this. People brought up in conditions like these or who are familiar with people such as this can vouch that people are truly like this in some places. It may not be an excuse for how others act but it is real and this film proves that. This is a powerful, moving film not to be looked upon if you're easily offended out of your own ignorance and live in a rose-colored world. If you have the ability to watch a movie, understand it and be taken in with what the film represents ( without feeling threatened ) then this movie is a keeper. If you can't see that Last Exit to Brooklyn deplicts reality for people other than the super fortunate, rent Sweet Home Alabama because this movie is not for you.
B00006SFLV|5.0|My So Called Life deserves more than 5 stars. It was and always will be the greatest tv show ever made. It makes absolutley no sense why it was cancelled. MSCL fans (including myself) will always be upset about the mistake ABC made. I mean a show nominated and winning Golden Globes and Emmys getting cancelled? It just doesnt make sense. Angela Chase is the most honest and real character I've ever seen in any TV shows or movies. I'll always be upset that MSCL was cancelled and the last we saw of the show was Angela getting into Jordan's car and Brian watching, but it could all be for the best. MSCL wasn't given the opportunity to turn into another stupid, sappy teenage soap opera. But we were all robbed of MSCL's greatness. We'll never know what could have been. We'll never know what My So Called Life could have achieved, who Angela would end up with, and how each character's life would change. We didn't even get the chance to see if Rayanne and Angela would be friends again.It is all very ironic. Right when you're getting to know and love something it is taken away and the rest is a mystery. Just like life itself. My So Called Life was a lesson to all of us. It taught us about life, love, friendship, and just getting through the day, staying true to yourself. It was and always will be the most honest tv show and example of life ever made.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Revised for Blu-ray:The Blu-ray edition of \\"Aliens\\" features a stunning looking transfer. Yes, it does still have film grain (well, it should-it was shot on film and removing the grain using digital noise reduction would also remove much of the fine detail). Fox has done a masterful job of transferring this for its Blu-ray debut.<br /><br />The Blu-ray includes both versions of the film--the original theatrical cut as well as the extended version.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good in its presentation here. Audio sounds positively stunning at times with a nice immersive mix of the soundtrack (for a film of its time).<br /><br />Cameron did the smart thing with Aliens--go in a completely different direction from Ridley Scott's film and create something unique that still had his signature on it. In fact, Cameron already had a story he had written with the same basic premise--it just didn't have Ripley nor did it have the Aliens from the film series. He adapted it and made it work for this terrific 5 star sequel.<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />The big difference is the commentary track from Cameron and various cast and crew members. This is kind of a slice and dice commentary. You get Cameron one minute, the main cast (with the curious exception of Paul Reisner and Weaver), producer Gale Anne Hurd and make up/creature effects wizard Stan Winston. It's a terrific commentary track and there isn't a lot of dead space so clearly this approach will work for most fans of the film. If you wanted to hear Cameron the entire time, well you're out of luck.<br /><br />The extras are pretty indepth including Cameron's original story treatment and every from pre to post production footage and information. It's a great package.The film wasn't shot using anamorphic lenses (in fact a lot of Cameron's early features weren't shot in anamorphic widescreen because of the difficulty of lighting the optical effects among many other things but you'll hear more about that in the commentary section). This is presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />There are some minor compression issues. Since Aliens was shot on film stock that was very grainy (it was a new film stock and you'll notice a lot of films from the time with a similar look). It actually enhances the feel and look of the film capturing the Vietnam era references that Cameron was making with the film. So it was grainy before and still looks that way.<br /><br />Using a format called Extended Branching allows both versions of the film to be on the same dual layered DVD at the same time and saves disc space. I noticed a comment about the lack of a DTS soundtrack. My understanding is that Cameron was very happy with the sound on the original release and had no desire to fiddle with this version.<br /><br />All in all a terrific version of the movie. The packaging is probably going to be better here as the Quadrilogy had a fold out accordian format which I hate.al 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  ABOUT THE DVD:  There are some minor compression issues.

B000001ESN|5.0|Permanent Waves is a musical masterpiece and for me the absolute zenith of Rush. In more or less 35 minutes it manages to include everything from catchy, compelling and explosive -yet complex- \\"radio hits\\" to surging epic pieces, full of instrumental wizardry that will leave your ears ringing for quite some time after the actual music has ended. To balance it out there are also a couple of songs with a mellower feel to them, only adding to the overall musical flexibility on display here. Monotonous is NOT a word to be used, when describing this record. <br />Contrary to what my fellow countryman beneath me is saying, there is a whole lot more to behold here than the first two tracks. One really needs to LISTEN to be able to appreciate all the nyances and finer points this grandiose musical journey has to offer. Take my word for it; once you get it, you REALLY get it, and there is no turning back after that. It has you hooked for good.<br />Jacob's Ladder, one of my absolute favorites, is a composition I've yet to find accurate words to describe in order to make it any kind of justice. It's simply unique -as is the entire record. If you want an introduction to Rush, there is no better place to start than Permanent Waves. This one has it all.

B00005JMCT|2.0|Once Steve Stifler appears on screen, you realize that everyone else in the movie is just there for scenery.  Stifler is the movie.  Wedding?  What wedding?  It takes a backseat to Stifler on the onslaught of profanity and nudity.  Is that a bad thing?  Not necessarily, but the movie really reaches to get it's laughs.  Some are genuine, but many are very forced.  I wouldn't say that this movie is a failure.  It just tries too hard to recapture the glory of the first film.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This is indeed a great album. It brings you back to a time when heavy metal was more than just 2 badly played chords repeated over and over again (hem, hem, mettalica...). Bon Scott sounds like a chain smoking, curse yelling, 90 year old WWI veteran, which is to say, absolutely AWESOME. Angus Young lays down some of his best guitar playing ever. Along with Back In Black, this is the best AC/DC album you can get.

B00005JMCW|4.0|This video was lying around my house during the holidays, so I decided to pop it into my DVD player.  I remember seeing clips of it in the past, and I instantly wrote it off as a cheesy teeny-bopper movie.  I couldn't have been further off base with both assessments.<br />The acting in this movie is top notch.  The role reversal is done so exceptionally well, that I was 100% convinced Jamie Lee Curtis had morphed into Lindsay Lohen's body, and vice versa.  Besides the great acting, the story was fun, not really any really dull parts.  It was funny, heartwarming, and was a very entertaining movie for the whole family.<br />Nicely done.
B00004Z400|5.0|First of all, I must ask why alot of the people who reviewed this album said the lyrics were evil. The only thing I've ever noticed is that the lyrics are cryptic if anything. I guess everyone has their own definition of &quot;evil&quot;. Cannibal Corpse's lyrics are evil, pansies. Anywho, this is a great album as we all know. I really can't pick a favorite Deftones album. Chino has the greatest voice I've ever heard.<br />Back To School 8/10 - This song is pretty catchy. I didn't like it at first because it has &quot;rap&quot; parts but it grew on me.<br />Feiticeira 9/10 - I remember that this was one of the first songs that i liked from this album. Someone said the lyrics are meaningless, I guess some people can't interpret them. The lyrics paint a nice portrait in my head.<br />Digital Bath 9/10 - Excellent song. Would have given it a 10 but I think it drags on a bit too long at the end.<br />Elite 10/10 - Great song. I think watching them rehearse this on the cd extra feature is what made me instantly love this.<br />rx queen 10/10 - sweet song, great lyrics.<br />street carp 6/10 - the chorus kinda sucks. good riffs though.<br />teenager 8/10 - nice song, different.<br />knife prty 9/10 - great song, would be better if they didnt have some lady howling in the background reminding me of Pink Floyd.<br />Korea 10/10 - This song should have been a single. It's my favorite song on the album. Awesome lyrics, awesome riffs, awesome vocals. Put together very nicely.<br />Passenger 7/10 - Exceptional song but I think Maynard is overated, ooh, i can sense everyone getting mad about that last comment, who cares, he is. I usually skip this track.<br />Change 9/10 - This song rocks, the ending goes on and on though. Gets to be too repetitive.<br />Pink Maggot 11/10 - I know i said Korea was my fave song but this one may be my fave, maybe it's a tie. This is one of the best closers to an album ever. This song can send chills down your spine the first few times you listen to it, it's just a spectacular song.

B00009TB5G|5.0|The first image of 2002's *The Two Towers* is that of a snowy vista, deep within the rock-chain of the Misty Mountains.  Wreathed in sunset colors, this brief panorama is at once cold, imperious, and hauntingly pristine. Howard Shore's melancholic strings both articulate and enhance the mood intended: a moment of calm - of natural, pure-earth stillness - before the coming darkness, the storms and tribulations that threaten the ancient fields of Middle-Earth. <br />The camera shifts away and we, the audience, are sent upon a slow, ominous journey across eroded ridge and ice-sheet; voices emerge, dreamlike, full of remembrance past.  Then the dream shifts to nightmare, and we are thrust back to the climax of *Fellowship of the Ring,* watching two Maia duel upon the bridge of Khazad-dum.  One cannot help but feel a sort of tragic inevitability viewing this confrontation, a sort of \\"pathos rehashed:\\" Gandalf is whipped down into the shroud, as before... but instead of wailing hobbits and heartrending music to jog a tear from the eye, the camera instead follows the wizard on his plunge into the depths of the earth.  Gandalf grasps his sword, fierce determination stark upon his wizened face. Ferocious chanting roils up from the sound-mix, augmenting the rising tension, foretelling a clash of angelic and daemonic titans. The subsequent battle is a dizzying, wrenching blend of shaky-cam, stunning CGI prowess and gut-punch editing; just as Gandalf and the Balrog are smashed through stone and the cold waters of an underground lake, so in turn are we, the fickle audience, brought crashing into the second chapter of the Lord of the Rings.<br />This opening is my favorite of 2002, and possibly of all time.  Not only do I find the Gandalf/Balrog clash incredibly effective - even awe-inspiring - as a piece of popcorn spectacle, this scene *exemplifies* the current peak of technological advancement the film industry is now experiencing...and Gollum, our sweet schizophrenic \\"precious,\\" goes beyond any CGI character to date.  0's and 1's combine to create something that actually feels alive, suffering and breathing before our very eyes, opposed to so many other computer caricatures. Gollum was a mighty gamble for Peter Jackson and his collaborators: in a cast of basic archetypes, his is one of the most complex roles, something not normally assigned to the late-hour skills of computer animators. <br />That they pulled it off, and so well, came as a surprise initially, but not in hindsight.  Jackson's LotR combines the \\"classical\\" style of 20th century epic-filmmaking - breathtaking vistas, carefully-wrought melodrama, larger than life heroes and villains coupled with small, quiet moments of drama - all the while incorporating the digital tools of the 21st century on such a compellingly *emotional* level that it has no problem ensnaring the audience into a fantastical environment without alienating them by the oft-plasticity \\"shine\\" that infects so much use of CGI.  The pathos of Smeagol/Gollum, the peril of the Two Towers, the plight of Middle-Earth and its varied peoples...these threads captivate us, pull at the heart-strings with the fingerwork of a master-puppeteer.<br />Now with that said... as I settled in to watch this Extended Edition, my expectations soared; my excitement was hard to contain.  Fellowship was a masterwork, made even better by its Extended Edition, yet I had found the second chapter unsatisfactory in the theater.  TTT bulged uncomfortably at its seams, the editing somewhat choppy, the slice-in-dice cuts quite obvious: there was simply too much story for a `mere' 3 hours (!) to properly elucidate.  Jerky pacing plagued the first hour, with certain transitions almost painful in their reveal of the drastic butcher-work used to shave the movie into a respectable length.  Even the ending, although magnificent in design, came to a too-abrupt denouement, a hurried wrap-up that left one acutely aware of all that missing.  <br />Itis obvious to me now that Peter Jackson et al. had the extended possibilities of the DVD in mind while scripting and crafting these films: in Extended Edition form, TTT finally feels *complete,* fully realized in a way that the theatrical edition could only hint at.  Moreover, TTT is now the worthy successor of the first chapter, equal to and in some ways surpassing FotR in terms of character, scope and epic-style storytelling.<br />A few improvement examples:<br />Faramir, perhaps *the* greatest sticking point, is fully redeemed here.  His very first scene in the Extended is more true to the book-character than _anything_ in the theatrical.  The flashback scene helps to change Faramir from an ambiguous and self-serving rascal to a learned but conflicted man, one struggling with his place and destiny in a world gone mad.<br />Eowyn is fleshed out in a few extra scenes: her final confession to Aragorn peaks her character-arc and sets the foundation for her role in the final movie.<br />Out of all the myriad storylines, the thread of Merry and Pippin in Fangorn Forest easily benefits the most from the Extended treatment.  The new scenes help bridge a much-needed *consistency* to this vital subplot thread; while in the theatrical the \\"other\\" hobbits were reduced to mere footnotes, here Merry and Pip help balance out the comical equation (the pipe-weed scene was especially endearing) while setting in motion one of the most important military coups of the battle for Middle Earth. <br />The extras are voluminous, covering many of the important factors of film-creation, including editing, sound, and CGI.  The documentaries also reveal how stressful TTT was to make: stuck between the beginning and concluding chapters, TTT was the pillar between: it had to stand strong and cast its shadow long.  <br />Overall, the additional time restored to TTT make it weightier, more resonant, a stronger film as a whole.  Scenes are allowed to breath, characters to develop, conflict to rise and peak upon the walls of Helm's Deep.  Although it has neither a true \\"beginning\\" nor \\"end,\\" the Extended Edition of TTT is a masterpiece in its own right, and the perfect middle-chapter for the LotR trilogy.  Five Stars.

B00001ZWTT|4.0|So I was perusing the reviews for this movie before getting a copy and I must say that in regards to this movie, people came to the table with far too high expectations for this movie and had them in completely different areas in which this movie really shone.  The particularly vitriolic reviewers here should have known beforehand that a vehicle piloted by Will Smith with Kevin Kline riding shotgun would *not* be the next &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;  I knew this the first time I saw the commericals for this movie, but went to see it anyway.  I'm proud to be one of the thirty five people in America to have paid $7.50 for this movie and plan to shell out about twenty more for the DVD.  It was not a waste to me.  I do not regret seeing this movie at all in theaters.  &quot;T3&quot; and &quot;Matrix: Reloaded&quot; however....<br />I suppose my particular attraction to Wild Wild West was summed up quite well by a former reviewer who described it as &quot;enjoyable&quot; but not &quot;good.&quot;  You must have this attitude to enjoy this movie, otherwise you cringe at what should elicit a throaty chuckle.  Of course the movie is miscast, even though Branaugh's and Kline's performances taken at face value are enjoyable.  Of course there couldn't be &quot;big metal spiders&quot;, etc. back then.  This still doesn't keep this movie from being a fun, campy joyride that will probably engender a cult following in years to come.  Wild Wild West is the Plan 9 of the 90's.<br />My recommendation: watch it on TV first.  Yes, they still show it.  They also show the TV movies made from the original TV show.  Believe me, they aren't much better, despite what the WWW purists may say.  If you like the free experience, then by all means get the DVD.  But the Wild Wild West experience is not for the casual buyer.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I just watched this movie the other night for the first time and was completely engrossed.  The storyline simply draws you in from the first moment and keeps you there.  Not only that, but the artistry is beyond stunning to look at.  If you love a good story and/or you love animie, this is the movie for you.<BR>The only downside is that I would not let my 9-year-old son watch it.  I thought there would be parts in there that would be alittle too &quot;much&quot; for him.  Just keep that in mind if you have kids around.  They could easily identify with the main character... on some moments in the film that may be scary for younger kids.

B000089RVR|5.0|Dido's &quot;Life For Rent&quot; brings us exquisitely into the realm of superior chill-out pop music. She has proven once again that she is an artist to be respected, and if any evidence were needed, this album amply provides it.<br />Every song on &quot;Life For Rent&quot; is good. It is an album which works best listened to all the way through, but listening to just a song or two at random still manages to serve as a powerful aural experience. The lyrics are poignant, the hooks are astounding, and the orchestrations are lush, soothing and beautiful. Dido has co-written every track on the album, and it shows what a great lyricist she is, as well as being a pleasant singer.<br />The lead single is the first track, &quot;White Flag&quot;, and it builds into a crescendo of heartrending words and sounds. The emotions are beautifully evident. Another great track for this same experience is &quot;Stoned&quot;, which is lush and gorgeous. And &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot; has to count as one of the best songs of 2003. Its meaning is so deep and powerful, and the way it works itself up and then breaks into the chorus is absolutely astounding and is sure to give chills to its listeners. Dido also caters to her funky side a little, with tracks such as &quot;Who Makes You Feel&quot;, with its slightly funky beat and drop vocals.<br />The chill-out genre of music can often times convey an emotional 'sense', but still lack that certain 'something' required to push a song into greatness. Pop music, conversely, often tries to convey emotion to the Nth degree, but quite often hits the wrong notes and falls flat. With &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, Dido proves to us that the chill-out/pop hybrid is a wonderful thing, and can accomplish alluring music with deep, meaningful lyrics for the emotional satisfaction that we often seek, but so rarely find.

1400049628|5.0|I thought I knew everything there was about being a man from rereading Fight Club over and over. I was dead wrong. Brawling and Anarchistic Mischief are fun, but not very handy when several dozen flesh eating zombies storm into your quiet little suburb.<BR>I pulled my copy of the book out of the bloody grasp of some unfortunate fool who apparantly hadn't finished it yet (or didn't take the advice to heart). Lucky for me we we able to fight off the undead army until we had time to establish a fort, train as a group, and make our escape into safer territory. <BR>I write this now from a T-Mobile Hot Spot at a local Borders from my laptop. I thank God I found this book every day. Gotta go now. Zombies just burst through the glass and are devouring the women lingering in the Romance section...
B00008AWOD|5.0|ever since I was exposed to this band I found myself hopelessly hypnotized by them. my first experience was with 'without you im nothing' then black market music. 'without you' was so finely crafted that I didn't hold too much hope for their other cds, but was so addicted to it I had to take the chance. black market was all I hoped it to be. a worthy sequel to their previous epic. I had heard sleeping with ghosts was different from the bands other outings, so I was skeptical at first. their sound was so good and worked so well before, would it still be any good different? as is obvious by my rating, yes. placebo is one of those rare bands that doesn't succeed because of their sound, but because of their raw talent. every song is full of soaring melodies that bring you way up, and far down all at the same time. each song is like a drug injected right into your veins and addicts you to it's rhythms right from the start. the feelings I get when I hear &quot;Plasticine&quot; are inspirational to say the least. I can't recommend it enough. however, if your one who liked only the heavy guitar saturated songs of 'without you' and didn't care for the slower ones in-between, I recommend sticking to black market music for now.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Resident Evil is the best thing ever. From the video games to the movie and even the soundtrack. Everything that has anything to do with Resident Evil is great.

0393057658|5.0|It seems that the hardcore baseball fan cannot go anywhere these days without seeing a reference to &quot;The Billy Beane Book&quot;.  Often, however, it seems as though the people discussing this book have not taken the time to account for the minute detail of actually reading the book before using it in discussion.<br />As a story-teller, author Lewis does a surperb job of piecing together a part of baseball's history that until recently has not been cast under the light that it truly deserves.  The history I am refering to is the world of sabermetrics, the exploration of the truly fascinating world of baseball statistics.  Even in discussing what to the average fan would surely be a truly boring topic at first glance, Lewis' writing abilities are more than capable of keeping the pages turning at a fervent pace.<br />For this reason alone the book is worth recommending, but for the avid baseball fan looking for a more in depth look at the American Pastime, there is surely another world readily available for discovery located within these pages.

6303823351|5.0|This is the quintessential Beatles movie.  This is the Boys as they were: Silly, witty, and extremely sarcastic.<br />I would not be surprised if HELP! was the first movie to feature the format that is nowadays referred to as music videos.  They were great at their music and although they may not have been the best actors on the planet, the humor and delivery of their lines is hard to beat.<br />An enjoyable movie for Beatlemanics, past and present.
6305882592|5.0|&quot;Harold &amp; Maude&quot; must be my favorite movie of all time.  I've probably seen it at least 40 times.  Perhaps that's why the DVD wound up under this year's Christmas tree for me.  Director Hal Ashby does a wonderful job with this offbeat flick.  After winning a Best Editing Oscar for &quot;In the Heat of the Night,&quot; this was Ashby's 2nd film as director to be followed by an impressive list of classics, &quot;Coming Home,&quot; &quot;Shampoo,&quot; &quot;The Last Detail,&quot; &quot;Bound for Glory,&quot; and &quot;Being There&quot; before he died of cancer in 1988.  Not a frame is wasted.<br />Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are magnificent as the leads in this unlikely love story.  Gordon who won an Oscar for &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; is full of life as Dame Marjorie Chardam or Maude.  She gets the classic lines, &quot;How the world still dearly loves a cage,&quot; and &quot;It's best to aim above morality; otherwise you got nothing to talk about in the locker room.&quot;  Bud Cort as wide-eyed Harold draws us inside his heart, despite the incredibly bizarre suicidal behavior.  But as is referenced several times in the lines, &quot;It's absurd&quot;; and H&amp;M is an absurdist film, showing alienation from society.<br />The richness of the film is reflected in the great care with the minor characters.  Charles Tyner as Uncle Victor is described as General MacArthur's &quot;right hand man,&quot; only to be shown as a military officer whose right hand has been amputated.  Vivian Pickles is incredible as Harold's mother, one who lives in her own world.  From the moment we see Harold hanging in the drawing room and his mother casually calling to reschedule her hair appointment, we know we are in for a very unusual look at competing values.<br />The three dates are each marvelous cameo performances.  Will Geer's daughter Ellen Geer who has also played in &quot;Clear &amp; Present Danger&quot; &amp; &quot;Patriot Games&quot; plays actress Sunshine Dore (Door actually!) who commits hari-kari.  Shari Summers as the wide eyed Edith Fern who sells chicken feed to not quite the whole Southwest gets to watch Harold chop off his hand with a clever.  Cort's smile as she exits is a perfect Mona Lisa.  Judy Engles who plays Candy and bubbles about majoring in Poli Sci as Harold apparently sets himself aflame is priceless as is her insane exit from frame.  Eric Christmas as the priest who starred in other odd classics like &quot;Porky's&quot; &amp; &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&quot; is marvelously revolting as he tells Harold that the thought of his young flesh commingling with Maude makes him want to vomit.<br />Harold &amp; Maude is so well loved for so many reasons.  Maude's odorifics where Harold smells snow is magical.  Maude's description of the lillies having so many observable differences when Harold comments that they're all the same is powerful, followed by her pointing to a graveyard and saying, &quot;I think much of the world's sorrow is from people who are actually this (flowers), but allow themselves to be treated as that (gravestones, dead).&quot;<br />The ultimate reason why &quot;Harold &amp; Maude&quot; is considered classic by so many is that it touches universal truths in our hearts.  Some can't get beyond the older woman, younger guy thing; and that's a shame.  Many of us will watch it another 40 times with equal delight!  Enjoy!r actually!) who commits hari-kari.

6304779356|5.0|I watched this movie on cable so many times in the late-80's and early 90's that I could recite every line in the movie from memory (still can).<br /><br />Indeed, one of the best vampire movies of all time.  Blood sucking, late-80's style: Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, Jason Patric, and the rest of the cast had great on screen chemistry that really came through and makes this movie a true classic.<br /><br />It is a dark comedy with elements of teenaged angst: The desire to fit in, a strong attraction to someone (dare we say a bit of love?).<br /><br />It's dated only in the sense that it reflects teen life of the late-1980's.  Other than that, The Lost Boys is just one of those movies you can never tire of watching.
B0000009SG|5.0|The myth is that if you liked the oldest Zappa albums made with the original Mothers of Invention, you were supposed to hate his stuff from this era.  Well, I'm here to tell you that it's nothing but a myth.  I love Freak Out, We're Only In It For The Money and all that old stuff, and I love Overnight Sensation too.  This album has an interesting mix of theme and execution.  The band was fully adept at the genres of guitar-driven rock and avant jazz.  The song lyrics were not written to solve the world's problems, but they were instead clear descriptions of the human condition, delivered with cynical, satirical wit.<br />Some of the lyrics from these tunes became essential phraseology for the keepers of the faith, those that locked into this incarnation of Zappa's band.  From Camarillo Brillo, it was: \\"Is that a real poncho or a Sears poncho?\\" and \\"We did it till we were unconcho, and it was useless anymore\\".  From Dina-moe-humm, it was: \\"How 'bout you, Fauna, ya wanna?\\" and \\"Sounds like you're chokin' on somethin'.\\"  And of course, \\"Gonna be a mental toss flycoon\\" from Montana.<br />Like Eddie said in the first Cruisers movie: \\"Words and music, Word-man\\" - and that's what makes Overnight Sensation the album it is.  Not the Dylan type poetry, because that wouldn't fit Frank's music in the first place.  Nope, it took one as unique as Zappa to write the incredible guitar on Dirty Love and combine it with the sexual perversions of poodle logic, yielding a masterpiece of fusion.  The entire album is consistently excellent, completely complete in every way.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Many might not like this movie because its slow and perhaps hard to follow. It involved crew memebers on a planet called solaris. Something was going wrong so they called in a Psychologist (George Clooney) to find out what was going on the planet Solaris (Sol r us..hehehe), a planet which made the crew memebers materialize their desires or memories. Whatever energy or entity was on this planet it was tapping into or experimenting with the human soul or consciousness. Perhaps it was changing the human makeup. A type of \\"CoEvolution\\";o)
B000083E79|5.0|I love this cd i bought it a few months ago and i just cant get enough of it its just GREAT, by the way for the people that think this is not a complete set of hits you can get the international version it has like 42 hits, THE very best of Cher is The BEST!
0446677450|5.0|This book has changed the way I think about my future. I recommend this book to all kids. Parents should get this book for all kids that are Juniors in High School. I wish someone bought me this book when I was in High school.
B0000DBJDM|2.0|The title is misleading since this is not a live concert with an audience.  The band playing in an empty outdoor stadium in the Pompei ampitheater.  There are weird video snipits of lava bubbling and band members running thru wierd landscapes.(one intresting interview with the band)<BR>In terms of the music on this DVD, you'll hear the band's experimentation with trance-like sound scapes but very little  structured songs or dicernible meolodies.  I suppose this DVD would be a must have for the Pink Floyd purist, but it' not my thing.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I found it nigh impossible to not think of the late Nick Drake when I first listened to this marvellous album. Further listenings draw comparisons to the Blue Nile and Lucinda Williams-lofty company for any musician to keep particularly on their first work. This is unquestionably the most complete album of the year, for many a year!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an amazing series cut short but worth every minute you spend viewing it. The DVD has some extras which frankly are not really worth the trouble and the audio commentary is a bit lacking. However, the fact is that this is one of the best sci-fi series in recent years and is really worth your attention.<br />I bought it. So should you.
B00008PW2D|2.0|I love the show but season five was not worth the forty dollars I paid for it. It should have been cheaper since we are only getting 8 episodes. I bought season five so that I would have a complete collectin.

0156027321|5.0|This is one of the better books I have read. It takes you on a spiritual journey and lets you freely question your own religion. You might be offended by some of the comments the author makes about Christianity, Muslims etc. but I think that is the whole beauty of it. <BR>The story of Pi is Amazing and unbelievable. A young man whose family was leaving their home in search for a better life is stranded in a life boat with very interesting companions. <BR>I absolutely loved the ending of this book, it made me look at the whole book and story from a totally different perspective.

B00000294R|5.0|I first heard this album when a mate bought it about 3 years ago and I knew straight away that I had to get a copy. L's lyrics are tight on every track and it doesn't matter how many times you hear it, it can never get repetitive or boring.<br />The album features 12 tracks with guest appearances by: Kid Capri on &quot;Put It On&quot;, the 8 Iz Enuff Crew on &quot;8 Iz Enuff&quot; and Jay-Z on &quot;Da Graveyard&quot;. The album kicks off with &quot;Put It On&quot;, and is one of my best tracks, it is also a perfect way to start the album with Big L expressing himself the way he intends to go on.<br />The second track on the album is &quot;MVP&quot; and was one of the tracks released as a single. L's delivery and flow throughout the song is second to none and on this track he really does show that he was the Most Valuable Poet.<br />Personally, I think that every track on the album is excellent, including \\"Da Graveyard\\" which features Jay-Z, but as much as I dislike Jay-Z's music, his delivery hear is much more impressive. The last track is \\"Let `Em Have It\\" which ends the album on a positive note with one of the best verses on the LP:<br />The Big L's back to attack with a phat rap<BR>Matter of fact black I'm puttin' Harlem on the map<BR>What's up cause I'm a stiggy star<BR>Breakin' 'em up and then talkin' they heart<BR>You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' microphones apart<BR>I'm undefeated that's the stone truth<BR>Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth<BR>I take lives with no pride<BR>I just committed a homicide <BR>A punk brother died cause he tried <BR>To take my cash but he didn't last<BR>I pulled out fast <BR>I tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass (boom)<BR>I make a lot of doe <BR>I'm quick to spot a foe<BR>Even if my grandma violates she gotta go<BR>When I was young I played with guns not a kiddy toy<BR>Cause I'm a ruff rugged gangsta not a pretty boy<BR>Facts on tracks I recite well<BR>Everybody be like Mike but Mike wanna be like L<br />I have read reviews where people complain about the beats and the fact that the lyrics are poor etc etc. No doubt these people sit around watching MTV and listening to rappers like 50 Cents who say they are 'keepin it real' when really they haven't a clue what hip-hop is all about and are only in it for the money.<br />Overall, I feel that every true hip-hop fan should have a copy of this album. It showcases Big L athis best and the album delivers 12 tracks that would make any rapper jealous. <br />Big L   1974 - 1999 RIP
B00005JM20|4.0|I'm getting very tired of great movies being marketed incorrectly.  Super Troopers is another great example of the idiocy of movie promoters.  Johnny English is a great spy movie.  It's got everything including a very sympathetic hero.  Rowan Atkinson is NOT Mr. Bean or Blackadder.  He is an actor and a darn good one as this movie very ably proves.  The movie is not over the top spoof like Austin Powers nor is it a serious spy movie like James Bond.  It's just a spy movie with a great plot, an evil bad guy, some pretty cool action scenes, some great comic moments, and a flawed hero.  The bad reviews and negative comments must be from people who were expecting an entirely different sort of movie. Watch with an open mind because I very highly recommend this movie to everyone, young and old, who likes an action movie with some laughs. I hope that producers take note of its success and give us more Johnny English in the future!
B000002TQV|4.0|Hmmmmm, gonna try to keep this short.<BR>Very strong album. Like others have said, lacks the scope and ambition of OK Computer, but that's totally understandable as -- hey! -- it came two (?) years prior. <br />The album begins with \\"Planet Telex\\", which to be honest is my least favorite song on the album. The electronic sounds in it are interesting but sound messy and, well, just don't groove with me. \\"The Bends\\", however, b1tch-slaps Telex and demands to be noticed with it's amazingly catchy hook, angst-filled but generally good-natured lyrics such as \\"I wish it was the 60's, I wish I could be happy, I wish, I wish that something would happen\\". Despite it's angst, however, this is by far the most rockin' song on the album, due primarily to the wicked guitar riffs and Thom's electric vocals -- \\"I wanna live, breath -- I wanna be a part of the Human race!\\", he wails... And it's convincing. And, heck, I don't know where I'm going with this review...<br />It's hard to say what I prefer more on \\"The Bends\\" -- the slower, melodramatic ballads (\\"High and Dry\\", \\"Flake Plastic Trees\\") or the upbeat ones (\\"Sulk\\", \\"The Bends\\") -- suffice to say they're both pretty great. It's nice to hear the acoustic guitar in pure form here (something you wouldn't be able to do in the coming years), and Thom seems to be digging deep from his soul in a majority of the songs, without being laden with electronics and distortions of various sorts. Actually, when I ponder on the question, the slower bits are what makes \\"The Bends\\" what it is. \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" is the most wrenching, moving piece on the album (and arguably the best), and it, \\"Street Spirit\\", and \\"High and Dry\\" are the signature moments on the album that make it what it is. \\"Bulletproof, I wish I was...\\" is also a very grief-filled, emotionally gutted piece that I find very honest and really quite beautiful, and seems to be pretty underrated as far as the songs on the album go.<br />The thing is, \\"The Bends\\" ISN'T \\"OK Computer\\", and it lacks the magic that OK Comp brought with it. It doesn't have quite the coherence, the imagination, the beauty... It's clearly the workings of Human beings, not the Aliens that eventually became Radiohead.
B000022TSW|5.0|A movie containing lots of profanity about the reaction to a movie containing lots of profanity, &quot;South Park: Bigger Longer, and Uncut&quot; is also on the short list of THE funniest movies ever made.  This movie manages to remain hilarious even after repeated viewings (I'm at about eleven and counting) by taking everything that makes the TV show such a romp and carrying it to even greater levels of excess.  About five minutes in, when Terrence and Phillip break into a seemingly impromptu song and dance number whose name I can't repeat, it's obvious how much fun Trey Parker and Matt Stone had letting loose with everything they couldn't put on TV.  Blatantly calculated to please the show's fans and appall its detractors, &quot;Bigger, Longer and Uncut&quot; celebrates political incorrectness at every turn.  Pushing the show's penchant for subversion to new heights, the movie simultaneously manages to turn profanity into a plot device and an art form.  The first half of the movie is especially devastating, with the walking id known as Cartman unleashed in all his greedy, racist, foul-mouthed glory before his wrath is short-circuited by a V-chip.  The onslaught of naughty language and gross-outs could become numbing in a less intelligent movie, but fortunately the satirical edge that has always characterized &quot;South Park&quot; is completely intact.  Human nature in general and American culture in particular are given a massive sendup, with special attention devoted to the insufferable moralizing of hypocritical censorhip advocates that's best exemplified by Mrs. Broflofski's immortal line, &quot;horrific, deplorable violence is okay, as long as no one uses any naughty words!&quot;  And even when it's not slicing and dicing some aspect of modern life, the movie comes up with enough zany, inspired details to evoke continuous laughter in all but the most uptight viewers.  A must-see if there ever was one.
B000021YQV|4.0|Edgy, driving music, I say. This is my first (and as of now, only) SOAD experience, and I must say it gets me going each time I listen to it. I'm not exactly sure what &quot;nu-metal&quot; means (Linkin Park and SOAD being the only two bands that I know of who classify as such), but if Toxicity exemplifies the nu-metal sound, I'll certainly be looking for more of it in the future.<br />Basically, it's extremely well-produced (hardcore metal fines might even say it's a bit too finely tuned), melodic, yet hard and serious music that is both musically and lyrically well-made; a treat for the Spirit and for the mind. The hooks seize your brain and don't let go; the lyrics are mentally stimulating and quite often pretty schizophrenic; and the guitars are performed gloriously while unique textures are dispersed throughout the tracks to give the album a rejuvenating flavor. I often overuse the word &quot;energy&quot; in describing music, but it's so obvious when an album has a certain positive energy to it, and Toxicity does indeed. Once the album starts its heavy momentum doesn't stop until the album has concluded. <br />The first four songs are primarily guitar and rhythm driven, and probably the hardest, most blunt tracks on the album. I don't really care for the &quot;drug/prison facts&quot; thrown into &quot;Prison Song&quot;, but the song's sheer force makes up for this. Likewise, &quot;Needles&quot; and &quot;Dance&quot; are agressive, angst-filled anthems that boil the blood. Ah, then there's &quot;Jet Pilot&quot;... &quot;Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot, <BR>One that smiled when he flew over the bay&quot;... Great imagery, very intense song. Track 5, &quot;X&quot;, is probably my least favorite on the album -- hard and fast, but lyrically a bit too generic for my liking.<br />It's ridiculous that I attempt here to describe each song, and I certainly don't intend to when I begin this, but Toxicity is one of those albums that makes such comments inevitable. I mean, I just described the first 5 tracks on the album, and they're probably my 5 least favorite songs; let that tell you something! &quot;Chop Suey&quot; is, needless to say, the most popular of the bunch, and despite it being SEVERELY overplayed over the course of time, the song, quite literally, sounds as amazing as ever -- without question one of the best songs of that year. It's so beautifully distinct and wildly original, with great harmonics and fantastic lyrics... Just to die for. Other favorites include &quot;Forrest&quot;, &quot;Atwa&quot;, &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Toxicity&quot;, and &quot;Aerials&quot;... Yeah, everything but two tracks, and even those kick ass. Again, I must mention the lyrics, &quot;Forrest&quot; and &quot;Science&quot; in particular, which I find intelligent and (in the former) very schizophrenic, but in a profound, attractive manner. &quot;Toxicity&quot; and &quot;Science&quot; observe and angrily criticize our modern culture and its employed techniques while &quot;Aerials&quot;, with its epic guitar riffs, plunges deep into Taoistic philosophies that, again, are very attractive to the mind.<br />All in all, Hell, get the freaking thing. The only people I can see not liking it are those who simply don't like hard-edged music. Note, however, that I absolutely get into each and every moment of it, while I find a band like Slipknot too much for me. So, as music fan that isn't particularly into heavy metal, Toxicity still burns a flame inside me. <br />P.S. I must say, it's great to hear an album that doesn't feel the need to be overlong and pretentious. At 45 minutes, it gets the job done perfectly without wasting space or time... Well done.

B000002UAF|5.0|This is a fantastic Beatles CD that captures the excitement of the group before they slipped into the boring over-produced releases of Rubber Soul and Revolver, and the over hyped Sgt. Pepper.<br />5 Stars!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I haven't heard a new artist come forth with incredible music in many years up until I got a chance to listen to Groban's second album entitled \\"Closer\\" and what I have to say is is that WOW! I had lost much of my faith in newer younger artists who have been breaking onto the music scene. Around 99 percent of them just sell themselves to being poseur rappers (yergh) or generic commercial pop, rock bands with little to no uniqueness in their styles. The result is just bland, forgettable and sometimes just awful music in my part. Josh Groban though blows all of his peers right out of the water and into the trash with his second album \\"Closer\\" and I can't believe that I'm saying this but he is already rising into becoming a favorite of mines for the year 2003 and 2004 and with \\"Closer\\" I could very well consider myself a fan of his. He brings forth among the greatest singing skills that I haven't heard by many artists in many years and to back that up, he selects the perfect styles of music to go along with it: Opera, pop, with some classical spice thrown in and the result is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time, possibly in years. A lot of this album benefits from David Foster's production whose production is among my favorites of modern music producers. Go and check out his 1986 self-titled and \\"River Of Love\\" album as they are both incredible. What's even better is that Josh in fact wrote and composed some of the songs on this album!<br /> This album opens with a stunning snowstorm of beauty with the bittersweet \\"Oceano\\" and ends with a stormy bang with the ethnic \\"Never Let Go\\". \\"Oceano\\" starts as a tender ballad with haunting opera vocals and tender piano and then rises into a dramatic power pop ballad with a classical pop sound to it. This album also has songs in four languages: French, Spanish, Italian and English but even with the confusion in translating, the songs are all amazing like as if you could still understand them and break down the language barriers. In between the first and final songs are songs of just sheer beauty with songs like \\"My Confession\\", \\"Caruso\\", and \\"Remember When It Rained\\". \\"Caruso\\" is a really exotic song sung in Italian and having a rather colorful Spanish or Italian acoustic classical sound. This reminds me a lot of Andrea Bocelli, another favorite of mines.<br />The final track \\"Never Let Go\\" is a stunning closer with dark and haunting ambient pop textures and featuring an amazing collaboration between him and the New Age/ World pop group Deep Forest. The mixture of Deep Forest's atmospherics and haunting ethnic background chants combined with Josh Groban's unbelievably gorgeous opera singing skills is phenomenal. I especially love hearing the song go from a dark minor note song into an uplifting major note song. Just incredible! I felt almost like as if I were flying through rain storms during the minor note parts and in clear sunny skies during the major note parts when listening to this incredible song.  I love the other songs on this album but the ones I mentioned are what deserved the greatest attention.<br />I am definitely looking forward to Groban's next album in the foreseeable future. I'm not sure what the future may hold for Groban but where things stand right now, with the numerous poseur artists ruining music, Josh Groban fills a HUGE void in pop music by making music that is deep, artistically creative, dark, and powerful. If the same people who bought a lot of the plastic poseur material like \\"In The Zone\\" and 50 Cent also bought Josh Groban's \\"Closer\\", then my faith in America's taste for music would have a huge boost. Not since Seal burst into the light with his debut album more than 12 years before then has a new artist brought forth such great music at such an early part of his/her career.<br /> I strongly urge just about every music lover to go and get their hands on a copy of this AMAZING album! I even urge younger people to get their hands on this to see that there are younger artists that are defying the awful MTV trends and putting out great music. Josh Groban is a breath of fresh air these days in the music scene.<br /> This album definitely \\"Raised Me Up\\" and continues to do and and will \\"Never Let Go\\" of it ever! There is so much more that this album offer than I could ever dream of mustering with this review. Enough said, just go and buy this album. End of review.that there are younger artists that are defying the awful MTV trends and putting out great music.

B000002UDB|2.0|Released in between Sgt. Pepper (summer 1967) and &quot;The Beatles&quot; (1968), this CD offers 4 songs that fall into the category of memorable Beatle classics - Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, Hello Goodbye, and All You Need is Love.  The rest are songs that were used to create an EP in addition to these popular singles.  An alternative approach would have been to include these songs on Sgt. Pepper in place of Within You Without You or She's Leaving Home, which would have made Pepper a bit of a better album. Not a &quot;must have&quot; for Beatle fans, but OK.
0385504209|4.0|With all the hype about this book, I was looking forward to reading it, however, I got ahold of Brown's Angels and Demons first and read that first.  The Da Vinci Code was very good, but I was a bit disappointed that it seemed to follow a formula that I had seen almost exactly in Angels and Demons with regard to the characters and plot development.<br />Despite the formulaic style of the writing that annoyed me somewhat, the book was still very good.  As in Angels and Demons, I don't know how much of the information regarding the subject matter is accurate, but it worked well for the purposes of the story, and I think that's most important in fiction.  Brown does a good job of withholding and revealing information at the right times so you are always wanting to know more, but you find out enough to not get frustrated.<br />If you've read Angels and Demons, you may find this a little too similar, but it's still good.  If you haven't read Angels and Demons, than this will be much better.  I will probably read more of Brown's books, but likely not anything with Robert Langdon in it.
6304806442|4.0|Great movie. The only downside in it and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the strong thick acient. It was hard to understand some of the dialouge but other than that the movie was a great! I have not read the book yet but from the reviews that I read the book is much better so I will read that. I found this movie to be very dark though it really goes inside the mind of a junkie. It's really scary! Great acting as well. Oh, and for those of those reviewers that didnt like the movie because some of the actors were ugly...who cares that does not matter! And for the dead baby thats the only part I didnt understand how did the baby die, did it get ahold of some drugs or did it starve? Can someone please e-mail me and tell me what happened. But it was a great move over all!
B000089RVR|5.0|If you liked the songs from Dido's first album &quot;No Angel&quot;, you should hear the songs from her new album, &quot;Life For Rent&quot;.  My favorites are &quot;White Flag&quot;, &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot;, and &quot;See the Sun&quot;.
6302968100|5.0|One of the best movies that Tarintino has ever written! It's just too bad that he didnt direct it it would have been much better I bet. This was a very fun film to watch. And its great too because if you have a date you might think of renting True Romance because its about love and all. This movie had great little sub-plots. And an awsome all start cast. Tarintino is a genius!
6304068441|5.0|if you really and truly understand this film and get in depth and touch with it, its a real drama people...based upon a true story of a nun who visits a deathrow inmate and sees the real him. filled with performances that will make you cry...I certainly cryed at the end when Sean Penn's character died...and I'm saying this becuase I hardly even cry during movies...its just one of those movies that really gets in you after the final frame I guess....one fo 1995's best. Sean Penn should of one an oscar or something...come on people
B00003BDXG|4.0|Tarintino is a genius he helped write this movie and it was great! I loved all the black and white parts that is just great great film making! I love how you are able to look inside the cerial killers mind and see why he is that way. Great story telling and belive it or not I thought it was kinda funny at some parts. It also had a great cast and great acting. Man Lewis is so hot! Reason for the 4 stars I thought was that crazy ending I really didnt like how they got away with everything and even still live a happy life with children and all. Thats just not real. But Tarintio is a natural born writer!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I have the collectors edition XMen and X2. They are great, but what was really shocking was that Jean Grey died. It was really sad. Great movie, otherwise. Definitely buy it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The DVD set is great but came with Spanish subtitles.  Now the set has to be returned and exchanged for English subtitles.

0446608955|5.0|Like everything Sparks writes, &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; overflows with easy yet beautiful prose.  He writes with a sensitivity that seems beyond human and taps into human emotion without being overly sentimental.  He pushes and tags in the right places, never over-doing it.  If you're looking for an enjoyable but mature read about teenage love, loss and growth, I highly recommend this novel.  I saw the movie first and loved it.  In my opinion, the movie is equally as good and heartwrenching as the novel.  Enjoy both!  You won't regret it!
B00006D295|3.0|I rated this movie 3 stars because it really depends upon when and where you see it.  <br />If you have never seen it, and decide to watch the DVD in the privacy of your own home - I can almost guarantee you to hate it, hence the reason why many have given it a 1-star rating. It is a total B-Movie, and failed in 7 of the 8 theaters it premiered. <br />HOWEVER if you open your mind to some good fun, find out where the midnight movies play in your neighborhood and check out the RHPS as it is meant...  You are guaranteed a good time and would rate this movie 5 STARS!!<br />I really don't know how to explain it any clearer.  It is a combination of film, live theater, audience participation and dancing in the aisles all in one!  You can't get ANY of this from the DVD, and you wouldn't understand it from the DVD if you didn't see it in the theater.  No need to be so intimidated when you see everyone dressed as his or her favorite character - I've never attended dressed up.  Remember this movie has been popular for 30 years... I saw it with my uncle, and can't wait to take my own kids when they are old enough (rated R).<br />As for the stars, yes there is Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, MeatLoaf, and Charles Gray.  Yes they were all relatively unknown at the time this was released, and yes many of them have tried to distance themselves from the project since its release.  You would too... unless you fell under the spell of this cult-classic!<br />Enjoy!  <br />NOW... <br />Let there be LIPS!
B000053VAF|5.0|Just like Mallrats, the cover kicks ass!!! The special features in this dvd isn't too shaby either. Theres not really much of a featurette, but it includes over an hour of deleted scenes. This movie makes you think. The best scenes are between Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. I can't believe I mentioned Ben Affleck and a \\"good scene\\" together in the same sentance. The only films he's ever good in are Kevin Smith movies. Jay and Silent Bob are funny in this too. The weird thing about this movie is knowing what to classify it under. Comedy? Drama? Action? You need to see this movie!!!!!and buy it.....
B0000C7PQK|4.0|I was pleased to see a new release from Enigma, this one is just what I expected from them. The balance of the CD and how it flows from beginning to end is like the tide. This CD like the others takes you from a calming beginning to a peak of music sensuality to the relaxing end. I have never been disapointed by this music and its artist.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Its a strong release, but maybe Badu is still takin time building up to her sophmore release.  Worldwide Underground has nice tracks that would have done well at 6 min instead of 9 minutes.  On Bump It, Back in the day, and I want you my three favorite songs in addition to Danger all have 2-3 min at the end of her just wailing and weird vocal sounds.  But its Badu wat can u expect.  Woo is nuthin but a jam session, but The Grind is an intense and short ode to the hustlin'. I Love DANGER! When I first heard it I was blown away.  It's been a while since I heard anything that damn funky.  But Erykah where's the video.  I enjoy the remix , but I wish the original of Love of My Life was on here 2.  I love Angie Stone and Queen Latifah on there.  I like the release, but I still jam Mama's Gun.  Her masterpiece.
B00006ADFL|1.0|If you manage to heroically yawn your way through the first, mmm, one hour of this film, and if you manage to dissillusion yourself into caring about any of the characters you see, you might actually not consider watching this a complete waste of time. But you'd still be painfully close to it..<br />    Peter Jackson does some gracious wasting of celluloid by showing us ethereal dancing scenes that contribute zilch to the plot. Whenever he runs out of choreography he throws in some hallucinatory visuals hoping this will distract ya from asking \\"hey, dude, where's my movie?\\", but, nonetheless \\"Heavenly creatures\\" remains a draggy affair with only one huge positive: it only lasts a merciful one and a half hour..<br />    Now, this is not to say that the story actually implied in this film is not good. I'm sure that in real life (this is based on a true story) these two female characters were indeed tremendously interesting and brave for defying the \\"morals\\" of the tragically puritan society they lived in. And I'm positive in thinking that their homosexual affair did stir the murky waters of their ultra-conservative environs. I'm also quite sure that their story, their real life story, was definately worth narrating and even filming.<br />    However, we'll have to wait patiently on, until someone else, with less tendencies for the pointlessly absurd and abstract, refilms this. Because what Lord of the Yawns-director has done here was not worth the sleep i fought not falling into..<BR>   Unless you're a total beginner in the  sport of film-viewing, i advise ya to try something else. If however, you tend to be easily impressed, then this might do it for ya.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD is awesome.  Josh Groban is so talented and his second CD is the best CD I have gotten in 2003.  This CD is filled with classical music with a beat and he sings in four different languges.  Five stars all the way!
0786915749|4.0|This book and the whole Chronicles trilogy was my first introduction to fantasy.  I remember reading these babies back when I was in elementary school.  I must admit that when I came back and read them they weren't quite as good as I remember but I suppose that was inevitable.  Fantasy now seems to be more sophisticated, more mature like Kushiel's Dart and other titles.  Still, there is a place for simple fantasy.  After all, if I want to read stories with people banging I'll pick up a romance novel.  On the other hand if I I am in the mood for fantasy then this story and other like it fill the void nicely.  Cutting to the chase I would have to say that this is a definite grab for fans of old school fantasy but those of you with a taste for more adult reading will likely want to try George R.R. Martin's Game of thrones with it's fleshed out charcters, intricate storylines(and much, ahem, banging).<br />P.S. Raistlin is one of the coolest charaters of all time.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|First of all, I can see how this movie is very debatable.  The special effects, action, and actors were stellar, but yes, it was lacking in substance.  The storyline was good, but all of this could have been expanded.  Even though there should have been more romance between Selene and Michael, the action made up for it.  It's better anyway because vampires are not supposed to be overly romantic; they specialize in killing and violence, which make the vampire genre horrific, but extremely interesting. <br />Now for the pros.  The movie's setting was dynamic; I think that really helped catch the viewer's attention.  I loved the Gothic, dark effect because it suitably characterizes vampires.  The action was amazing, even though we've seen forms of it in The Matrix.  While a lot of movies are remotely interesting and lack spunk, Underworld held my attention.  It's one of those movies where you're glued to the screen; there's no time for yawning or wandering thoughts.  Only movies like The Matrix and Minority Report (another awesome movie) have had this effect on me.  The feud between vampires and lycans is also a great concept.    <br />Even though I do wish that it could have been longer by showing more of the vampiric culture and romance between the two leads, Underworld definitely exceeded my expectations.  It's a great vampire film - one of the best out there in my opinion.  Being a vampire genre fan, I enjoyed it immensely.  If you're reading reviews on the movie that are commentary/opinion, all I can say is disregard them.  Watch the movie yourself and find out.
0375432302|2.0|I'm not a religious person, but I must say most of the factoids presented in the book have nothing at all to do with proving the main point of the book and the supposedly relevant \\"factoids\\" are far more \\"toid\\" than \\"fact\\". Consider this:<br />If you believe that's Mary Magdalene in the cleaned version of Last Supper instead of John, take a look at James the Less and Jesus in there too, and then take a look at the Da Vinci painting called \\"St. John the Baptist\\". They all look feminine, and alot of Da Vinci's females look potentially male. Old news. The book claims a romantic relationship between Jesus and the person to his right in the Last Supper, and points out that Da Vinci was homosexual, so alot of the facts in this book could be equally slanted to claim Jesus was gay rather than having a wife. Or perhaps the supposed coverup was meant to supress the fact that Jesus and Mary were celebrated Hebrews ...the Priory of Zion/Sion? But even if it was Mary Magdalene in the Last Supper, this proves what? Also, Mona Lisa was the wife of Francesco del Gicondo, not a picture of Da Vinci himself as the book claims. Brown seems to be saying \\"if I come up with one actual provable fact about anything, no matter how un-related to the actual point, it means everything else I put in here is true too\\".<br />I adore and respect women, but I still didn't appreciate the catch-phrase \\"sacred feminine\\" being used over and over as a smoke-screen. The pornography industry is rampant here secretly backed by corporations, is this a clandestine celebration of the \\"sacred feminine\\" too? Or logic like \\"I made a left-turn down this street, left is the symbol for the sacred feminine, Mary must be guiding me\\". Please.<br />The spy/action/mystery plot of this novel is weak and I nearly gave up on it halfway through, including glaring plot holes, and making the police look like slapstick comedy. They outrun police cruisers in a tiny 100-kilometer-per-litre economy car, and despite a national televised manhunt they never even attempt to disguise themselves while roaming around constantly getting recognized. It might have been a fun/interesting read if the erroneous \\"facts\\" had not been so repeatedly force-fed on the reader over and over ad nauseam like that would somehow make them more valid.<br />A goodly amount of craftsmanship, thought, effort, education, and research went into this book and I see why alot of people enjoyed it, especially women and people who don't like the church, but it is far and away a marketing campaign, and that ruined the read for me as much as anything.levised manhunt they never even attempt to disguise themselves while roaming around constantly getting recognized.

B00005JMTQ|5.0|Jack Nicholson has won many awards but this is the best thing he has ever done.  From Schmidtt to Somethings Gotta Give he is more vulnerable and emotional as an actor then he has ever been which for better or worse corresponds to those of us who have reached our 50's and 60's.  Diane Keaton must have been cloned.  Her body seems to look the same as in Annie Hall. Few movies anymore leave the audience clapping at the end, but this one did.  And how many people almost wet their pants when Diane Keaton handed Jack Nicholson the sissors!!  I'm going again this weekend.
B00005AQF7|1.0|What can I say, this is aural pornography.  I'll tell you, as a proud woman, I can't stomach this type of thing, with the B-word thrown around so freely.  I know Mr. Dogg has been in the business for many years, and he has earned his success the hard way.  That doesn't mean we independent ladies (unite!) need to like it.  Gin and juice?  I gots no use!  Pass the lysol, this cd stinks up the room.
0385512104|5.0|This is a story whose narrator is Christopher Boone, a fifteen year old autistic boy who lives in Swindon, England and attends a school for &quot;special needs&quot; children. Christopher begins the narration by describing his discovery of the dead body of the recently killed poodle, Wellington, who belonged to his friend Mrs. Shears. After a misunderstanding and minor altercation with a policeman (due to Christopher's autism), he decides to solve the mystery of Wellington's murder and his detective investigation is to form the basis of the book which he has decided to write. (He has read several Sherlock Holmes mysteries and thus is familiar with the methods employed by detectives.)  <br />The early chapters are cleverly written so that Christopher introduces us to himself, his family and neighbors, his school and favorite teacher Siobhan, and the nature of autism. We learn how Christopher's mind works, and while in other circumstanes several of the chapters might seem like digressions, this presentation is such that in fact they provide the basis for the remainder of the book. As Christopher discusses why he cannot lie, lists his behavioral problems, and compares his mind to a DVD recorder, the reader is  provided a wonderful understanding of the life of an autistic boy (and the difficulties for those who come into contact with him). And Christopher's encyclopedic knowlege is interesting in it's own right; e.g., I certainly never understood how our brains porocessed visual information during the eye flicks called saccades. I recognize, of course, that one of the reasons why I was so entranced by this book is that Christopher's interests mirror many of my own, e.g., math, logic, Star Trek, etc. As an SF fan, I was delighted to be reminded of the Daleks in the pathbreaking BBC series DOCTOR WHO.<br />But be forewarned, we as readers have been subject to some misdirection and the nature of the story abruptly changes approximately midway through Christopher's narration. (I cannot go into details without in effect introducing a spoiler into this review.) The story is no longer simply about Christopher's life with his father in Swindon and the search for Wellington's killer, but instead about events that will change Christopher's life forever. His plans to become the first student from his school to sit for A-level maths and apply to University will be disrupted, and he will have to adapt to situations in which his autism is very disrutive and counterproductive. While this half of the book was extremely effective in providing many insights regarding how autistic individuals react to stress, I found myself much less enthralled by the narration and much more caught up in concern for Christopher and his well-being (as the author no doubt intended).<br />So, in summary, I highly recommend this novel and believe that reading a story from the perspective of an autistic person will undoubtedly be a unique and rewarding experience for most individuals. And before you proceed too far into the story you will discover why it begins with chapter 2 and ends with chapter 233 but has only fifty-one chapters. (My recommendation is despite the fact that the ending seemed a little too contrived and feel good, which in most circumstances would have caused me to round down my rating).<br />READER ALERT: There is one error in this book which I would like to highlight. When Christopher discusses a math/logic problem which he labels THE MONTY HALL PROBLEM, he uses it to illustrate how complicated numbers are and why he likes them. But in this case the problem was so complicated that both Christopher and the noted Marilyn vos Savant (who he references) arrive at the wrong answer. (I will blame the author for this error, since he is not a mathematician.) The solution can be addressed in three different ways: first, by utilizing conditional probabilty theory, second,by calculating the joint probabilties of the events, or, third, by a logic diagram, but thetwo solutions provided in the book are both flawed because they treat the sequence of events as independent when they are not. Thus, the intuitive answer which Christopher rejects is in fact correct. However, while this temporarily distracted me from the story it did not detract from my enjoyment of the book; and it was the only factual error which I discovered in the areas of Christopher' s knowledge with which I was conversant.<br />Tucker Andersen
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent is one have the best rappers we have right now. He may have a slur but only becuase he got shot which only makes him more realthan rapper such as Eminem, Ja Rule. He has been compared to Tupac which in my opinion is a huge honor. 50 Cent Explodes on the scene with In The Club. The song made 50 popular in the clubs, then he came out with 21 Questions Feat. nate Dogg which is also a great club song. Then he Comes out with P.I.M.P. All of these songs show his great rapping capability. He has a great flo in his songs. He raps aboat his real life in songs like Many men. This CD is a great Debuet album, I give this CD four stars becuase of Great Beats, Lyrics, Flo. Peace aight!
038572179X|4.0|Many reviewers seem to have found the novel to be plodding and contrived, but for me, it was a beautiful, compelling read.  I didn't find part I to be slow at all.  I was hooked from the start.  The only part where my attention wandered somewhat was during part II, with all the war descriptions.  But I see the purpose of that whole section, now that I've finished the novel.<br />The last two pages were heartbreaking.
B000060P79|1.0|Often in the music business, bands or musicians form for no apparent reason, they are pointless, unoriginal, unexceptional, and they certainly DO NOT further music at all. Clay Aiken is one of these musicians, Avril Lavigne is one of these musicians, and Simple Plan is DEFINATELY one of these bands.<br />I listen to the music, I watch the videos, and I sit there thinking &quot;why?&quot; why on earth does this band exist? what makes these people think they can sing or play instruments???? the lead singer's voice is ATROCIOUS. There is NOTHING special or original about him or his bandmates. These guys are not punk, they are jockstraps with instruments.   <br />Songwriting is also quite redundant. These fools do not tell me anything that I do not already know. Therefore, I see NO point in listening to them. I do hope you see them in the same way. Let us hope someone socks the lead singer jockstrap in his pretty face (the only reason girls like the band in the first place) and thus the band will serve no purpose anymore, and break up. We don't need them. Music needs originality. Listen to AFI.
0385504209|4.0|I heard all the hype and thought The Da Vinci Code couldn't possibly be as good as I'd heard. However, it really is...especially for someone not well versed in studies concerning the Holy Grail. I found the parts describing the Grail &amp; all the research that has been done on it fascinating. It really made me want to read more about the topics of the Grail &amp; Mary Magdelene, and it is becoming rare for me to find a book that interests me that much.<br />The Da Vinci Code has two elements that make it great: not only is it a page turning thriller, but it really makes you think. The research Brown must have done (even if he uses all research that is not necessarily his own) had to have taken ages. He really brings a topic that is not widely known to the public eye.<br />I gave the book 4 stars for only one reason. It IS a thriller and starts to employ some cliched ideas toward the end of the novel--after all the information (besides the location of the Grail) is revealed, and Sophie &amp; Langdon are racing around trying to recover the cryptex, etc.<br />The book is still wonderful, and I highly reccomend it.
0930289528|4.0|I'll try not to say anything about this that hasn't been said before but that's unlikely, considering that this is Alan Moore.<br />Make no mistake about it. This is not Watchmen. What we have here are ideas from books like 1984 and Animal Farm presented in comic book form with a sort of batman-like hero at the helm. It succeeds by creating a uniquely British atmosphere with beautifully illustrated scenes in washed out, dystopian colors. There are many characters speaking in rather thick British accents, and probably dozens of English landmarks or locations that I don't recognize. <br />Interestingly, it also took out the comic book sound fx and narrative. Everything is done in dialogue. What's kind of tedious though, is that V talks like a fortune cookie, quoting this book or that. He comes across as a man of only a few words of his own, with the rest of the characters reciting his story.<br />If this was a movie, I'd reccomend rental instead of buying. Try it at your local library first.
B00004VXF2|1.0|It's a pretty good joke and statement, not much in the way of an album though. Delievers what it promises though, a ton of feedback. My main problem with this is that people like to compare it to actual metal music, which is wholly ridiculous.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I loved Songs in A minor so when I heard the diary was coming out obviously I rushed to the shops to buy it.It sometimes happens that the second album of some one as hyped up as Alicia is not nearly as good as her first album. That did not happen with the diary. In two years Alicia has really grown as a singer and song writer, and where Songs in A minor has more of a hip RNB feel, the diary is alot more mellow and soulful. I think that the diary comes straight from the heart and combined wth her true lyrics, her silky smooth voice really makes The diary the best Soul album of 2003. It may take time, but if you really listen to this album you will find its depth and will not regret buying it. Will she be trhe new Aretha? Only time will tell.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Not sure what album most of the other viewers have been listening to but I think this is a pretty classy album ( and yes, I'm over 40 !! ). You can give me this over Madonna and Pink any time. <br />If you're unsure, then try to listen to it first before buying. You won't be disappointed though. <br />Keep it up Britney !
B00006CXXU|5.0|What can I say? This cd spoke to me in so many ways. So touching and so deep! I don't agree with some of the things Christina does-but hey, it's her life! In that way, she is such an inspiration to me. Unlike her rival, she is real!!!- and her music is a beautiful example of this. Her amazing voice just echoes in my head after listening to this cd. It helped me through a very bad time- and in dealing with extreme depression. Her cd was a very comforting friend at this time. Definitely buy this- Oh, and lest I forget, this cd rocks!!!!
B00005JMCT|5.0|this has the bachlor party I jacked off so much to the nude women
B000002UAX|5.0|The reason why this album is my favorite?  The raw sound, the amazing variety of music, and it's the Beatles!  Some people such as producer George Martin think it should have been cut down to form a &quot;flawless&quot; single album.  I completely disagree.  The reason why the album is so breathtaking is BECAUSE it's not flawless!!!  There's so much magic here that is not on any other Beatles album.  If you don't own the white album, get it.  It's absolutely wonderful, in my opinion the best one the Beatles ever made.
B00005JMGC|5.0|MONA LISA SMILE may seem from the trailer like a piece of light (and silly) fluff, another chance for the indomitable Julia Roberts to perform in a splendid setting. Well, the last phrase is true: Roberts does have a magnificently beautiful setting (Wellesley College and its environs) but she does more than 'perform'. This is one of her more understated, underplayed, and sensitive pieces of work to date. Playing a wide-eyed California feminist teacher of Art History, she moves into the Wellesley faculty and 'Stepford Wives Preps' student body where marriage and service to the Ultimate Goal Husband overrides all other aspects of 'higher education', and slowly and painfully makes her vision seep into the minds of these very non-liberated women of tomorrow. Her pupils are well acted by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Kirsten Dunst, Gennifer Goodwin (a stunning newcomer to this reviewer), and Julia Stiles. She observes the effects of the old Wellesley attitude in the various reactions by Marcia Gay Harden (in another jewel of a portrayal), Juliet Stevenson, Marian Seldis and Donna Mitchell. The only prominent male in this cast is Dominic West who holds his own and creates a powerful chemistry with Roberts (et al...). Mike Newell knows this 1950s state of brainwashed girls who buy into the formidable philosophy that a woman's place is in the home by the iron, dishes, stove, ad infinitum. This is a terrifying reminder of how many women fostered their own degradation in the march toward future Women's Rights. To Newell's credit he does not opt for a Hollywood happy-wappy ending, but instead elects to just allow the influence of Roberts' character be felt in the fadeout. For once a magnificent set of credits visuals (with Barbra Streisand's inimitable rendering of \\"Smile\\" as the music) documents the history that lies behind this delicate story. Bravo to the people who elected to do this service. This film is a warm, sensitive, serious movie that deals with many issues we need desperately to heed less they affect other 'minority' groups. Excellent!y to heed less they affect other 'minority' groups. Excellent!
B00000J7JO|5.0|I lovethis CD. the instant I popped this into my CD player, I knew I had a winner. This is much softer than their previous works (Blood Sugar Sex Magik, One Hot Minute) but the new style works. There are reasons that this album got multiple grammy nominations. This CD has so many singles it is ridiculous.<br />Favorite Songs<br />All Around the World- Reminiscent of their older work, this song is great. An awesome base line and fun lyrics- I love this song.<br />Scar Tissue- I really like this song. One of their softer songs, it has infectious lyrics and good guitar. Great.<br />Californication- My personal favorite. The lyrics are great ( It's understood that hollywood sells californication..) The guitar line is excellent, very catchy. A slower song. Excellent.<br />Emut Remmus- One of the  quicker, lighter song. Has a very beach-y feel to it. Cool Lyrics and good guitar<br />Road Trippin' - A good end to the CD. Just the right pace. Really sounds like the title. Good Job.<br />Overall this CD is my favorite Peppers' Album. Hardcore Chili fans might dispute this opinion because of the CD's soft nature, but whatever. If you are new to the Peppers Funk- Rock style buy this album. You will not be disapointed. A masterpiece.
B00008PW2D|1.0|I love the series but I will do without these 8 episodes. I refuse to pay the same amount for 8 episodes that I pay for a full season. NO WAY!
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero was Kurt Cobain's response to the fanfare Nirvana recieved from the CD Nevermind. Angry and pissed at all the attention his little band was getting, Cobain determined to make In Utero sound much rawer. Boy did he ever do that. The CD sounds much darker, rawer and louder than Nevermind. Free from the studio polish and clean sound that Kurt thought 'ruined' Nevermind, this CD is full of distortion, anguish, and pain.<br />This CD has some classic tracks on it- Pennyroyal Tea, Heart Shaped Box, Rape Me, and many others. However, Very Ape and Milk It really hurt the album's flow andare really bad songs. Honestly, it would have been better if they had just been left off.<br />But these are just two minor blemishes. The CD is wonderful and a classic. The lyrics are heart spoken and true and the music is raw like rock should be. A truly great album that shows Nirvana at the top of their form. And for only eleven bucks its a steal.
B00005J6T0|4.0|MADONNA - TRUE BLUE<br />PAPA DON'T PREACH: is an absolute classic but the more that I listen to it I realize that there could have been so much more done musically with this song. Nonetheless it is brilliant. I give this a 4/5.<BR>OPEN YOUR HEART: is perhaps one of Madonna's most perfectly crafted pop songs that she released during the eighties. Sheer perfection. 5/5<BR>WHITE HEAT: has such a catchy riff to it and though i'm not completely sure of the theme, it offers up enough to bring the listener right into Madonna's little tale. 3/5<BR>LIVE TO TELL: is the perfect ballad for Madonna. It's almost what makes this record. And boy did she ever live to tell. 5/5<BR>WHERE'S THE PARTY: I find that this song is way to bubblegum for Madonna. While it is a fun, ambitious and upbeat song, I would just expect more from Madonna. 3/5<BR>TRUE BLUE: This title track has the same bubblegum flavor as Where's The Party but in this case it actually works! Her voice is angelic on this track and she doesn't over do it. 4/5<BR>LA ISLA BONITA: Madonna the true pioneer. Before latin pop was all the rage we of course had Madonna giving it a try in that late eighties. Not only did she give it a try she succeeded better than those of latin origin that came about in the late nineties. 5/5<BR>JIMMY JIMMY: This is the one weak song on this record. I tried listening to this over and over and it just does nothing for me. 2/5<BR>LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND: While I enjoy this song I can't help but think it sounds like some vacation package jingle that tries to get us to believe we can really go to The Bahamas for 499.99. That aside, this song is a nice way to end off the record, upbeat with a positive message. 3/5<br />Overall this is of course an impressive offering from Madonna. But does she ever really disappoint?
B00006RU5B|5.0|Let's get this out of the way first: I loved Rage Against the Machine. I was very disapointed when Zach de la Rocha left. Luckily Chris Cornell came along and low and behold Audioslave is born. Although their style is much differnt than RATM's, Audioslave is just as good in its own way. Great rock music.<BR>Here's A Rundown of my favorites.<br />Cochise- A straight out rocker with an awesome guitar part. <br />Show Me How To Live- Another Great Guitar part (Tom Morrelo is the best) along with some good lyrics.<br />Like a Stone- An incredible guitar solo and a good overall song. A bit slower than the previous 4 songs.<br />Set it off- For some reason, I just love this song. Maybe it's Cornell's catchy screech or the base. Good song.<br />Light My way- Beggining sounds very much like classic RATM (base line). I like the song- good beat and guitar work, with Cornell's vocals layered nicely over it.<br />All in all, this album is a great buy. If you hated Soundgarden or just hate Chris Cornell, you might not like Audioslave. But chances are, if you like either RATM or Soundgarden, you'll find something to like on this wonderful album. Whether it is straight out rocking or softly playing in the background, this album is great. I hope their next effort is just as good.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|BRITNEY SPEARS - IN THE ZONE<BR>1. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC(F. MADONNA): I believe that this is the perfect collaboration. The reigning female pop star today and her mentor, the reigning female pop star for the last two decades. This song is so catchy you can't help but sing along. 5/5<BR>2. (I GOT THAT)BOOM BOOM(F. YING YANG TWINS): This song might have been better had she not worked with The Ying Yang Twins. Their hollering makes the song unpleasant to listen to. Not to mention the ridiculous title of the song. The only parts of this song that are enjoyable are where Britney is singing solo, sans backup singers. Hopefully Britney doesn't work with these guys again! 2/5<BR>3. SHOWDOWN: While this song has a catchy beat it doesn't seem well structured. The vocals are not the strongest but it would make an excellent single for her in the future I think. 3/5<BR>4. BREATHE ON ME: I think this track is Excellent. I love it. If Britney releases this song as a single I can easily see her getting a Grammy nod for Best Dance Recording. This is the best song on the record in my opinion. The only thing wrong here is when she sings &quot;monogomy is the way to go&quot; which would be like Madonna singing that same line her song &quot;Erotica&quot;.5/5<BR>5. EARLY MORNING: This is a good party song....has enough appeal to the club fans and long time fans. 4/5<BR>6. TOXIC: This song has quite an annoying intro but it does surprisingly get better as it progresses. Awesome chorus. I've heard this will be the second release off this record. 4/5<BR>7. OUTRAGEOUS: Britney! Stay away from R. Kelly. This song is not &quot;outrageous&quot;. It is absolutely &quot;horrendous&quot; This is what I meant when I said &quot;when she's bad, she's really bad&quot;. This song has stupid lyrics, and I can honestly say I was tempted to fast forward through this song. Hopefully she's stay away from Mr. Kelly in the future for various reasons. 0/5<BR>8. TOUCH OF MY HAND: Finally something worth talkingabout on this record! Britney is telling some truth. Sort of I think. Does she really expect us to believe that she's just discovering the touch of her hand at age 22? That aside, this song has an awesome beat, sound and production. And has excellent vocals. It's good to hear Britney without her backup singers. 4/5<BR>9. THE HOOK UP: Bad, Bad, Bad, Really Bad! Since when is Britney a reggae artist? That's what she sounds like she's trying to be on this track. CRAP! 0/5<BR>10. SHADOW: Good vocals, excellent ballad, catchy, she should have done more of these types of songs. They really work for her. 4/5<BR>11. BRAVE NEW GIRL: Parts of this song actually remind me of Lucious Jacksons' &quot;Naked Eye&quot; I find this song takes us back to the sound found on her debut record. Good song. 4/5<BR>12. EVERYTIME: This song is was made for Britney. If she released more ballads I believe that she would do better. This song will be huge! That is if she releases it. It's absolutely spine tingling. Maybe because we the public know that it's truth. Maybe that's the key to Britney staying relevant. BE REAL. This song certainly is. 5/5<BR>13. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC(F. MADONNA)(RISHI RICH'S DESI KULCHA REMIX): The song starts off and you can hear that annoying citar that the remixers have throughout the entire song. Then you hear clips of Brit singing. Really though it sounds like she's belching. Past this intro though, it's a dancier version of the song and is really well remixed. Not as good as the original but no completely offensive. 4/5
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This is not one of Howard Shore's best pieces, but still stunning!!!! This soundtrack is very beautiful and emotional, with not as much war and evil music as one and two. Filled with soft, emotional, and flowing music, it is a very soothing soundtrack. The best feature about this soundtrack is the use of the actors singing talents. Featuring Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen, I was pleasently surprised to find that they have good voices!! I am very glad that Peter Jackson decided to have the actors and characters singing because that was a main feature of the book, the characters singing songs at pivotal moments of the story, and brought a humble quality to the trilogy. i thoroghly enjoyed this soundtrack.
B00003CWTI|2.0|Hmmm, a film about how the lives of a dozen characters living in Los Angeles interconnect with each other? Sounds similar to Robert Altman's \\"Short Cuts\\". But \\"Magnolia\\" stumbles around looking for a point. I was watching this film but I did not feel sympathy for most of the characters.     This film features a lot of good actors but the problem is they all seem to be overacting! The only performances worth watching are from John C. Reilly who plays a good-hearted cop who is looking for love and Phillip Seymour Hoffman who plays a nurse taking care of a dying cancer patient (Jason Robards). But I was left feeling like I wanted to throttle the cancer patient's wife (played by Julianne Moore, who is one of the best actresses working today) who is just a whiny, pill-popping psycho. And the cancer patient's' estranged son features a performance by Tom Cruise where he seems to be crying out \\"Please give me my Oscar!\\"    One of the most annoying things was that the soundtrack was obscuring the actual dialogue at times so it was hard to hear the actors. I was laughing out loud at one point when the characters started to sing along with one of the songs (a decent tune being sung by Aimee Mann). Another curiosity was the over use of tracking shots! Tracking shots can be effective  but not if you use them in every other scene!     I thought P.T. Anderson's earlier films \\"Hard Eight\\" and \\"Boogie nights were WAY better than this dreck. I will even give his latest film \\"Punch-Drunk Love\\" a viewing because he is a talented storyteller. But \\"Magnolia\\" will go down in my book as a pretentious, overly melodramatic mess of a movie.
0553212737|4.0|I will admit that when it comes to reading things that are regarding as &quot;classics&quot; I usually want to kill myself.  I find the language and story etc. boring.  Emma, is actually the exception to that.<br />Emma was written in the late 1800's by Austen who is known for her work Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice.  Emma is a young woman who prides herself on setting up her friend/governess with her new husband.  Emma decides to continue her matchmaking skills by taking on a new protege.  Her new protege has a crush on Mr. Martin whom Emma deems as not acceptable.  Emma tries to persuade Harriet's interest to others and well it is a fisaco.  The first man actually likes Emma.  The second man Harriet is interested in ends up being the man that Emma herself discovers she likes.  Of course all ends well with all the characters getting what they deserve.<br />It is an amusing read.  The theme seems to be that although Emma in the beginning seems like a shallow, selfish girl, in the end she realizes that she was snobby and wrong and tries to rectify her mistakes.  She doesn't want to hurt her friends and realizes that what she thought was best for them was wrong.<br />If you are looking for some &quot;quality fiction&quot;  or if you have a school report to write, this is an excellent book to read.  you won't be bored.
0780020685|5.0|I have not seen this movie, but The Last Samurai is now my most-favorite movie!  And, researching other Samurai books, poems, and other things, a lot of people referred to this movie!  I have never seen such large reviews on anything before I've come here!  And, the first one I read was the best!  I would also like to read what everyone else has to say about the movie, but reading the first review by JerrysOpine has said it all!  Not only a great review but a summary of the other ones!  Which, I would be maddened by reading!  I hate reviews for those &quot;Nitwits&quot; as another reviewer had said!  But, I love to see opinions like the ones on this first page!  And, this movie will be arriving at my house within the next month!  Then, I'll give an actual review!  And, I apologize for having not seen this movie yet!  But, I'm only 21 and am just starting to think and feel the compassion and love that movies like this bring forth!  Though I love LotfR, I have a great respect for the Samurai people and will start my search and research for what this world is greatly lacking today--honour...and respect!
0060555661|5.0|I had a recent hardcover edition from the library, but liked it enough I asked for the book for Xmas. I was glad I did, as the trade paperback edition I got for Xmas had the Zweig commentary after each chapter that my library version didn't. The commentary really helps clarify and update Graham's points (including much about the dot.commers dot.bombing). If you have the old edition with no Zweig commentary, I'd recommend getting the new edition. And if you have neither copy, get one! Buffet's afterword is priceless, too.
B000031WD9|1.0|i will give the movie credit for one good thing and that was the camera work. moving the camera through the hallway and the realism of the houses and rooms were a good touch.<BR>however i will give no credit to the story line<BR>this movie was a teen franchise<BR>it seems to be that nowadays in high school, teens think that if they dont lose their virginity before they take algebra they will be forever known as losers. or the fact that they act this stupid in high school while living with their parents,(for example going to 5 keg parties, performing oral sex in their bedrooms,..., broadcasting a sex scene on the internet, masturbating with a musical instrument), it scares me to think what teens will do when they go off to college. sad to say, i like films, but movies like american pie road trip so on are the ones that influence teens the most.<BR>Is sex really the only thing on teenagers minds today?<BR>boy our society should take a huge fall within the next 10 years<br />by then the population of high school parents should rise<BR>i know teens are anxious to grow up and be on their own, but come on!!! they dont need to be getting knocked up before their 15th birthdays!pie?)<br />Give me a coronary, Hollywood .  . make a film that doesn't portray teen virgins as prudes, self righteous  religious fanatics, or boring pimple faced losers - but as the TRUE  individuals not willing to go along with the crowd. I swear I don't know  how the makers of this film can justify making an R-Rated sex film directed  solely at teens (look at the magazines that pushed it, for example). . then  having the gaul to release an UNRATED version later (yes, Hollywood cares .  . look at all the ribbons on their lapels).  Give me a break, adults  weren't the market for this garbage, any more than &quot;Porky's&quot; was  for adults in the 1980's.
B000002ILG|5.0|Vito Bratta makes this album.  He has some of the tastiest licks ever.  His solos are both adventurous and melodic.  The songs are great.  If you love classic 80s metal with phenominal guitar, buy this!
0312263120|2.0|The measure of good fiction is how well it allows you to detach yourself from reality and believe in its premise. This, then, was Digital Fortress' first failing - it was unbelievable, no matter how hard I tried. Readability is another measure of good fiction and this book seemed very readable. However, I was stuck on an airplane for five hours when I read it, or I, probably, wouldn't have found it very readable.<br />A good story would have made me believe an unbreakable code was possible. In this work, the very reason given as to why the code was \\"unbreakable\\" was the reason it was breakable. Even with no knowledge of codes or cyphers, any logical person would have been able to figure this out. Once this has been figured out, the rest of the book is entirely predictable. The book revealed that the author knew the names of many data encyrption methods, (he dropped names of all the \\"popular\\" encryption methods), and that he, probably, has a rudimentary understanding of how they work, (the statement that ULTRA transmissions encrypted by the Engima machine were always sent in groups of four letters showed how little he really knew about the practical application of cryptography). However, as soon as he had explained how things work in the real world of cryptography, he contradicted himself and started explaining things his way. Perhaps it would have worked, if one were willing forget everything they had just read.<br />In reality, though, this book wasn't about cryptography. The code was just a foil. Unfortunately, the underlying story was so thin the author had to rely on cryptographic mumbo-jumbo to carry the book. When that didn't work, he should have been able to rely on his characters. Too bad his characters were more predictable than the story. From his ultra-conservative heroine who believed the government reading everyone's communications was necessary for our \\"protection,\\" (who's character ranged from highly competent to hysterical in the same paragraph) to the ultra-libertarian who believed in an absolute right to privacy, the characters were boring and predictable. It would have helped if he had done some more character development, but, alas, he filled the book with meaningless cybertalk instead. The author's trivializing of the efforts of civil libertarians, such as the EFF, who work to preserve civil rights on the Internet was insulting and contributed nothing to the story.<br />Finally, the one saving grace of the book was the introduction of the concept of \\"Quis custodient ipsos custodes,\\" or \\"who guards the guards\\"? After seeing men dressed in black, carrying assault rifles with their fingers on the triggers in downtown Philadelphia this week, allegedly \\"protecting\\" us from some nebulous threat that was never defined, I think this is a question all of us need to ask ourselves.

B00005JLSE|2.0|First, I love all of the stars in this movie.  Richard Gere (since American Gigolo), Renée Zellweger and Queen Latifa are all favorites of mine.  I had never seen Catherine Zeta-Jones, but I was impressed with her talent, too.  It was very cool to see them together in a musical because, other than QL, I had no idea that they all had song & dance type talent.  So, for that reason, I guess that I am glad to have seen \\"Chicago.\\"<br />Despite the raw talent that was oozing from the screen, my discontent with this movie lies in two facts.  It moves (way)too slowly, and it is VERY dark in both appearance and in subject matter.  I even caught myself nodding off a few times....  I would not watch it again.<br />If you want to see a gripping musical, watch Moulin Rouge.
0385504209|5.0|&lt;i&gt;While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, a baffling cipher found near the body. As Langdon and a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci...clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.&lt;/i&gt;<br />...And so begins the Holy Grail hunt from Paris to London and back again.<br />My Mom often tells me to be careful what I read. She's afraid I'll be influenced by the dark side or sucked into beliefs that will send me to hell. Fortunately for me, my mind is not that weak. I have yet to read anything that has caused me to denounce God or not believe in His Son, Jesus. My faith is simple and not overcomplicated by the ravings of man.<br />My advice to you while reading this book is to read it with entertainment in mind. THE DA VINCI CODE will probably offend some Christians because there is a mention of Jesus and Mary Magdalene being married, touching on THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. Some Catholics will be offended because they are accused of suppressing other religions by turning their symbols into something evil, and trying to hide the truth of God, even going as far as to murder to protect the secret.<br />Even though Leonardo Da Vinci painted such masterpieces as THE LAST SUPPER and VIRGIN ON THE ROCKS he often mocked the church and &quot;painted Christian themes not as an expression of his own beliefs but rather as a commercial venture...a means of funding a lavish lifestyle&quot;. He also placed hidden symbols of paganism in his work. Believe it or not, I was a bit shocked by this discovery. I once thought Leonardo Da Vinci must have loved God a lot to paint such beautiful pictures! Now I'm not so sure, but only God knew Da Vinci's true heart, lest I should judge.<br />I learned something about THE LAST SUPPER painting I didn't know and was quite fascinated by! I can't tell you what it was without giving too much of the novel away, but if you're the curious sort I am, you'll find yourself running to the dining room at two in the morning to see if your copy of the painting is the one done by Da Vinci. Mine wasn't, so I had to get Online and search for THE LAST SUPPER.<br />Not only is THE DA VINCI CODE a darn good mystery/thriller, it's also a fascinating look at religious history. All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate. Dan Brown has done an excellent job striking the right balance between fact and fiction to make this an enthralling read. I found myself trying to break each code along with Robert and Sophia and laughing when they too came up with the same wrong answer I did.something about THE LAST SUPPER painting I didn't know and was quite fascinated by!

B00008YJHC|5.0|This album is their least 'raw' album.The singing is smoother, though still the trade-mark neurotic traits of Black Francis' expression.There is even some semi-ethereal approach to it.But there is only so ethereal that the Pixies get.It's still full of the one-of-a-kind emotional angles to the lyrics.Nobody else would say those things the way 'Blacky' does (as if I'm on nick-name basis with him).<br />The melodies are great.Theres always a reverb sound of one sort or another in the songs.So it sounds like they were in outer-space when they dreamt this music.The cover is a good reflection of their approach to this album.One cute piece of Pixies humour is that amongst all these smooth songs (by their standards I mean), Mr.Francis failed(chose to fail) to resist the temptation to pop in a certifyable !VOICE THRASHING!(at track 2).<br />This album is different in purpose than their thrashier ones, but certainly equal in quality.Quite 'beautiful' actually.(My favourite, for now.)

B0000399WI|5.0|Based on a Stephen King novella and directed by Frank Darabont, this film covers a 20-year period during which Andy Defresne (Robbins), a former banker convicted of murder, somehow preserves his dignity while surviving the brutalities he endures in a state prison in Maine. There are many reasons why this film retains its appeal to me during the eight years since I first saw it. Here are three. First, the evolving friendship between Defresne and \\"Red\\" Redding (Freeman) enables both actors to play off each other while developing their respective, quite different characters. (Color of skin is among the least significant of those differences.) Also, the unhurried pace of the film seems appropriate to the pace of life within a state prison. While seeing this film once again recently, although familiar with all plot details, I found myself relaxing and \\"going with the flow\\" the way many inmates presumably do. Darabont's skillful control of the pace givens sudden, unexpected plot developments even greater dramatic force. Finally, I admire Bob Gunton's portrayal of Warden Samuel Norton, a clever but corrupt and (when he deems it necessary) brutal public official. His fate is obviously not the \\"redemption\\" he has in mind for himself. FYI, cinematographer Roger Deakins was later hired by the Brothers Cohen to provide his services to the filming of Fargo. The Shawshank Redemption now has and certainly deserves a high level of esteem which it did not (but should) have when first released in 1994.
B00008EYA5|5.0|I'd like to say I was disappointed by this film, but I was pretty sure hollywood wouldn't be able to do this film without turning it into a phony macho excerise in bad story telling. No, wait there was no real story. The film was just a frame work to hang a story about a bunch over hammy macho acting on. I'm really disappointed in Samuel L Jackson for added his considerable reputation to this piece of dreck.<BR>I do recommend this film if you let you 13 year olds watch a fim with this rating.
B000002I2G|4.0|The idea to combine their already unique sound with classical orchestration, is an example of the trial and error nature of developing art that stands out.So their willingness to attempt original ideas is the only reason we even know who they are.So their 'attempt' doesn't deserve any criticim.Only the 'execution' on this album is shorter-falling than The Doors' full potential.<br />I believe the Doors could've sought advice from the \\"60's TV Themes\\" crowd, on how to blend brass and strings with rock music.Artists like Henry Mancini(Pink Panther Theme) and John Barry (James Bond Theme) may have had advice to keep the Doors from falling into any traps and 'no-no's' of this style composing.<br />One other aspect of this album, as with 'Waiting For The Sun', is that the diversity between the soft and hard songs is a bit 'too' diverse.So the cohesion and flow isn't as fluent as their other albums.So, they made some slip-ups, yes.But, this music is really passionate and unique.
0385504209|5.0|Wow, this book has a range of reviews! I guess that is to be expected given the subject matter of the book. I am starting to think that the topics of religion and politics just should not be discussed amongst friends. I think most people are just too thin-skinned, self-important, immature and closed-minded to discuss either of these topics rationally. I will break it down to simple terms. If you are a fan of books in the 'historical fiction' genre (as I am), then you will love this book. If you are an ultra-conservative, bible-thumping zealot then maybe you should just buy another cook book. Read the reviews, even many of the book's detractors admit it is well researched and that the plot is quite suspenseful. This book appeals to me. I am not particularly pious, but I love much of the Renaissance artwork, perhaps even more so for its, often, very religous themes. So, this book appeals to me in many ways. If you have enjoyed books by Robert Ludlum, Ken Follet or Greg Iles, then I think you will enjoy this book as well.

0380789019|4.0|i was first introduced to gaiman's prose a few years back through his work with terry pratchett in good omens. ever since then, i've been an avid fan of his writing. this book is just another excellent glimpse into the inner working of his mind, and it's magnificent.    this is obviously a homage to london's underground, a labyrinthine network that crawls under the belly of london. anybody who's familiar with the underground understands how it can be a world of it's own, and that's just what gaiman capitalized in neverwhere. what if there's a separate \\"reality\\" surviving around and within the structure? the world of london below is like a world eerily similar to our own - only that it's like a few centuries late. while we might be intrigued by what is similar, there is undeniably an undercurrent which is alien to what we know of our world - the magic, customs and society of london below is definitely NOT of this world either.    it all started when richard helped what he thought was a homeless, a girl called 'door', that he found bleeding in the underground. that single gesture of pity slowly plunges him into the dark, disturbing world of london below, where he finds himself getting in over his head. suddenly he finds that nobody in london above (our world) remembers him, and his life was singularly erased as he becomes aware of the sprawling city below. with bounty hunters, magic and intrigue plaguing every step he takes with 'door', he realize that this may seem like a nightmare, except that it might be one he may never wake up from.    neverwhere is not only a dedication to the vast subway structure of london, it's also a discussion about issues - if we may call it such - like homelessness, existence, loyalty, identity and mostly how modern life makes us oblivious to the suffering and problems of fellow humans. it shows that even as richard loses his previous identity on london above, he slowly receives another identity in london below, one based on his actions and virtues alone. yet, this seemingly complex discourse over the issues are deftly handled by gaiman, and the gritty, grim and menacing london below bloomed into life and is as real as anything we know on this world.    the great thing about this book is that it can be enjoyed on any level; older children will find it as every bit exciting as lewis carroll's alice in wonderland while adults can appreciate the wry observation about life. all in all, a great book that any fantasy or sci-fi reader will enjoy.
B000069AUI|1.0|What is all the ballyhoo and bruhaha over this band? This frenzy over the greatest alt band going, best of the year, music press darlings - oh come on. This is the stuff of The Emperor's New Clothes. Please for heaven's sake will somebody call the bluff. The incredible number of creatively superior bands and musicians that are occluded by the likes of this lifeless, depressing slop is almost criminal. Want to hear someting exciting, go buy Porcupine Tree's &quot;In Absentia&quot; and find out what you're missing.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I have been an X-Men fan for a while, and I saw this in the theatre.  Everything I expected and more.  The effects are spectacular, and there are some new characters that are especially fun.  It builds on the first film well.<br />The first DVD in the set is just the movie and a commentary, and the second DVD is full of extras, including some making of the movie spots, deleted scenes, and photoalbum.
B00008PW2D|4.0|Before writing my review, I read many of the already written reviews (mostly negative I might add) and I watched all 8 episodes of Season 5. Relax...if you are a die hard Sex and the City fan, stop obsessing over the price.  As for Season 5, I think it was better than worse.  Could it have been better...sure; but it could've been a lot worse.  So the girls weren't \\"men-obsessed\\" like the usual seasons.  This season allowed the girls to look deep into their \\"single-selves.\\"  Being single and all alone sucks, and this season showed that.  Everyone gets lonely, so it was inevitable that our favorite and fabulous girls were bound to feel the brunt of our pain.  In this season we seem to get deeper into the character lives.  We find out what fuels their passion, love, and desire..it's just a matter of whether or not their tank is full!  The only problem I had with this season was Carrie's clothes.  I know she was prego and all, but come on!  Her fashion sense is what drives this show.  This season consisted of too many long and short tunic like frocks!  Sure they were designers like Juicy...but a designer frock is still a frock!  HBO could've at least beefed up her accessories with infamous purses or shoes!  As for the rest...Carrie hearts NY and I heart Sex and the City!
B00000JMQE|5.0|L. Frank Baum would be very happy with this movie in my opinion. This movie is based so much on the books and Disney did a good job staying with the storylines in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Land of Oz.&quot;<br />This movie was one of my childhood favorites even though I admit it is a little on the dark side! But it is a great film that in my opinion could be considered a classic.<br />Join Dorothy, Billinia, Jack, Tik-Tok, the Gump, and some old favorites on a journey back to Oz!<br />This should not be compared to the original as it is a movie all on its own. The original &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; is a timeless claasic and this movie is often not recognized for its greatness because so many people want to compare it.<br />Enjoy this film for what it is and please use no comparisons and I think you will find it very enjoyable!<br />This movie is great and I highly recommend owning it if you are an Oz fan!<br />I have to admit I was a tad disapointed that there were not many DVD extras but there is a new edition coming out in February &quot;04&quot; so I will be waiting for that edition as well! Maybe it will contain more extras! :-)<br />This is a movie that has been misunderstood throughout the years but when not compared and just enjoyed, it is in a league all of its own! Enjoy! :-)
B00009V7T2|5.0|The last time I checked prog rock were a bunch of dudes masturbating on their instruments and doing 20 minute jam sessions with laser lights and fog machines and big walls being constructed during the sets or pigs flying over the crowd etc etc.  Don't get me wrong I love some of those bands (of course in small doses and usually because I respect them as musicians) but the Mars Volta are not a prog rock band and I'm sick and tired of hearing people review this album and describe them as that.  Are they mechanical and cold?  I don't think so but most Progressive bands ended up sounding that that.  That's what punk rock was not about and this is in many ways just a more complex thought out punk album with a lot of influences from different music's.  Just cause a band has six minute songs doesn't mean they are progressive.  John Coltrane had six minute songs and the last I checked he was a Jazz musician.  Anyway, this album is way too emotional and frantic to be bunched into some boring and dead scene from the 1970's.  It has all the emotion and intensity of the early Bad Brains and the feeling of early 1980's punk but more complex.  It is more polished and that's the way it should be.  I like At The Drive In but listening to ATDI and then listening to this is almost like choosing Kenny G over Charlie Parker.  There is no comparison.  The Mars Volta blows ATDI away.  This record never gets boring I don't care how long the songs are.  The best album I've heard all year.  Listen to this and it'll but a little hop in your step.  Cha Cha your ass to the store and buy this thing.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I really didnt enjoy this season... and I want to buy it.. probably used in the long run just to have in my collection, but for now, I trust my faithful downloading softwear to keep money in my pocket and my mind pseudo-entertained.  Thanks for sharing.
0679428895|3.0|Pompeii is an entertaining novel with a bare bones plot and a small number of characters. The description of Pompeii and the surrounding area, the discussion of the Aqua Augusta, and the rendition of Vesuvious erupting is excellent.<br />However, the main character - Attilius - and his love interest are rather bland and one dimensional. A serious flaw - to have a main character and a love story poorly developed and of little interest to the reader.<br />The secondary characters are fabulous though - Pliny the Elder, the bad guy Ampliatus, Brebix the gladiaitor, the short scene with a prostitute and the \\"never seen\\" Exomnius. These are just some examples.<br />One final flaw - the book ends with a whimper and not a bang. Almost as if the deadline was up and the author just tied all loose ends together and submitted the work.<br />I do recommend the novel though. The novel is well written and for all it flaws it is as they say: \\"a good read\\".
B00008EYA5|3.0|Cant say that I completely disliked the movie but it simply is not good enough to be in my collection.Some of the action scenes are okay but they are too sporadic and the story was very weak.The acting by the cast was decent but I did not care too much for some of the actors.This is just another mindless action movie which may appeal to people who liked bad boys 2.TRUST ME AND SAVE YOUR MONEY BY NOT BUYING THIS AVERAGE MOVIE!!!
B00005KHJR|5.0|With this film's history, especially the struggle to gain realistic distribution and to restore something of the original content, you simply cannot afford to let this superb 2 disc set slip by. It has taken many years to get this much together, and if it were to become unavailable... I strongly urge you to get it while you can.<br />Whether we will ever see a more complete version is a total unknown, but this exquisitely packaged set offers the fullest version yet seen, primarily consisting of the scenes on the Scottish mainland which set the background to Howie and the mystery letter mentioning the disappearance of Rowan Morrison.<br />This is unquestionably an Art movie, in the same sense that Jacob's Ladder and Don't Look Now (a Wicker Man stablemate) were. Yet it manages to entertain on many levels, being both visually and aurally compelling. <br />The soundtrack by the sadly late Paul Giovanni is simply stunning and the recently-released soundtrack album, which includes the haunting Gently Johnny, is another must for the serious fan. The Wicker Man soundtrack has always been the Unholy Grail of soundtrack albums, so again, I wouldn't let it slip away.<br />There have been so many superb reviews that I won't go into plot details here, but I would like to attest to the excellent job the creators of this wonderful 2 disc set have done, right down to the ingenious wooden case. The Extras are superb, especially the lengthy interview/documentary footage with Hardy and Shaffer and the excellent Ingrid Pitt, Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward. While through no fault of her own, Ingrid's role is barely more than a cameo, Woodward and Lee give some of the best performances of their impressive careers.<br />While I would not consider the movie to be a Horror movie as such, the suspense builds majestically, and the only violence is entirely in context. Similarly, the nudity is tasteful and entirely valid within the context of a movie set in a pagan community. Britt shines in Willow's temptress dance and Ingrid Pitt delivers a masterfully understated and all-too-brief wordless performance in the search scene where Howie enters her cottage unannounced, to find her in the bath. If you're a total Ingrid Pitt fan, as I always have been, the Step and Slow keys will enable you to savor this vampish delivery.<br />This is one of those rare movies in which the sets, the music, the casting, the locations, the production and direction and screenplay simply cannot be faulted. Having bought the superb making-of book Inside The Wicker Man from Amazon UK, this double DVD is just the icing on the cake, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

B00006D295|1.0|It is totally lost on me how this film has a such a cult following. I'm  no stranger to the macabre, the bizarre, or a mix of the two. But to what purpose does all of this serve?<BR>It's not scary, and not funny. The song lyrics are one-note, juvenile and lame. &quot;Damn it, Janet&quot; over and over.<br />Har har har.<br />The cult status is almost sickening.  Just look at the negative votes on the one-star reviews, no matter how well-written they are.  That's right, the fanboys just want to de-grade sensible, well-written reviews. If you like the film, that's fine, I'm glad you took something away from the experience that I didn't. But don't hate me cause I hated it.<br />I found it too long, too juvenile, convoluted, and shock-value-ridden. For midnight-drive in junkies re-living their pasts, im sure its great. But outsiders, ye be warned
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A DVD set which does justice to one of the best (albeit shortest lived) television series. Top rate stories, acting, and special effects in a quirky, intelligent, and very exciting western-sci-fi. Seriously one the great tragedies of television history was the premature cancellation of this series. The DVD is packed with extras and gorgeous to behold, especially in a wide screen format. It comes a small consolation, but at least FOX gave us a quality DVD set.
B00006690G|1.0|HE SUCKS! When marshall mathers and slim shady were out, Eminem was my favorite rapper! but he sucks now. Dady's Gone Crazy was good, but that is it. Do NOT spend your money on this.

B00006CXXU|1.0|This cd was okay, but no two star review though. Except for some okay songs, this CD will be in the Bargin Bin at Tower before we know(and it won't be there so they can order more, it will be there just to off load the remander of the CD's that they can't sell) Even though Christina is a grammy winner, does mean that she is any good any more. To put it the word's of Hilary Duff's song(NOT, I repeat NOT her own opinion about Christina,but in a song of hers) Christina is 'so yesterday'. Save your money and buy one of her other CD's or buy the CD's from the 'not real artists' that does not appeal to her own vanity. So, save your money. However, if you really want this  CD go to the  used CD's bin or just burn it off your friend or something, but just save your  19 some odd dollars and spend it on something else
B0000028WD|3.0|Sorry, but the best performance is Johnny Winters ripping through Highway 61 (revisited)- a lot of the other performers (including George Harrison and Ronnie Wood pale by comparison). Why can't I get it on DVD?
0142004235|3.0|If you want to read an author who can almost effortlessly draw you into the tapestry of his characters, in 600 pages and yet without frittering away a single word, then you have to love Steinbeck! What makes this 1952 novel the timeless opus that I believe it is (now fortunately in new paperback version thanks to Oprah,)  is that ANY reader can relate to it on so many levels.<br />You may find the story winding and complicated at the outset, peopled by characters that are often virtuous in some ways and flawed in others. But soon you'll realize how real these people are, and you'll be reading on if only to figure out what happens to each of them. The plot and the author's beautiful descriptive passages pull you along at a refreshing pace once you are into it.<br />Although the main character's name is Adam, it's the Biblical story of Cain and Abel that is played out over and over with characters whose names begin with \\"C\\" and \\"A\\". Adam's father, Cyrus, is quite the wild man. Adam's brother, Charles, tries to kill him. Adam's wife, Cathy, abandons him and their newborn twins to pursue the lifestyle of evil she cannot escape. Their children Aron and Caleb continue as opponents trying to vie for their father's attention until the bitter end.<br />And when you finish trudging through the entire thing, you'll feel like having actually lived and breathed the philosophies and lessons of a lifetime. Steinbeck's acute awareness of the interplay of his themes despite his lingusitic economy is an absolute joy to behold. His characters are specific and alive, mirroring real people and their foibles.<br />I highly recommend this classic piece of literature but be prepared to read. It's not your average pulp.

B0000039QA|5.0|This album is a classic. It has VERY dope beats. Cool lyrics, but beats, they are just awesome. It includes MOST of biggie's great hits. In my opinion, two of my three favorites are not hits...but i don't care. My three favorites are &quot;Ten Crack Commandments&quot;, &quot;Notorious Thugs&quot; and &quot;Mo Money, Mo Problems&quot; This is a very good album. This was one of the first cds i got, and it is one of my favorites. You all should think about buying this album. and if you do, then i hope ya like it. I hope my review helped. Oh, by the way, does anybody know who all those people are in Notorious Thugs? I must know.
B00005JLYW|5.0|This action packed segqual to the First Charlie's Angels is going \\"Full Throtal\\" into a brand new movie. The Angels are back and better than ever! Along with a bad-girl Angel Demi Moore. These Angels will kick anybody's you-know-what if they have to.<BR>This movie is better than the first. More action, less laughs. They even show more skin(tasefully though) There is no actual in-your-face-nudity, just emplyed nudity. You will not be let down by these Heavenly Angels in this enstallment in The Angel series. An Angel from The show even makes a cameo(hint: Not Farrah, not Cheryle, not Kate, not Tonya, not Shelly, Hmmmmmm, who can it be? I wonder.....
B000089RVR|5.0|Prior to listeneing to the album, i had only heard the one song, White Flag, and i hoped that the rest of the album would match the song.   I wasn't dissapointed as Life for Rent is filled with great songs, with a variety that makes this an enjoyable album.  Best songs on it, in my opnion, are WHite Flag and Life for Rent.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Man, oh man!  This show hooked me from the beginning.  I'm planning on seeing it this spring!<br />Kristin Chenoweth is a delight, as always, and displays all her gifts: high, low, coloratura, belt...you name it, she pulls it off with that bright crystal-clear voice and perfect comic timing.<br />Idina Menzel is fierce...a wonder.  &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; will blow you away, but &quot;The Wizard and I&quot; is my favorite number of hers.  Powerful singing!  Hopefully, Julia Murney (she and Menzel were in the Lippa &quot;Wild Party&quot; together...Murney was Queenie) can step into that part sometime...I'd love to hear what she could do with Elphaba!<br />Stephen Schwartz has a big, big hit on his hands...look for this show at Tony time.  Menzel is a shoo-in for Best Actress in a Musical, and the awards won't stop there.<br />Get this CD!
0061020710|5.0|Of course, this being the 1st in the Discworld series, there is no better place to start. Terry Pratchett offers more than just the necessary Fantasy fix for those that enjoy that genre. His humorous points of view regarding the world in general will have you in stitches no matter what genre you prefer to read. Trust me, I translated this to Spanish and gave it to my grandmother to read, she calls me every week to ask when the next translated book from Terry Pratchett will be completed.<br />Purchase with no fear and enjoy!
B00006CXXU|1.0|this cd was terrible! trust me, don't even listen to it on the radio. except maybe 'dirty' or'can't hold us down' or'im okay' i can't even rember any other song except those. even with thse, i had to rack my brain. there no remberal tracks on this cd. the only reason why i bought it was because i heard that it was good. well, that person(who is a friend of mine) needs to listen to actual music like, sarah mcglochlen or cheryl crowe or pat benatar,anybody besides christina. spend your money else where.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|As far as soundtracks go, lets face it, most aren't that memorable or impressive.  They tend to simply be another way to make money off of a movie.  Pirates of the Caribbean is the exception.  Even though it is all orchestral, it is not boring in the least, even to me, a fan of hard rock.  I would recomment this soundtrack to anyone wanting interesting, rivoting music, and especially to fans of the movie.
0140277447|5.0|Japanese men are infamous on victimizing, bounding up women severly and in practicing 'bukkake' in pornography. After reading sections of the book, I think I have just made the connection, comparing to that, to incidents where daughters and mothers and grandmothers and grand-daughters in Nanking were savagely raped, tortued, then disposed of mercilessly!!<br />May all the Chinese people who perished in Nanking rest their souls.
B000000LZV|5.0|Strap this on and get yer brains blown back!! The hottest album of the 80's with absolutely no rivals. I found this as a young teen and thought it looked cool. I had no idea what it was. My first thought was that they were just bad musicians with bad haircuts. For some reason, I stuck with this record, though at the time it was way over my head. I could not stop listening to it nonetheless, and just figured I was a weird-o. Almost 20 years later, my lord does this stand up! This is an absolute must for anyone between the ages of 16-40. Gritty, heavy, and oh-so jazzy. PURE POWER!<br />As an adult, the first thing that you notice about these cats is that they are smarter than you. They are also much, much braver. Minutemen fearlessly burn through country, folk, funk, punk, jazz, latin, rock, disco and will bust your as* in about 30 seconds flat. I still have no idea how a bunch of YOUNG(!) jitterbugs made this record. This is probably the greatest album ever recorded. 100% raw from tip-to-tail. All burners. One of the those seriously RARE records you can just put on, front to back, with no dry spots.<br />This D. Boon guy is so sensational words fail me. He wrote songs that shaped my life. His voice, lyrics and playing set a tone for my youth. I used to gaze at the album art all night doing shots of Popov. I couldnt figure out who this guy was. His voice was pretty awful, his guitar-work was sloppy as all get-out, and best of all, he was really fat &amp; sweaty.....how did his sausage fingers play those blazing scales &amp; leads?? Holmes would rock-out till the wheels fell off, and probably got paid about 50 bucks to make this masterpiece. What I am trying to say here is that this was the most righteous dude to ever play music. An unbelievable loss. Thank you, D. Boon. Words are not enough.<br />As young bucks, my brother, cousin &amp; I used to spin the grooves off this joint. It was the &quot;coin of the realm&quot; and we knew every phrase, chord, and line on it.Nobody we knew had even heard of Minutemen, so we just had to sack-up and form our own little squad. We were so absorbed in this thing, it wasnt even worth trying to turn some other 15 year-old on to it. It just didnt translate. We literally idolized these guys. The outfits alone were so terrific it made your head spin.<br />If you found your way to this album review, I IMPLORE you to buy this cd, and before it arrives, go out and buy the vinyl (and a turntable if you have to) as well. Then buy every other album you can find by Minutemen. This CD has been chopped up to make it fit on one disk, and many tracks are faded out early, to my huge disappointment. YOU NEED THIS FOR YOUR CAR, though, dont get me wrong! You absolutely HAVE to have this record on vinyl to experience it properly. The liner notes/artwork really add spice to it. DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS.....nuts&amp;sorbe

B00008H2LB|2.0|I seem to have a slight problem with what linkin park does in general, and it might just be me.  Most rap/metal bands like Limp Bizkit have a head/banging element to the vocals when they are rapped (not that I worship them tremendously either).  Not linkin park, however.  Mike sounds like any other rapper out there; only the music and what he raps about separate him.  It's like most of LP's songs go from rap mode to metal mode, and that's highly irritating for metal fans like me; you can't get the same kind head-banging energy from rap that you can from metal.  Not that this album doesn't contain some good tracks.  &quot;Don't Stay&quot; is pretty much Mike-free, and the music kicks ass.  &quot;From the Inside&quot; does rap a little, but I can seem to tolerate it, mostly because the music is very intense and Chester's voice goes from soft to screams that bring this song to life (this song probably should have ended the album; just seems like a closure piece).  &quot;Numb&quot; is more of a pop song, but is incredibly catchy; once again, pretty Mike-free.  However, almost every other song has too much rap for its own good.  If you're into hip-hop and pop, you may find this album too heavy; if you're into hard rock, this album may not be hard enough.  For me, if it wasn't for the rapping, I probably would like LP way more.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a short lived series that packed alot of punch. The idea of a sci-fi western apparently didn't appeal to the general viewing public. The series had great acting, great effects. Full of awesome themes that parrellel todays society. Excellently written. I only wish this had more seaons to expand on the characters. great series worthy of classic sci-fi dom.
0385504209|1.0|I love a good page turner as much as anybody, and this one is a doozy, but for al the wrong reasons. It's so easy to pick on the Catholic Church, and particularly Opus Dei, but having been on the inside of both, I can tell you that the factual errors are overwhelming, and dangerously misleading.<br />While it's true that ALL religions are man's attempt to put God in a bottle, and to put that bottle on an altar, and build a temple around that altar creating rubrics and rituals to circumscribe the &quot;faithful&quot; from the &quot;heathens&quot;, (and that this leads directly to a &quot;my God's bigger than your God&quot; mentality), there is NO hierarchical conspiracy going back in the mists of time to supress &quot;the divine feminine&quot; in Catholicism. The emphasis on Mary (his mother, not Magdelen) in the last several hundred years in the Catholic Church has given rise to a Protestant backlash that thinks Catholics have gone too far, and that in fact they worship the mother of Jesus. It was in the 1800's  that Mary's Assumption into heaven was promulgated by the Church, and that put her on a par with Pentecost. You've come a long way baby...<br />As for Opus Dei, their penchant for penance is what most Catholic priestly orders ( Jesuits, I know of first hand )did before Vatican II, they just never stopped the practice, and carry it over from their founding. But the cloak and daggar stuff is just ridiculous, and so ultimately, is this book.
0345446798|4.0|Within a few hours of finishing this book my dog started barking outside.  My husband thought that perhaps the dog across the road was out again.  so I looked outside at my dog and told my husband that it was the kids not the dog that were out across the street.  the dog was showing the come play with me attitude not the dominance display, and I finally got the signals!<br />Wonderfully intutive and a good read. Full of lots of fun stories and information in an easy to read format that really helps with all dogs.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|With all due respect to the concert, one thing that made me watch this DVD so many times was Sam Brown's rendition of Horse on the Water.  For me, I have discovered a singer whose voice is so forceful that it actually made me fall in love with her.  WHAT A SONG!!!  WHAT A SINGER!!!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Yo,I check out all the reviews, and they say &quot;A Music Fan&quot;..... What's wrong, too ashamed to admit you like Britney? <br />Her music is pathetic; it only proves that anyone with good looks (her only asset) can make it big in music biz. Sure, she has a decent voice, but most of us do (unless you're tone-deaf)<br />Bet you anything Brit wouldn't be as big without her looks. If we were all blind, no one would like her.<br />I grow weary of reviewing all this bull**** music these days. Find me some artists who don't sell out, and I'll be happy. Until then, the only music I can appreciate these days is the White Stripes. <br />(I am under 35 (actually under 25 too), and male, so don't think I'm another one of those parents who disapprove of her or anything.)<br />Too bad I can't rate lower than one star. I would.
0385504209|5.0|Wow!  I could not put this book down.  A real page turner through out!  I raced to find a DaVinci Art book so I could get a closer look at his work--couldn't believe my eyes--its's true!

B000089RVR|3.0|Dido has one of the most beautiful voices out there, and she shows it off again with her sophmore album, &quot;Life for Rent&quot;. This album is a continuation of her first disc, showing the audience that she has decided to stick what has already proven to work for her. Not that there is anything wrong with that, and there should not be a problem with an artist maintaining their fan base before attempting to push their musical boundaries. I would have liked to see her take a couple of tracks on this album and really mix things up, but since she hasn't, it gives listeners something to hope for on her third disc. <br />There are a handful of great tracks on this album, including &quot;White Flag&quot; and &quot;Do You Have A Little Time&quot;. You cannot resist the trip-hop beats and subtle acoustic guitar that graces most of her songs, the music almost as important as her angelic voice singing over top. <br />Simply put, if you liked &quot;No Angel&quot;, then you will have no reason to dislike &quot;Life for Rent&quot;. Hopefully she moves along for her next project, but for now, she has avoided the sophmore curse that plagues so many artists.
0380799006|4.0|This book is useful not only for dealing with sibling rivalry, but also with diffusing conflicts between any children. It is valuable not only for parents but also for those adults who regularly deal with children avocationally (as in Scouts, or AWANA Clubs) as well as professionally (school teachers). This book refrains from dry theory. To the contrary: It contains many cartoons that depict a common response to childrens' conflicts versus a much better way of handling these conflicts. The conflicts dealt with range from children's feelings of adult favoritism all the way to open fighting.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|He's done it again - Stephen Schwartz has yet again proven that good musicals can come to broadway and make a home.<br />Many people have already made valid points about the show and the music.  As a Theater teacher, I just say this is one musical CD you should NOT be without!<br />Expect to see this cast performing at the 2004 Tony awards and racking up the awards because this show is truly WICKED in every single way!!
B00005JMFI|1.0|I was so disappointed with this movie.<br />I really like Will Ferrell, but this movie didn't do him justice.  This movie is so cheesy!  The beginning drags on and the rest of the movie just falls flat.  The only funny parts are what you have seen in previews.<br />Save your money.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Beside being a bad singer and put out a TERRIBLE CD, Britney now is trying to put up the bad sales of her CD with a new IMATURE SCANDAL. If want to know about IMATURITY contact Britney. I wish she could read my review. This CD is HORRIBLE and a wast of MONEY.
0385504209|1.0|The fact that this book is so popular is because it is so infantile and general that it appeals to the very general public.  It's a successful heresy in paper though, because the general public seems to easily accept such follies presented in a novel.  Such an untruth as the idea that Christ was married to Mary Magdalene is laughable.  This is a novel by a foolish anti-Catholic upstart.<br />Only fools can be swayed by lies in mystery novels.
B00003CXWV|5.0|This movie was excellent!  Even though I was not alive during this time period of George Jung's peak of sucess I feel as if i could tell anyone who asks about the Coloumbian- American drug trade or at least the George Jung part.  the most interesting fact about the movie is that in the 80's if you bought cocaine there was an 85% chance that it came from George Jung and Derek Foreel.-i think that is how u spell it.  this movie is such a good movie but if i saw this movie last year when i was 13 i would never of understood many instances of the movie.  THIS IS A MOVIE THAT YOU CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN!

B0000C6E4D|5.0|Gets better with every listen. I never really spent a lot of time with her stuff until Mirrorball, too slow, although I had all of it. Then with Mirrorball, the fire in her presentation changed all that. Afterglow is not a paean to angst, maybe her growth has changed her outlook, so what? Do you expect stasis? Should she be true to herself or to you?<BR>Her voice, arrangement, melody, all, stunning.<BR>The best yet.
B00006CXXU|5.0|After Christina's comeback with the video for Dirrty, I was ready to write her off completely. But then I heard Stripped and I found it impossible to totally dislike her. Unlike her rival Britney, Christina actually has talent to back up her idiotic raunchy stunts. Aguilera is so disgusting she makes me gag...but she is one of the best vocalists out there and Stripped is one of the best albums I've ever heard. With the exceptions of a couple songs, this album isn't as sexually charged as you'd think it would be. Well, let's begin:<br />Can't Hold Us Down (featuring Lil' Kim) - A feminists anthem. I happen not to agree with this song. She's saying - well, you've heard it. The notion of the guys do it so that makes us right is just stupid. I also despise Lil' Kim. But I like this song overall. It has a good beat. Is she referring to Eminem and Fred Durst? 9/10<br />Walk Away - This song is too long (almost six minutes). Very jazzy. The song is kinda boring until the last couple of minutes or so. Not one of my favorites but I see what she was trying to achieve. 6 1/2 / 10<br />Fighter - This was my favorite song right away. Christina's vocals floor me. I'd like to hear Mariah try and sing this one! 10/10<br />Infatuation - A bilingual song. Not very interesting vocally, lyrically or otherwise. This song is one of the few I skip over. 5 /2 / 10<br />Loving Me 4 Me - Again, doesn't hold my interest at all. 4/10<br />Impossible - This song was written, produced and arranged by Alicia Keys so it sounds like something she'd sing. Christina sings it better than Alicia could ever dream of. One of my favorites. 10/10<br />Underappreciated - Another female empowerment song. I've heard a million R&B songs like it. I thought it was a cover until I saw that she wrote it. 5/10<br />Beautiful - Words cannot describe how much I love this song. I could've done without the homosexual driven video but... 10/10<br />Make Over - I had to take an Advil the first time I heard this one but I love it. It sounds like a song that was scrapped from Pink's Missundaztood album. Linda Perry, whom Pink worked with on Missundaztood, co-wrote and produced this song. 8/10<br />Cruz - I love this one. Another great ballad. 9/10<br />Soar - Very inspiring. 9/10<br />Get Mine, Get Yours - Well, my enjoyment came to a hault right here. This song is about casual sex. I know she sings about all types of relationships on this CD but I can't accept this. Terrible. 2/10<br />Dirrty - Two sexual songs after another. Unlike the previous song, I actually like this one. I mean, the vocals and arrangement are so different that I don't pay any attention to the words. I really like the vocal acrobatics here. I hate the video but the song is pretty good. 8 1/2 / 10<br />The Voice Within - I always liked this song but I love it more than ever now after seeing the video. Britney could never do a song like this that actually means something to people. 10/10<br />I'm Okay - This song is really heart wrenching. Christina sings about the physical abuse that she and her mother endured and how she deals with the emotional scars everyday of her life. 10/10<br />Keep On Singing My Song - Kind of like Soar. Very inspiring. 9/10<br />No matter how much I dislike Christina Aguilera in other ways, she proved with this album that her talent is far and beyond her female constituents. Britney Spears, Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson - they are all put to shame with this album.love it. It sounds like a song that was scrapped from Pink's Missundaztood album.

B00005JMCW|5.0|I loved Freak Friday. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsey Lohan appear so natural working beside eachother. It's like they have known eachother their whole life. The movie is full of humor, but it also has a serious message. It's full of real issues with everyone relates too. Whether it's problems with your parents or a ex-friend picking on you and getting you in trouble, but there are at least five things everyone can relates to.
B000002UJQ|5.0|My brother has been a fan of Radiohead for several years now, but I didn't start listening to their music until this past summer, pretty much on a whim.  I had no idea what to expect, and figured no band could live up to the critical hype I had heard.<BR>     Nevertheless, Radiohead did just that.  The first CD of theirs that I ever listened to was OK Computer.  Simply put, it blew me away.  The range of emotions, the feeling one can find in the music, the brilliance and complexity--it all hit me like a speeding train the instant the album ended.  Typically, I prefer music from the past (such as Jimi Hendrix or Cream), mainly because today's is so over-produced, commercially tainted, and simplistic; it has no meaning or emotion.  However, Radiohead is just the opposite--a band who sets out with a purpose when they write songs, and accomplish that purpose beautifully.<BR>      In my mind, OK Computer embodies the feeling of the 1990s, of a world overcome with technological advances and mechanical people.  The album conveys a feeling of despair, anger, even cynicism, towards the modern world, but holds out hope for the triumph of man's humanity.  In essence, through the feelings it brings out in the listener, the album seems to attempt to remind people of what makes them human, what separates them from machines.  It is truly brilliant in both its music and lyrics, and provokes thoughts and emotions that no other album can.<BR>     For those who believe Radiohead fans are simply riding the hip bandwagon, I only ask you to be open and fair, and at least listen to this album or perhaps The Bends before criticizing so harshly.  I am only 17 years old, yet this album has still changed not only my outlook on music, but also the ways I think and regard the world.
0393057658|4.0|&quot;Moneyball&quot; is a good read.  Author Michael Lewis explains in an interesting and entertaining manner how the Oakland A's overcome the disadvantage of a low payroll by exploiting inefficiencies in the market for baseball players -- inefficiencies perpetuated by the anti-intellectual tendencies of many baseball men.  My main complaint is that I wish the book was longer.  In interviews Lewis said that he had lots of great conversations with guys like Tim Hudson and J.P. Ricciardi that had to be cut to keep the book short and focused.  At only 288 pages, I read the book in a day and a half, and a lot of the text covered the principles of sabermetrics to help explain how the A's succeed on a low payroll.  This is good information to popularize, but since I already knew that walks are good and bunting is bad, I was hoping for more inside scoop.  Some chapters were excellent -- Oakland's approach to the minor league draft and Chad Bradford's circuitous path to the majors were both very interesting.  Finding out that Oakland GM Billy Beane used to be exactly the type of player he now avoids (great body, terrible hitter) was great.  Seemingly overlooked was the A's great pitching staff, a tribute to the scouting from past years and the coaches who have helped keep the starters healthy.  I was left wanting more information about people in the game who have helped make the A's a surprise success every year.  I'm sure that Lewis had a goal of keeping the book short and punchy, which is probably conducive to selling it to the general population, but as a man with a baseball obsession I feel a little shortchanged.  Lewis had fly-on-the-wall access to one of the most interesting teams in the league and apparently cut out lots of good stuff.  Followup, please!
0393057658|5.0|You don't have to be a baseball fan to have fun reading MONEYBALL<br />by Michael Lewis, but if you are one, you'll find this to one of the best<br />sports books you'll ever come across . . . the subtitle says it all:<br />THE ART OF WINNING AN UNFAIR GAME.<br />It tells the story of how the Oakland Athletics compete successfully<br />with such big market teams as the Yankees and Braves, despite<br />having the second-lowest payroll in baseball . . . they do so by<br />paying attention to statistics that nobody had ever really cared<br />about; e.g., the walk--proving that taking a base on balls can often<br />be the difference between winning and losing a game.<br />I loved the wide range of characters, ranging from the team's<br />general manager (Billy Beane, a flop as a player) to statisticians<br />(such as Bill James) and including such low-paid athletes as Scott<br />Hatteberg and Chad Bradford who became stars when nobody<br />else even knew about them.<br />The writing was most captivating . . . among the passages that<br />caught my attention were the following:<br />* The next year went well enough for him-he was, after all, Billy Beane<br />and by the summer of 1982 he had been promoted to the Mets'<br />Double-A team in Jackson, Mississippi. He played left, Strawberry<br />played right, and the whole team played the field. For a lot of the<br />players it was their first exposure to the Southern female-the most<br />flagrant cheater in the mutual disarmament pact known as the feminism.<br />Lipstick! Hairdos! Submissiveness! Baseball was a game but chasing<br />women was a business, in which Billy Beane was designed to succeed<br />without even trying. Billy had the rap. Billy, said his old teammate<br />J.P. Ricciardi, &quot;could talk a dog off a meat wagon.&quot; Billy was forever<br />having to explain to another teammate of his, Steve Springer, that<br />when you'd just met some girl, what you didn't do was tell her you<br />played pro ball. It wasn't fair to her; you had to give the girl a chance<br />to turn you down. Billy's way of giving her a chance was to tell her that<br />what he did for a living was collect roadkill off local highways. Springer<br />didn't have Billy's awesome God-given ability with women; he thought<br />he needed the Mets to stand a chance; and this need of his led to one<br />of those great little moments that make even the most dismal minor<br />league baseball careers worth remembering. They were leaving one of<br />the local burger joints when two pretty girls called after them, in their<br />fetching drawls: &quot;You boys Yankees?&quot; Springer turned around and<br />said, &quot;No, we're the Mets.&quot;<br />* Fielder is the semi-aptly named Prince Fielder, son of Cecil Fielder,<br />who in 1990 hit fifty-one home runs for the Detroit Tigers, and who by<br />the end of his career could hardly waddle around the bases after one<br />of his mammoth shots into the upper deck, much less maneuver him-<br />self in front of a ground ball. &quot;Cecil Fielder acknowledges a weight<br />of 261,&quot; Bill James once wrote, &quot;leaving unanswered the question of<br />what he might weigh if he put his other foot on the scale.&quot; Cecil Fielder<br />could have swallowed Jeremy Brown whole and had room left for<br />dessert, and the son apparently has an even more troubling weight<br />problem than his father. Here's an astonishing fact: Prince Fielder is<br />too fat even for the Oakland A's. Of no other baseball player in the<br />whole of North America can this be said. Pittaro seems to think that<br />the Detroit Tigers might take Fielder anyway, for sentimental reasons.<br />And if the Tigers take him, they trigger a chain reaction that ends with<br />the Mets getting one of their first six choices.<br />* Having kept the team close enough to hope, Billy could now go out<br />and shop for whatever else he needed to get to the play-offs. When<br />he set off on this shopping spree, he kept in mind five simple rules:<br />1. &quot;No matter how successful you are, change is always good.<br />There can never be a status quo. When you have no money<br />you can't afford long-term solutions, only short-term ones. You<br />have to always be upgrading. Otherwise you're fu*ked.&quot;<br />2. &quot;The day you say you have to do something, you're screwed.<br />Because you are going to make a bad deal. You can always<br />recover from the player you didn't sign. You may never recover<br />from the player you signed at the wrong price.&quot;<br />3. &quot;Know exactly what every player in baseball is worth to you.

The whole cast and crew have excelled themselves and I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes movies that are different from the rest, stand out from the crowd, and make you think!<br />Give it a go, Kristina
0066214122|2.0|A hallmark of Michael Crichton's work over the years has been the issue of technology with unintended consequences thanks to human error. We are not as smart as we think we are, in short. From his first book, \\"Andromeda Strain\\" (which later became a movie of the same name) his literary vision has been of forefront technology coupled with human error bringing about unintended and often disastrous results. In \\"Andromeda Strain,\\" the spacecraft brings to earth space microbes that grow and kill. A concern that NASA took very seriously in the early days of the space program and now ignores as a virtual impossibility.<br />Of course, there was \\"Jurassic Park\\" where some dinosaurs were brought to life in the present, which did not work out that well. \\"Timeline\\" had its own technology issue where some of the characters didn't want to come back and were causing problems in the past. In his recent book, Michael Crichton picks bits and pieces of earlier novels as well as trendy topics such as being a stay at home Dad and corporate malfeasance to whip up a novel that reads almost like a B movie. To say this is a shallow book, at least in regards to characters, gives the concept of \\"shallow\\" a bad name.<br />Jack used to have it all. The super kids, the great cars, the nice house and a really cool job in Silicon Valley, California at MediaTronics. He was having a blast supervising the team and helping to create \\"distributed intelligence\\" programs. (Simplifying greatly, distributed intelligence programs as explained in the book are computer programs that mimic real world animal behavior to make computers work better and smarter. By acting like animals in a herd responding to stimuli, the computer program learns how to make the overall computer system work better.) However, Jack slowly became aware of a gigantic corporate fraud being perpetrated on the shareholders and employees. In doing the right thing, he got himself fired and black balled by his former employers at the age of forty. For the last six months, he has been a stay at home Dad while his wife Julia has been working more and more hours.<br />She is a corporate big shot for Xymos Technology. The company is at the forefront of Nanotechnology by using a different approach than normal. They are combining genetics with some elements of nanotechnolgy and distributed intelligence programs to create a different form of nanotechnolgy. The problem is that the company is desperate for Venture Capitalists and their financing and time is running out.<br />The strain at work is clearly taking a toll on Julia. The strain of Jack being out of work after six months in the Silicon Valley, which is a virtual death sentence in the world of cutting edge computers, is taking a tremendous toll on both of them. With resentment on these issues as well as a host of others, Jack suddenly concludes Julia is having an affair. Not only is she dressing differently and subtly more beautiful despite the long hours she puts in at the office, her whole physical appearance seems to be changing. The way her body looks from head to toe seems to be subtly different and an improvement on her. Her personality seems to be shifting as well.<br />But, his marital problems seem to slide onto the back burner when his old employers want him back temporarily on a consulting basis. It seems that Xymos Technology bought a computer program he designed called PRED/PREY and are having problems with their use of it. Not only did Julia never mention that they had bought it despite being in a position to know, Jack can't figure out what use they would have for it or why it won't work. The program is designed as a model of predator and prey behavior reactions in the wild and while fairly accessible does not really work for what Xymos is working on. But, he needs a job even if it is for a few days and with so many of his former team working for Xymos and acting strange, he takes the job.<br />He is flown out to the fabrication lab forXymos out in the Nevada desert. Once there, he finds out things are far different than he was led to believe. There has been a massive release of nanoparticles from the laboratory. The initial swarm of nanoparticles has apparently given birth to succeeding generational swarms of nanoparticles. Each generation is slowly becoming more complex and sophisticated as they evolve and using the PRED/PREY program, the swarms are learning.

B00005JM0B|1.0|The problem with this movie, in a nutshell?  It adds nothing new to the Terminator storyline.  Unlike T2 (which I felt was a step in the right direction from the original film), this movie does not ask any deep questions about fate, or war, or time travel, or love. It does not give you any hope for the future.  Instead it takes a step backward and travels down the path of typical Hollywood action cinema fare.  Explosions, kissing, screaming, car chases-- they all do nothing but attempt to keep the viewers' attention.<br />Besides that, this new &quot;Terminatrix?&quot;  The one that is supposed to be better than any Terminator ever ever ever?  All she can really do is turn her hands into weapons, and then when a certain weapon is damaged beyond repair, she can no longer use the same weapon.  Huh? Compared to Robert Patrick's T-1000 model from T2, she's a pile of tin cans.  Why didn't the robots send another T-1000 back?<br />Suddenly introducing Claire Danes as a love interest was an interesting trick, completely overdone in Hollywood.  Why does there have to be a love interest in everything?  Why should it be that we know, even as she's cursing John Connor and trying to run away and beating on him, that sure enough, soon enough, they're going to end up as an item?  Like every other character in this film, she ultimately ends up doing nothing.  Nobody does anything to further the plot along.<br />This, see, is what makes this film the poster child for &quot;anti-climax.&quot;  It tells you from the beginning-- this is going to happen.  In the middle of the movie, it says-- oh, wait!  Maybe THIS will happen now instead.  And then at the end, it says, well, see, I TOLD you this was going to happen.<br />And even the stuff that you were told is going to happen isn't visually addressed half the time.  We see machines go nuts for a few minutes, we see Skynet about to be run for the first time, but the rest of the movie is just a couple of people being chased by a Terminator and Ahnold calmly explaining everything that is about to happen.  So seeing this movie just to &quot;see for yourself&quot; what happens is also sort of a waste of time.<br />All that hype just to see a naked female Terminator for about two seconds.  Not only that, but the movie's &quot;it's going to happen no matter what you do&quot; mantra ends up making viewers feel utterly depressed and apathetic.  Just watch T2 again and dream about John Connor's future.  It'll make for a much happier ending.inator and Ahnold calmly explaining everything that is about to happen.

B00005JM4Z|5.0|Wow!  This movie has been getting real mixed reviews .... personally, I am a huge Vin Diesel fan - the man rocks! ... and whilst I love the man, and I am disappointed he wasn't in this sequel, I also thought 2Fast 2Furious was a damn good movie. <br />I thought the storyline was pretty cool actually, people need to take the 'tone' of the movie into account ..... this is about cars, fast cars, hot women, buff men, and essentially tells us what happens to Brian O'Connor (Paul walkers character) after the 'open' ending of the fast and the furious!  Tyrese isn't Vin Diesel but then I don't think they tried to make out that he was! There are absolutely superb action shots and plenty of movement in the plot to make it kick ass.<br />Ummmmmm.... make sure you check out the special features section, cause there is a couple of short films to get you to where we start the movie.<br />I get the feeling that there's gonna be another fast and furious movie coming out, cause I think they're going to get together Vin Diesel, Tyrese, and Paul Walker to finish off the series! That would be most awesome.<br />If you like awesome cars, action, and humour then you won't be disappointed in this movie!  I looooooooove it!  And I'm a chick.<br />To those of you out there who thought it sucked ..... maybe you should watch it again and give it a 'go'.  As in, forget the hype, and just watch the movie.<br />Kristina
B00006J3WH|5.0|I bought it the minute it came out and it is still in regular rotation in my CD player!!  I found it musical more enjoyable for the fact that the talent was unexpected.  Anyone who follows the show/actors new that Anthony Stewart Head(Giles) and James Marsters(Spike) could sing, but who knew about Emma Caulfield(Anya) or Amber Benson(Tara)?  And Joss Whedon turns in a music and lyrics good enough to rival some of the &quot;acclaimed&quot; broadway songwriters!!<br />The CD also includes some additional musical scores written for some of the featured Buffy episodes:  Restless, Hush, The Gift.
0142004235|5.0|John Steinbeck's East of Eden, which was a late, great masterpiece in the author's career, is also one of the greatest American novels of all-time. The book is unique in many ways, with many idiosyncrasies, some of them quite out of Steinbeck's usual style. To start with, many of Steinbeck's works are overtly political; among these are some of his best and best-known works. East of Eden is not among them. As the title suggests, and almost every mention of the book points out, the book is a modern retelling of the Biblical Cain and Abel story. Contrary to what such proclamations -- not to mention Oprah -- might lead one to think, however, this is not a theological, a religious, or a Christian book:  the Cain and Abel allegory is the bare bones that Steinbeck uses to prop up his own visionary, allegorical masterpiece. Aside from its non-political nature, Eden is also distinctive in the Steinbeck canon for other reasons. For one, it features almost no dialect, unlike most of his other famous works; Steinbeck's deceptively simple prose is at its best here, clear and yet philosophical. It also has a much different structure than, say, The Grapes of Wrath:  though it tells the parallel and intersecting stories of two families, it does not feature alternating chapters; it also tends to be quite discursive. It also proves to be quite distinctive for other reasons:  as an allegory, this is not a psychological novel. The actions of the characters in the novel are presented, more or less, per se, without their actions being unduly analyzed and without their inner thoughts being much probed. Their actions are not explained:  they simply ARE. In the case of the perpetually evil Cathy, this can be somewhat frustrating; much of the novel's criticism has focused upon her believability as a character. On that note, it is worthwhile to remember that, in keeping with the book's Biblical bent, she symbolizes Satan. Cathy sees only the bad in people and exploits it for her own purposes.Her downfall comes because she fails to ever see the other side of the coin.<br />And the fact that there are two sides of the coin is the point of the book. The novel is Steinbeck's wake-up call to everyone drifting toward a determinist future. Yes, we have evil coursing through our veins -- but we also have good. Which one we choose to make use of is our own choice -- and no one's but our own. No matter whom our parents are, no matter what our circumstances may be, no matter what others may think of us -- the choice, in the end, resides with us, and us alone. Steinbeck also explores some of his other favorite themes in this monumental work. One of these is the inexplicability of love, symbolized both for Adam's apparently-unfounded yet mysterious love for Cathy and by Cyrus and Adam's preference for one son over another. Another is the consequences of not being loved -- of rejection. Charles and Cal believe that their respective fathers do not love them; they use this thought to justify much of their sometimes questionable behavior. This would seem to be the message of the book for many:  that parents must love their children equally, that rejection and favoritism have, sometimes quite literally, murderous consequences and can lead to cruelty and hatred. With such an interpretation, the doctrine of original sin has its origins not in the Fall of Adam and Eve, but in God's rejection of Cain's gift. Such is the reading on the novel's glossy surface. However, it is well to remember that Cathy IS loved; and yet, not only does she does not love back, she carries out her evil deeds all the more -- not IN SPITE of her being loved, but perhaps even BECAUSE of it. This relates back to Steinbeck's true message:  it the end the choice between good and evil, right and wrong, love and hate -- regardless of rejection, regardless of whether or not we are loved -- is ours, and ours alone.<br />Timshel!
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|Greatest hits is right....but they missed some great songs that weren't hits.  And, as long as they included the obscure b'sides or soundtrack tunes, why didn't they include &quot;In The Sun&quot; from the Princess Diana tribute album?  This is a good disc, but, from my experience, if you have the last 'greatest hits' put out and have all the CD's released after that one - save the money. The only ones who buy these discs anymore are the diehard fans - just something to complete the collection to date.....but not necessary.
B00008PW2D|3.0|It pains me to say this because I am such a fan of the show, but at some point you have to face the facts, and the facts are that SATC is just going downhill.  I write the review after having seen the season premier of the last season last night on HBO (another 8 episode DVD coming up) and because I've followed the show so closely from day one and seen each episode numerous times, I have to say the acting is going downhill as well, not just the stories.  I find myself now just watching it for the sake of seeing the episodes, not like before (especially season 4) where I was anticipating the upcoming episode to see what happened with the SATC girls.<br />But as every show, it must come to an end,  I think it was dragged on too much and hense the bad episodes which seem to be pointless at times, after all how many different types of men can they bag on?<br />I must agree with the other reviewers in saying that I'm waiting for a price drop or a better offer to buy the this seaon, I have all DVD's and usually am the first to buy them but this time dishing out $30 for 8 episodes which I won't even be enjoying over and over again seems a waste.  Too bad, the directors and writers should have ended this great show with a bigger bang, not by disappointing it's fans ...
B0000E64TQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest sounding cd's I have ever heard. It has been beautifully mixed into 5.1 surround sound, and is so clean it is like hearing a brand new recording. Usually the new SACD surround cd's sound good to excellent but this one is the best I have heard (so far). Songs like the title track, Benny And The Jets, Grey Seal, and Jamaica Jerk Off (which is so clear and defined that the Jamaican dialogue is finally heard and adds a freshness that never had been reached on the standard versions of the L.P.). I always loved this album, which by far is Elton's best, but now it is 100 times better. Only one drawback. In the bonus section of songs, you get another version of Candle In The Wind. Now, I have always loved this song, but this is an acoustic version. It has the exact same lead vocal by Elton, and the exact same backing vocals by his band. All of the instrumentation has been taken out and has been replaced by an acoustic guitar. The 1980's version was good, and even the mid 1990's rewritten version which he sang and recorded after Princess Diana's funeral was touching, but enough is enough. Let the original stand on it's own merits. Otherwise a perfect job, and a perfect excuse to get that new SACD player thats out there.
B0000029AL|5.0|On their self titled debut, Aerosmith shows the band's raw, loose and bluesy performance. Alot of their influence came from The Yardbirds era of rock n roll.The album starts out with the insanly catchy blues riffs of &quot;Make It&quot; and &quot;Somebody&quot;. There is the obvious classic &quot;Dream On&quot; which gave them their first taste of rock n roll stardom. &quot;Mama Kin&quot; is one of their absolute early anthems. On &quot;Write Me&quot; Aerosmith show that blues is their major influence. And finally &quot;Walkin The Dog&quot; which has some cool vocals from Steven Tyler. Their debut is highly underrated, and compared to their extremely  recent commercialism of Just Push Play, it sounds very pleasing to hear the bare bone blues and totally unique quality of their early music, and no where is it more apparent than on their debut.
B00001QGPS|5.0|&quot;not a classic&quot; wtf?<br />i shouldn't even have to tell you how great this album is.  make sure to not get the clean version.
B0000029AP|5.0|TOYS IN THE ATTIC works so well beacause the success of the album derives from a combination of an increased sense of songwriting skills and purpose.The heavy petting of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; The awsome title track &quot;Toys In The Attic&quot; and heavy blues influence of &quot;Big Ten Inch Record&quot; all prove that Aerosmith is out to rock your socks off. &quot;Uncle Salty&quot; &quot;Round And Round&quot; &quot;Adam's Apple&quot; are all great obvious classics. Finally my favorite song &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; which was written by Steven Tyler about Joe Perry&quot;s girlfriend is one of their most appealing songs and has one of the best riffs ever by Joe Perry. All in all Toys In The Attic is a must listen for all fans of Aerosmith's signature blues sound.
B00001IVOF|5.0|This is Mobb Deep's second mature album.  It is very suprising to see that they could drop another gangsta classic, especially just a year after The Infamous.  Every track is bangin'.

B0000U0X1G|4.0|Well, ok, so it wan't much for character development or emotion, but to tell you the truth if I wanted character development and emotion, I would have rented The Invisibles (again). When you pick up S.W.A.T., you're looking for action, a few laughs, and the hot guys in body armor. (And girl as well in this case). And S.W.A.T. delivers. The training sequences are spot-on if you like that kind of thing (which I do) and the good old fashioned mayhem is top-notch. There are a few good jokes that kept me laughing. I mean, come on, &quot;Lakers purple&quot;? That's good. And the teeny tiny hint of military humor was great fun for the Navy girl in me. (Even though Colin Farrell is waaaay to young to have retired from the SEALs.) You kind of have to be in the mood for action, humor that's clever in the way that's kind of not, and a non-existent love interest, but if you are, S.W.A.T is perfect.

It's a great book for any occasion, but it's perfect if you want to get acquainted with the author and his dark humor. It's a very easy read, fast paced, and a cleverly written story. Some of his other books that I've really enjoyed were Slaughterhouse- Five, Sirens Of Titan, Mother Night, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, the short stories in Welcome To The Monkeyhouse, and Breakfast Of Champions (don't read Breakfast of Champions until you've read some of the books previously mentioned, or else you probably won't understand where a lot of the material comes from).
B00008PX8P|5.0|For a band for which there is such infamously little video footage, I am amazed at all the camera shots in this work of art. Not for one second does this DVD dissapoint. From the golden riff of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; to the great epic &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; this band more than lives up to its reputation as an incredible live performance. Maybe I'm just biased because I've been forever starving for a Led Zeppelin video, but I think that its safe to say this is the most incredible DVD in the history of the universe.

B00005N919|5.0|Paul Verhoeven and Joe Eszterhas open their film with the ultimate oxymoron of love and death: the moment of orgasm coincides with the moment of greatest agony and death. Never before has a film character been killed in the throes of orgasm. Never before has such a wildly creative and controversial opening polarized audience opinion from scene one. Never before has orgasm on film achieved such a scary, cynical, darkly humorous edge with each counter-penetration of the murder weapon. The very concept of doing away with a victim in this way in the first minutes of the film demonstrates the creators' genius -- and their \\"poor\\" taste.<br /><br />But this is only the beginning of a delightfully ironic, even amusing, dance between life and death that forms the twists and turns of Basic Instinct.<br /><br />Aside from analyzing a film from the infantile and simple-minded level of sex and violence, a great film achieves emotional intensity also with it's carefully photographed and edited \\"looks\\", scenes in which the characters glance at each other in fits of non-verbal communication - and Basic Instinct scores 200 percent in this department. Achieved by Verhoeven, cinematographer Jan De Bont, and the cast itself, the \\"looks\\" achieve a particularly fine edge when Curran and Gus first encounter Roxy in the \\"his and hers Picassos\\" scene in the foyer, and then later Verhoeven and cast up the ante again in the oceanside scene on the deck in which Curran, Gus, and Trammell first encounter each other. The cutting and film score in this area are so beautiful it hurts. This is surely Jerry Goldsmith's finest score, whose power throughout the production is inestimable.<br /><br />Non-verbal looks are key, and looks mixed with Joe Eszterhas' now-famous dialogue make Basic Instinct a film so coherent and so vital, so crackling with delicious character friction, that Basic Instinct is absolutely perfect - at least up until the violent sex scene between Curran and his psychotherapist, which I thought was unnecessary, but which adds a needed touch of lunacy to Curran's and Garner's relationship. The fact that this relationship is openly discussed in the department provides the final touch of contradiction and astringency.<br /><br />A great film stimulates all parts of the mind simultaneously, from the most intellectual to the most primal, and Basic Instinct covers the entire spectrum, providing doses of gore, emotionally satisfying character interaction, and intellectually stimulating plot.<br /><br />Basic Instinct is chock full of classic and memorable scenes, but most of the sex and violence scenes are definitely off the list. Verhoeven has to do it tastefully and artfully, of course. No missteps here. But who cares how well they can make love or stab each other? It's the stuff in between the violence, the fantastic interactions and pithy dialogue of one of the best film casts ever assembled, that makes Basic Instinct so great. Particularly notable and satisfying is the scene with Dr. Lamott, Dr. Garner and the entire police staff, which hones in on the ambiguity and insanity of the film's basic themes, with brilliant support again from Goldsmith's underscore.<br /><br />Basic Instinct is the peak of Michael Douglas' career - and Sharon Stone's, for that matter. Aside from Douglas' artfully chiseled expressions, let's not forget that fabulous voice. Douglas is simply incredible, and I have never enjoyed so much seeing a lead character attacked by everyone else in the cast, especially his own people.<br /><br />Note a particularly underrated performance by Denis Arndt as Lieutenant Walker, Curran's immediate supervisor, who provides a deliciously acrid and sardonic non-supportiveness for Curran's ongoing investigation.<br /><br />If characters like Curran and Walker irritate, then Stone as Trammell is the ultimate lubricant, nothing sticks to her, she can easily wriggle out of any situation. Basic Instinct dares to portray an invincible murdererwith no guilt, no weaknesses, who as antagonist overcomes Curran by seduction.<br /><br />I would like to finally touch upon Jan De Bont's gorgeous, smooth camera moves, which used in conjunction with long, unbroken, multi-character dialogue shots loaded with camera movement, elevate the European style and make this one of the most visually pleasurable films to watch ever made, just in terms of pure camera movement. The interplay of camera and actors is electrifying in it's vitality. I really enjoyed verhoeven's and De Bont's commentary track on the Blu Ray.<br /><br />In it's craft alone, Basic Instinct goes far beyond the average thriller to become the ultimate modern whodunit against which all others must be measured. This film will far outlast it's critics - Verhoeven's best film by far.n by seduction.

There are little clues laced throughout each episode that hint of a larger universe  through which Firefly travels.  Enjoy and hopefully someone will decide to start the series again!
B0000DJZA0|4.0|Coldplay has only put out two albums-so why are they issuing a \\"live\\" record?  I have to admit I found myself wondering this very thing.  I resisted buying this CD for a few weeks.  Then in a moment of weakness, I ended up taking it home when I could not find another CD I was looking for.  Then after ignoring it on my bedroom dresser for a while I finally put it on.  I must admit I have been listening to it almost everyday since.<br />Critics have been down on Coldplay because they think we really should be listening to Radiohead instead-a band Coldplay resembles in some ways.  They also make much of what a pain the lead singer is in person.  It seems the lead singer also knocked up and married a well-liked movie star.<br />I don't care about any of that.  I don't know anything about the personal lives of the members of Coldplay.  They could be good guys or axe murders for all I know.  But the music is excellent.<br />The first song, \\"Politik\\", is a perfect example.  At first, it just sounds like someone simply pounding on the keyboard.  But as the music goes along, the simplicity slowly reveals itself as a more complex and compelling song.  It sets you up and then draws you in.  I must confess that even when I read the lyrics I am not sure what the singer is talking about.  The sounds are beautiful and they rock.<br />As a live album, the production is very well done.  Even having heard these songs in their original form on Coldplay's first two CDs, there is something magnetic about their presentation here.<br />This CD also comes with a DVD of the performances in concert.  The DVD contains all the songs on the CD plus five more.  It is good to have the extra music, but the visual record doesn't really add anything.  The DVD also includes a 40 minutes documentary of the tour.  Some people like these things-I can't say I found it all that interesting.<br />But with such a great CD these negatives can safely be dismissed.  If you already have the first two Coldplay CDs you won't regret getting this one.  If you never cared for Coldplay in the past, this CD may well turn you around.CDs you won't regret getting this one.  If you never cared for Coldplay in the past, this CD may well turn you around.

B000002IAS|4.0|As much as we share with each other, there are just some things we Yanks and them Brits just don't see eye to eye.  As any peek into any English music magazine will show, both Americans and English have enthusiasms neither understands in each other.  The English have never understood The Allman Brothers Band.  As much as they love country music, soul music and Elvis, for some reason our brothers and sisters in the \\"old country\\" never understood the appeal of \\"Southern Rock\\"-especially the \\"boogie\\" school.<br />For all its faults, most Americans recognized the fevered swamps of Southern Rock as a part of the American musical landscape.  It may not be to your taste; but in was American all right.  Around 1970, the Allman Brothers and the company of bands that followed took America by storm.  When Eric Clapton jumped right in with Delaney & Bonnie, several other British rockers dove into the pool with him.  It baffled most of his countrymen, but we loved Clapton all the more for it.  Make no mistake:  it's for Clapton that most of us will pick up this CD.<br />This CD is just plain fun.  As it goes, I think only one song, \\"Coming Home\\", actually got any airplay.  But the album was on turntables everywhere in 1970-1971.  The appeal was the loose and joyous atmosphere of several excellent musicians coming together to play and have fun.<br />Any album which ends with Eric Clapton easing into a Little Richard medley has a lot going for it.
0385504209|5.0|I heard about this book and the stir it is causing on my way to work one day.  Hype does nothing for me, but when I received a gift certificate for Christmas, I looked into it.  What intrigued me most was the setting.  France and the Louvre!  What could be better?<br />Not a normal reader of mysteries or thrillers, The DaVinci Code was definitely worthwhile.  It is very well written and seems thoroughly researched.  After reading it I completely understand the stir it is causing among the Catholic/religious set.  It has definitely caused some interesting conversations in my group.  While you read you have to force yourself to remember that it is a novel -- in other words fiction.  The best fiction is always based on facts, right?  It really does challenge you to think about your beliefs.  Do you believe in the story or the Dogma?  Therein lies the rub!<br />Mr. Brown definitely leads you on a dance though France and London.  By the time I was half way through the book I was already wondering where I could get my hands on some of his reference materials.  I did find the ending somewhat uneventful, but I really enjoyed the ride.  What fun!  Enjoy!
B00006YXE4|4.0|Eric Clapton has said that he is finished with touring and so this CD set represents a souvenir of that last go around.  Hence, it is a little surprising that this collection gathered only a tepid reception when it was released.  Then again, most of Clapton's output has been greeted with lukewarm praise since the release of Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs.  Clapton has not (and perhaps could not) achieved that level of fire and intensity since Derek And The Dominos.  Many haven't forgiven him for it.<br />Instead, Clapton has taken a more laid back approach to his music.  Indeed, most reports I've heard make much of how simple and stripped down Clapton's performances were during this last tour.  And that is how this CD first opens.  \\"Key To The Highway\\" has been a staple of Clapton's concerts for more than thirty years; but here he plays it as an acoustic.  Most of the first disc is this \\"unplugged\\" style which explains in part most critics under whelming reaction.  It also doesn't help that the second cut is \\"Reptile\\"-a sort of \\"soft jazzy\\" instrumental.  Clapton then proceeds to give a small selection of his more popular repertoire such as \\"Tears In Heaven\\", \\"Change The World\\", And \\"My Father's Eyes\\".  It is not until the seventh cut (\\"My Father's Eyes\\") than Clapton puts down the acoustic and plays the electric.  It is here things begin to pick up.  Clapton plays the acoustic well; but the audience clearly gets kicked up several notches when he takes command of the instrument he has built his career upon.<br />Be that as it may, the CD doesn't flex into overdrive until the band flies into \\"Badge\\" on disc two.  What follows is my favorite section.  This consists of confident and extended versions of \\"Badge\\", \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\", \\"Cocaine\\", \\"Layla\\" and \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\".  This section is so enjoyable that whatever deflects preceded before are forgiven.  The CD ends with a surprising and nostalgic version of \\"Over The Rainbow\\".  If I were to choose a nod toward the Great American Songbook, somehow I don't think I would pick a Judy Garland tune.  Clapton is clearly taking some stock of his life and his public carrier.  Friends are gone and the torch is being passed.  Perhaps Clapton is ending this part of his life by saluting the generation he took his own torch from.  In any event it is an exceptional moment.<br />The version of this CD I purchased also has a companion DVD.  It has the same playlist as the CD-except it also includes a chance for Billy Preston to romance the audience with \\"Will It Go Round In Circles\\".  DVD presentations don't usually do much for me; but I must admit I enjoyed this one.  Viewing the DVD changed some of my misgivings about this \\"concert\\".<br />If you are new to Clapton this seems to me to be an awful lot to wade through.  There are at least six other Clapton CDs I would advise you to get before venturing onto this one.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|I must say I love this DVD! I have seen several tribute concerts (of both people whom are living or have passed on) where some of the performers are there because of a record company contract, or they are a fan of the person, or they have done a cover etc.  In this case, not only did those people on the stage work with the late George Harrison, they were also very much part of his life in one way or another. It was a labor of love for sure, and certainly showed how much of an impact this man not only had on the lives and music of the people performing, but on music in general.  He never got enough credit in my eyes for his contributions to music.  Often shadowed by the whole Lennon/McCartney mystical thing...depending on how mystical you thought that was.  Performances that hit me the most were &quot;Horse to Water&quot; (can that gal sing or what!) Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers &quot;I Need You&quot;, Billy Preston's knock out version of &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot;  &quot;Beware of the Darkness&quot; &quot;The Inner Light&quot;&quot;While my guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;Arpan&quot; knocked my socks off! What a fantastic piece by Ravi Shankar, conducted by his very talented daughter.  I loved how up and flamboyant Ringo was, he was being well, Ringo.  Why would you expect him to be sad in such a celebration, though I am sure he missed his friend.  I too was impressed with Joe Brown, though I never heard of him really much before.   In the concert portion, you see the whole original lay out of the concert, starting with the Indian portion, then a nice break with the Monty Python tribute, then the band.  As for several previous reviewers on Paul McCartney's need to be the center of attention.  Perhaps this is why he was regulated towards the end of the show? Because the concert was not about him? The end time was a lot about Paul being all over.  I do think he was kind of being Paul by butting in about what Olivia said back stage, but then again, it was kindof true and nice to know. I don't think he was being mean about it.  In general, I am not a big Paul fan, actually I don't care for most of his solo music, but well, I don't think he was  trying to be vicious or anything, actually he seemed kind of humble for Paul.  The movie portion, you have to remember it's a documentary as well as showing some performances.  I think it is fantastic to have both available on this DVD.  This is certainly going to be watched over and over and over again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw this series on the air. Several friends urged me to purchase the box set, however, and I did so on a whim. I have rarely been as impressed with any television series as I am with Firefly.<br />I echo the sentiments of so many other reviewers- while the space-western fusion is fascinating, and the plots intriguing, characterization, characterization, characterization is what makes this series truly great. The dialogue is just fabulous, and reverberates with a sharpness and humor that really surprised me. <br />We grow to care about each one of these people within an amazingly short period of time. There is not a single superficial character (my particular favorites are Wash, the goofy-but-skilled pilot, and Shepherd Book, the preacher-with-a-mysterious past), and the interpersonal dynamics are highly textured and fascinating. Everyone rings true, and nobody is static. We see growth in every character. Even Jayne (the token hard-nosed mercenary) develops (or reveals) unsuspected depths before the end.  <br />As a Christian, I'm fascinated with the portrayal of faith on the fringes. I was also intrigued by the post-civil war aspect of the series. In a world in which everything under the sun has been done before, defeated Confederate soldiers in space was a new one on me.<br />I'm thrilled that a movie may be on the horizon. Every DVD set sold increases the chances of that coming to pass, so buy one. You won't regret it.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|What an incredible comeback....!  I love the album so much, it's stuck in my cd changer on repeat. Whitney sings her heart out and will definitely silence the critics.  It's in her to be the DIVA she is, and I am so proud of her for not going on an all promotion blitz. The album will grow wings and become one of the greatest Christmas/Holiday CD's of all time.<br />O' Holy Night is moving!<BR>Deck the Halls is soulful<BR>Little Drummer Boy is sweet and tender with littl Bobbi K.<BR>The Christmas Song reminds me of Nat King Cole.<br />Sorry folks, but Miss Houston is like silk on every note and she makes the word reindeer sound like sweet angels.<br />Whitney is indeed in a class by herself, despite the drama. She is a beautiful, talented woman who could care less what the world thinks of her because she is singing for her Lord, not ours. <br />Joy in Boston, MA
B00006BTCA|3.0|This album is good. Don't get me wrong. I like it. The thing I don't like is people comparing it to Echo and the Bunnymen. You'd think they never heard either band. These guys sound like The Strokes playing Joy Division songs. It's that simple. It's good stuff, even better when you're drunk and it's playing behind the voices of some friends at a party... but it's not really deserving of any critical acclaim.
B00005JMGL|5.0|The last time J. M. Barrie's infamous creation hit the big screen was in the lacklustre \\"Return to Neverland\\", the latest in a long line of pitiful animated sequels that the Disney Company have been mechanically churning out. The time before that was in Steven Spielberg's critically ill-received \\"Hook\\". With these two movies as a somewhat stale background for writer/director P. J. Hogan's attempt to recreate the fairytale, it was not surprising if audiences at large were somewhat cynical.<br />But children's literature translated onto the big screen is always successful when it is done faithfully and respectfully, and that is precisely what Hogan and his team have done. For the first time ever (if you can believe it) a young boy plays the part of the Boy Who Never Grew Up: Jeremy Sumpter, complete with bare feet, pan pipes and captivating smile. Following in the pantomime tradition, Jason Issacs plays both George Darling and Captain Hook, meek and clumsy in one role, charismatic and brutal in the next. Ultimately a figure to be pitied, Hook is more aware of his dependence on Pan than he lets on, and the two are more similar than either would like to admit.<br />Olivia Williams plays the beautiful and graceful Mrs Darling, whilst Richard Briers makes a humorous Smee, often making side-comments directly to the audience. John, Michael and the Lost Boys are played by some wonderful child actors, in particular Slightly (Theodore Chester) who creates most of the laughs for the movie: \\"Okay boys, look lovable.\\" Ludivine Sagnier takes on the rather difficult role of Tinkerbell. The role means she has to rely solely on exaggerated facial expressions to present Tink's \\"one emotion at a time\\", though I was disappointed in the failure of creating the bond between Peter and Tinkerbell, which somewhat lessens the impact of her later sacrifice.<br />The real star of the story however belongs to Wendy, and new-comer Rachel Hurd-Wood breaths her to life. Gone is the prissy Wendy of the Disney productions, thankfully replaced by a young woman who is both mischievous and wise, playful and sensual, with a hidden kiss in the corner of her mouth. She is a remarkable find, and shows considerable talent for one who has no previous experience.<br />There are a few changes to the original story (mostly surrounding the considerably heightened romantic inclinations between Wendy and Peter), but they are sparse. The inclusion of Aunt Millicent was something that intially didn't appeal to me, but luckily she is not portrayed as a grumpy, aristocratic matriarch, but a somewhat befuddled, though loving aunt. And let's face it, Lynn Redgrave never fails to deliver a performance. The changes are slight and understandable, but those kept true are breathtaking. My main concern was that of Tinkerbell's cure, would could come across as cringe-worthy if done badly, but just try to refrain from smiling when Peter, then Wendy, then the Lost Boys, then the children of London begin to chant: \\"I do believe in fairies! I do! I do!\\" (and I was especially glad to see adults included in this declaration - I'm certainly one of them!)<br />The visual creation of Neverland is something I can't really comment on, as it is entirely a matter of opinion - let's just say it's bright, vibrant and doesn't hesitate to bend the rules of reality. I thought it was beautiful, but only wish I had more time to enjoy it, as sequences of potential awe (such as flying through London and the fairy-covered pirate ship) flashed by too quickly to really soak in.<br />There is one fault (if you can even call it that) in the telling of the story, and as it's playing on my mind, you'll have to bear with me in sorting it out. By creating a mutual attraction between Peter and Wendy (whereas in the book he called her \\"Mother\\" like the Lost Boys), the screenwriters begin a personal development in Peter that is not brought to a conclusion that makes sense. Throughout the story, Peter shows signs of perhaps wanting to leave Neverland: he is horrified at the thought Wendy might marry someone else, it is discovered he loves Wendy's stories because they all end in love, her \\"thimble\\" saves his very life, and he even admits to himself at the conclusion - \\"to live would be an awfully big adventure\\". And yet, he still returns to Neverland. It would seem all that Wendy has shown him, all that he has discovered about himself comes to nothing, and there is no doubt in audience's minds that the choice he made was the wrong one.<br />But of course the alternative was that Peter actually *does* grow up, and that defeats the very purpose of Barrie's book. It was a no-win situation for the screenwriters: they could either stay true to the novel, or continue with their own creation and complete Peter's self-awareness. They choose the former, making the conclusion not just bittersweet, but truly heartbreaking.<br />There is no real right or wrong answer to my comments, its just something I wanted to bring up for people to think about. Ultimately, the story of Peter Pan is as Hook says: a tragedy - a boy is trapped in youth without any experiences of love or marriage or fatherhood. Whilst Wendy will one day embark on what her Aunt Millicent called \\"the greatest adventure of all\\", Peter remains a boy that cannot give her what she seeks. Only a hidden kiss connects these two soulmates as a testimony to what might have been.ps wanting to leave Neverland: he is horrified at the thought Wendy might marry someone else, it is discovered he loves Wendy's stories because they all end in love, her \\"thimble\\" saves his very life, and he even admits to himself at the conclusion - \\"to live would be an awfully big adventure\\".

B0000C9ZLD|3.0|I think this is a good record and much better than any other main stream crap on FM radio. The first track &quot;12:51&quot; is pretty lame. It's a poor excuse of a Cars' rip off and sounds even more so like some of their lesser known NY contemporaries.<BR>The second track &quot;reptilia&quot; is where it kicks in. Valensi &amp; Hammond shine on this tune. The rest of the record flows pretty well with notable homage's throughout. Seems like these guys could do whatever they want and people would buy into it regardless. They could release an album of Buddhist chants and it would be hailed. In between dating super models, actresses, gracing every magazine cover in the world and vacationing in Hawaii they managed to write a few new tunes that are actually pretty good.<BR>Worth buying used but not at the $17 club price.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|The setlist and the music execution of this album is great. However the sound quality is awful. This sounds like an amatuer bootleg recorded with beginner's equipment. I find it hard to beleive that an ablum of this quality made it out of the QA department.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I tried to like the Matrix Reloaded and watched it twice just to make sure that I wasn't buying into the hype.  Well, I didn't buy into the hype.  This movie is really mediocre compared to the first chapter which was in a word, outstanding.<br />Reloaded has extremely weak writing and I was very surprised that all the sets looked, well, like sets!  They looked really cheap, especially the mansion scene.  I kept thinking about the cost that you know was spent, but somehow just didn't come across as - real.  This applies to the 'holes' in the skin.  They looked so bad, like something a kid added to Trinity and Neo's arms with crazy glue.<br />Lastly, the writing.  This story had elements that could have really risen to the occasion but instead fell flat.  The character of Link was so annoying.  He NEVER gave straight answers, unlike his predecessor who was quick, precise and paid attention.  This guy was like, \\"just follow the sirens\\", \\"oopse, those twin things are after Morpheus and Trinity.\\"  No wonder Morpheus told him to trust him and at one point even asked, \\"Are you paying attention Link?\\"  The guy was a dud as well as this film.  <br />Unfortunately this chapter is just a mere shadow of the original.  This is just another sequal that didn't live up to its predecessor.
B0000U0X1G|3.0|Best:<br />1) You get to see authentic SWAT tactics as the action scenes were supervised by current and retired team members.<BR>2) The action scenes were the most extreme examples of police life and the big visuals were pretty well done.<BR>3) Those who like character development might like the soap opera nature of the actor's interplay.<BR>4) There's a host of special features including 4 short documentaries and 2 commentary tracks.<br />Worst:<br />1) You have to REALLY love cops to love this movie because you're immersed in police life from beginning to end.<BR>2) The non-action scenes often came across as dorky and a little too much like the 1970's TV series.<BR>3) Those who want lots of action may be disappointed with the first half of the movie.<BR>4) The major characters sometimes acted too much like testosterone-soaked studs (even Michelle Rodriguez).<BR>5) The hip-hop soundtrack was loud and intrusive at the wrong times.<br />Recommendation:<br />If you prefer real grit in your police dramas, this one may be too much talk and too little action for you. It's likable but not all that memorable (except for the cool airplane landing on the bridge scene). The generous amount of special features is what tips the balance for me to recommend this one.

0451167716|5.0|The Godfather is one of the great novels of the twentieth century and constitutes the defining story of organized crime in America.  Oh, other novels have and will be written on this subject, some of them very good indeed.  But The Godfather stands alone, far above all others of the genre.  This is a classic and great novel.  Seven stars at least.<br />This is the story of Don Vito Corleone, whose Sicilian father (family name of Andolini) is murdered by the local Mafia Don in Corleone, Sicily.  Relatives spirit young Vito away to America, for otherwise he too will be murdered to prevent the otherwise certain day when he will come for revenge.  Vito comes to America and builds an empire of organized crime.<br />The triumph of this novel is that it explains the Mafia as the Mafia sees itself.  As Vito's son Michael explains, Vito (known to friends and associates as The Godfather, a traditional term of respect) sees himself as the equal of presidents, senators, and governors of the states, and sees no reason to be &quot;a fool&quot; or to accept the rules of society that condemn others to (what he perceives as) lives of failure and subordination.  Accordingly, Don Corleone rejects the rules of society, the fact that governments restrict the use of violence to themselves, and builds his own society--La Cosa Nostra (&quot;our world&quot;).  Within the narrow limits of this world he is more powerful than the government.<br />The book can be criticized for somewhat glorifying the underworld, but in reality by the time the reader completes the novel the corruption, violence, and destructiveness of organized crime are depressingly obvious.<br />The other amazing thing about this novel is Puzo's ability to tell an extraordinarily complex story involving many characters in a coherent fashion that never loses the reader with too much detail.  By the time I finished the novel I felt that I knew Tom Hagan, Michael and Sonny Corleone, the Don himself, Johnnie Fontane, and a whole host of other characters.  Most novels founder in confusion when they try to present so many characters and so many interconnected sub-plots.  Not here.  Puzo tells his story with superb prose and flawless coherence.  From a craftsmanship standpoint, this is precisely the type of novel that all novelists aspire to write.  Few succeed.  Puzo succeeds brilliantly.<br />Before reading this novel I had never understood the role of the Mafia in American (or Sicilian!) society, and how complicity by the authorities is what really allow it to function.  Puzo did understand these things, and the novel explains with insight and clarity.<br />This novel stands head-and-shoulders above most other American novels of the Twentieth Century, and is the defining novel about organized crime in America.ole host of other characters.

0385504209|1.0|O, Draconian Devil, why on earth did I read this book? I am not a cryptographer or world-famous symbologist, but I figured out the story's infantile puzzles long before the so-called experts. I also figured out why it's a page turner--you can't wait to turn the page to see whether the writing will improve. Really, the whole thing sounds like the Hardy Boys and the Keystone Copts, or Abbott and Costello Meet a Big Dumb Albino.<br />As for the historical accuracy, who cares? The book is achingly dull and predictable. Try Eco or Perez-Reverte if you want to experience a more literary thrill ride. Take Dorothy Parker's sentiments to heart: &quot;This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.&quot;

It's quite an investment of time, but in my opinion, well worth it.<br />Enjoy...
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I have watched my copy of the movie over and over again and now I am unable to separate myself from my headphones. This is by far one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard!<br />There are so many highlights from this soundtrack it's hard to just pick a few, but I'm gonna have to go with &quot;Skull and Crossbones&quot;, &quot;Barbossa is Hungry&quot;, &quot;He's a Pirate&quot; and my favorite, &quot;The Medallian Calls&quot; (Jack Sparrow's trademark entrance).<br />I'm impressed at the effort it has undoubtedly taken to compile &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. The amazing musical heights reaced here I have only found elsewhere in one place: &quot;The Lord Of the Rings&quot; This is my first hearing of Klaus Baldet, and I hope it isn't the last.
0060512806|5.0|...and that's a high compliment considering how exceptional a writer he is.<br />I was a bit put off at first by the size of this 1,000 some odd page anchor of a book, but was immediately hooked by N.S.'s creative, humorous style, and almost unmatched knack for relating modern day technology to and it's significance to \\"common folk\\" like me.<br />This is a real fun and worthwhile read.<br />The story itself is very interesting and I feel smarter having read it, however, what really appealed to me is how \\"cool\\" this book is; data havens, cryptology, cypher code, who would have thought you could think these things (and the people who are involved with them) \\"cool\\"...but you will.<br />Enjoy...
B0000DZEA1|4.0|I had high expectations for this soundtrack, and at first I was rather disappointed in what I heard. Most of the songs seemed almost the same, soft and wandering.<br />However, I soon discarded that and came to my senses. To fully enjoy the music of Return of the King one must listen to the entire disc together. This helped me get the feel of what seemed to be missing.<br />Overall, while I enjoyed the soundtrack, I believe the first two sounded much more wholesome, more rich with a varied sound to it. <br />There were less loud, rousing pieces to this edition, the only real ones being &quot;Minas Tirith&quot; and &quot;The Pelennor Fields&quot;.<br />The real highlight of the CD was the final track &quot;Into the West&quot;, sung by Annie Lennox. It makes up for all the shortcomings I think lay in this album and almost sinlge-handedly proves the CD's worth. It is an incredible song incorporating text from the novel and manages to sound both sad and joyful at the same time. If Howard Shore and Annie Lennox are not awarded at the Academy Awards this year for their efforts, then there is no justice left in this world.
B000007SPT|3.0|In the 80s, the 4AD label specialized in bands that played moody, borderline mopey music.  In 1984, head man Ivo Watts-Russell got many 4AD artists together to record this album.  Most of the tracks include members of different bands playing together.  Several cuts are cover tunes.  I'm not as blown away by it as most of the previous reviewers (I wouldn't trade any of my Cocteau albums except &quot;Garlands&quot; for it), but it's a good album that should appeal to fans of the label's bands.  The CD includes members of Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance, Cindytalk, Colourbox, The Wolfgang Press, Xmal Deutschland, and Modern English, along with a lead vocal by Howard Devoto on a cover of Alex Chilton's &quot;Holocaust&quot;.  This is mood music, music to veg out to at night.<br />The definite highlight is a cover of Tim Buckley's &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; by Cocteau Twins Elizebeth Fraser and Robin Guthrie.  Other highlights are Fraser singing Roy Harper's &quot;Another Day&quot;, Modern English's Robbie Grey singing &quot;Not Me&quot;, and instrumentals &quot;Fyt&quot; and &quot;The Last Ray&quot;.  I prefer the 4AD compilation &quot;Lonely Is an Eyesore&quot;, but I still like this enough to have bought it once on LP and again on CD.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|\\"In The Zone\\" is one of the best Pop albums I have ever heard. There is only one bubble gum song which is the horrible \\"Brave new girl\\" (I wish she would have left it out). The first single is the amazing \\"Me Against The Music\\", a great Club hit which doesn't need Madonna at all, maybe it could have been better without her. Don't get me wrong, I'm a die hard Madonna worshipper, I just think that Britney was enough to make this a great song. Then we have \\"I Got That Boom Boom\\" which is an hip hop influenced track featuring Ying Yang Twins, two annoying rappers who scream all the time but the song still sounds nice and could work very well in Clubs. \\"Showdown\\" is the first sexual song on the record but it's tastefully done and is great to get you in a sexy mood. \\"Breathe on me\\" sounds like a Kylie Minogue song but it's something that Kylie could never do, she just doesn't have Britney's charisma when it comes to be sexy but classy. \\"Early morning\\" is surprisingly amazing, this is something that you wouldn't expect from Britney and I'm glad she's being so innovative. \\"Toxic\\" is infectious and extremely original, the catchiest song she's ever done. \\"Outrageous\\" is the R.Kelly produced track, with a repetitive chorus which sticks in your head. The infamous \\"Touch of my hand\\" is excellent, it could have been sexually explicit but Britney chose to talk about this subject in a quite classy way. \\"The hook up\\" is unexpectedly amazing, a dancehall influenced party song. \\"Shadow\\" is the first ballad on the album, it has the potential to be a great hit but maybe she could have sung a little more. \\"Everytime\\" is the second ballad and the last song on the album, a sincere and heartfelt track which is probably about her break up with Justin Timberlake.<br />I used to think that Britney would have never been more than a teen idol but this album proves that with the right producers, she can really make great music and I think that everyone should give her a chance. If you are open minded and willing to forget about her image, you won't be disappointed by this album.

B00004Y7SF|3.0|I'm not really a fan of Christmas' albums but I had to buy this one since I'm a die hard fan of Christina Aguilera and I wasn't really disappointed. If you expect something boring and religious then you're wrong, there are a few party Christmas tracks and a few tracks where Christina can really show her wonderful vocal range. But it could have been better, there are a few fillers and I always try to avoid albums with fillers. Not disappointing but not impressing.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is great but... AMC had killed it by playing it all the time. Its gotten to the point where I know almost every line. Surprisingly I wouldn't recommend buying it because they play it every night.<br />This movie is about two convicts in a jail that is run by a crooked warden and many views on life through the eyes of two convicts. It looks at life many different ways, it talks about life, death, hope and friends. And about Jailtime of course.<br />This movie deserved the awards it got because it is soooo good, if you like this movie watch:<BR>Antwone Fisher<BR>Girl Interrupted<BR>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
B00004SCX6|2.0|Besides the 5 singles, there are a few good songs. &quot;Don't go knocking on my door&quot; is an okay R&amp;B influenced track, &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is not as bad as some people say, it's a funny and danceable cover and I really like it. &quot;What you see is what you get&quot; is another okay Pop track and even though &quot;Where are you now&quot; is a little too melodramatic, it's another track which I don't hate. But even though there are a few songs which I like, &quot;Oops! I did it again&quot; remains a very bad pop album.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I have been to 2 of their concerts before and this was just like them.  It is awesome to have them on DVD and be able to watch it any time that I want.  If you know someone you want to get a gift for then gert them this... it is the BEST gift that I have ever received.  It is a must buy.
B00005OM4N|3.0|While \\"Baby one more time\\" and \\"Oops! I did it again\\" were only products which had no substance, this album is actually an improvement and it has a few great songs. The first single \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" is an amazing R&B/Hip-Hop Club hit, it's sexy and danceable, just like a few other songs. But there are still too many bubble gum tracks, like the horrible \\"Anticipating\\" (one of her worst songs ever).
0385474547|5.0|Things Fall Apart is Achebe's unsentimental, beautifully-rendered portrait of the Igbo people. In clean, spare prose he tells the story of Okonkwo and his family and at the same time, he shows that pre-colonial Igbo land (and by extension pre-colonial sub-Saharan Africa) was not a place filled with the jabbering savages that Conrad depicts in 'Heart of Darkness' who seem to have nothing better to do than to appear in scary dark groups and scare white men. <br />Every page of this book is alive with authenticity. The plot is elliptical, going round and round, touching different characters, and in this way Achebe pays tribute to the different cultural norms of the Igbo -- including the not-so-pleasant ones -- while at the same time painting a real portrait of a community that eventually falls apart as a result of British colonialism.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|My daughter recently turned 11 years old and has always loved Britney Spears.  So when she asked for the new Britney Spears cd \\"in the zone\\" I didn't think much of it.  Until I listened to the clips on amazon and decided that the lyrics werent approprate for my daughter.  When I went to ask my daughter for her Britney Spears cd she said that she would gladly give it to me because she didn't like the type of songs that were on the cd.  I personally felt that Britney was trying too hard to be like alot of Madonna and came off too provocative. I happen to like alot of Madonnas music.  Its one thing to have a few songs but when every song on the disk comes off about sex you have surpassed even Madonna, hope she likes all her songs played at the \\"gentlemens clubs\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There is no television-produced sci-fi that can come close to the pathos, humour and just overall awesometasticness (had to make up my own word to show just how cool) of this show.<br />Buy it and enjoy, you can thank me later.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is just the funnest film to watch. It has a very different perspective than most other war movies. It is very dramatic and sad at some times. Intense and gruesome at other times. Awesome explosions and gunfire. It couldn't be more real. By watching a preview on tv, I thought it would be a really boring movie, but the preview, i guess, doen't describe the film very good. so don't be mislead by the previews. I actually understood what was going on. Like the plans they had and where everyone was. You got to see some of the enemies point of veiw also. The characters were very real and was amazing what they did. You got to see the wives reactions to their husbands dying and that was sad. Very good ending. I couldn't belive this movie was set in the 60's. Great movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is just plain the best television show ever aired.  It's not a western, it's not sci-fi, it's not a drama, it's not a comedy.  It has elements of all of those, and more, but it is MORE, and therefore, hard to explain.<br />So I ask you this - if you don't have this, if you never saw the series while it was on TV (or didn't like it when you did): beg, borrow or steal the PREMIERE (not the one called &quot;The Train Job&quot; - the two hour premiere that got aired as the last show), and WATCH IT.  I've had ten friends watch the premiere who either did not watch the show, or did and did not really care for it, and they are all now addicted to the show.<br />If you think that is unfair since the show will never have any more episodes, I'll let you in on a not-so-secret: there is a script being written for a movie.  It'll be made if the DVD sells well enough.  And if the movie sells well enough?  Well, maybe they'll make a TV show out of it!<br />WATCH THIS SHOW!
B000096I9G|5.0|I'm sure many fans have been asking for an official live recording in dvd format from the cure, and this release fills all their (and my own) expectations. Rob himself has prepared this wonderful document of live cure and standout albums performed live, perfectly by the current lineup. <br />There's very few complaints as it's a wonderfully done dvd release. Only complaint i have is about the PCM soundtrack that has too much echo on it at times and the vocals sound quite bad at few points. However, one can skip to the 5.1 mix that has been done well, even if one is using a two speaker system. Well done the Cure, Now you must release In orange and Show on dvd to document the other two best cure lineups this far :).
B00005JKNF|5.0|I really love this movie and suggest that everyone at least try it.  If the style is not to your taste, then let's face it, you won't like it, but if you do enjoy this type of film, you will not be disappointed.  I do not see Gosford Park as a murder mystery, but instead as a commentary on social class set around the events of a murder. This commentary is very well-done as it is quite well-scripted and the actors perform wonderfully.  What I enjoy most about this film is its attention to detail.  I loved the movie so much that I watched it a few times and picked up on many little details that would not be noticed with one viewing.  For example, look closely at the label on &quot;Mr. Weisman's Man's&quot; pants when he has Mary in his room with him.  If you enjoy this movie as much as I do, you will be eager to watch it over again and appreciate such details.
B00008ADPF|5.0|I love this cd from the day it came out but one of my favorite songs has to be # 7 (figured you out) i don't know what it was about it but i love it...so buy this cd
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Most science fiction is an excuse for an action filled pseudo-epic special effects demo. Firefly has intriguing multi-dimensional characters that interact in unique ways. People with motives we can relate to and weaknesses we share. <br />    And for the special effects junkies out there... you won't be disappointed.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|As an Action movie Underworld is good, the battle sequences between the Lycons (Werewolves) and Vampires are spectacular.  The transformations for the Werewolves are also cool and one of the better ones (using CGI of course).  However there is a problem with the movie.  That problem is the love story twist in there that never really takes off.  It is hinted throughout and in the end confirmed but the love story is very lacking and one can tell that it wasn't thought through.  However with the spectacular action and better than average acting (there is no campy characters) this is definetly a good movie.
B00008PW2D|3.0|If you like the show then you'll appreciate this set.  The episodes are still good in the 5th Season.  The problem is that there are ONLY 8 episodes.  So you are paying the same price for half the quanity.  Even if you think the quality is still there it's not worth the price considering what else you can get.  Lower the price to $20 or less and then I'd give it 5 stars.    For fans it's a must have...for a casual viewer start with season 1-4.  If you still love the show, then Seasons 5-6 are must buys.  Just try to forget how much each episode costs.
B0000C1733|4.0|Overall, I don't have many complaints about this cd.  It has almost all of my favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers songs, and it has plenty of songs on the cd too.  The only thing I found wrong with it though was the arrangement of the songs.  How it was set up, it sounded a lot like Califonications (with some replaced songs).  The 2 new songs were also a treat, but since this was greatest hits, where was songs like Aeroplane, The Zehpyr Song, and Can't Stop?  I hope this isn't stopping you from buying the cd, because it is good, although there is some room for improvement.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I tuned into Firefly mainly for 2 reasons; it was sci-fi and, more importantly, Joss Whedon was the creator.  After seeing and becoming a fan of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; I knew Whedon understood that the genres of fantasy and sci-fi are only strange settings to tell good stories.  Good stories are Whedon's trade mark and he delivers here in spades.<br />I long to see what happens to these characters.  The rough but honorable captain, the stoic first mate and her wacky pilot husband, the ironic man named Jayne, the preacher with a mysterious past, the doctor on the run with his sister, whom he wishes to save from the evil men pursuing her, the cheerful and brilliant ship's mechanic and the captivating companion (escort).  Each is joy to watch.<br />Take this journey with them.  Buy the DVD series.  If you like sci-fi you will not be disapointed.
B00008PW2D|4.0|I'll have to admit that I was also surprised by the cost, however, I put that aside.  I am a very big S&amp;TC fan and have been from the beginning.  I did not let the cost stop me from purchasing this.  It's a welcome addition to my now full collection (until of course the last season comes).  I enjoyed my 4 plus hours viewing this disc.  It also comes with a Trivia Game for your S&amp;TC buffs along with a segment on the \\"costuming\\" of these wonderful characters.....for all others who seem to scoff at the price alone, well that's a shame.
B00008EYA5|2.0|I went to see this movie in the theaters twice and thought it was a good movie even though I really think it did a disservice to the tv series it was based on and to the fans of the series by totally changing the characters and by leaving out the best character, Dominic Luca. I put those feelings aside because I realized that there isn't any actor who could play the role of Luca, the way Mark Shera did. However when it came time for cameos they could have at least tried to get all the surviving members of the tv series to appear in the movie.<br />When I read that one of the special features on the DVD was going to discuss the original tv series, I figured that they were finally going to give credit to the actors who made the show great and fun to watch. I was very angry when they only focused on the two actors who made cameos in the movie. They showed clips that included the whole cast but failed to even mention who the actors were, what part they played, or what impact they had on making the show a hit. <br />So I guess I would say if you like summer action flicks then you will enjoy this movie but if you are looking for special features to go with the movie then it will be a waste of your money just like it was mine.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|If you're under, say, 40, this is a nice comedy about a couple of old people. But if you're over 40... or better, over 50... this is a hilarious, joyful romantic comedy that captures the best of some of the classic romantic film duos, like Tracy and Hepburn.<br />In fact, this film will remind you of a dozen films, some classics, that you've seen before. It starts out like a French farce and quickly turns into All That Jazz, and then The Man Who Came To Dinner, and then You've Got Mail. And so on, yet it manages to continually do so with freshness and originality. There may be a few cliches- it's hard to do a love story without falling into a few- but it still manages to suprise you and keep you interested from beginning to end.<br />Nicholson does a nice turnabout and plays something other than the stock manic character he's taken to parodying in so many films. If anything, he's parodying his own life here. And Keaton's performance has just a touch of parody of her most famous role, that of Annie Hall, but with much more depth and humor and sophistication. And it's great to see mature people playing mature people relating to other mature people, lines and all. The charatcters ring true as middle aged, neither prettied up nor turned into doddering parodies of age.<br />A wonderfully warm movie that celebrates love that lives on beyond youth, not to mention a great date film that both men and owmen will love. Go see it.
0151008116|5.0|What is belief? Can simply believing a story make it in some sense true? Is believing in love fundamentally different than believing in God? In fellow humans? Are people and animals different in their essential needs? In their desires? Are zoos morally defensible? Can one be a true, faithful adherent to multiple religions? These are some of the questions that get tossed around in this fable.<br />Two quotes seem best to summarize what was for me the most enchanting theme of this book: Some people \\"lack imagination and miss the better story.\\" And second: \\"If you stumble at mere believibility, what are you living for?\\"<br />This is one of the best books I've read in ages because it deals with one of my favorite obsessions -- the nature of belief -- without being at all preachy about it.<br />Is it a story good enough to make you belief in God, as the old man in the opening pages of the book claims? I'm not sure. Part of me says, \\"Oh, come on. It's just a novel. An invention. A story.\\" And yet to hold firmly to that very reasonable notion is not to have really read and understood the book at all.
B000002MUW|4.0|One of Madonna's most underappreciated albums to date. In my opinion, it's one of her best albums, and my favourite ever made by her. Every song has a special meaning, like &quot;Human Nature&quot;. There are true gems on this album. &quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Take A Bow&quot; did it well in the charts. &quot;Take a Bow&quot; became her greatest hit ever. Well, it peaked at the #1 spot in the US, but it didn't even get a chance to hit the Top 10 in the UK, making it her worst single from this album there.<br />RATED SONGS:<br />1: Survival <BR>I just don't understand why they didn't make this single material. It's one of my favourite tracks from this album with meaningfull texts. To me, it looks like perfect radio material, what a shame. Once you hear this song it can be that it will get stuck in your head. Yes, it is one example of &quot;those songs&quot;. Great melody and chorus. 8.5/10<br />2: Secret<BR>The first and prabably best single on this album. It's a song about a transvestite that tells her/his secret to her/his lover. That also is the message related behind the title song. I love the guitar and Madonna's vocals in here. This song won't get bored after listening 10 times or so to it. 9/10<br />3: I'd Rather Be Your Lover<BR>This song is kind of fun and can be kind of irritating either. This song has a groovy beat and even has a guest entry, done by Me'Shell NdegéOcello. It makes the song complete. It's one of the many songs on this album with an R&amp;B flavour, but this one also contains some rap, it's pretty cool. The thing that bugs me is that the chorus is played way too much! But the song is good enough to forget about that. 8/10<br />4: Don't Stop<BR>I had my doubts about this song, when I heard it for the first time I knew I was going to like it, but, there is something that is missing here. Sounds kind of something that would be played in the eighties alot, doesn't it? Well, don't look back there. This is Madonna's goodbye to that time. No single material, but it was played on the radio sometimes to replace &quot;Human Nature&quot; because of its offensive language. Overplayed chorus once again. 7.5/10<br />5: Inside of Me<BR>Well, I really like the background sounds on here. This again would be perfect single material, but it just couldn't happen. Kind of mellow song about her mother and the state Madonna's in. 8/10<br />6: Human Nature<BR>Not one of the best songs on here, but surely a big favourite! Madonna against the media, well, that's the thing that makes this song great, the meaning of it, the text. That's the thing that makes this a powerfull song, strangly even good enough for a dance. 8/10<br />7: Forbidden Love<BR>A classy love song. Great tune, great leading vocals by Madonna, and you even get to hear Babyface on this one with his backing vocals. The more you listen to it, the more you will like this one! As the song goes on, it will get better and better, giving you the chills! Love this one. 8/10<br />8: Love Tried to Welcome Me<BR>Someone who can't get in love. That's what this song is about. Great vocals. This song is mainly based on taste. Well, it's not really my taste, but don't get me wrong. I like it. 7.5/10<br />9: Sanctuary<BR>Very original! It can take a while to get used to. It wouldn't be great single material, but it's surely cool listening to because of its dark sounds. This song was way before its time. Cool electronic beats. 8/10<br />10: Bedtime Story<BR>I was very suprised when I saw the video of this song, it's stunning! The song didn't impress me that much. Again, way before its time. 7/10<br />11: Take a Bow<BR>A huge hit. And I don't really understand why. Again, backing vocals by Babyface. The melody sounds very charming and catchy. While it didn't make the Top 10 in the UK, it is her biggest single to date in the US. I'll give this song a chance by grading it high above average because of the sounds and vocals. I also like the video. 8.5/10<br />OVERALL GRADE: 8<BR>Underestimated but perfect. That makes this album special. I truly recommend this one!
B0000041A9|5.0|This should have entered into Gramophone Classical 100. What were the reviewers doing? Sleeping?
B00006FDCD|1.0|'It' really needed a Stanley Kubrick to write the screenplay. Streamline the plot and form it around the central, most terrifying aspect; a killer, shapeshifting creature. Full, uncensored violence in a trimmed two hour movie. Certainly beats out the tacky effects and gimmicks of this TV adaptation- as much as I like Tim Curry, the lines he had to go through (\\"One balloon not enough? Try a BUNCH!\\") were barely intriguiny at best. The only scene in 'It' that seemed remotely scary to me -in comparison to the book, mind you- was when It assumed the zombified form of Bev's dad.<br />One thing screenplay writers need to realize is that, as wry and humorous as King's lines can be on the page, they are almost uncomfortable to listen in his adaptations. I'm not saying the actors and actresses' talents wasted on a lousy script, because no one did a half-decent job anyway. As much as I liked Dennis Christopher in 'Breaking Away' his portrayal of Eddie at best annoyed me. The film's ending was confusing (I feel bad for anyone who didn't read the novel) and less than satisfying... although the novel's finish wasn't exactly Thanksgiving dinner.<br />It disappointed me all the more because I saw how badly adapted the original text was; I suggest if you've read the book and have yet to see the movie, just stay away. And for anyone else, there are far better, less confusing, much shorter horror movies out there.
B0000DCGT4|1.0|What a waste of comedic talent, such as Eugene Levy and Fred Willard.  The first two American Pies were hilarious, but this one was a total waste of time.
1561005533|4.0|This is a review of the cassette version and I must say I was rivetted to this story.  I sat in my car long after I arrived at my destination listening in fastination.<br />However, the hero Tanus, is just a little too outrageously perfect for me to give this a full 5 stars.  You know, never tires during combat, never loses his cool, never makes a fatal mistake.  I would have enjoyed a less god-like hero.
B00000273M|4.0|I never got into &quot;The Bangles&quot; much at the time, and I'm still not a huge fan, but this has plenty to make casual fans like me happy. Other than the huge hit &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian&quot;, this includes &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot;, &quot;In Your Room&quot;, and the #1 &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;. Plus it has &quot;Manic Monday&quot;, written by &quot;Prince&quot;, and &quot;Hazy Shade Of Winter&quot;, from the &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; soundtrack, and written by &quot;Paul Simon&quot;. Overall, this is at least half big hits, and a good choice for your 80's/girl band collection. They also have a new album out.
B00008PW2D|1.0|Only 8 episodes??  Previous box sets have had 16 or so in them.  If you really want to watch this - rent it at Blockbuster - don't waste your $ on purchasing it.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is the 2nd part in the LOTR Trilogy. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is an excellent film. The fellowship of 9 has broken but there are still people from it out there. Frodo and Sam continue their journey to destroy the One Ring created by Sauron, the dark lord of Mordor. Their guide is Gollum, deceitful and lust-filled, slave to the corruption of the ring.<br />Rated: PG-13 For Epic Battle Sequences and Scary Images.<br />Running Time: 179 Minutes
B000000OAN|5.0|Queen still are a highly rated band.  Their music always had an original edge and Brian May's guitaring was always flawless and Freddie Mercury's voice was always perfect.  29 years on you can still listen to this and say, 'is this really 1975'? Brilliant!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Her CD's are definately getting better each time, but the same thing still remains... her voice will never life up to Christina Aguilera.  What a waste of a nice dance beat.  This CD only has 2 good songs.  Trust me, I wouldn't pay full price for this.  I would buy it used or get if off ebay.
B000002KIE|5.0|This was way ahead of its time and is still brilliant now.  Punk definately died when these guys stopped.  Every track has a message.  If you think something then F****** write a song about it and shout it out!  Punk in comparision to all the cra* that was out there at the time was actually refreshing. F*** censorship, F*** the way people think and F*** the Monarchy.
B000002MY3|5.0|All of you, who wish to call yourselves fans of alternative rock should first own Alanis' Jagged Little Pill. It's a Cd with music that's still fresh in 2004 and that has set the example for many new artists like Michelle Branch or Avril Lavigne. <br />Although both Avril &amp; Michelle move in the same paths as Alanis, what they don't quite get is what Alanis triumphs upon in this album. <br />And that's making fresh music, that first of all they are gonna enjoy listening to and then their fans.<br />My songs rating is as follows:<br />1.ALL I REALLY WANT : 3/5 -a songs that stick to ur head<BR>2.U Oughta Know :5/5-a classic Rock song and one of my favorites<BR>3.Perfect: 4/5 - a mellow and sweet song about pressure upon children by their parents<BR>4.Hand In My Pocket: 5/5- It's amazing how in just one song she can fit a whole life<BR>5.Right Through You: 1/5- Not a good moment of the album<BR>6.Forgiven: 4/5- another great moment<BR>7.You Learn : 5/5 - a valuable rock lesson about life<BR>8.Head Over Feet :5/5- Another great mellow ballad<BR>9.Mary Jane: 5/5- A Great Story, an Awsome Song<BR>10.Ironic : 5/5 - A really great song about life's irony<BR>11.Not The Doctor: 2/5 - Just good, nothing special<BR>12.Wake Up:2/5 - same here, nothing special.
0066214122|2.0|For the first two thirds of Prey, I was enthralled.  Michael Crichton is one of my favorite authors, and Prey was up to my expectations.<br />Then in the last third, I thought the book fell to its knees.  The plot devices were no longer credible, even given the suspension of disbelief inherent to this type of book.<br />My hypothesis is that Crichton was thinking of the big screen when he wrote this book.  He put in things that will make great scenes with modern special effects, but that just don't work in print.
1586215817|4.0|I have not read many books, but I totally enjoyed &quot;Split Second&quot;.  At first is started out with immediate action.  Then the paced slowed a bit building up a plot of deception and mystery.  I liked how the two separate stories joined keeping me on edge more and more as the story unfolded.  I was hooked by the last third of the book. I would recommend it for new readers!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly has everything you could desire in Sci-Fi--great action, acting, dialogue, special effects, directing, the whole bag.  Sadly, as everyone knows, it was cancelled way too soon, leaving more questions than answers. What about the men with blue hands? What is Book?  What is River, really? Hopefully, the movie will get a green light.  If you are in the market for your Joss Whedon fix, you won't be disappointed.  If you are in the market for great sci-fi, you also won't be disappointed.  The set bears up well with repeated watchings, and the directors commentaries are wonderful.  Picture is lovely, sound is great.  3 thumbs up.  If I had three thumbs.
B00005B36H|5.0|Well, I can't say that I've been a Tool fan for a long time, but I definitely have fallen in love with them after listening to this album. I became an A Perfect Circle fan after a friend mentioned them to me a few months ago. I then learned that the lead singer of A Perfect Circle, Maynard James Keenan, was originally a member of a band called Tool. So I decided to buy their latest album and give them my ears for an hour or so. I don't regret it one bit. This album flows so amazingly. It truly blew me away the first time I heard it. &quot;The Grudge&quot; really gets your blood flowing with awesome guitar riffs mixed with spacy lyrics. Moving to the softer, more trippy feel of &quot;The Patient&quot; is an easy transition with a short instrumental known as &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot;. From there, you proceed onto the critically acclaimed single &quot;Schism&quot; via another short instrumental called &quot;Mantra&quot;. After that, things calm down with Parabol but pick right back up again with the second part, &quot;Parabola&quot;. Then comes the real energy. &quot;Ticks &amp; Leeches&quot; provides you with a true blast of pure, raw metal energy with insane guitar riffs and awesome drum beats. Things calm down for a few seconds at the beginning of &quot;Lateralus&quot;, but pick up about 30 seconds into the song and keep you into the rhythm for the rest of the 9 minute song. You then move to a relatively short, but very emotional song called &quot;Disposition&quot;. The end of that song brings you into the very addicting bass line of the introduction to &quot;Reflection&quot;, and keeps you going until the end of that 11 minute masterpiece. After that, &quot;Triad&quot; just seems like a blur, until you reach the final piece of the puzzle, &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot;. This song will touch something inside of you with it's chilling message. This CD has continued to amaze me with 20+ listens and will go down as one of my favorite albums of all time.

0783225733|5.0|Almost nine years after have watched the movie for the first time and nearly 34 years since the events it inspired took place, the movie \\"Apollo 13\\" seems even more captivating.  The story of Apollo 13, for any who have followed the space program and especially for those who witnessed it, is as gripping a story as has ever been told throughout American history.  It is fraught with drama, intrigue, plot twists, and thrilling danger.  What's more, it all really happened!  In April of 1970, the American public was already viewing the amazing accomplishment of landing on the Moon as pass&eacute; and could not have cared less about the Apollo 13 mission.  Interest was so apathetic that the astronaut broadcast as the ship was about to enter lunar orbit was not even carried on television.  The fickle public certainly had its interest piqued when, not long after the unwatched broadcast, a simple house-cleaning maneuver (stirring the oxygen tanks) exposed a deadly flaw that led to a tremendous explosion.  That explosion sent Apollo 13 flying out of control, ended any hopes of landing on the Moon, and left fate of the three astronauts (Commander Jim Lovell, LM pilot Fred Haise, and Command Module pilot Jack Swigert) very much in doubt.  The heroic efforts put forth by the members of Mission Control, as well as the astronauts themselves, the bring Apollo 13 safely back to Earth is one of the greatest stories ever told.<br /><br />Acclaimed director, Ron Howard, saw this and, inspired by Lovell's own personal account of that mission crafted one of the truly great historical films to ever hit the screen.  \\"Apollo 13\\" is a true cinematic achievement.  It re-ignites the imagination and wonder that the space program held in the 1960's and early 1970's.  Using cutting-edge special effects in service of the story (as opposed to in place of it), Howard is able to give audiences a true up close view of the entire Apollo mission.  Using archive footage to craft the special effects scenes, the director is able to make launch seem lifelike, as if the viewer is standing atop the tower watching the rocket about to lift off.  The scenes in space are well crafted and extraordinarily realistic.  When the astronauts are forced to shutdown much of the lunar module, and all of the command module, to conserve power, the abject cold and forlornness that these men were forced to endure is felt by the audience.  The true mark of this film's greatness is found in the fact that, even though we know from history that the men of Apollo 13 survived, the final moments during re-entry, as played out in the movie, are still incredibly gripping and tense.  Then, the emotional release that comes knowing they made it is so overwhelming that even the most cynical, hard-hearted viewer will get choked with emotion.<br /><br />The storytelling and effects of \\"Apollo 13\\" are great, but the film would likely have still fallen short if not for the tremendous cast hired to perform these roles.  Tom Hanks is solid as the unflappable Jim Lovell, Bill Paxton (who seems to always find a way into every blockbuster) is good as the trusted, but untested rookie Fred Haise, and Kevin Bacon gives an accurate portrayal of last minute replacement Jack Swigert.  Gary Sinise plays Ken Mattingly, the astronaut Swigert replaced due to fears of a measles infection, with appropriate melancholy.  The other truly standout performance is turned in by Ed Harris, who plays the no-nonsense rock of a flight director, Gene Kranz.  Harris truly deserved his Oscar nomination for this performance and there is certainly a strong argument to be made for him to have won the award over eventually Supporting Actor winner, Kevin Spacey.  \\"Apollo 13\\", itself, was a strong contender for Best Picture honors, only losing out to the worthy \\"Braveheart\\".  The one baffling question is why Ron Howard was omitted from the Best Director nominations (he would have to wait 7 more years before receiving his due for \\"A Beautiful Mind\\").<br /><br />\\"Apollo 13\\" is not only a great thriller; it is also a telling history lesson.  It enables us to remember those wondrous days of the quest to reach the Moon, as well as the drama of that imperiled flight.  These days, it is disheartening to realize how the space program has stagnated since those heady days.  \\"Apollo 13\\" proves, beyond a doubt, that we still have the men with the will, knowledge, and courage to take this space exploration to places beyond imagination.

B00003CX5P|3.0|A film by George Lucas<br />After years of watching and rewatching the original Star Wars trilogy, the first of three prequel movies was released in 1999.  Episode I: The Phantom Menace was a long awaited, and highly anticipated new (and first) chapter in the Star Wars Universe.  The previews teased of what was to come and it looked good.  After finally seeing the movie in the theatre, I was filled with part excitement and part disappointment, and the more I thought about the movie, the less excited I was about it.<br />This opening chapter presents us with a trade blockade on the planet of Naboo by the Trade Federation.  Two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are sent to negotiate a settlement to the blockade, but they are attacked by droids employed by the Trade Federation.  Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon end up on the planet of Naboo and become entangled in the local political situation with the blockade and rescue Queen Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman).  They also acquire a tagalong alien named Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best).  More about him later.<br />The Jedi and Amidala, along with Jar Jar end up on Tatooine (yes, that Tatooine).  They are helped out by a little slave boy named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), whom Qui-Gon believes is the one spoken about in some prophecy about \\"the one who will bring balance to the Force\\".  The rest of the movie is a mixture of Tatooine, and the attempts to free Naboo from the Trade Federation.  We see the Jedi Council for the first time, featuring Yoda (Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L Jackson).  We see the remnants of the Sith, Darth Sidious and Darth Maul (Ray Park) and their plots against the Jedi and their manipulation of the Trade Federation.  We see the first meeting of C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker).  We see the Old Republic that was, and the corruption of the Senate.  \\"The Phantom Menace\\" is truly a set up.  After watching this movie, we have a very good idea of how the Republic becomes The Empire, and we are introduced to key characters like Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  We even get to see the Jedi fight as true warriors, rather than two old men in \\"A New Hope\\".<br />There are some very exciting sequences in this movie.  Seeing the Pod Race on the big screen was rather impressive, and the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul and the two Jedi was the best lightsaber fight of the entire series thus far (without knowing what is in Episode 3).  I didn't even mind all of the talk about Trade and the Debates in the Senate.  So, what was my problem?  The movie was filled with a cast of capable actors, but the dialogue was so bad that I don't think anybody could have done a good job in delivering the lines (Pernilla August, as Shmi Skywalker was a notable exception for most of her scenes).  It was the writing.  Star Wars has always been on the simplistic side, with some silly lines, but for whatever reason, nothing seemed to work.  Add to this the issue of Jar Jar Binks, and it makes things a little bit worse.  Jar Jar is a character designed to appeal to kids.  He felt like the answer to Yoda, directed at small children.  But, he was rather annoying to adults, rather than being cute or interesting, as Yoda was (and is).  Jar Jar's clumsiness also negated what could have been a powerful battle scene between the Gungans and the Droid Army.<br />Why do I keep watching?  Because at the end of the day, it is a Star Wars movie, and my love of the original trilogy compels me to watch.  My expectations were so high that I acknowledge it would be difficult to meet them.  This was an enjoyable movie to watch, and it finds new life on DVD.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw Firefly while it aired on Fox. And I'm glad I didn't, considering how the Fox network dunderheadedly mishandled the Fall 2002 series -- the episodes were shown out of order, the astoundingly great two-hour pilot was scratched as not having enough action (preposterous!), and Fox cancelled Firefly after only half a season on the air.<br />Thank goodness for the DVD's. What a beautiful set of DVD's, what an amazing series. I am urging everyone I know to buy it because the pure enjoyment you get from this series is a rare thing. How to describe Firefly? You could say it's a combination futuristic sci fi drama/shoot 'em up western, but that wouldn't really capture why Firefly is so great, at least for me. I am not a fan of science fiction tv and westerns tend to leave me cold, so why do I love Firefly? I think the key magic ingredient may be the creator, Joss Whedon, the mastermind behind the critics' darling, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. (For those not yet initiated into the greatness that is Buffy, check it out. It's not just a silly teen drama. Really). <br />I've long been an admirer of Joss Whedon's television creations, but I think he may have created his magnum opus in Firefly. The smart dialogue, the nail-biting suspense, the humor, the lushly layered and often surprising characterizations (great acting, by the way), the complex plot arcs, the tantalizing hints (blink and you could miss them) of twists and turns to come -- wow. And the production values? Fantastic. This is truly great television. I have never written an Amazon review before although I am a frequent customer. But Firefly is so good that I couldn't resist writing my support and giving this set 5 stars. <br />So, buy Firefly! If you appreciate fiendishly clever, moving, funny, scary, smart and unique television, you'll love Firefly. Let's just hope that a Firefly movie gets made so that this amazingly unique constellation of stories and characters can live on in some form.
0679879269|5.0|The final volume of \\"His Dark Material\\" trilogy offers readers more, than they could expect from a final volume in a trilogy.<br />Most 3rd volumes are Endgames. We allready know the disposition of heroes and villains and although there can be some questions unanswerd, basically, they rarely pose completely new situations and problems for main characters. Not so here.<br />I won't say what Lira and Will faced in their journey here, because I really don't want to ruin the surprise. I'd only like to remind readers that this series is no ordinary one, even in its structure - can you remember another trilogy, which didn't give us one of the main characters (Will) untill volume 2?<br />There are also: an assasin, several new races, revelations about the nature of Spectres, a grand battle with the Kingdom of Heaven... <br />Well, what are you still reading the review for? Click the \\"Buy\\" button, allready! You won't regret it!
B0000VCZKM|1.0|This film was in Panavision. Where does Columbia get off giving us a \\"pan and scan\\" print of this film, and calling it an anniversary print? SAVE YOUR MONEY, WAIT FOR THEM TO \\"LETTERBOX\\" IT! Bad call, Columbia!
0440238609|5.0|These books left me breathless. Rarely can you read something with as well-realised world (even worlds) as this one. <br />We start in a kind of Victorian Oxford in a world were people have damons - which, while being separate, are a part of human being (it's too hard to explain this in several words, but it's not very comlicated, really). Our heroine is Lyra - a small girl, who will soon go on a great journey. Though it may sound like a kiddie book it is NOT. The book is mature in tone (espesially in later volumes) and may be not suitable for younger kids. For example, there is a scene where a bear catches and eats a seal. While not graphic, it's not something you'll often find in a book for children.<br />One of the strongest points of the trilogy is that it doesn't follow standard structure. For example, we won't meet some of the main characters untill the second book, and the third volume also holds enough surprises and new characters.<br />The books not only give us a wonderful universe, but also raise some questions, including religion and church which make some of the readers brand the books as anti-christian. In my opinion, this is not the case. Then again, if you consider books about Inqusition or \\"DaVinci Code\\" a threat to your fate, then you won't like this one. But, really, you should try to change your viewpoint, 'cause you will be missing a lot!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow, that about sums up how I feel about this series. Thanks to Fox's refusal to advertise the series, I didn't know about it until it was too late. I am a fan of all things Whedon (Buffy &amp; Angel), but even I have to admit that this truely is his swan song. The cast is perfectly intune with their characters and each other. This show is filmed so cinematically it feels like you are watching 1 hour movies, not episodes. The special effects are phenomenal. The 14 episodes made me laugh, cry, but mostly they made me mad (this is what going mad feels like), because there are no more. I pray for a movie and until then I watch and rewatch my episodes, you should do the same. Take my love, Take my land, Take me where I cannot stand. You can't take the sky from me.
0385504209|4.0|This book took off with and bang and the sprinter's pace continued throughout this marathon race to find the Holy Grail.<br />The book begins in Paris, France with a murder. On the surface, the clues from the murder point to the hero, a Harvard professor, and before he knows what is happening he and the heroine are on the run from the police. The story takes the reader from Paris, to London, to Scotland, and back to Paris in a breakneck pace. The main characters must solve the riddles and codes left for them, while avoiding the authorities and the people behind the murder.<br />I enjoyed this book alot. I had heard and read of a number of the points (Dead Sea Scrolls and DaVinci's artwork) and enjoyed Brown's weaving them into a very exciting story. The codes and clues to solve for the location of the Grail were clever, and added to the suspense of this thriller.<br />The information that Brown gives the reader will cause some to rethink what they've known. At a minimum it should cause the reader to look up more information on the subjects.<br />A very good and enjoyable read.
B000002L68|5.0|This CD is utterly flawless from start to finish.  <br />Prince is the the most underappreciated talent in the history of music - period.  With the term &quot;musical genius&quot; being thrown around far too often, this is one man who truly earns that distinction.  Any other musician would kill to have just an ounce of the talent that this man possesses.   His influence, guitar skills (to name just one instrument), and creativity are rivaled by very few (if any).  In addition, he remains - some 20 years later - the greatest live performer on the face of the earth.  He earned a (well-deserved) induction into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame in the first year he was eligible. <br />Rant over... now on to the review:<br />1. Let's Go Crazy: One of the most brilliant album starters ever heard.  Mind-blowing guitar solo one of the standouts of the album.  Just a great song.<br />2. Take Me With U: Great synth line and layered vocals.  The chorus seems so simple on this one, but it still rings true.  Great song for that Valentine mix CD! :)<br />3. The Beautiful Ones: Heartbreakingly beautiful.  Dang, this man can sing!  &quot;Do you want him... or do you want me?&quot; &quot;Paint a perfect picture / bring to life a vision in one's mind / the beautiful ones always smash the picture / always... every time.&quot;  One of his many &quot;non-hits&quot; that is as good as anything you'll hear.<br />4. Computer Blue: Angry, and testosterone-filled.  It's about the sadness of being lonely and wondering if you'll always be that way.  About 2 minutes in, it gets happy, before the ultimate anger trip...<br />5. Darling Nikki: A song about getting used.  Nasty and raw -- just like the feelings it expresses.  Great rock and roll vocal gymnastics by Prince on this one.<br />6. When Doves Cry: Perfect.<br />7. I Would Die 4 U: A song about sacrificing everything for someone you love.  Though, as with Let's Go Crazy (and many of his songs), Prince has a religious meaning here as well.<br/>8. Baby I'm A Star: Great song about being confident.  He's good, and he knows it. &quot;Might not know it now, baby but I are... I'm a star&quot;.  Good to play when you're feeling down.  And that leads us into...<br />9. Purple Rain:  Oh. My. God.  In my opinion, this is one of the greatest songs ever written.  It is a song about unconditional love and wishing for someone else the ultimate in happiness. On a personal note, the single greatest concert experience of my life occurred during this song.  To see and hear thousands of people of all ages, races, and backgrounds joining hands and singing along to this song while Prince made the most beautiful sounds with a guitar that I have ever heard... well, I'm sorry if you missed it.  <br />Purple Rain is a timeless masterpiece.<br />And it's not even his best album.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|This movie continues the struggles of Neo and the people of Zion against the Matrix. While not as good as the first, this movie was still entertaining.<br />The time is supposedly six months after the end of the last movie and the Matrix is mounting a major (and final attack) on Zion. The leaders of Zion must decide to attempt a counterattack or trust in 'The One'. The struggles of Neo and the decisions he must make...or are the decisions already made for him?<br />The fight scenes are great. My one criticism is that there was probably one too many fights. Bullet time is fantastic, but even too much of a great thing is not great. Having a fight to showcase the effect is not really neccessary at this point.<br />One must see from the DVD is the MTV Movie Award clip. I found it hilarious.<br />Following suit with other sequels, this one does not live up to the original. However the bar was set extremely high. It is better to look at this as the second installment of a larger story.

Miyazaki paints a wonderfull spirit world that is beautiful, amazing, scary, and funny. From the soot workers to Chihiro, the characters are great.<br />My children also loved the film. I recommend this DVD to parents and children. Another Miyazaki filem that is a must see is 'Castle in the Sky'.

1551112434|5.0|First published in 1868, Wilkie Collins' &quot;The Moonstone&quot; has been never out of print.  This fact testifies the popularity of the book, but somehow because of the famous comment by TS Eliot, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is likely to be regarded as 'detective fiction.'  The fact is slightly different, and you have to keep that in mind before you read it.<br />The story is absolutely the classic style of &quot;Who-Done-It.&quot;  The Moonstone, a sacred Hindo stone is stolen from India, and makes its way to the peaceful Yorkshire countryhouse where the rich daughter Rachel Verinder lives with her mother.  On her birthday night, however, immediately after the stone is presented to the young lady, it vanishes without a trace.  So, who stole it?  Or is it just 'missing,' as the inimitable London detective Sgt. Cuff thinks?<br />The story sounds like Agatha Christie (who, like Collins, wrote stories about the British middle-class), but if you are looking for some ingenious 'trick' or something, you will be disapponited.  The story is written BEFORE Sherlock Holmes is born, and though the basic elements of detective stories can be found here, Collins does not use them as you might expect the later writers like Conan Doyle do.  I cannot reveal much, but I can tell you that the whereabout of the stone is not necessarily the primary concern of the novel.<br />The most strikingly original aspect of the novel is its characters.  Remember, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is primarily a Victorian novel, and Wilkie Collins is one of the best friends of Charles Dickens, who wrote &quot;Great Expectations&quot; which attacks the idea of 'gentleman.'  The story is told by many characters themselves, and they unwittingly reveal the hidden side of their personalities in the narrative.  The best case is the statement of Miss Clack, whose too religious attitudes conceal her surpressed curiosity (and perhaps love) for handsome philanthropist Godfrey Ablewhite.  Clack's narrative, always amusing and in a sense grotesque, is one of the greatest among the 19th English novels.<br />About the mystery of the novel ... well, there are lots of them in there, but they are rather about how and why these colorful characters did certain things or didn't.  Rachel Verinder, independent and strong-willed (Collins loved this type of females), certainly knows something about the missing stone, but she never talks about it.  The housemaid Rosanna Spearman knows something about the 'smear' of the paint (one of the crucial points of the story), but she never talks about it ... until the time you know the reason.  The 'mystery' is about these people, rather than about the Moonstone.<br />{ABOUT THE BROADVIEW EDITION by STEVE FARMER}<br />Broadview's edition of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; comes in handy for academic use, so let me record the details of the book.  It has Mr. Farmer's informative introduction that follows the modern critical readings of the book.  Plus, you see the novel's contemporary reviews, and the play version of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (which Collins himself made for the stage) and even the reviews of that play.  You also get the excerpts of the letters concerning the novel and the play, and the brief newspaper accounts of the real-life cases of Constance Kent and Northumberland Street (both of which became part of the story).  The long (and well-chosen) list of select bibliography is included.<br />You may not find the same thrill as you have in Doyle or Christie, but &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is still a good example of great storytelling.  Read it like you read Dickens, another great storyteller.<br />&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is made a TV show starring Greg Wise in UK in the late 1990s.

B0000C0FJB|4.0|The acoustic version of Resist and the inclusion of The Pass makes this album worth the price, if you ask me. However, the mix on the entire CD is really far from great.<br />One of my biggest complaints on Rush live is how the guitar of Alex Lifeson so easily gets lost behind the drums, keyboards, bass and vocals.  This is the soundman and Alex's attempt at trying to resolve that issue, but ends up with a worse mix than what I've heard on the other live albums.<br />For example, The Big Money is really akward and I feel on the edge of my seat that the mix just does not blow up, because things are so out of wack.  You can hear Alex's guitar in places where you really don't need too and the bass is way too loud in the mix ... while the vocals and driving keyboards are pushed in the background.<br />It almost sounds like this album was mixed at a very loud level, but never reviewed at lower levels across different types of studio monitors.<br />However, as I noted above, The Pass is a great mix (probably since it is from the guitar-dominant Presto album) and having an acoustic version of Resist is great.<br />There is a great story in the linear notes about the tour in Brasil too, so it's neat to read how 120,000 people saw Rush over three concerts.
B0000DZEA1|3.0|Sorry for posting this review twice. I didn't aware that I was logged in from my another account that I don't write reviews with.<BR>.......<BR>Right after my first viewing of the film, I headed to the local music store and bought this CD without any thought. To be honest, I didn't even look at the track list.<br />The filmscore as played in the movie was too great. Several nice pieces of music integrated very well with the momentum of the film, and helped make this already-great-movie a better one. I was thrilled when Minas Tirith theme first played in its full scale in the movie, and was even more thrilled when riders of Rohan charged into the enemy at Pelennor field. That was one of the most emotional moments of the movie.<br />I found this soundtrack CD to be quite good, but very incomplete one. Don't try to compare this with any of its predecessors (FotR and TTT).<br />First of all, several tracks are incomplete. For example, &quot;The Ride of Rohirrim&quot; abruptly ends in high tension, the same goes for &quot;The Field of Pelennor&quot; as well.<br />Secondly, where is the theme that played when the riders of Rohan arrived at the Pelennor and where is the theme that played when the riders charge at the enemy?<br />Just a word, though, they should take soundtracks of Star Wars original triology as an example of how to do the soundtrack CD. For movies that filled with orchestral themes like this, it is the best if when you listen to the CD with your eyes closed ... you will see the movie playing in your mind.<br />On the bright side, let me say again that this is a nice CD to have in the collection. Additional song by Annie Lennox is quite a good one and really give a relax feeling, as the ending to the Grey havens after all the pains and tirenesses should be (although I still like her &quot;Love Song for a Vampire&quot; better).<br />I really wanted to give this CD a 4-star rating. However, I decided that 3-star will do. Maybe I expected too much after seeingthe RotK movie and enjoyed FotR and TTT soundtracks CDs.
B000002KGT|5.0|I recently became a fan of FM's after getting their latest album and going to a concert of theirs. I have been since buying their albums and have enjoyed this very much. Nicks, McViie, &amp; Buckingham's vocals are great. Fleetwood and McVie rhythms are great, and w/such great lyric too! A+++++!
B0000C9JFO|1.0|It is incomprehensible how this movie gets so many good reviews. It fails on every level. It intended perhaps to be a \\"Big Chill\\" type movie for the modern Euro generation---but it has none of the depth or warmth, or only the idea.    The movie depends most of all on creating characters in a warm communal setting, where we can watch their interactions. That's the first flaw, since most characters are cardboard cut outs we never get to know, but are required to care about. So, it fails on that level, its most important.     Warning: Modest spoiler coming.    The plotting is inexplicable and filled with holes. Our hero, at the end, for some reason abandons his life's dreams. Supposedly, he has had some major revelations based on his shallow experiences in Barcelona.  Nothing that occurred would give you any reason why--or show why he was so deeply affected by his crude misconduct in Barcelona.     Another major flaw--our hero is basically despicable. Yet, this movie not only does not care, but makes great fun of it. If this is the epitome of the new, forward thinking Euro generation, please, oh please, let's go back in time. Our hero, for instance, is befriended by a French couple in the airport. They help him. They open their home to him. He returns the favor by taking seduction lessons from a lesbian, and seducing the wife of his benefactor.     This remarkable misconduct merits NO particular self-examination or regret. NO apologies. In fact, it's such a minor incident to the filmmaker that the French couple comes to our hero's going away party without recrimination. Ludicrous.    Oh, at the same time, our hero is cheating on his girlfriend back home, and flirting with others, too. This ALSO merits no particular thought. So, the great revelations our hero supposedly had in Barcelona that cause abandonment of his life's dream couldn't be too great---since he is overly shallow and wastes no time thinking twice about anything.     This mish-mash of a movie succeeds onno level, in short. The characters are not real, the scenarios are ludicrous. The supposed charm does not exist. It's often tedious and boring. You wonder why you should care at all.     Oh, and Tautou is wasted in a minor role.    P.s. I see few people think this helpful. I guess in the world of true fanatics, a word of criticism or does of reality is not acceptable.  The simple truth is that this was not terribly well done, a little forced wistfullness dressed up as something important.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I'll keep this short-i'm not very good at writing reviews, but this DVD is worth every penny.  The extra scenes add so much to the film, and Tolkein fans will like some of the extra info.  Anyone who claims to be a LOTR fan has to have this in their collection.
B00008DDXC|5.0|There is no doubt that the first Harry Potter movie, &quot;The Sorcerer's stone&quot; was a smash hit.  The movie did an excellent job telling a story and at the same time introducing all the characters.  This time around, it plunges right into the story and doesn't let up!  The story is wonderful, the acting is superb, especially Daniel Radcliffe,  and the effects and sets are absolutely mezmerizing.  This movie is truly one for any DVD collection!  Both young and old will love this sequel that is even better than the original!
B000002HPT|3.0|My first exposure to Dream Theatre was this album.  I listened to it, absolutely TRANSFIXED, from start to finish at a listening station in Tower Records when it first came out.  Best prog-metal I had heard since late 70's Rush.  I bought it on the spot.<br />But then over time, the excitement wore off as I began to absorb the lyrics.  Sorry, but lyrics are an important aspect to my listening experience, and these are dark and depressing.  The more I listened to this album, the more depressed I felt.  I have since taken a chance with a few other DT albums, with the same reaction.<br />Don't get me wrong, they are fantastic musicians.  I enjoy the Liquid Tension Experiment discs;  I enjoy Derek Sherinian's solo stuff; I enjoy anything Mike Portnoy plays drums on, such as Transatlantic and Neal Morse's Testimony.  But when these guys get together under the banner of Dream Theatre, I just can't take the negative vibe they put out.  So, if you can get past the lyrics, this is one butt-kickin album!
B000084T18|1.0|His rapping is so corny! Don't believe the hype on 50.. get a good album from Biggy instead.
B00005JMTQ|1.0|Let's start with the fact that I disagree with most of the reviewers.  This was a fairly atrocious film, and I lay the vast majority of that blame on the director, Nancy Meyers.<br />To name just a few of the problems: she absolutely did not reign in any of the actors.  I doubt very much if anything was rehearsed, even on the day.  Seeing Keanu Reeves and Diane Keaton on the screen is like watching two different movies spliced together in the editing studio.  The shot design was strange, to use one word.  And the transitions were, while possibly well-intended, awkwardly executed.<br />The dialogue could not have been worse, except possibly if written by Ed Wood.  Ms. Meyers has no rhythm of these particular characters.  In fact, some of Erika Barry's (Keaton's) dialogue could have been said by Judy \\"Private\\" Benjamin (yes, Ms. Meyers penned that one, too).<br />Ms. Meyers continues to write the same neurotic woman over and over again, and frankly, while it was hilarious in Private Benjamin, and was cute in Baby Boom (weren't Diane Keaton's physical antics the same in that one?  What, another middle-aged woman who wants to get laid character?  AGAIN?), I, for one, got rather bored with it in Protocol, and by the time Father of the Bride, Part II (wasn't Part I punishment enough?), rolled around, that was plenty.<br />In any event, I have to concede the following: I did laugh a couple of times, particularly at Jack Nicholson's behind.  And, having seen it in a movie theater filled with 50- or 60-something kinds of people, they seemed to enjoy it, if only for the concept that they can have sex, too.  Whooptee-doo.<br />If you are past 40, and having doubts whether there is someone that will find you desirable, rent it some rainy afternoon when you have nothing to do.  But please, do not waste your hard-earned money on a theater ticket or the DVD.  Short of showing Keanu Reeves's behind, I doubt that there would be anything there I'd want to see again.
B0000039PW|5.0|The best Rapper that ever lived. Best Rap Album ever. You are so Missed Big Poppa!
B00005JMGC|3.0|\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" might as well be called \\"Julia Roberts Smile.\\"<BR>It is through and through a Julia Roberts vehicle. If you liked erin brockvich, you'll like (if not love) this movie. If not...well there are a few things that might make the movie worth its price.<br />\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" takes place at Wellesley College (all women) in the academic year 1953-1954. At the start, Julia Roberts is seen on a train-she plays Katherine Watson, an idealistic young ARt History professor, traveling from California to teach at the school of her dreams. <br />The movie portrays the students of Wellesley at that time as brilliant, beautifully dressed at all times (if you like cashmere and pearls, you'll love this movie), snobby and hell bent on getting married. Roberts' character is shocked (shocked!) that her students do not use their brilliant minds to think on their own and to apply to law school etc. And she sets about to change them.<br />She spends most of her time with four students-brilliant Joan (Julia Stiles) whom she encourages to ditch her fiancee for Yale Law School, snobby Betty (Kirsten Dunst) who marries early in the first semester, slutty Gisele (Maggie Gylenhall) who has slept with a male professor and Julia's love interest, and wallflower Connie (Ginnifer Goodwin). All of the students (with the exception of a wooden Julia Stiles) are excellent and actually try to act (something Julia really doesn't). They have tough jobs as their characters are all one-note.<br />However, Marcia Gay Harden steals the movie as Julia's roommate, a lonely middle-aged professor who teaches speech and elocution, and is a homemaker without a home. It would have been a far better movie if she had been in the lead role.<br />Several things in the movie do work well. The sets and costumes are outstanding (much of the film was shot at Wellesely, which is beautiful). The soundtrack is AMAZING-with covers of 50's songs from a diverse group of 00's artists (e.g., Seal, Chris Isaak, Macy Gray). <br />I would recommend this movie to Julia Roberts' fans and to those individuals who enjoy \\"woman-themed\\" (e.g., chick flick) movies. And if you're a fan of the early 50's...you'll love this movie.
B0000039QA|5.0|Biggy is now about having fun, you can hear it in his voice, its like he entered heaven and is telling us how great it is. The album is filled with happy songs that can be played at a party that everyone can dance to. Big Poppa you are missed.
0780626494|5.0|OK, you can read the 128 other reviews, many of which feel compelled to tell the plot of this movie when Amazon has already done so, or you can take 60 seconds and hear my opinion for what it's worth...<br />This is not a complex movie, it is meant to be a funny look at the culture shock Brendan Fraser gets when he emerges from 30 years in a fallout shelter into modern-day L.A.  And guess what, it is funny!  All the actors give fine performances, the criticism of Alicia Silverstone is unwarranted because she is SUPPOSE to be playing a whiney, self-centered, shallow Los Angelan.  The cussing is necessary to prove a point, and it is kept to a minimum.  All in all it is a lighthearted movie with a good ending.  Sure, it may be somewhat predictible, but it is entertaining and well worth renting and buying.<br />OK, I asked for a minute of your life to hear my opinion, and that is it.  Thanks for your time, I hope it was worth it!
B00001ZWTT|1.0|This movie was  hyped up so much that it just had to fail. The script was predictable, and even the acting was bad from every actor. I hate that  wasted money on this movie. Guess it just shows you to: DON&quot;T BELIEVE THE HYPE!
031286504X|5.0|A man alone in the world of vampires lives to learn what they are and what happened to the world. It is frightening, intelligent, touching and tragic. This story is much much bigger than its hundred pages. I can't stress enough how important this book is for the reader of horror. It truly defines what the vampire is and why. Absototalutely wonderful.
B0000640SB|1.0|People warned me this movie was cheesy, but I just had to see it for myself. God it sure was. But adleast it wasn't as bad as the sequel.
0451169514|4.0|I would not say that this is my favorite King novel. But it really is what King's novels are all about. As all of the king work marches toward the Dark Tower, I think we'll find that this story is infinitely important to what goes down. IT is so reflective of the themes we find in every novel. It is about the monsters of our childhood. It is about what scares us. Similar in theme to Straub's Ghost Story in that the monsters are only a reflection of ourselves. We make them. It is a brilliant work. It loses a star only because I found it almost silly at times, but nonetheless, if you read one book over a thousand pages long this year, make it this one. IT is what King is all about.
B00004STUL|5.0|I really liked this movie. Dramatic and funny by 2 funny comedians. You now you sang &quot;bad boys bad boys, whatcha gonna do&quot; that's just how much we all loved it.
B00005U1YO|5.0|This was the first album I heard by the Chemicals, so my that will affect my opinion somewhat.  I was introduced to them after hearing John Cusack's character play &quot;Leave Home&quot; in his DJ set in &quot;High Fidelity.&quot;  Once I heard that mindblowing song, I found &quot;Come with Us&quot; at the public library and was mightily impressed.  All the songs here are strong and include some of their best ones to date (&quot;Star Guitar,&quot; &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;).  After hearing this CD, I got a hold of &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; and &quot;Dig Your Own Hole,&quot; which while good, weren't as strong as &quot;Come with Us.&quot;  (I have yet to hear &quot;Surrender,&quot; though I do like the songs included on their greatest hits CD.).  Every song on this CD keeps your attention and makes great additions to mix CD's.  If &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot; isn't on your cruising CD, then your drive will be a letdown.  If &quot;Star Guitar&quot; isn't on your dance all night compilation, then you might as well stay at home.  Hopefully, the song &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot; is the song that points to the future for the Chemicals, since its ethnic percussion mixed with electronic music is the wave of the future (just check out any wonderful compilation from Six Degrees Records for the latest in that field).  Needless to say, I will be very interested to see where the Brothers go next, but till then, I will wear out this CD, if that's possible.
B00005B36H|5.0|We are kind of stuck in a limited musical/visual era, juggling between Teen pop, Rap and Punk revival.  None of them really caught my attention, I am so tired of those Teen pop and Rap swinging their half naked body in front of the camera.  Punk revival, haha, most are only a bunch of kids with kid's voice who needs to keep their music very simple not to disturb their jumping.  Where are the nice artistic videos?  Did they all forgot that we are in a high technology era!!<br />Few bands are looking for new musical horizon, Tool is one exception.  There always evolution in their songs (starts as something but become something else).  The drum and percussion are awsome, very tribal.  Guitar is unusual, slow and kind of dissonant, I like that.  Maynard's voice meets perfection except on &quot;Tick &amp; leeches&quot;.<br />Favorite song: the one that has the less in it, a tribal drum solo with weird noises over it:  powerful &quot;Triad&quot; song.<br />Second favorite:  the looping one with (le ti-boeuf) on the bass and a weird sound which could be an electronic violin or he is playing with a bow on his guitar.  I like the rest pretty equally.<br />I like them
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see Mrs. Bennett as an excruciatingly loud mother who lives only to search for husbands for her daughters. We can see Mrs. Bennett favors Jane as her first priority for finding a husband because she is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. One instance is when Mrs. Bennett found out Mr. Darcy was moving into a neighboring house. When she found out he was single, she automatically suggested/recommended Jane as a potential future wife. In contrast we start to see and understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense of his daughters. He doesn't critique his daughters when it comes to men.<br />I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50 because this story deals with the trouble girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, to which we can relate. The daughters were not that old, yet they were mature for their age. Teens will enjoy it because we all go through these teen stages of boys, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.<br />One literary device that was used in the story was analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. We are able to see their differences, but along with it their common interests start to show. For example, they both come from a different social background and yet are both intelligent, and have a tendency to judge harshly.<br />Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice, because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murder, but this story is nothing like this. It builds its own suspense through character's personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the early 19th century that reminds us of their rules and regulations that were used back then. For example women were just expected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I initially would have given this album 3 and half stars, but I don't think 4 stars is too generous for this fine album. &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; takes a couple listens to get past the grit and uncover the gorgeous. Interpol combine the two quite nicely. It's both retro and modern. Don't expect this album to give immediate gratification; patience is definitely a virtue when it comes to this album. It's well worth your time.
B000002L7J|5.0|What's the best thing about this album? Besides the music? Besides the atmosphere and the time and the culture it so perfectly evokes? Besides the occasional overwroughtness and the occasional clumsy moves? It's that nobody could dare to try to duplicate this sound or this feel. And that's the mark of a great album.
078401213X|5.0|Pi is one of the most creative, disturbing and introspective movies ever released.  While it may not be everyone's cup of tea ('Requiem for a Dream' seems to have appealed to many more people), Pi is about a possible schizophrenic who has discovered the answers to many questions about the stock market, religion, and so forth-- the 216 digit number he has is in his head, and people are hunting for him as he goes more and more insane with paranoia and confusion by the day.  The movie is entirely in black and white, filled with bizarre camera angles and recurring scenes involving his mental illness and insanity.  It's hauntingly real, traumatic, and artistic.
0385504209|1.0|An easy read that pulls you in from the start. I really wanted to like this book, but my intellectual integrity wouldn't let me. This is the most poorly researched book I have ever read. It is riddled with basic factual errors, geographical errors, art history fallacies, and historical inaccurances, not to mention the absurdities concerning Christianity. It would have been so simple to cross-reference a few ideas, check a date or two, pick up a map of Paris, verify claims about events...I can't think of any reason for this embarrasing mess of mis-information. I strongly advise readers lacking a background in the arts to balance this read with research of your own, or critiques of this book highlighting the countless errors.
B00000K0EA|3.0|Although it was originally planned that Pierce Brosnan would take on the James Bond mantle from Roger Moore in the mid-80s, the exhilaration of &quot;Goldeneye&quot; (his actual first Bond film) wears off rather quickly, I'm afraid.<br />You see, I've been spoiled by superior and definitive renditions of the Moore and Connery Bonds to be swayed by Brosnan's working class efforts.  Or maybe the product placement is just too obvious in recent 007 films?  Either way, this film is just a blip on the screen of an otherwise unstoppable series.<br />The pros: the sizzling Michele Yeoh as the latest Bond girl, who's both lethal and beautiful, in the best traditions of the genre.<br />***The proper use of henchmen--Gotz Otto revamping Robert Shaw's oversized killer who nevertheless is no match for Bond.<br />***And finally, the suitably grandiose (if unoriginal) world-domination plot that has since been missing in action.<br />The cons: Teri Hatcher--Bond girls have never been famous for their acting skills, but Hatcher looks and sounds out-of-place here.<br />***An unappealing villain--Jonathan Pryce doesn't have the charisma or the physical appeal to be a proper Bond villain (much less a memorably one).<br />***The title song by Sheryl Crow; easily one of the worst in the series.  The outro closing torch number by K.D. Lang should have been the title cut; it's classic Bond fare.<br />***Product placement is far too obvious in this film; enough is enough, guys.<br />Overall, a briskly paced entry in the Bond canon, but it's not firing on all cylinders.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This album is one for the ages.  I simply adore it, I can't get enough of it, and someday I suppose I will stop listening to it.  But that day has yet to arrive.  Just buy it on instinct -- if you have an inkling that you'll like it, do it.  That's what I did.  And now Rufus moves me daily, for reasons I can't even explain.
B00003CXXM|3.0|I found it rather amusing to see this film--Matt Damon's first real foray into &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; territory--derail any of Ben Affleck's hopes of becoming a credible action star.  Although not as mysterious as it should be (especially when compared to the book), &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; has several things going for it, not the least of which is a brisk pace, and credible direction.<br />For starters, Europe looks much better through the eyes of Director Doug Liman than it did in Brian DePalma's &quot;Mission:Impossible&quot;.  Filming on location in Europe will always look better than on a studio backlot, no matter what the pundits say.<br />The action sequences are quite good; although they're more violent than spy thrillers from my youth, they're not as over the top as they could be, but still frenetic enough to appeal to martial arts buffs as well as fans of the original novel.<br />Another plus is the use of Franka Potente, who fits the role of Maria far better than any name, plastic-surgery-disaster actress from Hollywood.  At the very least, she and Damon possess far more chemistry than did Affleck and Charlize Theron in the tepid &quot;Reindeer Games&quot;.<br />From top to bottom, a crisp, by-the-numbers spy movie that will keep you entertained throughout, but I doubt this film will age very well.
B0000UN25A|5.0|Joe Cocker &quot;The Ultimate Collection 1968-2003&quot;, is the first Cocker CD compilation, to adequately cover his entire career since 1968 to 2003.  With 30 tracks, this is a fine sampling of some of his biggest hits.  This is the perfect CD for someone who is considering buying a Cocker Cd for the first time.  Disc one is by far the stronger cd, with classic tracks like, &quot;Feelin' Alright&quot;, &quot;Unchain My Heart&quot;, &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;, &quot;The Letter&quot;, &quot;When The Night Comes&quot;, &quot;She Came In Through The Bathroom Window&quot; and &quot;Cry Me A river&quot;, just to name a few.  Disc two has some nice tracks from his more recent efforts, like &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot;, &quot;The Simple Things&quot;, &quot;Have A Little Faith&quot;, &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; and a great take on Leonard Cohens &quot;First We Take Manhatten&quot;.  &quot;With A little Help from My Friends&quot;, to &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot;, they are all here to enjoy on 2 discs.  The version that will be released in the US will be called &quot;The Ultimate Joe Cocker&quot;, but will have only 20 tracks, but does contain his grammy nominated song with the Crusaders from 1981 &quot;I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today&quot;.  You can get this import, at a very reasonable price on Amazons used dealer network or e-bay.  I paid $17.00 with S+H included on e-bay.  His music sounds as good today, as it did back in the 1960's.  Considering all that Cocker has been through during his career, and the fact he has long out distanced most of his 1960's contemporaries, makes him in my eyes a classic rock n roll treasure.  This is one collection not to be missed for fans both old and new.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|THE BAND: Maynard James Keenan (vocals), Billy Howerdel (guitars), Jeordie Orsborne White (bass), Josh Freese (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2003) 12 tracks clocking in at approximately 50 minutes. Included with the disc is a 5-page foldout containing odd pictures as usual, a sentence (lyric) or two from each song, a list of musicians, and thank you's. All songs written by Keenan and Howardel, except \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" (Edwards & Andrews), and \\"Crimes\\" and \\"Gravity\\" written by the entire band. Label - Virgin Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Howerdel's brainchild comes to fruition on \\"Thirteenth Step\\". I absolutely love this album. The year 2003 was a great year for music - some rock/metal/progressive/alternative bands really put out some incredible discs (Dream Theater \\"Train Of Thought\\", Coheed & Cambria \\"In Keeping Of Silent Earth III\\", Godsmack \\"Faceless\\", Spock's Beard \\"Feel Euphoria\\", Devon Townshend \\"Accelerated Evolution\\", etc. But the one I put at the top of the list is A Perfect Circle's \\"Thirteenth Step\\". It's hard to put into words... this album is so vastly different than most of my 1500+ cd's in my collection. It's doesn't fall into the hard rock/metal category like Tool at all. It's more experimental, poetic and alternative. There are some rockers here, but a majority of the tracks are on the soft, melodic side of the spectrum. Highlights include the 7+ minute opener with it's heavy bass line \\"The Package\\" (my favorite on the album); the haunting \\"The Noose\\", the mainstream rockers \\"Blue\\" and \\"The Outsider\\", and the soft closer \\"Gravity\\". As much as I listen to this disc though, there is one painful song... \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" (4 minutes of torture). I take this with a grain of salt though - as so many brilliant albums have a mind-boggling bad song present... the first (other) album that comes to mind is The Police's \\"Synchronisity\\" - an almost perfect album with the exception of Andy Summer's song \\"Mother\\". The future of A Perfect Circle is in question... as Keenan keeps going with Tool and his other side projects. Perhaps guitarist Howerdel will search elsewhere for a singer (I've read in several articles he wanted a female vocalist first)? There are a lot of mixed reviews here and it seems listeners either love this one or hate it. It's different, and that's why I like it so much (5 stars).estion... as Keenan keeps going with Tool and his other side projects.

0061015725|2.0|Sorry, I know I'm going to be in the minority here, but I found this book darn near impossible to plod through. Not because of the science (although any thriller whose chills depend on understanding geometric algorythems is, by nature, going to lose points with me), but because it felt so pointless. I found it difficult to be afraid of what amounted to genetically manipulated dust mites. Worse still, there were few chills (unless, unlike me, you find the idea of the aforementioned dustmites chasing you through the desert terrifying), and those few came late in the book (not to mention felt as if they were designed less for their chill-factor and more for the &quot;won't this look cool on the big screen&quot; effect). Oddly enough, the book is much more interesting during the opening chapters, when it sticks close to home and gives us a growing sense of dread about what might be happening to the wife and children. Ironically, once we abandon the homefront in favor of a trip to the desert, things cool down dramatically.
B00004RHZU|4.0|I give this album four stars even though I thought I'd be getting an album full of Pink anger and growling vocals, but instead I bought the Toni Braxton version of Pink. She sings as well as ever, but to this monotonous rap beat music that after the first two songs you wonder if the cd player got stuck and is replaying the same song over and over.<BR>I would give it two stars because I'm not a fan of this music style, but Pink's voice is too good to do it that kind of injustice. Buy this album if you like Toni Braxton. Don't buy it if you expect to hear some original Pink.
B00005JMGC|2.0|In Mona Lisa Smile, Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) joins the faculty of an all-girl's college to teach Art History. But because the girls are being taught how to be passive housewives instead of independent thinkers, she also works to impart her feminist ideals to the students and school board.<br />What a timely pictures this is! In a time when Oprah, Jennifer Lopez, and Britney Spears are as financially successful as their male counterparts, the film is definitely dated as a result. The unfaithful opposite sex is the most timeless aspect of the story. Ironically, there is only one guy in the film who is supportive of feminism. This is ironic because MLS is supposedly an advocate for evenhandedness. Clearly the scriptwriters - who are surprisingly men -- could have driven their point home by depicting an equal amount of good and despicable guys.<br />It must have been a stretch for Julia Roberts (one of the most traditional actresses of today) to play the role of a nonconformist, considering the fact that she has more asinine romantic comedies under her belt than risk-taking independent films. Interestingly, Roberts has allowed herself to succumb to the same imprisonment that the female characters of this story experienced unwillingly. Sure, Roberts has lately starred in a few films by acclaimed independent film director Steven Soderburgh (Erin Brockovich, Full Frontal, and Ocean's 11), and an unconventionally bloody romantic comedy called The Mexican, but she isn't a nonconformist at heart. Unsurprisingly, her portrayal of a feminist is as believable and passionate as a KKK member portraying an NAACP affiliate.<br />Nonconformist Maggie Gyllenhaal, who bravely portrayed a masochist in the Secretary, plays the role of the school's whore. Unfortunately, because the film is such a brief ensemble drama, her character isn't given time to bloom into a three-dimensional human being. She isn't even given enough scenes to demonstrate how much of a whore she is. As a result, poor Gyllenhaal, who is one of the cinema's latest talents, is underused.<br />The film's best performance comes courtesy of the younger, underrated Kirsten Dunst, who plays the role of one of the school's most outspoken students (though not outspoken enough to be a feminist, obviously). Dunst accentuates her emotions with great subtlety via her piercing green eyes, effortlessly switching between intimidating and vulnerable without ever transforming into a salivating, Oscar-hungry bloodhound. She is Mona Lisa Smile's main attraction.
B00005JME0|5.0|You cant play God. Oh yes you can the people who made this movie did. it is the coolest thing ever i saw a prescreening of it. Wow.Just watch it ok just love it<BR>2bad you can only put 5 stars on it ...
B000092Q4U|5.0|Hahahahaha...that's hilarious. You're very funny. Deftones suck. Live and in the studio. Lamb of God is also not loud. They aren't death metal either. They are REAL nu-metal. Not Linkin Park crap, I mean real nu-metal. Nu-metal is the most hated subgenre of metal, but this band is one of the finest. This is pretty easy listening for me though. If you want loud get EXtol, ZAO, Origin, Nile, Cryptopsy, Suffocation, Crimson Thorn, Sympathy, Vomitorial Corpulence (the loudest, heaviest, and most brutal band in existence), and Tortured Conscience. Deftnes, ha!
B00005MK9Y|5.0|This has been one of my favorite albums for a long time.I really cannot imagine what it would have been like to be there at this concert. I like most live cds but sometimes you don't feel the energy of the concert. Somehow this does the trick beautifully. During all of the songs you can tell their band is just rockin'. They are so in tune to each other. There isn't a bad song on the cd. Even though it is nearly impossible to choose a favorite Bob Marley cd I'd say this is mine. I just love this cd. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes music. I think you will all enjoy it. in fact if you don't you should post a review on here and tell me. I'll be checking.
B00004VWAF|4.0|Miles Davis' On The Corner is certainly a bizarre album and one you have to listen to many times to let it grow on you. It's not only his funkiest album but also his most chaotic. Everytime you listen to it, you notice something different. The opening suite is the best track here. It's really heavy on the percussion, guitarist John McLaughlin's funky lead playing, and Miles' solos where he largely plays with a wah-wah pedal. Keyboards and sitars periodically enter and exit the track while Michael Henderson's bass lines are kept to the bare minimum.<br />The remaining tracks, &quot;Black Satin&quot;, &quot;One And One&quot;, and &quot;Helen Butte/Mr. Freedom X&quot; are all essentially the same track, only with different things going on in each. &quot;Black Satin&quot; is a basic melody played by Bennie Maupin on bass clarinet and Carlos Garnett on sax, with very little else going on other than the percussion. &quot;One And One&quot; is the jazziest track here with both Maupin and Garrett playing more traditional solos. As on the first track, Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea veer in and out of the track periodically. Because of its length, &quot;Helen Butte/Mr. Freedom X&quot; works the best out of the three tracks because it gives more time for all the members to add something as well as change the mood of the track. But like &quot;Black Satin&quot; and &quot;One And One&quot;, it gets repetitive after awhile. Traditional jazz fans hated this upon release and still do, but On The Corner is an album ahead of its time with its use of overdubbing rhythms, tape looping, and heavy emphasis on the groove. It's definitely an acquired taste.
B00008AY3L|3.0|I'm a fan of Harper's earliest albums, and I have to confess that I found this disc somewhat disappointing. Yes, Ben does dip his toes in the waters of many different genres, but this diversity seems somewhat contrived. It also diminishes the overall cohesion of the album. I still enjoy his singing and generally find the lyrical content on &quot;Diamonds&quot; to work well, but his composition seems diluted at some points and riddled with affectations at others. There are definitely worthwhile tunes on this album, but as a whole I don't find it as compelling, sincere, or heartfelt as &quot;Fight For Your Mind&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Cruel World.&quot;
B000065BPB|5.0|Sennheiser HD-280 Pro is an awesome headphone. I researched quite a lot (even listened to many headphones) before buying this. The HD-280 headphone is much better than its sony, panasonic equivalents (even some of the costlier models). Sony has too much bass and the sounds starts to deteriorate in upper frequencies. Panasonic has very weak bass. Comparing this with those systems, I would say it is very stable, and consistent. With hiphop, rap, jazz, it sounds perfect. Wont blow your ears! I especially LOVE the fine distinction in sounds at all frequencies. You can hear ALL instruments used in the music. Drums, etc are very distinct. When you go up in the frequencies, it is very smooth unlike Sony. You can perfectly hear the finer parts of classical music. Plus, the noise cancellation feature is awesome. I no more hear babies crying around me in planes, annoying teenage girls shouting in coffee houses.. :) I just love my HD-280 Pro headphone.
0517053616|3.0|I originally bought this book used and later discovered that this was the ideal situation. It is handy to have all of Shakespeare's works (plays and sonnets) under one cover, but there are several drawbacks. Each page is split into two columns, causing the plays to be read like a newspaper. Since linebreaks are important in Shakespeare (remember the iambic pentameter), some lines are too long for the margins, causing the remaining words to hover like ghosts away from the sentence.<br />Also, this book contains no footnotes. This is mainly how buying the individual play is superior to the collected works. Olde English isn't always intuitive, and this particular book leaves you to find out a word's meaning for yourself.<br />But this book certainly looks pretty on your shelf. :)
B00006L7XQ|5.0|The man faces his mortality.  Johnny Cash addresses life, sorrow, redemption, and death in these recordings.  Somehow he does it in a more compelling fashion than any other album I've ever listened to.  Death is the destiny of all of us; it inspires fear, dread, sadness, and somtimes, hope.  It is ugly, doesn't discriminate, and is as certain as birth.  When Mr. Cash sings about it, death's reality is palpable, its finality seems even more permanent.  Yet, at the same time a thread of hope is glimpsed along the way.  The Man's faith in Jesus Christ adds mystery and even a bit of anticiption?  This disc makes me think, and it makes me feel even more.
0385504209|3.0|Strong start to this book, but it definately tails off towards the end. Brown's secret society speculation is fascinating and the book is a page turner almost all the way through. But aside from some of the interesting tidbits the author throws in, the story itself is weak at best and annoyingly bad at worst. That said, I was fascinated by Browns discussion of religion. I guess I would have given this book one more star if not for the excess of praise heaped upon it by other reviewers and it's seemingly endless spot atop the best seller list. Thus, I deny it 1 star in protest...
0385504209|2.0|If you enjoy well written books that completely pull you into the story, then &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is not for you. After reading this book (it was a Christmas gift) I was astounded to hear that it's a best seller. As a fledgling writer myself, I was surprised to read so many novice writing errors in this supposed &quot;professional&quot; piece.<br />&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a large push of pseudo-historical facts and suspence, but Brown fails in making his characters feel human. During the course of their two day quest, they do not stop to eat, sleep, or even use the restroom. There isn't even a comment on how the characters feel about the lack of these necessities. (No tiredness, no stomach growls, nothing.) Brown is so wrapped up in trying to make a good story that he forgets to make believable characters.<br />When the bad guy was finally given an actual name instead of just &quot;the teacher,&quot; I was completely disappointed. I actually didn't believe the antagonist was really who he said he was for several chapters. Why didn't I believe it? There is a blaringly obvious plot hole that Brown forgot to cover up, which prevents his antagnoist from being who he says he is. It's simply impossible.<br />Oh, and the chapter lengths are just amusing. Apparently Brown doesn't know how to transition between scenes without making a new chapter. In this 454 page book, there are 106 chapters. (I'm calling the epilogue a chapter because it is.) This means each chapter is roughly 4 pages long. If this were an elementary book, I wouldn't be surprised at the short chapter lengths. But as a work of fiction for adults, I expect the author to learn how to transition scenes without making new chapters each time.<br />Personally, I think I might have enjoyed this book if Brown had set it up as a simple historical mystery.  The cross-country chases and multiple gun-point standoffs quickly become tiresome and boring. The historical research is interesting, but &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; utterly fails as a good suspense novel.t;The Da Vinci Code&quot; utterly fails as a good suspense novel.
B0000640VO|5.0|Where to begin with this brilliant film.  Amelie is not just a love story. It's the story of hope, faith, and restored passion for life.  As a young girl, Amelie lives in a fantasy world with no friends and cold, unfeeling parents.  She grows up and becomes a creative and unique, but shy and lonely woman, who ultimately wants to do good for others and yet lacks the skills she needs to create happiness in her own life.  She is sweet, selfless, and unbelievably adorable as portrayed by Audrey Tautou.  <br />The film ties the lives of several lost souls to each other and to Amelie and shows how one person's small acts of kindness and sometimes cruelty help people find truth and finally contentment in their lives.  <br />To top it all off, the film is visually stunning.  The colors (greens, reds, blues) and cinematography alone make this film a must see!  I can't say enough good things about it. It will make you weep and leave your heart full.  A true feel-good movie that is never cheesy or trite.  Rent it on DVD and see the director talk about the making of the film, and you'll be just as impressed as if you had seen it in the theater.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I saw this on TNT in 1994, finally was able to buy the VHS and only recently (thank God!!!) the DVD.  Well, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie!!!--Wouldn't change a thing and don't believe there is any waste of film.  While I did find Binoche's accent a trifle disconcerting at times--it was easily overlooked by the sheer power of her performance. Fine, fine Fiennes--probably not a lot of people know this--but Steven Spielberg picked Fiennes to star in Schindler's List as the German officer Amon Goeth after witnessing the brutality he brought to the role of Healthcliff.  I love this movie and am privileged to own the soundtrack on CD by Sakamoto.  It is a very haunting movie, haunting music, absolutely POWERFUL performances.  I recommend this.  IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES AND I AM SO GLAD TO OWN IT NOW ON DVD!!!!!!!
0590353403|5.0|How would it make you feel if you lived under the stairs and had no friends?  How would you feel if your parents died and you were sent to live with your aunt and uncle who lie to you about your parents past?  Finally, how would you feel if a man you had never seen before show up on your birthday and told you every secret that your aunt and uncle have been keeping from you?  This is the enchanting story of a boy who lost his parents due to an evil wizard and is sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to become a great wizard and uncover his past.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone is an excellent book and a great read for everyone, even if you hate to read.  J.K. Rowlings ability to keep the reader interested and guessing is amazing.  She has the ability to tell great stories that will interest all age levels.  I have not come across one person who has read this book and not fallen in love with it.  It is a fast read and the pages will seem to fly by.  If you read one book in your lifetime make it Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone.
B0000JCFPE|1.0|The fact that the selling point for this movie is Stone's sex scenes, says it all.  Good thing she is attractive, because she can't act.  Then again, who could act with a script this predictable and at times hysterical.  Dialogue is so bad here you won't believe it.  And Micahel Douglas phones in his usual angry-white-guy preformance - really he has to be one of the most limited actors out there.<br />Anyways, this movie is a dog and watch some Ginger Lynn lingere videos if you want to see some steamy scenes.  Stay away, far far away.
B00005JMGL|5.0|this is the best movie i ever saw. its probably cuz jeremy was in it and hes sooooooooo cute and talented. i just wish that i could meet him someday, but i guess thats every girls dream. well bac 2 the movie....<BR>there was so much action in it and i think that it would be really cool if u made a second one where peter comes back and wendy's all grown up so peter takes her daughter to neverland so that she can enjoy the beautiful wonders there. if u ever do that then please call me. i really would luv to be in a movie with jeremy.<br />thanx a lot
B0000028UK|4.0|If you don't know, this is the follow up to 1991's TEN, the best album Pearl Jam would ever do, and they knew this, so instead of trying to copy the formula behind their first album (straight ahead, pure, solid, han banging grunge) to secure a sucessful follow up, they decided to write songs that sounded nothing like their debut. The album starts with Go and Animal.  Both are songs that will eventually het stuck in your head, eventually being the key.  Daughter is much softer then the album openers.  it was the lead off single for Pearl Jam.  It is one of their top 10 best.  You WILL love this song, and as a matter of fact, as you start listenig to the samples of the songs above, you will wonder if the album is worth buying if this is the best song, but this is only because the rest of the songs take a while to get in to. trust me.  I came across this album a year ago, and am still listening to it once a week. the songs after this are dissident and glorified g.  both you will find stuck in your head after you lsiten to daughter to much. of the two glorified g is my favorite, and as a matter of fact, glorified g has become my favorite on the album.  the sixth track is good, creepy and strange, but good.  the rest of the tracks are good, you'll like them, but the only other track bast teh first six you will find yourself always skipping to is elderly woman behind the counter(or whatever it is).  it is soft, sweet, and certainly a sing along. This album is very good, consistent, and probably the second best pearl jam album.  I personally recommend it to anyone who likes pearl jam, and doesn't mind singing to them instead  of head banging.  I would rate ir higher, but I can't give it four and a half, and because of the greatness of ten, and their best songs being on vitalogy, i can only give it a four.
B000002GA8|2.0|Love the music, but this particular release is poorly mastered for CD.  Do yourself a favor, and pay more for the Japanese 24 bit remastered versions released this past Fall '03.  Not only is the sound quality far superior, but it is packaged in a replica mini-Lp, complete with insert booklet.  I purchased just the first three (Wives/Centre/MythsLegends), but practically, if not all, of the A&amp;M catalog was re-released with 24bit remastering in Japan.   Why Universal record company in the US can't get their act together and release these here is beyond understanding.  Too busy prosecuting kids who download, I suppose.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Perhaps my opinion may differ greatly to others, but I feel as though these supposed 'hip' bands of today (e.g. The White Stripes and The Strokes) are overtly trying to emulate bands of the 1960's and 1980's ( the former and latter, respectively -- is it just me but do the WS sound like The Doors?!). I have to admit that I am entertained by them, but I just find them strikingly unoriginal, and in some cases, a little bland. On the positive side, The WS's 'Seven Nation Army' has a truely infectious beat to it- which is what brought me to their attention, plus it evokes a certain nostalgia of 1960's rock. All in all, The White Stripes ARE an interesting group...
0385504209|2.0|I enjoy thrillers, and have more than a passing interest in history and theology. But this book was tough to finish -- the writing is pedestrian at best, and truly awful in places. Clich&eacute;s abound. I'm a technical writer, and it disturbs me that such a poorly-written book has ascended to the top of the best-seller lists.
0385504209|1.0|It appears that this book was on the Christmas list of some very intelligent people with great taste.  Let me add my disapointment to the chorus.  Unremarkable writing, wooden characters, stilted dialogue and dubious &quot;research&quot; makes for one very forgettable novel.
B0000DBJDM|2.0|i got this as a gift and i was extremely excited, as Floyd has always been one of my favorite bands and i hadn't seen this movie in a few years (and not ever on DVD). The original film is amazing - clips of the band performing some of their best songs from the pre-&quot;Dark Side&quot; era (Echoes, Saucerful of Secrets, Careful With That Axe Eugene, etc) at the ruins on Pompeii, interspersed with clips of the ruins and lava; there are also some good interviews and studio footage.<BR>So I popped it in, thinking that &quot;director's cut&quot; meant maybe a little added footage in the studio, an extra interview. But NO!! The Director's Cut has all this ridiculous computer-animated outer space footage and slow motion clips of the band members in the studio spliced in over parts of the original movie - giving it a decidely modern feel (read: MTV/VH1 editing style) that, in my opinion, completely ruins the film. This could be forgiven if the original film was also on the DVD in its intact form, but the &quot;Original Concert&quot; in the special features is the performances only, with none of the interviews or studio footage from the original film. To get to those, you have to go back to the &quot;director's cut&quot; and scan backwards from the beginning of whatever chapter is after the interview - you can't directly access the interview at all. <br />Basically, this seems like director Adrien Maben's attempt to make some $$$ - he knows that hardcore Floyd fans will buy this absurd regurgitation of what was once a great concert film. My recommendation, buy the VHS on E-bay. This DVD strips the charm right out of Pompeii.
B000089CJI|5.0|Wowwy wow wow. this is just plain good, is all. Found them because I liked the &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; disc from Death Cab for Cutie so darn much, but I like this even better. It is different, obviously more electronic but it just works so well. Wonderful collaboration.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow!  My husband trid to get me to watch this while it was on the air, but I was a pregnat full-tim college student working two jobs, and I just could't stay awake through the bad tv recetion.

0446677450|1.0|This fellow makes Standard Oil look tame. Kiyosaki grew up in priviliage in Hawaii and tries to convince the reader that anyone who works for a living including those that have companies (like me) are wrong if they are getting their hands dirty.<br />Its a new blend of Capitalism with a touch of nazism and darwinism. He thinks that there are two classes of people out there haves and have nots (dead flesh). Worker bees and people that feed off of worker bees.

It also helps him profit in his ventures, but in his small moronic model of the world there are smart dads and poor ones (that are educated and contribute to society).

B0000C7GG2|5.0|It really is a shame when one of the best albums of 2003 is not even released in America due to the band being constantly ignored on these shores, but this is exactly the case with Muse's third studio album, Absolution. From the beginning piano crush of \\"Apocalypse Please\\" to the final moments of the quieter closing track \\"Ruled by Secrely,\\" Muse shows their true power as musicians and songwriters. Matthew Bellamy may sound like a more articulate Thom Yorke in his vocal style, but that does not in any way dull their impact on this album. <br />Songs like \\"Time is Running Out,\\" \\"Hysteria\\" and the sensational \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" show off what Muse can accomplish when Matthew, Chris and Dominic are perfectly in sync with each other. Granted, there are two filler tracks (\\"Intro\\" and \\"Interlude\\"), but every other song is a keeper. The chorus of \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" soars with some of the most affecting harmony I've heard in a long time; I still get chills every time I hear it. \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" is broken up by a beautiful piano interlude before launching back into pounding drums and Matthew's vocal assault, while \\"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist\\" is excellent in both lyrical content and musical structure. The true gem on the disc, however, is the track \\"Sing for Absolution.\\" It's slower and piano dominated than the rest of the hard rock found on the album, more of a ballad piece, but it shows off the true beauty of Matthew's voice along with his true lyrical skill. Every track is a winner, but \\"Sing for Absolution\\" is above and beyond the rest.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Many reviews of this movie have declared it as trash, a movie without any sort of values, which is totally crazy.  Quentin Tarentino set out to make an exciting, fast-paced, gripping, violent Kung-Fu movie, and he totally succeeds.  The acting is careful and fun, the sets in the movie are almost cartoony, as well is the violence.  If the violence is too offensive for people, they shouldn't see it, but if you watch the violence in the movie AS the art of the movie, you've got yourself an art picture.  The plot is simple, but that doesn't make it dumb.  The music that is integrated throughout the picture, with the help of the Wu-Tang's clan the RZA, sets such a desolate and artificial tone, that the movie never really feels like it is set in the real world, which is perfect for it.  I love this movie, and any critic who refers to it as trash, namely Anthony Lane of the New Yorker, has absolutely no sense of humor, which is too bad, for he missed out on a great, fun movie.
B00008BXJF|5.0|The Power to Believe is easily the best album released in 2003, and a welcome return to form for the Krims after the odd and somewhat disappointing ConstruKction of Light. The current lineup of Robert Fripp (Guitar, Mellotron), Adrian Belew (Guitar, Vocals), Trey Gunn (Warr Guitar) and Pat Mastroletto (Percussion) seem to finally be more at home with each other after the departure of Tony Levin and Bill Bruford. If anyone could ever truly replace Tony and Bill, Pat and Trey are probably the only conceivable choices. Pat's drumming is on par with Bill's, though it lacks the true fire and passion heard from Bill's earlier Krim work. Hearing Trey work his Warr Guitar is a beauty to behold (all the more reason to pick up their two excellent live DVDs), and while he definitely lacks the punch of Chapman Stick maestro Tony Levin (we won't be hearing another \\"Elephant Talk\\" for a while), he is skilled in a very different and just as competent way. <br />The album begins with the first of the \\"Power to Believe\\" suite, simply consisting of Adrian's heavily processed voice speaking the only lyrics to all four parts:<br />\\"She carries me through days of apathy<BR>She watches over me<BR>She saved my life in a manner of speaking<BR>When she gave me back The Power to Believe\\" <br />Sounds uplifting, right? Well, once you listen to the next track (and best of the album), the rollicking instrumental \\"Level Five,\\" you come to realize that this is the same Crimson that was able to release such punishing albums as Red and THRAK. \\"Level Five\\" is almost completely minor in chord progression and structure, and features the same great interplay between Adrian and Robert since Discipline. It features a thrilling middle section of extreme beautiful dissonance, and is the most powerful song they've released since \\"Red.\\" It is immediately followed by \\"Eyes Wide Open,\\" a song basically designed for Adrian that shows off his vocal chops. \\"Elektrik\\" is another excellent Crimson instrumental.<br/>\\"Facts of Life\\" seems to put off most of my immediate family (all Crimson fans), but I do still like it. It's the weakest song of the album, somewhat formulaic while retaining some sense of Crimson weirdness. The chorus is excellent; I wish I could say the same for the verses. It is followed by the second incarnation of \\"The Power to Believe,\\" another solid instrumental.<br />\\"Dangerous Curves\\" picks up steam, a slow sizzler of a song that builds in intensity until it reaches its apex of power, preparing the listener for the sonic assault that is \\"Happy With What You Have to Be Happy With,\\" which features some of the best lyrics of Adrian's Krim career. It's formulaic songwriting outside of the wild bridge/reprise that once again shows off the Krims' desire to simply throw meter and downbeats out the window. <br />The disc ends with \\"The Power to Believe\\" parts three and four, two more instrumentals. Both are excellent mood pieces in stark contrast to \\"Happy.\\" In the end, The Power to Believe is simply that, an album of contrasts, and a beautiful one at that. King Crimson is back in all its glory.
0312263120|1.0|This book is really an insult to those who has a brain. What can I say? I definitely would not buy into the author's the other hype: the &quot;D.V. Code&quot;.<br />The plot in this story is so dull and plain, you almost predict it from the beginning: when Susan Fletcher (the main character) over and over agin mentioned at the beginning that there are no &quot;unbreakable code&quot;, you almost immediately suspect whatever is running in that TRANSLTR machine is just a decoy for &quot;unbreakable code&quot;, and the true purpose was to implant virus.  GUESS WHAT? THAT WAS THE WHOLE PLOT of the book! How disappointed it is!<br />Also, the love story and David Becker's journey in Spain to successfully retrieve the ring was so irrelevant to the plot and so dull, you have to be a real idiot to believe it is remotely possible.<br />Needless to say, as other reviewers pointed out, the mistakes author made regarding computer technology are too many. <br />Save your time and money!
B000089RVR|2.0|My God, what happened to Dido? I love No Angel to death but I can't bear listening to this CD. Gone are the mesmerizing rhythms found in Don't Think of Me and I'm No Angel. Every song on here is the exact same. It's as if she's speaking with some (entirely too heavy) background beats humming along. There are no ups and downs to her voice. If it wasn't for the fact that words are spoken at different speeds, you can imagine her chanting the lyrics. I can't believe this is Dido has to offer after these years. Hopefully her next album is better. I will be waiting.
B0000AQZYM|4.0|Great film for the kids1  Parents who have seen other Disney films will find that it is the same thing that has been done several times.  With animal characters that think like humans and can perform tricks that no animals can do!  Yet it is still appealing, especially if you are familiar with the actors that voice the characters.
0316666343|5.0|There is something different about how this author writes-every word is so perfect and really gets into your soul. This was a very well written book. It didn't end the way I wanted it to, but then I realized that it's LIFE..life isn't supposed to always have fairy tale endings. This is definitely one of my favorites!
B0000D14JV|4.0|A much better version than the original.  As good a performance as Jamie Lee Curtis gives, the young actress who plays her daughter is phenominal and convincing.  Some very hilarious moments especially when the daughter must sit with her mother's paranoid psychiatric patients and listen to them while giving a bored teenager's attitude.<br />I saw this with my young son and we both highly enjoyed it!<br />Great music too!
B0000242CG|3.0|I know this is the album that really sent Dire Straits on their way to their greatest commercial success, but from someone who has been a Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fan from the start I would rate this as pretty average, far from their best. Money for Nothing and Walk of Life are good but on the whole the album is not as strong as others such as their first album titled Dire Straits, Making Movies, Alchemy (live album) and Love Over Gold.
B0000AGQ6Z|5.0|This is the first Superbit DVD I ever bought. It's amazing, I still can not believe my eyes. I will not write about the movie itself, if you know your classics, then you will know what it is all about. This Superbit quality makes all the difference: sharp as a razorblade, perfect sound, this is the way a film should look like. Believe me, I used to be a projectionist. If you think 'normal' DVD's are great, you never saw a film in Superbit quality. Every movie should be available in Superbit.
B00000IBE2|2.0|If all you know of Dire Straits is their &quot;Best Of&quot; you are really missing the best of Dire Straits and the incredible songwriting and guitar of Mark Knopfler.  Avoid this mainstream offering and get the albums.  Start off with Making Movies, their self titled Dire Straits and/or the live album Alchemy.
B00003CXE7|3.0|When I first saw this film.  I just did not like it.  I wasn't in the right mood.  I throughly enjoyed Russell Crowe in L.A. [[ASIN:B001CN2WXM L.A. Confidential (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] (1997) where I first saw Crowe.  I had to see him in more movies.  Then I saw him in [[ASIN:B000066AXE A Beautiful Mind (Full Screen Awards Edition)]] (2001). He should have won the Academy Award for his performance, but he did not.  He was only nominated, but that is still an honor too.  Since then, I have seen Crowe in  [[ASIN:B0002XNT12 Proof]] (1991), [[ASIN:B00004Z1FL Hammers over the Anvil]] (1991), [[ASIN:B00008R9KG The Sum of Us]] (1994) and [[ASIN:B00003CWRX The Insider]] (1999).  I had to give Gladiator (2000) one more try.  Their was the scenes where the tiger almost got Russell Crowe in real-life.  They left that scene in there.  The scenes with the tiger was an eye-opener.  Crowe being shackled was memorable.    Actor Oliver Reed, [[ASIN:B00000K3TV Tommy]] (1975), died during production of this film. He was arm wrestling in a bar, heavily intoxicated. he had a sudden heart attack on May 2, 1999. They had to use CGI effects of his face and a body double to finish filming scenes.
B00000IHE1|5.0|I am a real Dire Straits/Mark Knopler fanatic and while Dire Straits have produced some great albums I would rate this as their best.  Excellent songwriting and musicianship (what a great guitarist).  Knopfler is at his height as a songwriter on this one.  Tunnel of Love and Romeo and Juliete have to be two of the best songs he has written but every song on here is fantastic.  Even Les Boys which at first I felt was a bit of a throwaway piece has really grown on me.  From a died in the wool Dire Straits fan, if you like like DS and don't have this album don't hesitate, get it now.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is a must have for all those who love The Lord of the Rings.<BR>This set goes in to so much more depth then the original version.<BR>Excellent special features and interviews as well.<br />One should take care not to compare the books and movies...they are each very good in their own right. :)
B0000242CE|5.0|Listening to Knopler's guitar work on a studio album sends chills, he is amazing.  The only thing better is hearing him live.  Alchemy is a fantastic live album.  What he does live on Sultans of Swing and Telegraph Road alone is worth it, but the whole damn thing is great.  If you are a Dire Straits fan this is essential.
B0000025ZF|4.0|I really like this and I am not a fan of Rogers.  Don't expect great songs here, the title track might be the only real song here and its the weakest on the album - but it is a commerical overture that seems to achieve the goal of leading to the close of the album.  Clearly meant to be heard start to finish, I like the trip, and music moves well, the sax and Clapton's sparse guitar rifs fill in the beauty of the picture being painted here.  Reading the other reviews I realize the story that plays in my head may not be exactly what its supposed to be! Oh well!  I like the roadtrip the album takes me on.
B00000INM1|5.0|I first heard Sultans of Swing when it first came out on my car radio and couldn't figure out for the longest time who it was, darn DJ never said when it was over.  I tracked it down and immediately bought the album and I have been a Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fanatic since.  One of my all-time favourite guitarists, he can play a mile a minute or slow and sweet.  I have pretty well every album Knopler has produced with DS or solo and I have to say this is one of my absolute favorites, definitley rate it ahead of Brothers in Arms (the one that set them off on commercial success).  Sultan's of Swing is the hit from the album but every song is good (Down to the Waterline is my personal favorite).
0061015725|1.0|This is a great example of how celebrity writers milk the cash cow by producing endless pap that rides on the coattails of past successful undertakings.  This book is so bad!  The characters are not fleshed out (ha-ha, pun intended!) to any great extent, and the plot eventually borders on the laughably absurd.  I almost chucked it into the trash about half-way through, but then decided to see if it could get worse.  Yes, it could and it did!  Pass this woofer by!
B00008DDHZ|5.0|Many who watch this film may think that the IRA made it. The truth is that it is a British movie. If you do not know what Blood Sunday is then allow me to explain. On January 30th, 1972 - Catholic Irish demonstrators took to the streets of Derry in Northern Ireland for a peaceful march. On the lanes they where met by the British army who had set up barricades to keep them moving in a certain direction and away from the Protestant areas of the city. At one point some demonstrators broke away from the main group and began to attack a police barricade. Shots where heard and the army moved in with high velocity armed paratroopers turning the whole demonstration into a war zone. Innocent people where shot and killed. Some may even have been executed. The whole scene was like something out of a nightmare with British soldiers moving along the streets in uniform motion taking pot shots at what they believed to be armed IRA members. Whether or not armed IRA members where there the British army somehow managed to kill a lot of innocent people in the process and a cover-up followed to protect leading political figures - for example: How did some soliders fire more rounds than they where allocated? How did some innocent people who where shot dead end up with weapons in their pockets \\"after\\" the British army gathered them up? Who gave the order for the paratroopers to operate in the way that they did and why did groups of paratroopers go rogue and not respond to their chief in command?<br />Bloody Sunday plays out like Saving Private Ryan with Irish catholic civilians on the receiving end instead of Nazis. It is mostly one big \\"action\\" film that could also be compared to the likes of Black Hawk Down for its urban setting. All of the cast are functional and the film does grip you and at times is extremely violent and harrowing especially when innocent people are getting shot up. This is an urban nightmare of a war film. You should try to see it. It will certainly take you by surprise and is very well produced.<br />It is not a film that you will enjoy but you will be very glad that you watched it to know a little more about the historical conflict in Northern Ireland. This film depicts a very REAL event that happened and looks as real as it did then.<br />Excellent production.prise and is very well produced.<br />It is not a film that you will enjoy but you will be very glad that you watched it to know a little more about the historical conflict in Northern Ireland.

B00000K3D4|5.0|I have watched this film over and over and i still havent got bored of it! It really has to be one of the best fantasy films ever, the casting couldnt have been better and the puppets are so imaginative! It really goes to show that they dont make films like they used to!
B00006LPER|5.0|Forget about reading into any meaning that you think this film may offer. The director is known as just a person who likes to mess with your brains. Anyone who has seen his previous works will snap this one up in an instant. Those who enjoy this movie will likely try his other fine beverages for the head.<br />Basically the protagonist, a sexually insane music teacher, is as mad as bag of hammers yet manages to stay somewhat somber in her profession because she fits in with the rest of the snobs, but deep inside she is totally and completely bananas with a surreal sized suppressed sexual appetite to boot. So she walks the music halls with his lemon sucking expression among all the other lemon suckers who are sucking their lemons for very different reasons to hers and for this reason nobody really knows who or what she is like.<br />When a music student falls head over heels in love with her they set out on a voyage of absolute debauchery in every nock and cranny that they can do it in. However his love of her is totally blind to her madness. He perceives her sadomasochism as an extension of her frustration when in fact that it just another major part of her psychosis. As they delve around with each other (sometimes very violently) the viewer begins to understand that this is really just a very sick woman who needs treatment fast and yet the world she works in and her lover can not identify it. In fact many viewers will fail to grasp that the main character is crazy until the very last scene which drives the message home like a knife to the heart.<br />This is great art-house cinema and as an insane movie ranks up there with the best of them. Some of the [] scenes are very close to X-rated material and certainly many viewers will be put off by that and the heavy amounts of violence that are sometimes on display. In short, this is a great movie about insanity, love and professionalism rolled into one. The characters in this movie are unique and the film is certainly deserving of the acclaim it received.<br />Challenging.eserving of the acclaim it received.<br />Challenging.
B000002KO3|5.0|You notice how so many reviews say &quot;the best&quot;? Well it's true. This album is a masterpiece. This is the album where Brian Eno hits his peak, and his genius is evident throughout. Not to short change the rest of the band, but it really is Eno's album. In retrospect you can see how this album heralded the whole electronica movement, perhaps even more so than early Kraftwerk. Most of these songs can still hold their own on today's dance floors, and the ones that can't are damn fine to chill to.<br />Buy this album. Play it over and over again. Marvel at Adrian Beleu's guitar solos, David Byrne's quirky and poignant lyrics, and Eno's masterful orchestration of it all.
B000001FS3|1.0|&quot;greatest album of all-time.&quot; &quot;most soulful band of all time.&quot; blah blah blah. all i can say in response to the idiotic hype around this band is a simple:no. they WISH they could have been the clash. Bono's a joke. sure, they HAD a message, what happened to it now? lost it on the way to the bank i suppose.
0780626966|5.0|People like to diss freddy and say jason and mike are better but whatever. Friday the 13th series fun to watch but it's just like watching the same movie over and over again. Mike well the story is screwed up I thought mike was trying to kill off his blood line but  7 8 don't fallow the story much. Nightmare on elm street had a fun series and might have some flaws but kept with the story. I don't know what I'm trying to say but this set is the reason i bought a dvd player. Greatest set ever buy now don't wait, tell your mom to buy it for you if your broke!
086140324X|5.0|As everyone knows, the &quot;color of magic&quot; is octarine -- the eighth color in the spectrum, visible only to wizards, like Rincewind of Ankh-Morpork, who's pretty much a failure at his profession (having been mentally invaded at school by one of the Eight Great Spells, which chased all the others out of his head), but who does show a talent for survival. Good thing, too, because the Discworld (which is supported by four great elephants standing on the back of a gigantic sea turtle) is not an easy place to survive in. Then there's Twoflower, a tourist from the Counterweight Continent, possessed of more gold than is good for him (or for anyone else) and a rather vicious piece of ambulatory luggage, whose chances of survival appear rather slim until Rincewind takes on a job as his guide. Pratchett is smack in the best tradition of britcom and any fan of Monty Python and Douglas Adams will be right at home with the author's droll style and witty turns of classic characters. But Pratchett is not only a master of literate parody but a very inventive and original creator of comic fantasy. You probably won't want to read a whole bunch of the books in this series one right after another, though. Rather, treat these tales as you would a box of expensive chocolates, parceling them out gradually and chewing slowly.
B0000A1RJI|2.0|Pirates has an exciting score to it, and at points it can really get your heart pumping. There are some problems though.<br />Audio Production<BR>Whoever mastered the tracks is in need of some serious lessons in live recording. It seems rushed through engineering. Peak levels will distort the sound at some points to mush. I am surprised that a master CD could be so low quality. I've heard better bootleg CD's. (A pirate joke, har, har!) <br />If you listen real close in the first track, and then in one of the later ones (6 or 7, I think) there's either a metronome going or some light synth. Whatever it is, it's completely out of time. I would bring the orchestra back in and rerecord several points. Then again, there's a strong possibility that Gigastudio and several other software synthesizers were used for some of the tracks. Brass is very tinny at points and unexpressive.<br />My last note on Audio production: Tracks. Very badly separated. A descrescendoing note of the end of a song cuts off halfway, the next track loads, and the decrescendo continues. It makes for a really messy cut. Though difficult with a continuous score, there are ways to get around this.<BR>They could be named better too.<br />SCORE<BR>Points are great, but orchestrastions are too direct and transitions are too sloppy. I swear I've heard parts of the score in other places before, which may be the case, since Mediaventures is essentially a giant think-tank blender, scoring several movies at once. <br />Phrasing and articulations are pretty bad. I prefer more legato playing, and in places such as the Jack's entering fanfare, a slur or at least legato tounging seems more natural to me on the line. It doesn't seem like the orchestra is in full agreement on articulations.<br />I don't know if the track was normalized, but dynamic levels are much too constant throughout most of the score.<br />The solo cello work is excellent on a good note. I wish more of its melody was in the score. <br />On theBlack Pearl Pirate's horror sequences, I could do without the moans. They are not part of the music!<br />In conclusion, it's a nice piece of work to listen to a few times. The themes (even if they are copycats) are active and background lines add to it. I bought the CD and do not regret it, but Badelt and his team need to crank up the effort. The score to Time Machine was much, much more impressive.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this DVD! I saw some reviews that said the color was bad and that they had to adjust their television sets, but I had no problems, the color was perfect. Also there are no subtitles on the DVD as an option, but if you turn the closed captioning on from your television, it has the subtitles there. It is 5 hours long, and absolutely wonderful, plus the price difference compared to the VHS version is another huge bonus. I bought mine from Digital Eyes, which is one of the companies that you find when you choose Used or New, and it was only around $20 from them brand new. Buy it! You'll Love It!
B00005MAM2|4.0|What can I say? <BR>I've loved this movie since I was seven and it saddens me to see it so changed. <BR>The new voice actors are weak and, of course, the script was edited not only for clarity but for censorship. <BR>But please, all the Akira diehards know that three peanuts equal a handful of red bennies.
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic is an album that needs no introduction. Nas' interpretation of what Hip-Hop was was a vision that was unmistakably original and incredibly well rapped. His lyrics were stellar, his subject matter was underground and contained some of the most honest and introspective lyrics I've ever heard and the production was some of the best that the Hip-Hop world in general had ever heard. There was no doubt that Nas' debut album was going to be a classic, even before it hit shelves. There was something about this, Nas' debut album, that's better than nearly any other Hip-Hop album on the market today. It was, quite simply, the fact that Nas had something to say. Whether it be describing his life, questioning his own existence, rapping street narratives or providing us with a plethora of street poetry, Nas was one of the world's most gifted lyrics and ten tracks of near perfection prove it. Although Nas would eventually sell-out on the ill-fated I Am... in 1999 and Nastradamus within the same year, Stillmatic renewed his street credibility as a street poet rather than a Pop rapper. But, no matter who you are, it's hard not to thank Nas for coming with something this original, hard-hitting and as brutally honest as Illmatic. Without a doubt, this is one of, if not the best, Hip-Hop album of all time. <BR>One
B0000DD7LC|2.0|Compared to her fist album, this one is a piece of crap.  This album makes millie vanilly look like a masterpiece. I'm really disappointed,and pissed off i wan't my money back. (p.s. don't buy this crap)
B00000K0T8|5.0|Ghostface Killah is the most influential lyricist that the Wu-Tang Clan has in their verbal arsenal. I bought this album because out of all the Wu-Tang Clan members, Ghostface Killah has brought all listeners to a new and adventurous chamber. <BR>Nobody has ever seen this style of lyricism before. Ever since I heard him on the Wu-Tang's opus, &quot;Enter The 36 Chamber&quot;, I always knew that Ghostface Killah was an unusual and unique force not to be reckoned with. Some of the words that he says might not make sense, but they do come in the light after a few listens. I may not <BR>get the message that he is implying when he speaks, but the picture becomes more clear. For example, on songs such as &quot;Wildflower&quot; which has a derrogitory verbal barrage on an ex-girlfriend, left a giant impression on me as to what kind of woman she really was.<BR>This album has cameo appearances from Cappadonna, Inspectah Deck, Masta Killah, Raekwon and The Rza. To me this album had it all. It was like a &quot;Ghetto Hymnal.&quot; The best song that was on the LP (and I'm sure that everyone would agree), has to be,&quot;All That I Have Is You.&quot; Ghostface Killah really outdid himself on this song. The words that were depicted, painted a picture of the troubled times that Ghostface had endured in his youth in the projects. This song alone has enough feeling to make any rugged, grown man cry. With Mary J.Blige on vocals, it actually made you think that you were in the first pew of church. <BR>It made you think about all the bad times growing up in poverty or depression and makes you realize that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Overall, I think that Ghostface Killah's &quot;Ironman&quot; is the beginning to something enjoyable to all that listens to it. Although Ghostface's style is similar to his fellow Wu-Tang brethren, member Raekwon, Ghost brings something extra to the table. If anyone chooses to pick this album up in the stores, I strongly recommend that you pick up Raekwon's, &quot;Only Built For Cuban Linx&quot;. This album happens to be a &quot;door-opening&quot; prelude to &quot;Ironman&quot;.<BR>Definitely a must have.<BR>One
B000000OPW|4.0|The 3rd best Siouxsie brew (after &quot;Anima, Animus&quot; and &quot;Superstition&quot;). Melodic and macbre, she does a fine job of conquering quesy subjects and complex arrangements. Only reason it gets a 4/5 is the pretentious anti-drug rant, &quot;Candyman.&quot; Best cuts are easily the hummable &quot;The Sweetest Chill&quot; (about longing a loved one) and the spoken-word horror, &quot;The Execution,&quot; which reminds one of Belly's great song, &quot;Slow Dog,&quot; about a woman punished by carrying a dead dog on her back.

B00008G9JN|5.0|I had this release in 8 track and vinyl (I am dating myself) and waited for it to be released to CD for a long time. It is a great album, as all Tull music is, it is different and that is what makes it so special. It has wonderful orchestrations and the ability to bring you to another place and time. I see it as the soundtrack to Monty Python's Jabberwocky or Holy Grail. It fits the time perfectly.
B00005JM0B|3.0|Terminator-3 eventually comes out. Like everybody else, I have been waiting for this movie over 10 years long. But.....a bit disappointed.<BR>I purposely re-wateched the previous two termintor movies to refresh myself before going for the brand new exciting T3. Probably the new one is done by a different director and actors, it's not hard to sense the difference of the tone and style in T3. It seems missing some depth of the complex relationship between human &amp; machine. The plot is abit rough &amp; sloppy. The chasing scene is expensive but not thrill &amp; breath-taking as T2 and the one on highway in Matrix Reloaded. But if you're the Arnold big fan, go for it, otherwise, don't expect too much as I did. I hope he'll be back again for T4 with some surprise.
0060245867|5.0|My seventeen-month old son will search through his vast library to find this book (and the others in this series), protesting when I try to compromise with another selection.  He loves the story, knows when to turn the page (which is no longer necessary, as I can recite them all from memory) and will accept no subsitute.  I even tried burying the books away so that I could read something new to him, but he dug them out, carried them down the stairs and insisted I drop everything to recall what are apparently his favorite stories.
B00005JM4Z|4.0|Are you looking for street racing again? <BR>You may be a bit disappointed in this second Fast &amp; Furious movie. But it is a definitely better quality and more exciting movie. 2 Fast 2 Furious obviously has a much stronger storyline without repeating the same one as the previous movie. Even missing Vin Diesel, Paul Walker still able to drive this second movie to the peak. Very good one. Cann't wait for the third one to coming out.
B00007G207|5.0|Quickly, one of my favorites of all time. The major problem with the new one is not that I have so much of an issue with the additional footage, but rather than it changes the climax of the movie from the last scene to the scene in the car, where Toto and his lover reunite. In the old version, the ending is one of the most touching moments in movie-making history.
1591391105|4.0|Great book! You don't have to be a leader, new executive, or senior manager, you may be just a new employee joining to a new company. Regardless the position you are, the ten suggested guidelines from this book still provide you a great deal of practical advice, especially the chapter of 'Negotiate Success', which addresses how you should setup and manage the expectation between you &amp; your new boss. Very helpful.
B00005B36H|5.0|There is so much to say about this album, it is so complex that the average human couldn't comprehend the meanings behind the songs and music.  First off, I disapprove of anyone who claims Maynard as being the one who made the album so amazing.  He is not to thank (by himself).  This musical geniuses behind this album are Danny Carey, Adam Jones, and Justin Chancellor.  Maynard merely provides his deep emotional voice which completes the album.  What sets Tool apart from every other band out there is basis in music.  Each song instrumentally is layered and complex with rhythms and beats.  More so on this album then previous, especially into Relfection.  The music is absolutely beautiful on each song, and the lyrics only enhance the mind when understood. I only understand each song to a degree, even after years of studying this material and the references, there is sooo much more that they understand that I do not.<BR>I will attempt a song by song analysis to the best of my understanding:<BR>The Grudge: This song refers to the people in our society that are narrow-minded and stuck into their ideas and ways.  The grudge can be taken literally, like someone who thinks negatively on another or a way of being.  The song casts down on them, telling them their faults and ignorance.  The point is to recognize the problem and maybe push us to open our minds to others and their beliefs.<br />The Patient:  The patient refers to a person, someone who is seeking treatment, not necessarily medical.  It is someone who questions their life, seeking answers and someone to heal the pain of loss, emptiness, etc.  He wonders if it is worth it, to grow and become 'well' consicously.<br />Schism:  This song references several things. Namely the tower of Bable.  From the Bible, the tower of Bable was man's design to reach 'God', in return God destroyed it and seperated man across the world and changed their languages.  The Bible uses this as an analogy for the possibility of the human species reaching the Christ Consciousness.  If everyone can come together and evolve spiritually and mentally, then we could reach higher levels.  This song pushes the idea of coming together once again; communicating, and putting the pieces back together (Bable).<br />Parabol/Parabola:  This song reflects his unity with himself and body.  &quot;This body holding me&quot; is his own body, holding his consciousness.  It's just a flow of understanding and acceptance of who he is.<br />Ticks and Leeches:  I haven't looked into this all that much, but what I can tell it is about someone who wants more then they deserve, like many a psychotic ex.?<br />Lateralus:  This gets down to the core of the album; about thinking laterally; which means thinking outside the lines, and on different levels then the norm.  &quot;Black and White are all I see in my infancy&quot; this relates to a new born child only seeing black and white, as well as the evolution of species that start by seeing black and white.  This follows into his personal evolution of the mind, to see more and more the more he learns and grows.  He explores different medians and realities and finds so much more that what is given.  The &quot;spiral&quot; is somethine used a lot in math, it can be a repeating pattern that grows bigger in mathematical terms, and here it relates to his ever-evolving and learning mind.<br />Disposition:  This is a transition song.. kind of a question..<br />Reflection:  This song is about narcicism (someone obsessed with how they look).  The reflection can refer to a mirror in which the person stares into too much.  The &quot;moon&quot; refers to astrology and how it affects our personality.  The &quot;satallite&quot; can refer to the moon, or to us (humans) as we are each satallites on earth.  He says he must crucify his ego, which means leave behind his trained mind in order to proceed forth.<br />And my friends.. the rest is up to you!  (well that's it for the songs, but each one has so much more meaning; whether you like to think or just to chill to some excellently played music)
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let's get this out of the way first. The original &quot;Let It Be&quot; is NOT one of my favorite Beatles' albums. Often sloppy and sounding more than a little piecemeal, it always seemed to be the scraps of an experiment gone wrong. What made it endearing was the fact that it included two of the band's best songs ever, and they were &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; and of course, &quot;Let It Be.&quot; So I always hung on to it, and still played it on those days when I jonesed for the aforementioned songs, as well as &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Get Back.&quot;<br />Now here we are in the starts of a new millennium, and Paul McCartney is in the middle of his purge. First the rearranging of the song writing credits on &quot;Back In The US,&quot; and now this. I hear them howling from the rooftops now, those purists who feel that their golden calf has been foisted from the rooftops where &quot;Get Back&quot; first echoed, clamoring with stakes and pitchforks, demanding that the evil be driven from the land and the recording studios.<br />My Response: Get Over Yourselves.<br />While I basically have moments on &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; that I feel are better than the original (in particular, &quot;Two Of Us&quot; and &quot;Across The Universe&quot;), I also have a few that I really didn't think made that much difference. But if you also consider that, since the late eighties, artists have been releasing remixed/remodeled albums within a year of their original release, it gives one pause. What makes anyone think for a moment that The Beatles, who were lovers of technology and studio experiments, wouldn't have indulged in multi-format versions of albums had the resources been available? Given the way the three &quot;Anthology&quot; sets, complete with posthumous &quot;new&quot; singles, were guzzled up, I suspect that alternate albums and mixes would have been enthusiastically distributed in their heyday.<br />&quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is cut from the same spiritual cloth that The Beatles draped themselves in during their illustrious career. Having Phil Spector's overlay sandblasted away is not heresy; nor is it ever going to obliterate the original album and singles from the universal psyche. I shudder to think that a Paul Oakenfeld remix album (ala the Elvis Presely singles) could be in a crystal ball someplace, but I am willing to accept the &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; album as delightful curio from a bygone era that fostered creation for the sheer joy of music. After all, this is, was, and will always be pop music for popular culture, capable of withstanding the alterations of time AND the trials of the present day.om the same spiritual cloth that The Beatles draped themselves in during their illustrious career.

0792844882|5.0|The thing that so many people seem to miss is that this film is a farce.<br />Its a giant satire on the American Dream and Las Vegas.  If any of you have seen Robocop, one of Paul Verhoeven's earlier films, you may remember the &quot;News Stories&quot; sequences, which were a hilarious incendiary post-modern mockey of the ultra violent technology driven future.  Yet Robocop was a studio film that was marketed as an action adventure.  Showgirls works the same way.  No studio would intentionally fund a big-budget mockery of America and Vegas.  You have to read between the lines people...take for example Nomi riding around in her friend's truck eating the hamburger, she takes the wrapper off and flings it off (littering) and laughs like a schoolgirl.  Why would a european filmmaker include that minor detail, hmmmm?  There's countless examples of  Showgirls being able to be read on multiple levels, making it one of the most hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable films I have seen in a long time.  Don't take it so seriously and notice the details - you'll be rewarded.
0151008116|2.0|I found this book boring. Im sorry. Yann Martel fills the book with lists of stuff instead of just writing. A third of the way through the book, I found myself hoping that it would end quickly. I know this is not a popular view of this book, but its the truth. I dont see how everyone thinks that there was some sorta incitefull meaning. I really didn't get anything from this book. The only entertaining part of this whole book was the floating island and the translation of the Japanese conversation at the end of the book.

B00008S2VG|5.0|In the run up to it's release in April 2003, it seemed the 'thing' for all journalists to break Madonna down from the pedastal they had pushed her upon after the release of 1998's groundbreaking classic 'Ray of Light' and 2000's fantastic 'Music' albums.<br />'American Life' was labelled rubbish and a call for sympathy from the undisputed queen of pop.... but let me tell you, it isn't! Ok, a far cry maybe from the genius of 'Ray of Light' but 'American Life' is no way average or crap.<br />It's simple, stripped down and warming. There are songs on this album that deserve to become Madonna classics, such as the outstanding 'Love Profusion', 'Hollywood' and the beautiful ballad 'Nothing Fails'. The albums closing track 'Easy Ride' also deserves to be amongst the songs mentioned when people list Madonna favourites.<br />She probably did do herself no favours releasing the weakest song on the album as the main track to start the promotion for the album but don't hold back from purchasing this album because of that song because you are missing out on a true dark classic.
B00006JDS4|5.0|To give you an idea which side of the fence I'm on regarding whether the rape-revenge film I Spit on Your Grave is a female empowerment masterpiece or exploitation garbage, I submit the following: In 1978, when the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America for a theatrical rating, it was given an \\"X.\\" In order to insure an \\"R\\" rating, director Meir Zarchi made 17 minutes of cuts. It's this shorter, less explicit version that was released theatrically. In January of 1984, the MPAA sued the producers of I Spit on Your Grave, alleging that prior to the film's home video release, the filmmakers went back and secretly reinserted the excised 17 minutes. The producers clearly hoped the MPAA wouldn't notice, meaning this longer, more explicit cut would retain the \\"R\\" rating of the theatrical version. <br />Zarchi eventually told United Press International he wasn't sure which version of the film ended up on video store shelves, which is like saying you can't remember if your 3-year old baby is a boy or a girl. He knew exactly what version of the film had been submitted to the MPAA (the shorter, less explicit cut) and he knew exactly what version had been released on video (the longer, more explicit cut). And it only goes to prove one thing: Zarchi knew that if he stuffed his film with enough sexual violence (as opposed to enough female empowerment overtones) he'd have done his job as an exploitation filmmaker. <br />Mind you, there is nothing wrong with being an exploitation filmmaker. Exploitation films have a legitimate place in movie history and some of them (including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Abel Ferrara's Ms.45) are pretty enjoyable. Still, don't throw in a snippet of Sola Perduta Abandonnato by Puccini (which our heroine listens to as one of her tormentors bleeds to death) and use it as proof that the film is a deep-thinking, pro-woman, gender empowerment treatise. Frankly, I wouldn't mind any of this if I Spit On Your Grave was a well-written, well-directed film with interesting characters. It is clearly not. If the film works you up emotionally, it's because you'd have to be clinically dead not to feel for a woman being repeatedly raped and beaten. But this doesn't mean I'm watching a good film. It just means I'm human. There is very little dialogue in the movie, and what's there is not particularly well written. The entire film can be scanned in about 45 minutes, with absolutely no loss of impact. There are endless shots of boats floating on the water and people walking through the woods. This is not to create mood or dread or suspense. Actually, I'm not sure what it's for. I'll have to get back to you on that.<br />As our sordid saga begins, Jennifer Hills (played by Meir Zarchi's wife Camille Keaton) is on her way to a secluded cabin in the woods to write her first novel. We know the cabin is secluded because we spend endless, dialogue-free minutes watching Jennifer drive from the city to the country. After arriving at the cabin, groceries from the local store are delivered by Matthew (Richard Pace), a developmentally disabled fellow who looks like he wandered in off the set of Revenge of the Nerds. When Matthew reports back to his three friends that there's a hot babe in town, they do what any other young, healthy American male would do: they rape, sodomize and beat her within an inch of her life. The rape sequence is about thirty minutes long. One could argue that unless the rape is particularly brutal, Jennifer's eventual revenge would not seem so triumphant to her and satisfying to the audience. I argue that this film exists solely for the thirty-minute rape sequence, and the comeuppance that follows is only to avoid having the film branded as virtual snuff, meaning it would never be distributed in theaters.<br />I will say this: during the extended rape sequence comes the only decent bit of filmmaking in the movie. After being raped, a naked Jennifer wanders around the woods. She eventually comes across one of her assailants, sitting on a rock, playing the harmonica. Eventually, another assailant comes into view and slowly, menacingly, begins to approach her. As the man gets closer, the tempo of the other man's harmonica playing gets faster, which ratchets up the drama accordingly. It's effective, but so was my last prostate exam, and I felt pretty much the same way during both. <br />So, with Jennifer suitably stripped of her dignity, she decides to get revenge upon the four rapists. If I was ever going to enjoy this film, it would have been here, as Jennifer extracts juicy, ironic punishment on her tormentors. However, the film really fails here. Dramatically slack, Zarchi depends upon lazy writer's conceits to get each man to his grave. Matthew's comeuppance makes the most sense overall. However, if Jennifer's plan for Johnny (Eron Tabor) includes giving him her gun, she's taking an unrealistic gamble that he wouldn't just kill her right there (of course, his death is the best in the film, so that counts for something). From a screenplay standpoint, the last two men are dispatched rather lazily (it depends, among other contrivances, on Jennifer being able to steer a motorboat with pinpoint accuracy). The fact that the last two men die in an uncreative fashion, ninety seconds before the end credits, shows that Zarchi had lost interest by that point.<br />In fact, any self-respecting film lover will have lost interest long before that. Ultimately, what's galling about I Spit On Your Grave is not what it is (exploitation film). It's what it's trying to pass itself off as (feminist revenge saga). Meir Zarchi would have made an excellent used car salesman
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears has made another radio friendly album excluding two songs, &quot;Breathe on me&quot; and &quot;Touch of my Hand&quot;. The provocativeness of these tracks offer a new light on the fact that she probably didn't just lose her virginity. The other songs on the disc are in a strange sense what was expected. What you get is what you see. I have no problem with her &quot;growing up&quot; but is it to hard to make a song that no one would expect. The only possiably radio hit would be &quot;everytime&quot;. The rest of the disc will make great vidoes inwhich will have no problem becoming only video hits. The overall satisfaction level after listening to &quot;In the Zone&quot; would be a 6 out of 10.
B00004Z459|4.0|I don't know why, but they sound like little boys making some noise.  In a good way though.

I really like the title \\"A Place for My Head\\". LOL. \\"Cure for the Itch\\" is a cute little thing.  They sound so sweet when singing together in the chorus of \\"Forgotten\\".

0316666343|3.0|This is the type of novel where you read the opening chapters over about 30 times but struggle to finish the rest of it.  Alice Sebold excels at the sections which are her own experience thinly disguised as fiction but on the evidence here she's no novel writer.  Unfortunately Alice paints herself into a corner by killing off her best character right at the beginning of the book (ok she's still around to narrate the story, but she has no interaction with the other characters which limits her effectiveness).  Instead of carrying on with the story of Susie's murder and the consequences she fills the remaining chapters with boring stock characters and situations gleaned from popular fiction and films such as 'Ghost' and 'The Sixth Sense' (the alcoholic grandmother in particular seems to have wandered in from another novel).  I felt very cheated by the conclusion - especially as the author teases us by suggesting that Susie's body will be found and then moves on to a completely different - and ridiculous payoff.  The only thing that kept me reading was the hope that the killer would be caught (in real life even the dumbest cop could hardly fail to suspect him); that Susie's body would be found and buried;  that her family would be granted some kind of peace and that Susie herself would be empowered to move on to some new stage and break away from the past.  I'm not going to go into the bad writing, unbelievable behaviour of characters (sample: a recently bereaved father tacitly encourages his only remaining daughter to break into the house of the [person] who murdered her sister!) or numerous continuity errors here but where was the editor?  Someone should have told AS that her manuscript needed to be completely redrafted before it got to the publication stage, but then I guess they know this kind of stuff will sell shedloads of copies so why bother?

0385504209|3.0|I will admit I did not read all of the thousands of reviews for this book.  Therefore, if I am repeating what others have said, I apologize.  That said...<br /><br />\\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals are true,\\" states the book before the Prologue.<br /><br />However, the Dead Sea Scrolls were NOT found in the 1950s, as the character Teabing states. They were first discovered in 1947.  Teabing's character gives the reader the impression that the Catholic Church tried to suppress the scrolls because they contained damaging information.  However, the scrolls promote neither orthodox nor UNORTHODOX Christianity.  The community at Qumran (many scholars believe they were Essenes, and some scholars believe Jesus was an Essene himself) was not Christian, in fact, but Jewish.<br /><br />The book misses the mark when speaking of Constantine as well.  The book proposes that he changed the day of worship from the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday) to Sunday, the day pagans venerated the sun.  There is much evidence that Christians were worshipping on Sunday long before Constantine was even born.  Read Acts 20:7, 1 Corinthians 16:2, Revelation 1:10, for starters.  Early writers before Constantine (as early as the second century A.D.), such as Ignatius and Justin Martyr (just to name a few) describe Sunday as a day of Christian worship.  Constantine did NOT decide what was canonical.  A book had to fulfill certain principles for it to be considered canonical.<br /><br />As far as Jews looking down on celibacy at that time period, one must remember that Judaism at that time (and even in our present age...and also like other religions) had sects.  The Essenes, for example, were celibate.  While it would have been normal (and one might even say expected) for a young Jewish man to be married there ARE examples of celibacy being accepted, many of which are prophetic figures, like the prophet Jeremiah.<br /><br />These are just a few examples of statements in the book that should be looked into further.  Everyone should do their own research.<br /><br />Personally, I'm left confused.  Did Dan Brown purposely include erroneous material for a laugh?  Did he do it to make a point...that people easily accept what they read as fact?  Or did he simply not research the topics as well as many people seem to believe?  I am left thinking that it would be hilarious if this man, who many probably assume is completely anti-Christian, is actually in fact a Christian man who simply made a point...<br /><br />Regardless of all of this, I did enjoy the book.  Was it an amazing work of literature?  Not in my opinion.  Was it well researched?  Absolutely not.  As others have stated, I feel that there was no character development.

B00005R1N3|5.0|Before Halloween or Friday The 13th there was Black Christmas.  Black Christmas wasn't the first slasher flick(we have Mario Bava to thank for that, or even Hitchcock if you really wanna trace it back), but it's one of the best.  Why?  For starters, we're not dealing with the horny teen cliche.  The character development in this is actually quite good with interesting characters.  There's plot and story going on around the killings.  Many people found this boring, but to me it's realistic.  The phone tracing, the neighborhood watch, it all made it seem real.  What else?  The killer.  Find me another killer like this one and I'll eat my hat.  The phone calls he makes are MESSED UP and extremely disturbing.  It sounds like three people screaming at each other, and the conversation is bizarre coz it deals with a \\"Billy\\", \\"Agnus\\" and assorted names that are made so creepy coz they're never fully explained.  You never see the killer-only his eye in one particularly terrifying shot.  He whispers and .....I can't explain it all-just see it.  Starring the man who never ages, John Saxon, an extremely attractive Olivia Hussey and a very sexy Margot Kidder.  Directed by Bob Clark, who ironically gave us a more appreciated christmas movie a few years later with A Christmas Story.

0345350499|3.0|While this is certainly a well-written book, and an epic tale, I was glad to be done with it. This is the first book I read about the legend of Arthur and Camelot, and the overwhelming feeling I got from it was wretchedness. I had brought to the table images of gallant and glorious knights and adventure, expecting tales of bravery, brotherhood, and battle. But instead these characters are all deeply flawed and spend most of their time betraying and murdering each other. Since the book is written from the women's perspective, battles and adventures often happen off-screen, between chapters, and you see the knights riding off and perhaps returning, or it is summarized in a sentence or two. Meanwhile, you peer into the wretched lives of the tormented characters, as watch as every &quot;beloved&quot; character falls into ruination and death.<br />And it's not just the characters that you see like this. There is a strong religious theme in this book, showing the ruination and decline of the Goddess religion at the hands of the Christians. Gwenhwyfar herself is a dispicable character, obsessed with sin and slave to the church. You read the book from the perspective of these manipulating, conniving characters and watch the horrors that befall the noble great characters at their hands. And this just isnt very enjoyable to me. <br />I'm going to read &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; next and hope it comes closer to the ideas of the knights of Camelot I grew up with.
B000002ADT|5.0|This very album got me hooked on Jazz when I was only 15. Ever since then I have been addicted to Jazz. This album is amazing. Here, you have three horns, Miles Davis on trumpet, John Coltrane on Tenor saxophone, and one of my favorite Saxophonist Cannonball Adderley on Alto. All of them have very different sounds and styles of their own, and yet on this album they seem to join together in one sound. The improvisation on this album is exceptional and the best I've ever heard. The ideas of one player are passed around so eligantly, each player giving their own twist to the origional idea, mixing and blending their own ideas to it. Through out the album, the players remain spontaneous and free in their playing.  &quot;So What&quot; has got to be one of the best modal jazz tunes ever. But &quot;Blue in Green&quot; is the most beautiful of all of the tunes. I recommend this album to anyone, even fans of the so called &quot;easy listening Jazz&quot;. This is the most beautiful Jazz album ever concieved. Well worth the money!

B00005JKG9|1.0|This is a movie that stands out in my mind as one of the worst I have ever seen.  It is so depressing, and unsavory.  I'm sure the actors played their parts wonderfully, because I hated all of the characters by the end of this film.  I guess I can't stand all of the slick SOBs that close deals!

B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've been into Dream Theater for about a year, so I'm not an expert on them by any means and I don't pretend to be. I've all their albums though, and Train of Thought takes place as my personal favorite, beating out Live Scenes of New York by a considerable margin.<br />A lot of people say this is a step backwards, a regression into the days of Falling Into Infinity. I can see where they're coming from, but I disagree. This album, I'll come right out and say it, isn't typical DT. It's harder, louder, and it just won't stop. The longest track is over 15 minutes, for example.<br />This isn't another Metropolis, nor does it try to by another Images and Words. The 'prog' of DT's prog metal has morphed from artistic, technically pleasing riffs, solos, and melodies into complex, hard, impressive songs. Most of the solos that people fell in love with are still there. It's just they're all being played at the same time in order to make a collection of great songs. Not a collection of great three minute solos. I don't know about you, but I'd prefer a great 15 minute song instead of two really good three minute solos in said 15 minute song.<br />I think for that reason alone I admire Train of Thought. There are other reaons to be sure, and to be fair there are slow spots (the first four minutes of Honor Thy Father, for instance, but it grew on me). All I ask is that you give the album a spin. Borrow it from a friend, download a song or two (In The Name of God, Endless Sacrifice), get it used, but it is worth checking out.<br />How's this for my first review in, oh, forever? :P
B0000AQVCL|1.0|I went to best buy today and purchased Jet - Get Born today during my lunch break.  I was hoping to listen to it however IT WON't PLAY IN MY DVD-ROM or CD-ROM!  TY ELECTRA, YOU SUCK.  The media displays only 3 files on the &quot;enhanced&quot; CD.  These files are an autorun.inf, a B.S. flash menu, and a playCD.exe.  PlayCD.exe is most likely launched when clicking play cd in the flash menu, however playCD.exe doesn't run when launched through the menu or by executing it directly off the CD. <BR>It would be more aptly named &quot;wontplayCD.exe&quot;.  At least then it would be sort of funny as Electra loses market share.<br />Enhanced CDs are nice when they work, too bad this one doesn't.  I guess I will have to listen to it in the car.  Electra = Munsons!
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is so beautiful to look at, and so original...my two children, ages 2 and 4 1/2 watch it almost every day.  Seeing this movie has prompted my 4 1/2 year old to find websites about the ocean, and various sea life.  We've had many conversations about creatures of the sea...it's really got her thinking!
B0000CAQ27|5.0|This is an amazing album. Since the CD I got came with Feel Good Time, I will include this song in my review even though it's not on the track listing.<br />1. Trouble. I LOVE this song. It's perfect for someone like Pink. It has a nice, rocking, angsty feel to it. My only complaint is that the first time the bridge is sung, it is not done like the second one, because the second one sounds so much better. Rating: 10/10<br />2. God Is A DJ. The best part of this song is the bridge. I also love the way the line &quot;look for Nirvana&quot; is sung. It's a very catchy song, and I like the melody a lot. Rating: 9.5/10<br />3. Last To Know. This is true Pink. This is such an awesome song. I love everything about it. Rating: 10/10<br />4. Tonight's The Night. This is a pretty good song. It's got a pretty great melody, but the lyrics are kinda blah, except for &quot;Gotta get the hell out of Hollywood, 'cause every day here's Halloween&quot;. What really bugs me is the second-last time she sings the chorus, when she's shouting over it. Rating: 8.5/10<br />5. Oh My God, feat. Peaches. This is an awesome song. It's very breathy, but it fits with the song. I like Peaches' rap. The song is very catchy, and just really great. Rating: 10/10<br />6. Catch Me While I'm Sleeping. This is a very beatiful ballad, quite different from most of the album. It's got a beautiful melody, and the best part is the chorus. Rating: 10/10<br />7. Waiting For Love. This is a great song. Pink sounds amazing. I love the lyrics, the melody, everything. Rating: 10/10<br />8. Save My Life. I love this song. It has awesome lyrics with an awesome message, and such an addictive melody. Plus, Pink sounds pretty awesome. Rating: 10/10<br />9. Try Too Hard. I love,love,love,love this song. Pink sounds great, and it's really catchy, and the lyrics are cool too. Rating: 10/10<br />10. Humble Neighborhoods. This song has the catchiest chorus ever. It is so addictive. I love the fast, uptempo beat. Rating: 10/10<br />11. Walk Away. This is a very good song, with an awesome chorus. Rating: 10/10<br />12. Unwind. Pink sounds much raspier and more scratchy than usual on this song, especially on the chorus. I love it just as much though. I love the lyrics, especially the line &quot;I'm troubled, I'm brilliant, and miserable too.&quot; Good melody too. Rating: 9/10<br />13. Feel Good Time. I love this song. Rating: 10/10<br />14. Love Song. This is a prett
B000059MEK|5.0|There's a quote by Daft Punk that I will always remember:    \\"As a child, you don't judge music. You just like it or don't like it. You don't ask yourself if it's in good taste or bad taste.\\"    That's pretty much what their message with this album. It would be wrong to dismiss this CD from simply hearing \\"One More Time\\" on the radio, and (as countless other reviewer have said) no two songs sound the same. There's alot more depth to the album than people give it credit for.    Can't wait for their new album, due March 21st!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This is an amazing album. The songs are all amazing, the vocals are brilliant! If you really are a true Sarah fan, buy this album.
B00004U8JV|3.0|I think that Lost World was a very good movie. Sure it wasnt as good as the first one but what sequels are? The lost world improved JP's dinos making them more realistic and fritening. Although the plot wasnt as good it was better then the third and made more sense.
B000002UAU|2.0|If Fixing A Hole, She's Leaving Home and Within You Without You had been replaced by the best songs on Magical Mystery Tour (Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, All You Need is Love), which was released only months later, this would have been a 4 star album.  There are a few good songs here though.  The best is Sgt. Pepper.
B000075BFK|3.0|2Pac by far was the greatest rapper of all time.  There are many rap fans out there that would contest my statement, but all true rap fans have 2Pac in their collection.  I'm not going to compare rappers by any means, that is not the point of this review.<br />I gave 2Pac's alubm, BETTER DAYZ a rating of 3 Stars, for lack of a 3.5 rating.  I won't kid you, there are a number of good tracks on this ablum, but unfortunatly, the amount of mediocre tracks on BETTER DAYZ out numbers the amount of very good tracks.  The reason for this is that the music on BETTER DAYZ has been made to contemporary standards.  There is an obvious amount of guitars and sythesized music mixed in that takes away from 2Pac's natural and thugish style.  If you were to compare any album before BETTER DAYZ to BETTER DAYZ, you would notice the transistion as bold.  <br />But don't let this review discourage you from buying the ablum.  Like I stated earlier, there are some very good tracks on BETTER DAYZ that would be worth listening to.  And for that reason alone, BETTER DAYZ is a CD worth adding to your 2PAC collection.<br />I recommend the following tracks: Still Ballin, When We Ride On Our Enemies, F*** Them All, My Block (Remix), Thugz Mansion, Better Dayz and Fair Xchange.
0062513346|3.0|This is the first Coelho novel I've read.  I had been meaning to pick up the Alchemist, but during a flight from Toronto to Seattle a friend on the plane loaned me this book.  It is an easy read (I was done the book before we landed), but I think I may have gotten more out of it if I hadn't sped through it so quickly.  The book is a mystical and spiritual journey of a man who heads into the Mojave desert with his wife in search of an answer - how does one talk to and see their gaurdian angel. Sounds weird - right?  Well I thought so too.  I kept changing my mind as to whether I thought this whole book was a bunch of gobley-gook to thinking that perhaps this could be real.  I remember having the same mixed feelings while reading the Celestine Prophecy.  But, I wasn't quite hooked by this book - after finishing the book, I can't say that it has had any sort of lasting effect on me that I've been told it has had on others.  I'd like to think I read it with an open mind (which is definitely required) but, as I said before, perhaps I just sped through it too quickly not giving enough thought to some of the ideas being presented before me.  So...do I think this is a Hokey Tale or a Spirtual Guide?....I think I'll need to read this book again to decide.  All in all - this book is worth the read - read it and decide for yourself.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|This is a good choice of songs, covering 1975 to the present. The sound quality is fabulous. However, the question arises ... do we REALLY need yet another greatest? <br />There are other great ones out there (the Anthology &amp; even the new Bad Girls Deluxe Edition is better suited ... that has the 12&quot; versions) &amp; if you find it on Ebay get the Walk Away collection (greatest covering 1977-1980; 45 versions here but the song listing is outstanding).<br />This is just another way to say that Donna has a new album out ... please. I love Donna just as much as you all do (if you didn't you would not be reading this), but the repackaging of all the hits again &amp; again gets old ... hopefully this will be the last time...
B0000DZEA1|4.0|The soundtrack for ROTK had a tough job ahead of it: living up to the greatness of The Two Towers soundtrack. It didn't quite make it for several reasons. <br />One, most of the tracks are pretty short. Many pieces of music from the movie are unfortunately missing from this CD. For example, the music playing during the charge of the Rohirrim at Pelennor Fields was probably the best in the movie, but it's not on here. Also, Annie Lennox's &quot;Into the West&quot; just isn't very good, and doesn't hold a candle to &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; by Emiliana Torrini from The Two Towers.<br />Otherwise, this soundtrack is very good, particularly the singing by a couple cast members. Billy Boyd sings in &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot; and does an awesome job. Viggo Mortensen sings a few lines in &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, which easily helps me visualize Aragorn's coronation as king. So go and buy this CD, because it is worth it.
B00000F2M4|5.0|I have no idea why this awesome documentary about Sting is not available on DVD.  The music is awesome and the VHS format can't do it justice.<br />This video answered one main question for me when I first saw it ... will Sting be worth a darn without the Police?  The answer was hell yeah!<br />I believe the jazz roots that Sting hit on with the group of musicians he gathered together for his first solo album was his best.  As an artist he's still great, but his musical output is all Sting.  I really enjoyed this video because you could tell that his appreciation for jazz and the artists in his band overshadowed his tendancy to control everything.  I think eventually that's what lead to guys like Branford leaving, but in the beginning Sting was still like a kid in a candy shop verifying that what he suspected could be done, would be done and he would &quot;help&quot; to orchestrate it.  I think the artists had almost as much appreciation for Sting (or maybe just curiousity).<br />No matter, the video is great and should be available as a DVD.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|i loved her first cd, that cd was full of powerful and motivating music.<br />i've got her latest cd just yesterday, and i feel something really powerful through her whole songs on this cd.<br />especially, i like her &quot;you don't know my name&quot;<br />it makes me think of 70s music and also can feel some new groove.<br />i like Harlem's Nocturne very much.<br />i always get motivated by her music and her everything.<br />lovely. just lovely.
0140277447|1.0|Over 90 incorrect, or at least nonsense, descriptions are found in this book. This is proving Iris Chang has written this book based not on her own research but on materials provided by some (probably malicious) persons or parties (they must be sponsored by Chinese Communist Party). One more possibility is she was simply incapable of writing history.
076790592X|1.0|A good book or a bad book is one which makes you react - the act of reading that book should become a memory - a part of your life. Good and bad are subjective here - if you agree with the book, you call it a good book. If you disagree, you call it a bad book. But books like &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; are an insult to the written word. They are a collection of sentences that have no right to exist. In a very generous mood, I would even understand Mitch Albom's love for his mentor, but what makes people think that the secret to life lies in other peoples' experiences?<br />I can't wait to forget that I ever read this book...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is just an outstanding series.  I remain amazed, more than a year after it was cancelled, that Fox managed to screw this up.  The executive who did it needs some shootin', man.  Out of order, didn't air the pilot...<br />As a viewer, see the pilot first and you'll love the show.  Otherwise, it'll take, say, three episodes, in random order (just like Fox aired them), to get the same effect.<br />If you like SF (or just plain old good TV), you can't do any better than the 15 hours you'll get here.  Sadly, you might not get any more.
B00008WG3U|4.0|I have to admit, when I first heard this album, I thought it was horrible. After listening to it more, it has grown on me somewhat, but it isn't anything close to the level of HPZ, Thanks For The Shoes, etc...
B00005PJ8I|3.0|Having just watched this movie for the first time, I have to admit that it was more entertaining than I had been led to believe.  It is, of course, not a unique theme (what is nowadays?) in that it the story of a modern, successful corporate cog who is suddenly and unexpectedly forced to deal with a situation that requires him to learn anew how to survive.  During the course of which, he naturally is forced to reassess his own worldview as he no longer exists in an environment over which he has control.  I found the symbolism in this movie to be quite significant and relevant.  But overall the movie was not as profound and authentic as it could have been.  In fact, even with my limited knowledge of the subject, it is quite clear that the island could not have sustained any human life over the course of four years.  Interestingly enough, although license was taken in terms of the feasability of Chuch's survival on an isolated ecosystem, the producers had no problem in casting him as the employee of an actual courier company.  We could well have gotten the point of this movie had they devised a superficial company, which makes the movie in essence a three hour commercial.  <br />(In regards to the previous review concerning the package.  I believe that he returned it to the person who had SENT it, hence the angel-wings on the box--the symbolism of which is obvious enough.)
B00005OM4N|1.0|I regret that I bought this crap CD. I waste my money. It's not worth to listen to at all! she doesn't sing well. she only dances well. if she wants to make lots of money, she should be dancer or actrees or somethin'. Please do not purchase it. I won't buy brit CDs anymore
B0000028M7|5.0|This is my first encounter with Alice in Chains, Jar of flies is still on its way home, so i will not be reviewing this as a part of the band's resume.<BR>What has touched me in this album is the morbidness of Layne staley's lyrics, he is desperate, fighting his way through agonising pain and mental frustration, what makes this album stand-out from all those heavy metal trash that i've heard so far, is that it really comunicates with the listener, not only that, but it also brings you down to his own personall hell. Ofcourse he is being nihilistic about everything and desperate to survive. <BR>I am not much of a music critic, but let me say this, even if the guys really are not awesome guitarists, they certainly contribute a lot to the lyrics. Even if they are not as great as i don't know, Jimy Hendrix, they still bring out their own frustration, their own fears and desires. They certainly can play their instruments well enough to make me, not quite the average joe but still an average grunge listener, really being grabed by the balls and loving this record for all it's power, it's darkness, it's style. <BR>So as the bottomline, i would say: If you love the &quot;seatle&quot; sound, then this must a definitive part of your collection, as it is in the same league, with all those great records, Ten, Nevermind, Mother Love Bone, Every good boy deserves fudge and Superunknown.
0385504209|4.0|A solid page-turner that rivets the reader's attention. Tends toward cliches at times, but, overall, reading this book is a good investment of one's time.
B00006M183|5.0|Eddie Veder, is name that in the past, was a symbol of the Gen-X. Now, 10+ years later, he is still a spokesman, but now he speaks for a larger crowd, than the X-crowd. He speaks for everyone who has ever faced all the problems he adresses. From suicidal melancholy to love as the power to beat the devil. His lyrics, always complex, always beautifull and meaningfull. This time, a little better music than in the past few albums(Yield,Binaural), with exceptions ofcourse(Vitalogy, No Code) and this is propably their best album since Ten, if not even better. I suppose, because this is the second album of theirs that i bought, has somehow altered my perception of the others. But i never think too much when it comes to music, i like to feel its power.<BR>And as you might have heard, this album is the most mature of them all. Veder might still be a little bit angst ridden, but he has calmed down a lot lately and he shows that throught the album. Which has many many highlights, such as &quot;I am mine&quot;, &quot;Save you&quot;, &quot;Love boat Captain&quot;, &quot;You are&quot;....and a lot more. And in this day and age such a cd, is such a treat for all music fans, especially grunge fans though, because frankly decent groups are no longer given any publicity, and they are not as many as they used to be and don't get me started on Metallica's decent from greatness... anyways. <BR>This is a great album and it should be in every grunge-fan's collection.
6305696071|3.0|I enjoyed this movie and patiently waited for the DVD to come out.  I bought this DVD and realized there is a reason these scenes were cut from the movie.  They should have stayed on the cutting room floor.  I end up fast forwarding through the scenes.  I would much rather have the letterbox format without the extra scenes added.  Oh well.  Hopefully Touchstone Pictures will get the hint.
B000003TA4|5.0|The words that come into mind, when i hear &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot; is teenage angst, acerbic wit, all mighty lyrics, cool guitars, awesome drummer. Which is propably the case, for all the album, Dave Grohl, must be one of those &quot;all time greatest&quot; drummers, Kurt Cobain, one of those teenagers who used their talent to express their anger and Krist Novoselic, hmm...well there is a reason why after Nirvana disolved he never did anything worthy of writing home about.<BR>The lyrics in this album set the tone, by themselves, music comes as a supporting character, which adds that punch in the stomach which ofcourse is a little bit lightweight--in comparison to the awesome and equally great Bleach, but still they are enough to make a teenager jump-around like crazy. <BR>One thing that makes, Nevermind one of the greatest album of all times, is the compilation of equally good lyrics, music and performance that gets them on top of many other bands. And you bet, this can be on the cd-player for ages before you can get sick and tired for it. I can't really answer why though, it just magic sometimes, which ofcourse no Linkin' bloody Park or Limp f**** Bizkit will ever reach.<BR>Botomline, if this is not a partof your collection, then you my friend are stuck in the Dark Ages of our modern music pretentious bull-crap...thank you for your time.
0688156819|3.0|Tim Burton, The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories (Morrow, 1997)<br />Someone needs to explain this to me and fast, `cause I don't get it: how is it that bad poetry (and yes, folks, this is truly bad) and art that looks like a second-rate Edward Gorey ripoff (Burton is not the illustrator that he is the sculptor and animator) can be so insanely funny? I am completely at a loss for why I liked this anywhere near as much as I did.<br />Let's face it, if you squint right while watching The Nightmare Before Christmas, it's obvious even in Burton's finest work that the specter of Edward Gorey looms large over Burton's material; it has never been more obvious than it is here. Many of his characters even seem to have the same basic brushstrokes Gorey used in his illustrations. Which is not to say they're bad; they just look like Edward Gorey work. Not even as blurred as Bacon's famous study of Pope Pius.<br />And the verse? Absolute doggerel. Even conceding the idea that Burton is using Gerard Manley Hopkins-esque sprung rhythm (which he's not, because sprung rhythm does, at least, HAVE a rhythm), the implementation is so amateurish that it's impossible despite the rhymes to call this anything resembling poetry.<br />but good living Christ on a crutch, is this book funny. Morbid, twisted, insane, gut-churning (despite the pretty cartoons, folks, this is not one to buy for the kiddies; flip through the title story for a good example of why), and full of laughs. One almost gets the idea Burton was going for a place as the anti-Dr. Seuss. Little vignettes about characters who fade in and out like Dish Network reception in a typhoon, popping up unexpectedly here and there and doing exactly what you were hoping they wouldn't.<br />If you are at all a fan of Tim Burton, this is a must-read. If you're not, you're probably going to notice the faults and not find what lies beneath them. ***
B000066NW0|5.0|I was honestly shocked by this CD. I bought it just because I wanted the songs &quot;I'm With You&quot;, &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, and &quot;Complicated&quot;. In turn, what I discovered was an album full of awesome songs that I play all the time.<br />I typically listen to R&amp;B/Soul, Pop, Hip-Hop, and Alternative as well as the Christian artists that fall into those categories. I have to hear good vocals and enjoy the song overall. If I'm looking for good lyrical content I'll pick up a Floetry or Erykah Badu CD. Avril brings some mediocre lyrics to the table, but her vocals and the overall quality of the songs definitely compensate. She reminds me so much of Alanis Morrisette. Her voice is really cute, but not too cute, a la Britney Spears. The songs are all just awesome...well...my only gripe about the CD is Sk8er Boi, that was just way too pop for me. <br />Everything else is smooth, easy listening music that's great for the car stereo or just playing in your room at home.<br />I know a lot of people had a problem with Avril's image, but get over it. It's a business, you have to sell, you have to have a gimmick. Almost every popular artist today had some sort of gimmick when they first popped on the scene. But unlike other famous artists, this girl's got some talent, and this album is better than MANY others on the store shelves today. She's definitely not just a gimmick and this album is definitely worth the cash.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Since there are so many comments about the storyline and acting, I will just add a few words of praise for the technical quality of this DVD. <br />This film has been wonderfully restored. The transfer is virtually flawless. The picture is crisp and clean and in perfect focus. What an enjoyment to watch such a great classic in pristine condition. I wish every classic movie could be as lovingly restored as this one evidently has.
B000002UJQ|5.0|yeah I saw this album getting a somewhat lesser review (4.5 stars) due to people who just don't get.  it's very sad to see this.  oh well, if you came here to decide whether or not to buy this album-- then for God's sake, man, buy it!  It is a classic and THE best Radiohead album.  What other album sparks this much controversy (besides maybe Sgt. Pepper)
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Its really amazing seeing Pumping Iron again after so many years and seeing again why Arnold was my idol when I was a teen and getting into weight lifting. I used to anxiously await the arrival of the next issue of Joe Weider's Muscle magazine in the local health food store so I could be inspired by the awesome force that was Arnold Schwarzenegger. Then Pumping Iron came out, and I couldn't believe it! Actually seeing him on the screen...this dude was awesome...immense,beautiful, sculpted, so much charisma he didn't even seem human and even better, the confidence, the master of mind games, and  also he said whatever he felt like, and he was so much better than anyone else.<br />And now, with this 25th anniversary release, we get the original, showing the Force of Nature That Was Arnold...unbelievable, really, he was strength and beauty and charisma and you can't  take your eyes off the 28 year old Arnold...to compare to the recent specially- filmed material, which represents:<BR>Number one, A lot of  Arnold, since he does own this film now...<BR>Number two, Arnold the future politician, seemingly doing damage control,and despite soon to be the governernor of California, speaks as a politician does, equivocating and explaining things away. The young Arnold didn't care, he spoke his mind, you had to take him as he was, and he didn't care what people thought.<br />I don't know, I'm surprised that this guy, who had sooo much charisma, is now a movie star /politician who chooses his words carefully  (watch the Iron Insights portion of the additional material)and has got an agenda, just half his previous charisma (which is still a lot), but dyed hair and a botoxed forehead and waxy skin, and you compare him  to that young Force of Nature that he was... I kind of wish he kept being himself, and didn't change, didn't get plastic surgery, or go into politics where you're forced to speak politically and have to choose carefully your words...instead kept saying whatever he wanted because he was ARNOLD...I kind of wish that guy were still around, older, but realer, gray hairs, wrinkles (didn't Mike Katz and Luo Ferrigno and others look great, and older and REAL?)<br />Watch the original movie on the dvd, then the additional material, and reflect...Arnold did incredibly in his life, becoming wealthy and famous and powerful...but that 28 year old kid had something that the 55 year old Arnold has given up. THATS why I love the original movie, for the cameraqderie, the just-breaking out of this weird 'sport' of bodybuilding and the god who made it all possible.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears is hands down the greatest female pop star of all time. Everytime she releases an album, all the songs are fantastic &amp; single material. The only time I haven't liked every song on a Britney album was 'Oops I Did it Again&quot;. &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; is great, &quot;Toxic&quot; is a classic &amp; &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; is possibly the singer's greatest work to date. &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;, &quot;The Hook Up&quot; &amp; &quot;Showdown&quot; are also great dance tracks and &quot;Shadow&quot; &amp; &quot;Everytime&quot; are her best ballads without a question. I also really liked &quot;Early Mornin&quot;. She takes risks that always seem to work in her favor. She will always be my favorite female pop star.
B00003CX8Y|3.0|Does anyone else find it disturbing that the \\"beautiful\\" witch turned a little boy (albeit selfish) into a monster? If you'll listen to the song \\"Be Our Guest\\", you will find out that they've been rusting in the castle for ten years. And considering that the magical rose withers completely on his 21st birthday, I find it unbelievable that anyone could justify the actions of the beautiful witch....who had nothing better to do with her time than pick on an 11 year old boy.<br />You should never let strangers into the house, even if they're carrying magical beautiful roses.
B000003BEU|5.0|Yes, it's true that this isn't a typical Stones album.  In fact, it's probably the most un-Stone-like album they've ever done.  However, despite the oddness of this album, I love it.  I don't love it because it's perfect, I love it because it's a quirky but intensely enjoyable collection of odd songs that typify psychedelic music.  I bought a copy of the album for Christmas in 1967 and 37 years later, I still love to listen to it.
B00005JMCT|4.0|You cannot accuse \\"American Wedding\\" of false advertising on the basis of the cover of the DVD, because the character of Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) is featured prominently, right in the center.  Yes, it is rather amazing how the joke character from the original \\"American Pie\\" has taken over the series, and pretty much every memorable moment in this 2003 film belongs to Stifler.  But I am a fan of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and so I want to point out to director Jesse Dylan that he has Allyson Hannigan in this movie and why not take advantage of that fact and give her some good scenes?  After all, this is the actress who had the two biggest lines in the original \\"American Pie\\" (the second of which was ad-libbed).  But you can make the same argument for Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, and most of the cast in this one (and why is Thomas Ian Nicholas even back as Kevin?  He has nothing to do in this film).<br />The title is pretty much the plot of this film, as Jim (Biggs) proposes to Michelle (Hannigan), under the traditionally embarrassing situation we have come to expect from every major moment in Jim's life.  Michelle wants the perfect wedding and Jim promises her one, which means learning to dance.  Michelle's parents show up when Jim is having another one of his embarrassing situations, which means he has to redeem himself.  But the person who most needs redemption is Stifler, who is not invited to the wedding and does not deal well with rejection.  However, even the upcoming nuptials take a back seat when Stifler meets Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones) and tries to act like a human being in order to seduce her.  Meanwhile, Finch (Eddie Haye Thomas) is impressing Cadence by acting like Stifler and we are have totally jumped through the looking glass, boys and girls.<br />Consequently, in \\"American Wedding\\" Stifler reaches hitherto unsuspected heights as he starts thinking with totally different body parts than is his standard operating procedure.  It is totally appropriate, given all the horrible things that have happened to Stifler in the previous films, that in this one he does the worst one yet, to himself, and on purpose.  You have to stop and think about it a while to realize that Stifler is having an actuabl moment of nobility (the first of maybe two or three).  Otherwise, outside of Samuel L. Jackson when one of his characters goes to town, Steve Stifler is the Picasso of profanity (with credit for the creativity of his profanity being shared between Seann William Scott and writer Adam Herz).<br />Besides, when I start complaining that \\"American Wedding\\" did have enough sweet moments between Jim and Michelle, who is going to agree with me?  People watch the \\"American Pie Trilogy\\" for the vulgarity, both verbal and visual, so it seems rather ungracious to ask for something more (but they really should not have wasted Allyson Hannigan like this).re.

B0000DD7LC|4.0|This is an absolutely great cd...I think it's better than her first one. She is a wonderful artist.
0786867973|5.0|I have really enjoyed this book.  Since buying it about 6 months ago I've baked many of the recipes (more than I previously would have ever thought I would).  Nigella shines when it comes to description.  This book has lots of pictures, which many people seem to expect in a cookbook.  How to Eat has no pictures and it is equally as great as Goddess.  The good stuff comes out in Nigella's passionate writing style (with or without the pics).  Enjoy.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Okay, what happened Madonna?  You used to be fun.  I even thought you were a bad ass for a while there.  Some how or another you even wrangled up some fun songs along the way.  You were sexy and goofy and fun.  I thought maybe you were really interesting in the way women hadn't been since Debbie Harry or Annie Lennox.  Then you started putting out these blips and bleeps that you claimed was music.  I miss you...or the you I thought was you.  Come back.
0517548232|4.0|If you are even remotely interested in what can be a sometimes boring and usually complex subject, this is a fantantistic introduction.  Sure, there are going to be those who point out it's fallacies but the book was written more for the laymen, not graduate studies.  Readable and concise.
B000002OZY|5.0|Tommy is an important piece of rock history that is among the top 25 all-time classic rock recordings.  It goes along with Sergant Pepper, Are You Experienced?, The Allman Brothers at the Fillmore East, and all the other pivotal albums.
0064430227|5.0|Harold and the Purple Crayon was a favorite of mine when I was a child (in the late 1950's).  I was delighted to find it again when my children were born, and it soon became a favorite of theirs.  They declared the apple tree to be a donut tree (then pronounced \\"doe-doe\\"), and insisted on naming every type of pie on the picnic blanket, every time we read the book!  It is now the first book I include in the collection I give as a baby shower gift.
B00000612P|5.0|The process of my decision making is very strange and ineffective. It took me 32 years to decide to buy this album, although I did know all the time how great it was. In all these years I bought numerous albums that are far inferior to this one. Is it because I didn't like - to put it mildly - Rod's musical achievements after the early seventies?<BR>Anyway, this album is really fantastic, as almost all the other reviewers agree. But I think it is not Rod's best album, 'A Nod's As Good As A Wink' that he recorded in the same year with The Faces is even better. The funny thing is that I bought that one immediately after its release in 1971...

B0000DD7LB|2.0|I know I'll be using a regular cliché by saying this, but this album is the epiphany of the fact Britney has absolutely no vocal power whatsoever. I have bought this album together with Christina's &quot;Striped&quot; and the difference is so overwhelming that I find no words to explain it.<br />Britney just keeps on meowing and purring throughout the CD and the only saving grace of this album are the excellent background sound effects.<br />&quot;Me Against the Music&quot; seems so nice only because she takes refuge behind Madonna's and other background voices, otherwise you could have a glimpse of how absurd her voice really sounds in this CD.<br />Anyway, I will not rush and say this is the beginning of Britney's decay, for great voices have disappeared into oblivion while other not so great voices prevailed, like Madonna's example. Let us wait and see what cards she still has to play (and by the way, she will have to do much better than that wedding gig).
B00000J048|4.0|My son received this toy for Christmas, and we gave one to our niece. The verdict is that it is almost, but not quite, perfect.<br />The toy is a set of interlocking squares of various colors that are perforated to hold a four-pronged hub that can support one of four sizes of gears. Everything is made of a durable plastic that has some flex to it. You can create systems of gears that spin around and even construct things like gearboxes. (The cover of the box--shown above--will give you a simple idea of what can be done.) There is a manual aimed at parents that helps them teach their child how gears work, too--a nice touch.<br />The quality of the toy is high: the colorful stickers for the gears are plastic coated, the injection-molded pieces are free from excess plastic, and the pieces fit together solidly. It's everything you would want from a European-made toy. (Quercetti, the manufacturer, is based in Italy and the toy is actually made there.)<br />It's a mesmerizing little toy and its variability is virtually endless. There are other kits in the Gear line that include such things as universal joints and 3-D parts, so it is highly expandable, even as your child ages.<br />My quibble? Our three year old niece adores the toy, but our three year old son only plays with it in fits. Truth be told, I play with it more than my son does. So as with anything, your mileage may vary.<br />It's nice that toys like this one are still being made. There's a lot of learning that can occur with it, too. Factor in the expandability and how can you go wrong?<br />Now if only I could get my son to join me more while I'm playing with it!
0767817664|5.0|I must have viewed this movie 2 dozen times and every time it is a treat. Will Ragsdale probably leaves something to be desired but Roddy Mcdowall as Peter Vincent steal the show anyway. This movie does an excellent job of satirizing the vampire genre while at the same time respecting itself and traditional vampire lore. This mix keeps it from taking itself to seriously and makes this a fun mvie to watch again and again. The sequel directed by Tommy Lee Wallace (director of Halloween 3)instead of Tom Holland is second rat in comparison but still do yourself a favor and grab them as a two pack. This would be a great franchise for a remake if appropriate cast could be found.
0385504209|1.0|I really would not have been surprised if one of Dan Brown's woefully inane characters made a similar statement.<br />The Davinci Code is an incredulous monument to ignorance, sensationalism, and utterly graceless writing. The latter fault is the biggest crime foisted upon the reading public. It astounds me when people laud this book as &quot;well-written,&quot; when his style is virtually indistinguishable from that of any book from the Hardy Boys series. The characters are not compelling or even remotely likeable, and the &quot;plot&quot; is rammed down the reader's throat with no sense of aesthetic or pacing. It has the same intellectual and spiritual benefits as listening to the massacre of a litter of kittens at a high decibel. It reads not like a true novel, rather like a pitch for a made-for-TV movie.<br />Yet Brown's mockery of good taste does not end with childish storytelling or wooden language. Much of his history is suspect as well. While I will not pretend to know everything about the subject, what I do know about history conflicts with Brown's interpretation. It's not that Brown outright lies, rather misunderstands facts or takes them out of context. For example, he claims that Constantine was a die-hard pagan who only converted at his death-bed. Nevertheless, baptism on one's death-bed was the modus operandi for Christianity at the time; the thinking being that since baptism completely washes away one's sins and is a one-time only deal, being baptised moments before death was the best way to ensure eternal paradise. Thus, Constantine was like virtually every other Christian at the time. This is only one example of Brown's shallow understanding of history.<br />This book is a complete waste of time. Not only does it lack in any artistic merit, but its history is suspect, and moreover does not even have &quot;entertainment value.&quot; If you're looking for entertainment, check out Monty Python.
B00005JMFO|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. <BR>It has a wonderful cast of characters.  I loved the colorful<BR>Hugh Grant as England's Prime Minister.  The sound track for this movie is excellent.  I would definitely recommend seeing this film--you will leave the theatre feeling great.
B00005MNP7|5.0|This 4th album from the legendary Blondie is all about Debbie Harry's soaring vocals and drummer Clem Burke's explosive pounding.  Witness the sonic boom of &quot;Dreaming&quot; that starts with a drum solo that basically continues throughout the entire song.  The rest of the band are tripping over themselves to keep up with Burke.  He's frantic and amazing; maybe the best to come along since Keith Moon.  This album will set your heart racing.  I promise.
B00008J4P5|4.0|There's really nothing special about the White Stripes, other than the fact that they're a good band that has managed to get very popular.  They're not profound, they're not deep, they're not arty, they're not entirely original, and they're definitely not instrument virtuosos.  They write fun, unpretentious, hard-rocking tunes that never fail to delight.  Their sound is a mix of rock, punk, and blues, and is always very catchy.  Elephant is without a doubt their best album.<br />THE SONGS:<br />1. &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;: The overplayed single.  A really great song, even after hearing it a million times.<br />2. &quot;Black Math&quot;: Rawk.  Faster and punkier than the other songs on the record.<br />3. &quot;There's no home for you here&quot;: AWESOME.  The chorus will be in your head for weeks.<br />4. &quot;I just don't know what to do with myself&quot;: Mediocre, skippable.<br />5. &quot;In the cold, cold night&quot;: A very mellow, blusey number that features Meg on vocals.  Very, very good.<br />6. &quot;I want to be the boy to warm your mother's heart&quot;: Great lyrics, skippable song.<br />7. &quot;You've got her in your pocket&quot;: A[...]  A very mellow, sweet song with another insanely infectious chorus.<br />8. &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot;: HELL YES.  A long, sprawling epic of pure bluesy rock n' roll and great guitar.<br />9. &quot;The hardest button to button&quot;: The other overplayed single.  And like 7NA, still great after many listens.<br />10. &quot;Little Acorns&quot;: Funny, but skippable.<br />11. &quot;Hypnotise&quot;: Rockin' out again.  Another one of the punkier tracks.<br />12. &quot;The air near my fingers&quot;: Nothing special, just a good song.<br />13. &quot;Girl, you have no faith in medicine&quot;: YES.  Best song on the CD.  Must be heard.<br />14. &quot;It's true that we love one another&quot;: Goofy and catchy, and better than what people say.<br />Bottom line: Worth buying if you're into basic, straight-up rock n' roll and are just looking for a good time and a great record to rawk out to.a good time and a great record to rawk out to.
B00000IAU3|4.0|It was clear from the beginning that Eminem's princess Dido had a lot more to ofter to the music world than just Stan' s refrain . In her first offering &quot; No Angel &quot; she sings about emotional suffering with all the simplicity of a human creature ( &quot; ...i just want to feel safe in my own skin &quot; ). &quot; Here With Me &quot; ( one of the most tender songs to have ever hit the top 5 ) , &quot; Hunter &quot; , &quot; Thank You &quot; and the melancholic &quot; Honestly O.K &quot; are just some of the highlights yet the track which , at least in my opinion stands out is  &quot; Don't Slide &quot; with it's sensitive and at the same time intense character . Nothing would have been the same ofcourse if it wasn't for Dido's warm , beautiful voice which is so affecting . An overall remarkable debut album withought doubt .
B000002H2H|5.0|This is obviousally metallicas best cd with hard rock smashing songs that will make u head bang. I recommend it to all.
B000089RVR|5.0|As with most critics, I don't agree with any of the negative reviews regarding LIFE FOR RENT, Dido's second outing.  Maybe it's because I've been following Dido's career since her participation on REVERENCE, the debut CD from Faithless (one of brother Rollo's many projects).  Or better yet, maybe it's because we haven't had a musical artist that writes, performs and produces the way only Dido can.  She has appeared on each Faithless CD and is still &quot;chilling with the family&quot;, with brother Rollo providing support in her ever-growing solo career.<br />Strongly present are the acoustic guitars, soft hip-hop beats, well layered harmonies, plush keyboard and piano backgrounds (some of which are provided by Sister Bliss) and lyrics of relationships and life.<br />Each song is strong in its own way.  With many Radio-friendly tracks, interest in LIFE FOR RENT should continue well through 2004.  Standout tracks worthy of airplay or commercial release include : &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot; (possibly this CD's &quot;Here With Me&quot;), &quot;White Flag,&quot; the title track, &quot;See The Sun,&quot; and &quot;Stoned&quot; (which has been recently remixed for Club Play by Deep Dish and Spiritchaser).  The CD also has the bonus hidden track, &quot;Closer.&quot; <br />Dido delivers yet another exceptional release, which could easily have been titled &quot;Greatest Hits II.&quot;
B00005JKC3|4.0|Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), a scientist who has followed in the foot steps of his father who he does not remember.  However, his father did leave him with something other than repressed memories which is buried within his own genetic structure.  This creature within is awakened when something goes wrong in the university lab where Bruce works with his coworker Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).  The strong emotional bond between Betty and Bruce is tested and the question arises whether it will restrain the dark manifestation that appears when Bruce is cornered and threatened.  The Hulk offers an intelligent view on the comic book character with the same name through the use of biopsychosocial issues.  This is combined with challenging cinematography that enhances the feeling of reading a comic book through split screens and slides.  Overall, Ang Lee brings out the best in the characters through his direction, which can also be viewed in Eat Drink Man Woman and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  As a result, the directing enhances the genuine human characteristics of the characters.  This film however, suffers slightly from its challenging cinematography which makes details hard to pay attention to, but in the end the film offers a very good cinematic experience.
B00000GUZP|5.0|This crazy white girl put nails through her head to make you people happy.  Do you people know no limits??  Give it up for Debbie for working with Nile Rogers years before Madonna gave birth to &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; doing the same thing.  Debbie was Urban (i.e. black) way before it was cool.  I listen to this and I still can't believe the set of balls this woman had to record this in 1981.  Of course she wrote &quot;Rapture&quot; the year before, who else?  I give her major props.  You should too.
B00005JM20|4.0|Agent Johny English is prepared, brave, and confident, and his strategic planning is not all that bad... I just don't know why disasters keep following him. Bad luck, I guess. But he succeeds after all, saving the British crown, winning the heart of his beautiful partner - and giving you some good laughs in the process.<br />I think the fans of Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean will not be disappointed. Although he plays a very different (and talking) character in this movie, I still spotted some classical \\"Beanish\\" behavior - like messing up and trying to cover it up rather then confess. This makes the character pleasantly recognizable, and you somewhat know what to expect from him, in a good way.<br />I give the movie 4 stars, withholding one for some potty humor (sorry, just don't like it).
B00005JLK1|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie. I know that it got bad reviews, and alot of the people who have reviewed it gave it low ratings. But when I saw it, I sat through the whole thing, thinking of what could happen next. The music is bloody awesome, especially 'Not Calling' and 'My Little Box' [the music to the part when the little girl, Katie, is showing Ebbs what happened]. <BR>I give it five stars. It is not scary, but pretty gory, with slight swearing and some nudity. I love it to bits, and I would love to see it again anyday.
B0000C8AQM|2.0|This album was a big disappointment.<BR>I have given it 2 stars, because it certainly does contain some undeniably great rock songs, such as The Immigrant Song.  However, having also seen the film, I find myself asking... what about all the other good songs they had??<BR>Back in Black, Smoke on the Water, Highway to Hell, just to mention a few, are all used to some extent within the film, and their absence from the soundtrack is a huge let down.  These are classic rock songs, done by some of the greatest rock bands of all time such as Deep Purple and AC/DC, and their omission from the CD will be inexcusable for those who have seen the film.<BR>Buy it if you want a taste of some classic rock, but there are much better rock compilations available.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I heard their first single at about 3 in the morning on MTV of all places, and I knew I had to get the CD.  And I am so glad I did.  This cd truly does rock.  I'm not trying to say by any means that this cd is groundbreaking or these guys are really talented, but they do what they do really, and that is play good, classic, rock music.  The lyrics are simple mostly about girls or people giving them hard times, but they throw some personal views in the mix with songs like Lazy Gun.  The slower acoustic songs rock as well, except for maybe Timothy which is definitely the low point on the cd.  Its so hard to find a band with this sound now a days, some of the new bands claim to have a similar sound but Jet truly does have a 60's and 70's sound to them and its really refreshing to hear.  I recommend this cd to anyone who likes good rock music period.  It is simple fun and enjoyable to listen to.
B0000640S2|2.0|When people think of Rambo and all that he represents, they're actually thinking of First Blood Part II (and Rambo III), replaced by a more escapist-oriented tone and approach. Virtually absent from this film is the &quot;realism&quot; of the first picture. Through and through, Rambo is nothing more than a full-blooded action film and because it's more forthcoming with its modest aspirations, it makes for better and more consistent entertainment than its predecessor. That still doesn't say much.<br />After the events of the first film, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is still serving time in a prison, but is given the opportunity for a pardon of all wrongdoings if he participates in a top-secret operation. Informed of the plan briefly after his release, he will parachute into Vietnam to search for evidence of American POWs in a specific prison camp. He's not to engage in combat, only to take photos. Teamed up with Co Bao (Julia Nickson), a Vietnamese freedom fighter, he sets out to free all the prisoners, even against the orders of his superiors.<br />Anyone looking for entertainment value based on plot and characters will be sorely disappointed. Both aspects are where the movie's flaws lie. Generally, the story just isn't that interesting, usually serving to drag the picture down rather than giving it a boost in between the action scenes. Stallone still makes for an effective Rambo, this time elevating his character to genuine action hero status. The human qualities he displayed in the first film are still evident, mixing in nicely with his outlandish heroics.<br />But it's virtually everyone else who's subpar. As the love interest, Julia Nickson was chosen for her appearance (and yes, she's very beautiful), but this isn't a role that does her any favors. Not only is the actress obviously half-caucasian, to give her the flavor of a Vietnamese woman, she speaks broken English, meaning she says lines like &quot;You not expendable,&quot; basically leaving a word or two out of each sentence. But her pronunciation of each word is so precise and without a hint of an accent, it's so obvious she's actually fluent in English. Why didn't the filmmakers just let her play her character as such?<br />Aside from Richard Crenna, all the supporting players, whether on the American, Vietnamese, or Russian side, are all one-dimensional caricatures. As service to a mindless action film, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but knowing where all the characters stand from their very first appearance (even the so-called traitors are easy to point out) makes for less interesting viewing.<br />When the action is on-screen, FBII is sometimes a good slice of thrilling escapism. The first hour is completely dull, none of the shootouts or fights are directed with much flair or energy, but the last fifteen minutes are actually a pretty jolly good time, with Rambo taking on both the Russian and Vietnamese armies. Standout action scenes include the fight aboard the Russian chopper, the destruction of the prison camp, and the climactic helicopter chase, one of the series' most exhilarating action setpieces (nice to see the movie end on a very high note). The film is nicely backed by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score, one of the famed composer's best works.<br />Released the same year as that other one-man army flick, Arnold Scwarzenegger's Commando, FBII is superior in many ways. The action choreography is slicker and arguably on a larger scale, the cinematography and direction is overall crisper, and Goldsmith's score is far more effective than James Horner's. But in the end, Commando is the far more entertaining picture because it maintains a fast pace and a great sense of macho fun from the first minute to the last. That, and a good sense of humor, is what elevates that film to the top of its kind.
B000089RVX|5.0|I really like this cd. I think that it is one of the best cd's out there. It seems kind of evil, but at the same time very innocent, if you know what I mean. Amy Lee's voice is one of the best voices out there, at least I believe. If I had to choose my favorite cd out of all the cds I have, this would be the one. I definately recommend this cd to everyone that likes rock music! I can relate to a lot of the music in  one way or another and if you can't relate, the lyrics are still really good! Anyways, you should definately consider adding this cd to your collection..
B000065U1N|4.0|Slice of war lacks a particular political point of view and instead mirrors back the American public's indifference to involvement in foreign affairs. The film is partly propagandic in painting a simple crude picture of the enemy seizing all food-care shipments from whom they perceive as their enemy. There is just not enough evidence presented to support the risk imposed in sending military special forces into Mogadishu to contain ( kidnap? kill? ) Somali dictator Muhammad Farrah Aidid.  Regardless, the movie is a harrowing depiction of men in military conflict, extremely well filmed and very sad. I'm disturbed to see our American troops immortalized in this way and &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; forces us to contemplate our military actions.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have to say that when I first saw the previews for this show I thought it looked a bit odd and wouldn't be all that great...well, to say the least, I was wrong! The show is a great mix of drama, suspense, humor, action and adventure. <br />The characters of the show are unique because even if the characters dont get along (Simon, Jayne) they will help each other when the time calls upon it. And each character has their own faults and plus sides that make them seem more than just fictional characters. <br />And if great characters and story lines dont get you into it then the very good CGI space scenes will surely grab your attention. <br />Firefly is a show all it's own and its a shame that it had to be taken off the air and just having people telling you about it isn't enough, to actually get the full gist of what everyone is ranting and raving about you need to actually see it with your own two eyes and the best way to do this is to buy the complete series...believe me you wont be disappointed!
B00009TB5G|4.0|'The Two Towers' is as good as the first installment - if not better.  Jackson did the smartest thing in trilogy movie history by filming all three movies at once.  The continuity is there - and it's flawless (take *that* George Lucas).  As with the first movie - the additional/extended scenes put into the feature itself is so seamless - as opposed to most DVD extras where 'deleted scenes' are extras and not in the context of actual film.<br />The length of the movie is no issue - it's long, but like 'The Fellowship of the Rings', it zips by and you're left wanting more.<br />Casting is superb - and before I had seen, I questioned the CGI-ness of Gollum.  But Andy Serkis probably wasn't off the mark thinking he should be eligible for a supporting actor nomination (it should defintely go to Sean Astin for ROTK though).<br />Unlike others who purchased this set - I did not have issues w/duplicates of same disks in my package nor are any of the disks defective (and I bought this on the first day of release).  I really enjoyed the extras and the movie making process - including adapting and interpreting of Tolkien's work.<br />If there's a flaw - the audio mix can seem muddled from time to time.  It's not my tv - and I don't think it's the actors.  Sometimes the music seemingly drowns out the dialogue.<br />It's a great movie and a solid purchase (why rent when you can own?)
B00003CXDG|4.0|Maybe it was because I was in the mood for a blockbuster action thriller or maybe it's because I was never a huge fan of the original film in the first place, but Mission: Impossible II satisfied my craving for an adrenaline rush and on that basis alone, I highly recommend it. Put it this way, if you enjoyed the first M:I for its emphasis on teamwork and convoluted storytelling, then don't even bother with the sequel, as the credited director John Woo should give you a damn good idea of what to expect.<br />Tom Cruise returns as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, our intrepid spy who now appears to have a knack for rock climbing and martial arts. His assignment is to recruit thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to go undercover for the agency to spy on renegade agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his formidable army of henchmen. Ambrose has plans of becoming a billionaire, but in doing so, could cause great devastation to the population of Australia. Naturally, it's up to Hunt to rescue the girl, kill the bad guy, and save the day.<br />Through and through, M:I-II never feels like anything less than a Woo production. Almost all his signatures are here: balletic slow motion, two-fisted guns a'blazing, flying doves, and a sort-of Mexican standoff. The only thing missing here is the countless gallons of blood we've come to expect. M:I-II, as it turns out, is his first and only PG-13 production, but the lack of ultraviolence didn't bother me in the slightest.<br />What is less forgivable is the almost utter lack of action in the first seventy minutes. Well, that's not entirely true. There is that climbing sequence and the car chase not long thereafter, but Cruise doesn't even stand off against his first true nemesis until after an hour in. What's to hold our attention until then? Maybe the plot, if you're into typical Bond stuff, which is exactly what this story is, typical Bond material. We've got the almost megalomaniacal villain (he doesn't want the world, but he wouldn't mind devastating parts of it to get what he wants), the gorgeous love interests, and a few neat gadgets here and there.<br />When the action hits, M:I-II is almost a non-stop action extravaganza, delivering tense gun battles, a breathtaking and simply awesome motorcycle chase (one of my favorite John Woo action scenes), and a fun mano-a-mano duel to the death. Cruise is completely convincing as a physical action star, he's got the style, the charisma, and the moves. He's the star of the show, which might disgust some, but he capably carries the production. Newton makes for a gorgeous love interest, and Ving Rhames is THE man as Luther Stickell, everyone's favorite computer hacker. Dougray Scott disappoints as the villain, though, he doesn't conjure enough spite and isn't menacing enough.<br />From beginning to end, if there is one consistency to M:I-II, it's how lovely the film looks. Shot on beautiful locations with a great eye, this is a movie that's always nice to look at. As such, the film should be enjoyed for what it is, an action blockbuster in the vein of James Bond. Sure, it probably could have used a tad more action in the first half and Woo does go overboard on the slow-mo by the finale, but M:I-II is purely fun stuff, and when the action's on-screen, it's exhilarating.
B00005JMCT|2.0|It's not a horrible way to spend two hours but really isn't anything special and I was very very disappointed.<br />American PIE had its share of gimmick jokes and gross out jokes, but it managed to combine them with relevance and SEXINESS!!<br />American WEDDING doesn't even try to be sexy. Which was a huge part of the success of American Pie. It was SEXY and FUNNY! We had a handful of beautiful girls and guys in REALISTIC, funny and SEXY moments.<br />American Wedding on the other hand, has NONE of that. Stiffler (Scott) pretends to be somebody else in order to beat out Finch (Thomas) and get into Michelle's (Alyson Hannigan) sister Cadence's (the very attractive January Jones) pants. This story line takes up about 70% of the movie and nobody actually does. It's like telling a story an entire movie and never delivering with the punchline. Instead we end up with a sex scene with Grandma.<br />The American Pie movies have made a lot of money for their studio. You'd think that they'd have the green light to do WHATEVER they wanted... and they did!<br />Well, they chose to use that power to do jokes typical of JACKASS like eating dog poo, dancing in gay bars, having sex with grandma, humping dogs and shaving pubic hair.<br />Me personally, I would have rather seen the sexiness brought back. Bottom line. American Wedding ISN'T sexy. It's mostly GROSS with some laughs. In fact, on the DVD, the Director even says that the studio recommended they add something to make it sexier. Preferably with Cadence, and they didn't.<br />The unrated version does feature an extended bachelor party. It isn't that big of deal. Would have rather seen Cadence do something MILDLY sexy. I mean, didn't January Jones see what American Pie did for Shannon Elizabeth, Mena Suvari and Tara Reid's careers!
B00008PW2D|3.0|While I am a diehard SATC fan, and of course had to buy this set to complete my collection, I must admit that the pricing on Season 5 is too much for what you get.  We were ripped off already with a short season and there is no reason for HBO to have priced it so that we are ripped off again.  The extras were disappointing since the description for the dvd set had me expecting more of them.  Overall I would have to say that if you are a diehard fan, this is a must have to complete your collection.  If you are on the fence, wait for Season 6 to come out which will be well worth your money.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Actually give this one 4 1/2 stars.  Much closer to the spirit of the comics than the first movie.  General Stryker hates mutants even though his son is one.  He has a beef with Professor X and his school and begins his hunt against the mutants.<br />Not only that, but Stryker knows Wolverine from the past and while not going into detail, it's clear he was the one who gave Wolverine is adamantite claws and bone augmentation as a weapon.  Again, staying somewhat true to his Weapon X origins.<br />Several new X-men are along for the ride, most notably the spectacular Nightcrawler who has a fantastic sequence where he teleports through the Whitehouse taking out guards in order to kill the president.  <br />We also see Bobby Drake as Iceman, Pyro, and a short cameo with the armor skinned Colossus as a student in the school.  <br />Also back is Ian McKellan as Magneto and Rebecca Romijn Stamos as Mystique,who joins forces with the X-men to fight Stryker and his troops.<br />Much better story than the first movie and more exciting.  Wolverine, Iceman, and Nightcrawler get the bulk of the character development at the expense of Cyclops and Rogue who have rather minimal roles in the movie.<br />The DVD is loaded with many extras and multiple commentaries.  One of the best DVDs of 2003.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|A Beautiful Mind is not a great movie, certainly not 2001's best film, but it's a respectable effort from director Ron Howard, and especially writer Akiva Goldsman, who was partially responsible for the travesty that was Batman and Robin. This biographical drama focuses on the life of John Nash, the genius who developed a radical concept on game theory. I'd rather not say further about the story, since there's a big plot twist halfway through that definitely puts a spin on much of the material that came before it.<br />As most have heard, A Beautiful Mind is largely inaccurate in its depiction of John Nash's life. Did I really care? Not particularly. I'd be a fool to expect a film based on facts to adhere entirely to the truth. Rather, I'm basing my opinion on how well-crafted the movie is, and how well it succeeded on what it was trying to be, that is, a film meant to inspire with its theme of love (and besides, I seriously doubt all the indiscretions of Nash's life would mesh well with that, so I'm wondering if the film's detractors really want to see all of Nash's odd behavior portrayed or if they're just looking for something to complain about). So how does this film come across as a feel good drama? Not bad.<br />First off, I'd like to mention that Ron Howard's direction and Goldsman's screenwriting are easily the film's weakest points, and not deserving of the Oscars they received. As has been evident in previous works, Howard is not a master of subtlety, and as best as he tries, he obviously doesn't have a firm grasp of what's genuinely good drama. A lot of the film's emotional moments are overdone and pure Hollywood; there's typical shouting, crying, and glass-breaking, nothing I haven't seen before. While I have a lot to complain about Howard's direction, he's fine when it comes to pacing and style, and yes, the film itself does look very lovely and polished.<br />Definitely by far the film's weakest segment is in the last ten or so minutes, when we witnessNash age and receive his nobel prize. That alone doesn't sound so awful, but unfortunately, we get a speech that lamely hammers home the movie's message, that of how we must rely on emotion and love over cold intellect to solve our problems and survive in this world. It had already seemed obvious that was what the film had been striving to say throughout its rather lengthy running time, and I sure as hell didn't need Howard to blindly forcefeed the theme in such a manner.<br />Since I've done nothing but complain up to this point, you might wonder why it is I didn't give this film a lower rating. The answer's simple. This all works thanks to Russell Crowe as John Nash and Jennifer Connelly as his wife, particularly the latter, who delivers a magnificent performance worthy of far more screen time (it's all the more disappointing to see that we never even find out what she does for a living, considering she was the one supporting Nash in his later, troubled years). Crowe is in fine form in the lead, both sympathetic and likeable, though some of his tics seem more like obvious attempts at acting rather than genuine eccentric behavior. It's unfortunate the love story between Nash and Alicia isn't even given any sense of build up, she just asks him out without even a hint of a reason for why she finds him attractive (well, Nash here does look like hunky Russell Crowe).<br />Schizophrenia is a disease that's dealt with in the film. I've never studied up much on it, though on my paltry knowledge alone, I probably know far more than most Hollywood (most often, as in the case with Me, Myself, and Irene, filmmakers seem to think schizophrenia is just another term for multiple identity disorder). (moderate spoiler) I don't know how accurate A Beautiful Mind's portrayal of this mental illness is, but the Nash in the movie hardly seems like a true &quot;loony,&quot; and the film makes the disease seem a bit easier to handle than it probably is (Nash sees a few people who aren'tthere, and at one point, even reasons that they can't be there). Much like the rest of the film, the handling of this topic feels Hollywood, but also like the rest of the film, it's handled competently and in an occasionally riveting fasion.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Different... yes.<br />Good... definately.<br />Better than the first 2 movies... IN SOME WAYS.<br />I figured that T3 would be an abomination. When I first heard that it may be rated PG-13, I immediately gave up on it. Then it was rated-R and my hope was redeemed.<br />Then when I heard that James Cameron wasn't directing, I was again put off, but thankfully, I went to go see this and hungrily gathered up the DVD when it came out.<br />Other reviewers were saying that T3 doesn't bring anything new to the series and my response to that is... WHAT!!!<br />The first Terminator was scary. The unknown. When that movie came out, we didn't know who the Terminator was. He was this indestructable killing machine. The second Terminator was a special effects masterpiece with a cool story.<br />That being said, the creators of T3 knew they couldn't meet the expectation of T2 special effects or the scares of the original, so they had the common sense to tell a GOOD STORY.<br />In my opinion, Terminator 3 is the best STORY of the three. It delves into the origin of SkyNet, holds emotional impact (thanks to two very good actors, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes) and has a conclusion that no action movie has previously had the balls to deliver.<br />Terminator 3 was a huge win. One of the best movies of the year, crushes The Matrix and I can't wait for the fourth installment!<br />The DVD: cool. Besides dozens of cool behind the scenes featurettes, also allows you into the SkyNet database to explore weapons and personnel and has a visual effects lab where you can build your own special effects sequences.<br />Buy it. If you haven't seen Terminator 3. It's one of the few action movies that won't insult your intelligence.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is metal! For me, the crashing drums, the emotionless guitar riffs, sometimes speeding out into chaos which is paradise, and others where the amazing solos by Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King make the guitars scream like demons themselves really proves the masterful skill Slayer has as musicians.  This is the first Slayer album when Slayer's origion and immortally best drummer, the legend Dave Lombardo introduced his double-bass drum beat, proving this is the fastest and most intense adreniline multiplying metal album ever made. <br />The speed is ungodly, as well are the lyrics. Hearing Tom Araya screaming mad enough to kill is just perfection to this album's intense, ultra agressive, murder metal point of view that gets the adreniline flowing like nothing else and is truly a marvel in its effect on the listener. Heck enough explaining and anylising, if you are an intense metaller, there' not much better other than other Slayer. Slayer albums shoudn't be compared as they each offer something different and perfect and to the true Slyer fanatic, all could be part of one huge Slayer ensomble. Enjoy. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. <br />And for the posers stay away your not welcome in Slayer country.
B00003CXXP|5.0|HJ Osment got an Academy Award nomination for the 6th Sense but he should have gotten an Oscar for his role as the robotchild David in Artificial Intelligence. He is simply brilliant as a robot that always has to be nice and in the end starts looking for a way to become human. Frankenstein, Pinocchio, the Asimov robot novels and Data from Star Trek are all perfect predecessors. His acting becomes even better when he meets a newer version of himself.<br />The story is not new, it is just a modern version of Pinocchio. It also has some sociological comments. In the scene during the robot-rodeo he (and gigolo Robot Jude Law) are almost destroyed but the audience doesn't want a child, even a robot, to die. Somehow no one is expected to kill their own childhood, the dreams have to stay alive, even the dreams of a robot.<br />See it and be amazed
B000002UJQ|4.0|buy The Bends.  It's a better album than OK Computer.  I like OKC very much, but The Bends is better.  There I said it.  Don't rip me apart just b/c you have a different opinion.
B00008EYA5|3.0|S.W.A.T. had potential but falls short in my book.<br />It starts off like it's gonna be a great movie. The performances are good, the tension is good and the story is headed in an interesting direction.<br />But then it sort of gets derailed. Not in a hugely bad way, but in bad enough of a way. First of all, the story is set aside and half of the movie is taken up with TRAINING! Sure, it's neat to see the S.W.A.T. officers at work and good research was done into the weapons and tactics, but the story suffers from this. What could have been a richer and deeper story, becomes a flash in the pan ending with not a whole lot of feeling to it.<br />What could have been an exciting and conflicting story between Jim Street (Farrell) and his ex-partner Brian Gamble (Renner) becomes just a handful of scenes that never got delved into and so the conclusion doesn't hold a lot of power.<br />So, I guess my pain problem with the movie was scripting and structure.<br />It's an interesting movie and worth a look, but falls short of anything more than that.

B0000509C4|3.0|Although Stephen King (who authored the source stories and appears briefly in an episode) and George A. Romero (who wrote the script) are hyped in the advertising, neither contributed much to this latter day sequel (made five years after Creepshow did modest business in theaters and on video), and it shows.  Three stories and a wrap around (instead of five) are offered. Old Chief Woodenhead has an old school cigar store Indian going on a vengeful rampage, The Raft is a variant of The Blob, and the whole thing is almost saved by The Hitchiker, where a hit and run driver is menaced by the unstoppable spectre of the man she swatted with her car (it was this story that Romero had to fall back on if the They're Creeping Up On You episode in Creepshow 1 had proved to be unfilmmable).  Each story (save for the last one) is a passable tale of the macabre far better suited to Laurel's then running Tales from the Darkside television program.  Romero's longtime cinematographer Michael Gornick directed this after cutting his teeth on said TV show, and it shows.  The stories seemed paced with commercial breaks in mind.  While not a complete failure, it is far removed from the fun of the first movie.
B00007LTIC|5.0|Like other reviewers, I think the sound is improved over the 1994 remaster.  However, it still stinks.  Listening to the bonus tracks shows how much better this album could be if remixed and remastered from the original studio tapes.  When they originally mastered this album, they compressed the life out of it.  All subsequent remasterings have improved it, but this album deserves better.<br />Let's hope there's a DVD-Audio or SACD remix in the near future.
B00004VVNB|5.0|Logan's Run is an excellent stylish sci-fi film from 1975 starring the great Michael York and the beautiful Jenny Agutter.<br />It blew my mind seeing it as an 11-year-old and was so obsessed with it my mother used to say, \\"He thinks everything's the 23rd century\\".  Logan 5 (York) is a Sandman who kills runners, people who reach the age of 30, but reject the chance to Renew on Carousel.  As the film begins we see the cool domed city with Jerry Goldsmith's futuristic trippy soundtrack.  In this world mainly filmed in a Fort Worth mall everyone has a life-clock and when they reach 30 it starts to blink red.  Those who believe in renewal attend the Last Day ritual when the 30-year-olds come out with hoods and masks, then \\"Identify...be strong and you will be renewed\\" says the female computer voice.  They disrobe to reveal tights with Evel Knievel designs and start to spin around and float up and blow up to the cheers of the crowd.<br />  Logan and his friend Francis (Richard Jordan) go on a hunt for runners killing them with fire spewing guns.  Then Logan finds an Anck key and the master computer makes him search for Sanctuary by posing as a runner (some reviews of this film say Logan is 30, but he's \\"4-years-away\\", i.e. 26--York was really 32 though).<br />  The best thing about this is the stylish futuristic designs, the great believable acting of the stars, and the off-the-wall nonsensical speech of the senile old man (Peter Ustinov).  And there's some great adventure as Logan and Jessica are chased out of the city by Francis through the labyrinthine subsystems, Box the crazy robot, and a beautiful ice cave scene.  And for us guys our favorite line is \\"we better take our clothes off before they freeze\\", kind of weird that they put them back on, but our wish throughout the film comes true with a quick glimpse of Jenny Agutter disrobed.<br />  The plot itself has some serious inconsistencies.  In the book the age for Renewal was 21, and the author got the idea from '60s youth culture (it was written in 1967).  The idea was that youth would take over and get rid of all adults.  The reason for the change to age 30 is the stars would be unbelievable as 20 year olds.  You have to make many leaps over logic to suspend your disbelief here.  You could say the city used this as population control.  The idea of Renewal, well you can believe in reincarnation, but in this world it's implied Renewal means some scientific process controlled by the computer.  When the computer tells Logan there are 1056 unaccounted for runners he says \\"no one's ever been renewed?!\\"  However his conclusion cannot be logically drawn from information on unaccounted for runners.<br />  In the cool \\"surrogation\\" scene with Logan in multiple hologram images saying \\"There is Noooooo Sanctuary\\", his answer does not compute so the city blows up....or was it his shooting the computer with his gun...or both.  Here's a way to rationalize it though:  the computer has a secret program to destroy the city when someone prefers life outside the dome...forget it, I gave it my best shot.  And how they get outside the city to meet the old man so quickly and without a scratch on them is beyond me.<br />  Bottom line is the film is great not because of the plot, but because of the creativity and style.  It won a special academy award for special effects and it's a true classic.  Michael York still gets people who come up to him telling him Logan's Run was their favorite film of his (even with all the other great roles he's had).from '60s youth culture (it was written in 1967).

B0000C6E4D|4.0|It has been exactly five years since McLachlan released a new album.  In the intervening five years, a lot has affected her personal growth. She lost her mother. In addition, she became a new mother herself. I think this album is good but it takes a while for the listener to become intuned with it. You can feel so much emotion inflected into her words. Fallen is the best anthem on this album. It reaches into your soul and just wrenches at the emotional heart strings.  As you listen to the album more often, it becomes more endearing. I would definitely recommend her latest cd. The music is definitely haunting but speaks to you as an individual as well. We all cope with overwhelming pains and burdens in life. Sarah is humanizing us all.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Because that's exactly where it lands every time I watch any one of these incredibly well done episodes.  There simply are not enough superlatives in the English language to do justice to the unparalleled quality of this production.  Contrary to the misguided opinion of the \\"viewer from San Diego\\" (see below), this is not about glorifying war or depicting the average German soldier as an awful person.  Rather, it's about giving the viewer a rare insight into war in all its horror, confusion and human-ness (is that a word?).  No doubt the Germans had their own \\"bands of brothers\\" -- just read Guy Sajer's \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" for a fine illustration of that.  However, this series doesn't take sides.  It shows both Americans and Germans alike as scared, tired, hungry, cold and confused.  The portrayal of the human and psychological toll of this conflict is not unbalanced, although admittedly the viewer only gets to \\"personally\\" know the characters on the American side.<br /><br />Even while the grim realities of war are highlighted, there is also an acute attention to historical detail and accuracy, right down to some of the minutiae described by the real survivors in Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name.  The series also presents an object lesson in courage, sacrifice and loyalty that is not to be overlooked.  Yes, war is an awful thing, but it also has the ability to bring out hitherto unknown greatness, albeit often subtle, in those who find themselves thrust into the middle of the conflict.  HBO and Spielberg do a wonderful job of striking just the right balance.<br /><br />The central character, the \\"hero\\" if you prefer, is Lt. (later Capt. and then Major) Richard \\"Dick\\" Winters, who is introduced early in Episode 1 as a platoon leader in Easy Company, and later the company commander after his predecessor turns up missing on the D-Day drop.  Winters proves himself an exceptional combat commander and later a highly competent battalion staff officer.  At every stage of his development, his exemplary leadership is underscored by a simple, down-to-earth (humble?) attitude and a deep concern for every soldier under his command.  This is well illustrated in Episode 5 when Winters personally leads his outnumbered men in a charge that catches two full companies of SS infantry by surprise.  The attack decimates the German units while only one of Winters' own men is killed and 22 wounded, yet even still he counts the cost and personally mourns the loss.<br /><br />In addition to the great development of the Dick Winters character (who was, of course, a real person), there is plenty of similar attention given to many others, such as Sgt. Guarnere and Capt. Nixon.  One of the other features that makes this such a great series is the phenomenally skillful camera work.  The positioning of the cameras, the jolt from a nearby artillery rounds, the jostling of men in the trenches, and the constant buzz and smack of bullets, all combine to put the viewer in the middle of the action with the men on the screen.  Frankly I think the ability to capture the \\"atmosphere\\" of combat rises to an even higher level than was demonstrated in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", which set a new standard for modern war films.<br /><br />What more can I say?  Watch these for yourself.  You won't be disappointed -- not even a little bit.  There's no political agenda here.  What you'll see will (or should) give you pause to consider the nature and effects of war, but beyond that it's simply a great story about great men doing their best in an uncertain time.

B00003CWL6|2.0|A corrosive masterpiece, a cruel but realistic portrait of the American family ? No, a movie much more conformist than it seems, full of commonplaces, with an end foregone and unbelievable at the same time. <BR>Only good thing is the level of the acting.
B000094A6A|4.0|There are some retreading in OLD SCHOOL taking parts from such films as ANIMAL HOUSE, BACK TO SCHOOL (Rodney Dangerfield), and BILLY MADISON (Adam Sandler), but the casting and characters is what saves the film and there is some wit, originality and thought written into the script and the characters along with some hilarious moments. Three college buddies (Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, and Will Ferrell) are having trouble adjusting to adult life and have troubled relationships and marriages (even after so many years of being out of college). They take one last stab at youth by turning Mitch's home into a frat house. This due in part from circumstances involving a rezoned area near a college campus which Mitch has moved into after a falling out with his wife.  As his friends keep on coming around (and staying) to cheer him up, they come with with the plan for the frat house. They recruit whomever and not necessarily college students to join the frat house and the party begins. There are subplots for all three of the individual leads. The standout is that of Will Ferrell (formerly of Saturday Night Live) whose character (Frank) sustains a lot of the slapstick and abuse in the film.  Luke Wilson has a restrained and thoughtful performance as the sensitive 'Mitch', and Vince Vaughn as 'Beanie' always has presence as the audio equipment salesman. As stated, there are some original and hilarious moments in the film. One scene involves Mitch (Luke Wilson)as he comes home from work to find his wife, played by Juliet Lewis, involved in a threesome which has very good comic timing. There is a very funny sequence with comic actor Andy Dick as a hired sex therapist of sorts, and lastly there is a hilarious cameo by late night talk show host Craig Kilborn. Overall, a film that proves that something old can be new again, OLD SCHOOL could have been another in a long list of recently bad low-brow comedies, but the film works because of a great cast,a funny script, and some inspired cameos.meos.
B000056NX4|4.0|Let me start off by saying that Jerome Pradon was a wonderful Judas!!!!--way more powerful then Murray Head in the original production. At times Renee Castle (Mary) was a bit flat, and I did't like the fact that they mondernized it. I'm 28 years old and when I was growing up this was the only thing I listend to and I listended to it over and over again, drove my mother nuts sometimes. Oh and one more thing,they butchered King Herod's Song :( That was the only problem I had with it.

B000002UA9|4.0|You must appreciate this album for what it is. It is basically live tracks (recorded in 12 hours) of songs played at Liverpool night clubs in early 1963. The Beatles were one of the first British rock groups to be a given a record, so they were obviously surperior to any of their competetors. No rock 'n' roll music in 1963 was any more complicated; that would only happen over the next couple of years when the Beatles took rock to its greatest heights. These were four kids (George Harrison was only 19)! For a band just starting out, this is a fine album. (And it keeps on getting better from here!)

This book, full of thriller novel might pull out some out the usual themes, but it is the most intelligent book I've probably ever read. You don't have to be a scholar to enjoy this -- heck, I'm a college student who majored in communications...you don't get much more basic than that! Just reading this book made me feel smart, and I did it in 3 days....a record for me! Definately give it a try, you won't be sorry.
B00006CXXU|1.0|This CD is bad. Well, not'bad', but a dissapointment I'll say. The only danceable tracks are obveiously &quot;Dirrty&quot; &quot;Fighter&quot; &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; &quot;Make Over&quot; &quot;I'm Leavi'n&quot; The only problem with this CD is that it is too over produced. In some songs, you can barely hear her voice, so it appears that Christina can't sing, which draws me to a one star rating. Christina can sing,but her attitude twards fellow pop singers is monstrous. That too draws me to my one star rating. Anybody who is that child-like to hate everybody who is the slightest competition should be in grade school still. Her lack of maturity and honor for life is appaling. All of these personality trates show up in her songs,even though the CD was made before the comments were.

Still enjoy listening to anything done by the Beatles though.
B00000DGXN|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD.  I listen to it all the time.   I think all except 2 of the tracks have a really nice happy and relaxed vibe.  And ofcourse, with the stellar musicians involved there's plenty of variety and interesting stuff so that I never get tired of it.  This is nice for something interesting to listen to, or as wonderful background music (always puts me in better spirits) and I also listen to this when I have insomnia, not because it's boring, but it's calming, happy and very cool (at least to me!).  My favorite song is &quot;Country Roads&quot; - really cool version of this!  If everybody listened to this CD I think the world would be a lot happier.  Great CD!
B00005JLYW|2.0|Sorry but Demi Moore cannot act... And the very fact she needed 100K's worth of plastic surgery to make her look &quot;young&quot; again is demeaning to women especially in this day and age where small children start to show signs of eating disorders. Apart from this gripe, which I could put aside as Demi Moore is only one women, but the plot is unsalvageable and only falls further downhill as the movie progesses. This movie may have made money, but not sense. At least in the first movie suspending disbelief was possible (and Sam Rockwell, a great actor, made an amazing villain, unlike Ms Moore and Justin Theroux- he was just too much), but in this one forget it.<BR>On a better note there are some good moments in the film notably when it's doing the comedy thing... maybe thats something to look out for if your forced to watch this movie! Also the leads are good and with a proper villian next time maybe this franchise could be good once again.

B00006690G|5.0|Rapping about killing your mom isn't the same as killing her, well, literally, anyway. Eminem is a rabid rapper who gets carried away with the creative power that his genius can wield, but that is not negative.  <br />This is another brilliant work.  Eminemn has rap at its best, raw and real.  It's life, man.
B0000VAFNQ|3.0|I love Vampires and Werewolves. I thought it would be great to see an original movie where they had battles. The problem with &quot;Underworld,&quot; sadly enough, is it's lack of originality. <br />The &quot;Vampire clans,&quot; the look of the vampires and the action scenes have all been done before in better movies.<br />The &quot;Vampire Clans&quot; idea has been done before in &quot;Kindred The Embraced,&quot; &quot;Blade,&quot; and several &quot;White-Wolf&quot; roleplaying games. The action sequences were unoriginal and uninspired and the clothes that the Vampires wore were just too stereotypical. Why do all the Vampires in modern films have to be covered head-to-toe in leather?<br />I like the movie because I love Vampires and Werewolves but I think the movie would have been a lot better if it had some more originality. This is mainly for the diehard Vampire (or Werewolf) fans. Buy this at the Hollywood Video's &quot;Two for $20.00&quot; sale if you are only a casual action/horror fan.
B000001EYW|3.0|having just listened to it again for the first time in a couple of years but it certainly doesn't merit all these 5 star reviews. With all the different producers working on this album you'd think that at least one would get it right. The vocals have a heavy echo then on top that the music is echoed again which may have sounded alright if the album had come out on vinyl but on CD with Barry Gibbs high voice it sounds tinny. There are a few good lyrics on the album but most of the songs are sugary love songs, perhaps they should have renamed the album stagnent waters. Still it does have some good moments like I Will and My Lovers Prayer hence the 3 stars.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Ok, forget Baby one more time, forget opps i did it again, and multiply I'm a slave 4 U times 5.<BR>\\"In the Zone\\" is a hot CD to dance to.  Its songs are very sexual and upbeat for the most part.<BR>1.  Me against the music (you've all heard it!  It is a great dance tune you will not get tired of.<BR>2.  I've got that Boom Boom (it's a very sexy mix of rap, hip-hop, and dance)<BR>3.  Showdown  (very sexual dance song \\"will you undo my zipper please?\\" asks britney<BR>4.  breath on me (again sexual)<BR>5.  Early Mornin' (a fun upbeat tune)<BR>6.  Toxic  (My personal favorite.  A great dance tune that is nothing like normal pop.)<BR>7.  Outrageous  (written by R. Kelly, so you know its hot!)<BR>8.  Touch of my hand  (sexy and strong britney!)<BR>9.  The Hook Up  (I think the title explains this one!)<BR>10. Shadow (one of the two ballads on this album.  Non-sexual!  A sweet song that reminds you of \\"don't let me be the last to know\\"<BR>11.  Brave New Girl (a techoish dance song.  I'd say its not the greatest, but its cool.  I think britney is trying to rap!)<BR>12. Everytime  (A great ballad!  A sweet song about needing someone...a[...])<BR>13.  Me Against the music remix ( i don't like this remix...you might)<br />anyway, overall this CD is very good.  It's like the Cd, Britney, but even more sexual and more upbeat.  Most of the songs are good or very good, so i would say this is a good buy!
B00000K19E|5.0|Do we choose what we are going to do or are we fated to do what we do? Is there fate or is there freewill?<br />This is a really complex question that is not easy to answer. The Matrix trilogy really attacks this question head-on and it never really leaves you with a definite answer. It makes you really think about everything that you have ever seen or done in your life and it leaves you with so many moral and philosophical questions. The people that hate the Matrix movies hate it because they can only see what is on the surface. They see people in funny black costumes flying around doing kung-fu. They don't ever see how deep and philosophical the films (or the characters) truly are.<br />I appreciate the Matrix and the Matrix sequels because they truly are the \\"thinking-man's\\" action films. The people that like The Matrix and dislike the sequels aren't really the true fans. They fail to see \\"how deep the rabbit hole truly goes.\\"<br />I think The Matrix series is THE BEST Sci-Fi/Fantasy series ever. I think it's deeper than the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings films will ever be.<br />This film is the film that started it all. Buy it and it will truly open your mind. You will be thinking about it for days after you see it. It truly is excellent.
0553213105|5.0|The book Pride And Prejudice is a very good novel; it takes place during the 19th century, when women were inferior to men. The title of the novel Pride And Prejudice has an actual meaning in the story that describes the main characters. This novel has some similarities to today's society in various ways.<br /> The meaning of the title describes the personality of Darcy and Elizabeth. Darcy had the personality of being proud, and Elizabeth was very prejudiced. The reason Darcy had that personality was because he was a wealthy man who didn't associate with people who were from a lower social class. He didn't have the confidence to tell Elizabeth that he liked her because of his pride. Elizabeth was really prejudiced because before she met people, she distrusted them. Elizabeth thought Darcy's love for her wasn't real when it actually was true. I think the way that Darcy and Elizabeth were acting was foolish because pride and prejudice are not good things to have. It causes problems among people.<br /> In the story the strong one was actually the woman because she did not let him play with her and that attracted Darcy to Elizabeth.<br />. Chapter three appealed to me because that was the beginning of all of the misunderstanding in the novel, which made it interesting for the readers to read.  The sparks lit up in that chapter. The pride and prejudice of Darcy and Elizabeth started and kept on getting worse throughout the novel because even though they felt an attraction for each other they had misunderstanding that made them have bad feelings. But like all stories it always has a solution at the end. I liked the misunderstanding because it kept on make me feel a great suspense that made me want to keep on reading to find the answer, especially when Darcy asked Elizabeth to dance and was rejected by her. This part of the chapter was the best part because it life me with questions about what was going to happen later in the story with them, and it also confused me because I didn't think that they were going to end up marrying at the end.<br />I liked this book a lot.  It is one of my favorite books right now. The rating that the critics gave this book was a wise decision, five stars, because it was well written and interesting. This book is appropriate for people in the age of 14 and up. If you like to read suspense novels, you will like this novel.
0385504209|5.0|I'll make this quick.  While not great literature, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is an excellent read.  I could not put it down, and a week after finishing reading it, it is still stuck in my head. Basically, the curator of the Louvre is murdered but leaves clues before dying for a Harvard codebreaker and his granddaughter.  Code and puzzle lovers will be fascinated by this book.  The clues left lead the two characters on a search for the Holy Grail.<br />Dan Brown writes in enough twists and cliffhangers for four novels, so the novel moves at breakneck speed.  At the same time, he takes the time to explain religious history and conspiracy, something I had read about in the excellent &quot;Eve's Seed.&quot;  Anyway you look at it, this is fascinating stuff.<br />Overall...an easy, completely fun read that still delivers the smarts!
B000001ESP|5.0|Life changes occur every 7 years. By age fourteen, my life was under assault. I was in a new city and a new school. High school was intimidating, and my study skills were lousy. On top of that, my parents had split up, puberty was raging, and I was unprepared to deal with women, family, school, fights, adults, and authority. I was getting into small-scale troubles like shoplifting. My self-esteem was shot, exacerbated by pimples and the standard teasing. It was 1982.<br />Into this social and personal morass came \\"Tom Sawyer\\", the first rock single I ever paid attention to and the most important. Being black, I was used to R&B/soul/funk. Now I realize that the uninformed, uninitiated listener can find much about Rush to criticize, but to me, \\"Tom Sawyer\\" was a clarion call and a rallying cry. By the 3rd time I heard it on the radio, I had to buy the album (remember those?). When I was able to collect enough money (about $8.00 - remember that?), I went to the record store and was transfixed by the cool looking cover. I didn't get the depth of the cover concept - the \\"moving pictures\\" inside joke, but the surface appealed. Notice the gothic architecture, the recutrring theme of 3, the Clockwork Orange-looking men moving pictures, the burning witch, the black/red satanic lettering, and the 'bad seed-looking' little girls with their parents? Rush were the master manipulators here - luring teens in to ponder what evil lurks underneath, while affirming the teen desire to rebel, to piss off your folks, thereby reclaiming your desire for power. Then you turn it around and it's literally and figuratively the reverse - no evil intents, just a film shoot - a motion pic shoot. It's still one of the all-time greatest album covers for me. <br />Then the inner sleeve offers those oh-so-cool pose pix of them in motion laying down some of the wickedest and hardest music in rock. I was held captive to the stereo system with the first track, \\"Tom Sawyer\\". Another reviewer questioned why it was first on the album. He may as well ask why a the door to a building is on the first floor. It literally is a song intended for an audience like me then. Figuratively, it became the soundtrack for my teenage life. It suggests a dark, aloof cynicism, and a preternatural desire to avoid conformity. It has a sound that is singular, distinct, and unique. The middle keyboard part that morphs into that intense jam is like a drug trip. There is an obvious love of technical proficience, a holdout for artistic quality, and a very masculine love for gadgetry and technology. It tows the line between European lyricism and the African hypnotic beat. It also was complete - the images, words, rhythms, ideas all were dynamic and interplaying, and justified the high art of production. And it covered a wide spectrum of sound - the puglistic punches and the shimmering, brassy crashes of the percussion. That impossible-to-duplicate fat, distorted bass sound. I still marvel at Geddy's vocal performance on this record. Lifeson's solos in \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Red Barchetta\\", and \\"Limelight\\" are classic, yet all of his work is incredible here. His effects are equally incredible - the digital delay ending his solo in \\"Limelight\\", and his dead-on 'shrieking tires' starting his solo in 'Barchetta'. That's one of those moments that make your arm hairs stand up. It's one of many moments on this album where you realize you're listening to true artists who have thought long and hard on how to manipulate our senses for a desired effect. <br />Then there's that feeling that you are a witness to the recording (just what are they whispering to each other before the solo of \\"Camera Eye?\\"). Read the credits and you'll note the album was recorded digitally - in fact they're probably the FIRST to do it - 4-5 years before CDs became the norm. And that production had a strangeness to it - a haunting sense of light and shade, like an Ansel Adams photograph. <br />Rush were a breath of fresh air for me. Iwanted to be a part of the cool trip they were on then. I began to teach myself the drums, and I proceeded to collect every one of their albums and I studied them like a monk studying the New Testament. In 2 years I began to master Peart's power, and subsequently I discovered the Police, Zep, Iron Maiden, Yes, Ozzy, etc. I became a rock student and a musician, dabbling with the bass and the guitar. <br />So thank you, Rush. This album was the raft on the Mississippi for me. I was Huck and I was Jim, and the drumsticks were my paddles.
B00005T343|5.0|The replacement of Jodie Foster (Silence of the Lambs)with Julianne Moore in the role of Clarice Starling, an FBI agent framed to lure Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) out of hiding, intensifies the attraction between the two. Lector, an insane cannibalistic pyschopath who nevertheless possesses a genius level intelligence, uses grotesque methods of vengenance with a wit and humor to avenge those who plot against both he and Clarice. The film has moments of gore, but it's never boring and the tension intensifies as the film climaxes in a surprise ending. Although the ending differs from that of Thomas Harris' novel, it, nevertheless, is compelling and leaves the viewer asking for yet another sequel.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of my sons friends brought &quot;Firefly the Complete Series&quot;<BR>over on Christmas, and suggested we might like it. 4 of the 5 of us like good science fiction.  Notice i said &quot;good&quot;.  After <BR>seeing the just two of the first disk episodes, i thought&quot;This got cancelled?&quot;  ( I bought the disk on saturday and watched all the episodes by Sunday evening)Josh must have made some executive mad cause he is so talented.  To cancel a series that a year later, when out on DVD, has Amazon sell out the preorder in 24 hours is remarkable.  I know that you will enjoy this series if you like Sci-Fi like  Stargate SG-1, Enterprise, Star Trek the Next Generation, etc..   I give Josh's series two thumbs up. I can't wait to see the Movie next year.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The very concept of an extended edition is awesome.  Peter Jackson has set a new standard for future DVDs.  The Two Towers Extended edition is much better that The Fellowship.

B000088E6D|5.0|I hadn't heard much about Michael Buble until I watched the Dateline special on him earlier this year. Besides the fact that he is absolutely amazing to look at (especially when he sings), his voice sounded excellent, so I got his CD for my mother for Christmas. Problem is I haven't been able to give it to her yet because I haven't been able to stop listening! I was completely blown away.  He sings with the wisdom and talent of those who sang these great songs before him. He has an amazing voice. Don't be caught off guard by the song list and think that this is a cover album. He definitely brings his own flavor to these songs.  This album is wonderfully fresh and new and I absolutely love it!  :)
B00005JMCW|5.0|I am generally apprehensive regarding remakes because they are often inferior to the original.  I avoided this movie in the theaters for that reason.  Eventually we got the DVD and I gritted my teeth to watch.  To my surprise the remake covers new territory in switch films and was quite enjoyable.<br />As with the original, the interplay is between mother Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Annabell Coleman (Lindsay Lohan).  However, in the original the daughter, played by Jodi Foster, was the stronger of the two roles and the mother just didn't quite spark my interest after the switch.  In this movie both characters play well and Jamie Lee Curtis proves once again what a great actress she is.<br />The best part of the movie is that the update is very modern.  Annabell is faced with motorcycle riding hunks, is a member of a hard rock group, and wants to get more piercings.  The character of Annabell is wonderfully rebellious yet not completely out of control.<br />As with most teens, Annabell and her mother are arguing about something constantly.  With a bit of Asian magic, and a rather tricky fortune cookie, mother and daughter switch bodies.  The switch itself is hilarious.  One of the scenes played in advertisements continuously is when Annabell, now in Tess' body, says that she's the Crypt Keeper.  Jamie Lee Curtis is perfectly believable after the transition.<br />We soon find that each really struggles with the other's world.  Annabell can't keep up with all her mother's cell phones, PDA, and beeper.  Further, driving seems to be quite a challenge for her.  Tess discovers that her daughter was telling the truth about the English teacher who is continually out to get her, regardless of how well she does.  It turns out that the English teacher and Tess know each other.  Tess solves Annabell's problem quite nicely.  However, Tess still has other problems, particularly with Annabell's friends.  The peak of Tess' problems are during a rock audition that is very important to Annabell.<br />There are additional conflicts for the pair to add even more spice.  Tess is preparing to get married to Ryan (Mark Harmon), who is trying to understand his soon to be daughter but, as with many fathers, is more than a little clueless.  Annabell also has a younger brother that she sees as a pest.  The switch allows candid conversations between Annabell and Ryan and Annabell and younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) where Annabell learns that Ryan doesn't want to upset her life and truly wants to understand her and Harry loves her and admires her.  The poignant moments are handled quite well with minimal schmaltz.<br />The true point of the movie is for each to walk in the other's shoes.  In the process of doing so we get to see some well done physical and situational comedy, most particularly by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Both Tess and Annabell are both empathetic characters.  While the focus is on the ladies, making this a mother-daughter film, males will enjoy the generational myopia of mother and daughter.  A wonderful family film that I consider suitable for most family members.ortant to Annabell.<br />There are additional conflicts for the pair to add even more spice.

0380789019|2.0|I began reading this book and was thrilled. The opening scenes and character introductions promised a wild romp through a marvelously dark fantasyland existing under the modern streets of London. However, as I continued reading I became less and less impressed. Gaiman fails to fully develop any of his characters. Each is marched in, fulfilling a specific purpose, i.e. unlikely hero made heroic by his involvement with a magical heroine, irreverent but lovable sidekick, brave protector, brutal villians, etc. There is also a slew of brief appearances by various people &amp; animals who come and go so quickly I wonder why they are even mentioned. With the exception of the Marquis, I found I didn't care about any of them. I was also surprised by the brevity of climactic events such as the slaying of the dreaded Beast. It's all over so quickly. &quot;That's it?&quot; I find myself thinking. <BR>I did enjoy the premise and I am glad I finished it. It does pick up towards the end. But if you're looking for a really absorbing fantasy book with characters you won't soon forget and events that are clearly emblazoned in your memory, I'd strongly suggest reading the George R. R. Martin &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; books.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Will Farrell alone is a great reason to buy this movie, he is soo hillarious. Many funny parts.
B00005JMCN|3.0|Like \\"Radio\\" or some other uplifting, compassion-for-the-challenged melodrama, \\"Seabiscuit\\" is not so much a movie to feel good about horses as it is a movie to feel good about ourselves - the titular thoroughbred doesn't make his entrance in the first hour of Gary Ross's sun-dappled gloss and, afterward, is merely a muse for ego-inflated history lessons.  For lovers of \\"Pharlap\\" and \\"The Black Stallion,\\" - or Laura Hillenbrand's book, for that matter - it is a letdown. <br />As in the book, \\"Seabiscuit\\" opens with a short history of the automobile in early 1920s (nicely narrated by historian David McCullough) that brings us to Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges, doing a hammy riff on his performance in \\"Tucker\\") an engine pioneer who builds a fortune off the machine -and symbolically uses his horse stable as a garage - before losing his young son (in an auto accident! and only because the six-year-old knew how to drive!) and plunging into a shadowed dispair mirroring the 1929 Wall Street collapse. <br />Parallel stories develop the plights of horse trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), who stands by a newly built road in the West and knows he's lost the frontier, and jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) who fights his oversized frame and rotten luck while partaking in back-barn brawls for room and board money. Howard meets Smith at a campfire. Smith meets Red at a stable. <br />Then, out of the racetrack mist one morning, comes Seabiscuit. <br />There wasn't much to the horse; despite his extrodinary pedigree - he was cousin to future rival War Admiral, and grandson to Man O'War - he was small and lazy, and, by 4 years old, ornery. Yet Seabiscuit had wild, unbridled strength, as if his larger ancestors had packed their spirits into his body, and he won races by stalking down speed horses, then demoraliziong the hard-chargers. <br />Smith saw that quality, and the movie, at times, sees it too. It's just buried under director Ross's need to tell the \\"larger\\" story of a broken America, match it up to a broken Howard  - who applies his \\"finish line is the future\\" analogy so many times you yearn for the deep past - then match up Seabiscuit to Red, played unconvicingly by Maguire. <br />Ross triples back to reinforce themes of perseverance, sacrifice and struggle, then measures each of Seabiscuit's races with the same rising orchestral score that booms and cheers at victory. There is extrordinary amount of fat begging to be trimmed. A horrible Elizabeth Banks, as Howard's wife, inhabits the little kid role - she certainly looks like one - existing solely to stand open-mouthed while hitting up Red and Smith for reactions to the horse. And William H. Macy, in a cameo as a radio announcer, takes his cues from Ross and pounds the same gimmick-laden routine into the dry earth. Only Cooper, and jockey Gary Stevens in the movie's best performance as Red's friend/rival George Wolff, seem to be in a Horse Movie; they understand that subtle awe and companionship works better than sales hamming (Bridge) and boyish yelping (Maguire). <br />\\"Seabiscuit\\" does manage to capture some of the excitement of the War Admiral duel, as Howard challenges the Triple Crown winner's legendary owner, Samuel Riddle (Eddie Jones, nicely taciturn), on a whistlestop tour around the country. Howard gets his race, though Red is hurt in an accident and doesn't get the ride. After Seabiscuit wins with a surge in the final turn, he's hurt in a later race, and, wouldn't you know it - horse and Red rehabilitate one another for one last hurrah in the big Handicap. <br />These scenes, and others, would be more powerful were they not chopped into two-minute soundbites, of which the entire movie seems comprised. Ross bleeds Hillenbrand's book dry of the facts while leaving its essence on the page: Every race is more about the jockeys than the horses, every win more about its effect on \\"the people\\" than the glory of the beast. The War Admiral scene proves it, cutting from the very startof the duel to a still photo of folks listening to the race out of a vehicle. Yes, it's irony, but who cares? \\"Seabiscuit\\" is far too impressed with its own term paper.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is a great movie and the dvd is the best , there is humore for all ages and all will enjoy.
B00005JMGC|3.0|\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is the type of female vanity piece that has to wink at its subject - in this case, smart Wellesey College girls caught in an era of intellectual oppression - to cater to the theater herd. The movie's telling a smarter story than it seems to, but it's buried underneath playing nice to all the types of women staring back from the seats. <br />Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts, who also produced) is a liberal California art history professor bent on suceeding at Wellesley, then (and still) one of the premier colleges solely for young women. Her reception is cold: The students have memorized the textbook, and her boarder (Marcia Gay Harden) is an elocution instructor ten years ahead of the spinster curve. The college, and the community, is fixated on finding husbands, serving them, then living through them; indeed, this well-off crowd, their mothers having missed their days as Rosie The Riverter, were just beginning to see they could, as Katherine says, \\"bake their cake and eat it too.\\" <br />Through Katherine's teaching of the modern, \\"subversive\\" artists (well, just Picasso and Pollack),  two of the principal senior students - ugly duckling Connie (Gennifer Goodwin) and do-gooder Joan (Julia Stiles) - to begin unthaw, while the shrewd-but-repressed Betty (Kirsten Dunst) initially rebels, and loose Giselle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), better suited to the Roaring 20s, inhabits the self-destructive-yet-wiser-than-her-years role, essentially carrying on as she had before. <br />Director Mike Newell's rendering of the era, replete with maypoles and hula hoop races, is nearly perfect, and the supporting performances, save Dominic West's turn as yet another sleazy-but-alluring cad, settle the film. Roberts dials down her appearance and acting - she still looks pretty fantastic -and is alarmingly content to let her \\"girls\\" steal the movie. <br />Alas, the quartet is not always up to it, specifically Stiles, whose performance is a letdown on par with her character's questionable decision to skip law school and cater to a pasty businessman (Topher Grace). Dunst's Betty, closest in personality to the prideful, demanding Katherine, is forced into an unconvincing conversion after several sharp, tense scenes with her teacher. Gyllenhaal's Giselle has nowhere to go and Goodwin's Connie goes where too many movies have already been; both should have been cut from this movie, but that would have left the floozies and wallflowers of the crowd without an archetype to follow. <br />So \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" becomes, then, a grand \\"it takes all kinds\\" tour of women's wants/dreams/needs without really settling on anything. Roberts is restrained by the script in key moments and forced to embrace Joan and Giselle, even though neither seems particularly strong or insightful, while warring with Betty until a hollow reconciliation. She is also needlessly girly in several scenes, as well; her intellectual wisdom is cloaked by apparent enjoyment in the \\"dame dishing\\" of the day. This is what they call the \\"luminous\\" woman, brilliant by day, drunkard and dancer by night. Search all day and night for Katherine's darker corners; aside from a few bad choices in men, you're not going to find any. No doubt Roberts would like to be this woman; I'd wager she's closer to her \\"Notting Hill\\" character instead. <br />Every one of \\"the girls\\" disappear for stretches at a time, and some point they stop having the brains to talk out their positions, and merely allow their actions to speak: This one gets married, this one drags hard on a cigarette, this one bites her mister's lower lip at the jazz concert. And after a smattering of art in hour one, Katherine's subject matter is shoved aside for her greater talents of mentoring and topical rumination. It has been said that a great teacher makes you love the subject; by the end of \\"Mona Lisa Smile,\\" the only thing the Wellesley girls love is Katherine. That emotion works on some level, too, but you get the feeling that, Betty aside, the students will instead look to their men rather than themselves come the Kennedy/Nixon election.

Don't miss songs like &quot;See You When You're 40&quot; or my favourite one, &quot;See The Sun&quot;, including a striking hidden track. Let you invade by Dido's world. 10 out of 10.
0790729970|4.0|Carrey continues his rep and this time with a original type of movie a greta buy!
0783226063|2.0|I remember being so excited to see the movie adaption of my favorite SciFi classic.  It was disappointing . . . almost a caricature of the book and not at all what was conjured up in my mind, at least.  Do yourself a favor if you are a Dune fan . . . Get the Scifi Channel's version, which I thought was amazingly done, and is a much more faithful version of Dune.
6305252521|2.0|I was really surprised when i saw that the average was 4.5 stars after 396 reviews. I didnt like this movie at all and im a big fan of JC but it wasnt JC the plot was somewhat interesting but besides that it was pretty boring.
B000089RVX|5.0|As a 30 yr old fan of main-stream &quot;alternative&quot; rock (of which I hate the genre title) I must say this is one INCREDIBLE CD!  This album is raw emotion coupled with a sensitive yet edgy sound.  For those who enjoy music for its artistic impression this is THE sound.  Amy Lee's voice will stop your heart and take you inside her head leaving you waiting for her next breath of song. In a sea of whining, leftover, grunge rejects and wannabees this sound is far deeper and meaningful than the teen herds give them credit.  Evanescence is not just another Linkin Park, Godsmack, or (dare I say) Fred Durst...they actually get what rock music is about, and clearly show how music, even &quot;alternative&quot;, can really move and inspire.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I'm a 14 year old male and i listen to rock music and watch tv shows likes the simpsons and watch funny movies. Im not much into musicals at all but i actually enjoyes this movie. I was kind of forced to watch it too. The songs were pretty catchy and some were funny.Great!
B0000CABBW|5.0|Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is the only grandchild of a Maori chief, and when he states that he will begin training the male first-born of the tribe to replace him, she doesn't accept this verdict, but quietly and confidently sets about learning the skills she will need and proving to everyone but him that she is the right person for the job. Will he eventually come around? Considering this is considered a &#34;feel good&#34; movie and &#34;female empowerment&#34; film, chances are he will, but how this comes about is worthwhile and entertaining. Castle-Hughes is outstanding at the head of a great cast. This is a great film for the family or anyone interested in other cultures.<br /><br />DVD extras include featurettes about filming, building the waka (ceremonial canoe) and the soundtrack; commentary with writer-director Niki Caro; 8 deleted scenes; trailer and tv spot; and stills.  The film can be heard only in English but subtitled in English or Spanish.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X men was an ok movie definitley one all should see but X2 is one all should own, many new characters are introduced and there way more of a story line and alot more action.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is a fun 2-CD set if for no other reason than that you get to hear more of the Beatles. The story behind it is that Phil Spector gave the original release his &#34;Wall of Sound&#34; touch and now it's been stripped down and simplified. Interestingly, I found I liked some of the cuts here much better (Dig A Pony, Two of Us, the title cut), some cuts I thought were quite nice on both the original and this new version (I Me Mine, For You Blue) and a few I liked better on the original album (Long and Winding Road).  Undoubtedly you will find your own way in this regard. Anyway, it is absolutely lovely to have some &#34;new&#34; material from the lads to pop in the player.<br /><br />A second disk is included, which contains 21 minutes of song snippets and bits of conversation.  It is quite disjointed but still interesting.  Some of it can be found in the film made of the recording sessions, and the booklet includes an informative introduction, transcripts from the original Let It Be book, and an index of the material on the bonus disk.<br /><br />If you're a Beatles fan, you will want to add this to your collection; if you love music, you will find some tunes and versions here to make you happy; purists will probably not be amused.
B00005JKZV|5.0|although the first LOTR was a great movie i think this one was better, there was more action and more of a story cant wait for the 3rd one! BUY!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|My 16 yo son and I had to cheat.  After watching the movie, we had to watch the last 15 minutes again with the director's commentary on so we figure out what had happened.  Naturally, we then had to watch the movie all over again to see how it fit together.  This movie drags you deeper and deeper into the main character's world even when both you and the character are not sure what's real.  It all seems to make some bizaar linear sense until the very end when it all seems to unravel.  Has the character gone completely insane?  Have you gone completely insane?  Hard to know.  My son recognized many of the younger stars.  I (55 yo) recognized only the mother (president's wife from &quot;Independence day&quot;).  If you like your movies to engage and involve you then this is one you should not miss.
B00000K19E|5.0|Definitely a wierd confusing &quot;What the heck is happening&quot; movie but its different, and after watching it a couple times and you understand it, youll truly enjoy it. (4.5 stars)
B00005JM0B|5.0|I've read the reviews and I think most of them are wrong.  This is a great continuation to the Terminator series.  OK so this is not James Cameron.  It is still the continuation of the story and it drives it home with a vengence.  I don't want to waste time on the two terminators or the special effects, this is a story about destiny and whether our paths are already plotted out for us or not.  We find out, along with the main character, that no matter what road he took, he was always heading toward the same destiny.  The end was truly remarkable as what we thought was going to be a wizz-bang hurry and destroy the stuff ending turned out to be much much more.  I'm really looking forward to the next one.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|To me, At the Drive-In was the most amazing band that I have ever heard.  I think that any new emo/punk/rock/hardcore band will never match At The Drive-In at their prime.  PLEASE COME BACK TOGETHER!!!!!   PLEASE!!   LET THE WORLD HEAR THIS GREATNESS ONCE AGAIN.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I am a believer and will remain a believer even though I do not know every single name that Mytique saw on the computer printout (I do know Remy, however).  It was also great to get a brief view of beast and colossus (kind of gets us salivating for the next one) but real X-men fans can tell you the pleasures and disappointments of each and ever character.  This is not a movie you see once.  This demands repeated viewings just so you can get it all straight.  With question like; &quot;Why didn't Lady blackhawk and Wolverine know each other&quot; you know that there is some controversy here.  If you don't have a scorecard then just ask your kids or just enjoy the ride.
B000066NW0|4.0|I reviewed this album last year when the hype was still going strong and after I had only listened to it a couple times...further reason why you should listen to an album more than once before reviewing.<br />So, Avril Lavigne's image is irritating and rather stupid. I am first to admitt that. But this chick is extremely talented. And now that that the hype that was chocking everyone back in 2002 has died, this album is very pleasant to listen to...even the overplayed tracks. The big hits were &quot;Complicated&quot; which hit #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; *hit #10* and &quot;I'm With You&quot; *hit #3.* Avril's music was actually a nice change of pace from the hip hop dominated radio waves. Especially &quot;I'm With You&quot; which is a very strong ballad. &quot;Losing Grip&quot; was a single too, but didn't as hot. It's an Ok song....a bit more rock-ish as is &quot;Unwanted.&quot; Some of my favorites are songs that weren't even singles. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; are awesome, but my two favorites are definitely &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; and &quot;My World.&quot; These would've been great singles. The big loser of &quot;Let Go&quot; is &quot;Nobody's Fool.&quot; Sorry Avril, but please don't rap.<br />I think Avril can continue to be successful on her sophomore album. I just hope she ditches the teenage punk image. The novalty is gone and it wasn't even that great to begin with. Avril's music is good enough to distinguish her.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I'm not sure why I'm even writing this review except to be able to say to the viewing public how much of an historical film making event this trilogy is.  LOTR has replaced the &quot;star wars&quot; trilogy and the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; trilogy as the voice of this era in film making.  &quot;Masterpiece&quot; is a word too often thrown around by those who shouldn't be throwing it around but in this case I guess I'll be one of those people.  The two towers will stand up under it's own feet but it has the thankless task of having the job of being the second movie in a trilogy that's basically design to hold the other two pieces together.  It not only does this in spectacular form but it also manages to propell us into the third film with Sean Austin's stirring, stirring speech at the end.  People will talk about these films forever and with good, good reason.
B00000373U|5.0|Okay, So this was the first Elliot Smith Album I bought, mostly on a whim at the suggestion of a friend of mine. I'm very glad that I did lay down the cash to pick this one up. It's sad that I should begin listening to Elliot Smith with such an awe inspiring album, even sadder that I got into him posthumously. This one is definitely inspiring, with a pleasantness that belies a deeper melancholy. Lyrically, it develops beyond the simple angst ridden drivel that is so commonplace in music these days. This album presents old themes and ideas about forlorn love and whatnot in a very flavorful way. If you had to make the Simon and Garfunkel comparison, I'd say that it compares more favorably to Paul Simon post S &amp; G. However, none of the songs have the poppy hook that is prevalent in Simon's work.  I notice that I'm managing to write a lot without really saying anything, but you need to experience this to understand. It's a classic. RIP Elliot, such romantics are too beautiful too live
B0000E1ALR|3.0|Springsteen usually puts out quality.  I have been a fan long enough and have all his albums and then some.  However this piece of $#!t should be stricken from the collection.  The third disc is the specific reason why.  The sound quality is poor.  It sucks.  The tracks are not clean and well played.  I have heard bootlegs better.  Granted I will keep this album because it has such valuable tracks for all must have fans.  This album sucks by all other means.  Sony really dropped the ball on this one.
B000005H7D|5.0|This is another Album in the vein of Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, that belongs in everyone's music collection regardless of whether they like Jazz or not. Echoing the sentiments of others, it is not the revolutionary work characteristic of Coltrane's other works, but it remains just plain cool. From the opening measures of the title track, you know that you are in for a fun, very chill ride. The album is kinda like Errol Flynn, James Dean, or even Paul Newman... cool without trying to be.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This film was one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen.  I watched it over 3 days in my health class.  This movie really shows how drugs affect one.  The drugs that people become addicted to are not always illegeal.  Each one of my classmates left the classroom being moved by this movie.  We have all been told that drugs are evil, but I think this movie made a real impact on us.  Hopefully its message will last longer than 10 minutes.
B00006LI4S|5.0|If you must choose between David Gilmour's DVD or Roger Waters' DVD, I would recommend Gilmour's.  His musicianship is impeccable.  If you are really sensitive, you might be distracted by his disheveled appearance on most of the tracks.  Just close your eyes and let sterling guitar, the music, and that voice take you away and back.  While I own both, and really enjoy Waters' work and voice, from a purely musical standpoint, you are better served by David Gilmour.  His singing of Shakespeare's sonnet is worth the price of the DVD by itself.<br />An absolute masterpiece.
B00001ZWTT|4.0|Best:<br />1) The villian is riotously played by Kenneth Branagh using an over-the-top southern accent. He wants to undo the south's surrender in the U.S. Civil War by taking over all of America and dissolving the union. The way he chooses to do it is simply outrageous.<BR>2) The 80 foot, coal-powered mechanical tarantula was downright cool to watch and the sound effects made it seem real.<BR>3) There's a large array of James Bond type gizmos used all throughout the movie (by the good and bad guys alike) that are extremely imaginative.<BR>4) Parts of the film were absolutely hilarious (like the guy with the horn stuck in his ear) and the humor blended well with the action.<BR>5) You get to see the butts of both Salma Hayek and Bai Ling (ha).<BR>6) There's a ton of special features - everything you could want.<br />Worst:<br />1) As much as I like Will Smith, the choice of him for the lead role of was just - weird. A slick-dressing, gun-slinging, smug-acting black man walking around freely so soon after the ending of slavery was pretty unlikely in that time period (but then, so is an 80 foot mechanical tarantula, I suppose). He did, however, create that really catchy theme song - hmm.<br />Recommendation:<br />The movie is delightful, the DVD is loaded with special features and the price is right. Get it and watch without any offbeat expectations - it'll grow on you.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|This is a very good record.  Alicia's singing has made significant strides since &quot;Songs in A Minor,&quot; and the musicianship is still there in spades.  There is no questioning the woman's talent.<br />How is her songwriting?  Nice.  She basically writes about stuff that she knows; female empowering songs about respect and love.  It would be silly to expect Stevie Wonder type songs about poverty or spirituality, that isn't the vibe she's on right now, at least with this record.  She'll get there.<br />This record solidifies Alicia as a major player and should set the stage for continued growth and exploration.  I'm looking forward to the trip and will most definitely reserve a spot.<br />Bravo Alicia!
B000002UB3|5.0|I can't say more about it, just that it's perfect from the first sound to the last. Anyone who didn't give it a five, listen to it again!!! Are you even hearing it??? Oh man, those KILLER basslines, the harmonies, everything! No one will tell me that it gets any better than this. No way for even Sgt. Pepper's, that's a blaster, too, but a bit too eclectic. This flows like it's been put together by... well, by the Beatles (at their best)! Nobody ever will create such a masterpiece (yes, I know the works of Pink Floyd and Zep, but no chance for them )).<BR>Buy it, listen to it, and feel like you're outta this owrld! Perhaps it'll need more than one listens, it's not like cheap pop music that grabs you at the first listen then becomes just simply boring. This album is an ageless classic!
B00005U1YO|5.0|My introduction to techno/electronica music arrived with the Chemical Brothers \\"Exit Planet Dust\\" CD. I read the review in \\"Rolling Stone,\\" liked what I read, purchased the disc and loved it from the first play. Since then I've aquired \\"Dig Your Own Hole,\\" \\"Surrender\\" and \\"Come with Us.\\" All are excellent albums but my favorite is the latter. I'm not sure exactly why. Maybe the last aquired is my favorite because I'm just a little burned out by playing the others so much.<br /><br />\\"Come With Us\\" is a terrific album. Usually I like to note the best songs first and then get down to the ones I care the least about. Well, let's reverse it on this one. I don't particularly care for Chemical Brothers songs having extensive vocals. Thus \\"The State We're In\\" and \\"The Test\\" are my least favored tunes on this disc. They aren't bad songs; I just don't care for them as much as the others. Having said this, all other tracks on this disc are incredibly good. Wonderful dance music! Complex polyrhythyms are intricately interwoven with wonderfully hooky melodic lines on all songs. The best way to listen and appreciate the music, of course, is by dancing to it. And what an experience that can be! I'm unable to choose a favorite selection. Perhaps \\"Come With Us,\\" \\"It Began in Africa,\\" \\"Star Guitar\\" or \\"My Elastic Eye\\" might garner my vote, but \\"Galaxy Bounce,\\" \\"Hoops,\\" \\"Denmark\\" and \\"Pioneer Skies\\" wouldn't be far behind. Now, if I could just get rid of those two tracks with vocals and perhaps add a couple such as \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" and \\"Lost in the K-Hole\\" from the \\"Dig Your Own Hole\\" disc, I'd have a perfect Chemical Brothers CD.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B00005Y7GQ|2.0|This was to be a present for my 3 soccer-playing children; they saw the trailers for the American PG release, but we didn't get a chance to see it in theaters.  I decided NOT to let the two younger children watch this DVD after previewing it with my sensitive 13-year-old.<BR>This DVD version is subtitled (very poorly i.e. &quot;kick the soccer&quot; referring to the soccer BALL, etc., and some of the translation doesn't make any sense.)  There is a lot of footage of adults grovelling at the feet of bad-guys and taking a lot of (depressing) abuse.  There are smokers, drunks, and the &quot;Evil Team&quot; soccer players are injected with HUGE amounts of drug to be powerful.<BR>There is some humor, but not enough.  The good parts are at the very end in the soccer tournament; the Shaolin-style is fun to watch, like in &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot;.<BR>This may be your thing, but I didn't know what I was getting, so I wanted to make sure others do!
B000002MTR|4.0|At the time this album came out, many thought it was a dissappointment.  John Frusciante left the group, and with him sinking further and furthur into drug abuse, it looked like he'd never return.  Now in the year 2004, of course Frusciante kicked his drug habits, rejoined the band and released two of the best RHCP albums ever recorded (they are my favorites).  There is no doubt that the chemistry with John is unbeatable, and he is the true RHCP guitarist.  That being said, we can look back on Dave Navarro's stint as a Chili Pepper as kind of a friend helping out the band, similar to what Flea did with Jane's Addiction on the relapse tour after Eric Avery quit the band.  Now if Dave would have became a permanent pepper, that might have proved a problem, but what he does is step in and help his friends out on an album, and I think he does great work on this album.  It is difficult for a guitarist to join another band that had such tight knit chemistry and try to take the part of an integral member like frusciante.  It also didn't help that the peppers just released the best album of their careers (to date, and still their best to some people) so expectations were high for the Peppers.  This album gets ripped on, and I think it's undeserved.  Sure it's not the best Peppers album, but it's not bad at all, and there are several cuts on here that I enjoy such as &quot;Aeroplane.&quot;  As a huge fan of both the Peppers and Jane's Addiction, I love both Frusciante and Navarro.  Just as Frusciante is critical to the Peppers, Navarro is critical to Jane's Addiction.  And now that they are both settled in with their respective bands, we can look at this as a solid effort with the Pepper's good buddy Dave doing his best to help the band out on an album.  This is an album Navarro is proud of, and he should be.
B00000JLWW|5.0|this is a bad movie the part where the monster eats the space ship and the guy dies is good and so is the end but the acting (especially from the lead role, Joe shishkabob) is good okay so the acting is not good actually terrible okay good so awful i like the part where the guy gets all the stuff in his head like his liver and fingers are sucked into space this is good and i like crop dusters five headed turd monkey poop heheheheheheheheheheheheheh i said a bad naughty word don't tell my mommy i live with btw i'm 6 hahaha i'm not uzing that stupid kids review stuff haha stupid amizon BY THE WAY YOU CAN BUY THIS ON MATCH.COM FOR 2 POUNDS DON'T BY IT HERE THIS WEB SITE IS GOOYHHOHOHOHOHOHOHOH! qwurd
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This movie was often showcased in \\"My Recommendations\\" on Amazon. I just overlooked it, and continued on my way through the site - though I did enjoy hearing the title track and cover of Tears For Fears' \\"Mad World\\" by Gary Jules. Last weekend, I came across the DVD in the under $10 bin at a local store, and figured it was worth a shot. The box said little about the plot, and I figured I needed to keep my opinion here relatively the same.<br />   Initially seeing Drew Barrymore (and her company, Flower Films) as one of the executive producers, I expected some pop, bubble gum, teen flick along the lines of her bookend Charlie's Angels with a Final Destination undertone. To my surprise this Richard Kelly script delivered a stark and sterile vision of life though often over-medicated American eyes. It places the 6'-tall rabbit of \\"Harvey (1950)\\" into the setting of darker \\"Magnolia (1999)\\" and its self help videos, with a dash of Alan Ball (American Beauty/Six Feet Under) into a blender, but comes out original and enjoyable. Don't wait two years (like I did) to see it, and don't read all the plot spoilers leaked everywhere else - just watch and discover it for yourself. It will be good to see if Richard Kelly can continue this creative and smart style of filmmaking.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox never gave this show a change. They didn't run the episodes in order, gave it a Friday night time slot and at times episodes were shown weeks apart. They completely dropped the ball on managing this show. Best Sci-fi show ever and sorry to say best show ever cancelled.  <br />Firefly highlights the best character interactions I've seen in any show. They are interesting, smart and funny. What else could you ask for? The writing is also top notch. Great stories are also part of this excellent program. It really leaves you wanting more.  If you enjoy quality programming, you should buy this.
B0000UJL96|3.0|I agree with most of the reviews that this film was better than V, but to say it is the best STAR TREK film made may be a bit of a stretch.  I will offer two criticisms, a minor and what I consider a major one, then I will pillor this film no further.  First, a good deal of the mystery in the plot seems dependent on these gravity boots.  Spock says they could not simply be flushed out the airlock for all to see.  Okay, maybe.  I'll accept that.  But then someone points out they could have been disintegrated by a phaser, at which point the Vulcan character picks up a phaser and fires it to demonstrate that no unauthorized phasers may be fired on board a starship.  Unauthorized phaser?  Huh?  Since when?  You have to get permission to fire a phaser?  An alarm goes off if you do?  This is a ridiculous idea when you think about it, and points to a symptom of the larger disease of this film, which you can't really see unless you start looking, and then once you do the plot cracks apart like a house of cards.  Simply put, it is contrived.  The entire who-done-it plot does not hold up when examined in the cold light of day.  Sure, there is a lot to like about the film, but things like this phaser business make it hard for me to watch.  Not to mention this \\"new\\" Vulcan character that was obviously written for Savvik.  How great this would have been if it had been the Savvik character that betrayed Spock.  But I simply didn't have any emotional investment in this new character, although the writing, and Spock's reaction to her betrayal, clearly seem to suggest that this should have been Savvik.  The assassination attempt at the end is silly, at least the way it is edited.  I don't mean to bash the film--it is a decent movie, but I have never understood why fans love it so much and call it great when it has serious credibility and structural problems and can hardly be compared with ST II.
0451196716|4.0|This book is about a 16 year old boy named Garrtey, who signed up for this walk.  The walk is around 180 miles.  Garretty and 99 other people were sitting in the grass when the Lieutenant came to give them their numbers.  Garrety was number 47.  the walk was very difficult, and so were the rules. You couldn't stop, if you get 3 warnings you were shot.  If the person needs more water, the solider would go and give them a new canteen.  The winner (or the first person to cross) wins a $10,000 cash prize plus a wish of whatever he or she wants.<BR> I think that the book had some strengths because it was pretty good and that it was written pretty good and it described the people really good.  When he wrote it, it made you feel like you were actually in the book.<BR> If I were to compare this book to another one, I don't know what I would compare it with, because I haven't read any books about a people walking to and risking their lives trying to get a prize.<BR> I would recommend this book to people who like a little action, and suspense because you don't know what's coming up next. This book has some suspense because you don't know who's going to get shot next, and if who's going to make it.

B0000DYJM6|4.0|Many times when a band releases a collection of B-Sides, only die hard fans of that artist/band can enjoy it. This is not the case in Pearl Jam's &quot;Lost Dogs.&quot; Even people not familiar with Pearl Jam can listen to and enjoy this double album. Most of the songs are from the earlier years of Pearl Jam; however, there are a few from the Yield, Binarual, and Riot Act sessions. Songs that make this album memorable include Footsteps, Down, and Fatal. Another gem is a secret song on the 2nd disc entitled &quot;4-20-02.&quot; This is a song that (vocalist/guitarist) Eddie Vedder wrote about deceased Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley. <BR>Lost Dogs is a great collection of songs, overall. Its hard to believe that some of these are B-Sides; most of them are good enough to go on any of Pearl Jam's albums. Lost Dogs is great for long time Pearl Jam fans, and is even a good intro to music fans just getting into Pearl Jam.
B00005JM02|5.0|Wonderful underwater tale, fun for kids and adults.  Ellen DeGeneris steals the show and offers levity to what could have been a seriously sad animated movie.  Albert Brooks is the perfect overly protective father.  I was hooked from the start.<BR>Michael Duranko [...]   presant? Watch to find out.g team you are! Of course I woul d have loved to have seen the actors in action doing their voice overs but this would have to be the ONLY set-back. We only see about 3 people in the bonus bits. To all the 15 million owners of this DVD already we don't need to encourage the 'rest' of the western population to buy it... the sales figures says it all. <br />**** out of ****** from me... his fears of open water to swim through the whole coast of Australia to find Nemo, aided by Dory the nutty blue tang who tracked the path of the dentist's boat.<br />The movie is not as funny as most of the other Pixars, though it has its moments: the Fisheaters Anonymous meetings for sharks, some of Ellen DeGeneres' scene-stealers as Dory the forgetful blue tang, the goofy fish Nemo meets in the dentist's tank who provide color commentary for dental procedures.<BR>The movie is also more poignant than the other Pixars. And you're guaranteed never to look at fish in fishtanks the same way again.<br />As a DVD, the extras are not very good.  There are &quot;deleted scenes&quot; but they were deleted at the storyboarding stage of production, so they did not get the full Pixar compu-graphic workup and are instead crude drawings with proto-type voiceovers [Pixar does an initial voice-over of the script with in-house production crew members providing the voices, then brings in the high-priced talent like DeGeneres, Albert Brooks [Marlin], Geoffrey Rush, Willem Dafoe, etc.; sometimes Pixar folks' work remains in the movie such as Crush the surfer-dude turtle in this flik, and Heimlich the fat caterpillar from A Bug's Life].  There are also some educational bits that are interesting.<br />But the character interviews with Dory, Marlin and Nemo are not particularly humorous or well-written, they just magnify the characters' more noted traits. Worst of all, there is NO BLOOPER SET -- the best feature of the other Pixar films (they're so popular that Monsters, Inc. had TWO Blooper sets).  That is a true loss.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|This album is rubbish if you are looking for real music. There is no emotion, no tune, nothing. Just a lot of hype and drama. Listen to the songs, they build up like movies. There's more talking than singing. Britney Spears doesn't even sing properly.<BR>She lowers her voice. Why do small children go gaga over her? She's not a good role model for the youth. Look at how she keeps breaking up her marriages.<br />Leaving aside her image, if you want to hear her best dance songs, stick to five major songs - 'Oops...! I did it again', 'Baby One More Time', 'You drive me crazy', 'Autumn Goodbye', and 'Overprotected'. If you want softer songs, listen to 'Sometimes', and 'Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman'. I find Lucky and Stronger very annoying now, though I used to like them before. Buy these single tracks online instead of buying the whole albums/cds (Baby One More Time, Oops..! I did it again, and Britney). <br />The point is - Spears produced some really good songs before, which could be enjoyed, but now this album is stupid. I wasted 650 rupees buying this album. Don't buy it!
B00003CXRP|5.0|This wonderfully entertaining film features an acting performance unparalleled in the annals of cinema.  With a bare minimum of dialog, he conveys almost superhuman agony and despair, and yet from the uncharted depths of his soul summons the will to survive. With every twist of fate we suffer along with him in his pain, and take joy in his hope.  Yes, without doubt, it is Wilson who carries this film, yet inexplicably he was totally overlooked at the Oscars and Golden Globes. Clearly, it is Wilson who squeezed an excellent performance out of Mr. Hanks and was the linchpin of the entire zillion dollar production.  Perhaps for future roles he will receive the recognition from his peers that he so richly deserves.
B000089CJI|5.0|This album is wonderfully put together.  It mixes a twist of Aphex Twin's ambiance with Belle and Sebastian's poeticness.  It is the best album I've heard in a long time!

B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I wasn't attracted to the strokes at all when they released their first alblum. And  still wasn't into them when they released their second alblum. Then I was coaxed into seeing them in concert; from that day on I have not blasphemed the name of the Strokes. Guys, if you are riding the fence on your likeing for this band, go see them live. Its like having a come to Jesus meeting. With that said, Room on Fire: good but not great and it stays in my CD player quite a bit.

B000005J56|1.0|I'm sorry but this is not a listenable CD.  This is the standard repetitious Latin music we pass over on the radio every day.  Although the performers are legends within the Cuban music community, to a listener whose ears have been conditioned to the jazz, pop, country and classical of regular old USA offerings, it's not interesting.  It is better when someone like Carlos Santana or Al DiMeola interprets it and filters it.  It is not very good otherwise.  I would prefer listening to a faucet drip, rats in the attic or fingernails on a chaulkboard.  If I could, I would give it zero stars.
B0000931QA|5.0|Operation Mindcrime makes Rush's &quot;2112&quot; look like child's play, the Moody Blues &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; seem like opium-induced melancholy meanderings, and Maidens &quot;Seventh Son&quot; seem a cheesy synth-guitar march toward death. I am a fan of all aforementioned bands (along with many others), but there is simply no comparison to this conceptual album; Superb, rising vocals, grinding guitar, and sardonic lyrics make this a supreme listen!
B00005ONMJ|4.0|It is already evident that this is one of the must have DVD, the Vienna Philharmonic plays with the naturalness they possess with the weightiness and the seriousness of Furtwangler. The best thing about this is that Furtwangler is able to emphasize and bring the story into the climactic points. That is not all that Furtwangler does, he is able to set each scene in an instant whether it is romance, dark, misterious, anger or whatever, and he does it immediately (in orchestral entries especially, or other 'transition points' in scenes). At first it may seem dull, but it won't let you down!<br />One disappointment for me, was in film editing(or manipulating) right at the begining, with the overture where you can see Furtwangler conducting. The overture have slow section for about 2 minutes and follows a fast section for about 3 minutes. The slow part was great, no problem, but in the fast part where you see the Furtwangler from the front (about 4minutes and 21 seconds into the overture for about 6 seconds) they have copied the shot taken from the slow section (about 1 minute 09 seconds into the overture for about 14 seconds), sped the film up, and pasted onto the fast section. The music itself is unaffected and no problem, but Furtwangler was not conducting like that in that 6 seconds(I don't know if VHS of this had the same issue or not). It's only the matter of 6 seconds, and the disappointment level would vary according to people but for me it was an utter disappointment, I don't know if anybody have the nerve to 'copy and paste' like that...<br />Having said that, afterall it is a great buy of great opera being performed well and I would recommend it to anyone who loves opera or great music!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I'm giving it 5 stars and I'm not getting paid for doing that!  Anyway, I have been listening to the original on vinyl for 34 years, but I like this version even better than the original!  It's about time we got to hear The Long and Winding Road more like the way it was meant to sound
B00001U0GQ|5.0|Wow. Let's hear it for Michael Mann! <br />The most beautifully portrayed and directed historical film of 1992, Michael Mann's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; carries an uneraseable memory in 20th Century Fox's motion picture industry. Even the music score theme throughout the film was appropriate and especially breathtaking at the starting opening title.<br />LOTM helps us to take a deeper look into the historical struggles of war-torn families in the latter years of the 17th Century, as well as show the emotion that just seems to gush from the widescreen. Not only does it relay war facts of the past, but it shows how it affected all individuals involved.<br />Based on the novel by James Fenimore Cooper, the main star Daniel Day-Lewis plays the adopted son Hawkeye, who was raised by the last of a vanishing people. And the lovely  and gorgeous Madeleine Stowe plays as Cora, one of the British general's two daughters, who would later meet Hawkeye and fall in love. <br />Being trained in combat as an Indian, Hawkeye helps his &quot;father and brother&quot; fight off the many war parties/battles (indians who at the time were allies to the French) that swept New England against the British. <br />The film LOTM overflows with violent war action, suspense, romance, and obviously the struggle for survival beginning in the year 1757. It was a time when you were on one side or the other, but never neutral ground. If you refused to accept being drafted, you were labeled a coward and you deserved to die. Fight or die was the heartbeat of the age, and you fell under one category or the other.<br />But as mentioned above, this timeless epic was not just about war, but about life, love, and freedom. It shows us what our ancestors and forefathers fought for that we might enjoy our nation's independence. <br />*This motion picture was rated R for graphic war violence. Please note this restriction to children under the age of 17, who should be attended by an adult parent or other guardian. Available on VHS and DVD in widescreen format.<BR>Take it home today.
0804106304|5.0|This is the story of Chinese mother and their daughters. All the mothers originally immigrated from China, and all have faced hardships and challenges, which have made them stronger and wish for something better for their American daughters while instilling in them Chinese values, but their daughters aren't living it up. They're facing their own problems as well, divorce, failure, shortcomings.<br />This was a beautiful story about the complications between mother and daughters. While there are strong Chinese themes, any woman can look beyond this and maybe see their own relationship with their mother. There's so much unspoken between the mothers and daughters in this book. There are so many things they wish to tell each other, to make the other understand. There's a hazy gray area between them that they're trying to overcome.<br />I really enjoyed this book. As I mentioned, it was beautiful. It showed the triumphs and failures of mother and daughter. It touched on the complexity of mother-daughter relationships, how what a mother wants for a daughter may not be the same thing the daughter wants for herself. In fact, there are many complex mother-daughter issues. And the story ends on a note that lets you decide if things got better or worse for the mother and daughters.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I picked up this album a few days after it was released on advice from a friend who has been listening to an advance copy of the album for quite some time now. He described them as the \\"Eagles of the garage rock phenomenon,\\" and I was really excited to check them out. After listening through this album for a few weeks now I can see where he would come up with that asessment based on two tracks (\\"Come Around Again\\", and \\"Move On\\") due to their softer sound and country-tinged acoustics, but the rest of the songs sound nothing like The Eagles. <br />Overall this album doesn't seem to sample influences from any specific act, but rather from just about everybody. It is that fact that will probably bring the most criticism against them as they are put down for trying to sound like everyone else. However, in my opinion that's what makes this band so much fun. They sound like all the older bands that I love with a bit of a modern edge, and its just a great time to listen to. Yeah it's not innovative, but at this point in music...what is? <br />\\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\", \\"Rollover DJ\\", and \\"Get What You Need\\" sound the most like the other retro-sounding acts such as The Vines and Strokes out of everything offered here. Personally I love all three of these tracks (particularly the first two) and enjoy them just as much if not more than many of the songs written by any of their peers. <br />Naturally there is an attempt at a Beatles-esque track here in the form of \\"Look What You've Done\\", which isn't anything amazing, but is pretty good none-the-less. <br />What makes this group a bit different than the rest of the retro-copy groups out there right now is a different sound that is hard to describe. It's sort of like a country AC/DC if you can work that out in your head. Tracks like \\"Get Me Out Of Here\\" and especially \\"Cold Hard B****\\" make perfect examples of this and really add a bit of variety to the sound that Jet can offer. <br />Overall I really enjoy this release. Sureit sounds like a bunch of other groups, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. The guy's voice is perfect for this and sounds tremendous the entire time. It's been pointed out in other reviews before and I can't help but make a nod here; that he has the best \\"yeahhh\\"s and \\"Alriight\\"s in the music industry today. While sure, this isn't a big deal, it just helps add to the good time that Jet serves up track after track. <br />Truly a great album to just throw in and to just enjoy without overanalyzing or thinking about too much. I definitely suggest picking up a copy if you can handle listening to and enjoying music without trying to prove your \\"vast musical prowess\\" by putting a group down for displaying their influences. With a lot of the stuff being released today, I personally think it's great to hear some sounds of the past popping up again. What do you have to complain about?
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I really don't know why everyone is trashing this album so badly. Yes, I am a Dreamophile, and if this album is 'different' than other albums, so what. Does anyone honestly think they can't write material like SFAM or 6DOIT? Or are you just disapointed that they didn't stick to that formula? AC/DC certainly isn't progressive, people! That being said and out of the way, this album is powerful! Some of their heaviest, and I applaud it. A full 5 stars from me. Just get over yourselves, realize that you will never be this talented, and listen to the album again.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I tink this album is great.I am 20 years old so this movie came out bfore my time but i grew up watching the movie my aunts and uncles would watch it and for my 16 birthday my dad bought me the album.I know every word of every song. I definatley recomend it!!!
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|The Strokes epitomize the East Coast hype machine gone berserk. Their handlers, record company execs, the NY media, and everyone else that is desperate to see any hip dudes from the Big Apple succeed on a national scale have all done their job in trying to convince us that these guys are the modern Beatles (or at least the modern Television). Meanwhile, people who know and love rock music aren't any more fooled by it than we are by Nickelback and Creed. Is This It left me thinking just that. I thought maybe The Strokes had more in the tank and the second album would show the world what the fuss was all about. So I anxiously but cautiously approached this album only to realize for sure that the tank is empty. The Strokes come across like a like a one-trick pony. This album doesn't suck but it's not that great either. Buy the White Stripes back catalog instead.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Okay, Whitney has had her share of bad press over the past couple of years. What has this got to do with her music? After listening to this holiday album, you'll know the answer to that is nothing. Does she carry the same flavor or style of singing since her debut album in 1985? For the most part, yes. The only thing that's changed about her singing is that she has developed her own style. When you listen to her latest album, you realize she has matured and more importantly, has the ability to make any song uniquely her own. Her vocals are still as smooth as silk and range as high as Everest. Admittedly, she can at times get a little carried away with the melisatics. But compared to Christina Aguilera, Whitney is a traditionalist. I applaud her continued efforts and showing the critics she is here to stay for years to come. Compared to many of the fly by night performers out there, Houston has been well established now for 19 years. Music styles may change but this is one vocalist whose legacy will continue for generations like Aretha Franklin, Nancy Wilson &amp; Ella Fitzgerald. You need to add her Christmas album to your collection!
0312263120|1.0|As a fan of DVC and Dan Brown's other works, I was hopeful that this would be a hidden gem.  Boy was I disappointed.  Had I read this five years ago, I might have been more impressed -- I wouldn't have known the depth of plot devices' ignorance and silliness.  I cannot recommend this read.  Stick with Angels &amp; Devils and DVC.  <br />Deception Point isn't bad.  Better than this one.
B000055Y0X|5.0|It's difficult to add much to the endless parade of rave reviews, except to point out that you'll probably never, ever see another film this TIGHT - it fits together like Johansen blocks. Some have said it drags or slows down at times; they must have switched channels or something. It's the shortest 93 minutes you'll ever spend watching a movie. Just superb.
B000083LQB|5.0|My favorite song from Daydream Nation was Rain King. The guitar howled proudly, and the songs sounded as if it were destroying something. Dirty expanded my favorite song. Dirty sounds apocolyptic to me (especially the beginning) or at least we can all agree, very wrong. This CD is evil, scary, you'll want to retract in fear. At times I think this is the album that modern Hardcore wants to be like, but they scream instead.<br />It sounds incredible thanks to Butch Vig at the helm. My description of this with a hardcore edge is a little off, since there's so much variety, though there's still a very heavy and DEFINITELY very thick sound. <br />My favorite? Wish Fulfillment could make me cry if I had a situation to fit it. <br />The B-Sides are top notch, though the second CD is only alright. It's more like a decent post-punk album than a Sonic Youth CD. Maybe I'll give it some more listens and get back to you
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh was already good when he recorded his debut album. Now, with a concert tour and several TV specials behind him, he sings with more assurance.  The tentative quality of his earlier songs is gone, replaced with greater confidence in both the quality of his material and his ability to deliver it.<br />I love the fact that he sings in Italian and Spanish as well as English; in &quot;Closer,&quot; he expands his range to include French, and he does it well.<br />I never thought I'd say such a thing, as I am a dyed-in-the-wool Bocelli fan, but I actually prefer Josh's version of &quot;Caruso&quot; to Bocelli's.<br />I never tire of listening to this talented youngster.  His voice is a delight.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is the type of movie that has everything. The artwork is magnificent and the story is very creative. My friend (who likes anime and I DO NOT) convinced me to watch this. I don't know how but I got through like3 hours of anime while I usually hate it.<br />People who say they don't like this aren't into culture and would probably thrive better with spider-man and other typical american-violence oriented stuff with weak stories. Either you like it or hate it, and if you hate it you should still know why this is great.<br />Then I look at our american highest grossing movie like finding nemo about a kidnapped fish. Spirited Away is what a real good movie is.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|This DVD is absolutely electrifying. I love it. The songs on it are some of their best, Brian's voice is actually very good, pleasant to listen to, not nearly as shot as the Stiff Upper Lip DVD. The gig starts out with one of everyone's favorites, \\"Thunderstruck\\", and ends with one of their most powerful rock messages, \\"For Those about to Rock, We Salute You\\". Angus still has long hair that goes all over his face when he headbangs! It is truly amazing how much energy Angus has, hes a fairly old guy, but hes never too tired or too sweaty to do his fast-paced \\"duckwalk\\". Well, what do you expect from the greatest rock band of all time? These guys rule, they dont get into trends or fashions, they dont care what kind of music is popular, they do their own thing, and dont give a damn what anyone else thinks. One of the highlights of the DVD for me is \\"Jailbreak\\" where Angus goes through around 10 miniutes, if not more, of guitar solos, running, and headbanging. The only setback for me, and this is just a personal opinion, is that Chris Slade is the drummer for this concert. I prefer Phil Rudd's classic drum beat, and he's a lot cooler than Chris, no offense Slade. No other band rocks harder onstage than AC/DC, and thats a fact. You will want to watch this concert over and over again, this really is a good one, and its longer than the Stiff Upper Lip concert. There is also a commentary from Angus and Malcolm version of the concert, where you watch the concert while listening to Angus and Mal explain it all to you, which is a pretty cool feature. I cant seem to notice any \\"voice\\" on the DVD version that a previous reviewer talked about. The only voice i hear is Brian's, if you can tell what clock time this \\"voice\\" comes up then itd be cool. Not much more to say, great concert, great buy, great band. Keep on rockin.

B00005JKCH|4.0|Well, I saw Spiderman on opening day and I thought it was good.  Not great, but good.  See when it comes to superheroes, I'm very critical of Spiderman.  I grew up reading Spidey comics thru most of my youth and really have a connection with him.  He's unlike all these other famous superheroes.  Spidey was tempted by material gain and suffered because of it.  But lets talk about the film.  Tobey Maguire played Peter Parker great.  I really thought his performance was very strong.  But the funny thing is, when he changed into Spiderman, something was lacking, and I'm not talking about the costume.  See, Tobey has this sort of wimper in his voice that's great for Peter Parker, but you still can hear it at times when he's Spidey, and that doesn't sit well with me.  Spiderman is a superhero with a sense of humor.  While he's fighting bad guys he uses lots of funny one liners, and I'm not talking campy now.  It's just his way of lightening up the tension of the fact that he could be injured or killed.  At least that's the way I perceived it.  I loved it in fact.  Spiderman is not really cocky, persay, but he's of course not a cream puff either.  I didn't care much for Kirsten Dunst's performance as MJ, but I guess to the average person she was ok.  I just thought see missed out on a lot of who Mary Jane Watson was.  Yeah they included the problems she had growing up with her family, which is true in the comic book, but something was missing in her performance.  Let's talk about the asthetics.  You know, when doing a film about a comic book superhero, things are gonna be condensed.  Hence, many things that took place hundreds of comic book issues apart from one another are used in the film on the same day or practically the same week.  The origin of Spidey was done well.  In fact it was one of my favorite parts of the movie.  I'm still a little unsure about the decision of having his web fluid come from his own body instead of him creating webshooters and web cartridges himself like he did in thecomic book.  Maybe it seemed too farfetched a concept?  I'll give 'em that.  But they do change certain reasons for doing things.  In the film, Peter, now with his newfound powers, wants to impress Mary Jane (MJ) by getting a car.  He sees an add in a newspaper saying &quot;$3000 to wrestle&quot;.  So he goes to take on this mammoth wrestler and beats him, but only receives $100 because he beat him in the first round and the underhandedness is he had to last 3 rounds to earn the $3000.  Well, in the comic book Peter decides to try the wrestling gig to make some money and become famous.  In the comic he receives the full amount of prize money.  They changed it to incorporate this whole love thing between him and MJ, who did not live right next door to him growing up.  Actually she wasn't the girl Peter was interested in during the timeframe that most of the film takes place in.  I guess that's what really annoyed me...the disclusion of Peter's first real girlfriend, Gwen Stacy.  The part in the film that they did get right is that Mary Jane did date Harry Osbourne, but that was while Peter was with Gwen.  To be honest I enjoyed Gwen Stacy a bit more, but I guess I was in the minority in that opinion since she was killed off in the comic book by the Green Goblin, no less.  They changed this in the film of course.  In the comic book, the Green Goblin kidnapps Gwen and taunts Spiderman, holding him at bay, until finally deciding to drop her to her death.  Spidey does get to her before she hits the ground, but the shock of the fall was what killed her.  This was taken from one key comic book (Amazing Spiderman #121) followed by the next issue (#122) where the Green Goblin is killed, by his own doing.  And they did get this right in the film, so that was good.  Some things were dead on, like Norman (Green Goblin) Osbourne discovering Spiderman's secret identity and then making the people Peter loves suffer (he traumatized Aunt May, who did end upin the hospital in the comic book).  I guess I'm such a purist that all these things bothered me more than it would a person who doesn't necassarily read the comic books.  Like I said, it was a good film, but not great.  I'm sure there were a lot of factors involved on why Gwen Stacy wasn't used.  Perhaps three deaths in the film would've been too much (Uncle Ben, Gwen, and the Green Goblin).  I don't know.  But I guess this is the perfect example of what you get when you condense a comic book into movie form.  Oh yeah, and Willem Defoe was quite good as Norman Osbourne.  The costumes were nice, though in the comic book the green goblin's mask was more attatched to his face and not some big helmet that he wore.  Spidey's costume was very impressive.  I also enjoyed the cameos by Bruce (Evil Dead) Campbell as the wrestling announcer and Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as one of the workers at the Daily Bugle.  I'd still recommend seeing it and buying the DVD which has a lot of nice bonus features.  The nice treat for me was towards the very end of the credits the actual Spiderman theme song from the 60's animated series was played.  It sure beat the crappy rap song that preceded it.  So go see the film and have a good time.  It's not perfect, as comic book fans like myself will atest...but it's a lot of fun!  <br />&quot;Spiderman&quot;-bring on the sequels! <br />&quot;You do too much...you're not Superman you know&quot;. - Aunt May
B00008DDSC|1.0|The last time mainstream Hollywood tried to make a movie with material similar to this the results were equally ludicrous and disappointing -- and I am referring to \\"Exit To Eden\\", a brilliantly sexy book by Anne Rice (writing under one of her other names). I suppose Showgirls also fits the bill. They say that no one in Hollywood starts out to make a bad movie, and while I certainly believe that, The Secretary is one. While the acting is decent and the photograpy well done, the sexuality in the short story (from which this movie takes it's title) is so much better. Given the shortage, in my opinion, of mainstream movie with real sex scenes it must be difficult to do -- and this movie proves that. I can't really recommend this movie to anyone, unless you rent it with Showgirls and Exit To Eden for a night of camp laughs.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This album is what one should expect 6 years after &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;.  Fortunately (or maybe unfortunately?), it shows only remote echoes of its predecessor, while sometimes it sounds more like &quot;Missing..., presumed having a good time&quot;.  The music is great and perfect, but never as popular as the big hits. Although it is a must for funs of Mark Knopfler, it might be boring for the common music listener.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is the best collection ever made on the movie industry i think, everything its marvelous; the characters the play the story, everything, anyone who thinks that knows about movies should see this one at least, or have it.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|...why is it I get the impression that it seems some people are getting paid to write five-star reviews???
B00006L7XQ|5.0|The instrumentation and guest vocals work exceptionally well with Cash's voice. They mirror the terrain of a hard-lived life. One that leaves Cash feeling tired, but wise and ultimately fulfilled. This album captures the joy and pain of letting go. It is so fitting that this beautiful album ended up being Cash's last. He left with something so fine!
B00005OWEG|3.0|I saw Apocalypse Now when it came out, when I was 18, and found it wild and interesting. The new redux version is a bit better, and most importantly has a better ending, which ties the movie together and gives it more meaning.<br />The movie is intentionally strange, but it takes you on a very cold trip. You can't really sympathize with anyone, nor with their situation. Even the horror scenes, in which Vietnamese are abused, seem cartoony -- horrible in theory, but very cold to watch.<br />Hollywood has borrowed so much from this film, that it seems innovative in places and cliche in others. And, unfortunately, it doesn't have the real texture of a movie like Altman's MASH. A texture which would have made it less dated -- it doesn't seem to have a very good sense of its own time. The battle scenes don't look very real -- they could have been just as dramatically effective in a quiet room with a black backdrop. Actually, overall, it seems too much like a play -- too staged, too well-edited and too well-shot to be a hallucination.<br />It's hard for me to say &quot;it's bad&quot;. But it's hard for me to say &quot;it's good&quot;. Watch it and see for yourself.
0385504209|1.0|I don't want to be totally negative about this... Dan Brown is undoubtedly a skilled writer and has managed with The Da Vinci Code to write a book that keeps you going from start to finish, it is a genuine page turner which always leaves you wanting more. But I think of all the books I have ever read this is without a doubt the most patronisingly written, the most simple-minded. If you want a mindless thriller (but one whose thrills are fairly limited) then this is the book for you.... if on the other hand you want one that doesn't insult your intelligence (for example an expert in code cracking who cannot crack the most obvious of codes, an art historian who walks into a room and thinks &quot;Salvador Dali the famous surrealist painter&quot; - I mean, please, are we supposed to believe these people might exist and are respcted in their chosen fields?!!??) then this is definitely NOT the book for you. You might say its only a holiday read, only a thriller, but most thriller writers that I have come across do not attempt to map out every single point to the reader, do not end up making the reader feel insulted by the simple-mindedness of their style. Don't waste your precious time on this, its not worth it. The only reason I would recommend it is to give you a few hours amusement at how laughable the whole thing is.
B00005ARDC|5.0|Ever listen to an album that you had to turn off because it was altering everything you've ever believed so quickly that you couldn't handle it?  Yeah...that good.
0316776963|2.0|This is the first book I've read from David Sedaris.  Sedaris tells some interesting stories, but be warned that they are all a little weird for a small town girl.  His family seems to enjoy making each other crazy and/or grossing each other out far too much.  Some of his essays are enjoyable reads, but the chapter on his brother was made up entirely up the 'f' word in all it's gloified variations.  This is good writing?  And, by the way, while some of Me Talk Pretty is good, none of it is laugh-out-loud funny as the jacket describes.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I have been led to believe that this album was created for driving to. And an escape of a drive though the desert with this album makes perfection. This man seems to have the ability to express a feeling of meloncholy that utterly blows my mind. Makes me realize us humans are not nearly as seperated as we lead ourselves to believe. Though the album was inspired by the loss of a love there is far more depth here then in the typical album of that nature. Its kind of surreal to me because this guy always seems to come out with the perfect album at the perfect time as far as i'm concerned. I was hoping that he would finally express somthing in a less sarcastic and a more tragic and beautiful way this time and that he exactly did. I went from appreciating it in an extremly meloncholy exalting way to hearing it in an utterly cryptic and mystifying sense. And while it does have a tragic quality it remains overall one of the most optimistic albums i've yet to hear. And i know if i am looking for the ultimate album to relax to and escape the insanity of \\"reality\\" for at least a small while this album will be there. Beck is a beautiful creature. And words cannot even begin to sum up the feelings that i have for this album.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Yes, you will recall different bands when you hear SEVERAL Jet songs, but who cares?  It's just fun (if fluffy) rock music that will remind you to dust off some older CDs.  Don't expect to be dazzled by the lyrics, but the beats are infectious.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|Yes, there is no doubt that this movie will appeal to a certain demographic, so if you are a twentysomething male I can assure you this is likely not the flic for you.  If however you can appreciate a movie that is a pure romantic comedy with \\"mature\\" characters complete with wrinkles and sags intact, then this is the movie for you.  Yes, some of the dialogue is less than realistic, but tell me, how many romantic comedies have dialogue that any of us have ever spoken in real life?  So what, it's funny and romantic and has Jack doing some of his best comedic work.  There are those that say they don't want to see a 60 year old actor doing love scenes with a woman half his age (but isn't this an actor who has dated virtually nothing but younger women his whole life?)  Who better to play the part than a man who until recently was dating Lara Flynn Boyle?  Diane Keaton plays to type, but she is sweet and lovely, and I for one appreciated  seeing a mature actress in a lead romantic role who has not been nipped and tucked within an inch of her life.  Diane looked glorious wrinkles and all, what a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood imagery of women.  And yes, Keanu was wooden as always, but I think that was the whole idea. His role was to be the token eye candy, and while his skills as a thespian may be lacking, he is not hard on the eyes.  4.5 stars
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is talented beyond his years.  He writes songs us 20-something people can relate to without wallowing in self pity. How Refreshing! I think it's great.<br />I particularly enjoy &quot;Why Georgia&quot; because the homesickness and the fear of failure is something I myself have experienced.  I bought the CD for &quot;Georgia&quot;, but I found that I enjoy &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot;, &quot;No such thing&quot; and &quot;Not Myself&quot; just as much, and all the rest are great as well!  I fell in love with the song &quot;Neon&quot; because the guitar part is really interesting, and it's so mellow and jazzy!<br />Get this CD, but don't forget &quot;Heavier Things&quot;!
B0000D96NW|5.0|This is a must have along with Master of Puppets, Rust in Peace and Reign in Blood.  Just get it
B0000028VT|5.0|I first bought this album when I was a 7th grader and I wrote about it in my diary :) I said &quot;This is a great CD, someday I'm going to sing just like her!  My favorite songs are &quot;Hero&quot; cause it's so true, and &quot;I've been thinking About you&quot; cause it reminds me of Devin :) he's such a cutie!&quot;<br />Now things have changed since '93. I've never been able to sing quite that well, Devin moved away, and I lost this Album, but one thing remains the same.  This CD is a great collection of Mariah's talents and I think it is her best.  I love all the songs on it, and it shows off her voice in all it's glory.<br />She does best on Music Box, and Just to Hold you Once Again, because I think her voice is best heard soft and slow.<br />This CD is a must have!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I first heard Follow Through from a friend, and after downloading Chariot, I decided that I needed this album in my collection. Best decision I ever made, because it easily outshines everything else in there. A brilliant lyracist, piano player, and most importantly, vocalist, there isn't a single song on this album that hasn't been my favourite at one point. In fact, the only times this album has left my CD player are for about two days at a time when I purchase a new CD and listen to it a few times.<BR>Follow Through: I bought the CD partially on the strength of this song, and while it is an excellent song, saying that it is actually one of the weaker songs on the CD should show you just how great it is. 8/10.<BR>Chariot: Absolutely brilliant. 10/10<BR>Just Friends: It took some time for this song to grow on me, but it's actually an impressive tour-de-force, showcasing all three aspects that make this CD so great. 9/10<BR>(Nice To Meet You) Anyways: I absolutely love this song. It's wholly brilliant, and tied for my favourite song 11/10<BR>Chemical Party: My other favourite song on this CD, this song is absolutely hilarious. I was playing it for my friend while she was driving and she started laughing at one of the lines and almost drove off the road. 11/10<BR>Belief: A beautiful song, this is probably the most touching song on the CD. 10/10<BR>Crush: Another one that took some time to grow on me, but it's an amazing song, like pretty much everything else on here. 9/10<BR>I Don't Want To Be: Another amazing song, proving that he can rock it out. 9/10<BR>Meaning: The hook on this song is absolutely brilliant and had me singing it for weeks. 10/10<BR>More Than Anyone: Another absolutely beautiful song, my only problem with it is that it's the shortest one on the CD. 10/10<BR>Overrated: Probably the weakest song on the CD, but it still outshines pretty much anything in the Top 40 these days. 8/10
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Her voice is like that of Karen Carpenters.  Haunting, beautiful and something I will never get tired of hearing.  Critics have picked apart this album but they must not be listening. <br />&quot;Fallen&quot; is lyrically good and fabulous vocally.  I like &quot;World on Fire&quot; cause it's a little faster and upbeat.  &quot;Stupid&quot; is a song we can all relate to. <br />I wonder if &quot;Drifting&quot; isn't a reflection on her own fame?  &quot;You've been gone for so long all that you know has been shuffled aside as you bask in the glow of the beautiful strangers that whisper your name.  Do they fill up the emptiness?&quot;<br />&quot;Trainwreck&quot; is catchy and does a great job showing off her voice.  &quot;Push&quot; has great guitar and I like the lyrics. &quot;Answer&quot; is by far my favorite song.  Soft, pure, heartfelt. &quot;Time&quot; has great background effects.  &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; is great for the woman in a trouble romance.  Been there, done that.  <br />&quot;Dirty little Secret&quot;  is beautiful lyrically as well a vocally and instrumentally.  One of the best on the album!<br />Get it, don't listen to the critics!
B000002UA0|5.0|The sound of innocence careering off the rails, with the most demented guitar sounds ever heard, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is a schizophrenic masterpiece. The album's genius lies in the way it brings together catchy, nursery-rhyme pop songs (The Gnome, Scarecrow) and insanely dissonant jazz-rock (Interstellar Overdrive), without sounding awkward. The best songs, such as Astronomy Domine and Flaming, actually FUSE the two, bringing together seemingly diametrically opposed musical philosophies without sounding at all forced. Such was the genius of Barrett's Floyd. Whilst I am a great fan of late Floyd, nothing has sounded like this before or since.<BR>One caveat, however: Waters's song, Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk, is very slightly out of place, and the tunesmithery does not compare to that of Barrett. Also, his lyrics are much less psychedelic and, even at this stage, betray a down-to-earth cynicism that is at odds with Barrett's approach. But it's worth listening to for the superb band performance in the mid-section.<BR>I also think it's important to mention that Richard Wright gives his defining performance on this album. Never again would he sound quite so... cool. Perhaps it's Barrett bringing the best out in him - faced with the insane sounds of Syd's guitar he seems to push the boat out, something he did less and less with each successive Floyd release, eventually being content to provide a tasteful backdrop for David Gilmour. Not that I dislike late Floyd, it's intelligently written rock music with superb musicianship, and the songs as a whole are probably a bit better written. But there's something about this album that is absolutely unique. If you don't own it, well... you should.
B000096FUD|3.0|Lost in La Mancha is a highly entertaining documentary on Terry Gilliam's disasterous attempt to adapt Cervantes Don Quixote for the screen. Like Orson Welles before him, Gilliam becomes the latest victim of the Don Quixote curse. Gilliam's 10 year obssession is thwarted after only 6 days of actual shooting. The film, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, collapses under the weight of financial burden, flash floods, jet fighters and a painful prostate condition. Everything that can go wrong does and what Gilliam has to show for his efforts are his wonderful storyboards, a few finished shots and the desire to resurrect the project in the future. The film is narrated by Jeff Bridges, features Gilliam as well as Jean Rochefort and Johnny Depp. It was directed by Keith Fulton & Louis Pepe, the same team responsible for the delightful DVD bonus feature The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys. As far as production documentaries go, while not the nightmarish freakshow that Hearts of Darkness was, Lost in La Mancha is still a compelling portrait of the filmmaking process. As an extra bonus the DVD comes with a second disc of material featuring 2 lengthy interviews with Terry Gilliam. Both are enjoyable, if somewhat redundant, but be warned - one interview is conducted by NY Times film critic Elvis Mitchell in front of a live audience. Mr Mitchell is downright painful to watch as he sqirms, tries to articulate questions & laughs like an nervous and insincere hyena.
0385504209|4.0|Being a man of worldly travel stature and reading the book from an objective point of view(that means non-bias).  I felt that this book was in a whole minus the conclusion worth the 25 dollars I paid for it.  This is with out a doubt one of those books that you cant put down.  Each chapter leaves you wondering, what happens next? or I cannot believe that just happened! However the conclusion I found less then up to par... read but do not expect the finish of a life time.  Priests and historians beware, I have researched both views for almost 3 months and niether side will be completely content with the contents of this book. Catholics because of some of the ideals, and historians because of the elaboration of ideas... overal this book should be read and disscussed though.  It puts a question into light... what would we do if modern day christianity tottally vanished.  In my opinion, CHAOS.  read the book mates.
B000001DTM|5.0|When I first listened to this album I found it hard to get past the first track Zoo Station. I really liked it a lot, but as I listened to the rest of the Album I thought it was just ok and I wasn't that impressed. Then someone told me the song One is a very nice song and to listen to it again, So I listened to the cd again and again and I realised that the cd was absolutely growing on me. I have never listened to a cd like this before, this cd has an unexplainable feeling and mood to it. This album is defintely one of the best albums of our time and I have never listened to another album that completely captivates you and takes you into another world like this album does!
B000089RVR|1.0|Its Jan 6 2004. In my original post in November 2003 - 460 ACTUALLY PRESSED the \\"was not helpful\\" button. Is this a record for a review? Im glad though, meant you read it before pressing that button. Or did you, as open minds and Dido don't really go together, or do they? Some of the fawning reviews after bear me out completely.<br />Shame on people who mark their \\"fav\\" album by putting each track and marking it 10/10! Did you listen to it first before you decided to tell the world that the wonderful Dido ...was the bestest, beautifulest, yummiest CD ever in the history of CDs. Its not, not many are lets face it!<br />A couple queried why Faithless is mentioned, one even said it wasnt relevent as its completely different music. Well in one way you are right, Faithless are a good band, producing challenging talented music. Everything Dido is not. But, duh, Rollo who is in Faithless is her brother. Also she sings on their albums occasionally and he plays on hers. That, in my book, is a pretty clear connection. In an interview in Q Magazine this week, she has indicated again she want to be on the next Faithless album to sing on a track, and she'll do it for nothing. Lordy, that is one Faithless track ruined them!<br />This, people, is still coffee table music, its your lives. If you are happy with Dido, Celine Dion and Sade drabness then fine. I'd recommend getting the new Tori Amos collection, there lies true greatness in song and lyric...it puts Life For Rent where it should be, second by a mile.
B00009L1TA|5.0|This movie has a lot of awesome twists &amp; turns. (YOU CAN'T LEAVE YOUR SEAT) I watched this movie 5 time so I could understand what was going on in some parts. It is a must see movie but, make sure that if you rent it that you get it for 3 to 5 days otherwise you will still be wandering what happened. taye diggs was also &amp; great addition to the rangers ((((HIGHLY RECOMMEND))))
B00009V7T2|5.0|If you are any kind of At the drive-in fan you should already have this cd.
B0000U0X1G|5.0|I watched this movie in theatre &amp; was astounded at all the awesome traning they show that a swat member goes through. Colin Farrel &amp; Samual L Jackson were awesome pic for a movie like this. I would give you a review on what the movie is about but, that would totally ruin the movie for you. IT IS DEFINENTLY WORTHY OF 1 VEIWING even if your not a fan of swat or the cast!!!
0805209999|5.0|Kafka crafts a sometime eerie, sometime funny, but always fascinating work that details the criminal legal system's prosecution/persecution of a &quot;Josef K.&quot; The book's famous first sentence ominously forebodes the grinding machine that slowly devours Josef: a nameless, invisible bureaucracy that is omnipotent in its reach and accountable to no one. Although many novels written in the 20th century have appropriated similar versions of totalitarianism (1984, Brave New World, etc.), it should be noted that The Trial provided the template and, if you ask me, continues to stand without peer in its brilliant construction of terror caused by absurdity. Indeed, this book is, unsurprisingly, the prototypical example of the 'Kafkaesque:' feelings of guilt and alienation triggered by menacing forces that are bound by their own impenetrable logic. Anyone interested in 20th century literature ought to do himself or herself a favour and read The Trial, since the Kafkaesque informs so many of the themes and approaches to writing adopted by the century's top stylists.
B00005JLXE|4.0|This movie was great. Nothing awesome or brilliant about it. Most movies are using the matrix moves these days so, what can you expect. I ejoyed the bad guys the most meaning: Colin Farrel. He had alot of enthusiasm that brought out the bad guy in the movie. If your a Colin Farrel fan then I highly recommend!!!
B000000OQF|5.0|This amazing debut is easily \\"Guns N' Roses\\" best, and probably one of the best rock/metal albums of all time. It gave rock n' roll a good kick in the [pants] when it needed it, just as albums by \\"Nirvana\\" and \\"The Sex Pistols\\" did. It starts off perfectly with that riff from \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", then goes through other excellent tracks like \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", \\"Paradise City\\", \\"It's So Easy\\", and of course \\"Sweet Child Of Mine\\". My favorite song is actually \\"Rocket Queen\\", but all of them are classic. This is an album, that when it was released, immediately made it near impossible to improve on. The band eventually just dissappeared, but this is still the album to play when you've got an \\"Appetite For Destruction\\".
0425152251|3.0|Jostein Gaarder uses metafiction as a tool to emphasize the predominant questions of philosophy: Who are you? and Where do do you/we come from? Sophie Anundson receives mysterious letters from Alberto Knox ostensibly to teach her lessons in the history of philosophy. Interspersed with her lessons is the mystery of Hilde Moller Knag and her father who maintain a correspondance through the unwitting Sophie. The mystery of Hilde and her father's identity (and for that matter Sophie and Alberto's identity)is revealed at the time when Alberto is beginning his lecture on the Enlightenment (ha, ha). This is one of the annoying problems with the novel: it all reads like a high school philosophy coarse and, like most metafiction, is too involved in style and technique (not to mention the author's self-indulgance) to be bothered with insignificant matters like plot or character development. It is all excessively tedious and only remotely interesting. But the author raises very interesting questions, however simplistic his and obviously slanted his answers may be. For better metafiction read italo Calvino's &quot;If on a Winter's Night a Traveler.&quot; For a better rendition of the history of philosophy read: &quot;A Short History of Philosophy&quot; by Robert C. Solomon and Kathleen M. Higgins. For a better book by Gaarder read &quot;The Solitaire Mystery&quot;
B000002MU3|4.0|It's true, this may not be &quot;Murmur&quot; or &quot;Out Of Time&quot;, but it's still an amazing album. I think they really needed to make this record, just as &quot;U2&quot; had to do &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; at that time. Also, them jumping onto the alt-grunge bandwagon is nonsense. &quot;Monster&quot; was the natural progression after &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;. Plus, this album has it's own share of hits, including the great opener &quot;What's The Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;, &quot;Strange Currencies&quot;, and &quot;Bang And Blame&quot;. I think &quot;Star 69&quot; and &quot;Crush With Eyeliner&quot; were even minor hits. There's only about two tracks I don't consider that good. Overall, &quot;Monster&quot; is essential for my collection, especially since only one track made the recent &quot;Best Of&quot;. Perfect album title too.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|A perfect heist. World-class locations. Super-charged mini-coopers. What more can one expect from a film like &quot;The Italian Job&quot;?  For one thing, this film has everything that a heist film can contain, such as a superb cast, a superb plot, and a superb action sequence.<br />Much like Steven Soderbergh and his film &quot;Ocean's Eleven,&quot; F. Gary Gray (&quot;Friday&quot;) uses his great directoral skills to gather an unforgettable, and even likeable cast of actors that somehow are a match made in heaven with their roles. Mark Wahlberg exhibited his leadership role very well as Charlie Croker, while Charlize Theron, Seth Green (who ultimately stole the show in his hilarious imitation of Jason Statham's character with the cable girl), Jason Statham, and Mos Def all portrayed their roles very well. I also give credit to Edward Norton for his chilling role as the villianous Steve, and to Donald Sutherland for his excellent portrayal as the father of Charlize Theron's character. The cast recieves a score of 10/10.<br />The plot is by far the best that has been written for the screen! Since it was based on the 1969 version of the same name, I believed the writers did an excellent job in adapting the classic film. I also believed that the characters were well developed and introduced smoothly, without the jumping around that most films habitually do to introduce characters. For this, I give the plot a score of 10/10. <br />Lastly, the action sequence with the Mini Coopers was fast-paced and exciting at the same time! I was left on the edge of my seat as I watched every frame of the fast-paced sequence go by, almost rooting on the good guys to suceed. More action sequences like this are needed in every action film that comes out in theaters! The action sequence took my breath away and I give it a score of 10/10.<br />Overall, a superb cast, a superb plot, and a superb action sequence is all that's needed to make trips to the local movie theater a worthwhile experience, especially if you like action-packed films, with a touch of humor and world-class locations!
B000002NHN|4.0|These eight tracks make up an amazing album. Whether you call it new age, celtic, or world music, it's very pleasurable listening. &quot;Mummers' Dance&quot; is the well known song, and if you enjoy that, the whole album is sure to please. Perfect for relaxing or meditation. Another great track among great tracks is &quot;Highwayman&quot;, and &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; is a perfect closer. The use of such worldly instruments as flute and violin, make this album even more special. If you like &quot;Loreena McKennitt&quot;, you may also like &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, or &quot;Dead Can Dance&quot;.
0767817478|5.0|To start off, Godzilla is the type of movie that packs a lot of fast-paced fun and surprises without slowing down. The acting (especially from Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria, and Maria Pitillo), the direction, and the visual effects fit together perfectly in what I consider to be the greatest monster film made (after King Kong)! The DVD transfer is by far the best quality I've seen, along with great DVD features to satisfy any moviegoer's appetite for behind-the-scenes info (especially the \\"On Location\\" featurette). Overall, I recommend viewing Godzilla because with the acting, direction, and visual effects, it's a movie that nevers leaves the viewer unsatisfied and it also lives up to being a \\"popcorn movie.\\"
B000092ZYX|5.0|Every thing about this album, this band, is downright amazing and orignal. I would higly recommend this album and other works by this great band to anyone with good musical tastes. To explain the album in detail I will go through an individual track rating.<br />2 + 2 = 5 : 8/10 Great song, ends totally different then it begins, except for the fact that it begins and ends good.<br />Sit Down, Stand Up : 9/10 One of my favourites, also undergoes a total metamorphasis. The ending is very experimental and different.<br />Sail to the Moon : 7/10 Beautiful song, with piano that makes you feel like you are sailing to the moon.<br />Backdrifts : 8/10 Probably the first song off the album that cought my attention. Very experimental and an overall good song.<br />Go to Sleep: 7/10 The second single off the album, way better than the first. A song with a good beat.<br />Where I End and You Begin : 6/10 Nothing special, but a nice bass line.<br />We Suck Young Blood: 6/10 Not their best.<br />The Gloaming: 8/10 Another great experimental song.<br />There There: 1/10 Possibly the worst Radiohead song ever.<br />I will: 9/10 Short, but catchy and beautiful.<br />A Punchup At A Wedding: 6/10 A good song<br />Myxomatosis: 8/10 Naming a song after...a disease that kills rabbits? A great, poppy and experimental song.<br />Scatterbrain: 7/10 Catchy, but not great.<br />Wolf At The Door: 10/10 Possibly my favourite. Thom's voice sounds strong, with a bit of fear behind it.<br />Try as they might, no band can match Radiohead's sheer musicianship and talent and emotion. Buy it today.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Sometimes you're taking a chance when the only description in the review on the front of a DVD box is the single word, \\"Funny.\\" Is it \\"ha-ha\\" funny or \\"my soda tastes funny, try it\\" funny? Fortunately Galaxy Quest delivers more than great laughs, it has well-done special effects, good writing and characterization, and acting that's well above average. Tim Allen does a good job of distancing himself from the Home Improvement Tool-Man character, while Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman portray their characters with a vulnerability they don't usually show in their more commercial work. Tony Shaloub is excellent as always.<br />Plot-wise, Galaxy Quest is little more than \\"The Three Amigos in Space\\" (of course, Star Trek was pitched as &quot;Wagon Train in Space,&quot; so perhaps the similarity is apropos). It does enough new and differently with the premise, however, to make this a good film in its own right. The inclusion of the Sci-Fi convention fanboys in the climactic scene was hilarious, and at the same time managed to ring true. Cmdr. P.Q. Taggart, having to fight the twin El Guapos of the alien, Sarris, and egomania - well, that's one more El Guapo than The Three Amigos had, isn't it? <br />There are a few bonuses on the DVD, but an actor and/or director commentary would have been nice, too. The Thermian audio track is of the native Thermian squeaking variety, not the mis-inflected English spoken most frequently in the film. Usually deleted scenes are cut for a reason: they're not very good. Several of the extra scenes on the DVD, however, could have been included in the final release without any problem (one clears up a continuity problem involving Sigourney Weaver's uniform zipper). The \\"making-of\\" documentary is nice. The cast/crew bios are good and provide a nice little Easter Egg Hunt, as well.<br />I really enjoyed this movie. More than just funny, it's clever and witty, too. If the DVD packaging is ever redesigned, that's three words they can put on the cover. Check it out.
0385504209|3.0|Everybody's talking about this book.  A friend of mine has invited folks over to discuss it.  I've no doubt this will springboard us into talking about 'the sacred feminine' (Eve was framed) and &quot;Are there intergenerational, nay inter-epochal conspiracies, secret societies, etc, etc, etc.&quot;  Well OK, the book is selling and it's a great springboard.<br />Other questions that I expect answers to in a book ballyhooed as much as this one:  &quot;What if I had the Holy Grail, the actual cup that Jesus drank the first communion with his disciples; what properties would the Grail convey on the possessor (or viewer)?  Would it be like Dorothy's ruby slippers or Midas' golden touch?  Another question- how is the Grail's authenticity verified?  Tell me this, Dan Brown!  No, &lt;The DaVinci Code&gt; never reveals this to my satisfaction.  The whole 'thing' hinges on a riddle and the hero, Langdon never sees the Grail.  So...it's DaVinci Code as in Crossword Puzzle, not as in the chromosonal genetic code that spells Jesus Christ.  Admittedly, a clever read and if &lt;DaVinci Code&gt; serves you like it did me, to generate an invite to brunch, go for it.  Another caveat; this is one of those stories where the hero was tired to begin with and stays up 48 hours.  Don't start reading it after 9:00 PM or sympathy pains may convince you that sleep is all but impossible!
B00006BTCA|4.0|I like the album a lot, and any deviation from today's pop music is a gift.  Interpol has some excellent guitar work, anxious vocals, and a wall of sound that reminds me of alternative music of the 80's.  I do not see the comparisons to Echo, but I can see a little Joy Division and Furs.  The most striking comparison however would be with the 1990 release of Strange Free World by Kitchens of Distinction.
B0000CBHOI|4.0|This is a great seven-DVD series on blues music.  Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest American film makers of the 20th century, has rendered a tremendous service to his fellow man.  Anyone with even a remote interest in that great American musical artform will appreciate this series.  The main reason why I'm only giving it four (instead of five) stars is because I wish that it had devoted more to exploring BLUES HARMONICA.  As a blues harp enthusiast, I was a tad disappointed that it didn't have much on that particular aspect of blues music (save for some old footage of Paul Butterfield and Howlin' Wolf).  Aside from that, I highly recommend this entire series.
6303295533|1.0|the only reason i gave it 1 star was to get peoples attention (becuase i often find myself checking the negative reviews first and your gonna notice a 1 star before  a 5 star...)<br />point being....some people think this movie is pointless and boring...nobody gets the point of the movie...first of all if you dont understand the CD...you cant understand the movie...<br />the cd is the story of a man whos entire life is flashing before him...all hes been taught, all hes went through...the feelings hes had....hes never learned how to get his feelings out...so he converts his confrontations/feelings into bricks...and creates a wall around his inner feelings...its like cooping all that stuff up inside...<br />the movie simply puts that into pictures and i think its one of the best movies created....<br />Not only that but seriously...anyone whos not brain dead knows that PINK FLOYD isnt your basic tell happy stories and stupid crap band...many of their listeners are usually stoned when they hear stuff like &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and of course &quot;The Wall&quot;....
B00005ASOI|1.0|I had been looking forward to seeing Suspiria for quite some time. I'll confess, the numerous reviews and word-of-mouth got to me. Specifically, the reviews posted here at Amazon. But, holy cow, what an incredibly, dramatically, amazingly OVER-RATED film this is! OK, I'll give you the cool Goblins' soundtrack. I'll grant you Argento's deft use of light and color. But that's it... nothing else.<br />Suspiria is not a terrible film per se, but one of the scariest, most \\"beautiful,\\" most memorable horror films ever?! No way. Not even close. As has been noted elsewhere, Argento's \\"plot\\" is hardly there at all, and the acting and voice-over work is merely passable. But those are not really the reasons to watch an Argento film. You are suposed to enjoy or appreciate his ability to shock and scare you. I am easily (and happily) scared by horror flicks: really good ones (The Exorcist and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer); pretty damn good ones (28 Days Later and Blair Witch Project); even marginally OK ones (Hellraiser II comes to mind -- not great, but interesting). Suspiria ain't even in the same ballpark. Not the same league. Not the same sport. Not for one instant was I in suspense regarding who the bad guys were. Not at any point did I approach being scared. And, MAN-O-MAN, do you think you could get to anything even BEGINNING TO LOOK SCARY QUICKER THAN THE NEARLY 90 (yes, 90) MINUTES IT TOOK TO GET TO THE FRIGGIN' \\"SCARY\\" PART?!?!<br />The fact that Suspiria takes sooooooo long to get to the confrontation between the protagonist and the bad guys was in and of itself enough for me to recommend against this film (nearly 90 minutes, folks). So why 1 star? Because not all the acting is abyssmal, because the cinematography and camera work is interesting, and the soundtrack is genuinely cool.<br />But the scares are non-existant (I am honestly amazed that ANY of the reviewers here stated that they were even the tiniest bit frightened), the first (and, essentially, only) act is far too long, and there is a pitiful \\"resolution\\" to the film (bad guys all die, heroine walks away... the end).<br />I am not of the opinion (as has been stupidly and naively stated elsewhere, Lee) that Halloween Part 4567, or Freddy, or Jason, or Scream are \\"great horror films\\" -- I think they genuinely suck -- and I resent the idiotic implication regarding my intelligence. The fact remains that this film is over-rated. Period. It is not great nor is it a classic, though it does have some winning aspects, which I have noted. But films like Blair Witch, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original), and the first Halloween ARE terrific pieces of entertainment, and are far better representatives of the horror genre than this silly, silly film.<br />The thinking-man's horror flick this ain't. It is simply ridiculous to count this film among the greats of the horror genre, European or otherwise... this film simply does not work in nearly any way for me.<br />Did I miss anything?
B000002UJQ|5.0|What can I say about this album that has not already been said in previous reviews? Absolutely nothing, but I think it's my duty to come here and give it the 5 stars that it deserves.<BR>As for the single tracks, here's my opinion:<BR>1. Airbag - 8.5/10<BR>great opener, awesome beat and guitar effects<BR>2. Paranoid Android - 10/10<BR>referred to as the \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" of the 90's, enough said. 6'23\\" of pure magnificence<BR>3. Subterranean Homesick Alien - 8.5/10<BR>great atmosphere, if you close your eyes, you can see spaceships hover all over the place. incredible lyrics.<BR>4. Exit Music - 9/10<BR>wonderful acoustic tune, with a wonderful final explosion. really moving or exciting, depends on your mood.<BR>5. Let Down - 7/10<BR>musically nothing special, still a good song anyway. beautiful bitter lyrics<BR>6. Karma Police - 9/10<BR>any comment is superfluous. simply great, but not the greatest in my opinion<BR>7. Fitter Happier<BR>this is not a song, it's a computer voice speaking, but I'd give it 10/10 for how well it fits among the tracks and in the whole album. best lyrics ever by Thom, in my opinion.<BR>8. Electioneering - 8/10<BR>the only song that really rocks from the beginning to the end, with an infectious riff and an incredible final guitar jam. I trust I can rely on your vote!<BR>9. Climbing up the Walls - 8.5/10<BR>gloomy and eerie track, quite experimental, yet beautiful. features distorted strings<BR>10. No Surprises - 10/10<BR>my favourite song, I love everything about it, the almost childish melody, the lyrics, the video. features Greenwood on xylophone. NB don't listen to it if you're about to commit suicide<BR>11. Lucky - 9/10<BR>Classic slow-rock ballad. very melodic. great intro by Ed, and great solo by Johnny at the end.<BR>12. The Tourist - 6/10<BR>The only track that I could never really get. It's not bad, there's a great performance by Thom here, but it kind of bores me, I don't know why.<br />This album is a masterpiece, anyway if anyone who has listened carefully to it still thinks that this is crap, no problem, write your own review, and give it 1 star, if you like.<BR>But if what bothers you is the constant acclaim that Radiohead are receiving, and come here just to give vent to your frustration for being a Linkin Park, Justin Timberlake or Bitchney Spears fan, well, stop, I don't think it's fair. I'd like to spend my day giving 1 star to every damn album by every damn so-called-artist I hate (and there are many, believe me), but I just don't do it, that's all. I love this album and Radiohead since late 1997, so no hip bandwagon in my case, I swear.
B0000TB050|5.0|U2 proved once again on 1st Sept. 2001 that they ARE the greatest rock band in the world by delivering up their hearts and souls in this mighty concert at Slane Castle.<br />What to say? The show was excellent, and the DVD captures it beautifully. If you've got the DVD of Elevation Live in Boston, you may want to pick this one up also, even though it's basically the same set. It's interesting to see the band put the same playlist through subtle variations, and always interesting to hear Bono wax eloquent (as well as extemporaneously!) during the songs.<br />Songs like &quot;Kite&quot; and &quot;Stuck in a Moment&quot; get an extra dramatic kick due to the fact that Bono's father passed away only the week before this concert was performed. As usual, U2 blow the lid off the world with &quot;Elevation,&quot; &quot;Beautiful Day,&quot; &quot;New Year's Day,&quot; &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky,&quot; and, hell, just about everything else. The Edge once again performs up to his usual standard -- he is sublime -- and Larry and Adam provide their typically strong work on drums and bass guitar, respectively. This is the core of the best rock band since, let's face it, The Beatles.<br />And there's Bono. If there is a more charismatic man on the face of the planet, he is in deep hiding. Bono was made to prowl, prance, preen, stalk and altogether dominate a stage. He was in top form the night of Slane, his voice alternately thrilling and heart-breaking.<br />Complaints? None. This DVD is a must-have for any U2 fan, or for anyone who just enjoys really, really, really great music, played at full volume. But be prepared to cry. Their performance of &quot;One&quot; left this grown man in tears.
B00000899U|5.0|This album is my bible Jeff Buckley is my God we come together to make a chance in the starlight, altough Jeff never finished this album his un finished music leaves you thinking what if he did finish it? does it even get better than this? but then you realise there is no what if and only what is and this album along with grace, Is one of the best albums I had ever heard and a voice like no other, a voice you will never hear more perfect and beautifull then the voice of Jeff Buckley it is indeed a voice to hold in the dark!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This is another technical masterpiece from Dream Theater. They astound me with each release. The only reason I give it just four stars is because I don't think they'll ever top their &quot;Images And Words&quot; CD for sheer brilliance.<br />Even though this CD could easily be described as their heaviest and less melodic release, I find it rather humorous that people are comparing this CD to Metallica. Metallic wishes they could play like this. They are posers compared to Dream Theater.
B00005JLYW|1.0|I found myself saying &quot;oh brother&quot; more times than I think I ever have during a movie. James Bond movies carry unbelievable stunts, but at least those movies keep some sense of reality. This movie doesn't portray any sense of reality to absolute impossible stunts that could never happen. But it wasn't just the over the top stunts that stunk up this film. A combination of sudden magic when the girls would be in one place then all of a sudden somewhere else, then poof, they disappeared to another location. Bad acting and Demi Moore overshadowing the main stars, and forget about any story or plot. There isn't one. And by the way, what the hell was the point of Crispin Glover's role? What a stupid movie...Please don't make another sequel.
0553573403|5.0|I can't really compare it to anything I have ever read. It is unique in writing style and in the level of characterization. Martin is gifted in developing characters that are true-to-life in that there is good and bad, weakness and strength, in all of them as in all of us. He gives his characters multiple dimensions in which they can surprise you with their goodness and shock you with their callousness, or delight you with their humor. You watch them succeed and fail together in what has been masterfully written as a 'dance of life' in epic proportions.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husband and I fell in love with Firefly from the first episode, even tho FOX aired the series out of order. One of the best endorsements I can give Firefly is that it was cancelled by FOX before it had a chance, the same network that cancelled Futurama, Dark Angel, John Q and Harsh Realm after screwing with their time slots and failing to promote them. Firefly is in fine company here.<br />There are no weak links among the characters--simply a marvelous ensemble with witty writing, great humor, adult themes and engrossing stories. I was so absorbed in the dialog the first go round that I missed many of the awesome special effects and rich details.<br />This set is a &quot;must.&quot;
B000002J09|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet, this album is an absolute classic!!! A treat from start to finish!!! Essential Zep!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
1573301183|5.0|MTV's Alice in Chains Unplugged will always stand as a testament to how great this band was, and having viewed it recently for the first time in years, I almost forgot how heart wrenching it was.  From the beginning of the concert, you can plainly see that Layne Staley is high, even as the rest of the band jokes around and plays it off, it still comes off as tragic, but that didn't stop Layne from delivering a booming vocal performance.  This Unplugged session was undoubtadly one of, if not the, best Unplugged's that MTV has ever put together.  The rest of the band, including Jerry Cantrell, Sean Kinney, Mike Inez, and special guest Scott Olsen, is unbelieveably tight knit.  The set list is just about perfect (except there are no songs from &quot;Facelift&quot;) including renditions of &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot;, &quot;Would?&quot;, &quot;Rooster&quot;, &quot;Frogs&quot;, &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, &quot;Nutshell&quot;, and &quot;Brother&quot;, but the best here are the heart wrenching &quot;Sludge Factory&quot;, &quot;Angry Chair&quot; (both of which Layne messes up, even though with &quot;Sludge Factory&quot; it is kind of humerous), and &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; and &quot;Over Now&quot; are enarly impossible not to draw a tear over.  All in all, this is an absolute must have for any and every Alice in Chains fan.  This is music with real emotion and soul; take that Staind.

B00005U2JL|4.0|The Guns, God, and Government World Tour DVD highlights Marilyn Manson's tour around the world by piecing footage together for the 17 song set and also includes a rowdy and downright hilarious half hour documentary.  The live set nicely displays how great the stage shows are at a Manson concert; and the crowds respond with unabashed worship towards Manson and crew.  Standout songs include &quot;Irresponsible Hate Anthem&quot;, &quot;Great Big White World&quot;, &quot;The Nobodies&quot;, &quot;Rock is Dead&quot;, &quot;Cruci-fiction in Space&quot;, &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Lunchbox&quot;.  The aforementioned documentary is a nice bonus, but for the price of this DVD, some other features could have been included, but all together this DVD is better than I thought it would be.

B000089RVX|5.0|People who are true romantics need this CD! Anyone who has ever been in love and lost or won to find out they've actually lost needs this CD.Amy has a voice that rivals Sarah,Dido,and Celine. Every song has a feeling,a message,a unique quality.Anyone who enjoys a song for the vocal ability as well as the arrangement NEEDS this CD.I predict this band is gonna be around for a long time unless the feeling they pump into their body of work manages to pull them apart.Yes, it IS that good. Buy it.

B0000UJL96|5.0|2 4 6, why does the even numbered Treks work (though I still like Trek III, despite being studio bound and featuring a silly bad guy)? Trek has always been about the characters, the interaction of all the actors. And when the writers and directors relied on that -instead of big, empty action pieces and visual eefects -the movie series soared. Looking back over six films, to see why Trek has remained popular after nearly 38 years, is because Trek's II, IV and VI knew this was what the fans wanted. Current Trek (like the last two Next Generation films and Voyager and Enterprise) have chucked most of these ideals out the space dock for digital effects. Undiscovered Country is a well made film, with relaxed performances from the entire cast. Director Nicholas Meyer has said that Shatner gave his best performance in Trek II because he never settled for phoned in performance. Shatner chews the scenery here, but it still good (and besides, Christopher Plumber really steals the whole film by chewing up every scene he's in). While not as good as Trek II or IV, it still is way better than V and the theatercial edition of The Motion Picture (the DVD version is a tad better). A fine send off. I just wished TNG could've substained the franchise, but only First Contact retained the \\"family\\" aspect that made the original series such a blast to watch
B000002U8G|5.0|This great album from Floyd might not be as popular as Dark Side Of The Moon,The Wall or Wish You Were Here but it's just as good!!! A treat from start to finish!!! Great musicianship!!! A classic!!! Five stars!!! A+
B00005MP58|5.0|This is an absolutely brilliant adaptation of Jane Austens classic.  It follows the story precisely and will make you fall in love all over again with the romantic love story.  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle's chemistry is unbeatable.  They both bring their characters to life with outstanding acting.  It is like witnessing the event.  This is a must see if you have read the book.  I absolutely love it!
B000002UA0|5.0|This great debut album from Floyd is the one that has Syd Barrett!!! A great album!!! A sixties classic!!! Five stars!!! A+
B000059HB7|3.0|The star of this movie is Dean Martin, the lovable drunk.  Wayne seems almost a spectator at times, playing the father to the rag tag bunch.  The movie makes little sense and at times seems so silly as to be satirical.  yes, the story movies all over the place and is essentially  an assortment of skits, some good, some not.  All the same, it is loads of fun, and not your usual goof ball western.  The rabid dialogue of Dickens is hilariously dumb and accentuates my point-grab a six pack and enjoy a Wayne Western that does not take it self too seriously.

B0000CD5FN|5.0|Punk legend Joe Strummer was working on his fourth solo album when he died suddenly in December 2002 of a heart attack. The former frontman of the Clash did manage to complete 10 songs that stand as some of the greatest music he ever recorded. With his band, the Mescaleros, Strummer created a masterpiece and it has the same passion and energy since the London Calling days of the Clash. And it's diverse too, with just 10 songs at 41 minutes! &quot;Coma Girl,&quot; the first track, flat out rocks, and his natural blend of rock and punk are also in songs like &quot;Arms Aloft&quot; and &quot;All in a Day.&quot; &quot;Ramshackle Day Parade&quot; and &quot;Burnin Streets&quot; are rock anthems, and rather leftist political songs (imagine &quot;London Calling&quot; or &quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot; meets Springsteen's &quot;Born to Run.&quot;), and he reveals his acoustic side with a moving rendition of Bob Marley's &quot;Redemption Song&quot; and his own folk song, &quot;Long Shadow.&quot; &quot;Midnight Jam&quot; is a rock jam, sort of like one you wuld find on Sandinista! and Combat Rock, minus the reggae and the dub. &quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot; is a humorous finale to what should have been a new beginning, with folk and lounge influences.<br />As much as this is a cohesive piece of work, and as much as it was a victory for Strummer, Streetcore is also an intensely bitterwseet listen. It doesn't feel complete, due to his sudden demise, and Strummer still seemed like he still had volumes to say and many things to accomplish. Unlike other posthumous efforts, like George Harrison's &quot;Brainwashed&quot; and Warren Zevon's &quot;The Wind,&quot; this is definitely incomplete. Yet Zevon and Harrison knew that the end was near (both battled cancer) and both were surprisingly subtle when they said farewell. in Strummer's case, hwoeverm his voice was still fiery and passionate, and he still had music left to create. Especially in &quot;Ramshackle Day Parade&quot; and &quot;Redemption Song&quot; his voice reosnates more than it ever had, and it makes his passing even more tragic. Regardless of the tragedy, this is an awesome eulogoy to one of the most influential and significant voices in rock music, and his visions of how effective music can be are clearly defined and fully realized on Streetcore.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|The last issue of an amazing and talentes person...when you listen to it, every song takes you throught a new emotion
B000089RVX|1.0|You have to be kidding me.  Grammy nominations?  Digidesign (the maker of Pro Tools) should be getting the grammy for this one.  Has anyone ever heard this wretched &quot;band&quot; peform live?  This album is 100% product of digital production and editing.  From one end to another overdramatic singing with not a hint of subtlety, variation, or dynamics.  It's cold, lifeless, sterile, and boring.  Yet the masses lap it up like kittens.  I weap for our culture that people will buy anything that is packaged, processed, and rammed down their throats.   What's happened with Evanescence is the new model for the reeling recording industry.  Take a few acts and RAM them down everyone throats until they buy.  And if you fall for it, you only have yourself to blame.  Evanescence are a musical Big Mac. Sucker.
B0000VAFNQ|1.0|Man a former ( get that FORMER) girl of mine dragged me in to see this and I will tell you it's the worst way to spend $15.  It was a stupid movie...there really was no point and definitely no hook to make me care about what happens or what didn't happen to these characters.  The story was just stupid.  It was too much fighting going on everytime you wake up from your sleep they're fighting...as a matter of fact that was what kept me awake...soon as they start fighting it gets loud waking me up from my slumber.  The movie was also too long...if it was shorter maybe I would have liked it more.  The mood is always dark, gloomy, and shadowy.  The things didn't smile or laugh too often and the actors were second rate barely holding my attention on screen.  Apparently this movie comes out tomorrow on DVD so i hope you don't get gypped into seeing it as I did.  Don't waste your time or money.
0754014975|2.0|Picked up this book after having heard it was funny, informative, and easy to read. Within the first few pages i became disillusioned! It's hard not to be really, when Mr Bryson refers to spiders as insects, and in his initial segment to point out &quot;some facts&quot;, states that Australia is a single island continent. I'd be curious as to which continent New Zealand belongs to then? Maybe Australasia ceased to be in the day he lost crossing the date line? Having spent over a quater of a year in Oz some of his comments managed to make me chuckle, especially regarding Red Back Spiders, but on the whole i was disappointed. At the price, i'm not inspired to buy another of his titles.

0066620996|5.0|Some reviews say that the book does not apply to all organizations b/c of the type of companies selected for the study (e.g. public vs privately owned). However, readers should not get hung up on minutae but look a the larger concepts imparted by this book. I view it as a good general blueprint for willing a company toward success. For those business people with aims to join the executive ranks (or for those already there) this book is as necessary as any other book on management. An advantage Good to Great possesses is that it goes about its inquiry in - for the most part - a structured way, attempting to prove or disprove assumptions we have about what great management is.
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown did a wonderful job on making me question what I thought I knew about history and  my own religon.  . He brings up many interesting points, and has evidence to back them up. However, I did not think that the plot was as important as him conveying his theories and facts.I think that he was too busy at the beginig of the book to set you up with history and every single symbolic pose, he forgot how to end a good book!!!!
B000068PQ0|5.0|The Flaming Lips followed their masterpiece, 'The Soft Bulletin,' with this, a concept album EP linked to a collection of beautiful, strange songs about love and death. The first four tracks refer to the title of the album. Yoshimi battles pink robots to a 'kitchen sink' soundtrack --- the band combines everything from techno-pop to acoustic dirges into a vague story.<br />Then the album opens up. 'In the Morning of the Magicians' and 'Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell' are the high points of the disc. They transmit you from Yoshimi to the super-bright pop songs that close the CD. The final four are simple, introspective ballads that sound a lot like Beck's 'Sea Change.' The whole thing ends with a fantastic instrumental about ballooning across Mars.<br />In a perfect world, this album would win every Grammy and be played over and over on the radio. But I guess I can settle for owning it and listening to it all day at home. After this CD and 'The Soft Bulletin,' the Lips are on a roll. I can't wait to hear  what they'll do next.
0156027321|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It took a few chapters to get into it. I don't see the relation of the 3 religions to the main plot, however, it was interesting.<br />I enjoyed every aspect of the zoo animals. I thought there were a lot of interesting facts about the various animals.  I thought the story line was unique and enjoyable. (Just don't read this while eating)  Highly recommend this book.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I first started listening to Sarah when I watched City of Angels and was hooked on the song Angel.  From there I bought the Surfacing Album and was hooked on her music ever since.  Afterglow is an amazing release.  The song Fallen is a strong start to a wonderful album.  This is an album you can listen to in the car, at home, or anywhere and just get lost in the music.  In today's age of music it is refreshing to hear an album like Afterglow come out with music that just takes you to a place outside of all the stress, and frustration of life as it is today.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes good music.  If you have not heard Sarah Mclachlan before you should start with Afterglow and go from there.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is by far one of the most absolute best foreign films I have ever scene.  Like a critic said this is the &quot;feel good movie of the year&quot;.  It's colorful, vibrant, silly and amusing.  How wonderful it is.  If you like the simple pleasures in life this movie would be perfect for you.
0385504209|5.0|I'd been hearing about this book from almost everyone I knew, so I got it out of the library (after a 1 month wait, may I add).  I opened it last night, expecting to read a few chapters and then to go to bed.  Well, luckily I didn't have work today...I was up all night reading until my eyes couldn't stay open anymore.<br />The central questions of the book revolve around spirituality and the nature of Christian tradition and faith.  It throws into question the nature of the Holy Grail, and the version of history that the Catholic Church would have us believe.  Granted, these are theories that have been put forth by many scholars, and Brown is merely drawing upon their work, but he weaves fact and fiction together into a rich tapestry.<br />However, the book is so much more.  Brown is one of the few authors who can change viewpoint well.  His characters are well written, the plot is paced well, and the two twists at the end surprising.  The meat of the book will give you something to think about...well, unless you're a sheep and prefer to follow blindly rather than think for yourself.<br />I strongly recommend the book.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is one of the best albums of 2003.  Radiohead is making different music in each album, and Hail to the Thief is not an exception.  Radiohead mark their evolution once again.  Each song starts to grow on you as it gets louders and more instrument begin talking: 2 + 2 = 5, Sit Down Stand Up, There There... They all overwhelm you by the middle of the song.  <BR>&quot;Are you such a dreamer to put the world to rights?&quot;  There is a trace of despair, but after a few times &quot;You have not been paying attention&quot; you start to be apologetic... perhaps to become another dreamer.<br />Sit Down, Stand Up.  But they don't obey you.  Radiohead has achieved so much through their refusal to make music like other bands.  Sit Down Stand Up accentuates their loathe for passive comply with authorities.  <BR>Of course, it means even more when you put it in the political context of 2003 and Iraq.  I Will is another song that more directly talks about loss and revenge.  But with Radiohead, you always have the option to understand each song the way you want.  <br />We Suck You Blood is a one of the best tracks in this album.  The words are very simple but the meanign is very deep.  &quot;We you hungery?  Are You sick?  Are you begging for a break?&quot;  And a hand-clap at the end of each question materialising an imaginatively affirnative answer.  <br />Keep listening to Hail to the Thief.  Everytime, you will find something new.
B00005Y7NK|2.0|... and every career must have a nadir.<BR>In Sabbath's defense, the late 80's were not the greatest period for hard rock/heavy metal.  On one side were the glam bands (Poison, Warrant, etc.) and on the other were the thrash/speed metal bands (Testament, Metallica, etc.).  So there really wasn't much of a niche for Black Sabbath in 1989.<BR>The personnel on this album:<BR>Tony Iommi - guitars (of course)<BR>Lawrence Cottle - bass (who?)<BR>Geoff Nichols - keyboards<BR>Cozy Powell - drums<BR>Tony Martin - vocals<br />Cozy Powell performs *brilliantly* on this album!  Unfortunately, the drums are washed out with reverb.  The bass is mixed somewhat low, so Cottle may very well be a virtuoso, who can tell?  Geoff Nichols does a great job of making the album sound &quot;modern&quot; - which now dates the album pretty seriously.<BR>Tony Martin.  He's got a great voice.  Range.  Power.  Consistency.  So what's wrong?  He doesn't have as much vocal *personality* as either Ozzy or Dio.<BR>It goes without saying that Tony Iommi plays fantastically on the album, even though the riffs are fairly pedestrian for a Sabbath album.  It sounds like he's updated his style even, using finger-tapping for the &quot;Devil and Daughter&quot; solo for some reason.<BR>&quot;Gates of Hell&quot; starts it all off, which is essentially a bunch of spooky keyboard noises, leading straight into...<BR>The &quot;Headless Cross&quot;.  Supposedly there's a story about a bolt of lightning hitting a cross and destroying it and the entire neighboring village died, whatever.  You can't tell from the lyrics.  The riffs aren't very exciting, and Martin shrieking &quot;THE HEEAAADLESS CROSS!&quot; makes your hair stand on end, though not in the way it was intended.<BR>&quot;Devil and Daughter&quot; uses the old &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; gallop, but this horse isn't really going anywhere.<BR>&quot;When Death Calls&quot; - gets off to a pretty start, interesting textures... but then it gets overblownand anthemic.  Brian May adds a solo, but it's difficult to tell.<BR>&quot;Kill in the Spirit World&quot; starts off like somewhat typical 1989 arena metal with a non-charismatic singer.  The chorus has a decently complex Iommi riff, but essentially this song comes and goes without leaving much of an impression.<BR>&quot;Call of the Wild&quot; alternates between sparse verses and an exotic snake-charming Nichols/Iommi riff that is kind of cool, but not very engaging.<BR>&quot;Black Moon&quot; shows promise at the very beginning with a heavy blues Iommi riff, then in comes the organ and Martin talking about &quot;oh the devil...&quot; Ugh.  Like most of these songs, the solo is great - but so what?<BR>&quot;Nightwing&quot; gets off to a pretty start, with some gentle arpeggios and tasteful organ.  Martin is much better suited to this style than the heavier material.  Some of the riffs are decent.  When the ballad is the best song on a Sabbath album, this is a problem.<br />It's hard to tell exactly what went wrong, as this is sandwiched between two decent albums (Eternal Idol, TYR).  Maybe it's because Ray Gillen wrote the lyrics/vocal melodies for Eternal Idol, and by TYR the band had gelled more.  Maybe the record company was like &quot;Okay, you need more songs where the guitar completely drops out for the verses and more songs where you say 'Satan' to appeal to your fan base.&quot;  Maybe they just needed to put out an album so they could tour, and fans would sit restlessly through the new material, waiting for &quot;War Pigs&quot;.<BR>Whatever reason, every band has to have a worst album.<BR>This is Sabbath's.
B000002UR7|4.0|Ten years later, it's so hard to believe that this is Radiohead.  This CD is more like classic rock, something you don't expect Radiohead to make.  In Pablo Honey, Radiohead have not still thrived enough to achieve their unique style.  Comparing to other rock CDs (by other bands), this album is quite good.  But if you compare this album with RADIOHEAD's later albums, this one is not as good as they are.  But it is necessary to listen to it in order to understand and enjoy Radiohead more.  When they made Pablo Honey, you wouldn't expect them to be one of the best alternative bands in the world.  It's quite amusing to listen to Pablo Honey in order to appreciate Radiohead's growth as a music band.  <br />i think Creep is overrated.  Even though its lyrics exemplify incongruity, rejection, and self-mockery, Creep is the one song that everyone remembers from this album.  Which does not do justice to the rest of the tracks.  There is Anyone Can Play Guitar, You, and other great songs that you have to remember.  <BR>You can see traces of similarity to Pablo Honey in The Bends.  But starting with OK Computer, each Radiohead's album has it's own style.  Each makes a particular entirety.  And that's what is fantastic about Radiohead: they're never the same.  <br />What is similar though is Tom Yorke's voice.  But that's also in its infancy in Pablo Honey!  Just compare it to Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box, or We Suck Young Blood... and you'll see how different he sounds.  <BR>The best thing about Pablo Honey is that it's the beginning: when we all started.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|If you like a funny movie with a good message, \\"About a Boy\\" is the perfect movie for you.  With Hugh Grant as one of the leading roles, this movie couldn't be any funnier.  If you are not English, and do not have an accent the movie isn't any less funny.  With scenes, such as Marcus (the boy Will-played by Hugh Grant-meets) throwing a loaf of his mother's \\"health\\" bread to the ducks and killing one, the movie is hilarious.  This movie is an awesome buy if you're looking to add another great movie to your collection.
B00005RHGK|1.0|A pile of forgettable rubbish that went absolutely nowhere, explained nothing, had a monster that looked like a guy in a rubber suit, and a CONVICTED molester of children for a director, this one is worth ZERO stars.  Too bad there's a one star minimum.  I wish I had not unwittingly put money into the pocket of this director.
0385504209|1.0|As a moderate Christian, I was looking forward to a wonderful read describing mysteries and codes beyond my dreams.  I finished the book, just barely.  The prose was poor and the surprises were all predictable.  Reading dry texts on the Holy Grail are far more satisfying.  I hope that the marriage described could have happened to intensify and both deify and humanize, Christ.  This book was only one list after another of dry information with the characters saying &quot;Oh&quot;.  I would not recommend the book but other books on the same topic.
0156027321|4.0|I was a bit hesitant to pick up Life of Pi because some of the reviews were unfavorable.  However, I found it to be a very enjoyable bit of fantasy.  Essentially a boy is trapped on a life boat with various animals including a tiger named Richard Parker.  The book focuses on the fight to survive as the boy and the tiger eventually realize they need each other to make it.  Well, not so much the boy needing the tiger but he does come to look at the animal as his friend.  You know, the type of friend that you have to keep a safe distance from and admire from a distance.  I would recommend it but like I said, I did see some unfavorable reviews citing the book as a bit slow.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As I watched the show on dvd all I could think of through out the whole thing was how sad it is that the show was cancelled. It is a wonderful show; full of great characters and amazing story lines. Another amazing creation of Joss Whedon.
0316666343|2.0|You know, I didn't care for this book very much at all.  The beginning of the book really got to me and stayed with me for awhile as the author painted a very vivid picture of the murder.  However, after that it just seemed to drag on forever.  I also felt a bit let down by the fate of the murderer.  I know that not every villian needs to &quot;get his&quot; in order to satisfy me but it just seemed to be a very anti-climatic end.  A well written book but I wouldn't recommend it.

6305095442|5.0|There are many reasons why this one is rated as the greatest Bruce Campbell film and the finest film that director Sam Raimi (Spider-man) has done to date. First of all the cinematography in this movie is hands down one of the best you will ever see for a film of its type because the camera swirls around the place as if attached to an anti-gravity device. The next is the outstanding acting ability of Mr. Campbell as he literally holds the screen by himself for the vast majority of this fun horror movie. One of the most notable scenes in this picture is Mr. Campbell beating up himself on the screen. It is downright hysterical and looks brutally real (because it is!). There is no doubt that this guy will do anything to please the audience and there is also no doubt that the director just loves to torture him. \\"Mr. Cambell, do you mind while I strap you to a plank of wood and then drive you at top speed through the bushes and trees while you spin around on its axis?\\" .... \\"Hell yeah, sure Mr. Raimi. Whatever you say. I just love being in your pictures.\\"<br />It is too hard to put down a single shot or scene in this movie as that which defines it. The whole thing from start to finish is just a fury of action that doesn't stop. This is also one of the best character build-ups in the history of cinema. At the start Ash (Bruce Campbell) is a sort of frightened scared little pissy-pants but by the end of the movie he is a fully fledged action hero with some wicked one-liners to boot. This film has some of the most memorable quotes in modern cinema.<br />Evil Dead II is largely a remake to the first Evil Dead movie but is also a sequel or can work as a stand alone vehicle. The premise is simple. Ash heads to a log cabin in the woods with his girlfriend and manages to wakeup the undead who turn his world, and cabin, upside down. There are things in the cellar, things in the woods and a chainsaw in the workshop.<br />There is no other film that moves at such pace and speed except maybe Black Hawk Down. Here Raimi conjures up scene by scene mayhem on a larger budget than his previous efforts and just keeps up the velocity relentlessly. It is no wonder why this film tops many fanboy polls as the greatest flick of all time.<br />In short you will be hard pressed to find a horror film with more action in it than Evil Dead II except for maybe Aliens, but then that is more of a Sci-Fi movie. If you have not seen Evil Dead II then it is about time that you did. This movie is a riot and is deserving of its everlasting repeating viewing appeal (And believe me fans do watch this one a couple of times a month).<br />One of the greatest shames in Cinema is that Hollywood has not been able to utilize or realize one of the finest B-movie actors of our generation. Maybe with Mr. Raimi picking up momentum there we just might get to see his lead star do more for the box office.<br />An essential for any horror/action fans collection.ept maybe Black Hawk Down.

B000001DTM|3.0|Not my favourite album.  I loved One and Until the End of the World.  The album was not cohesive.  Some of the songs sound like Josua Tree U2 and some others...are different.
B00006JDS4|1.0|I love horror movies and I am fan of most of them and will watch almost anything because I like the genre. For the first time I have witnessed something that I felt went beyond the accepted boundaries of art and certainly moved into the realm of films that feature unforgiving scenes like animal abuse (Cannibal Holocaust comes to mind). I would love to give this five stars but I will not because in my opinion this film has no place in cinema or on the video shelf. If anything this film should only be released as part of an art-house circuit or as film lecture material. I certainly believe that this film should not be available to all adults and should be accompanied by some sort of a follow-up lecture in which a professional explains to the viewer the problems that this type of film has on society. Sure it is daring and bold and tries to show us what is beyond our acceptable standard but it also presents an unpardonable and excessive amount of sexual violence towards human beings, especially women. I hope a film like this is never made again.<br />The film has pretty low production values and is a bit of a mix bag in terms of the quality of the acting on display. The sound is not very good and the execution of most of the dialogue is pretty poor. Where this film outrivals most for its type is in the brutality and its horrific chauvinism that reaches its peak in a very graphic thirty minute gang rape sequence that gives this film its notoriety. That actual sequence is made all the more brutal because one of the gang members has a mental age of about ten.<br />The premise is simple. Our protagonist is a young writer, played by Camille Keaton (Buster Keaton's grand-niece and the wife of this film's director) who journeys out to \\"redneck\\" county to write a book. There she is accosted by four hillbillies who proceed to do the deplorable with her in a very disturbing way that is often as violent as it sexually distressing. The problem with this sequence is that it lasts so long and in so many different locations as they drag their victim about the place. One could only imagine what purpose all of this serves and if the film is not just catering for a very unbalanced and criminal type of viewer. At the same time we can say that this is \\"just a movie\\" or \\"art\\" but it does go beyond that - especially when bottles are involved.<br />The question that is poised at the back of the mind when watching this (and it is not a very pleasant experience), is if this is just exploitation material or does it have some moral or underlying philosophy to explain its actions or why it should have been made in the first place? Maybe this is exploitation cinema just testing the limits of what it can do? Well the film makers have done just that, however the director has said that he made this movie to show the ugliness of its theme. Who does the director think he is fooling? This film is exploitation through and through with one true purpose - to abuse the protagonist, disturb the viewer and to provide the splatter for the gore hounds - nothing more, nothing less. This is not \\"The Accused\\" or \\"Irreversible\\". It is not even \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" or \\"Last House on the Left\\". This is akin to \\"Cannabis Holocaust\\" or \\"Cannabis Ferox\\". Not only is this movie prejudiced, sexist and down right cruel it also seems like potentially dangerous material for the more unhinged elements in our society.<br />The second half of the film concentrates on the victim's revenge for the crimes committed again her and this is really where the entertainment can be found in a short of female version of a Charles Bronson/Clint Eastwood vigilante retribution movie. To be honest the film would have been much better, and acceptable, if it cut down on the intensity of the sexual violence at the start of movie. Certainly there are a number of interesting segments, one involving a shopping delivery that plays itself out in a very strange way. One of the deviants also tries to justify his actions by blaming the victim instead. Another scene involves a very shocking dismemberment in the bathroom (very realistic). All in all the second half is quite interesting but the first half is revolting and disgusting and like I said, probably dangerous material in the wrong hands.<br />In short this movie has no place in cinema or in the video shelf. It should be part of art-house circuits or film lecture halls, period. I think this is the first time that banning a film makes sense. This is a rape movie that is unpleasant for most but gratifying for the maniacs that will enjoy it... over and over and over again.<br />This movie is just plain wrong.

B00005KARK|5.0|I do not agree with the parental advice given in other reviews not to show DUMBO to children.  As it is their opinion, I will give you mine.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with Dumbo.  Nothing in the movie will scar a child.  In fact, I remember latching onto my family as a young child after watching it.  It is a movie that really makes you be thankful for those around you.  I think it's one of the best Disney films ever made. Personally, I think it was made in the prime of Disney movies.  More recent Disney movies (made after Lion King and Aladin) don't even compare to the depths and wonder of the older classics. The animation is stunning for the time, and the little details and scenes are just wonderful. Although it is a sad watch, lessons are taught and it is just a great movie.<br />I'm VERY glad to have seen it quite a few times as a child.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This is a great album. Yes, it is more or less a step in a new direction for the band overall, but hints of this heaviness were on the last album (&quot;The Glass Prison,&quot; &quot;War Inside My Head&quot;) and really have always been there, somewhat. It takes a few listens to really get a handle on the music on this disc, perhaps more so than the band's previous few albums. I have realized that the more complex and unique the music, the more I have to listen to it before I feel comfortable talking about it. This album is indeed both complex and unique. Dream Theater has never been a band to hang their hats on the same musical hat stand all the time. The musical range from &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; to this album is mind-boggling, when you consider the two albums are only separated by 6 years. <br />This album does lack in certain areas, most of them related to production. Many of these have been talked about by other reviewers, but I will validate some of them. <br />-John Myung's bass needs to be higher in the mix, with a little more treble thrown in as well. When you double the guitar often, as he does, you need to set your bass sound apart in some way.<BR>-there are several annoying, doctored vocal parts. Other than some rare exceptions (i.e. Radiohead), I don't care for them.<BR>-what is up with the pottymouths? I want to play &quot;As I Am&quot; for my students, so I guess I'll have to get the radio edit version.<BR>-John Petrucci's performances tend to lean towards playing as fast as humanly possible. Bluesy bends and arpeggios are becoming extinct in his soloing.<br />Ignoring these exceptions, this is a stunning album. James LaBrie's singing continues to get better and better, and his vocal arrangements have allowed him to do that. His vocal parts are more pure and classically oriented than ever, with longer phrases that flow better. Despite most fans' adoration for &quot;Awake,&quot; many of his vocal parts on that album were filled with vocal impurities- growling, speak-singing, and disjointed lines that did not flow well (ex. &quot;6:00&quot; verse, &quot;Lie&quot; verse, &quot;Caught In A Web&quot; verse). Just listen to the chorus of &quot;In the Name of God&quot; for an example of this. John's guitar work on &quot;This Dying Soul&quot; is phenomenal, I feel his best work on the album. Mike Portnoy is brilliant as always. The songs are amazing. You try to play them!

B00000255O|4.0|Man-Child is another strong electronic jazz-funk album from Herbie Hancock. Although it's not as consistent or creative as Headhunters or Thrust, it's still pretty good. The opening track \\"Hang Up Your Hang Ups\\", with its snappy horn lines and funky guitar, is easily the best track here. Herbie has a great solo near the end of the track as well. \\"The Traitor\\", with its funky bass line, and \\"Heartbeat\\", which has a great hook and more great playing from Herbie, are great as well. \\"Steppin' In It\\" is a cool little jam featuring Stevie Wonder on harmonica. The remaining tracks \\"Sun Touch\\" and \\"Bubbles\\" are decent ballads, with the latter being the stronger of the two. A solid album. It's worth checking out just for \\"Hang Up Your Hang Ups\\", one of the best from his funk era.
B00005JM02|5.0|&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; finds the Pixar animation studio back in top form after their somewhat disappointing (I thought) &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; This group has always had a knack for finding source material that will give them full freedom in unleashing their animation imaginations (the toy-chest world of &quot;Toy Story,&quot; the insect world of &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot;) and in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; they take us underwater and show us the beauty, wonder, and danger of the sea. There are any number of jaw-dropping set pieces in this film: a field of jellyfish, a shark attack, a mass escape from a fishing net.  As usual, Disney fills its film with liberal messages about the treatment of wildlife and the environment, much welcome and needed messages in my opinion.  But great animation alone cannot sell me on an animated movie--that's done with the quality of the story and characters, and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; delivers there as well.  The Pixar movies are never as cloying as the traditionally animated films produced by Disney--there's always a drier, cheekier brand of humour, and you get the feeling that just as many jokes are aimed at the adult audience as at the kids.  The voices are terrific, the story is quick and funny, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing.<br />Grade: A
B00005UKE0|5.0|We all remember with great sadness the loss of George Harrison two winters ago.  George's official website at the time offered us a screensaver featuring the 2000 version of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;.  I believe, as one or two other review writers, that this is undoubtedly George at his very finest.  As a young Canadian backpacking around Europe in 1970-71, I can never forget the day I first heard &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; in an American friend's home in Lisbon, Portugal.  Now, thirty years on, a much wiser George while suffering from cancer was able to offer us his eternal hymn one last time.  The entire album is a gem, but &quot;My Sweet Lord 2000&quot; is the most moving, heartfelt version of any song George has ever recorded.  Please, listen to George on this particular cut and remember when he recorded it.  A dying star's trail of brilliance!  A twelve minute version of this beautiful song would have done it justice to my mind!  I'm an aging &quot;boomer&quot; and have never written a review in my life, so aren't you tempted to heed my words and savour this incredible album?  Ten brilliant stars for &quot;My Sweet Lord 2000&quot;!  Who agrees with me?
B00005JMCN|1.0|Using your copy of &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; to set drinks on would be a more interesting use for it than actually playing the boring thing.  Oh, what a safe, boring, dull movie this is.  Gary Ross obviously went to the Ron Howard school of directing, where points are pounded home with a hammer and anvil and manipulated emotions are manufactured with assembly-line rapidity. This is the kind of movie where everyone delivers lines that sound like they should be on self-help bumper stickers; homilies are handed out like parking tickets. And the movie doesn't end until each character gets to deliver at least one clunker, and most of them get to deliver many more.<br />&quot;Seabiscuit&quot; isn't even really a bad movie--it's an uninteresting movie, which is much worse.  Even bad movies can be fascinating, but the filmmakers here aim so low at trying to please the lowest common denominator of viewer that they've put together a batch of pandering mush that has not one genuine emotion in it.<br />Yuck...

B00005JLSE|4.0|In Brief<br />Roxie Hart (Zellweger) dreams of singing and dancing in the vaudeville shows of a 1929 Chicago like her idol Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones).  Yet a few wrong steps lead to Roxie living her life on murderers row in the Cook County Clink.  A grim dank lock up she finds herself under the crooked care of the prison Matron Morton (Latifah), who puts Roxie in touch with the legendary lawyer Billy Flynn (Gere).  Milking her husband (Reily) for Flynn's fees, Roxie soon finds herself shot into the limelight created by the media frenzy surrounding her case.  With her career exploding her fellow inmate &amp; former idol Miss Kelly is less than impressed, but need she be worried or will the flavour of the month soon shift once again.     <br />Review<br />This is not Moulin Rouge and that's neither a good or bad thing as this is Chicago.  One of the biggest hits of the West End &amp; Broadway hits the silver screen with a bang, yet this not just the stage show, this is pure genius.  Taking the song and dance show from the stage was never going to be easy and indeed it has been attempted numerous times in the past but never made it into production.   The problem has always been that Chicago is a theatrical show of pure vaudeville and that wont translate to the cinema, but one day when he was meant to be promoting the conception of the film of Rent to Miramax honchos, director Rob Marshall suddenly had an epiphany regarding Chicago where all the musical elements would take the form of asides or exist as pure fantasy primarily through the mind of Roxie Hart.  <br />A simple premise becomes a stroke of genius, as the audience becomes drawn into a world that quickly sets up its own conventions of communication.  The ease with which this is done demonstrates an understated talent that can only be highlighted here.  One quickly finds the musical elements of the film are never out of sync with the timing of the narrative, lend both poignancy &amp; humour to the film, while always leaving you wanting more each time a number ends.  Indeed one can't help but feel that Marshall is the Billy Flynn we never see, as he razzle dazzles us and gives us our own \\"show that is so spendiflorus.\\"  <br />So what of the singing?  Well like the strength of the cast it can't be faulted as each seems to meld their persona so well into their performance.  Indeed the cast is solid throughout and the cameos by Mya and Lucy Lui are lovely.  One could question the highness of Gere's tone but that aside the stand out performer is without a doubt Zellweger who is both stunning &amp; glamorous, yet vulnerable &amp; fragile which she can communicate through not only acting but also song thus displaying sheer brilliance on her part.  A special mention should also be made of John C. Reily's Amos, never before has anyone captured Mr. Cellophane with such heart.  If you leave this film without feeling higher than you when you came in check your pulse as this had me singing along to the Cell Block Tango and definitely had all that jazz!  <br />The Verdict<BR> <BR>If the dance numbers that are both a combination of traditional Fosse and more contemporary styles don't impress you, the melding of story and musical into the narrative certainly will.  Yes this is a musical but suspend your disbelief and let Chicago tempt you with the darkest story of treachery, betrayal and murder you'll ever see twisted into a song and dance show.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Listen up all you Science fiction fans out there, this is by far the best television series I have ever seen, I have not even seen all the episodes yet and I love it. The characters a great, the story is superb and the effects are spectacular. This is a great show that fox screwed up. If you'r a fan of Science Fiction and dont have this DVD I have lost all respect I might have had for you!<BR>-A Firefly Fan
B00005JLRT|4.0|In Brief<br />Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his crew take to the galaxy again on a diplomatic mission to initiate peace with the Romuluns. But upon arrival on the alien planet, the crew is faced with a threat that could lead to the Earth's destruction, and Picard meets his most dangerous adversary yet.<br />Review<br />Love them or hate them, the Next Generation crew are back for what may be their last voyage - though rumour has it there may be one last trip before their retirement so don't get too upset just yet.  Well not at least until you have seen the end of this film which features a departure of a key cast member.  <BR>So what of the film?  Well it being an even numbered release, number ten to be exact, it bodes well as they avoid the curse this time around and provide one their better films to date.  <br />While its not as action packed as First Contact, there is still enough to wet many appetites &amp; to be honest this as true to form as the quality episodes that the Next Generation produced towards the end of its seven year run on TV.  Nemesis provides enough intrigue and drama so as not to patronise its audience yet it doesn't go to far as to isolate anyone that doesn't know their tricorder from their transporter.  <br />For the Trekkies out there this is the first time I can recall that we have seen the Romulun home world, but feel free to correct me if I am wrong.  Tom Hardy plays the villain of the piece, Shinzon a being that is a clone of Picard and indeed the nemesis of the film.  Yet the Captain is not the only one with an opposite in the film as Data discovers an earlier prototype of himself who is appropriately named B-4.  While the various back stories run parallel with the action, the main thrust of the narrative comes from the interaction of the two pairs, indeed the competition, love and the way in which Shinzon &amp; Picard eventually despise one another provides so perfectly matched a delivery that you could be excused to think that these were relatives caught in a long running feud rather than something that has been artificially thrust into existence.   <br />The Verdict<br />It may not be your first choice for a Friday night out but to be honest this far superior to many of the popcorn Sci Fi or Action flicks that have been on offer in your multiplex in the past few months.  It caters for both the fan and those that haven't seen Star Trek ever before.  This film is a pleasure to watch as it combines both the action and drama to a pitch that neither falters or leaves you wanting more.

B00005JLR2|3.0|In Brief<br />The legendary loot of a thousand worlds inspires an intergalactic treasure hunt when fifteen year old Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gorden-Levitt) stumbles upon a map to the greatest pirate trove in the universe.  Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island Classic novel, the film follows Jim's fantastic journey across a parallel universe as a cabin boy aboard a space-galleon.  Blossoming under the guidance of the cyborg cook John Silver (Brian Murray), Jim and the alien crew battle supernovas, black holes and ferocious space storms on their quest for the gold, but none of this can compare to deadly dangers that lay ahead.   <br />Review<br />One can't help but recall the surrealism of Yellow Submarine when watching this film, as the characters and even the concept of wooden Galleons with engines large enough to put the Millennium Falcon to shame fill a universe of oddly proportioned aliens and robots.  Indeed, ignoring the insanity of an open decked ship in the vacuum of space, one can't help but think the romance of a feline captain and a scientist with canine origins is a little more than disturbing.  Yet this is Disney, and all is pure and good when it comes to cross breeding of two species.  <br />Seriously, Treasure Planet is an enjoyable romp through Stevenson's original classic, and while purists may have palpitations at the liberties that have been taken with the source material, the bottom line is that it is a thoroughly enjoyable family film.  Martin Short's portrayal of B.E.N., a robot with a short circuit, is hilarious and recalls memories of Robin Williams turn as the Genie in Aladdin.  David Hyde Pierce, making his second outing as a vocal talent in a Disney Film following A Bugs Life, is perfectly sardonic and draws knowingly from his successful performance as Niles in the TV sitcom Fraser.  While Levitt, who made himself famous through his portrayal of Tommy in Third Rock from the Sun, is refreshingly straight as the teenage hero Jim.  <br/>Its the roughness of the animation that in my opinion really lets this film down.  While it isn't bad by any standard, it doesn't have the flair of a Disney film, and near the introduction of Thompson's feline captain there are some glaringly obvious vocal-sync problems in matching the voice to the characters mouth.  Indeed, this just doesn't have the magic of a Disney theatrical release and will more likely become a popular home video classic, as it lacks the grandeur and set pieces of some of their better know products.     <br />The Verdict<br />Treasure Planet is a good film that lacks something at its core.  It will make a great half term treat and adults will enjoy it as much as their children, but Disney needs to refill their salt shaker of Magic if this is all that they can muster.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|I have to say that even though I do not speak French, I LOVED this album and play it constantly. Celine sounds sooo good here. I was very surprised that I am enjoying an album with songs that I don't completely understand. Celine should be very proud of herself to have created such a fine package of music. &quot;Mon Homme&quot; is beautifully touching. Very understated but very powerful just the same. In &quot;Je Lui Dirai&quot;  Celine lets loose at the end with a glorious note! To sum it up, BUY THIS ALBUM. It is so nice to have an artist out there that is truly talented and has a true instrument like Celine. Especially with all the singer wanna-be's on the charts.
B00008EYA5|2.0|It may have pulled in the big bucks Stateside but S.W.A.T. is no more than a major disappointment.  Predictable from the offset, the story runs like a bad plot from a cheesy Cable TV series.  Indeed it actually works more like the pilot to a new cop show where a group, carefully selected for their fighting skills, though shunned by their piers, form the ultimate team, make good, prove their critics wrong &amp; never forget to look good even in the toughest situation.  Make sure you represent your strongest audience markets by including key ethnic minorities in the team, plus throw in a few double-crosses &amp; personal demons to fight and surely you can't go wrong can you?   <br />Unfortunately you can, as what could have been a kick-ass action flick dumbs-down yet again to be awarded the lucrative 12A (in the UK), resulting in what amounts to nothing more than a poor imitation of the A-Team on steroids.  With the most pointless script of the year to boot there is little to redeem S.W.A.T. aside from some pacey set pieces &amp; the ever watchable Samuel L. Jackson.   <br />Standout Scene:  Amongst the dirge of pointless popcorn moments comes a corny high when the team kick back, bond with a few drinks, &amp; attempt to hum the theme to the original 70's S.W.A.T. TV series.
B0000DCGT5|3.0|I didn't expect a 3rd movie to work, I thought they should stop after part 2. I was wrong though. Although a lot of the cast from the first one didn't return, the movie is still hilarious. When you think about it, the ones that returned are the ones that made the movies so strong in the first place anyway. Okay Shannon Elizibeth isn't back and yes she is sexy but  she was awful in the last one. Chris Klein played the normal one of the gang....so who needs him lol. They should've at least mentioned his character once though since he was supposed to be their good friend.<br />  Anyway the movie would be totally pointless if Sean William Scott didn't return as Stiffler. Okay he has a little too much screen time and that laugh he does can get annoying too. However the movie smartly handles his character. He's supposed to be an annoying big mouthed jerk. That's why Jim (Jason Biggs) doesn't want him at his wedding. So Stiffler does everything he can to be part of the wedding. All that is hilarious too. We also get to see that he has a bit of a sensitive side a long the way as well.<br />  The scenes where Finch ( Eddie Kaye Thomas)  acts like Stiffler in-order to impress Michelle's sister is very funny too. Stiffler and Finch both have eyes for the same girl. Stiffler thinks he needs to act like Finch to get her and Finch thinks he needs to act like Stiffler. The result is hilarious. Lugene Levy (Jim's dad) is another strong point of the all the movies and they'd be boring without his pep talks that always embarrass Jim as well. So all the people that were the funniest in the other films are back and it makes for one entertaining movie.
B00005JMCW|1.0|Avoid at all costs!  Don't let your lass drag you to this steaming pile of sentimental manure.  When most sequels are waste of time why didn't the alarm bells ring when a remake of a Disney film, adapted from a book aimed at prissy teenage girls was slated for production.  <br />Don't be fooled!  This is the sort of waste of time that may lure you into thinking that it's worth seeing by chucking one of three good laughs from the middle 30 minutes of comedy in a short trailer.  Secondly, you may actually find the feminising effects take a hold as you sit hand in hand with your girl and begin to enjoy the `emotional journey' of the characters on the screen.  <br />What's the cure?  If you are dragged into this Freaky sweet world you have three options.  A: Find a new girlfriend.  B: Request that your girl watches one of `your' films in exchange.  If she questions this, simply say that you want to share new experiences together.  C:  Close your eyes &amp; pray that you will survive!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Underworld is a great looking movie that has a similar look and feel to it as films like the Matrix and the Crow. The way Kate Beckinsale (Pearl Harbor) is dressed in all leather sis even sort of a rip-off of Trinity in the Matrix. Hey though she looks great so I'm not going to complain lol. The movie is hard to follow somtimes though. It throws too much at you in one movie and it becomes to complexed to follow. Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman (Felicity) don't really have great chemestry either eventhough they are good in their roles.<br />  I mean we know why he likes her, I mean mmmm lol. We don't know why she is willing to risk everything for him though when she hardly even knows him. Still though Kate Beckinsale surprisingly is in strong heroine form and it's impressive since she's been in basically only romance movies before this. She handles the role well even if she comes off as more of a super model with attitude than a vampire. Anyway I always wanted to see a vampires vs werewolves movie and we get that with Underworld. There's not really enough action with them verse each other though. Yes they shoot at each other but I'd rather see more of them actually fighting. It's still pretty cool though. I think the werewolves look better than most werewolves have looked. Underworld is a fun movie that you'll enjoy more if you just sit back and let the action wash over you.
B00005JKN9|2.0|In Brief<br />Gangs of New York follows the story of Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio), a young Irish-American immigrant, who after 15 years is released from prison and returns to the Five Points - a place of debauchery and corruption and home to the lower classes of Manhattan.  His return is motivated by revenge, as he seeks William Cutting a.k.a. Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis), the powerful anti-immigrant gang leader who killed Amsterdam's father.  After infiltrating Bill's gang, things become complicated as the Butcher becomes the father figure that was so sorely lacking throughout his years of growth and to add an unplanned spice to the mix, he meets Jenny Everdeane (Diaz) an enigmatic pickpocket whose fierce independence and beauty captivate him.  Yet like everyone in the Five Points, Jenny is not all she seems and her past, like his own, soon begins to complicate his plans.<br />Review<br />Martin Scorsese is one of the great auteurs of the past thirty years, and while some have disliked his recent efforts that came in the form of Kundun or Bringing out the Dead they were still recognisable as Scorsese films.  He is responsible for some of the defining classics of cinema and the iconic images of Taxi Driver, Goodfellas &amp; Raging Bull are consistently featured in Top Movie polls.  Gangs of New York however is barely recognisable as sharing any cinematic traits that the great man has employed to date.<br />The entertainment provided here is very similar to Titanic and like the glossy reworking of that film, Gangs is a tin can with very little content.  The only weight lent to the film comes from Neeson who unfortunately bows out early on and the momentum he provides is not enough to fuel three hours of a simplistic revenge story that would be more at home in a TV movie.  DiCaprio doesn't fail to produce his standard annoying youth, as he continues to craft a persona that he inflicts upon audiences with a regular basis.  Diaz is strong throughout though any scope for her to fully engage with her character seems to have been stifled in its growth and this is nowhere near her pinnacle performance seen in Being John Malkovich.  Giving Day-Lewis the benefit of the doubt, it appears he realises the type of film he is within and builds a solid two dimensional performance around The Butcher, who like Alan Rickman's Sheriff in Robin Hood and the Prince of Thieves, is a beautiful mixture of the camp comic villain complete with tilted top hat and bloody clever.<br />Opening with a shot of The Priest (Neeson) shaving his face with a blade that smoothly slits the rough mask of hair from his face before accidentally slipping into the flesh of his skin, one recalls Scorsese's early avant-garde anti-Nam short The Big Shave (1967).  Yet any hope that this brief homage held quickly evaporates; like the Priest's words to his son, \\"you always leave the blood on the blade\\" and Gangs of New York left a bad taste in my mouth.  It was a production shrouded in secrecy and little has been mentioned of the reasons for it running over schedule and budget.  A project that has been 30 years on the shelf for Scorsese was first heard of entering pre-production over 3 years ago.  The pacing is jumpy at best, and one can't help but feel that there is a lot more of this film on the cutting room floor rather than in the film proper.  Watching the finished result there is definitely a feeling that this was a movie that was constructed in the edit room rather than in its planning and one can't help but wonder that the story behind the film maybe more interesting than the film itself.<br />The Verdict<br /><br />With a sigh there is something that sinks to the pit of my stomach when a period film uses modern music to score and motivate the narrative.  Like the abysmal Plunkett &amp; Maclean I knew there was something wrong when Gangs opened with some bass beats, yet I lost all hope when it closed to U2's Hands that built America.  So much had been riding on Scorsese's opus magnum and unfortunately the worst crime will be that mainstream audiences may associate him with this rather than his earlier work.  Hopefully people will take it as an enjoyable though sorely lacking film that once seen is best forgotten.  This is what Hollywood excels at: laminated history in all its Technicolor glory.rsese's opus magnum and unfortunately the worst crime will be that mainstream audiences may associate him with this rather than his earlier work.

0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is a book where the saying &quot; don't judge a book by it's cover&quot; can really be applied. The cover of the book , to a passing onlooker, would portray the book angled towards kids. Don't let it fool you, again it's for everyone! The book's setting is in the future, where the human race is fighting against the aliens and where every possible option is considered, including training kids to become future commanders and colonels. Such is the case of Andrew Wiggen , otherwise known as Ender. He always hated to be different, but when he though he would no longer be different , things worsen. Especially, because he is a natural born leader and a genius. Card's book is one filled with adventure in every page to keep you wanting to read more and more.
B00008LDPU|4.0|In Brief<br />Combining styles of animation from CGI to anime, to traditional western animation, here nine short films expand the universe &amp; mythology of The Matrix.  Bringing together veteran talent from both Japan &amp; America the Wachowski brothers hand picked and personally approved each story and variation on theme.  With such legends as Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll), Peter Chung (Aeon Flux), Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop) and Andy Jones (Final Fantasy) displaying their wares the Animatrix has arrived.  <br />Review<br />The Matrix on its original release changed the film industry forever, its influence could be seen in its contemporaries, parodies, TV shows and even nature documentaries.  Yet the environment and famous fight scenes were primarily inspired by Japanese Anime; the animated form of Manga whose cult following in the western world cannot even mirror its mainstream success in its native homeland.  Classic works in this medium such as Mamoru Oshii's Ghost In The Shell &amp; Katshuhiro Otomo's Akira have often being cited by the brothers as a driving force in the creation of The Matrix.  Therefore an Anime anthology seemed the perfect way in which to suggest the full richness of the world they had created and was an ideal way to explore background &amp; sub-plots that until now had never been realised before.  <br />Most similar in style to the Oshii &amp; Otomo's work is the brilliant The Second Renaissance by Mahiro Maeda that flows directly into the storyline of the recent feature films.  Here with stunning passion Maeda tells the story, in far more detail than before, of how the machines &amp; the humans destroyed one another resulting in a power-shift that would leave the world devastated.  This is the closest that an anime has come to in leaving ones heart pounding with the same fear &amp; sadness that Akira did many years ago.  Each of the shorts that follow will leave many a spine tingling with anticipation for the next.  <br />Unexpectedly each short takes the viewer on a new tangent away from the source material and none of the work can be faulted in any way.  Three worthy of higher praise are: Worlds Record, in which the world of an athletes existence is questioned in a visually shocking &amp; invigorating manner. Here in the final race one can almost feel every foot fall shuddering through your body as the central character heads towards the finish line.  Next up is the innovative Kid's Story where the entire reality &amp; existence of the feature films are put into question as parallels are made between fantasy &amp; the reality of a dysfunctional teenager who believes he is being called.  The result is shocking and the most relevant to a contemporary audience that obsesses after a cheap thrill rather than content.  Finally the Final Flight of the Osris is the culmination of work from the groundbreaking bankrupt studio that produced the Final Fantasy movie.  Working off models that were produced for Fantasy, the perfectly named Final Flight will make you question just how long it will be before people are replaced, in films at least, as a superbly animated sequence goes as far as to rival the trilogy &amp; set a new standard.  Not only is it slick but scarily its rough &amp; sensual enough to appear real.  Like all of the work on offer here the Animatrix has taken us to the next level.  <br />The Verdict<br />I can't remember when I last felt so blown away by any form of animation, let alone one that is premiering on the small screen.  This is a collection of work to outshine all others &amp; works perfectly in conjunction with the main movies that established this universe.  The Animatrix will reign supreme for a long time to come as everything that follows will be judged against what this work has achieved.
B00008PW2D|4.0|I read the reviews here, and felt the same way -- Season five was the shortest, most disappointing season of them all. And the same price for just two discs! Oy! But then I bought it, and started watching, certain I could breeze through these as a refresher before the last eight episodes of season six. Much to my surprise, I found myself watching each episode a couple of times. These eight episodes, more than any other, humanized the four women. Lonely, frustrated, and determined, the four main characters put out some of the funniest and most touching moments in the show's history. I almost forgive them for season five being so short!
B00005JLD4|4.0|In Brief<br />This is the true story of three of the members of the Stolen Generation.  Molly Craig, a young Aboriginal Girl played by Everlyn Sampi leads her younger sister and cousin in an escape from a government institution, set up as part of a policy to train Aboriginal children as domestic workers and integrate them into white society, where if they are suitable candidates some were chosen have their colour bred out.  Escaping this camp where ethnic cleansing has a far happier face on its front than the one that was in Europe at that time, she takes her companions on a journey of 1,500 miles.  An epic story that sees Molly one step ahead of the authorities at every turn, as she uses the rabbit proof fence that bisects the continent in this incredible journey home.  <br />Review<br />The strength of Rabbit Proof Fence comes through its ability to be both educational in its lessons of hidden history while at the same time reinforcing the human spirit and pathos that one can never loose hope under even the most extreme circumstances.  <BR>The mood of the film is conveyed perfectly through the performance given by Everlyn Sampi, who was discovered after a national talent search on the Australian channel nine.  Her simple gestures and the power held within her eyes, as she leads her sisters on a journey of extremes is both a testament to herself and director Phillip Noyce.  <br />Noyce, a veteran of hits such as Clear and Present Danger and The Bone Collector, has had a successful career \\"blowing stuff up in the sandpit that is Hollywood\\" as he put it, though he has never really become a household name outside of his domestic Australian homeland.  This month the unsung helmer brings us two films: accompanying this is The Quiet American.  Needless to say Fence has his heart while the other satisfies his pocket.  Fence is a personal horror story for all Australians that until now has gone untold.  It brings to life Doris Pilkington's original novel that tells the story of her mother's courageous journey home.  The fence, while having its practical uses in stopping the rabbit population from ravaging crops, acts as a metaphor to us all:  For Molly it was the umbilical cord that allowed her to find her mother and her home, while on a secondary level it is showing the rest of the world the way to the truth - and through its symbolic status after the films release has reunited members of the stolen generation.  <br />The most successful film in Australia last year, it has already been nominated for 10 AFI awards and depending upon its marketing in the States, deserves worldwide recognition.  If ever a child star deserved an Oscar then Everlyn Sampi is a top candidate in my mind.  The only major downside to this film is that it has an odd pace and does occasionally feel likes its natural tempo is disrupted in order to give the narrative a kick start it doesn't need.  Maybe too many years in Hollywood are responsible, but one can't help but feel that this is a director at odds with his own styles:  A question of how much gloss does one use before the reality can no longer breath springs to mind! <br />The Verdict<br />This is a beautiful film that is both mesmerising and finely acted.  If only it were slightly grittier, relying less on creating a point of view experience and had let the story speak for itself it would have been perfect.

The two Americans: one an ageing actor, the other a young wife find a common ground, filling a void that their respective relationships share. <br />Standout Scene:  It's an old joke, but Murray's bemusement is spot on, as sitting on the set of his latest Whiskey commercial, a torrent of foreign words pours from the Japanese director's mouth only for a less-than-able translator to pass on his wishes in a single word!<br />Any Good?  Once again, Sophia proves that by recent comparison she is a better director than Daddy Coppola.  While it gets stuck in its own story mid-way, the result is worth the attention.  A genuinely funny romance is rare on screen these days as Lost in Translation proves that true love CAN exist in friendship alone: CLASSIC!
B00006CXXU|5.0|There is only one word for this album...WOW. This is probablly the best album I have ever heard in my entire life. Christina Aguilera hides nothing in this album which makes it a must buy right there. Every single song is addictive and you can't get enough of her. The best song on this album is &quot;I'm Okay&quot; which is kind of a personal diary...i get chills listening to it. All in all...a very, very, VERY good album. Nothing can hold Christina down...you rule :)
B0000A36J5|5.0|In Brief<br />The second in the trilogy begins in the hills of Emyn Muil, where Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) discover they are being tracked by the mysterious Gollum (Serkis).  Elsewhere in Middle-Earth Aragorn (Mortensen), Legolas (Bloom), and Gimli (Rhys-Davis), encounter the besieged Rohan kingdom and its King who is under the spell of Saruman (Lee) &amp; the manipulations of his spy Wormtongue (Brad Dourif).  Gandalf (McKellen) has been reborn as Gandalf the White (that's not a spoiler - look he's on the poster) following his cataclysmic fight with the Balrog.  While hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) escape from the Uruk-hai and flee into the mysterious Fangorn Forest.  All this and the battle for Middle-Earth begins as the ring continues on its journey to Mordor.   <br />Review<br />Well its hard to believe but the second part is better than the first.  This is a truly beautiful film, the result of a group of people's love for a book that has taken so many to Middle-Earth from their bedrooms, commutes, or lives in general.  The second part takes us further into the story of the journey of the ring, the trials of the now broken fellowship, and the quest that lays ahead.  As the stories have split, there is more to get your teeth into than the first film as we crosscut from each of the groups and their latest encounters.  Where there were brief lags in The Fellowship of the Ring this narrative device allows Jackson to control the pacing at a far better level.  <br />While the aerial shots are numerous at times, they provide a simple way around the scale difference of the character's sizes as well giving us some beautiful imagery of the Middle-Earth landscape.  It is a place that its creators have made a believable realm - a place that IS there without question - where reality and fantasy collide into a unifying form that is real unto itself.  While some may question the following comparison, to me LOTR has the scope, majesty, spirit, action, and fantasy of any Kurosawa film, indeed if he were alive today I'd be hard pressed to say that it hadn't been made by the great man himself.  <br />The film works so well on various levels; the shear scope gave me many a chill, and the acting is beautifully woven into the tapestry that is this film.  There are some marvellously subtle moments; indeed the connection through the blue watery eyes of Gollum, Frodo and Wormtongue strikes interesting comparisons in the back of ones mind.  Here is a creature who has literally been torn in two by his addiction to the ring, there is Frodo who is finding the `weight' of his task is starting to affect his very being, while finally there is a man who has never touched the ring yet is affected by its power and is as twisted as the creature that has become Gollum.  Gollum, who possessed the ring prior to Bilbo, is one of the outstanding cast members of the film.  He is a CGI character whose voice and movements were captured from the performance of Andy Serkis, yet his work and the work of the artists who created the image we see upon the screen completely destroyed any prejudice I had against CGI characters as Gollum delivers a strong performance of internal conflict, deception, and is the full embodiment of Tolkien's slimy hissy being.  Finally, special mention must be given to Rhys-Davis' Gimil, a dwarf who is as fierce and as bold as he is comic and who acts as reminder that throughout the turmoil and destruction we witness there is always room for laughter.  <br />The Verdict<BR> <BR>A testament to the abilities of everyone involved that the unfilmable book has reached our screens, succeeding in every department that one may have had doubts in.  It is a beautifully complex film that neither patronises nor confuses it audience and though will not contain all the moments from the book every fan desires to see, it certainly has every essence of the spirit that is Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Regardless of her unability to posess her own artistic views...Britney Spears sound as real as a blow-up doll in her new album &quot;In The Zone&quot;. Despite it's non-catchy and quite annoying tunes and lyrics...Britney just flat out SUCKS with this new album...all I get from the entire album is that she is trying to prove she is better than Christina Aguilera (which she is not) and rise up to &quot;Dirrty&quot;. A word of advice everyone...if you want a good album buy &quot;Stripped&quot; not this &quot;In The Zone&quot; crap. I really expected better...she needs to stop letting the fame get to her head.
B00005JLXE|3.0|In Brief<br />Based on the Marvel Comics character created by Stan Lee and Bill Everett in 1964 Daredevil focuses upon a man blinded as a child in a freak chemical accident but whom some may say can see better than those with sight.  He dwells in a world of eternal darkness that is filled with scents, tastes, textures and sounds and his keen awareness allows him not be hampered by the fear that sight may induce.  By day, Matt Murdock represents the downtrodden from his shoestring law firm, while at night - haunted by the death of his father - he stalks the streets, relentless in his pursuit of justice where the guilty often find, there is hell to pay!<br />Review<br />Opening with a credit sequence that sees a CGI recreation of a Manhattan skyline at night swept through with ease by a free flying camera that discovers various nightlights that merge to form Braille print that subsequently morphs into the various names of Daredevil's stars, one is instantly given the theme of the movie.  Ben Affleck's portrayal of Daredevil sees him create a distinct variation on the shadow play and angst that generally drives the superhero desire to vanquish all evil.  This is a man who has learnt not to fear, bullied as a child he has overcome his physical weaknesses and learnt to use his inflicted blindness to his advantage.  Yet the death of his father haunts him and his search to discover the Kingpin's (Duncun) identity propels him to fight crime whatever the cost may be.  <br />While similarities can be seen between Tim Burton's original Batman, as we witness our crime fighter destroy both thugs and powerful villains alike, from the darkness of an alley to the airiness of a corporate environment such as a courtroom, there is something distinct in this reworking of the little know Stan Lee classic.  Indeed, I must admit to being surprised at the enjoyment I felt in watching Affleck and indeed the powerful Elektra (Garner) defeat a steady flow of bad guys.  Like Xmen, there isn'ta rush to thrown an audience into a comic they know nothing about as the story is built apace, with both intelligence and a believability that one generally is not accustomed to in such a film.  <br />Like John C. Reily and Steve Buscemi manage to steal their films with very little screentime so does another character actor, Joe Pantoliano, succeed as the hidden star of Daredevil.  Playing New York Post investigator Ben Urich, Pantoliano brings a credibility to this superhero fable that very few actors could have.  But his chance at the title for stealing the show is knocked clean out of the room by Colin Farrell's Bullseye: an Irish villain that never misses.  It may be surprising that a character with a target tattooed on his head does so well to both entertain and create a believable threat to the hero of the piece but then again anyone that flicks a peanut into an elderly lady's mouth to shut her up on his long haul flight has got to be evil enough to possibly defeat Daredevil, even if he is flying economy class!  <br />The Verdict<br />While it did have one continuity error of note involving a clock on a subway platform, Daredevil is a competent action movie that relies more on old-school storytelling rather than OTT CGI.  Besides any film the cameos Kevin Smith has got to be worth your time.  The bottom line is that Daredevil doesn't patronise and is satisfyingly entertaining without pandering to the merchandise friendly 12A kids market it instead opts to tell a dark tale that will excite and thrill, just try to forget that Affleck is dressed in red leather.
068983571X|4.0|Reviewing a Sherlock Holmes story is like reviewing a Big Mac -- there's little point in recommending it one way or the other because you're already familiar with its ilk and you find it either delightful or a noxious, cholesterol-laden, artery-clogging, quasi-edible hockey puck.  A little Sherlock Holmes goes a long way, but \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" Doyle's only full-length (although short) novel featuring the sleuth, flows at a nice pace that proportions it well with the shorter stories.<br />The case involves the legend of a monstrous hound that haunts the moor around Baskerville Hall, the ancestral manor of the nearly defunct Baskerville line.  Sir Henry Baskerville has just returned to England from Canada to inherit the estate left by his uncle Sir Charles who recently died under mysterious circumstances that appear to be related to the hound.  In London, Sir Henry has received an anonymous note warning him to stay away from the moor, someone has been shadowing him, and, even more portentously, two boots have been stolen from his hotel room -- not a pair, but one boot from each of two pairs.<br />Immediately hired to solve the puzzle, Holmes dispatches his loyal colleague, Dr. Watson, to Baskerville Hall to collect clues.  Watson meets several interesting residents in the vicinity, such as Stapleton, a wispy entomologist living in a house with his sister whose beauty attracts Sir Henry's amorous attentions, and Frankland, an ebulliently litigious old man with a telescope and a troubled daughter.  Among the servants of Baskerville Hall, the most prominent is Barrymore the butler who, for the sake of his wife, is harboring an incriminating secret about someone or something lurking on the moor.<br />Doyle is quite effective at evoking the bleakness of the moor, the slipping and drowning hazards of its slopes and bogs, and the chilling reverberations of the ghostly nocturnal canine howl across the open spaces.  The dark aura of the setting is magnified by the folkloric evil of Hugo Baskerville, the ancestor whose sins are purported to have brought the curse of the hound upon his descendants.  Holmes, of course, is no believer in superstitions; he puts his faith in physical logic and meticulously analyzes every detail observable to nobody but himself until an answer suggests itself.  Watson, as the emotional, compassionate half of the duo, complements the stoic Holmes; his main function is not to be a detective but to tell the story, which is fine because Holmes himself would probably be an insufferably mechanical narrator.the folkloric evil of Hugo Baskerville, the ancestor whose sins are purported to have brought the curse of the hound upon his descendants.

0887308589|5.0|I've worked as an engineer or technician, both for big companies and small.  Before Dilbert, in all but the most restrictive environments, a small office underground poked the same kind of fun at management.  Some offices even have their own cartoonists.  A mega-sized company in Texas had a talented, cartoon artist, who did satirical office cartoons, with great caricature likenesses.  He signed his work \\"The Phantom\\", and because I think even management knew who he was, he stayed restrained enough to keep it funny, but not too insulting.  One possible exception, was a cartoon that mimicked the classic road gang movie, \\"Cool Hand Luke\\".  He depicted an office corridor which as management walked by each office, they would say \\"Still shaking that work order there, boss\\". It did not go over too well with management.<br />The Dilbert Principle is loosely based on the long discussed phenomena, called the \\"Peter Principle\\".  Which I always thought means the biggest \\"prick\\" rises the highest. Usually it's the most unqualified as well.  In this age we pay CEO's millions in salary, and then give them massive stock options. In return, they bankrupt the company with shady accounting practices, and sometimes, outright theft. You have to wonder if the term \\"business ethics\\" is an oxymoron. It's good that most offices have people like Dilbert, and we all have artists like Scott Adams.  The humor allows many of us to survive the droll, office existence day after day. The unrewarding existence, of working in a system where incompetents profit, often on our good works.<br />Prior to Dilbert, I may have considered myself unique, or just unlucky to be employed by some of these bozo's in suit and tie.  I've been through the improvement meetings, sensitivity, and those focus groups.  The \\"one on one\\" carpet sessions with my boss, which accomplished nothing, except to try my patience, and then waste my time. Still, management needs to feel they do something, and if it can't make a new report to show their own boss this week, it may be time to try out the latest management fad.  Adams collection of cartoons, groups these into common categories of management tactics.  If you look hard enough, you may even find a cartoon, that help you avoid experiencing the same Hell in your own office.  It's too bad the managers don't seem to read these books, or if they do, they don't seem to be telling.<br />Perhaps the most important thing found in The Dilbert Principle, is that it gives some of us a better understanding of what's really going on.  Unless you're fairly astute, you will occasionally find yourself buying into a lot of management disinformation.  Information, that could clue you into a \\"downsizing\\", a company sale, management change, or other \\"issues\\", that may give you reason to brush up the old resume.  At the very least, if gives you a chance to know what's probably going on behind the scenes, and decide how to best keep your own house.<br />Another thing that is uncanny about Scott Adams, is his depiction of the characters.  It seemed like, the company I worked for in Texas, was chock full of those little balding management guys. Middle managers with overly short wide ties, and always carrying a cup of coffee in their right hand, as they walked about.   They'd ask us about what we were doing, and when we told them they'd look confused, say something cleverly non-committal, and move on.  It used to be a competition to see who could confuse them first, and move them on to the next persons office or cubicle.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|This is one of the best movies of 2003 by far. I'm not a huge Jack Nicholson fan but I do love Diane Keaton, they are both amazing in this film. It's a great story, extremely well done. Amanda Peet does a great job playing her part up against some very strong actors including Frances McDormand. The low point of this movie is Keanu Reaves, he's just ok but he tries to make in work in a role that is a bit \\"lost\\" among such HUGE characters. Go see this movie and tell everyone you know.

0517189542|5.0|My mom bought me the book, Little Women, quite a few years ago. I'm a book worm and proud to admit it, but I didn't get around to reading this classic novel until a few weeks ago. I'm not sure why I put it off for so long, but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. This a beautiful and rich tale that takes us to the past, where a whole different world awaits to be explored. Little Women is a must read! <br />Little Women is the perfect story for the truly romantic person. Not just romance in the sense of love, but in the classical sense. Something being historical, timely, and good hearted. Little Women is full of the virtue and lessons that we try to find in our daily life. At the end, the reader is engulfed in happiness and satisfaction. Though not a deep, philosophical work, it provides its own morals, brought out in a way that can be enjoyed from generation to generation. <br />The story centers around the lives of the 4 March sisters: Jo (Josephine), Meg (Margaret), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy. Each sister possesses a unique personality with their mother as their link and loving companion. In the early part of this Louisa May Alcott novel, Mr. March is away at war and his daughters show concern for his welfare. It is said that Alcott didn't know what to do with the father's character so she wrote him as being gone to war. A genius solution to a literary block! Anyway, the story centers around the trials and tribulations of each girl and the family, as a whole. The family is poor, but still live to do good...or try to be good at least. Though it seems unrealistic that the family should be in bliss even in poverty, Alcott brings the fantasy level to ground level by portraying the girls as being a little selfish. With all the beautiful clothes and delicate manners, who could blame them for getting carried away with vanity. However, we also experience what lessons the girls have learned and appreciate their honesty. The family is not always going through pleasant situations, but take a share in heartache and loss, as every family does. <br />In a time when modesty is not exactly a trend, Little Women sets a bar all on its own. It will warm your heart, even if you've already read the novel four hundred times. So, take some time out of your day to read the exhilarating trials of the \\"Little Women\\".

B000002AZ8|4.0|Your either gonna love it or hate it.  It's that simple.  If you are coming to this album expecting the sounds of ten, vs., or no code, walk away now. that being said it is definetlety a great album.  The album is bogged down by less than stellar songs(pry to, last exit) and weird arrangements that are novel upon first play, but simpley filler to help buff the album up to lp status (bugs, foxymophandlemommathatsme, etc.) but despite these faults it still manages to shine through all the tarnish on it's name. spin the black circle is a decent opener along the likes of vs.' &quot;go&quot;.  Not for you is certainly a great song, it is one of the few on the album that makes you want to scream along with it.  nothingman is a great song, also, certainly one of their best acoustic numbers. it's deeper, and more sorrow ridden than say, &quot;elderly woman...&quot; from vs.  whipping is another pearljam classic off this album, it seems like a more contorllable version of not for you, but it doesn't sound anything like it melody wise, so don't worry about that.  among the next few tracks is some filler, good filler, maybe even great compared to other bands, but not up to 'Jam snuff.  corduroy and immortality do manage to break through the lesser material.  they're fine songs that you'll proablly always find yourself listening to. the album has one great song left unmentioned. it is possibley the best song they ever did and will do.  Betterman, it was the albums standout song and biggest radio hit. this song alone makes the album worth its money. in comclusion of this review, I remind you there are a few bad tracks and less than great songs, but to battle it out are some of the best songs that Pearl Jam have ever done.  It deserves four stars, and was even on the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list that Rollingstone compiled.  Buy it and love it.
B00005JM9C|5.0|Despite the bad reviews, I think this movie was wonderful. Sure, it lacks in the originality department but this movie has what most of the films today don't-heart. Call me cheesy but it's true. It's a feel-good movie. When you watch it, don't expect a complex plot and hardcore acting. It's a fun movie. In the end, it does make you want to dance.
B00006M183|3.0|this album is Pearl Jam's best in years.  yield and no code were fine, but this is easily the best album they've done since Vitalogy. Now, having said that, it is only a three star album. Despite this average rating, this is possibly Pearl Jam's most consistently enjoyable album. it has its weak spots (greendisease, cropduster,get right) but it has more songs that are memorable than any other 'Jam album. Saying that I must also say that it does not have a song like Betterman or daughter to make it a big hit.  none of these songs are as great as Pearl jams greatest, but this album is an album full of songs that would be desired out of a good essential double disk greatest hits album for Pearl Jam. The songs you will likely love off this record and remember to listen to each time you pull out this album are as follows: Can't keep, the opener and one of the albums better tracks; love boat captain, a slow mellow song that is easily loveable; I am mine, along with can't keep, one of the albums very best; thumbing my way,  a beutiful love song; you are, one of my personal favorites off the album, it is dark like vitalogy's &quot;not for you&quot; but more relaxed; help help, a sweet song with a catchy harmonized melody that asks for (duh) help; bushleaguer, which despite its political ranting is decent; and finally the albums closer, all or none, one of the slowest and weariest songs of Pearl Jam's career, it is still very good.  Once again, there is no just genius track, but to make up for it, there is about ten great songs to love.  I must note, just so you know, that the album has a laid back, almost exhausted sound that, while different from the pearl jam style, works and is welcome. Don't be fooled by my rating, this is a great album, and if it had say &quot;daughter&quot; on it, I would have given four and a half to five stars to it, but that simple lacking element holds this great album back, and is why, even though they've truly made a comeback here on this album,without the key track, they didn't get much attention.  Anyways, buy this album, and enjoy it.
1573226521|2.0|It wasn't a bad book, really, but it didn't do much for me. I found myself thinking 'Lord of the Flies' the entire time I was reading about young Richard and his exploits. If this book is in your 'Maybe Read' pile, I'd say just watch the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio. The scenery there is awesome and more relationships develop on screen than in the book. Most of the movie follows the book in lockstep. There is some crazy violence in the book that didn't make it to the big screen, however.<br />You never know - you might like it. For me, though, it was a fairly unmemorable book.

0345347951|3.0|This book probably makes many people uncomfortable. There are a number of thoughts present that openly challenge religion, nationality and the sense of superiority that humanity possesses at times. Ultimately, the clever way in which these concepts were interwoven made for a good story. After reading this book, I realized that Darwinism is much, much more than a scientific theory for some. It is a worldview...and I will always remember this book as an example of that.    The problem that hinders this text is the same as many of those stories that span across several generations. A constant influx of characters are introduced to the reader, and being this book is only ~230 pages, we can only briefly meet them. This prevents us from forming deep emotional bonds with the characters. These men and women are really only window dressing to the sweeping changes that are encompassing mankind.    I would recommend this book to those that enjoy looking at things from new and different perspectives, although these same perspectives are often deeply flawed and arrogant when you think about it. If you desire to learn more about human nature, Clarke's thoughts cover a wide range of human wants and emotions, leaving the reader with ideas wonderous, sobering, fulfilling and bittersweet. But perhaps, fiction is where Darwinism should stay.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Absolutely enchanting...all the way through. Not one weak track. Ms. Brightman again proves she is one of the most romantic interpreters of sound and lyrics on earth.
B00006690G|5.0|This is a great CD (if you disregard Drips and White America)<br />Till I Collapse is possibly the best rap song ever because you can listen to it over and over without getting bored of it and I'm surprised it hasn't hit the charts yet. When the Music Stops is good too and I'd recommend buying the CD just for those two songs!
B00005JMGC|3.0|I've just seen this movie last night and I've been moved to ponder over some of the more thought-provoking scenes for the whole of today.<br />Julia Roberts, soon-to-be timeless Hollywood actress, never ceases to charm with her infectious smile and occasional girlish giggles a la Pretty Woman. The ensemble of up and rising young actresses however, do not get much screen time to fully explore and develop their characters. Nevertheless, this is quite a charming story.<br />Superficially, Mona Lisa may have mirrored the much more inspiring and heart-wrenching tragedy of Dead Poets but Roberts' character is portrayed as being more self-serving. Catherine Watson, 1st year Art history teacher, came to Wellesley for the sole purpose of achieving her own purpose to make a difference and liberate the girls who are actually scared of their independence. Although her actions seem to stem from altruism, Dominic West's character rightly hits the nail on the head with the brutal truth - that Watson is really in Wellesley to see other people lead the life she really wants but never had.<br />Choice was featured prominently in Watson's exchanges with Joan (played by Julia Stiles from 10 Things I Hate About You). Furthering one's studies and proving that a new age woman can still manage her family is Watson's ideal and Joan chooses rightly so to pursue her own ideal goal of family life instead. Ironically, Joan was the one who epitomised the ideal modern woman that Watson was fighting for - A woman who has the insight into what she really wants and what she does not and who has no regrets about her decisions about what she wants to do with her life. Joan is truly the non-conformist in this movie, refusing to conform to the traditional rituals of huge weddings, the expectations of a true-blue American wife and more importantly, Watson's expectations of a true-blue American modern woman.<br />The other characters were sadly not given the opportunity to reflect the various gender issues and socio-political dimensions of the era other than the overused cliches of long-suffering wife with cheating husband, on-off-on-off and then on again relationships due to miscommunication (although the Men from Mars and Women from Venus pun was rather witty) and finally the self-destructing \\"New York Kite\\".<br />Overall a charming movie saved not by Mona Lisa's Smile but Julia Roberts'.<br />Take care of you
B00005JL95|5.0|The critics rated this movie well and it deserves it. It is a truly entertaining movie that can be watch by anyone and still be thoroughly enjoyed. It also teaches good morals to little kids, if you care about that sort of thing. One thing that supports it, and you'll notice it, is all the little humourous quirks they fit throughout the movie, ie: the character Pleakley has two toungues, the weird language Stitch uses and Lilo's facination with Elvis.<br />It's a 5 star kids movie and it's worth buying if you have any kids at all!
0385504209|3.0|I borrowed this from my mother who was reading it for her book club and finished it in a day and a half. Overall, it is a great plot, fast paced and exciting. The background he gives on the other view of the Holy Grail is interesting, as I've never heard about that theory before. I'm Catholic and I heard that the church was upset about this book, but truthfully, it really isn't that bad or much different than a movie like &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, which offers different views on  religious characters that may offend some people.<br />I kind of wish they would have explained more about the differences between the two Marys (Jesus's mother and Magdalene) and their roles in the church, how the mother of God was elevated to such high status in the Catholic church, especially. I think readers who are not Catholic and not aware of the strong Marian culture within the church that would find it interesting...it was kind of stressed how the church was patriarchal, male-dominated (still true in many instances) and didn't really recognize women too much.<br />The intricate system of riddles the two main characters must solve are really well done and entertaining. I found the ending to be too cliqued (reunited with lost family and the two main characters ending up together) and it kind of ruined my overall review of the book. I would recommend it, but the ending could have been done better I think.
B0000DZ3HM|3.0|I have had the two laser disk version of this show for a long time and this version is not only missing several excellent Charles Lloyd Quartet performance but has, in some insane effort to include the audience substituted some decidedly inferior angles to change the original footage. As such its a big disappointment. Frankly, I think the laser disk version is clearly superior. The few extra added cuts are nice but the missed footage is inexcusable.
1558908382|4.0|John Cusack rarely makes bad films, and he can be highly original when left to his own devices (as here). Cusack has managed to maintain a hip/cool image even as he has grown from teen heart throb (&quot;Say Anything&quot;) to an actor now in his thirties. <br />Cusack plays a very neurotic hitman who has tired of the hitman game. After a stint in the military, he found he had a very unique talent: he is very good at killing people. He's made a very good living, but he is tired of the pressures of his profession (apparently there is a lot of competition in the hit man industry). He tries to sort his life out with a very reluctant therapist (the hilarious Alan Arkin) and decides to attend his high school reunion. Naturally, a hit man can't return to his high school reunion with out some kind of high jinks ensuing. <br />This movie is wildly original and funny, sometimes over the top, but always entertaining. My only real problem with it, there just did not seem to be a lot of chemistry between Minnie Driver and Cusack. In fact, she almost seems disinterested in her part from time-to-time. Still, this is worth viewing again and again. And everyone I lend it to loves it.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I've already written about this album and this band to my friends and family but after reading some of the reviews on this site I felt compelled to put my two cents in.  <br />Basically, when I read the negative reviews of the Strokes (and there are way too many) I am convinced that you all aren't actually listening to the music.  Why?  Because your arguments really aren't consistent with what I'm hearing.  As far as I'm concerned it's just as trendy to bash the Strokes as it is to BE them.  <br />Anyone with half an ear for good music should be able to listen to ROOM ON FIRE and hear that it is a marked improvement over IS THIS IT.  Are they formulaic?  Sure but it's their OWN forumula that they're working.  That's not laziness, people, that's focus.  God forbid a rock band try to go out and try to establish its own identity.  Don't give me that Velvet Underground/Television crap.  The only thing the Strokes stole from them was the ability to make great songs on a consistent basis.<br />Name one band in the world that would have the cajones to even attempt a Sam Cooke-style soul ballad like the brilliant \\"Under Control.\\"  The Strokes do it and do it quite well.  The strength of the band lies in Julian Casablancas very underrated voice and even more underrated songwriting.  Very few artists today can write lyrics with as much biting wit.<br />The best-written track on here is also probably the shortest (I'll get to the length thing later) the album's closer \\"I Can't Win\\".  The second verse alone should be examined in poetry classes on college campuses across the map.  It maintains a perfect balance of tragedy and comedy that is rarely, if ever, found in modern songwriting.  Only OutKast's \\"Unhappy\\" from Big Boi's SPEAKERBOXXX is better at jerking the tears while tickling the funny bone.  <br />It's all about a man who doesn't have a whole lot going for him trying desperately to find the bright spots in some of the most humiliating conditions.  It's like when you wake up in the morning next to the ugliest girl from the bar but then realize that not only was it the best sex you've had in a while but it was the ONLY sex you've had in a while.  The song's all about having no money but then scrounging up just enough to buy a slice of the best pizza in the city.  That individual moment is not only what the song is about but it's about what the Strokes' music is about.  SPIN magazine put it best, the Strokes are the band you listen to when you have just enough money to go out that NIGHT, so that's what you do.<br />For a lot of us, those great moments come few and far between and when they do they don't last that long.  But for the time that they're happening, those moments are golden.  The Strokes take those moments, freeze 'em, cut out the details and leave ONLY the good parts.  The Strokes' music is so short because it consists of nothing but those good parts.  <br />The Strokes kinda remind of Miller High Life.  It may be cheap but there's something undeniably charming about it.
B00003CY6M|3.0|This film gets three stars based on the actors in it and the fact that if you don't try to look to deep into it it is reasonably entertaining. But, ultimately, this is a very average film. Cusack and Beckinsale have both done far better work and no doubt will do better work in the future.<br />Kate Beckinsale's charater is big believer in fate, so when she and Cusack meet briefly and they seem perfect for one another, rather than continuing to explore a relationship, she leaves her number in a book and challenges him to find it. Naturally, he loses track of the book and, consequently, Kate. Several years later, he is on the verge of marrying someone else but wants to take one more shot at finding Beckinsale. Jeremy Pevin, a very underrated actor, aids him in his endeavor.  Naturally, it all ends happily.<br />Unfortunately, the setup of the film is so overly contrived that you just find yourself asking, &quot;couldn't somewhat have come up with a better storyline?&quot; The film is saved by winning performances, but it remains an average, run-of-the-mill romance, at best. Even my wife, who usually loves this kind of film, was unimpressed.
B00008DDXC|4.0|When I left the first movie after seeing it, I couldn't remember hardly anything that had happened in it only a couple of hours later.  It was all special effects and the guy who played Harry Potter grinning irritatingly at everything he saw.  But I think the second film was a huge improvement.  It grabbed and kept my attention.<br />I'm sad that Richard Harris died after filming on this one was finished.  He was good as Dumbledore.  Michael Gambon will be good.  I just read that Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) will be playing Voldemort.  Now that is strange.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|There are many great things that I can say about this film, but I will keep it short.  This is the most overall enjoyable film I have seen in years and maybe ever.  A subtle smile appeared on my face from the first shot (not just because of the pink panties....) and steadily grew as I watched Bob and Charlotte's equally subtle relationship blossom.  Sometimes less is more, and the sparse dialogue and restrained performances allow this picture to resonate with powerful emotion.  Through facial expressions (most notably Bill Murray's eyes) and patches of lonely silence, the two leads become a part of the viewer and we lose ourselves in their kindred souls.  <br />   This reinvention of Murray (which started in Rushmore, was polished in The Royal Tenenbaums and will be furthered in The Life Aquatic.  Thank you Wes Anderson) is a marvel to watch and through Lost in Translation is worthy of the Best Actor Oscar.  Scarlett Johansson, though here in a lead role, should be marketed as a Best Supporting Actress and is the best candidate in that field.  She has been great since The Horse Whisperer, was excellent in Ghost World and is a double threat this year along with her performance in Girl With The Pearl Earring.  And what of Sofia Coppola?  She will receive three nominations come the end of this month.  The first for Best Picture as one of the film's producers, another for Best Director, and one more for Best Original Screenplay (which she deserves to win).  The script is smart enough that the characters don't cheapen their relationship by making it \\"Hollywood\\" and sleeping together (a choice rarely seen in contemporary films).<br />   I do have one question: Would this film have succeeded the way it does if another actor played the role of Bob?  I'm still not sure, but luckily we'll never have to find out.  Bill Murray has graced this picture with an almost indescibable quality and has aided in creating (along with the talented cast and crew) a memorable film which belongs on the \\"Classics\\" shelf.
B000002BQK|5.0|After sitting here trying to come up with a professional, journalistic way of saying this I realise it's as simple as this... THIS IS MARIAH'S BEST ALBUM!<br />Mariah is well known for her amazing, powerful, can be annoying (NOT in my opinion) voice. The vocals are still strong on this album but I don't think I have ever come across an album that is as clever in style or concept. Beginning with <br />HONEY, the infectious first single, Mariah pulls in Puffy for production and after the success of FANTASY foes not disappoint as this debuts at #1 on Billboard Hot 100 and becomes her 12th #1 single. <br />The beautiful ballad that is BUTTERFLY could possibly be the best track with the bridge being the main thrill. The other song which contends for the best track is what follows... <br />MY ALL. This is a desperate cry for a reconciliation even if it only short-lived. <br />THE ROOF sets a mood that no other Mariah song has done and to me, the piano intro says it all. Those Mariah fans will know what I mean. <br />FOURTH OF JULY is probably the only track that is not imbued with sorrow as she gently recalls a breathtaking night. <br />BREAKDOWN is very melodic and has been hailed (by Mariah) as an almost follow-up to ALWAYS BE MY BABY. An emotional song describing the way in which we hide our feelings \\"...so I wear a disguise...\\" <br />BABYDOLL is a song that I would label \\"delicious\\". Very sexy vocals with lyrics co-written by Missy Elliot. <br />CLOSE MY EYES heightens the depressive tone of this album with lyrics like \\"...maybe I grew up a little too soon...\\" <br />WHENEVER YOU CALL is another beautiful track and although it is done gorgeous(ly) solo, I happen to prefer the version with Brian McKnight on #1's. Probably because he has the most gorgeous male vocal I have ever heard. <br />FLY AWAY (BUTTERFLY REPRISE) - I read somewhere that Mariah originally wrote BUTTEFLY as a dance track and only later turned it into a ballad. For that reason alone we can excuse thistrack and accept it for what it is.<br />THE BEAUTIFUL ONES - Mariah has never done a \\"bad\\" cover and this simply proves that. With DRU HILL on vocals it is up there with the best on the album. I used to believe it was drawn out at 7 minutes but when I listen to it now, I'm too busy soaking up the pain that I don't notice.<br />OUTSIDE - Perhaps \\"TBO\\" would have been the perfect ending to this extremely poignant album?! However I do love this track and I remember crying (very unlike me) the first time I heard this song. Very typical MC.<br />In conclusion, this is a must have for EVERYONE, not just for Mariah fans. She is still my favourite to this day and I will continue to support her but if she records albums for the next 100 years, I strongly doubt she will ever come near this.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|After watching the western movie titled: \\"Unforgiven\\", it reminded me of a trip my brother and I made out to Nevada, to a place called Pioche. During the late 1800's, They say Pioche was one of the most ruthless towns in the West. It was a busy mining town and a war zone. If you visited, you ran the chance of being harassed or even killed. Murder wasn't uncommon in Pioche, Nevada. It was also common in many other colonial frontier settlements at the time. In my opinion, this was the true history of America's expansion into the West while drunk in corruption. The movie Unforgiven, will satisfy this assumption; It will testify about everything. There's no Hollywood glamour, or fake stereotypes in this movie. You will see things up close and personal. You will see the disease that plagued the territory. This often must have been the true lifestyle during America's westward expansion; or the prime of it's Manifest Destiny.<br />This movie is directed by Clint Eastwood, and he's also the main character. Unforgiven is highly disturbing, and hard to understand.

0553582453|5.0|The main reason I love this series is because of it's complicated political plot.  It really makes you think about what's going on.  I like the way the characters are all flawed; none of them is perfect,not even close.  The biggest problem with this book and the first one is that a lot of text is used to describe not much happening, but you only notice that at the end.  And when you get down to it, who cares?  It's really gripping and if nothing much happens, so what? the third book certainly makes up for it with twice as much happening as in the first 2 books combined.  The good thing is, it doesn't even seem rushed.<br />This book opens some intriguing questions, mainly about Elliania and Peottre.  What is that tattoo, for example?  Where is Elliania's mother?  Who are the rain wild traders and this dragon which seems to be popping up everywhere?  (If you want to know more about Tintaglia and the rain wilders, read the liveship traders series.  I wouldn't reccomend it as much - it's a bit slow to start).<br />The Outislanders and their customs is a refreshing break from the Six Duchies culture, which I find is a typical fantasy setting somewhat resembling the middle ages.  I like the way the women are in charge, but it still has the traditional, and irritating, belief that women should stay home to look after the home.  <br />Not for the first time, we are shown Fitz's relationship problems in very close detail.  I understand his trouble with his bastard daughter, Nettle (who doesn't know she is his daughter) but I wish he would do something about it.  Also, he never even seems to attempt to copy Nettle's dream making talent, simply submitting to his terrifying and traumatic nightmares without putting up a fight.<BR>I feel for him with his troubles with Hap.  Isn't that every father's worry?  And didn't he do the same when he was young?  But the episode with Jinna is frankly embarrassing. (get a life, Fitz!)<BR>I hated it when Fitz and the Fool had that fight.  Hobb is really good at helping you see from Fitz's point of view; it's like you're right inside his head.  But when the Fool explains his reasoning, I felt that that was perfectly reasonable too.  Alas, Fitz, you do have a problem with your relationships, don't you?<BR>And last, but not least, why didn't Fitz go and see Burrich?  It's the one of two things in the entire series that I just think 'No, that's not what he would have done'.<br />It's a great book.  Everyone, read it.  It's definitely worth it and doesn't succumb to any of the usual problems with Fantasy.

B00005JLYW|1.0|This was sickening and incredibly stupid. Hollywood has dumbed down today's movie audience if people actually thinks this is a good movie. I've seen heart surgeries more entertaining than this crud. I could set up a hamster and a rat and they could write and direct something better than this. This is a big waste of money. If you got roped into seeing this on DVD like I did come join me at the \\" Avoid Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle \\" support group. If you've never seen it, get away as fast as you can before this film makes you another one of these \\" pods \\" that believe this was a good film when it was pure s---. I don't know who could call this a film. It wasn't even a movie. This could have been done in five minutes. Diaz is a sweet woman but she cannot carry this film. Drew Barrymore was dead weight. Lucy Liu was unnoticable. At first I was upset there were no black chicks in it, but after I watched it I was damn happy there wasn't! It's bad enough Bernie Mac got so money hungry he agreed to be in this.  I feel sorry for the world if all movies continue to be as idotic and as mind-draining as this.  They could have at least had pretty women with some great bodies ( unlike these flat bones ) . The trailers tried to hype this film by saying the women were so good looking. Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu are shaped like men. I could accept that if the studio hadn't used their supposed great bodies to pull in this film.  I could understand if they had actresses like J-Lo or Halle Berry that have curves. Who would you rather see in a thong? J-Lo or Lucy Liu? Case closed. I wouldn't have mentioned the looks thing but it was so pathetic that the studio knew this film sucked so they picked out the bikini picks for the trailers to get men's tongues wagging so they'd waste $8 on this mess. What has happened to true quality of films? Instead we see boney sticks and a tacky Drew Barrymore struggling over lines. Demi Moore wasn't even pretty anymore.  She looked like the female Marilyn Manson. I'd rather have butt surgery than see this again. I'd rather have a migraine. At least after that's over I feel better. After watching this I felt worse. Utter garbage. Save yourself.lyn Manson. I'd rather have butt surgery than see this again. I'd rather have a migraine. At least after that's over I feel better. After watching this I felt worse.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|This Cd is worth every penny I paid for it. Some of these one-star reviews can be very misleading. I actually bought Nelly Furtado's 'Folklore after some people said it was better than 'In the Zone'. I hope I can sell it off e-bay or something. <BR>In the Zone is a dancy fun CD and to whoever keeps saying Stripped and Justified are better (Stop advertising here), it's a CD to have fun with. Not all lyrics have got to be about life and stuff. <BR>It's got amazing beats and catchy tunes. I love all the songs except Early Mornin' and I hope Britney never works with Moby again. And not all the songs are sex-related and about clubbing like someone wrote. There's Toxic which is about getting addicted to the wrong type of people, Shadow which is great ballad about the unreal presence of her lover, Brave new girl which is about coming out of her shell and Everytime which is her sorry to her ex. There's pretty big variety in this CD. All songs totally different from each other and her old stuff. This CD should be given a chance. If you don't like it the first time you listen to it, give it a couple more listens. There are a very CDs few that you'll like the first time you listen to it. This CD is something you get slowly addicted to unlike her previous CDs which you liked at the first go.  <BR>And to whoever said that Christina Aguilera should've sung Everytime, go get a life! She would've shouted her head off and spoilt the song. I'm not saying she's not a good singer but this song suits Britney with the sweet piano tunes in the background not Christina! And god knows whether Christina would've come up with such an excellent tune on her own. <BR>And about Britney's marriage, go to some forum and discuss about it. This is a review column for Pete's sake!
0312263120|1.0|There are just too many mistakes in this book, that the author even made things up against historical facts. <br />Computer technology stuff aside, I have to point out another major mistake the author made:<br />In the novel, at the end, it took the scientists way too long time to figure out that the unlock key is the element mass difference between Urinum 235 and Urinum 238, because the author claimed that both atomic bomb dropped in Japan in 1945 were Urinium bombs.<br />However, the fact is, only the bomb dropped in Hiroshima was Urinium Bomb (on August 6, 1945); The other bomb dropped on August 9, 1945 in Nagasaki, was instead a more advanced Plutunium bomb! Not Urinium bomb at all. This can be easily double checked or verified by simply asking a high school student!<br />I think the book is rushed out to cash in on the author's fame on DVC book, and it indeed showed us how sloppy the process is.
0140177396|5.0|It took me 27 years to read &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; and when I finally did, I realized what I had been missing for all of that time. This is easily the perfect novel. The pace is brisk, the flow sound, and the characters real. There are no loose ends in this text -- it is tied together as tightly as the bags of barley that the men buck in the fields -- and it poses such universal questions as: &quot;What is justice?&quot; &quot;What is friendship?&quot;  This novel is not long, but it is one that you will think about long after you have finished reading it.
B0000DZTIW|3.0|Zimmer cranks 'em out. Many of them competent, a share uninspired and technical.  Granted he's come a long way since &quot;Burning Secret&quot; and the noise of &quot;Point of No Return&quot;.  Guess it was good Stanley Myers gave him a start, and Zimmer has made gazillions more than poor old talented Stanley ever saw.  This score is lovingly recorded, AND its quite derivative of &quot;Last Emperor&quot; and&quot;Little Buddha&quot; by Ryuchi Sakamoto, but any Hollywood approach to ancient Japanese culture is going to sound similar, perhaps.<br />A lovely main theme. The ususal repetitive, martial build ups lushly recorded a la Crimson Tide.  Alas, The Morricone Syndrome. Too many scores in one year.... it all starts to sound similar. Guess it's nice to younger ears who haven't heard many scores prior to 1990. Doesn't make it any less pleasant or well-executed.

A friend kept looking over to ask, &quot;Can we leave yet?&quot;<br />I said, &quot;Maybe they'll play that Michael McDonald song again since they've already played it a couple of times.&quot;<br />That thin hope, as well as a grim determination to see if any frame to this clueless mess could result in &quot;entertainment,&quot; kept me there.  No luck.<br />I went looking for the theatre manager to demand my money back, but could only find teenagers cleaning up popcorn in other theatres (it was after midnight and management had split).<br />Leaving me in Las Vegas to try and salvage that night.<br />I hated this movie.

6302787068|4.0|This is one of the better of the new breed of Disney cartoons.  A good story, good characters (Jafar is a great villian) and voices.  I would have rated this higher except that at times Robin Williams (as the Genie) talks to fast and overblows his role.  As far as kids go, my kids like this one but not as much as The Lion King and Toy Story which they have seen hundreds of times.  I would say that they watched Aladdin less than a handful of times.
B00005JM0B|4.0|No one really thought Terminator 3 would be made. Sure, the title &quot;Rise of the Machines&quot; has been tossed around since at least 1997, but with Cameron's near-perfect T2 and the franchise being more than a decade old, most fans didn't give any serious consideration to a third installment. But someone decided to go ahead and make T3 anyway.<br />I went into T3 with low expectations. All the comments I'd heard on the movie pinned it as average to slightly above-average at best. The director was so-so, the running time was way under T2, only Arnold chose to return, and the box office reciepts weren't that great. And sure enough most of the movie matched those expectations. Fun action, but a lot of re-hashing of what had been done in the first two movies. Minimal character development, just enough to make the viewer give a damn about the heroes. Competent direction, but everything seemed to operate on such a small scale, considering that this was supposed to be the last hours before judgement day.<br />So far, the movie was a decent popcorn flick that was worth my money and thankfully didn't manage to embarass the legacy of the movies before it.<br />Then the final few minutes of the movie rolled, and everything changed. I don't know how I managed to not spoil the ending for myself, considering all the reviews I read, but I was totally blown away. Yeah, I heard they were leaving room for a Terminator 4, but I didn't expect it to happen this way. Suddenly, the small scale of the movie seems to make sense, as if it's all clever misdirection of some sort. T3 could've worked a lot better with a more stylistic director and a slightly longer running time, but as it stands, its ending makes it a more-than-worthy entry in the franchise. Before, I dreaded another installment. Now, I'm looking forward to it.<br />WB's treatment of T3 on DVD is something of a disappointment. Audio/visual is very good, and thankfully the movie comes in a keepcase instead of a snapper, but the supplements are just there to take up space. There's a good deleted scene that must be watched by all fans, and a few decent featurettes, but most of the bonus material is promotional in nature. Given how loaded the past Terminator discs have been, T3 simply doesn't compare.<br />T3 is a great popcorn movie with a jaw-dropping ending. WB needs to learn how to make a decent 2-disc special edition of its summer movies. 4 stars.the supplements are just there to take up space.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Now that 2003 has come to a close, I'm looking back on all of the CD's that came out (there sure were a lot) and the one that sticks out prominently in my mind and affected me the most is definitely A Perfect Circle's &quot;Thirteenth Step.&quot; Together with new-comers James Iha (formerly of Smashing Pumpkins, replacing Danny Lohner who is the actual guitar player on this album) and Jeordie White (a.k.a. Twiggy from Marilyn Manson), Billy &amp; Maynard have produced yet another moving piece of art. Whereas &quot;Mer De Noms&quot; was more guitar oriented and reliant on electronic elements, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is a more stripped-down, organic affair. Sure, there are a few songs that fit in with the former album such as 'Pet' and 'The Outsider,' but for the most part, this is new territory. A supposed concept album about the effects of recovering from alcoholism or any other addiction (hence, the 13th step), this album works almost in movements. Each songs builds up to prepare you for the next, each moment seems carefully orchestrated. The album starts off in a very unconventional way, with the longest song of the lot, 'The Package.' 'The Noose' is possibly my favorite, a very quiet and moving track which is also one of the clearest moments on the album. Other songs like 'The Blue' and 'The Vanishing' are rather subtle and don't seem to fit in as well without repeated listenings. This is truly an album that you have to revisit over and over. Partly because it is addictive, and because a new part is revealed each time you absorb it. &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; took three years to come out. A lot of time and effort was put into it, and it shows. This isn't the second-coming of Tool nor is it the sequel to &quot;Mer De Noms.&quot; This album needs to be listened to with an open mind. It can't be compared to anything.
B00005JMCW|4.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theatures.  In fact, I saw it more than once I enjoyed it so much. I even bought the music CD right after I saw the movie.<br />The performances by both Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are multilayered, the support cast is superb and the characters are written so that the actors have substance to build their own characterizations.  Exceedingly rich exchange of emotions as the two actresses &quot;make the switch&quot;... I found myself loving BOTH of them and completely believing their performances from start to finish.<br />Mark Harmon plays &quot;The Almost-Step-Dad&quot; role perfectly as well: very realistic and human, not sappy at all.<br />If you are purchasing the DVD strictly for the movie, by all means.... Do so and love the movie.  I was disappointed in the bonuses, however.  When I enjoy a movie this much, especially because my children and I could enjoy it equally, I really look forward to the bonuses.  They were, in my estimation, worthy of about a two star rating.<br />Get the CD and watch the movie itself.  Briefly check out the Bonuses and see if you make them to be worth more than two stars.
B000005JA8|5.0|The people that gave this masterpiece one star more than likely forgot the music is an art-form.  This is clearly one of the seminal albums in the past 50 years, no question about it.  It is the masterpiece for a brillant artist.  Very few albums expanded the vocab of a genre like this album expanded the vocab of rock music.
B00004YYDI|5.0|The story revolves around a young girl named Matilda ( Natalie Portman). She lives in an extremely disfunctional family, and her dad has ties with local drug boss Mr. Stansfield (played wonderfully by Gary Oldman). Stansfield and his crew show up and wipe out Matilda's entire family, which leaves her as the sole survivor. She manages to escape and goes to her next door neighbor Leon( Jean Reno)for help. At first, she just needs someone to look after her and a place to stay. But Matilda soon discovers that Leon is a professional hitman. The lifestyle soon appeals to Matilda, and she convinces Leon to teach her how to be a hitman, so that she can gain revenge on the men that killed her family... <br />Luc Besson's &quot;Leon&quot; is one of the best movies available right now. The action sequences in this movie will blow your mind! They are intense and do not pull any punches. The story is absolutely oustanding. It is dramatic, funny, and so fast paced that you might get dizzy from watching it. The cast is great. This is Natalie Portman's first role, and she does an outstanding job. Also Gary Oldman plays one of the best villans that you can hope for. He is intelligent, cruel, sadistic, and just straight out of his mind. Danny Aiello does a nice job as the local mob boss that sets up Leon with his jobs and takes care of his finances. Last, but certainly not least there is Jean Reno as Leon the hitman. He is cold, calculated, and never misses the mark. Although Leon is a trained killer, you can't help but like the guy because he raises Matilda like she was his own daughter. Leon actually takes pride in teaching her how to be a hitman. <br />&quot;Leon&quot; is flat out amazing and one of my all time favorite films. The performances, thrilling action sequences, and touching father/daughter relationship between Leon and Matilda will keep your heart pumping, and have you reaching for the kleenex as well. <br />*WARNING - Make sure that you purchase THIS version of the film. The movie released in the U.S. called &quot;The Professional&quot; is missing a substantial amount of footage. &quot;Leon&quot; has over 30 minutes of extra footage that lets you see the film uncut and in its entirety. It is deffinately worth the extra money!
B0000VAFNQ|1.0|Sorry- It had promise, but didn't deliver. The premise of the two warring clans vampires and werewolves  - ok. The death dealers ( from the vampire clan) are chosen to hunt the lycans ( werewolves) until there are no more. Kate Beckensale's character, Selene notices that while hunting the lycans, realizes they are actually tailing a human and not for food-- hmm..<br /> This movie tries to be many things and ends up being a jumbled up nothing.  It tries action & technology, but its half-hearted stunts are silly,claymation especially one scene where Michael(a werewolf aka the love interest) after transformation looks like a weird incredible hulk! ( like the one in the TV show in the '70's).  There are scenes that look like they directly came from The Crow (scenes of roof tops in the rain) and Matrix but they don't have the effect I think they were wanting to achieve. It tries to be a love story- well, sorta.  --<br />I wouldn't be so critical of everything else if the story had been decent.<br />I guess you get the idea I really didn't like it.  It's a shame, I really like the vampire genre.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon)is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea with two bullets in his back and a strange device with a Zurich address on it.. He also has no memory of who he is. After spending some time on the boat to recooperate, Bourne heads for Zurich to find out who he really is. Almost immediately he is forced to defend himself, and he soon discovers that he possesses the skills of a very dangerous man. With nowhere to go, he turns to the aid of poor German traveler named Marie (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris. Racing to unlock the secrets of his own identity, he discovers that he is an elite government agent. His CIA superior (Chris Cooper), sees Bourne as a rogue agent, and dispatches assassins to kill Bourne. Now the government's top agent, has become its number one target... <br />I had extremely low expectations going into &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. Matt Damon has never done anything action related, and there have been many spy thrillers made over the years. I was pleasantly surprised. The action sequences are amazing, the fights are choreographed extremely well, there are tons of twists and turns to keep you guessing, the suspense is nail-biting at times, and the romance between Matt Damon and Run Lola Run's Franka Potente is great. Not to mention the fact that Damon is quite convincing and pulls the role off like he is a veteran action star. This film literally has everything that it takes to make a great movie. As far as the spy criteria goes, I was very pleased as well. The character Jason Bourne does not have any gadgets or gizmos to help him out. He must rely on his hands and his brain to get him out of jam after jam. This results in and excellent cat-and-mouse chase for the whole film. As you can see, the film does have a lot to offer. However, the reason that I cannot give it a five star rating, is due to the fact that it can be slow moving at times, which affects the overall pace of the film. Instead of flowing smoothly, it felta bit choppy at times. But for the most part, the film is extremely enjoyable.<br />This is the best spy thriller that I have seen since &quot;Ronin&quot;. &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; works so well, because it has something for everyone whether it be romance, suspense, action, or spy related. The DVD offers an alternate ending, deleted scenes, a making of featurette, and more.

Read it through dinner and to bed for two days.  The writing is not pretty.  It is written in unflowery language and sounds like a journal, which, to me, makes it taste, feel, and sound authentic, real and powerful.  It makes you sick, happy, sad, horrified, terrified, nervous, anxious, tired, joyful, and thankful.  I've never felt all of these emotions in such a short book.  I savored every word and reread passages that just astonished me.  This is a book and tale that will live on with Slavomir's memory.  I myself spent 2 years in a foreign land, went through many hardships and joyful events.  I can understand that when the event is over with, you don't want to revisit it because it is a blessed and horrific event that you have tackled and experienced.  I'm glad someone has written something like this to express those feelings in print.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay's Parachutes is a wistful, melancholy album whose futile yearning and serene resignation occasionally betrays a glimmer of hope.  It is an earnest expression of thwarted passion and aching regret, but it is also, finally, a hymn to optimism in spite of all this--an insistence that, though our loves may \\"pay us no attention,\\" we ought not to panic; that, though we never change, \\"everything's not lost\\".<BR>Throughout the record the band displays obvious chemistry, the piano amply complementing Martin's plaintive vocals while the drumming and globular bass lines offer subtle support to both.  On tracks such as \\"High Speed\\", a synthesizer offers a soothing, almost aquatic backing that evokes a dreamy atmosphere.  As for the songs themselves, they are generally languid and unassuming, characterized by contagious melodies and soft, subtle textures.  The electric \\"Shiver\\" and \\"Yellow\\" are two of the disc's best songs; they are tempered by thoughtful acoustic fare like \\"Sparks\\" and \\"Trouble\\".  That they made the 45-second ditty \\"Parachutes\\" the album's title track shows Coldplay may actually have a sense of humor.<BR>Less discriminating listeners are apt to pass this off as \\"Radiohead Lite\\".  This claim is unfair.  Indeed this music seems to encapsulate much of what is good about Radiohead--the memorable melodies, the Floyd-like moods--while dispensing of Radiohead's annoying political commentary and overcoming its bleak cynicism.  To me, Coldplay is ultimately more subtle and fulfilling.  Parachutes, an auspicious debut album and perhaps the band's best work to-date, is as good a place to enter their world as any.  Turn it on, dim the lights, and swoon.
B00003003R|5.0|I don't know what version of this CD you guys got, but my CD has only one track and it's 45 seconds long! I hear NightTrain starting off, then I hear Axl belching into the microphone. He sounds like he just smoked a carton of cigarettes a whole pack at a time. Next thing I know I hear what sounds like Axl slamming the mike down. Then there are angry steps going off stage left. Then the crowd starts getting real angry and boos. The last thing I hear is Slash saying &quot;Uhhhh.&quot;<br />That's all I got for my money. So I trashed my living room and set my kitchen on fire. Oh yeah I overturned my car too.
B00004RF9I|1.0|I can't count the number of great works of art heedlessly junked by the studios with terrible transfers.  I don't care about special features.  I care about respect for the films, and respect for the buying public.  This transfer is a disgrace.  Other Warners transfers -- Cabaret, All The President's Men, Deliverance, don't get me started on more -- follow suit with ruinous presentations.  Stop buying these titles.  Force the studios to respect the fact that none of us have money pouring from our pockets; that we've had enough; that we buyers are the market for these life-lifting works of art; that we demand proper due given these treasures.  The studios work for us, not the other way around.
0679428895|4.0|What a great escape.  Step back into time to experience what life in Pompeii might have been like.  Robert Harris does an outstanding job transporting you there.  You can see it, smell it, hear it, and feel the human dynamics.  Much like Titanic, you know the ultimate outcome, but it doesn't prevent you from wrapping your arms around the characters you come to know.  It's elegant in it's simplicity.  A very good read.  I didn't want it to end.

I liked this movie alot and its the only reason I got into Takeshi Kitano movies, if I never happened to stumble accross this movie late night on Showtime or Cinemax I would have never sparked an interest. I'm not a sheep so I dont follow everyone elses opinions, and you can trust my reviews I wont say somethings good because everyone else does.<BR>Try it out, Rent or buy.
1577311523|4.0|I have heard the concepts in Ekhart's book before, but its very enlightening to remember them through his words. The book takes you quickly into a deeper state of being NOW!!!!  It is an enlightened place between words and thoughts.  However, the very act of reading Ekhart's words quickly reduces them into a human concept which resides in the past!  Luckily he gives you a few ways to access your deeper self NOW.  But besides that, its a very easy book to read.  I believe that if we as a human race could all get more into the present moment of our lives, the world would be a more beauitful place.  Its time that the human race had an enlightenment revolution.  Good message Ekhart!! Thank you. Rock On...
B0000AOV85|1.0|What a disappointment and letdown! This DVD is not a concert but a documentary of how &quot;Dark Side&quot; was created. I felt ripped off also because the DVD sleeve misleads you to thinking that the tracks are taken from live concerts.
B00001MXXH|5.0|Part 1: The Movie  If the measure of a film's popularity is how many times you've seen it, then Ferris Bueller's Day Off is my favorite movie. I've seen it 16 times: 13 in the theatre during its original run, once on videotape, twice on a recently purchased DVD (once each with and without the director's commentary track).  Plot: One fine day toward the end of his senior year in high school, a young man named Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) ditches school and, with best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) heads for the big city seeking adventure. Beneath surface events, Ferris' &#34;day off&#34; is a last ditch rescue mission designed to save Cameron's soul. This is his last chance to help Cameron, because after this school year's over they'll go to separate colleges and, effectively, a friendship that's endured since the fifth grade will be over, Cameron will be beyond Ferris' reach and aid.  Ferris Bueller's Day Off has an elegantly simple, effective story structure, a classic example of separate plotlines that move concurrently, then tie themselves together at the end. There are two plot threads in this movie: (1) The story of what Ferris, Cameron and Sloane do during the day off, and how these characters, primarily Cameron, are affected and changed by it. (2) The attempts of Ferris' sister Jean and Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney to expose Ferris. At the end of the movie, the two plotlines converge and resolve each other when Ferris, Jean and Rooney come together at last, and it's Jean, changed by the events of her own &#34;day off,&#34; who finally saves Ferris from Rooney.  Matthew Broderick plays Ferris, for all his fast talk and con artist ways, as really the most innocent character in the movie, almost childlike in his belief he can accomplish anything. Ferris Bueller is an ultimate refutation of one of the great archetypes of comedy, The Fool.  The Fool is a person of childlike innocence, who naively believes he can accomplish anything, and our amusement comes from watching him fail. The classic example of The Fool is Charlie Brown. For decades, Lucy Van Pelt said to him, &#34;Come on, Charlie Brown, kick the football, I won't move it.&#34; Time after time, he fell for it. When Lucy swiped the ball out of the way at the last moment and he went flying through the air to crash down on his back, we laughed and said to ourselves, &#34;What a moron! I'd never be tricked like that.&#34; We felt good about ourselves by contrast. The thing is, our amusement at The Fool is essentially meanspirited and soul-deadening. The Fool says to us, &#34;You can't win. The game is fixed. Any belief in yourself, that you can accomplish wonders, is false and foredoomed to failure.&#34; What Ferris Bueller says to us is, &#34;If you believe in yourself....you can accomplish anything.&#34; Then he goes ahead and does exactly that, right before our eyes.  I first saw Ferris Bueller's Day Off in 1986 at the Ventura Boulevard Cinema in the San Fernando Valley. It played there for, like, four or five months. It was incredible. People simply didn't get tired of seeing it, thus the long engagement - especially by LA standards where movies tend to be there and gone. Though Matthew Broderick's portrayal of Ferris is obviously the linchpin that holds the movie together, what really made the film for me, bringing me back to see it time and again, was Alan Ruck as Cameron Frye. Without getting into a display of emotional scars here, let's just say that while I admired Ferris, I identified strongly with Cameron. Ferris is the kid we all wished we could be. Cameron is the kid so many of us really were. When Cameron explodes all over the Ferrari, he's expressing the rage for all of us.  It's a wonderful fantasy there could be such a friend as Ferris, who could see our (Cameron's) pain, would move heaven and earth to help him, and the person would find the strength to take advantage of it. There's a bit of a messiah complex to Ferris Bueller, a desire to save those he deems worthy of salvation. I'm sure one of the reasons he's been friends with Cameron for so long is that Cameron so obviously needs help. Cameron Frye is a long running personal project for Ferris Bueller, and one of the engines driving Ferris' actions in the movie is the realization he's running out of time, if he wants to effect lasting, positive change in Cameron's life it's got to be NOW. My favorite moment of the film, really THE pivotal moment, is when Cameron says, &#34;No. I'll take the heat.&#34; And sitting there in the theatre, I smiled and whispered, &#34;Good for you.&#34;  Part 2: Cast and Characters  The four main characters, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) and Edward R. Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) are perfectly cast. Really, all four actors do such marvelous work it's impossible to imagine anyone else in these roles.  Of Matthew Broderick's portrayal of Ferris Bueller, what can I say? Wonderful. Beyond that, any poor words of mine couldn't do his work here justice. For there it stands, magnificent in its own right. See the movie, you'll know what I mean.  For all the talk I've heard over the years of Ferris being &#34;the perfect kid,&#34; he's hardly a perfect person. There are aspects to his personality that aren't particularly admirable. He's deceitful and manipulative, probably a compulsive liar. When things don't go his way he becomes aggressive and abusive, shown most extremely when he slaps Cameron. But Ferris does have many good qualities. His lies are frequently in the service of the underdog, his deceptions designed to punish those who really do have it coming. While Ferris manipulates those around him in the movie, most notably Cameron, he justifies it by saying it's really for Cameron's own good. From what we see in the film, he's absolutely right.  It's interesting to note that, based on the director's commentary, I've always seenFerris as being a much nicer person than his creator does. One of Ferris' most impressive qualities is a complete lack of snobbishness. We see from Ferris' home life his parents are solidly middle class. Cameron's family is rich. Sloane, by her class and polish, was probably born with a silver spoon in her mouth, too. But Ferris can be friends with a white trash greaser like Garth Volbeck (Charlie Sheen's druggie character) as easily as a rich kid like Cameron. He simply doesn't see any reason he shouldn't. This total absence of classism is one of the things that wins Ferris such admiration among his peers. His friends at school go from the top of the social structure all the way to the bottom. When Grace, Rooney's secretary, lists all the various cliques at school that adore Ferris, and sums up, &#34;They think he's a righteous dude,&#34; she's right. He IS a righteous dude. To paraphrase Kipling, all men count with him, but none too much. [&#34;If-&#34; by Rudyard Kipling.] That whole &#34;walk with kings - nor lose the common touch&#34; thing isn't an unattainable ideal with Ferris. It's who he is.  For all his prevarication, when Ferris realizes he must take responsibility for his actions, or even something not, strictly speaking, his fault, to protect a friend, he'll do it. Something else people admire about him. After the Ferrari goes though the window and into the ravine, this is the only time in the movie Ferris is scared. He knows this is bigtime. This isn't ditching school, it's the destruction of a $200,000 automobile. When he says to Cameron, &#34;We'll tell your father I did it. I'll take the heat,&#34; he means it. When push comes to shove, when the rubber meets the road, Ferris is a stand-up guy.  Alan Ruck is amazingly good as Cameron Frye. All four leads seem chosen for their mobile, expressive features, but none more so than Ruck. I'm telling ya, the face of Plastic Man, folks. Ruck's features are so malleable he reminds me of a young Jim Carrey -without the goofiness.  Mia Sara, as John Hughes says during the director's commentary, is a perfect Sloane Peterson. This role required someone very pretty, very elegant, but also strong enough to tolerate and control Ferris Bueller. I would go further. Not only tolerate - enjoy. There's a theory in psychology called relationship balancing, the idea we subconsciously look for a partner who's strong where we're weak. Thus these two people together form in essence one fully functional personality. Sloane is stable, and quite up to keeping her cool in the face of Ferris' weirdness. When Ferris asks her, &#34;You want to get married?&#34; I'm sure at least part of the reason is to tweak her, to see how she reacts. She's completely unfazed, just takes it in stride. It makes sense a person with Ferris' chaotic lifestyle would be attracted to someone with her poise. But also, beneath that calm exterior, there's enough of a wild child to Sloane she can truly enjoy Ferris, and pitch in wholeheartedly, a willing partner in crime to his schemes. Really, she's perfect for him.  Could anyone else on Earth have portrayed Edward R. Rooney as well as Jeffrey Jones? I think not. It's totally believable that Rooney and Ferris would loathe each other. Rooney is the sort of stupid, pompous, authoritarian control freak that a free spirit like Ferris would instantly, and correctly, recognize as a natural enemy. And vice versa.  These four actors, all arguably doing the best work of their careers, are the heart of this movie.  Part 3: The DVD  There's only one &#34;extra&#34; on the DVD. John Hughes' (writer and director of Ferris Bueller's Day Off) commentary track can be run with the movie. Much more so than many director tracks, there's some really good stuff here. For instance:  * Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck worked extensively with each other on Broadway before doing Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which helps explain their easy chemistry. It's no stretch to watch these two guys reactto each other, and believe they've been friends for years.  * The best bit of commentary, for my money, is when Hughes discusses the sequence set in the Art Institute of Chicago, which was a kind of sanctuary for him when he was in high school. The paintings in this scene are those that were his favorites. Hughes' tone of voice, the emotions he expresses during this scene, are really touching. Prior to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, the interior of this building had never been filmed for a movie, and it was a big deal for Hughes to go back to this place that had been so important to him, and show people how beautiful it is.  * Charlie Sheen was only brought in for one day to play Garth Volbeck during the police station scene. With little or no time to rehearse, he burned up the celluloid anyway. If I can believe the Internet, Charlie stayed awake for 48 hours before shooting to give himself the proper strung-out look. In this scene he looks so much like his Dad at the same age it's eerie.  * The parade sequence was filmed during a real parade in downtown Chicago. This wasn't a situation where the street was cordoned off and filled with extras. The Ferris crew had a float in the actual parade. No one knew who they were. The crowd didn't know, probably the city fathers didn't know. When the music for &#34;Twist and Shout&#34; started blasting, totally of their own accord, people from the surrounding areas were drawn in, started dancing and singing along. All the shots of individual faces from the crowd weren't actors, they were &#34;real people,&#34; there because they wanted to be, looking like they were having fun because they were. The construction worker dancing on a scaffold, way up on that half-finished building? A real construction worker. John Hughes saw him dancing, grabbed a cameraman and said, &#34;You've got to get this guy.&#34; Then he looked at the street, saw it absolutely packed with thousands of people, all dancing and singing along with &#34;Ferris,&#34;totally into it, and said to the guy on the camera crane, &#34;TELL me we got that shot.&#34; Because there's no way they could have afforded to stage it, or even imagined something that wild. It just happened. TOO cool.  * There were several sequences actually filmed but cut from the final version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In one, Ferris goes on a radio program and talks about wanting to be the first teenager to ride the space shuttle. This was actually included in what would have been the final cut, and a trailer went out with some of that material in it. Unfortunately, the day after the trailer was released the Challenger exploded; the studio pulled the trailer and Hughes had to recut the movie to trim the shuttle stuff. I actually remember that trailer. I saw it during the day or two it was in release. If I remember correctly, a voice asks various people, &#34;What do you think of Ferris Bueller?&#34; and one of the respondents, a high school kid, says, &#34;Ferris Bueller? He's going to be the first teenager to ride the space shuttle.&#34;  * Also cut was Ferris' relationship with the Volbecks, the Charlie Sheen character's family. Garth Volbeck's father owns the tow company that hauls away Ed Rooney's car.  * Another excised bit: In the restaurant, when Ferris, Sloane and Cameron are brought menus, none of them want to admit they can't read French so they order something, then start eating, having no idea what it is. Then we get to see their reactions when they find out it's pancreas. This is referred to later in the cab scene when Ferris, listing to Cameron the things they've done that day, says, &#34;We ate pancreas.&#34;  It would have been nice to have the original trailer, revised trailer, and deleted scenes included on the DVD. While chances of seeing that level of work put into the DVD for a 20 year old movie, no matter how good, are slim (even assuming the chopped footage still exists) I can dream that maybe one day, on a future version of this DVD, it might happen. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.  While we're on the subject of wishes, why oh why was the music from Ferris Bueller's Day Off never released as a soundtrack? A crime, since it's got one of best combination of songs I've ever heard in a movie. Another &#34;I'd buy it in a heartbeat&#34; situation that'll probably never happen at this late date.  The later &#34;Bueller, Bueller&#34; edition of the film does not feature this excellent commentary track.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Some of you guys just dont know what you will do if DT doesnt make another Awake or 6DOIT.  Its classic, you have a favorite album that rocks your world and you think they should keep playing the same way on every album. Some of you are also afraid of technical playing and say that it lacks emotion and &quot;song-craft&quot;..well maybe you should start listening to Neil Diamond or Tom Petty (great song-writers..not very technical musically). As for me, I like my music to be interesting and challenge my way of thinking about how music should be played..DT does that with this album.  <BR>For years people have been complaining about Queensyrche for not making another Operation Mindcrime...poor babies. If you dont like it listen to something else or maybe open your mind a little. I guarantee DTs next album will be differnt than this one. Its called progressive rock.  This albulm is as good as any they have done..cant wait to see tham again live.
B0000A36J1|5.0|The two Towers (In theaters) was great. But this extended edition is Awesome...It explained so much more, its almost like seeing another movie. Everything is better.
6305127638|5.0|This is THE best Star Trek movie. Far superior to Wrath of Khan or Voyage Home. In fact, even my non-Star Trek fans loved this movie. If you like the Borg, or Picard, or The Enterprise-E, or just action, this movie is for you. If you are a Trekkie, you have no doubt already seen this and loved it. What more can one want than Picard, yet again, saving humanity? All else to be said has been said by previous reviewers.<br />The Line Must Be Drawn HERE! And I...Will Make Them Pay!!  <BR>Brilliant!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Well it is ovious that the previous reviewer did not pay attention to the movie and has no clue to the history of Vampires and Werewolves or else he would've known that werewolves have always been able to destroy vampires except for the stronger vampires. And this movie does keep with the old beliefs that werewolves hunt humans for food, the vampires do drink the blood of humans. What has happened is that they are trying to find other ways to survive without taking the blood of a human, but they do still drink it. this is a great movie and one that I am very happy to own. It has a lot of vampires, werewolves and a lot of action. If you like vampires and werewolves I think it will be well worth your time to check it out. Pay no attention to the negative reviews or the reviews of Jeff Shannon which hardly ever gets a movie review right. This is a great movie!!! So be sure to check it out
B00005LC1H|5.0|When I first saw this unparalleled comedy in the mid 1970's, I was attending a Grammar School in England. I well remember that after each new episode was aired, we would discuss it the following day with our History master during class, easily diverting him from the lesson plan he had. He loved it as much as we did. <br />I swear that many times during the 12 episodes, I could barely breathe as I was laughing so much.  There are so many funny parts in all the episodes. My personal favourite scenes are when Basil and Sybil have their verbal exchanges - priceless. Both the visual and verbal comedy are unsurpassed.<br />I only wish I could erase my memory banks of this show and watch all the episodes again for the first time!
6302250269|5.0|This iconic movie starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in the title roles is definitely NOT a chick flick - or if it is, then I don't understand what that term means. Thelma and Louise is nothing less than one of the great movies of the 1990s. Louise is a smart-mouthed waitress fed up with men, and Thelma is a doormat who SHOULD be fed up with men. With minimal planning or forethought, they hit the road - and, following a nasty event at a bar that results in near rape and real murder, they descend into the world of fugitives, running from the law in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. Brad Pitt puts in a super-memorable performance as a lowlife drifter who takes advantage of them in the usual ways. And Harvey Keitel plays a cop with a conscience, another memorable role for a great actor.<BR>The most thought-provoking part of the movie is watching the evolution of docile and fearful Thelma into a Strong Woman (capitals intended). The final scene as the law closes in, they lock eyes, and gun the engine, makes viewers cringe and say, \\"No, no, no, pleeese...,\\" but there is no other way this movie could have concluded. As a movie about feminism and freedom and free will, there's none better.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Lot's of people on here seem to hate this album, and diss the cartoon..Those people can F-Off, its there own fault for not downloading songs from it before they buy it....So anyways, i love this CD, lots of good songs, not all of them are great, but the reason i like it is because it has great bass, and im a car audio head, this CD has some of the hardest pounding beats i've ever heard.
B00005JM0B|5.0|T3 is far better than I could've imagined.  It begins a brave new chapter in the Terminator story, one I didn't think the film makers had the guts to try.  But they did and they really burned some bridges doing it!  I won't give anything away, but what they've done now is opened a door where the Terminator story can continue to grow, even without Arnold's involvement (he's a little busy being governor to make movies)and things can proceed to the next logical step.  I wasn't sure about Nick Stahl taking over the role of John Connor, but truthfully, Edward Furlong wouldn't have been believable anymore.  He's too punky to play the full grown Leader of the Human Resistance.  And Clare Danes is also a welcome addition.  Director Jonathan Marstow has done a fine job of letting the characters tell their story without the special effects getting in the way.  This is an outstanding movie.  (PS:  You gotta buy the DVD so you can see &quot;The Sgt. Candy Scene&quot; on disc 2.  It's hilarious!)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I must say that after watching Firefly - The Complete Series on DVD I am convinced that Fox Television is either A. Wicked Retarded B. Run By Satan or C. Freaking Crazy and Hates You.  FOX cancelled this gem of a show?  Buckfutters!<br />This is an amazing series.  If you like yourself at all, you must buy this DVD series and watch it repeatedly.  If you don't like yourself at all, then you must love watching FOX Television because they don't like you either.  Puhlease!  How much reality television can one person stomach?  <br />I love this series.  <br />Shiny.
B0000AFOHH|5.0|I've been waiting for this to be released on CD for almost 20 years (I wore the vinyl out years ago).  This remastered reissue is definitely worth the wait.  To me, this is right there with Six Wives as Wakeman's finest work.
B00005RD9B|4.0|Actually, both previous reviews are almost correct.<br />Instead of &quot;The Walk&quot; from the domestic release, this English version has &quot;The Caterpillar&quot; AND it also has an extra track: &quot;Pictures of You.&quot; So this import disc has 19 tracks instead of the domestic 18. Ironically, &quot;Pictures of You&quot; is the Cure hit no getting airplay in an oft-repeated digital camera commercial here in the States.<br />Of course, most Cure fans, like myself, will be buying this for the bonus Acoustic disc - but that disc is the same on both versions, hewing to the Domestic track listing. Not worth the extra bucks if you live in the U.S.<br />Cheers!
0688163173|5.0|After reading this wonderful novel, I have to wonder how anyone could give it less than a five-star rating. Lehane does characters better than any writer I've come across in years, knows how to build suspense that has you holding the book in a white-knuckle grip, keeps tricks up his sleeve that you never see coming and by God, he knows how to lay down the prose. There are many writers out there whose books I love to read, but when it comes to Lehane, I'm always waiting for the next one. Read &quot;Shutter Island&quot; and I'll bet you'll feel the same way.<br />Heck, read any Lehane and see if you aren't eager for more. Go ahead. I dare you.
0783208227|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I was only eight years old when I first saw it and ever since then, it has been on of my favorite movies.<br />    A bus accident claims the lives of Harrison (Charles Grodin) (a frustrated opera singer is overcome by stage fright), Julia (Kyria Sedgwick) (a young woman who has let the love of her life walk out on her), Milo (Tom Seizmore) (a burglar with a guilty conscience), and Penny (Alfre Woodard) (a single mother who must leave her kids to work the night shift). The accident occurs at the exact moment a newborn baby boy was brought into the world: Thomas Reilly. Harrison, Julia, Penny, and Milo become ghosts and are immediately drawn to Thomas. They become friends with Thomas. The problem is, only Thomas can see and hear them.<br />    When Thomas turns seven years old, the four ghosts realize that they are getting Thomas into trouble. They must sadly fade out of his life. 27 years go by and Thomas (Robert Downey, jr.) is a hard-working business man, who is in a relationship with a young woman (Elisabeth Shu). The relationship isn't going well, for he is driving her away. The four ghosts realize why they are connected to Thomas: They need him to help resolve one thing in their lives before they died. The problem is, in order to help them, they must take over his body. <br />    You'll all enjoy this heart warming comedy. I have many times. Buy this and you'll be watching over and over again.
B00008EYA5|4.0|...but I really liked this movie.  I came close to loving it, but I faltered about the time the plot did.  It is great escapism, and that Colin Farrell is quite attractive.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|It is Terribly underrated for starters. You souldn't watch this movie if you aren't interested in vampires or in Goth but if you are then it is the perfect movie for you. i have allready seen it twice in the cinema and i just wanted to come back for more. i have tried finding something about it on the web but it just isen't the same. i think i am going to the cinema again tomorrow to see it for the 3rd time out of 4 possible. I love this movie and you urge you to see it.
B000002TPS|5.0|Youthanasia is a classic metal album that is so often neglected and very overlooked. This album came two years after Countdown, which was a letdown coming after Rust in Peace. But Youthanasia is actually a return to form for this great band. This is short, crisp and tight version of Rust. While Rust was produced by Mike Clink (GNR etc), Megadeth switched to more intense Max Norman for this album, the result, a noticeable shift in the tone of Mustain's guitar. The molten riffs that the man creates are best heard in that tone, crunchy, tight and sharp. Also, most of the songs in this album are done in Dropped D tuning instead of the standard E that Megadeth used to prior to this. The result, a doom tone that cannot be missed at the same time sounding very very heavy.<br />The album kicks in with one of the fastest songs the guys have ever done, Reckoning Day, the topic? Mustain's favorite, i.e., getting even. Hence, he sounds pretty vitriolic (which I love) and even touches a bit of death metal style vocals in some sections. The beauty as always with Mustaine is his incredible sense of melody, which comes in the bridge section of the song with multiple acoustic guitar bits, a 5/5 monster of a song. Train of Consequences, excellent lyrics and an incredible power metalball that keeps rolling and rolling and seamlessly integrates into the intro of the next song, Addicted to Chaos. The brilliance of Nick Menza's drumming is apparent here. This is 94 and 3 years of Black Album and the world calling Ulrich the best metal drummer in the world, well, wakeup people, listen to this album to find out the best metal drummer. Addicted to Chaos is my personal favorite in the album, its neat, never forgettable riff and the beautiful backing guitars and lead of the song make it one of the top 20 best metal songs ever. Megadeth singing in French? Yes, but in parts in this amazing song which is so much better than Nothing Else Matters at the same time not being cheesy. This is A Tout Le Monde. Did Mustaine know that he would be quitting in 7 years? Hell knows, but surely the lyrics portray a sense of premonition on his part. The album gets hotter with Elysian Fields, a place where the dead live, the song is as good as the title is. Check out the mega-yelling mother-of-all metal riffs in Killing Road, mind blowingly wicked stuff only Mustaine could play. Pure metal genius flows into the next song, Blood of Heroes. Family Tree is perhaps a little week compared to other songs but still is quite a decent song. The momentum picks up with the doom-style great number Youthanasia, well mercy killing is not a very happy topic and the riff goes along with it but slowly the song reaches moshpit proportions. I Thought I knew is closely tied with Addicted to be the best song from this CD, a great number which will ring in your ears for a long long time, neat lyrics, excellent guitars, a classic metal song. Black Curtains is pretty descent stuff too but Victory is a tribute to this awesome band. Incorporating all the song tittles of early Megadeth this song is a classic. &quot;Had fingers in his eyes, had needles in his veins, A knife right through his heart, Dave Mustaine is a Victory&quot;...
B00008LDPU|4.0|If you really want to know how it all started, this is the DVD to get.  While the sequels touched on the origin of the Matrix, and tried to explain things a little further, the Animatrix DVD puts more of the story into perspective.<BR>Very original animations, from various artists, weave common threads of stories into more of a revelation than either of the sequels.<BR>Good sound and video quality.  If you own the movies, your collection won't be complete without this DVD.
0393057658|4.0|In pro-basketball the difference between the richest and the poorest teams (in terms of team payroll) is 1.75:1.  In pro-football it's 1.5:1.  But, in pro-baseball it's 4:1.  The convential &quot;wisdom&quot; says you have to buy success by getting the biggest stars.  So what do you do if your team can't afford it?<br />Billy Beane, GM of the Oakland A's, has turned to sabermetrics (the statistical study of baseball) to find undervalued players.  The most important aspects of baseball are not what we've always been told by TV commentators and other baseball-people.  The ability to get on base (even by a walk) and generate runs (instead of outs - including sacrifices) is more important than stats like batting averages and RBI's.  The most valuable players are also most often the most grossly overlooked.  Beane and his staff have been very successfull in exploiting this over the last couple of years.<br />The book is well-written and often very entertaining.  The only times I felt it grew slow was when Mr. Lewis was trying to explain some of the theories and statistics that were really important (then it becomes a 3-star book).  But some of the success stories of underdog players were really fun to read.  I reccomend it to anyone who has any interest in baseball, and I'll certainly pay more attention to the Oakland A's next year.
B00005JM02|3.0|I read the hype about this movie and the 5 star reviews and thought...yeah, this would be great for my DVD collection and my 5 year old [Ahem. I meant, I bought this PRIMARILY for my daughter!]  I was  half right! She loved it. Watched it over and over again. However, she wanted to know what happened to \\"Coral and the little eggs\\" since this was not shown. One was left to figure out that they were eaten. <br />I fail to see what harm showing them being swallowed [no need for blood and gore] would have done. It is a fact of life! The big fish eat the little fish. The sooner the little ones understand this, the better! Funny enough, we see the heroes swallowed by a whale....hmmm...a bit of double standard here.<br />The hero's partner is a forgetful cutesy blue fish who can read. Enough said!<BR>Having said that, the movie was for children. It should be rated ages 10 and under and not G. It was not funny, it just sort of moved along. It lacked the depth of story of the classics like the Lion King, Shrek, Toy Story I &amp; II etc. The animation was however excellent with very good sound! <br />All in all, I would have given the picture 2 stars for effort, lack of proper research and the idiotic cutesy sharks! Really now! Nemo's dad told him that the ocean was dangerous. This would have been an ideal time to portray the shark as the dangerous stranger not to be trusted or played with! But what do we get? We find FRIENDLY, Vegetarian Sharks! Only the USA would have a sharks anonymous where the shark is giving up fish. LOL!! And what's with these hippy turtles? As the youth today say... DUH!!<br />Why the obsession with dental procedures and pain?...what is this, an ad against Dentists? It only succeeds in making the trip to the dentist appear like a trip to torture land. Come now, surely Pixar can do better than this! <br />I added one star to make three because my daughter watched it over and over.<br />If you want a movie to entertain your 5 year old, then buy it.  Ifyou want a classic to add to you DVD collection, get the Lion King platinum edition, Shrek or Toy Story I &amp;II instead.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|At the risk of sounding like a teenager, this CD has some of the coolest sounds I've heard in a long time!  It's already over a year old and I can't believe I missed it when it was first released.<BR>If you like the sounds of the Ventures, Dick Dale's guitar, any classic Mambo, any light Salsa music, or just being transported to a tropical paradise, Ry Cooder's and Manuel Galban's music is for you.  Each track, unique in its execution and mood, is part of a familiar yet progressive set of sounds that transport the listener in inspiring ways.  One track took me to a bar on a Caribbean beach late at night.  Another track took me to a Cuban nightclub in 50's.  Another took me to a dance floor in Acapulco after a few shots of tequila.  And yet another made we want to take my surfboard out to the Hawaiian surf at dusk.<BR>Cooder and Galban have combined to create a unique yet familiar sound that conjures multiple images and moods all in one, a sound I might call 'tropical jazz.'  Sounds for the casual listener, the late-night listener, or even for the dance floor.<BR>To say I recommend it would be an understatement.
B00005JMGL|2.0|I took my 2 and 1/2 year old son to see this and was completely disappointed.  We didn't even stay to see the end because it was very BLAH!  It wasn't Peter Pan as I remember it.  It was the child's version of a love story.  Jason Isaacs was great, but the rest of the movie was terrible.  The special effects were all right, but nothing spectacular.  They looked fake. I would recommend renting this. It just isn't worth the $$$ for a matinee.
B00004XMV6|1.0|This movie is disturbing, offensive, indecent and just plain nauseating. Who is this sick, depressing little piece of trash targeted to? You guessed it, the ... Europeans who indulge in every form of ... imaginable, slobber over XXX-rated movies dealing with sick subjects, and voluntarily make their little children watch it with parents like a \\"family night\\". Fortunately, we Americans don't need to be forced to watch this garbage. Send it back where it belongs!
0061015725|2.0|The subject is fascinating and I believe Crichton is right in fearing the technology may go terribly wrong in the future. But I was ultimately unable to suspend disbelief in the last quarter of the book when Crichton totally left the realm of the possible and indulged, for wont of honest imagination, in utter fantasy.<br />His bot swarm development and activity make anything in \\"Jurassic Park\\" seem like the hardest of proven science by comparison, and it was far-fetched and belied a half-baked understanding of the biologically possible.<br />I was terminally disenthralled with this book and with Crichton as a serious writer. My respect for his work has been badly shaken by his indulgence in fantasy to make this novel work. It was JUST TOO MUCH!<br />Please, somebody, do this subject justice and produce a credible work of future fiction. Crichton has badly failed the subject.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|This CD is so bad it's funny! What the Hell was she thinking when she made this crappy album! She totally blew Oh Holy Night and the best thing about this whole album is her daughter sining &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot;. Whitney should never release another Christmas album.
B00006879E|5.0|While serving in Operation Enduring Freedom it was important to get my mind off the daily stresses and relax. This album is infectious and worked everytime! You find yourself saying &quot;I'll listen to it just one more time&quot;, over and over.... This is pure talent and the groove is unbelievable. The beat is great!!
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|I saw this movie a few days after it came out in theaters and I loved it! I don't understand why people are so hostile about the movie. The only thing that was like the Matrix was all of the slow moving stuff (Which is in almost every movie nowadays). Underworld was so much better than any of the Blade movies and Kate Beckinsale is awesome as Selene. This was definately one of the best movies of the year!
0790729725|5.0|Definitely one of the best movies to see not only for Mafia lovers but for everyone since this movie is an amazing piece of cinematic culture. <BR>Possibly Scorses' best movie ever.<BR>The cast is great and includes Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito, Robert DeNiro as Jimmy Conway, Ray Liotta as Henry Hill and Loarraine Bracco as Henrys wife Karen.<br />The movie is based on Henry Hills novel Wiseguy which I also reccomend.<br />The story is about a young irish italian boy who dreamed of being a wiseguy and  who finnaly got his wish. It's a mafia story told from the lower end of the system. Wiseguys are the ones who have to bust their humps to earn the money for the family, however there are perks which most of them enjoy, beautiful women, the best seats at restaurants, and lots of cash.<br />There's alot of violence in this movie, also narcotics use and faul language. <BR>The plot is interesting, and witty. The cast is entertaining.
0312263120|1.0|The book is dull, full of false cliches and loaded with wrong information. If the people at the NSA are that intelligent, we are heading for a disaster. The characters are coming from a third rate story and behaves like kids in kindergarden. As you read along, you keep asking yourself : &quot;Can they be that stupid?&quot; IF Susan Fletcher has IQ of 170 then we are all geniuses and the IQ system is flawed. <BR>Mr Brown should check his sources and respect his readers by doing some research. As you read the book, you would think that Spain is a third world country with very poor medical system and where everything is dirty. It is rather offending and makes you want to scream at this display of cultural ignorance and blind stupidity.<BR>But it is not the first book where one notices a lack of accuracy and strong bias towards cliches and preconveived ideas<BR>Don't waste your time and money. An tell your friends, we are the victims of publicity and they think we are fools.
0684830485|4.0|in for whom the bell tolls hemingway looks at war from the individuals perspective. his army is a rag tag group of guerrilla fighters, not the army. the time and setting is the spanish civil war. a general understanding of that war is helpful. the characters include mostly local insurgents and one american mercenary. the horrors of war are portrayed on both sides with neither having the higher moral ground.<br />it is also a study of courage in the face of potential death. this is developed not only through the underlying theme of war, but the stories of some of the characters earlier lives which include bull fighting and the running of the bulls. <br />the one drawback to the book is the stilted language used in the dialog of the novel (including the refusal to use obscenities).<br />a book well worth the read
0452285186|5.0|The best thing about _The Book of Bunny Suicides_ is that there's actually not that much gore involved.  Oh, sure, there are plenty of decapitated, disemboweled, liquefied, and otherwise visibly deceased bunnies in evidence.  And don't get me wrong: that's funny too.<br />Yet Riley is clearly among that rare but blessed breed of humorists who recognize that the anticipation can be even funnier than the payoff.  And so, right after he shows us three bunnies impaled upon a light saber, he shows us two more bunnies calmly sunning themselves on the beach as Noah's Ark prepares to depart.<br />On the downside, Disney may never hire Riley again once it gets a load of _The Book of Bunny Suicides_.  On the upside, he's already proven that this would be Disney's loss rather than his.<br />Funniest, bunni^H^H^H^H^HNO I WILL NOT MAKE THAT DUMB JOKE cartoon collection of 2003, paws down.
0385512104|5.0|This was a fabulous book. As you probably already know, it's a novel narrated by an autistic teenage boy. The choice of point of view here is wonderful, and I found it refreshing to be drawn into his mind, which is supremely logical and literal, and to see how he dealt with messy human relationships, emotional situations and the chaotic world. Even though I have only rudimentary knowledge of autism, I think the story helped me undertand it slightly better after experiencing the \\"inner life\\" of the autistic narrator for 200 pages or so. Overall, this was a short, entertaining, insightful light read, which moved along quickly (I finished it about a day).  I highly recommend it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love this cd. It has the best songs on it. Usually when I buy a cd I only like about 3 or 4 songs on it The rest are all fillers. But on this cd I like each and every song. I am the biggest Britney fan in the world!!! I love her and her music. I don't care what other people say about her. I woll always love Britney no matter what. She's so versatile and intellectual. I heard about her marriage and then her divorce. I know it was a publicity stunt but I think she was smart to do that. No other celebrity could ever think of something that brave. Anyways her best song on this album is Toxic and the worst is Early mornin'. Well that's all i got to say. I recommend you to buy this album even if you're a Britney hater. I'm telling you buy this cd right now!
B00003CXAA|5.0|What could I say about the Godfather movies? MASTERPIECE<BR>I wore out my box VHS set so of course I bought the DVD's as soon as they came out. I think those $80 bucks were well spent.<br />The Godfather trilogy should be viewed by everyone at least once in their lifetime. Its a piece of American Culture.<BR>Brando, Pacino, DeNiro, Keaton, Duvall and Caan are amazing in The Godfather movies. Plus the other cast are great.<br />The movie is about the Corleone Mafia family, their rise and movement, their involvement with other crime families in New York, their bussinesses etc.<br />The movie is a classic and produces some of the most famous movie lines in the cinema history...<BR>&quot;I'll make him an offer he can't refuse&quot;<br />So dont refuse to make this great purchase, if you're a fan of mafia or any of the cast it is a must have, it makes a wonderful gift.<br />In addition to the movies you'll get an extra disc with hours of extra features (p.s. click on the bunny and see The Sopranos watching The Godfather)<BR>extra features include interviews with cast and directors, Copollas strive to make the movie, you can see Mario Puzo working on the scripts, and look at the Corleone family tree.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Rarely will I take the time to schedule my day around a T.V. show.  If its a movie I am dying to see I will write it down in my calendar and catch it if I have nothing better to do with my time. If I am interested enough I might tape a show and watch it at a later date.  But, with Firefly I made sure that I was home each Friday night to watch this funny, intelligent, beautiful show.  As with Northern Exposure, I was heart-broken when it was taken off air (which I still don't quite understand).<br />I have already seen all the episodes, but I plan on getting the set just so I can have them close to my heart.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As opposed to other tribute concerts or concert films that have been around over the years, Concert for George is unique because it combines not only the aura of the Beatles (you can save the who's-the-favorite argument for another day) as well as the powerful spirituality and mysticism that were so central to George's life.  It truly is a celebration.<br />Even as someone who is a complete Beatles fan, the performances served to re-kindle a lot of the songs in my consciousness and it makes you realize just how great a songwriter George was in his own right.  So he happened to be in a band with two other geniuses.  The true lamentations are that it took his passing and a tribute concert to generate new appreciation and that his own solo output was so sporadic.  The film is very respectful of George's memory, and even if some of the versions of the songs are note for note copies, they are still great material.<br />Personally, I was most moved by Billy Preston's rendition of &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot;, McCartney's lead vocal on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, and, like many other reviewers, I am now in love with Sam Brown.  <br />All the people who want to snipe at McCartney for whatever reason, go ahead.  It doesn't change anything.  It's clear, at least to me, that George's death moved him and the fact that he subjugates his own ego (as much as is possible) to pay tribute to his friend with an excellent performance should be enough. I didn't see Bob Dylan anywhere in the film.<br />Be prepared to be moved, not just by the music but by your memories and the pure feeling of love that pours forth.
B000089RVR|5.0|I have thought this album was wonderful from the day I bought it. I am a huge Dido fan and was not in the least disappointed with her current effort. The songs, music and lyrics both, are haunting. I am reviewing it now because several of these songs have taken on a new meaning for me. It's amazing how much MORE heart-wrenching &quot;White Flag&quot; is when you can actually relate to what Dido was feeling when she wrote this song. Listen to the lyrics, you'll know what I mean. I feel this song, deep down. Several of the others as well. A beautiful album.
B000002JPA|4.0|How dare I question the omniescence of mighty Dream Theater? Well I will tell you. There are two things that put this album down a notch from &quot;classic&quot; status for me. The drum sounds and the vocals. Mike Portnoy is obviously one of the best drummers out there, however his drums on this release sound triggered and lifeless, something that luckily dissipated over subsequent DT albums. James Labrie is also a controversial figure for me. I just can't relate to his Dennis DeYoungesque sappiness at times (though yes I do like Styx). The band themselves would tell you that they did have some record company pressure on this (another thing that is in the past thankfully) and they succumbed to it partially. I don't buy the argument totally, but otherwise it is an incredible record and a milestone in &quot;progressive metal&quot; a genre that is debatable as it is ironic and contradictory at times. &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot;, &quot;Metropolis&quot; and &quot;Take the Time&quot; are ultra technical highlights. And yes they are still very metal contrary to the opinions of some other &quot;critics&quot; on this site. I wouldn't mind if the rerecorded the drums and Labrie tried to toughen up the vocals, but of course this band can never be Fates Warning!
B00006879E|5.0|thank god. a group that can actually sing. i'm a big darren hayes/savage garden and daniel bennifield fan.  i will put maroon5 on my A list as well. all these guys can sing. i listen to this cd all the time and can relate to the lyrics/songs. thank you .    erik  tampa, fl  also when are u touring in tampa
B000002UB3|4.0|This is among the Beatles' best albums, coming at the end of their career. &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; is a masterpiece that still sounds good today.
6305922756|5.0|I know this sounds trite, but this DVD truly goes to eleven...<br />Ever since the Beatles came to America almost 40 years ago, pop culture has been fascinated with English rockers. So in the early 1980's, when spandex and makeup were coming into play in the Brit rock world, it seemed only natural to make a mock-rockumentary; it was &quot;THIS IS SPINAL TAP&quot;. And boy, what a hoot it is. To this day, almost 20 years later, this movie is still very enjoyable, with its satire, silliness, and, actually, realism. Yes, many rock musicians have noted how realistic the movie is. Many of them admitted it on &quot;I Love The '80s&quot;.<br />As for the movie's humour, it's not for everyone. (See some of the one-star reviews written by rocket scientists who think Spinal Tap was a real band.) It's kinda dry. But if you get it (like I do), then it's hysterical. Take, for instance, the following:<br />Nigel showing Marty DeBergi his guitars/amps. <BR>Marty reading off some negative reviews for Spinal Tap albums.<BR>The band taking the stage in Cleveland.<BR>The infamous Stonehedge moment.<br />Priceless. This is actually brilliant humour; something that not every Chris, Mike, and Harry could pull off. (Get it?)<br />As for the music itself: Spinal Tap may have been a fictional band, but they might as well have been real. After all, the entire soundtrack was written/recorded by the actual actors. (That's right, that's really Chris Guest doing that solo.) ROCK AND ROLL!<br />So if you like rock &amp; roll and laughter, check out this DVD. (Lots of cool bonus features too!) It may take a couple of watches for the humour to sink in, but trust me, it will. Now I'll close this review with a quote from Megadeth's Dave Mustaine:<br />&quot;You know a tour's going bad when you start getting flashes in your head of Spinal Tap!&quot;
0679428895|4.0|Okay so anyone who starts out to pen a tale of the eruption of Vesuvius is severely crippled in the 'unbelievable twist' department but since the majority of people who choose to read this are going to be aware of it the task is really to create an interesting story before the inevitable happens. By and large, Pompeii succeeds.<br />The characters are fairly obvious-- 'hero', 'love interest', 'traitor', 'corrupt politico'-- and show little growth but since the story only takes place over four days I prefer it this way rather than have Harris try and cram in sudden, miraculous conversions. It's the plot that's important and the discovery of political skullduggery, bribery, and broken waterworks running perpendicular to a major catastrophe lends a lot of anticipation to the story. I was sneaking in chapters during class because I couldn't wait to see how subplots were going to turn out.<br />Harris never bogs us down with overly technical engineering details or geological facts (although I did skip the uninteresting quotes at the head of each chapter) and seems to know exactly how much info is exactly to enough to make us understand what's going on without boring us to tears. All the wonderful little details of Roman baths, banquets, and even fisheries add an extra layer of depth. I never even knew wealthier citizens kept their own fisheries, let alone prized some creatures so highly they decorated them with gold and diamonds.<br />The love between Antellius and Corelia does ring false, or at least severely premature, but in an age where women were chattel it's entirely probable a girl would fasten on to a total stranger rather than want to amrry someone old enough to be her father to maintain the family's wealth. I saw Corelia as a modern woman born into the wrong time (a nice change from the self-sacrificing wife or salty mistress these books usually offer) who found Antellius exciting and romantic because he stood up to her father and her family didn't approve. When you're young and oppressed you always embrace the rebellious choice.<br />I'm baffled by all the complaints about knowing exactly where the story was going, considering just looking at the cover tells you how it's going to end. Did you think the volcano wasn't going to blow up after all? This is clearly labeled 'a novel' not a mystery, a thriller, or even a novel of suspense. If you prefer improbable surprises to historical fiction I suggest you go browse that section but for an entertaing read about Roman life along with some action and intrigue this is an pleasant selection.
0312263120|1.0|Having worked in software, physical security, and with cryptography, I was intrigued by the topic.  Unfortunately, Dan Brown failed to do much research before writing this book.  It reminds me of an essay that I wrote at the last minute in English 101.  The grammer was correct, but none of the facts were accurate.<br />Virtaully all of the elements in the book were wrong; from the types of physical security that would be used by the NSA, to the computer security methods, to the isotopes and seperation methods used in the Hirosima and Nagasaki bombs.  It was like watching &quot;The Land Of The Giants&quot; ... improbable and incredible.<br />Don't waste your money on the book.

0385504209|3.0|Not that 1,597 is better than 1,596 reviews, but ... The writing did not disturb me, or the chapter lengths.  The anti-Catholicism was really low-grade heresy tho.  Constantine was not responsible for the number of gospels nor the divinity of Christ. And it gets worse from there.  The pure English religion stripped the Blessed Virgin as place holder for the most perfect of human beings. Martyrdom and sainthood were equal opportunity occupations until the reformation particularly in England sought to strip women of spiritual careers and forced them to burn their saint books.  Perhaps no other religion has a tradition of female geniuses and mystical writers as does medieval Catholicism. Women ruled spiritually not by goddess pretensions but by having a deeper understanding of the message of Christ than those scrambling up one artificial hierarchy after another. Christ came for all women; he had women followers MMagdalen --not the apostles -- got the scoop on the resurrection; and the early church thrived on female support.  The Merovingians were Catholic because Clotild converted her husband Lothar, France is Catholic because Joan of Arc chased out Henry VI, Constantine was converted by his mother, Helen and Augustine by his mother Monica.  A religion full of viragos -- no feminism needed till post witch-burnings (protestants 2 to 1 over RC's) and socially enforced marriage for all women for economic survival ... Amen.
B00006FDCD|1.0|I will not bore you with a summary. BUT the book is simply breathtaking: it captures the essence of childhood, its writing is fantastic, its characters are superbly developed. The first half of the movie is half decent, with the kids acting pretty good. Some things it left out, but the real attrocities are with the second part. A LIST: Bill in the Void (Early and Late) sequences are completely cut out. These are extremely important. THE KIDS GO THROUGH THE RITUAL OF CHUD TOO--IN FACT, THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO TRULY DO. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY DESCEND INTO THE LAIR OF IT ALSO. The filmmakers have no idea of 'He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts.' When Georgie (or IT) comes back, this is Integral; it also showcases Bill's torment. BILL DENBROUGH BEATS THE DEVIL (II) , where Bill uses the last of his childhood to save his adulthood is totally screwed up. In the book it is coupled with his dreams, and feelings of love for his friends, yearning for childhood, and the knowledge of leaving his hometown. Actually it is much more than this. What I just described is completely omitted. AND HE DOES NOT STOP IN THE STREET HUGGING HIS WIFE. Also,THE FINAL FORM OF IT IS PORTRAYED LIKE CRUD. Do yourself, the source material, the original author, and more a favor, and DO NOT SEE this movie. READ THE BOOK. You will cry at how beautiful and sad it is (I am not kidding; if you do not believe me look at the book's reviews.) But do not spoil it with this utter crud.
B000002KNI|5.0|On September 19,1981 a countless number of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel fans gathered in New York City's Central Park for this free concert. Some sat,some stood. Some brought coolers,lawn chairs,beach chairs and blankets. Some brought cameras and cassette recorders. Then-NYC mayor Ed Koch introduced the duo to the thousands of present fans. The duo starts with MRS. ROBINSON,one of their greatest hits,followed by another,HOMEWARD BOUND,then another,AMERICA. Then,there's Simon's solo hit,one of his first,ME AND JULIO DOWN BY THE SCHOOLYARD(sounds awesome with Garfunkel accompanying Simon!). SCARBOROUGH FAIR is an OK song. From 1966's SOUNDS OF SILENCE is APRIL COME SHE WILL. WAKE UP LITTLE SUSIE was a hit for the Everly Brothers in the early 60's. Another Paul Simon solo hit is STILL CRAZY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. AMERICAN TUNE is an OK song. From the 1980 movie &quot;One Trick Pony&quot; starring Simon is LATE IN THE EVENING. SLIP SLIDING AWAY is another awesome S&amp;G duet(they should have recorded it together in the studio instead of just Simon by himself). A HEART IN NEW YORK is from Garfunkel's SCISSORS CUT album,which was released shortly before this concert. As he told the audience, &quot;It's almost the only song in the show that's not a Paul Simon tune(composition).&quot; Then there's a medley of Simon's KODACHROME and MAYBELLINE,the latter being a hit for Chuck Berry. BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER sounds just as great as when S&amp;G recorded it in the studio in 1969. Another Simon solo hit is FIFTY WAYS TO LEAVE YOUR LOVER. Then there's S&amp;G's '69 hit THE BOXER,the version on this album featuring a previously unheard verse. OLD FRIENDS and THE 59TH BRIDGE SONG are OK. Then S&amp;G close with their biggest hit THE SOUNDS OF SILENCE. A video recording of this concert was distributed by 20th Century Fox. The video has THE LATE GREAT JOHNNY ACE,which for some reason,has been omitted for this album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a wickedly quotable television series that aimed too high, hit its target dead-center, then got cancelled by Fox Exec's whose job descriptions must read &quot;separate wheat from chaff... dispose of wheat...&quot;<br />The set includes 4 DVD's and 14 episodes, presented in the order the creator Joss Whedon intended.  Although the show was cancelled, each episode has tremendous replay value, and the series is as quotable as Princess Bride (&quot;My name is Inigo Montoya...&quot;), Pirates of the Carribean (&quot;You cheated!&quot;  &quot;Pirate.&quot;), Legally Blonde (&quot;... endorphins make you happy...&quot;), Whedon's own Buffy the Vampire Slayer, or any of a number of well-known and oft-quoted series and movies of the last few years.  Three of the 14 episodes were never aired, a real treat.<br />Firefly's dialogue is some of the best of the lot and the entire series is approachable for fans of old westerns, especially episodes like &quot;Train Robbery,&quot; &quot;Safe,&quot; and &quot;Heart of Gold.&quot;  Fans of twisty, devious plots will love &quot;Our Mrs. Reynolds&quot; and &quot;Trash&quot;.  Fans of Mission Impossible-style capers will love &quot;Ariel.&quot;  Those wanting strong character development will love &quot;War Stories&quot; (&quot;That was the torture talking!&quot;).  In fact, through the entire series the characters grow and evolve with each episode, which is possibly why Firefly died an untimely death.<br />The cast of characters was dead on in nearly every single episode of this series with the possible exception of the last episode, and even that ends in a satisfying way.<br />Whedon wrote fantastic male and female characters.  There's Zoe (Gina Torres of Matrix: Reloaded fame), who shines in \\"The Message\\".and has some of the most quotable lines.  There's Morena Baccarin as Inara, who is a: gorgeous and b: just too funny for words towards the end of &quot;Our Mrs. Reynolds&quot;, both in the delivery of her lines and the expression on her face.  Jewel Staite played Kaylie beautifully, especially in the episode where she joins the crew (&quot;Out of Gas&quot;).  Yet with strong female characters, Whedon didn't fall into the pit-trap of making the male characters weak, bumbling or inept.  The relationship between the Doc and his sister is much of what drives the series forward in this first season and the chemistry between them is perfect for close siblings (&quot;Safe&quot;, &quot;War Stories&quot;).  Mal is a fantastic character and after Firefly was cancelled, Whedon used Fillian to very good effect in the final episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  A show is sometimes as good as its villain and he made a fantastic villain in those episodes.  Baldwin as Jayne is superb as a treacherous, self-serving mercenary, occasionally hilarious (&quot;Jaynestown&quot; has at least one fantastically quotable line and his performance in &quot;Ariel&quot; was side-splittingly funny).  Zoe's husband is at least two different people and his relationship with Zoe is precious (&quot;Not every one gets Zoe and me, right off...&quot;).  Ron Glass (Barney Miller?) was the most enigmatic and potentially one of the most interesting characters as a Shepherd, a man of faith with a murky past, and one could easily see an entire season's story arc revolving around his character.  None of the characters is overshadowed or forgotten in the span of 14 episodes and all of them are worth watching.<br />But alas.<br />On the upside, there may be a movie.  Also it may well be that the series plays better in DVD format than it did on live TV with commercials interrupting the flow.<br />Highly recommended!
B00005KFUM|3.0|&quot;My personal favourite is Hyper Music as the guitar riff is so spectacular, you would see any axe player drool over bellamy's effortless talents.&quot;<br />Yeah, it is a great riff. It's just a pity Bellamy pretty much copied Rage Against the Machine's &quot;Snakecharmer&quot; from the album &quot;Evil Empire&quot; for it. They did add a nice bassline to the verse, though.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|i first heard of this band on a commercial on fuse and i remembered their names.  one day i rented madden 2004 and chapter four was on it.  i fell in love with the song and bought the cd and here i am raving about it.  i see them as a metal band but they can call themselves whatever they want.  this is a must have for any metal fans out there.
B000007MVM|3.0|As most of you probably know, Syd Barrett was the leader of Pink Floyd until his mental breakdown.  This is the first of his solo albums, recorded after his breakdown.  These are some of the strangest songs ever written.  Most of them don't make sense in a conventional sense, but they may have some inner meaning that only Syd's fragile mind can understand.  From what I understand, Syd was recorded solo, just singing and playing acoustic guitar, and then other instruments were overdubbed onto the tapes.  The results work fairly well, although Syd's singing and guitar playing sometimes are a bit shaky.  In fact, there is a false start before &quot;If It's in You&quot; where he hits an awful note.  I found this album to be only moderately interesting, but then again, I am not a Pink Floyd fan.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This collection features 14 previously released tracks from FLEETWOOD MAC,RUMOURS,TUSK,MIRAGE and TANGO IN THE NIGHT,respectively. There are no pre-1975 songs on this album so that means no songs from the Bob Welch era,also before American members Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac. The two original tracks are Christine McVie's and Eddy Quintela's AS LONG AS YOU FOLLOW,which was a Top 10 hit, and Nicks' NO QUESTIONS ASKED. This album can afford to be out of print since all tracks except BIG LOVE from the still-in-production TANGO IN THE NIGHT album are on the subsequent compilation THE VERY BEST OF FLEETWOOD MAC. Total playing time for this album is 65 minutes.
B00005QHV5|5.0|There are many Beethoven Symphony cycles out there, but this is my favorite so far.  The sound quality is head and shoulders above all others I've heard -- the symphonic textures are rich and easily discernable, as if you were sitting in the best seats of the house, in the best symphony hall.  Wand's conducting is also very good, and I particularly find his 6th and 9th appealing, for once tipping my preference towards rich modern orchestras instead of period pieces by Gardiner and others.  (It also doesn't hurt just how affordable this set is!)
0385504209|1.0|Dan Brown may be a bestselling storyteller but he lacks, or doesn't care about, basic writing skills. One of the first things fledgling writers learn is &quot;show, don't tell.&quot; This book is rife with mundane sentences stating that a character was amazed, or stunned, or worried, or that she/he looked puzzled,confused, alarmed. These emotions should be shown through the character's actions, body language, dialogue.<br />  Point of view jumps all over the place. Chapters begin with one character's point of view and before long, out of the blue, it's someone else's, then someone else's.<br />  The question is: Why didn't an editor pick up these blatant errors, along with misuse of capitalization (i.e. the Pope, when it should be the pope)?<br />  These things were annoying. I finally scanned the last half of the book simply to find out how the story ended.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|For R&B, this is a CLASSIC. Alicia's latest effort is better than SIAM. This CD shows a lot of growth and potential. This is R&B in it's purest form, or as close as you're going to get from a contemporary artist. Most of her peers are closer to Hip-Hop than Aretha Franklin or Stevie Wonder.<br />I'm almost 30 and I was fortunate to see Sammy Davis Jr. Live when he came to Detroit. So I can definitely appreciate Alicia's direction with this album. I remember Marvin Gaye, and that sound is exactly what we're missing from this generation of R&B recording artists. Alicia is helping to fill that void, but there aren't a lot of others like her. <br />Please open your eyes and ears and give Alicia's new CD a chance. Her CD is more modern, but it feels timeless. She really does have a lot of talent. I just hope one day we will learn to recognize those with truly unique gifts.
B0000E1WKE|2.0|well, i know several people who purchased this cd and they all returned them. i listened to it saying it couldnt be that bad..well it kinda was. the only  really good songs where the two from THE PREACHERS WIFE soundtrack. those where recorded when she still had a great voice. once again the new songs find her reaching and screetching for notes that at one time were effortless for her. ive read some of the reviews here and wonder what cd did some of these people listen to. i guess those are the die hard mrs. brown fans who refuse to believe that she has lost it.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|&quot;Dance Of Death&quot; is further proof of the talent and longevity that Iron Maiden has. Since Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith returned to the band in 1999, their sound has moved slightly towards the progressive arena, but unlike other older bands they have not compromised or catered to trends in an attempt to sell records. DOD's songs have contributions from every band member, including drummer Nicko McBrain's first songwriting credit on &quot;New Frontier&quot;. Maiden fans don't need to be reminded about how good this album sounds, and how reminiscent it is of Maiden in their 80s prime, but everyone else would do well to experience this album, from the opening power chords of &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; to the elegant, classically-tinged album closer &quot;Journeyman&quot;. Maiden: not just for metalheads anymore.
0792841344|5.0|Something is going on at Morningside cemetery. A strange woman in lavender is going around luring young men to have sex with her in the graveyard. Once there, after the fun, she takes out a knife and stabs them to death! The latest victim was a friend of Jody, his brother Mike, and Regie, the heroes of the story. While Jody and Regie are at the funeral, Mike rides his motorcycle through the cemetery, spying on the procedings through binoculars (Mike's been acting strange ever since his parents died. He won't let Jody out of his sight for fear of losing him too.) After the mourners leave, Mike sees a tall man (Angus Scrimm) pick up his friend's coffin and toss it in the hearse like it weighed nothing! Mike's curiosity gets him to enter the mausoleum to look around. He is chased by a groundskeeper who catches him only to be struck in the noggin by a flying silver ball. The ball drills into his forehead, shooting blood like a spigot! Mike takes off. He encounters the tallman again and crushes his fingers off in a door. Mike takes one of the fingers (severed, but still wiggling in a pool of yellow goo) home to show Jody, who finally becomes convinced that things are getting weird. They also meet up with several killer dwarves with super-human strength. Soon, Regie joins them. Together, the three set out to get the tallman and discover the secret of Morningside Mortuary, including extra-terrestrial activity and what REALLY happened to Mike and Jody's parents. This is an excellent low-budget creeper. Highly recommended...
B000002ADT|1.0|Maybe I got a bad copy, but the BUZZING and HISSING throughtout this CD was so bad that I couldn't listen to it. This in spite of a sticker on the jewel box proclaiming: &gt;The finest sound ever - newly mixed &amp; 20-BIT REMASTERED. Buy with caution?
0736041850|5.0|BUY THIS BOOK! The information you will learn is indespensable. The explanations are short and to the point and the diagrams couldnt be better. This is a must for any weight trainer who wants to take their lifting and their body to the next level!
B00008S2VG|5.0|ive read the reviews and i think did we hear the same cd. the ones who hate the cd usually only like die another day which in my opinion is the worst track on this fine disc. this go around madonna made a more pop flavored disc...most tend to forget she is a pop artist. yea there are a few space bleeps and so forth but its a pop record. its much better than music which really had no real focus to me. the record was way too busy no real sound to it but it served its purpose. im not the biggest mirwais fan and was shocked when i heard she was recording an entire cd with him but i was surprised its very good. yes lyrics are allowed to be simple sometimes as long as the point is gotten across. everthing doesnt have to be a metaphor like on ray of light. i love this cd and read a couple of old maddy magazine articles from the early days she has always really had a problem with fame and being totally happy with it. she is greatful for it but that doesnt mean she was happier with it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has a tremendous powerful voice that was not immediately perceived when she made her debut on the scene with her &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; song. While some artists are pure chameleons that change nothing but colors, Christina changed 180 degrees in the inside as well as on the outside. Anyway, fact is she has a damn good voice.<br />The only thing that got on my nerves was the fact I bought a CD that had 20 songs (a lot of Christina), but in the end it turned out that some of them were nothing but a minute long preludes to the songs that followed. Hmm ... felt kind of deceived here! Anyway, all in all it is a very good album with some powerful songs in it and there is a little bit of every musical style in it to please everyone.<br />And for all of you who have a problem with her attitude, for all I care Christina can go out on the streets and yell that Britney's voice sounds like a cat begging for food, that Pink is nothing but an over weighted bad persona wannabe and that Madonna explored her kiss thing with Britney almost to nausea levels just to end one of the worse years of her long career with some notoriety. And you know why? Because it's simply the truth!
B00005JM1F|3.0|Mitch (Luke Wilson) arrives at home earlier than expected to surprise his fianc&eacute; Heidi (Juliette Lewis), but it turns out that Mitch is the one who is getting surprised by his fianc&eacute;'s activities outside their relationship.  When Mitch's friend Frank (Will Ferrell) gets married he finds himself deeply depressed, which Beanie (Vince Vaughn) recognizes.  When Mitch moves into a new house close to a university campus Bernie comes up with the great idea that they should start a fraternity in order to get Mitch to get over Heidi and back into the dating business.  Old School is a hilarious comedy that offers some morals in an extremely funny way, however, the last act of the film seemed rushed which caused some awkwardness in the story.  In the end the audience is left with a good cinematic experience that will cause multiple laughs, and maybe offer some lessons.
1572700955|5.0|This audiocassette is one of the best books on tape I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Maureen O'Brien just brings every character to life--even Mr. Rushworth, something of a blockheaded cipher in the novel, has a personality all his own! I cherished every word, every turn of phrase, so brilliantly written by Jane Austen, of course, but so delightfully emphasized by the amazing voice, diction and acting ability of Ms. O'Brien. Forgo that horrible movie made of Mansfield Park a couple years ago, and listen to this cassette instead, if you want a dramatic presentation.
B00003CXAE|5.0|How could you not love this movie? It was voted the greatest musical of all time and rightly so. I think everyone knows at least one of the songs, even if they haven't seen the film. &quot;Grease is the word&quot;, &quot;Summer Lovin&quot;, &quot;Grease Lighting&quot;, &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot;, &quot;Sandy&quot;, &quot;There are worse things I could do&quot;, &quot;You're the one I want&quot; and &quot;We go together&quot;. And who hasn't heard John Travolta's high pitch notes? Or seen Olivia Newton John in those pants she had to be sown into?<BR>It is a classic.
B000088E6D|3.0|Michaels big band sound is the style he should stick to. Putting big band sound to How can you mend a broken heart, Put your head on my shoulders, Moondance(Van Morrisson owns this one), and especially crazy little thing called love dosen't work!! On the positive side I'll enjoy a martini coctail while listening to his beautiful sound for Fever, The way you look tonight, Come fly with me, and That's all.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|like one reviewer of the original (1969/70) version wrote, George's solo on the title track was one of the best reasons for having that album.  All other versions of &quot;Let it Be&quot; (&quot;Past Masters 2&quot;, &quot;1&quot;) have the orchestra like tinkling sound.<br />I was expecting this new version to retain at least that ravishing George guitar solo, but I was deflated instantly when I found out it does not.<br />For all the bad raps he's got, I also think Phil Spector's added orchestrations for &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; actually helped make the song better.  The version that comes with this re-release is supposed to sound as originally intended, but I don't see how it's better than the 1970 version.  FWIW, nothing in Let It Be has come out as intended.  Even its current position as the last of the Beatles album is a result of accident.  &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was supposed to be the last, and &quot;Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/In the End&quot; was supposed to be the Beatles' swan song, not &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot;.  But after you've heard &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot;, especially the soaring Spector version, would you say it was the wrong song for the part?  I don't think so.<br />This is still a good record to have.  It's not a justifiable buy, from a value for money POV.  Nothing recent about the Beatles is, not even the ridiculously popular Anthology albums, with the exception perhaps of the &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; which IMO is a worthy addition.  But for a diehard Beatle fan and collector, this is a must have.  But don't throw out the 1970/Spector version out just yet.  You might miss it someday.<br />Many years from now, I know I'll put the original on the player, crank the amps, switch to the title track, close my eyes, and listen to that rare, only-in-this-album-and-nowhere-else George Harrison guitar solo.
6305508550|5.0|This guy, my friends gets this movie. The guy that can make something as mundane and meaningless as writing a review, and make it funny, that is what this movie is all about. I have worked in flair places, and now I work in an office, and this movie is dead on the mark. I actually almost quit my job after seeing this the first time. Then my girlfriend found out she was pregnant, and you know the rest of the story. I did, for a brief moment have some hope from this movie, no longer. I can look back though, and reminisce about a time when I only had to make a huge paycheck to buy booze...
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I had heard of this film but hadn't seen it until last year. And it has to be one, if not, my all time favourite film. <BR>Baby (Jennifer Grey) is on vacation with her family. She is a typical Plain Jane, who stumbles upon the staff's area where they are dancing raunchily. Then along comes one of the dancers Johnny (Patrick Swayze). He doesn't like her, and when he has to teach her to dance with him he is not happy. But as the spend time together he sees that she is not that bad. <BR>This has some really good music, such as `I've had the time of my life', playing as the final dance sequence plays out.<BR>A dazzling film with the added bonus of Patrick Swayze being really cute and having a really good body!
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna is up to her latest tricks, the only thing is no one cares anymore. The only thing shocking Madonna could do is to not try to get our attention. Her first album in 2 and a half years, since 2000's MUSIC, is AMERICAN LIFE. I really tried hard to like this album. The title track is a joke, one of the worst songs I've heard in a long time. Her concept of what American Life is is very funny, because most people don't have 3 nannies, and a staff of people. A lot of people have a lot worse actually, so why is she complaining about having too much? &quot;Hollywood&quot; is pretty funny if you read between the lines, since she has tried so hard to become a &quot;serious&quot; actress in Hollywood time and time again and failed miserably. But before I trash the rest of the album because it is trash, I want to point out the good songs. &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; is a really beautiful ballad that should have been the first single, not the third (honey the album is dead put a fork in it, it's done). &quot;Intervention&quot; is also a nice song. &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; is the best dance song on the album. &quot;Mother And Father&quot; has to be the most juvenile song I've heard from her in a while, I mean those lyrics are just so petty and immature. Didn't we cover the loss of your mother many times ago on many other songs? Not to discredit her but she did it way better on songs like &quot;Mer Girl&quot; or &quot;Promise To Try&quot; from past albums. It seems Madonna has run out of ideas, and she worked again with Mirwais making one of the worst albums of her career, and one of the worst of 2003.

B00007ELEL|5.0|This movie, it will grab you and tug you in your heart, until you die. Once you see Lebowski, you are never quite the same. There are two types of people in this world, those who get this movie, and those who don't. I am not saying you are a bad person if you don't get this movie, well maybe I am. If you don't find this movie funny, you have a bad sense of humor. I am not saying you should like fall down laughing, but this movie should at least make you gaffaw at the very least. ...... .. .. excuse me, I had to stop typing because I laugh just thinking about this movie. For real...believe it
B0000DCGT3|5.0|This is a must buy movie, it's just so funny.  It's a great end to the series, I hope they release a special triolgy box set of America pie because it is one of those movies you can just watch and watch. <br />This movie shows how all of the characters have 'matured' into adults, parties are switched to bars and snack houses switched to restaurants.  The humour is still all there though and I love it.  It's the funniest of them all in my opinion and a must buy for any fan of the previous two movies!<br />5 Stars
6300189473|5.0|This is a great movie to get you in the mood for Christmas as it approaches.  It is great for the kids as it is clean, i.e. no swearing or immorality and it incorporates the legend of St Nicholas through to what the kids know Santa Claus to be today.  The costumes are bright and fun and the role of the two children in the story doing what probably many children have always wanted to do.  It has become a tradition in our house to see it once a year.
B00005JLYW|2.0|This is one of those movies where it's obvious that everyone involved in making it had fun doing so, but one wonders if they considered the enjoyment of the actual movie goers. The stunts, for example, I love a good action, but I really am frustrated when all the hyped stunts are overly edited and processed with all the pretentious slow-motion tricks and multi-angle camera movements. It actually ruins any potential viewing enjoyment. The more slow motion and rapid cuts there are, the less impressed I am. <br />The music is also a lead character in this movie, because obviously the dialog is of no importance, otherwise they wouldn't drown out all the good jokes with the plodding music.<br />Let's see though, there were a few good moments: Bernie Mac, John Cleese and Crispin Glover are in it. Crispin is such a cool and creepy 'baddy'. Demi, well, Demi is her usual gorgeous liposucked enhanced self. Oh and Diaz, Barrymore, and Liu are in it too.<br />I suppose the best scene would be the fight at the cargo warehouse at the harbour between Seamus and his gang versus the Angels. Not that the scene really needed it, but the Prodigy song lands an additional punch to the already fiesty, dirty, brutal hand-to-hand brawl. Nice and gritty. <br />As for the DVD: No deleted scenes even though some do appear briefly in the outtakes or the Making Of documentaries. The Full Throttle Jukebox is silly, especially since the director and his music supervisor's comments are, like, you know, totally, cool, like, ya know. <br />Sure is fun to point out all the things wrong with this flick, aye? Now you probably wanna run out and buy it, right?
B0000VAFNQ|4.0|i didn't really care for this movie because i expected allot more action and even though it was cool i didn't like Kate Beckinsale in this movie and it isn't what i expected.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|I was sorry I spent the money. After hearing that Afterglow was going to be released soon, I waited with anticipation, only to be disappointed with the mundaneness of the album, the lyrics and the music.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The special extended edition is a real thriller. It gives you about 43 min of extra scenes. The movie it self is really good. You can tell they worked on it really hard. The movie is about 3 and a half, so might as well lay down and relax!!
B000051Y0G|4.0|Cyndi's debut dazzles with fun and exuberance, for at least the first half of the album anyway. The first six tracks are probably the most delightfully infectious collection ever recorded by any artist in the 80s. It's almost comes across as if she's a young girl, rediscovering the exciting new wave sounds and analogue synths for the first time, and imbuding her wacky persona throughout. Ironically, she finally popularised new wave in America just as the genre itself had died out, although the synths serve mainly to give her otherwise anthem pop songs and power ballads an even wackier sound. Unfortunately it all dies out by side 2 of the album, towards the end the album struggles for life through increasingly generic new wave fodder without hook or charm, giving the whole affair an impression of being several dazzling singles being held together with filler.<BR>Best Tracks: Money Changes Everything, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, She Bop.
B00003CY6M|5.0|i really liked this movie because it's tottally sweet.worth watching for a date movie.
B00008PW2D|4.0|Okay, let me start by saying, you all knew there would only be 8 episodes in this season! It says so in the description! So, you should have known what you were getting into even before they were released! Okay, that being said, SATC is a great show, and I love it even more now that I am living outside the country and don't have HBO. SATC has been a taste of home and continues to be my favorite way to pass the time!
0671027344|4.0|Normally I do not much enjoy reading books being a part of our school lessons but this one was an exception. It was not boring like the other school readings even I was a bit sceptical about it at first. The book was interesting and pleasent to read. Stephen Chbosky writes about a freshman named Charlie and his experiences in his first year at high school where he gets to know the sophomores Sam and Patrick during a football game. The whole story is told in the form of letters Charlie writes to an unknown \\"friend\\" but does not receive any replies because he stays anonymous. He tells him many intimate and private details about his life and his feelings including the more or less typical teenager problems connected with subjects like relationsships, love, sex, pregnancy, homosexuality, alcohol, drugs, psychiatric problems and death. The characters are interesting and the author leaves a distance to them which makes the reader ask himself questions about the occurrences. After finishing the book you start to think about some situations in a different way.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Let me tell you one thing. This is one of the best Rock music DVD's you will ever see.<br />Angus is the real show here. He gives us 15 minute solo's. They sound is very good. Sometimes you get live versions of the music and does not sound like the studio versions. This is not true here. The 5.1 DD is good and the video is sharp and bright.
B00005JM0B|2.0|Yes, we've all heard it by now: James Cameron did not direct this film.  And we must get over it.  I agree that it is not fair to judge the film against Cameron's filmmaking.  But we must still rate it as an action film.  And in my opinion, \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" fails to meet my standards.  The opening to the film is completely uninspired and it borrows much from the first two films, albeit with more humor and a lighter touch.  Moreover, I felt that the film really did not go anywhere.  There was absolutely no plot in this film.  Most action movies lack plot, but they make up for it with terrific action sequences-I did not feel that I was shown any in this film.<br />While I enjoyed where the movie ended up, it certainly leaves the door open for another disaster film to be made.  Arnold hardly gets any screen time and his character certainly receives no development.<br />\\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" made a lot of money because people had high expectations.  Unfortunately, I do not feel that this movie delivered.  If you haven't seen these films, you're better off just watching T1 and T2.  Hold off on this one.
B000089RVX|5.0|Anything I can say has already been said here. I love this album and would easily and without hesitation recommend it.
0679441018|1.0|This book is absolutey dreadful. I'm working my way through The Vampire Chronicles and had enjoyed all the books up until this one. I now have reservations about reading any of the others considering how bad this one is. The book started out fairly well with the mixture of Lestat's pursuit of Roger and the mysterious being that is stalking Lestat. Unfortunately, the book quickly becomes a ridiculous history of religion as seen through Rice's eyes. A pity. The beginning of the book could have led to so many interesting plots. Why Rice chose the &quot;plot&quot; she did is beyond me. This is a book to avoid. The books leading up to this one are all worth checking out (even the somewhat less successful The Body Thief is pretty good).
B00008EYA5|3.0|I honestly did not have high expectations for \\"S.W.A.T.\\"-I figured any picture based upon the old T.V. series would end up being an explosive film that lacked character and plot.  From the opening scenes, however, I must say that I was impressed by Clark Johnson's carefully planned opening sequence.  Based upon the N. Hollywood Shootout, the opening is shot in fractured frames, giving the feel of amateur or news station photography.  Johnson jumps back and forth between these slow-motion frames and live action, contrasting the difference between being at the scene of the crime and being at home watching the footage on the news.  The opening sequence is absolutely thrilling and I really had high hopes after watching it.<br />Enter Samuel L. Jackson.  While his performance is strong (as can be expected), the plot just did not allow any of the actors any breathing room.  We have a classic plot line: an old-timer hero of the S.W.A.T. squad (Jackson) assembling an elite group of somewhat problematic team members (including the \\"bad\\" female) to improve the image of the force.  While they are battling the most dangerous of criminals, they are also dealing with the bureaucracy and politics of the job.  Colin Farrell plays the rookie who has as much charisma and skill as the seasoned pro.  I quickly became tired of Colin's \\"hard-to-get\\" attitude, however.  And he gave up being a Navy Seal to become a S.W.A.T. member?<br />I was encouraged by a somewhat different plot line-trying to transfer a dangerous criminal while warding off other criminals who are trying to collect a reward for preventing them from succeeding.  The moment the \\"revenge\\" angle gets introduced to the plot, however, \\"S.W.A.T.\\" falls into a classic plot trap and loses my interest.  The last twenty to thirty minutes of the film drag in my opinion.  All in all, \\"S.W.A.T.\\" is not a bad film for what it is-an expensive action film with no heart.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have read all the reviews for this CD, HEY they are quite alot. I still belive that this CD is great. It appeals to those of ust hat have a little more age under our belts. True that some of the songs where overplayed, but the rest of the CD is unique and make you think of the style of Rock that has been missing from the industry in along time. If you think you want to listen to a CD that has soul and a clean musical sound this is it. If you want a CD that is all music and you cannot understand the lyrics without erasing half of the musical instruments, then do not buy this. If you are into the new type of heavy metal, then don't buy this. If you expect all the songs to sound alike and have the same beat and rythm, don't buy this. If you are looking for something that resemblems that earlier begins of PUNK and Heavy Metal, then you need to get this CD, it'll bring back some great memories. If you're looking for a CD that can make you experience half of the emotions on the spectrum then you definately need to buy this CD.
B0000DCGT4|3.0|\\"American Wedding\\" is not a great film...it is not even a good film.  But I managed to watch it all the way through and was reasonably entertained, so I'm not going to complain about it.  With the setup of the first two lackluster films, the bar was not set very high for the climax.  One surprise is the rise of Stiffler, who has grown large enough to dominate the entire film.  Though, in order to do so they have had to dumb down his character even more so than in the first two films.<br />I did not find \\"American Wedding\\" hilarious, but it certainly has enough laughs to keep the pace light and fast.  If you're looking for a fun movie to rent and you liked the first two, you might try this film on for size.  It's reasonably entertaining and requires no brain effort to watch.
B000084T18|1.0|This album is wack, yo. Hip-hip by the numbers with an emcee who can't rhyme and radio-friendly fodder like '21 Questions' but it don't matter, cus HE BEEN SHOT NINE TIME! <BR>I've heard better 'music' at the National Zoo (primate house) but it doesn't matter. No, it doesn't matter one bit. You'll buy this garbage because 50 CENT BEEN SHOT NINE TIMES!
B00008IAMD|5.0|The first thing you hear when you turn this album on is a song about the end of the world.  The title track of this CD uses many biblical citations, primarily from Daniel and the Revelation, urging the faithful to not forget that the end is still to come.  This seems like a dark note to start at the beginning of an album like this, but it's an exact precursor to what will be happening for the rest of the disk.<br />This album is visibly the work of a man who knows he's at the end of his life.  There are songs about dying (&quot;Streets of Laredo,&quot; &quot;Danny Boy&quot;), songs about killing (&quot;Sam Hall,&quot; &quot;I Hung My Head&quot;), and songs about being left behind (&quot;Desperado,&quot; &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;).  Authors of these songs include Lennon and McCartney, Paul Simon, Sting, Don Henley and Glenn Frey, Hank Williams, and Trent Reznor -- an eclectic mix if there ever was such a thing.<br />It's possible to listen to this album several times before you realize what's missing.  There are no drums on this album.  This is barely noticable from the distinctive orchestrations by a peerless band.  At times, even the piano stands in for the drums, and you'd swear there was a trap set right there.  But it's not.  The band is that good.<br />Guest artists on this disk include Fiona Apple, Marty Stuart, Don Henley, and Nick Cave.  What more needs to be said about Johnny Cash's eclectic appeal, even at the end of his life?  If he could earn the loyalty of artists who have almost nothing in common with him stylistically, surely he was one of the great artists of our lifetime.<br />No album is perfect.  Some people may never be able to acclimate themselves to Cash's thready voice on this CD.  That's a shame, because the way he sings only heightens the theme of a dying farewell.  The song &quot;Give My Love to Rose&quot; seems extraneous, and I've never liked &quot;The First Time Ever I saw Your Face.&quot;  But in a fifteen-track disk, twothrowaway songs are nothing at all, especially in the face of the staggering quality of the other songs.<br />And even at the end of his life, Cash remained an artist of rare, unstoppable quality.  Trent Reznor's &quot;Hurt&quot; is rendered so thoroughly into a country song that Nine Inch Nails may never be able to play it again.  (The accompanying DVD, featuring the video directed by Mark Romanek of &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; fame, is to die for.)  Cash was even able to make the feeble concluding verse of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters&quot; sound like a work of art.<br />Johnny Cash was the type of man who comes around only once in living memory, and &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; is a fitting exclamation point at the end of an epic career.
B00004W510|4.0|not quite as good as Big Pink but pretty good anyway. the main complaint i have is that Robbie Robertson is not a good guitar player. everyone on these reviews keep saying that the guitar solo in King Harvest is so great, honestly it sounds like a 10 year old could have played that solo better. obviously hes talented since he writes most of the songs, but the thing with The Band is that it always sounds like a group effort. I especially like the songs that sound like the vocals are coming from the other side of the room (jawbone) and most of the songs sound like live takes. most of their biggest songs are on here and most are enjoyable. I still have a problem distinguishing between Danko and Manuel on alot of the vocals, they sound kinda similar.
0375703861|5.0|A wonderfully hilarious look at two generations of two families in modern Britain.  After divorcing his first wife, simple, dependable, white-bread Archibald Jones marries a half-black Jamaican woman and renews his acquaintance with Samad Iqbal, his old war buddy.  Archie and Clara have a daughter, Irie, an intelligent, ambitious girl who nevertheless finds herself a social outcast.  The Iqbals, &eacute;migr&eacute;s from Bangladesh, (formerly Bengal), suffer from a serious case of culture clash, which lends this book much of its satiric bite.  Samad wishes to preserve his proud Bengali heritage and pass it on to his twin sons, Millat and Magid, but finds his efforts thwarted by the corrupting power of North London society.<br />None of these people really fit in, and their efforts to pull through anyway make us want to cheer them on despite the silliness and hypocrisy we see in them.  Enough family history is spelled out to make us realize how much each of these people are programmed by attitudes and events that held sway before they were even born.  Some of it seems ludicrous, much of it is irrational, but being the past, it can't be escaped.  Do we even have choices, or are our lives predetermined by accident of birth?<br />This novel asks us to examine the question of how the individual fits into society, and at what point our own inner need to express our individuality (as well as our heritage) becomes a detriment - not only to society, but to ourselves because of society's reaction to us.  With the introduction of the super-mouse, a product of modern genetic engineering, Smith seems to be championing (or is she skewering?) the unpopular notion that only through greater uniformity can we ever hope to overcome mankind's seemingly innate tendency to hate and fear anyone who seems different - that if disappearance is the price one pays for assimilation, then let's pay up and before even one more child grows up hating herself because she doesn't look like the girls in the magazines.  A delightful ride on a post-modernist roller-coaster, with memorable characters, delicious dialogue, and plenty of serious points to make.  This book is a must-read for intellectual young women who felt they weren't popular in school, but many conservative white Anglo-Saxon males will wonder what all the fuss is about.gazines.

B00006LLLN|5.0|This CD is pure, unadulterated beauty. The vocals and intruments are recorded clearly, the music is poignant; you can hear the emotion in every verse or tune. These live versions of Alison Krauss and Union Station's hits along with traditional bluegrass songs are very strong, even surpassing some of the studio recordings of the same.
B000002J1S|5.0|\\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" is the best album ever recorded.<br />Genesis carreer should have ended with this double album. After the tour that followed, lead singer and composer Peter Gabriel left the band and they started to lose quality until Genesis degenerated into a hit-single factory. That could be right if the hit-singles were good, but they are not...<br />It takes time to realize that this album is a masterpiece. First of all, it is a long album, with lots of «information», and in the first auditions some of the songs are kind of hard to listen to (very different from what you can hear on the radio or on TV). It is easy to understand that the album tells a story but that story is hard to puzzle.<br />So, if you think you have no time to listen to a record several times before starting to get pleasure from it, stop reading this review now. Go search for Robbie Williams or Celine Dion instead.<br />Now, for those of you who like to be surprised by a record, who like to sit quiet and alone listening to the music, paying attention to the lyrics and dreaming a world that could exist, I shall continue with this review.<br />Compared to earlier Genesis albuns, Lamb is quite different. The typical progressive rock length songs (8,9,10 even 23 minutes long) are over, except for \\"In The Cage\\" and \\"The Colony Of Slippermen\\" which are the songs more similar to what Genesis have done till 1974. While the previous albuns were clearly part of the symphonic/progressive rock movement, Lamb seems a little more personalized as if Genesis finally discovered their unique sound. For example, the guitar and organ solos are fewer and shorter. This is a band telling a musical story and not a group of talented players showing their virtuosity. It is curious to notice that the same kind of evolution happened to bands like Marillion (from 8-minute songs to the concept-album \\"Misplaced Childhood\\") and Pink Floyd (from lengthy songs to the opera-rock album \\"The Wall\\"): they start telling a story in just one (long) song and they end telling a story in an entire album using short songs.<br />Although there are some very good songs that, in a fair world, could be reasonable successful singles, like \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\", \\"Counting Out Time\\", \\"Carpet Crawl\\" and \\"Anyway\\", most of the themes are intended as part of the album. They only make sense in the context of the album. For instance, no one can say that \\"The Waiting Room\\", \\"Silent Sorrow In Empty Boats\\" or \\"Ravine\\" are great songs. But they fit great while listening to the whole album. Personally, I like records that are more than just a collection of songs.<br />Besides its fantastic melodies and moods, I believe the true force of Lamb lies in its longevity. It's an album I can't get tired of. Every time I listen to it, I notice something new. The story adds to this sensation, because it is kind of surrealistic and there's always some details you can't understand. I suggest reading the text written by Peter Gabriel himself included in the album - it helps to understand the lyrics. Reading carefully the lyrics also helps understanding the text, so you need both the lyrics and the text to get the story. I'm not going to say anything about the story because I don't want to spoil the pleasure of discovering it and you should interpretate it using your own mind.<br />For me, the only negative point about Lamb is the end. I believe \\"It\\" is the weakest theme and it fails to give the album the end it deserved. On the contrary, the start is tremendous with the beautiful, fast keyboard introduction that soon leads to the start of the song itself - \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\".
B0000AQZYM|5.0|finding nemo is the best film of 2003 hands down. when i went and seen this movie in theaters i saw 60 year olds and 19 and 24 year olds laughing and loving ever bit of it. this movie delivers a good time &amp; laughter you will cry and root for marlin to find nemo and take him home. if you dont have this movie buy it now  buy it today.
B00005JKN9|3.0|I agree with csymphony in the fact that Leo was hugely miscast, Depp would have been ideal for this movie, he has a presence on screen that is unequaled.<br />I also agree with wtdk in that there was obviously a lot of film cut out in the last part of the movie.  While the first part of the film was very well done and a good example of Scorsese (did I spell that right?), the ending sceen was disappointing and pathetic.  <br />So why three stars?  It was all Daniel Day Lewis, he earned every one of them in my opinion.  If I could rate the film based soley on his performance, it would get 6 out of 5 stars.  His performance was riveting, completely convinvcing as &quot;The Butcher.&quot;  He (along with the production design) is the only reason why I recomend buying this DVD.<br />Ms. Diaz, nothing.  Not a good performance, but not a bad one either, she could have been played by any attractive actress.  It seems her casting was just to use a big name to help sell the film.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I had first watched this movie a couple of years ago and I remember just really liking it, but recently I had gotten it on DVD and watched it again and now I absolutely love it! Patrick and Jennifer look great together in this movie and I've already watched it so many times, and this is one movie that will never get boring to me...and those who haven't seen it...NEED to watch it! :D
B000084T18|4.0|I dont give this album 5 stars, because 50 can do it better (or he at least did better on &quot;Guess whos back&quot;). So I waited more from this album, but yeah, its good.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|This box set is amazing, and anything I say won't be extraordinarily fresh or new. However, for all those who were disappointed in Alien 3 (which is a vast majority it seems!) buy this OR atleast the new Alien 3 DVD on its own! <br />David Fincher's assembly cut totally re-invents the film, from even the first scene which was totally butchered and changed by Fox! The film is drastically better in the original state.  With 100 x more suspense and even more amazing visuals, the Assembly Cut is well worth the cost of the DVD and redeems itself as the perfect end (pre #4) to the series.
B0000A1RJI|3.0|Well, let's get the bad news out of the way first...<BR>Where this soundtrack lacks is in the quality of the recording...and while there are times when poor recording quality can be overlooked (if the tracks themselves are particulary good), this is not one of those.  Also, the lack of consistency in the way the tracks are presented on the album vs. their order in the movie is a bit annoying (but not unforgivable).  Lastly, there are pieces of the score missing that should have been included - if for no other reason but to lengthen the time of the soundtrack (I had nearly finished the entire CD just on my way to work this morning).<br />But there is good here too...<BR>The tempo of the music is fun and very lively - a good motivator in the morning.  The main themes will be stuck in your head all day.  Also, there are some really sensational tracks here.  You can visualize most, if not all, of the scenes in your head while listening - which is usually a plus for most listeners. <br />Would I recommend it?  Sure, it is a great accessory if you have seen the movie and enjoyed it.  But try to find it at a discounted rate (like Amazon) - avoid paying full price - not worth the extra few dollars.
0440539811|5.0|Live From Chapel Perilous<br />We're living in Robert Anton Wilson's world<br />Jesse Walker<br />In 1973 Thomas Pynchon published an enormous experimental novel called Gravity's Rainbow. In 1975 Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson published an enormous experimental trilogy called Illuminatus! Both were written at about the same time, and both offered panoramic perspectives on history, liberty, and paranoia.<br />Gravity's Rainbow won the National Book Award. Illuminatus! won no awards, save a science fiction prize issued a decade later. Gravity's Rainbow is often assigned in college classes. Illuminatus! might be required in some school somewhere, but such spots are surely few. Judging from anecdotal evidence, more people have started Gravity's Rainbow than Illuminatus! But far more people have finished Illuminatus! than Gravity's Rainbow.<br />Robert Anton Wilson is the unacknowledged elephant in our cultural living room: a direct and indirect influence on popular books, movies, TV shows, music, games, comics, and commentary. (His late co-author has left less of a mark: Many of Wilson's books have cult followings, while the only Shea effort to make a big splash was the trilogy he wrote with Wilson.) Allusions to Wilson's work appear in places both classy and trashy: There's a Wilsonian stamp on films as diverse as Magnolia, The Mothman Prophecies, and Sex and Lucia, and it's because of Wilson and Shea that the Illuminati, a secret society that once lurked only in right-wing conspiracy tracts, became the villains of Lara Croft, Tomb Raider. Now Wilson's the star of a lively documentary, Maybe Logic, that's being screened at film festivals and distributed on DVD.<br />Wilson is a primary source for the ironic style of conspiracism, a sensibility that treats alleged cabals not as intrigues to be exposed or lies to be debunked but as a bizarre mutant mythos to be mined for laughs, metaphors, and social insights. If you were an amused aficionado of conspiracy folklorein 1963, you were a lone hobbyist or specialist. By 1983, you could turn to a number of fanzines, comics, and weirdo institutions such as the Church of the SubGenius, a satiric cult founded by some Illuminatus! fans. By 1993, you were a target market for several half-joking mass-market conspiracy tomes; your sensibility was reflected regularly in magazines such as Mondo 2000 and The Nose; and two brand new pop juggernauts were about to enter your heart: The X-Files and the World Wide Web.<br />And by 2003, this was all standard background noise. These days, choosing your politics is a matter of choosing who you're more afraid of, the Washington cabal that's openly trying to erase your freedoms or the various foreign cabals that are openly trying to kill you. Like it or not, we're living in Robert Anton Wilson's world.<br />Illuminatus! did not invent this mental universe sui generis. But it was Illuminatus! that created the template, with its sprawling story that treated every interpretation of the world, paranoid or not, as equally plausible and equally ridiculous. And it was Wilson whose other novels and essays, from the historical fiction The Earth Will Shake to the autobiographical Cosmic Trigger, explored conspiracy theories not to expose \\"the truth\\" but to reveal the ways we construct strange stories out of the everyday truths we only hazily perceive.<br />This wasn't a purely abstract intellectual pursuit. In the early '70s, experimenting heavily with psychedelics and other forms of \\"deliberately induced brain change,\\" Wilson underwent a series of unusual...experiences. \\"Around 1973 I became convinced for a while that I was receiving messages from outer space,\\" he informs us in Maybe Logic. \\"But then a psychic reader told me that I was actually channeling an ancient Chinese philosopher. And another psychic reader told me I was channeling a medieval Irish bard. And at that time I started reading neurology and I decided it was just my right brain talking to myleft brain. And then I went to Ireland and discovered it was actually a six-foot-tall white rabbit -- they call it the pooka.\\"<br />A little later he comments, \\"I like the giant rabbit from County Kerry because there's no chance anyone will take that literally.\\"<br />Including yourself? asks the interviewer.<br />Wilson agrees. Then he adds, \\"Well, not too literally.\\" He glances over his shoulder. \\"Sorry about that, Harvey.\\"<br />If there's a central message to Wilson's work, the film tells us, it's the agnostic notion that you can't be completely certain about anything -- and that even when you're pretty sure an idea is baseless, it might be fun to entertain it for an evening. Somewhere between absolute belief and absolute incredulity, he tells us, the universe contains a maybe. To which anyone who follows the news these days can reply: No doubt.<br />Associate Editor Jesse Walker is the author of Rebels on the Air (NYU Press).
B00005JMGL|3.0|If you stick to the basic storyline of the original story of Peter Pan, and don't make a musical, it's hard to mess up making a movie.  And this movie did NOT mess up.  It was right on target.  It was entertaining for all ages.  It had action.  It was funny.  The special effects were updated a lot since the last Peter Pan movie was made.  They were very good, although they looked like something a kid would imagine (and that was the point).  I was sort of suprized at all of the pirates that got killed at the end of the movie, but they were bad anyway!  The only problem with this movie, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars, is that is dragged out way too much.  Even the action scenes seemed to go by very slowly, and slower romance scenes took forever.  And it wasn't just me saying this either.  The 2 people that I went to see the movie with both agreed with me that this was a problem in the movie.  <BR> <BR>Now after I buy the movie's great soundtrack I think I'm going to think some happy thoughts and fly to the second star to the right, and end up in Neverland.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I've always been a fan of britney, but this album isn't anything different from her others. I was expecting something more mature that aleast showed her growth from her last album. Its just \\"Britney\\" pt.2 with better beats. I wish this album would have showed her voice and brought some other subjects to the table other than just Sex! Partying!,and Drinking! Even though I must admit some songs are catchy,but yet her vocals are just Bad. If your lookin for an album with great beats, bad vocals, corny lyrics, and sad attempts at trying to make sensual songs then this is for you. But still I must admit there are maybe like 2 or 3 really good songs that is why it gets two stars.<br /> ME AGAINST THE MUSIC: We've all heard this one. Probably one of the better songs on the album. Could have been even more better without madonna! 5/10 <br /> I'VE GOT THAT BOOM BOOM:Great beats! Again would probably have been better if the ying yang twins weren't on this song. They get very annoying very fast. But it has okay lyrics and I guess okay vocals. 6/10<br /> SHOWDOWN: Good beats and the chorus is catchy. But a sorry attempt at sexual lyrics and a sensual song. 4/10 <br /> BREATH ON ME: Very kylie- like. She sounds like 8 year old, but I must admit great song. 9/10<br /> EARLY MORNIN:Great production on Moby's part,but again is a 8 year old singin this? 6/10<br /> TOXIC: Probably the only really great song on this album. 10/10<br /> OUTRAGEOUS: Horrible lyrics and horrible vocals to go with it.  1/10<br /> TOUCH OF MY HAND: The vocals could have been way better, but good beats. 6/10<br /> HOOKUP: Just no! britney! Just no! Just horrible! 1/10<br /> SHADOW: I wonder if Hilary duff turned this song down and she probably could have sang it better. 3/10<BR> <BR> BRAVE NEW GIRL:  Corny lyrics. 3/10<BR> <BR> EVERYTIME: Very overproduced and you can't even hear her. Is her voice there? 4/10<br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC(F. MADONNA)(RISHI RICH'S DESI KULCHA REMIX):  Great Remix! Should have released this instead of the orginal 9/10<BR>  <BR> Britney is right it is her against the music and now guess her voice as well.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I'm wondering to myself why i've never heard of this artist before. I've def. been missing out, and really regret it. DeGraw is a very very talented artist that makes beautiful and classic music. I first heard him, while searching online and listening to music samples, and as soon as the oppurtunity arose to pick up his CD i jumped to it. His melodic voice and beautiful harmonies are those that make you love singer-songwriters for what they are worth. I def. recommend this CD to anyone who wants great music to fill their atmosphere. You won't be disappointed.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is an amazing album with great songs, incredible lyrics, and a stunning voice to match. I was never a christina fan in her teen pop days nor in her 'dirrty' days. But after giving this album a try, I could see the amount of RAW talent she really has in her. Get past her image or whatever else that you don't like about her and really focus on the most important thing which is the music. Each song as a message that people can relate too and it shows how really diverse she is (pop/rock/r&b/hiphop/soul/dance/Gospel/ballad/ heck even country). Songs that touch on many subjects such as being your own person, being strong, finding your own path, loving yourself for who you are, and many more. Its like each song is a chapter in her life where at one point she has expierenced and gone through which makes it even more relatable. She co-wrote, co-produced, arranged, and executive produced this great album which impressed me. It really shows how she has grown as a person and more so into an Artist.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Alicia Keys def. brings it in her latest effort. The songs included on this disc are what we would expect from such a talented artist. The songs are heartfelt and sung with dedication. I give props to Ms. Keys for bringing this talented effort and not leaving me disappointed. Fav. song #6 and #11
B000002UB6|5.0|I was very happy to see that The Beatles last and most unfairly judged album recently made number eighty-six on Rolling Stone Magazines List of the 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time, especially since over the years some less intelligent Rock 'n' Roll fans have dubbed this the Beatles worst album, wich is tragically untrue.<br />One lie that the haters of this album have spread, is that The Beatles hated it, false, John and George loved it and were very happy with Phil Spectors production work (and in fact invited him to produce some of their best solo projects), it was Paul who hated the production, as it was with everything at the time, Paul would always squabble with John and George, and Ringo was trapped in the middle (Ringo was always the peacekeeper of the group). A redo of this album, entitled 'Let It Be... Naked' was released late last year, if you're not sure exactly what this is, I'll give you an overview, 'Let It Be... Naked' is basically Paul removing all of John and George's creative input from the album, and making it exactly what he wanted all along, it's him trying to beat them after all these years (unfortunetely they can't do anything about it now). I think the only reason this album has gotten such a bad rap is that the Paul fans hear him trash it and end up listening to it with a biased ear, then the psuedo-intelectuals hear that it's their worst album and dislike it simply because of what they've been told.<br />This is actually the Beatles most honest and tender album, it shows them in their truest form as a fun Rock 'n' Roll band, and above all, it has some of their all-time best songs, including Paul's lovely piano ballads 'Let It Be' and 'The Long and Winding Road' and his raw rock 'n' roll song 'Get Back', John's R&amp;B romp 'Dig A Pony' and his beautiful acoustic cry 'Across The Universe', George's meaninful 'I Me Mine' and bluesy 'For You Blue', there are also wonderful John and Paul collaborations in 'Two Of Us', 'One After 909' and 'I'veGot A Feeling'. Another big upside this album has is that it is almost impossible to put it in without listening to the entier thing, there are few albums that accomplish that.<br />I hope I've convinced you to go with this album instead of the new remix, wether you like this or not, you can't just go back in time and do it differently, cause it can't be made any better, best is the moment, and 'Let It Be' captures a defining moment in the Beatles career.<br />One last thing, another reviewer I read in here said that The Stones had &quot;much more staying power than the Beatles&quot;, when I read that, I just had to laugh, don't get me wrong, I love the Stones, but really think about it, the Beatles broke up over thirty years ago, and still remain on top, the Stones have continued to tour to this day and STILL remain second to the Beatles, if your personal opinion is that the Stones are better than the Beatles, that's fine, but keep in mind that most of the world disagrees with you, and there's no reason to be bitter about it.
B000002JKA|5.0|I have just recently started listening to DT, I was amazed by DT albums such as 6DIF, SFM, ACOS, and I&amp;W. I would not recomend any others, FII, is a waste of effort. However Awake is the best album of I have heard, I put it on my CD player on repeat and listen to it over and over again. This is the only album I was ever able to do that with. I would describe DT as a band to be most like a cross between Pink Floyd and G&amp;R with a little bit of Metallica thrown in, its awsome. As far as this album. The best song DT ever did was Voices and the Second best is Silent Man and they are both on this album. The third best is Anna Lee and the forth is Innocense Fadded. They are all on this album and all the best top best songs DT ever did. <br />I am a musician and many musicians can learn a lot about music a theory by listening to this album. I am not just some nut job(no pun intended) writing a review, the above review is based on musical fact not opion. If you are gonna give Amazon your money you might as well spend it on something worthwile. Buy this album right now, you wont regret it
B00008PW2D|5.0|Once again HBO did an amazing job with the 5'th season of Sex and the City. This is shorter than usual, however, it is worth the money.

I  strongly agree with their 5 star ratings.<BR>this movie doesn't pull any punches when it comes to violence, but at the same time it's  also a social commentary regarding violence within today's high schools, (especially in america)and the bad bridge between the generation gap.<br />beat takashi (brother) does a great portrayal as the sadistic teacher/controller KITARO. BR has influences from previous american flicks like the running man, lord of the flies,escape from new york and fortress (the necklace bomb &quot;wedlock&quot;) <br />what's disturbing is watching those cute japanese kids get slaughtered in so many ways(shootings,hackings,slashings,poison etc.) that it almost resembles a virtual videogame. <BR>the ending i felt was anti climatic, but the flashback sequences adds much depth to the characters. too bad most americans will NEVER get to see this DVD Gem because of the contriversial content, but if ever there was a us adaptation like THE RING, director paul verhooven(robocop,starship troopers) would be my first choice and/or maybe quinten tarantino just as long as he doesn't make a cameo appearance like he did in his previous movies.<br />BATTLE ROYAL; one of the best movies &quot;made in japan&quot;.
B00006L90T|5.0|Fantastic, if you are looking for a spooky film to watch with selected gothic company non come more highly recomened than this.<BR>Your spine will tingle from reckless opening to mind bending climax.<BR>This film is beatifully atmospheric filled with church organ music that would make La,Vey proud.<BR>Open some wine and allow youself to descend into sunny madness.
B000094DUP|5.0|I bought this album 6 months ago, and haven't stopped listning to it!<BR> Delta proves that she is no 'one-hit-wonder' by releasing five Number 1 singles, and a number 1 record!<br />Delta shows she can also sing in a variety of ways from the country sounding &quot;in My Own Time&quot; to the more pop sound of &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;<BR>This is a must have album!
B00008DDSC|4.0|At the root, at the heart of this film, is a chick flick.  A very good chick flick.  Sure like most other reviewers, I'll agree that it's not for everyone.  If you have a hard time understanding a lifestyle that differs from your own, not a movie for you.  Unless your lifestyle involves your average S&amp;M activities, then definately movie for you.  Or if you're just open minded.  I guess this film gave me a better understanding of someone who is into S&amp;M and I actually respect their motives.  It's all about happiness.  And this film really showed this and did a great job at it.  James Spader acted really well in this, but was definately overshadowed by Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She impressed me beyond words.
B0000C1733|3.0|I'm not a huge Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, but I have enjoyed their music over the years. With all of the band's releases and familiar hits, I knew it would be a matter of time, if not years, before they would finally come out with a greatest hits album. And they have, with this release.<br />I first learned about this Cd through a t.v. advertisement. As the person narrating finished running through the tracks, I realized that \\"Can't Stop,\\" \\"Around The World,\\" and \\"The Zephyr Song,\\" weren't mentioned. Thinking it must be some kind of mistake on my part, and hoping that it was, I went online and scrolled through the tracks, and to much disbelief and dismay, there was no mistake. <br />The Red Hot Chili Peppers had finally managed to come out with a classic, greatest hits album, and like so many other bands when it comes to greatest hits Cd's, had managed to leave out at least three of their greatest songs. Not only did the Chili Peppers leave out these classics, but they introduce to the public two new songs, \\"Fortune Faded,\\" and \\"Save The Population,\\" one of which actually belongs on this Cd (Fortune Faded). The band completely dumped three classics that helped keep them at the top of their game, to introduce new material on the album. Why they did this and why other bands do the same thing, I'll never, ever understand.<br />As you can tell, I'm dissapointed and confused about this Cd, the chosen tracks, the absence of \\"certain\\" songs. Why do bands leave out 1 or 2 great hits on greatest hits albums? Do they forget about them? Maybe the members of these bands aren't as fond about them as the rest of the country.<br />Anyway, If you're a Peppers fan, you can get most of their great hits on this Cd. But for myself, I can't get this cd and live with the fact that those tracks are missing from the album. I give this release a three out of a possible five stars for the amount of great hits this Cd contains. However, this album misses out on what would have been two more stars for the fact that those tracks I mentioned were missing.
6304779356|4.0|Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric hit big with Joel Schumacher's vampire cult classic from the 80's.  Already proving himself as a talent for the cocky bad-boy, Sutherland delivers a solid performance as the teenage leader of the vampires.  And Jason Patric in his second and arguably best film plays the role of Michael.  Michael, his mother, and younger brother are the new family in a town full of vampires.  Michael falls for Star(Jamie Gertz), a female vampire.  In turn, Sutherland's David instead of killing Michael changes him into a vampire.  The story revolves around Michael struggling with becoming fully vampire and his younger brother's quest to save him with help from Edgar and Alan Frog, the former played by Corey Feldman, who are self-proclaimed vampire hunters.  While some may consider the script and acting a bit juvenille and quirky, this movie captures the attention of any vampire fan and holds it until the end. I have thouroghly enjoyed this movie for several years and fully recommend adding it to your collection.

B00012QM8G|5.0|\\"Schindler's List\\" is, beyond question, one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. Profoundly sad and incredibly well-acted, it's the best Holocaust drama ever made, deserving of every accolade it's received since its release in 1994 - where it became a box-office hit despite its time length, black-and-white cinematography and bleak subject matter.<br />I'm incredibly glad this is finally going to be released on DVD, and I would hope that it would be a staple of most serious filmgoers' collections.<br />But there's something about \\"Schindler's List\\" that a friend of mine once pointed out to me.<br />Certainly, it's great, but how many times can you watch it? It's a difficult, if important, film experience, and my friend asked me why I would want to own it. It's not one of those movies that you can really, dare I use the term, \\"enjoy.\\"<br />I doubt anyone's said, \\"Hey, it's raining. Let's watch SCHINDLER'S LIST again! That'll be fun!\\"<br />When I saw it in theaters with my father, he said it was an amazing film, and he hoped never, ever to have to watch it again because of the profound impact it has. I own a VHS copy of it, and I sadly have never been able to sit through it in its entirety. It's too harrowing.<br />Ben Kingsley, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Embeth Davidtz are really good in the film, but it's not a film that you can detach yourself from and admire from a distance - even to admire the tremendous skill and dedication of everyone involved in the project.<br />Though it's amazing, you are put in a really uncomfortable emotional place while watching \\"Schindler's List,\\" and it's not an easy experience many people are willing to endure more than once.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|This movie is fabulous, as it flawlessly portrays the drama, the complexities and, most importantly, the beauty of love. The director seamlessly weaves in and out of the tales of relationships of several different couples. <br />Joan and Keenan are young fledgling lovers who meet in a nightclub under rather humourous, unique and intriguing circumstances. <br />Meredith and Trent are battling with the issues involved in middle-aged dating and how to overcome past demons.  <br />Hannah and Paul have been married for years, and are now confronting a crucial turning-point in their not-so-perfect marriage. <br />Mildred and Mark, a mother-and-son pairing, tear-jerkingly come to terms with the reality of a terminal illness. <br />Gracie and Roger are using sexual compatibility to disguise emotional loneliness. <br />And Hugh disguises emotional loneliness in a different way - he ventures out into the world, trying to make something of himself using the only talent he knows.<br />In essence, the director is to be commended for his skilled use of cinematography, dialogue and music to portray the funny, tender, dramatic and often brutally honest side of love, in all its forms. The actors are by no means amateurs, and bring both depth and realism to their roles.<br />Overall, most people would be hard-pressed to find flaw with this film. Women and teenage girls will revel in the romance. Men will probably be amused and entertained by the honesty and humour portrayed. And any sentimental soul will probably shed a tear here or there, as they experience the subtle power of this film.<br />Starring Angelina Jolie, Ryan Phillippe, Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, Jay Mohr, Dennis Quaid, Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Edwards, this film is rated M15+, but in terms of sexual references and occasional coarse language, it would probably be considered an R on the net. However, any mature teenager under the age of 15 could handle it.<br />It's difficult to findfault with this movie, and the unexpected twists and turns and ultimate unexpected (or perhaps expected, for the more perceptive) linking of characters will leave you stunned and, I believe, moved.<br />This film is refreshing, honest, full of vitality, warmth, humour and tenderness that will leave almost everybody satisfied.<br />P.S Please write to the producers if you know where to find them - beg them to release the DVD in Australia. It's tearing me apart! It's one of my favourite movies.
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|Other cd direct to the garbage... please don't buy this cd of a pseudo group of rich and silly boys. aarghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!
B000002JPA|1.0|Oh my God, I cannot believe what I am reading.  <br />I bought this record based on the reviews here on Amazon.  BIG mistake.  If I had the opportunity to see the inside jacket of the CD, with photos of the band in their big-hair I probably would have known better.  They say looks can be deceiving, but when I saw one of the guys sporting a full-on Kenny G hairdo while wearing suspenders and no shirt, I knew I was in trouble.<br />I will not criticize this band's ability.  Technically, they are very fine \\"instrument players.\\"  I don't consider them musicians because not a single thing they do evokes any sort of feeling or emotion.  This is music for people who are impressed by how FAST someone can play, not how well they can create.  <br />This is utter garbage, meant for perpetually adolescent fanboys who started off liking Poison but now consider themselves mature and intelligent enough to listen to bands THEY think have musical skill.  The pompous, pseudo-intellectual posturing combined with their fashion show preening makes this group a joke.<br />Dream Theater is everything that's wrong with rock and roll.  I bought it expecting something along the likes of Yes or King crimson.  What I got was Nerd rock, made especially for the guys who aren't aware that they are actually nerds.  It's like Rush, if Rush took themselves completely seriously and thought themselves to be the musical geniuses of all time.  The difference being that Rush actually made some good musical statements and were very creative for a long period of time.  This is just crap.  <br />I would use this CD as a coaster if I wasn't convinced that it would infect my coffee table with SUCK.<br />Would that I could give it ZERO stars.
B00009V7T2|5.0|When I listen to Mars Volta, I think, If only more bands could pull this off.  The talent these guys have is matched by few in the rock world, and the aesthic quality these guys bring to music is something that most bands would kill for.  <BR>The vocals are probably the stand out.  They're just ice.  Even from back in the ATDI days, he had some immense talent, and it just keeps on growing.  Pick this album up, and you won't regret it, even if you don't like &quot;emo&quot;.  But, be prepared for some extremely esoteric lyrics.  Keep you minds and ears open on this one, and you'll be pleased.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is amazing.  Incredible.  It is worthy of endless superlatives.  I rented the DVD for my daughter and wound up sitting transfixed at what I was witnessing.  Maybe the creator got hold of some slightly toxic puffer fish, because the concepts in this film are so bizarre and wonderful that I think they MUST have been hallucinogenically induced.<br />This is now on my Must-Buy list, but not for my kids- for me.  Had this film been available to me when I was twenty years younger, and still experimenting with mind-altering substances, I may have watched it every single day.  It is transforming.  I love movies that transport me to another realm, and few are able to do that.<br />The spirit baths, the herbal soap tokens, No-Face, the tiny fuzzy black ball creatures that bring Sen her shoes, the wonderfully creative and strange characters, all of it combines for an experience I won't ever forget.<br />If you don't like this film, you were ripped off.  Someone stole your creative soul.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|What can I say about a band that hasn't already been said before by so many? Even stripped down back to its basics, the reissue of &quot;Let It Be&quot; in its new &quot;Naked&quot; form shows the power of the Beatles at their best...and unfortunately their worst, given all the problems that would lead to their untimely break-up. Some of these versions of the songs that we are familiar with are slightly different - case in point: &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; as presented here has some different arrangements and wording as opposed to the classic original and its &quot;naked&quot; original on &quot;Anthology III&quot;. But after 33 years, we finally got the album we wanted as it was meant to be heard, and for that we are forever grateful.
B00008PW2D|3.0|Ok, the folks at HBO publishing are getting greedy.  Season 5 was only 8 episodes.  So in HBO's infinite wisdom they decided to charge us fans the same list price as a 24-episode season, with no extras worth mentioning.  (However they do split it up onto 2 DVD's to make you think you're getting more for your money.)<BR>While the shows are great I have to ding this season with 3 stars because of the blatant disregard for loyal consumers.  <BR>In season 5 we have Carrie being free and single, Miranda dealing with the baby and Steve, Samantha dealing with Richard, and Charlotte in life after Trey.  <BR>If you're a junky/collector I guess you'll end up purchasing it like me, otherwise send a message to HBO and just rent it.
B0000033OZ|4.0|Their classic first lp reissued on CD,originally released in 1970.Some refer to this as their 'Dove Album' because it's cover is graced with an image of a dove.Most often played tunes here are &quot;Knife Edge&quot; and their signature tune &quot;Lucky Man&quot;.I also enjoyed the three-part composition of the classically-arranged &quot;The Three Fates&quot;.Also good to hear is &quot;Tank&quot; which I believe they still perform on tour,when they headline.Any true fan of the progressive genre should have a copy of this disc.
0385512104|4.0|Hurrah! The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time just won the Whitbread award for best novel of the year!<br />This impressive little book is quite unique, and I really want to give it 5 stars for sheer chutzpah and genious. But I do have a couple qualms with it that require me to give it only 4. <br />First, the voice and perspective make the narrator jump off the page. Here's a great example: <br />&quot;This is what Siobahn says is called a rhetorical question. It has a question mark at the end, but you are not meant to answer it because the person answering it already knows the answer. It is difficult to spot a rhetorical question.&quot;<br />And here's another:<br />&quot;I think [metaphor] should be called lie because a pig is not like a day and people do not have skeletons in their cupboards. And when I try and make a picture of the phrase in my head it just confuses me because imagining an apple in someone's eye doesn't have anything to do with liking someone a lot and it makes you forget what the person was talking about.&quot;<br />The autistic narrator's struggles with any nonliteral use of language (including metaphor, irony, sarcasm, etc.) reminded me much of Jonathan Safran Foer's narrator in Everything Is Illuminated, who simply can't seem to grasp the nuance of idiom in English, his second language. This risky style makes both books incredibly compelling, but, for me, it also makes both books ultimately a little disappointing, perhaps inevitably.<br />In all, Haddon does a remarkable job of maintaining this difficult device without it becoming too forced or tiresome. (However, I was glad that the book was short. I'm not sure how much longer it could stay fresh and interesting.) This unique voice and perspective provides an interesting access to the story and naturally highlights significant developments in the plot, which might otherwise have slipped right by unnoticed. <br />The downside of this perspective is that it is heartbreaking to spend a whole book with a character who can't actually feel (or at least express) the emotions that I, as a reader, require for a completely satisfying story. Though there is some resolution at the end of the book, I couldn't help feel the disconcerting paradox that a) the narrator never authentically feels or understands the motivations of the people who love him (or even what love itself is, aside from protection and providing food) or his own emotional response to problems that befall him and his family, and yet b) he is obviously affected by these complex issues, yet he never really comes to terms with them. <br />In the end, I felt the most empathy for the boy's father, who feels the weight of everything enough for both him and his son. I'm sure I'm not explaining this well at all. As I say, perhaps this dissatisfaction is inevitable, given the structure of the book. Perhaps it's built into the book to show how hard autism is on the families. I guess I just wanted, just once, to hear the narrator be able to say, &quot;That made me feel sad.&quot; That would have been enough resolution for me.<br />A final aside: after the narrator states early on in the book that &quot;this is a murder mystery novel,&quot; I was mildly disappointed a few pages later to discover that it actually was not a murder mystery novel. Of course, my reaction isn't really a criticism of the book. For the most part, after I realized what was going on, I liked the precedent that this deception set and was happy to be led by the narrator throughout the rest of the book, even if (perhaps especially because) he couldn't be trusted to give me the whole story.
0684857219|5.0|Not only is this book a GREAT training aid, It inspires you into working harder and better at the gym. <br />Whenever I hit a low patch I find Arnold's beautifully arrogant writing style just re-ignites my fire and im off down the gym with a renewed passion.<br />It instructs clearly on exercise form, and workout routines from the very beginning of your training right up to competetion routines. It is very simple and easy to understand, yet, it goes into so much detail should you need it, for example, there is a section advising on shape of Posing trunks.... :-\<br />Without a doubt Arnold was the greatest bodybuilder of his time, and is still even now the most famous and respected man in the business.<br />Buy this book and learn from the greatest.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Some songs on the album can be repetitive and unintereting, but there are some gems that make this album well worth buying, such as haunting 2+2=5. <br />It's different, but it's great.
B00005JM02|5.0|I'd wanted to see this movie for a long time, but was extremely busy when it was in the theater and couldn't go.  I was thrilled when it came out on DVD.<br />The beginning of the movie was a bit of a shock for me, as none of my friends who had seen the movie warned me. (But it's okay...the movie has a happy ending! :c) )<br />Nemo is so cute with his lucky fin and he reminds me of human children who want to push the envelope with their parents. This is a movie the most people are going to enjoy.  I could definitely watch it again!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought this cd because Gavin Degraw sings the theme song to one of my favorite shows.  I bought the cd not knowing any of the other songs.  It's one of my favorite cd's.  Great lyrics.  Great sound.  Great voice.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I have only seen parts of the first two 'Terminator' movies, so there was some of the history that I missed out on.  However, I watched this with a friend who filled me in as the movie progressed.<br />I was 99% sure that I wasn't going to like this movie, but I was surprised.  Though it's not on my Top 10 list, it was a good movie.<br />The stunts are spectacular, especially at the beginning of the movie.  The ending definitely leaves a lot of room for a &quot;Terminator 4&quot;.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I gotta say I am disappointed in some of these reviews attacking Alicia's \\"attitude\\" and lack of talent. Its kinda ridiculous, especially if you really listened to this album. This Cd is soooo good. Its great actually. This album is soulful, sexy, intense, real, unique... Need I say more? The lyrics are so emotional and deep. I love how she takes you through a journey from the 1960s to now with out skipping a beat. She is definitely a talented young lady. She bridges the gap between old soul and new soul allowing our generation to really appreciate older music from that era. <BR>My favorite tracks are Karma, Heartburn- So funky and different,please keep a open mind with this song, you will love it. Ofcourse You dont know my name, If I aint got you- I love this song so much, its a beautiful ballad, the emotion of her voice is intoxicating. Diary is really nice laid back song feat Tony Toni Tone, Dragon Days is a sexy sensual song about missing someone, one of my favorites. Wake up is a song that sounds like a straight thowback song of the sixties- very soulful. When you really love someone is like A Womans Worth part 2, yet fresh and nice- I love it. I even love the interlude- Feeling me feeling you- reaaly nice. Slow down sounds more of a radio r&B song but has a great message and still is a great song.<BR>This is a Cd that you sit in the tub with some scented candles and just groove to or listen to while you driving- either way, Its a really good CD. I definitely recommend this to anyone!!!1 <br />For those who dont like the album, please listen to it a few times more... dont give up on this album. I guarentee you will fall in love with it too, if not then its obvious you dont know music and definitely lacking soul in your life!!!
B00005JL2O|3.0|I was sick over New Years, so I watched this movie with a friend. I haven't yet seen the first movie, but I've seen the second, so I kind of knew the jist of the \\"Austin Powers\\" movies.<br />This one features a lot of the same jokes, most of which have just been rehashed from the previous movies.  Same basic scenario: Austin travels back in time to save the world, meets up with some girl, and they team up to save the world together.<br />Though this movie did have strong sexual themes, they weren't quite as strong as those in \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\".<br />The first part of the movie with Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, etc. was hilarious.  I think that was surely one of the funniest parts of the movie.<br />If you are having a relaxing night at home, this movie will give you a couple of good laughs.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a great book. It depicts the adventure of a boy who is called to be trained to be a soldier in a school in outer space. Orson Scott Card uses great detail in this book; he uses so much in fact that you feel as if you are the main character, Ender Wiggin. While I was reading this book I could feel what Ender and his friends were feeling. Ender is being trained to fight the third alien war against earth and he is learning how he can use zero gravity to his advantage. Although he faces problems during his time at battle school, he never gives up. This is one of the first books I have ever been able to sit and read for hours on end. I would really encourage young adults and people with good imaginations to read this book.
B00003CXCW|2.0|This movie is very dated.  Not only that, but it was boring.  You can tell that this was done on a shoestring budget because the film is made in black in white.  These days, you make movies in color unless you're really strapped for funds.  Sundance won't even consider your movie if it's done in black and white.  It just looks cheap and it won't fly with most audiences today.  I'd normally give this just one star, but I'm giving it two because of that funny line, &quot;I'm ready for my close up!&quot;  I'm not really sure what that meant or what it had to do with the rest of the movie, but it made me laugh.  But the movie's poor production and the fact that it's in black and white forces me to give it just two stars.  Sorry.
B0000524EM|5.0|The Crow is a truly beautiful movie, with a wonderful story line, and just twisted enough to spark my interest. That got me to see the other two, which are not as good but not bad either. Each movie has just enough of the goth sense, to really allow me to enjoy it, so if you're into that sort of thing, the crow is definately for you. Its a much treasured element that gives me a new and different look on the world. (BUY THIS SET!)
0345452577|2.0|The main characters were all people, if I met them in actual life, I would do my best to avoid if I had a choice--either boring or worse.  When Jeremy first observed the elegant dining club located in the strangely abandoned warehouse district, I thought I was in some King/horror clone.  The story just never got moving, either in plot or character development.<br />Maybe Jonathan needs some advise from his wife Faye.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah turns in a piano record that is marvelous and improves with every listen.  A lot of people came out complaining that the songs all sound the same.  While it's true they due sound similar, it's only in terms of the production, and it's deliberate because the CD has very melancholy themes.  The arrangements and songs themselves are as diverse as any Sarah has done, though it's true they are all piano based.  And who doesn't love that?  Drifting and Train Wreck are highlights!
B000002V07|5.0|This is the perfect cd to listen to when you are making love, when you are high, when you are driving, when you are drunk, when you are tired, when you just want to unwind... and even when you are in the gym.<br />The music is WONDERFUL, Hope's voice is crystal clear, the guitars are sooooo amazing, I just love this cd. Especially &quot;Fade into you&quot; and &quot;Five String Serenade&quot;
B00003XAQ5|5.0|This SACD version increases your listening pleasure by a factor of 2 over the plain CD version.
0783117523|5.0|I loved this movie the very first time I watched it, and even though I love Angelina, the storyline, the cast, and everything about it.... I must say the things that made me want to watch this movie over and over is just how emotional the movie is.<br />I get inspiration when I am painting by watching this movie. This is one of those artistically beautiful movies that you can pause on any given moment and be able to paint the most beautiful picture on canvas.<br />Angelina is flawlessly gorgeous when she is all made up... and even when she is given the &quot;drugged up&quot; look - she still has you completely captivated.<br />This is a fantastic movie, the cinematography is great, the writing is RIGHT ON, and the account of Gia is truly memorable.
B00005K3O4|4.0|Best:<br />1) The theme song is VERY catchy. You may not be able to get it out of your head for a long time.<BR>2) The movie was both funny and fun to watch, not to mention very colorful.<BR>3) They covered about every way a clown (remembering that they're really aliens from another planet that just look that way) can capture or kill somebody in a humorous, circus-type way.<BR>4) There's a host of special features from the funny filmmakers that go into great detail about the movie.<br />Worst:<br />1) Most of the time you can tell it's a low budget movie (although some effects looked expensive).<BR>2) If clowns (even if you spell it klowns) scare you, these guys won't help you warm up to them.<br />Recommendation:<br />This is a cult classic (or kult klassic) and you'll probably end up watching it way more than once. The abundance of behind-the-scenes stuff makes this DVD one that you'll want to take to your leader - now, I command you.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I LOVE sarah..... but this one tops them all!<br />I unwrapped the cd, put it into my cd player in the car, turned the volume up... and started to drive...<br />and I hear her singing - crystal clear - LIVE with fans screaming, and her voice couldn't be more perfect, her music couldn't be more rich, I was mesmorized.<br />I have now listened to this cd so many times that I would gnaw off my right arm to make sure no one would borrow this from me. This is a MUST HAVE in any collection. I looove this cd and trust me, you will too!
B00009XITQ|1.0|This movie was one of the worst I've seen, with a cheesy, overly predictable plot and amateur acting.  It also portrays Americans as clumsy and brash and the British as overly pompous and unaffectionate, which was a disappointment.  The movie is clearly aimed for female &quot;teenie-boppers&quot; between 8 and 12 years of age, and is highly annoying to anyone else who attempts to watch this garbage.  Just pass it up and don't waste your time.
B000002KBU|5.0|This was my very first introduction to Joni's music, and I fell in love with it. The songwriting is wonderful, her voice is addictive, and the music is passionate. I particularly liked the songs &quot;Little Green&quot; and &quot;River&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; which stick with me...<br />Joni was the original to folk music with this type of magnitude, and although I must say I enjoy music by Sarah McLachlan and Jewel and other more modern day -- I still thoroughly enjoyed this one. I know that Joni still makes music to this day, but this cd -- THIS CD is definitely the one that sticks out the most and really truly shows her at her best. I highly recommend it.
B000003RCY|5.0|alot of peaple when they hear German music they say it sucks without even knowing what it means or waiting for the climax in the sing. i say rammstein is good and addictive. their albums are one of my favorite albums overall.
B00004STPT|5.0|As much as I enjoyed the music on \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", the Oscar for best original score really should have gone to \\"Gladiator\\" but at least it won best movie. I'm real picky when it comes to soundtracks because I tend to skip several sections until I actually hear something I like (for the most part the instruments merely serve as background noise, anyway) but I can easily listen to this from start to finish, and without missing a single beat. From the dramatic strings that seem to cry to the Heavens (or to the Gods) on \\"The Battle\\" to the more somber pieces that mostly evoke sadness with visions of death that are toned down and eerily haunting, every song is mesmerizing in their own particular way and they all bring back memories from the film. Hans Zimmer captures the mood perfectly and the wonderful contributions of multi-faceted singer/composer Lisa Gerrard from the now defunct but never forgotten Dead Can Dance on \\"Elysium, \\"Honor Him\\", and the gorgeous, soul-stirring \\"Now We Are Free\\" (among others) are chilling yet achingly beautiful.<br />Although I've been wanting this incredible soundtrack for what seems like forever, I just now received this today and would like to thank a special someone in my life who keeps showering me with Christmas and birthday gifts since they're so close together :-). I'm happy to finally have this in my collection...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched the show, but she didn't. She got me the DVD for Christmas (before it sold out luckily) and she's watched them with me. She's not really into Sci-Fi (nor am I particularly) but even she loves the show and can't wait to see more.
