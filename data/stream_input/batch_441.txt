0671042858|5.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was a great book that I'd recommend<br /><br />to anyone. I love books about kids, and the 9-year-old main character in this book was a real spunky girl who reminded  me a<br /><br />lot of myself at that age.<br /><br />  It all starts when a divorced woman takes her 2 kids<br /><br />on a hike in the Appalachian trail. The son and mother argue the<br /><br />whole time. When the girl gets tired of the fighting, she goes off by herself, and accidentally gets lost.<br /><br />  With what little she carries in her backpack, including, an egg, a tuna sandwich,a bottle of surge, a bottle of<br /><br />water,celery sticks, 2 twinkies, and a walkman she struggles to manage alone in the woods for several days. When she is found she is in a different state. Her love of baseball helped her to get through this.<br /><br />  I wish King wrote more books like this. I prefer<br /><br />it to the fantasy I find in his other books. This reviewer gives<br /><br />this book a high score of 5 stars:)
0446530891|1.0|Just a thank you note to the reviewers:  you have saved me from wasting my money on this book.  Many thanks for your honest and insightful comments.
0385336810|4.0|I loved the Shopaholic series, so when I saw this book at my library, I had to read it. I finished it in about 4 hours and I don't do that often...it was so enjoyable that I could not put it down! <br /> <br />I could see a lot of myself in the main character, Emma, who is a young professional in a company where she doesn't get a lot of credit for the things that she does. Emma was easy to relate to and Kinsella's writing style makes this a breezy read. There were some things that were a little too predictable, but the author makes sure that even through that, there are still a lot of laughs.
0671027344|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend...Hes much like me and said that I would love it cause he could relate to it and I would be able to also. Well, I ordered the book at my book store and it took a month to come in...but believe me, it was worth the wait. The way I could relate to the book was uncany. I can't put into words how much I loved this book...I didn't want it to end...but sadly, it did.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Over the past few years, I have found very little that it worth spending money on coming out of the recording industry.  However, as a die-hard Sarah McLachlan fan, I can tell you that 'Afterglow' is worth several times it's weight in gold, even for casual Sarah fans or those who have never really been exposed to her music. <br /> <br />I really have a hard time deciding now which album I would consider her best release; since the release of 'Afterglow' it's been a toss-up between that and Fumbling Toward Ecstasy.  In any case, all of her albums (with the possible exception of 'Touch' due to it's outdated musical focus) are works of art, and 'Afterglow' is certainly no exception. <br /> <br />Check out track number 8, 'Time'; in my opinion it's the best song she has ever written.
B000286RKW|3.0|\\"Goodfellas\\", director Martin Scorsese's 1990 gangster epic, left an indelible impression on audiences and filmmakers, plunging them into the life of Henry Hill, a small-time New York thug who rose to the top of opulent mob life.  Much like Scorsese's landmark films of the seventies and eighties, \\"Goodfellas\\" produced new narrative and stylistic techniques which are apparent in modern classics like \\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Goofellas\\" was released on DVD shortly after the format launched in 1997.  For the last seven years, the only available copy of \\"Goodfellas\\" has been a wretched, two-sided, featureless DVD.  With so many bad movies available in redone, repackaged, and bloated special editions, fans of the movie have crying for an updated, feature-packed version of Scorsese's classic.  The \\"Goodfellas\\" Two-Disc Special Edition was finally released on August 17, but is the new version worth buying? <br /> <br />The new DVD has remarkably improved picture quality, something that should please everyone, whether they care about the extras or not.  The washed out, grainy look of the original DVD has been completely redone, replaced by a vibrant, pristine transfer.  The sound was thankfully remastered as well; dialogue and music are now properly balanced with each other, so you can watch the film at a consistent sound level without the annoyance of jarring, overloud music and gunshots after a scene of quiet talking. <br /> <br />The special features are the most alluring part of the new edition, but they are not as interesting as I had hoped.  The first disc contains two audio commentaries.  Martin Scorsese, Lorraine Bracco, Ray Liotta, Paul Sorvino, Frank Vincent, writer Nicholas Pileggi, editor Elma Shoonmaker, cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, and producers Irwin Winkler and Barbara De Fina participate in the first commentary.   <br /> <br />While the commentary has an impressive list of names, I cared more for what Scorsese and Liotta had to say than any of the other people.  I was also disappointed that Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci did not participate.  People who are interested in the technical aspects of the movie might appreciate the comments made by the cinematographer and the editor, but the first commentary was boring as a whole.  Scorsese can talk all day about anything regarding film, and I am surprised they didn't give him his own commentary track. <br /> <br />The second audio commentary features the real life gangster Henry Hill (whom Ray Liotta's character is based on) and FBI agent Edward McDonald.  Hill's observations are fantastic; he compares scenes in the movie to his own experiences, and hearing him talk about killings and drug deals is startling.   <br /> <br />The disappointing second disc contains the rest of the extras.  The longest feature, \\"Getting Made\\", runs thirty minutes, and contains interviews with most of the cast, who do little more than praise Martin Scorsese.   <br /> <br />\\"The Workaday Gangster\\" is an eight-minute segment with Henry Hill talking about the all day job of being a gangster.  It's just a rehash of everything he says on his audio commentary. <br /> <br />\\"The Goodfellas Legacy\\" is the most interesting feature on the second disc.  Frank Darabont, Richard Linklater, Jon Favreau, the Hughes brothers and Antione Fuqua discuss how the movie influenced their own films. <br /> <br />The remaining extras are the trailer and \\"Paper Is Cheaper Than Film\\", the latter being a trite three minute segment about Scorsese's preproduction notes and drawings. <br /> <br />If you own the 1997 copy of \\"Goodfellas\\", and you're not completely in awe of the movie, there's little reason to buy the Special Edition.  If you have never seen the film, make sure to watch the new edition, as the improved sound and transfer is a substantial improvement over the original.   <br /> <br />Only collectors or adulating fans of the movie should spend the twenty bucks for this disappointing update to one of the best films of the 90s.
B0002KQNL8|1.0|Note: The 1-star rating refers to this release, NOT the film itself.    This is by far not the best zombie film ever created. As a matter of fact it is not one of the best horror films ever created. It is a shadow compared to the original, which is completely hysterical, has very likable characters, yet is serious enough to create solid tension with a sense of forboding doom. Quite simply put, the original has become a masterpiece of 80's cinema. What Return II is, actually, is a slick-looking, cheesey 80's kiddie horror/comedy with good production values and make-up, and a just-likeable enough cast with a few clever touches thrown into the mix (like incorporating two of the lead actors from the original as different characters, paying an amusing homage to the orignal). To tell the truth, over the years, this flick, in all its cheesy glory has risen from the grave of \\"dead\\" movies in my heart to the staus of \\"undead\\". It has become one of my favorite guilty pleasures, so to speak, and I was looking forward to this DVD release like a warm cup of brains.    That being said, on to the DVD review. Before I go too far, let me just start by saying, I could not stomach to sit through the entire DVD.     From what I did see, picture quality was sharp enough, exhibiting little or no noticable print damage. Colors are bold and sharp in comparison with my VHS copy. Sound quality seems decent enough with little or no noticable hiss.    Here's where the tragedy begins.... Why, oh why, warner?    The soundtrack has been COMPLETELY changed from the version I am used to. (If you don't believe me, toggle through the audio to the french track and you will hear the original mono track.) They also added a CHEESY AS HELL voiceover at the beginning of the film that I guess is meant to explain the goings on from the first flick (treating us like morons, as if none of us have ever seen the orignal and have no clue what is going on). Now this is where I'm confused. The box and copy in the credits still sport the name of the original musician (the same as my VHS copy), J. Peter Robinson. Maybe there was an alternate cut of this film floating around with a different music soundtrack from the same musicain, but I have never heard of such a thing, and the style of the music is a far cry from the version I am used to. I could be mistaken, but the version I am used to on VHS (without that God awful opening dialoge and syth-crap soundtrack) is almost certainly the version I saw on the big screen back in the day. The only thing I can come up with is that maybe Warner wanted to release it with a stereo track and could't translate the original mono well, so they took alternate music from the same artist and substituted it. This is just speculation, but if it is the case, SHAME ON YOU WARNER for even attempting to improve on someone elses art, no matter how crappy that art may be. Remember beauty is in the eye of the beholder.     Or maybe its just another case of the creators tampering with their own work, tirelessy spending there life striving to correct past mistakes, not being able to move on (here's looking at you Mr. Lucas!!!) Move on and let us enjoy the crap we saw when we were young (or masterpiece if you are speaking of Star Wars). Let us continue to enjoy the movies of our youth unaltered, so we can see how advanced we were for the time and/or how far we've come since then.     Whew! Glad I got that off my chest.    Now avoid this release like the plague, and leave Warner to ponder why no one is buying this release. Let the copies rot like corpses on store shelves until Warner or someone else decides to ressurect this unsung slice of zombie cheese from the 80's and give it the attention it has earned.    For now \\"Send More Paramedics.....\\"
B000002IRL|5.0|Overkill have got to be the most underrated thrash band ever, and this is probably the best album I've heard from them.(though it's pretty close between this and Years of Decay)  They've got greater variety than just about any other thrash band, a way above average singer and some of the most consistent riff-writing around.  Plus, they have some of the better lyrics in the genre, and lack the stupid posturing lots of metal bands tend to disply.  Simply put, no thrash fan should be without this album.<br /><br />This album is noteworthy partially because it is one of the few straight-up old school thrash albums to actually have good production.  The guitars are thick and clear, the drums thud nicely and it's all balanced out very well.  Fortunately, it has superior songwriting to go along with the excellent production.  Each of the conventional, driving thrash songs works well, and it's got a number of true classics. Coma is about everything you want from a thrash opener, although the intro is perhaps a bit too long.  It's got some of the best riffs on the album, and lotsa nice double bass too.  Blood Money is probably the best straight ahead thrash song here.  I absolutely love the chorus, and it's got memorable vocals throughout.  Definitely the most energetic song here too.  Live Young, Die Free is an absolute clinic in thrash riff writing.(best riffs on the album for sure)  All the riffs rule and they do a particularly good job of mutating the riffs.(Like how the main riff comes in has 2 main variants, one using triplets, the other alternate picking)  It's got another good chorus too.  The title track is a masterpiece of grooving, atmospheric metal. Overkill does slow material better than any other thrash band, and this is about as good as it gets. The riffs are absolutely crushingly heavy and the drumming is agonizingly slow and powerful.  It's also got some really great vocals from Ellsworth.(As is typical of their slower songs.) The pair Nice Day For A Funeral and Soulitude close out the album as a single, 10 minute+ epic.  Not as heavy as Horrorscope, but even more atmospheric, with more melody and some very nice lead work.  The 2 choruses are great, once again.  The chorus to Soulitude is pretty affecting, and it brings the album to a great close.  The cover of Frankenstein is really cool too.  It brings in a bit more melodicism and light-heartedness to the album, but it still thrashes pretty good.<br /><br />That's it.  This is pretty much mandatory for thrash fans.al and Soulitude close out the album as a single, 10 minute+ epic.

0385504209|4.0|I finally gave into the hype and enjoyed the novel for what it was. This story will allow you to stretch your imagination and force you to use your mind to try and unravel the mystery of the code. I was skeptical at first but after the first 20 pages I found it hard to put down. While many people have strong opinions about the accuracy of the novel all can agree that it is a well written tale of mystery and intrigue that can be enjoyed by all ages no matter what your religious background contains.
B000000JO3|5.0|This is the album that I will always associate with the best times of my life.  In no way did it ever let me down.  The passion, intensity and sincerity of Ian MacKaye have only left positive influences on my life and these songs can conjur up emotions that only treasured memories of childhood can deliver.  This album keeps me young.  I will listen to it when I'm 67 years old and will still get shivers when I hear the last lines of Filler.  Nothing has or will ever come close to Minor Threat.  They were the once in a millenium combination of energy, talent and drive that spawned a 1,000 knock offs who will never fully understand.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Before my first listen to \\"Mechanical Animals\\" I didn't really think much of Marilyn Manson. His previous albums seemed to chug along without much of a purpose aside from shocking his listeners (save for a few moments of \\"Antichrist Superstar\\") and the musicianship and lyrics left much to be desired. 1998's \\"Mechanical Animals\\" is Marilyn Manson, the man, the band, in top form. Probably their most shocking effort to date, mainly because it sounds absolutely nothing like what came before or afterwards. Loosely a concept album based around Manson's then love interest, actress Rose McGowan, this work is 80% tragic love story, 10% alienation, 10% isolation, with McGowan serving as the muse. Autobiographical tunes such as \\"I Don't Like The Drugs (But The Drugs Like Me)\\" and \\"The Dope Show\\" paint a picture of Marilyn Manson's high-speed lifestyle, the latter contains a line that pretty much sums up Manson and sets the tone for the rest of the album -- \\"I hate today/who will I wake up with tomorrow?\\" However, other tracks such as \\"Great Big White World\\" and \\"Mechanical Animals\\" expose a more emotional side while being the strongest and most sonically compelling anthems of Mansons's career. As you get deeper into the album, the lyrical content gets darker and the musical landscape is much more unqiue and abstract, best displayed on the moody and haunting \\"Speed Of Pain,\\" a semi-acoustic song that sounds like vintage Pink Floyd. \\"Coma White,\\" the album's closer is definitely the pinnacle, a passionate and tragic song that revolves around Manson & McGowan's unique relationship and contains the memorable chorus: \\"You were from a perfect world/A world that threw me away today.\\" As a whole, \\"Mechanical Animals\\" is the strongest and most cohesive work the band has accomplished today. It is a genuine oddity and a downright shame that the standard set by this album hasn't been carried onto the following, less imaginative albums. Could it be a lack of inspiration? For by the time Manson recorded his next album, \\"Holy Wood,\\" his relationship with McGowan had already tapered off. Could it be the self proclaimed God Of ____ found the one true love of his life? Who knows. All that is evident here is that there was an immense amount of inspiration and emotion poured into these 14 tracks. The one album by Marilyn Manson that I can personally put on and play the whole way through. You don't have to be a fan of industrial, gothic or metal music to appreciate \\"Mechanical Animals.\\" If you are looking for a deep, personal and flat-out sad album, make this album next on your \\"To-buy\\" list.nson recorded his next album, \\"Holy Wood,\\" his relationship with McGowan had already tapered off.

B00001ZT6Z|5.0|I got to witness this line up live on the tour for this particular album, and MAN!! was it awsome! This was the start of Tony Iommi going in a new direction with the music and it was a turn for the better. This album is unfortunatly over looked by millions of Ozzy loving idiots which is a freaking shame! This album and the couple of them to follow were awsome. If you have never heard this record or this line up for that matter BUY THIS RECORD!! forget the Ozzy era Sabbath this is a completely different sound, a more evolved sound, more evolved song writing and DEFINATLY more evolved guitar playing on Tony's part. Not to mention he has Tony Martin on vocals and Cozy Powell on drums for christ sake!!
B00005JMJG|1.0|'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' has an unnecessarily long title and is way too strange and convoluted to take seriously. It is understandable to show a story told from a different perspective, but a filmmaker has to set limits. It makes no sense in trying to confuse the audience as much as you can. That does not make the film intelligent or original. 'Eternal Sunshine..' is too full of itself; it says, 'look how creative I am, telling this story in such an odd way. I dare you to figure it out'. Nobody will gain anything if the filmmakers are trying to make the audience look stupid. It only creates an exaggerated ego for those who do understand it.<br /><br />The story is about two lovers who decide to erase the memory of each other. When they are erased from each other's memory, they find themselves drawn back to each other by sheer chance. I think one point the film is trying to make is that true love is a destiny. Two people are drawn to each other because there is something greater is at work, bringing lovers together. Fantastic idea, but it can be told in much simpler ways than done in this movie. The idea shouldn't be expressed in the over-the-top way that it was done in 'Eternal Sunshine..'. Good performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, an unlikely pair bringing chemistry to the screen, but even they couldn't save this jumbled mess.
B000000QFV|4.0|TYR and Headless Cross are probably the best albums sabbath put out after Dio and Ozzy. Personally i find the post Ozzy era Sabbath much more interesting than the old '70s stuff. Tony Martin does an awsome job on this record! The man has an amazing voice. Of course Cozy pounds out some awsome drum parts and Tony, well, he's Tony, Tony is THE MAN!! I actually got to see this line up on the Headless Cross tour in England and it was one of the BEST live shows i have ever seen! If you don't have this record BUY IT!!!

B000099T2L|4.0|first off i am going to say that i am suprised i brought this cd. because of the fact of how stars (whoever) can be overexposed. i love the song crazy in love that is my song it just gets u moving. but i never wanted to buy it cuz i didnt give it a chance,then i heard it over a friends house and i was like wow! i can be missing out of some good music this sounds like it will be worth the money. i brought the cd and was impressed and (jealous) dont tell anyone lol. anyway the stand out tracks on this song to me what i enjoy the most is SPEECHLESS this is my favorite song this is a seductive song,sexy,all that u know love making kissing whatever this is it. and of course crazy in love, baby boy,me myself and i(it describes my ex like she dated him too lol) be with you, dangerously in love 2, and gift from virgo. i like all the songs pretty much but these are what i listen to the most, SPEECHLESS BEING NUMBER ONE! SO COP THIS CD USED OR NOT OR WHATEVER GO BUY IT'S WORTH IT
B0002Y4TZG|4.0|Disc One: The Original LP <br /> <br />     Hands down, The Clash's \\"London Calling\\" is one of the strongest albums in rock history.  Despite being a punk rock group, The Clash explored reggae, ska, jazz, pop with strong melodies with equally as strong lyrics.  Throughout the album's 19 tracks, it is never boring and is essential in anyone's record collection. <br /> <br />Disc Two: The Vanilla Tapes <br /> <br />     The demos from the \\"London Calling\\" sessions are very interesting but it is by no means something one just sits back and listens to.  The sound quality is poor, and the songs are not quite in the form that they would take on later.  The most intresting is the cover of Bob Dylan's \\"The Man in Me\\".  It would have been interesting to hear a better cut of that song.  Interesting listening for fans but newcomers might not welcome it as much. <br /> <br />DVD: The Last Testament <br /> <br />     There is some cool videos on the DVD of \\"Train in Vain\\", \\"London Calling\\" and \\"Clampdown\\" but the documentary itself really kind of drags.  Listening to the album take form on disc 2 is interesting but nothing is really learned in the documentary.   Plays a lot like a \\"Behind the Music\\" episode but not nearly as in depth.  Pretty much just an added bonus. <br /> <br />FINAL REVIEW: <br /> <br />     As I mentioned, \\"London Calling\\" is a must have.  A Five Star classic that ranks among the greatest albums of all time.  Not having this is like not having \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" or \\"Kind of Blue\\".  The album in its new extended package is excessive and for die hard fans.  The demos are interesting but nothing to listen to repeatedly and the DVD is a throw away.  Not a waste of money but if you own the original remastered CD, that should suffice.

I haven't read the book first, but I've heard it wasn't exactly true to the  book, however the actors are fitting and I love maggie smith in any movie I've seen. The graphics and growing of the garden is fantastic. It's definately worth watching anyway though, and it makes me want to read the book of this. :-D pianist@shaw.ca
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies that I have seen in years. Michael Moore has done an excellent job in setting an example for the American people for how to be a true American. In his movie he has provided an excellent synopsis of the numerous books that have come out chronicaling the actions of the Bush White House in Iraq and the War on Terror. Those people that have bashed Mr. Moore for being un-American are some of the most hypocritical people that I have ever heard. Mr. Moore has shown us what a true American is by truly embrasing not only the right, but the obligation, of all Americans to think critically of their government, no matter who is in power, and anybody that critizes him for this should take a good look at their own actions and how those actions would be catagorized by our founding fathers. This is a must own for anyone who believes that the right to free speech is an essential right to have and to excercize.
B000268QB2|3.0|Taken on its own and out of the context of present-day indie-pop, Keane is a pretty impressive little band.  With nothing but a vocalist, keyboardist and drummer (and good production), they manage to squeeze out a full, often anthemic sound.  Tom Chaplin has an impressive vocal range, which makes the band's music even more reminiscent of Travis and Thom Yorke of Radiohead.  And the comparisons to Coldplay are inevitable.  But that's part of the problem here: with all these other British bands out there with a similar temperament (and let's not forget Starsailor), Keane comes off sounding derivative.  They are accomplished at what they do, but after a while the sameness of the mood and presentation leaves one a bit unsatisfied.  The leadoff tracks, \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and \\"This Is the Last Time\\", are strong and single-worthy, and \\"Your Eyes Open\\" is probably the closest they get to rocking (and to a Coldplay sound).  \\"Sunshine\\" is a pleasant tune with fine harmonies that sounds like Ben-Folds-meets-the-Beach-Boys.  So there is indeed good stuff going on in this CD.  But so much more of it is, frankly, forgettable.  It's possible to create a unique and identifiable sound with a small band.  Ben Folds Five, The Police, and Morphine (each with three members) and The Black Keys (with only two) have accomplished it, and Keane probably could, too.  It just seems that they've taken a safer musical path.
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot plays out like the Dookie episode of the Daily Show, and while it seemed unlikely these guys would find themselves as respectible political commentators when they released such gems as, oh, say, Dominated Love Slave, it turns out, they're pretty good at it. <BR>There's disillusionment of course, and plenty of frustration. It wouldn't be Green Day without either. But they've hooked a few deep thoughts on a few infectious tunes, and the result makes the rest of the radio playlists look ridiculous and trite.

B00005JMJG|5.0|\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is Charlie Kaufman's best screenplay to date. His typical self-indulgence is tamed by a tight, disciplined story. The offbeat and unconventional script comments on the value of relationships and painful memories without being weird for its own sake. Michel Gondry's relatively low budget direction is creative, stylized, but not heavy-handed. I think this is Jim Carrey's best dramatic role, as well. Joel (Jim Carrey) has split with Clementine (Kate Winslet), his free-spirited girlfriend of two years. As Valentine's Day approaches, he decides to try to reconcile, but finds to his bewilderment that Clementine doesn't seem to recognize him. She has impulsively had their tempestuous relationship erased from her memory in an effort to put it behind her. Joel tracks down Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkerson), who performed the procedure, and decides in a huff to do the same. But midway through the erasure, Joel changes his mind. He tries desperately to preserve memories of Clementine by hiding her in parts of his brain the procedure may not reach.<br /><br />Considering that the past, present, fantasy, and reality all run together in \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless  Mind\\", it's amazing how coherent this film is. We go backward and forward, in and out of memories, switch between characters and subplots, and I never lost track of what was going on. Nor does the film ever lose its emotional focus. Michel Gondry and the film's editor, Vald&iacute;s &Oacute;skarsd&oacute;ttir, have done some amazing work. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are perfectly suited to their roles. Carrey is low-key, and Winslet takes on the hyperactive, outgoing role that is usually his. Kirsten Dunst does a nice job in a supporting role as Dr. Mierzwiak's enamored secretary. Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are appropriately flakey as his technicians.  \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is one of the best films of 2004, and it deserved better than a tepid reception at the box office. Its brilliant direction, two big stars, and off-the-wall, but ultimately upbeat, script never fail to entertain.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 2 featurettes, an audio commentary by director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, 4 deleted scenes, a music video, and a commercial for Lacuna, Inc., the memory erasure folks. \\"A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" (10 minutes) features interviews with the cast and principle crew in which they talk about their roles in the film. It's not insightful. \\"A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry\\" (15 minutes) contains more information about making the film and has some funny moments. The audio commentary isn't bad, but it does have a rambling quality and a lot of lulls. I would have liked more technical information, because the film is so innovative, but there is some discussion of how the film's very long shots were made. The music video is for the song \\"Light & Day\\" by Polyphonic Spree. Not a good video. It's too bad that the DVD does not include the theatrical trailer for the film, as it was one of the most creative and effective trailers in my memory.

B00028HBKM|5.0|One of the most frustrating things about the Passion hoopla was trying to find out if it might actually be a good film.  The reviews and press were almost wholly concerned with other issues - Mel's father's beliefs, potentially anti-semitic lines, the violence, etc - but I did not see a single review addressing the quality of The Passion as a work of cinema. So I waited until the DVD came out.<br /><br />This is the most striking and original film from any nation since the 1970s.  In many ways, this film makes me think of the classic American films of that decade, where directors had control and turned movies into works of art.  The Passion is entirely free of any kind of studio cliche or formula.  The visuals are stunning.  Mel's independence has yielded a masterpiece.  If he had chosen a different historical subject, The Passion would be compared to Lawrence of Arabia.
B0001YRVN4|3.0|First, I loved the movies.  How can you not love Star Wars?  I enjoyed the updates Lucas put into the films.  I will even say that at the end of Return of the Jedi, RETURNING Anakin is a good move.  But my really big disappointment was the \\"special\\" extra 4th disk.  I didn't mind too much that so much of the disk was just a commercial for Star Wars III ... you have to expect that.  I was very upset that the major documentary turned out to be something I had previously seen on A & E.  As someone who had laid out money for something that was suppose to be new and a bonus, I felt completely ripped off.  I wish they had just been honest and sold me the 3 movies without the very non-special bonus.
B00005JNEI|1.0|The USA is in for some very rough times as long as weak minded people continue to rely on propaganda and misinformation to make important decisions.  The likes of Michael Moore and Sean Hannity pose the same threat, just from opposite directions.  Here's a suggestion for you . . . if you'd truly like to know what happened on 9/11, read the 9/11 commission report.  If you just want to see someone make fun of Bush, thereby propping up your self esteem, by all means, this movie is for you and the rest of the lazy masses.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|This latest project (Shangri La) exemplifies another direction in making albums.  It is not a techno album by any stretch, but rather has an earthy feel to it.  While it is not a rocking album and won't have any top 10 singles in the US, the songs employ a mystical feeling almost like a soundtrack. Through his music and lyrics you paint yourself a picture.  I found myself immediately playing three times in a row the first song 5:15 before going to the next.  With Knopfler you never know exactly what you are going to get.  But that's the beauty of this album. It is understated as most his solo works, and he leaves you wanting more not the usual overkill.  The music industry from a craftsman perspective is dull and fading and it is refreshing to see that a craftsman/musician makes albums not for commercialization purposes but for the love of making music and storytelling.  <br /> <br />That being said, this album rates as the best solo work he has done as of yet at least equal to Sailing to Philadelphia.  But don't get caught up in past albums.  This album is unique on it's own. I have listened to this album several times over and it still sounds fresh and inviting.  If you are a die hard Dire Straits fan looking for material of older days you might be disappointed.  If you are looking for extended solos this album might not reach you. But to me it is the sound of the note, not the frequency in how many notes are played. Less is more and sometimes better as in this case. If you a Mark Knopfler fan you'll like this album all the while appreciating album making in it's purist form pushing again into a new direction.  <br />   <br /> <br />
0393316041|5.0|I read excerpts from this book in college, and after hearing about it for what seemed to be the hundredth time in a recent seminar, I finally decided to read it in its entirety.  I was not disappointed.  Richard Feynman reveals his inner most thoughts in the form of a series of anecdotes that will make you laugh out loud.  Feynman is a true genius, but he does not come across as aloof I was worried he would.  Instead, he remains grounded, and simply tells you (the reader) what happened to him in the past.  I highly recommend everyone read this book whether you are an aspiring scientist or simply curious how a Nobel Prize winner leads thinks about his own dreams.
B0001YRVN4|4.0|Obviously you can't really complain about star wars because it's such an incredible story.  My only gripe about this new release is a completely inappropriate and even irreverent change made to episode 6, return of the jedi.  After all evil is defeated and they are celebrating victory on the moon of endor, you see the ghosts of yoda, obi-wan, and anakin.  This is where my gripe comes in...instead of just leaving it the way it was, lucas decided it would be a good idea to impose hayden christiansen's image.  I say if they were going to ruin it why not go all the way and throw in ewan mcgregor and then it would be a complete sham.  I hope I'm not the only one who feels this way.  To end on a positive note, the graphics were much better and it was a welcome addition to the media library.
B000002H97|2.0|Ladies and gentlemen. Please let me clarify. <br />This album is widely known as such a \\"great\\" album because Metallica finally got a producer who forged their sound together to form \\"The Perfect Album\\". News Flash: Bob Rock destroyed Metallica's sound and made them go mainstream. Of course Metallica supplied great riffs for songs like Enter Sandman and Sad But True, but what happened to the extremely complicated verses and interludes of \\"...And Justice For All\\" and before? The reason why this album is so popular is because it was watered down for all the sheep who listen to mainstream. Before this album Metallica had a hardcore fan group comprised of people who wanted some heavy f***ing metal. After this album every barbie girl had a copy because Metallica was so fad. <br />Another news flash: Kirk Hammett sucks. I'm sure he's responsible for 88% of the people who pick up guitar now a days, but once you play for only 4 years and can play almost every solo he's laid down, you kind of feel like he lacks something. Kirk was the reason I picked up the guitar, and I have since moved on to much better bands. Try listening to John Petrucci, Jason Becker, or Joe Satriani (who taught Kirk) and tell me that Kirk is impressive. <br />Now don't get me wrong, I own this album and will always own this album. Nothing Else Matters is one of my favorite songs ever. But this album is EXTREMELY overrated. <br />If you are here for the thrash: Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and ...And Justice For All are MUCH better albums.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|...they pulled a solution out of left field. No motivation for the crime. Cops don't bother to pursue a known multiple murderer. Gratuitous pedophilia with no significant connection to the story. Yuck. <br /> <br />There is a certain type of person who believes that if it is depressing and pointless, then it must be ART. Sadly, the beloved Clint Eastwood appears to be such a person. At least as a director. <br /> <br />You can afford to miss this one. Good acting couldn't save it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B00005JLEX|4.0|The only problem I have with this set is I want more features, more inane trivia on Jerry, like clues to the Superman references and its origin.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am always hesitant to buy a series I haven't seen, 'cause you never know. But this one is really enjoyable.      The combination of Western/SciFi appeals to me on a level beyond logic. Actually, this combination is not so far fetched when you consider the primitive homes of some poor folks around the world...who nevertheless have TV sets. Besides which there is the Robert Heinlein argument that 'horses can make more horses and that's one trick machinery will never master', or words to that effect, which makes it almost sensible that frontier planets WOULD opt for primitive technology in some areas. As for the cowboy-style clothes: have you ever seen women in kimonos, chattin' on their cell-phones in the middle of high-tech Tokyo? Some technology/clothing combinations are so wild they just WORK. Firefly is so well-done, it ALL works.    The thing that makes it all work is the writing and the acting. They are both top-quality in an understated way. I have only watched three episodes and already I care about the characters. What more needs to be said?     Oh, just one more thing: each character seems to have some little something that is appropriate to their role and which just kind of grabs you. Have you ever met somebody who might not have been the most beautiful or the most well-educated, but there was something that just...stood out? And made you like him? All the characters here seem to have that.     I can't wait to watch the rest of the episodes and I do hope there will be a movie.    Fun, quirky, involving, you'll probably like it. Buy it now.    Update: I have watched a few more and I like it even more. Very consistent, fine story-telling. This one had \\"hit series\\" written all over it.
0790731452|3.0|On one level, this is an intelligent comedy, especially in its lampoon of  the military, and the executive and legislative branches of the federal government. It's kinda campy, but the scene where Congress is blown up is worth if if you're in the mood for this kind of film.
B00005M91K|5.0|Ron Fricke, director and photographer of this film, was also the director of photography for the more well-known classic Koyaanisqatsi. For the many people who fell in love with Koyaanisqatsi and its sequel Powaqqatsi but were disappointed with the third film of that trilogy (Naqoyquatsi), you may find as I did that Baraka is the film you were wishing for and didn't get. <br /> <br />Like Koyaanisqasi and Powaqqatsi, Baraka is a visual and audiory feast for the senses and soul. A journey into the sacred and the deepest truths of humanity's connection (and disconnection) with the divine and with nature. You will be immersed in the culture-defining rituals of both ancient and modern traditions, and take and extraordinary cinematic journey through 24 countries on six continents. This is the kind of film that can, in 104 minutes, permanently and deeply change your perspective on what it means to be alive on this planet today. And then change it again on the second and third viewings. <br /> <br />Disclaimer: Many people find films in this genre (all visual and musical, with no dialogue or \\"story\\" in the conventional Hollywood sense of the term) completely unwatchable and \\"boring.\\" You certainly will be disappointed (or at least disoriented) if you are expecting a film with actors playing out a \\"plot.\\" However, if you can open yourself up and give yourself over to an entirely different conception of what film as an artform can be, you may agree that Baraka, like Koyanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, is one of the most outstanding and moving films of the 20th century--perhaps even of all time. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|No matter what your political affiliations are, you need to see the film and just be educated about who your president is. It's really as simple as that.<br /><br />I'm neither a republican or a democrat, I vote on the issues, myself. And the first thing that strikes me about the DVD release, though I saw the film in the theaters is, it was, as a friend pointed out to me, strategically brilliant to have the release coincide with the debates and the weeks preceding the election.<br /><br />That said, when you look at this film on DVD, turn the sound off, and read the commentary using the subtitles, and make a conscious effort to just observe the leader of this country, and the factual information about him - ignore the editorializing (There isn't much, but when you see what is obviously an opinion and not the reporting of a fact, just ignore it.)<br /><br />Then just listen to the words that come out of the mouth of the current leader of the free world. That's the most important thing this film does, is show the man behind the music, if you will.<br /><br />That's the most important part of this film. What you then decide to do on election day, for or against him, will be a more informed decision - about yourself.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Look, other reviews on here tell you what you need to know about the movie.. but, for me.. just going through what Joel has.. this movie left me speechless. It truly is a must-see movie and a recommendation to anyone especially couples out there who may not realize how blessed they are until it's too late..
B00005JMEW|4.0|If you're at all a fan of martial arts action films, you're going to enjoy this. I'm definitely a QT fan, but for one of his films I didn't think it that great. What earns it four stars for me is the femaie heroine, even if I don't fully believe Uma Thurman in this role.<br /><br />It's actually imaginative And gory, intelligent (in its references) and (blissfully) stupid.<br /><br />But not every film  has to be a stunning display of high-brow, high-minded stimulation for the cranium.<br /><br />The bottom line is, if you like blood, you like gore, and you're mature enough to relax and enjoy it, without thinking of it as real, or even an accurate reflection of reality, have fun, and enjoy this action film starring a chick flik actress. I'm a chick and I dug it.
B0001O3YD0|3.0|I am not a fan of Vin Diesel nor am I a fan of the Riddick universe. But out of curiousity, I decided to check this B-movie out, seeing that it has somehow reached cult movie status.    I was apprehensive initially. The crash in the beginning had no set up and suspense and plunges us straight into the action. I guess it's trying to follow Lucas' Saturday afternoon matinee format. There were a few clever edits and shots inserted in the crash. Namely, Radha Mitchell's eye and the pre-crash impact intercutting each other.     After the crash, with the exception of the Riddick character, the rest of the movie descended into humdrum lame brain cliched of a maroon adventure with alien in rubber suits pursuing them.    However, as the movie progresses, the concept used is unllike any other monster movies out there. The presence and absence of light plays a big part. Surprisingly, there was a substantial amount of morality play and characterisation between all the characters.    By the end of the movie, even though I was still a little underwhelmed, \\"Pitch Black\\" made a good time killer.    This DVD edition was being touted as the unrated director's cut. I couldn't really find what are the extra footage being inserted as I did not have the opportunity to watch the theatrical cut. The transfers are great. The video transfer utilized the film's unique colour schemes that depicts the abysmal planet's atmosphere. The DTS track really rocks! Especially when the alien mosnters' were wailing all over the place, the rear speakers will be put into action. The extras are a big disappointment, it turned out to be nothing more than a promotional fluff for \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\", which by the way, it's not a very good Sci-fi, medieval \\"Conanesque\\" hybrid.     4 stars for the movie. 3 stars for the DVD, due to lack of interesting special features.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|The movie itself was really dull until the final shoot out between the good guys and gals, and the bad guys. Zellweger is the only lively character on Cold Mountain. Everyone else is stale and some are down right nasty.    <br />   <br />If you really liked this film then you'll probably like the DVD package. It has all the bells and whistles a DVD has to offer.
B00005JMEW|1.0|The title says it all. In the infinite wisdom of not offending the MPAA, Tarantino practised self-censorship and degraded his grindhouse of a fine movie to such an abysmal state. <br /> <br />The showdown sequence was practically unwatchable. Everyone's spewing out motor oil! The blood looks like petroleum in B&W. This DVD is a travesty as well. The extras are laughably minimal. Who is Miramax trying to kid? The fact that it still remained on Amazon's top 100 best selling list for the past 6 months speaks for itself. What a total rip-off! <br /> <br />Save your money. Go get the Region 2 Japanese DVD version. Even though it may be costly, but it's worth every single penny. For more details on what American audiences and most of the audiences of the Western hemisphere are missing, head on down to the Internet Movie Database for a scene by scene description on what you guys are missing. Oh, and the Japanese DVD at least had the decency to include interviews, making of featurettes, trailers and tv spots from the US.
B000002UAX|3.0|I was a big fan of The Beatles in my final school year in 1988. Firstly, in my school, The Beatles were far from lauded. In fact they were highly sneered at! U2 , The Smiths and Iron Maiden were the \\"in\\" bands. (And I only liked Maiden! )So I can't say that I was under any peer pressure to like them. I liked them for what they were, good songwriters, not because I had to like them. <br /> <br />Now the question comes as to whether they were the best band ever. Time has marched on and I can look back on things with the benefit of hindsight. In my opinion I don't think that ANY band can claim to be the best ever, despite the claims of the fans. How do you define best? Most melodic? Most angry?  Deepest lyrics? It's pointless! But for me The Beatles had a gift for both melody (eg Strawberry Fields, Hey Jude) and attitude (Helter Skelter , Hey Bulldog) People who give them 1 star and say they suck are as misguided as the people who praise the crap out of them and think everything did was untouchabe. The reality lies somehwere in between as is the case with so many things. People like black and white definitions though, and dislike anything in the grey undefined regions between them. So the Beatles suck and Nirvana rocks no The Bealtes rock and Metallica suck etc etc ad nauseum ZZZZZZ. How anyone can bear that kind of \\"debate\\" after more than a few minutes is something beyond me. <br /> <br />I believe today that the Beatles are neither untouchable nor worthless has beens. To the people who think they \\"suck\\"- well that's just fascinating. The physicist Neils Bohr  didn't agree with some of Einsteins theories and he published a thesis which contained the words \\"Einstein sucks\\". Nobody paid much attention to it though because it was just so damn boring. And to the people who think they're untouchable, just wait as the years pass, and your music taste changes. The Beatles have stood the test of time fairly well for me, but don't always come out smelling of roses. I still think The White Album has some quality stuff on it and one of the most tangible atmosphere of any  album I own. It was originally to be called A Dolls House, and you know, for some reason that title would have suited the mood of the album *exactly* I can't explain why though! However The White Album does for me as well have  a bit too much filler on it. So, a 3 overall for this album. <br /> <br />I consider The Beatles one of the best pop/rock bands ever. Untouchable? No. I also believe as a reviewer mentioned below that the more you talk about music the less you really understand it. It's to be listened to, not discussed too much! (Well I just discussed music there but I'm really just passing time wating for the sausage rolls in the oven to cook) There I've said my piece now. Thank you for reading.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I'm not an automatic Michael Moore fan. I think his manipulations are often far too obvious and his constant wisecracks and slacker 'average' guy shtick is tired and sometimes offensive. <br /> <br />I saw F 9/11 expecting more of the same. Impassioned appeals to patriotism, silly gags on powerful people and some good, honest criticism. For the most part, the film delivered - it was flag-waving, patriotic and mind-numbingly manipulative at times. But I left the theatre feeling vindicated in some way: for once, a mainstream movie was talking about the ugly side of the American Imperial project and did so in a very well-researched and thorough, yet entertaining way. <br /> <br />What I liked: <br />Moore spends a lot of time in the film exploring the connections between the Bush family and big Saudi and American money. It's a complex relationship and I think it's extremely important for people in the States to understand this. Bin Laden's own family were allowed to flee the states without any formal questioning. The US invaded Iraq although it posed no immediate threat. Bush's buddies routinely get contracts for weapons building and 'reconstruction' projects when there are wars. For the first time in a mainstream film, the connection between politics, corporations, profit and war were made. And i think it's a connection that is very hard to ignore. <br /> <br />Although Moore doesn't get too involved in the racism that Arab Americans have suffered post 9/11, he does spend some time on the fact that the US Army is desperate for young recruits and often goes into poor neighbourhoods, with plenty of people of colour to prey on, in order to fill its ranks. The scenes in Flint following around Army recruiters are classic documentary filmmaking. Moore backs off and lets these folks speak for themselves. It's powerful. <br /> <br />What i didn't like: <br />The opening scene and the soppy patriotic undertones. The whole scene with the mother whose son died in Iraq. Moore spends WAY too much time with her. Maybe it's because i'm not an American, but it seems pretty obvious to me that if you loose a child in a war that the world is largely very critical of, you're going to turn around and put some blame on the president who lead your son to death. I found this scene long, manipulative and I found Moore insincere and trying way too hard to make a point. I also didn't like the silly montage of countries that supported bush's war. Moore goes far out of his way to belittle them - it gets racist at some points and just plain dumb at others. <br /> <br />Overall all though, I thought it made some very timely and important arguments. That Bush and his friends, family and supporters are very powerful business people with direct profits to be made in the business of war. That Americans have largely been kept in the dark about the grimmer realities of the 'war on terror' and have been mislead and let down by corporate-controlled news media. And that the people who pay the ultimate price for this system are average Americans and folks from poor neighbourhoods.  <br /> <br />I recommend you see it for yourself if you haven't already.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|It's great that so much of the director's print has been discovered and fit in so seamlessly with the rest.  And the documentary outlining the reconstruction of GBU is super, what a treat to see old Eastwood and even older Wallach mouthing their young dialogue into their young mouths in the cushy recording studio, a far cry from the plains of New Mexico.  It makes you long for more, for there is probably another ten minutes of the complete version to be found, restored, and interpolated with the new extended version so splendidly presented here.<br /><br />The movie itself is one of the masterpieces both of Italian and US cinema, and how many films get to boast of that?  When I was a boy, the Morricone whistling theme became a top pop single, a feat that very few Westerns of recent vintage can aspire to.  It's a haunting melody and watched with Leone's trademark close-ups and then sudden cutaways to long grand vistas, it gives you the chills of sudden fear from your spine to all your extremities.

B000060OFT|1.0|What a P.O.S. this version of the classic tragedy is. I wasn't interested in seeing this mutilation of Shakespeare, but I HAD NO CHOICE, but to see it...in school when my English teacher showed it instead of the classic 1968 version starring Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey (great body) as the doomed lovers in 15th century Verona. The only part I liked in this film was Romeo pumping Tybalt's guts full of lead, then screaming to the heavens, \\"Oh, I am fortune's fool!!\\" The score (at the beginning and Mercutio's murder, during and as Romeo flees) was another thing I liked, but it was SO OUT OF PLACE!! And WHAT THE F--- was Mozart's music (25th Symphony in G minor, to be exact) doing in the movie?!! It was alright for \\"Amadeus,\\" but for a \\"modern adaptation\\" of a classic tragedy by Shakespeare?!! Mozart wasn't even born until 146 years after Shakespeare's death, for Christ's sakes!! Leave Mozart's music alone unless you can put it to PROPER USE, you S.O.B.'s!! That is DISRESPECTFUL to the great composer's memory, you a------!! One part that was really gross was Mercutio coming to the Capulet's party DRESSED AS A WOMAN!! Also, Capulet dressing like a womanish Julius Caesar and Lady Capulet as Cleopatra (both of whom Shakespeare had written plays about titled \\"Julius Ceasar\\" and \\"Antony And Cleopatra\\"). WHAT THE F--- was that? On top of that, when Shakespeare wanted a black person in his plays, he indicated it in the \\"Dramatis Personae.\\" (I'm NOT a racist, by the way). Also, to have guns in the film instead of swords, yet the word \\"sword\\" is on the gun whenever there's a close-up shot of it, WHAT THE F--- WAS THAT?!! HAVE RESPECT for Shakespeare, you g--d--- m-----f***ers or LEAVE HIM THE F--- ALONE!! DO IT RIGHT!! Jesus f***ing Christ!<br /><br />There's a right way and there's a wrong way to \\"Soup up Shakespeare\\" (again, no pun intended) and these c---suckers did it the wrong way. Luhrman kept the lines in, but CHANGING THE SETTING TO TODAY'S SOCIETY?!! And on top of that, saying them with AMERICAN ACCENTS?!! AND HARDLY ANY EMOTION IN THE RIGHT PLACES!! That is BLATANT DISRESPECT for one of the greatest playwrights who ever lived!! This film is TOTAL BULLSH--!! Claire Danes (\\"Little Women\\", \\"Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines\\", etc),Paul Sorvino (\\"The Rocketeer\\", \\"Italian Mambo\\" etc) and Diane Venora (\\"The Jackal\\", \\"Megiddo: The Omega Code 2\\", etc) are good actors, but their talents were ABSOULTELY WASTED in this m-----f***ing shred of a movie!! I urge you, DON'T buy or even RENT this version, it's GARBAGE!! If you WANT it modern, the closest you can get WITHOUT being irreverent to Shakespeare is \\"West Side Story\\" starring the great Natalie Wood. It doesn't use any lines from Shakespeare, the setting is different, but the concept is the same:forbidden love between two people. Get either that one or the classic 1968 movie version of \\"Romeo And Juliet\\" directed by Franco Zefferelli, rated PG for brief nudity. \\"West Side Story\\" is Not Rated. It was made in 1960. They're MUCH BETTER, trust me. This version is rated PG for scenes of contemporary violence. But SHOULD be rated NV-FPOS (Not Viewable-F***ing Piece Of Sh--) for a horrible movie. Damn you Luhrman, for shredding-no, MUTILATING the Bard's timeless work. NEVER DO IT AGAIN, YOU S.O.B.!! GOOD THING I didn't waste my money on THIS F---ING P.O.S. If you enjoy the Bard, BY ALL MEANS POSSIBLE, AVOID THIS DRUG-FILLED, CROSS-DRESSING, STYLIZED, MIS-NAMED MUTILATION OF SHAKESPEARE. \\"It offends me to the soul to see a peri-wig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters...that's villainous. I would have such a fellow whipped.\\" If William Shakespeare were alive, he'd do the same to you, you S.O.B.!! Kenneth Branagh would've done it well, I'm sure. HE's the BEST Shakespearean actor since Sir Laurence Olivier and both of them, along with Shakespeare, would've been APALLED AT THIS \\"TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE.\\" AVOID THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS!! GET THE ZEFFERELLI VERSION (BETTER ACTING AND IT'S FAITHFUL TOTHE TEXT) AND \\"WEST SIDE STORY.\\" WORTH EVERY PENNY.T) AND \\"WEST SIDE STORY.\\" WORTH EVERY PENNY.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Walt Disney's classic tale is finally on DVD!! It features, of course, the original edition of the movie, PLUS the Special Edition (featuring an original, never before seen musical sequence) and the Work In Progress Edition, a Disney first. The best parts of the film are:when the Enchanted Objects sing &#34;Be Our Guest&#34; (one of three Oscar-nominated songs, the other two being &#34;Belle&#34; and of course, &#34;Beauty And The Beast&#34; [which won Best Song, beating out the other two, but ALL the songs in this movie are excellent]) and when Belle and The Beast are dancing in the ballroom as Mrs. Potts (voiced by a spectacular and talented Angela Lansbury) sings the title song. The bonus features on Disc 2 are equally enchanting as the movie itself.<br /><br />Paige O'Hara is WONDERFUL as the voice of Belle, Robby Benson is equally good as the voice of The Beast, arrogant and loving as the film progresses, Angela Lansbury is PERFECT as the voice of Mrs. Potts, Jerry Orbach is hilarious as the voice of Lumiere, the French candelabra, David Odgen Stiers (voice of the villainous Ratcliff in &#34;Pocahontas&#34; and &#34;Pocahontas II: Journey To A New World, opposite Irene Berard, reprising her role from the first movie and Billy Zane as John Rolfe) is just as comical in his fights with Lumiere. Overall, a FANTASTIC job by Walt Disney Pictures in making a &#34;Tale As Old As Time&#34; even more timeless by the well-deserved Special Platinum Edition DVD treatment. Rated G.
B000002KGT|4.0|Fleetwood Mac had begun to really make their mark on the pop scene with the highly successful 1975 self-titled album, \\"Fleetwood Mac\\".  It was on that 1975 effort, where Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks who were performing as duo called \\"Buckingham-Nicks\\" joined the band.    This would form the core lineup for Fleetwood Mac (Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood) for the next decade and would complete Fleetwood Mac's transformation from a blues/rock band to a pop band.   The follow-up to Fleetwood Mac was \\"Rumours'.  The story of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\" is well documented.   The title of the album says it all - and if you know the history of Fleetwood Mac, you know that emotions were running high as this album came together.  Namely, Christine and John McVie's marriage was falling apart - as was the long term relationship between Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.   One common thread I have noticed about the core members is that they tend to wear their hearts on their sleeve.  When the emotions are running high, thus Fleetwood Mac is in high gear.   The emotions that were running through the band were the catalyst for this effort. <br /> <br />There are 11 tracks on the collection.   The songwriting for the tracks is basically split between Buckingham (\\"Second Hand News\\", \\"Never Going Back Again\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\"), Stevie Nicks (\\"Dreams\\", \\"I Don't Want to Know\\", \\"Gold Dust Woman\\"), and Christine McVie (\\"Don't Stop\\", :Songbird\\", \\"You Make Loving Fun\\", \\"Oh Daddy\\").  The entire band is credited with writing the song \\"The Chain\\".   For this particular effort, I think Christine and Stevie are the better two songwriters.  I would put Lindsey a notch below the two ladies.  This isn't meant to knock Lindsey.  While I've never thought that Lindsey was a very strong songwriter, he does have strengths in a lot of other areas.   In particular, when it comes to background vocals, I feel Lindsey Buckingham is the best in the business.   Listen to how Lindsey's voice blends in beautifully on songs such as \\"Dreams\\" (\\"Thunder only happens when it's raining...\\"), \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\", and \\"Gold Dust Woman\\".   It's no secret that these three tracks are Stevie Nicks written tracks.  Stevie deserves an enormous amount of credit - it shows that she worked with Lindsey for a long time and definitely finds a way to work with him.   There almost is a magic when this duo works vocals together.   And this was a sign of things to come because Lindsey and Stevie would blend their vocals on future works such as \\"Gypsy\\" from \\"Mirage\\" and \\"Silver Springs\\" (especially on the 1997 Live Album \\"The Dance\\").   Lindsey also deserves a lot of credit for his guitar work.   Like he is underrated for background vocals, he is also underrated when it comes to his guitar work.    Lindsey has also shown a strength of being an outstanding producer.   He has a drive for perfection and some may knock that it often takes him a while to get the final product out - but when it comes out it is quality.    Lindsey provides a more acoustic sound on tracks such as \\"I Don't Want to Know\\", \\"Second Hand News\\", \\"Oh Daddy\\" and \\"Never Going Back Again\\".   He provides much more of an edge on tracks such as \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"Don't Stop\\", and \\"You Make Loving Fun\\". <br /> <br />It's only appropriate that all of the members of Fleetwood Mac contributed to \\"The Chain\\".  \\"The Chain\\" refers to the bond between the five core members of the band.  Despite all of the stress and emotions that were going on with the making of \\"Rumours\\", the band holds firm by saying \\"you would never break the chain\\".  I also love the multiple harmonies in this song.  Here's a place where not only Lindsey does well on the background vocals, but he shows some definite passion as he takes the lead \\"And if you don't love me again\\".  John McVie - often the forgotten member of the band, has some great bass work here. <br /> <br />This collection will give you four ofthe most popular Fleetwood Mac tunes of all time.  You will hear Stevie Nicks on lead vocals with \\"Dreams\\".  Lindsey Buckingham will take the lead vocals on \\"Go Your Own Way\\" and \\"Don't Stop\\".   Christine McVie takes the lead vocals on what is one of the strongest Mac tunes - \\"You Make Loving Fun\\".  All four of these songs are sung by the songwriters with the exception of \\"Don't Stop\\". <br /> <br />You should also get this album for some of the tunes which might not be as common.   \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" is well known among Mac fans, but the casual fan might not have heard it before.  This is the best song on the album.  It brings an \\"old west\\" theme to it.  As mentioned, it is enhanced by Lindsey's terrific background vocals, but Stevie does a tremendous job on lead vocals as well.   Another tune is the folk sounding \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" which also features Stevie on lead vocals (and also as mentioned Lindsey's background vocals). <br /> <br />The other four songs not mentioned are good songs - \\"Songbird\\", \\"Oh Daddy\\", \\"Second Hand News\\", and \\"Never Going Back Again\\".  They aren't bad tunes, but most likely if you are going to buy this album, it is going to be for one of the other 7 songs previously mentioned.  Of those four songs, I'd probably say \\"Oh Daddy\\" is the strongest. This song is a song obviously directed at Christine McVie's father.    <br /> <br />The liner notes contain some all of the lyrics and credits associated with the band and production crew.  There is a terrific picture in the band dressed in mid 70s attire - it really is retro looking.   This is Fleetwood Mac's signature album and it is one terrific effort.    The serious Mac fan will have this album - and the new Mac fan should look to this album to build their collection.
B000000OU6|3.0|IT can be hard for guitar heroes to succeed after the break up of their original bands. Hendrix hit his own share of walls after the Experience broke up, Clapton got smothered in soft rock after Cream broke up and Jimmy Paige never achieved the same musical intensity in his solo career that he did with Zeppelin. Unfortunately it seems almost as if five o clock somewhere just proves the above theory, great guitarists need equally great bands. That having been said Slash really sounds great on this album, hes still a proven riff architect and an absolutely brilliant soloist. The real problem is singer Eric Dover, and while it wouldn't be fair to compare Dover to Rose most of these songs seem to suffer more from bad songwrting choices rather then a bad vocalist. Theres way too many soft ballads and some of the melodies and phrasing seems awkward and hard to get into. Slash still proves his muscle though, ripping through blistering hard rock riffs, high intensity boogie grooves and most importantly his distinctive sound still seems to be intact.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney cannot sing. Well if she can she DOESN'T. All digitally enhanced and a bad job at that. Nothing good about this album except it is the end of her career. Nothing but a performer and she is getting worse at that. Britney needs to stop trying(to sing). She cannot perform live either. CRAP, or lower if possible......
B00028HBKC|5.0|The Passion of the Christ has been the one movie that I have been waiting to see.  It blew my mind away.  God's undying love \\"AGAPE\\" is so great and past anything that me or anyone reading this review can do to pay back.  All of our debts were paid off with Jesus Christ dying on the cross and paying for our sins with his blood.  In the movie it shows the violent death of Jesus Christ.  Ofcourse reading into the Word of God in Isiah 53 it prophesizes Jesus's death and in the New Testament books of Mark, Luke, John and Mathew it is written the events that took place that lead into this event (The Passion of The Christ) but we have to realize that Jesus died for all our sins, even the people that killed him and even for the people that until today don't believe in him.  You have to believe in the Son and know him in order to know the Father.  The Word of God is Jesus Christ.  Salvation is only through the Lord Jesus Christ.
1581804849|5.0|I loved the layout of this book.  The first 2 chapters explain the brushes and basic painting techniques with very clear pictures.  The third chapter shows you color blocks of the paint used in the book. This is very helpful if you need to match a different brand of paint. The A to Z flower projects are shown close up so the detail really shows and each project has step by step photo's of Donna building the flowers.  I loved the example pages of filler flowers and shadow leaves.  But the last part of the book on Floral Design and Composition is especially helpful to any who struggle with placement and design.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theathers last year and ever since then I been addicted to it. I don't know how Tarantino does it but he made a great movie. Yes, I'm very aware that Vol.1 and Vol.2 were suppose to be one whole movie. But Miramax split them and so we have two films. Even with the split I'm very drawn to vol.1. <br /> <br />It's been quite awhile since we seen an action heroine on the screen. Kill Bill is like no other. It delivers! These lovely femme fatales are exactly what movie goers like me enjoyed. They are vicious, violent and sometimes evil! Take a closer look at the character of O-Ren Ishii. Not only is she evil and very deadly, but also beautiful and charming. But even with that beauty a hidden wicked soul lies hidden. She is only but a victim of her own violent enviroment.  <br /> <br />The character of Gogo is very hard to analyze because she is so young and spoiled. But don't let that cute teen smile fool you! She'll cut your guts before you can even say \\"help\\".  <br /> <br />Vernita Green is the character we see less in the movie. But we come to see that she is the prime example of what the Bride is trying to achieve. <br /> <br />And now the Bride! WOW!!! Not only is the character very beautiful and sexy, but she is the reason why Kill Bill is so damn exciting! This lady takes no crap from anybody she is one mean killing machine! This woman wants revenge and anyone that is involved will pay.......with their lives. <br /> <br />Overall the movie is a must see. The DVD is a must own! I'm glad I got it and despite the fact it doesn't have much I still enjoyed the movie. Quentin Tarantino is by far a suscefull director and ignore the haters for obviously they care more about bashing him than to recognize his skills in movie making. A must have for Tarantino fans! Cheers!
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore is an insult to America. He is very manpipulative and distorts the truth on way to many aspects of american life. He has no right to go and lie to the public about our government. I would not reccommend this movie to anybody!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney's CD \\"In The Zone\\" is very well produced and written. The Ying Yang Twins and Madonna add to the success of Britney's senior album. <br />*Me Against The Music f/ Madonna - Playful and Upbeat <br />*(I Got That) Boom Boom f/ Ying Yang Twins - CRUNK and Totally New Hip-Hop Vibe from Ms. Spears <br />*Showdown - A HOTT Track w/ Hot Lyrics <br />*Breath On Me - Sexy, Danceclub Type Joint <br />*Early Mornin' - Erotic, Naughty, Late Nite Song. HOTT!! <br />*Toxic - One of the best songs on the CD. Toxic is very well produced with it's crazy violin sections <br />*Outrageous - R.Kelly produced this track which makes it all the better. Hip-Hop type Song <br />*Touch Of My Hand - Mid-tempo, Asian type guitar song <br />*The Hook Up - Jamaican influenced party song <br />*Shadow - Not the greatest, but listenable <br />*Brave New Girl - WORST SONG EVER. Too popish and very girly. <br />*Everytime - Sad, slow song with very poetic words <br />*Me Against The Music f/ Madonna [Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix] - Indian style remix, same lyrics as original <br />Britney tops herself with this CD. GO BUY IT!
B00005JNEI|5.0|I had the privilage of meeting with Michael Moore in Syracuse, NY.  He showed some of the additions on the DVD including numerous interviews with Iraqis before the illegal invasion, also were scenes from the infamous torture prison where Donald Rumsfeld ordered innocent Iraqis tortured.  There is a whole lot on this DVD that wasn't shown in the theatres which makes it a worthwhile purchase even if you have already seen the movie on the big screen.
B0002IU988|5.0|First of all , Creed were one of my favourite bands which is probably why I have an interest in Alter Bridge.I have undying respect for Scott Stapp.I think this band has saved the year for me. It tops all expectations. They've put in some serious work into this. I think there is an overall departure from the Creed sound. They're more of a hard rock outfit.Influences of grunge greats like Chris Cornell can be noticed in the new frontman's voice.He has a great vocal range and I cant wait to hear him live. Living where I live , I wont ever see Alter Bridge but I wonder how the band does live.<br /><br />  Now talking of the album it has pretty much everything for everyone.\\"Down To My Last\\" Is a song I can hear over and over again.It has this great wave of a vocal current in it. The kind you dont hear very often.<br /><br />\\"The End Is Here\\" and \\"Burn It Down\\" are another two of my favourite songs from the disc.Burn It Down reminds me of the flavored ALICE IN CHAINS(the start of the song). Sorry Layne , Myles is only a better singer. The song is like a journey of emotions.\\"The End Is Here\\" is such an awesome song. Its like the whole band is contributing. The Drums do their bit and the riffs are absolutely beautiful.<br /><br /> \\"Watch Your Words\\" and \\"Metalingus\\" are two shockers from this album. The deep layered guitaring is something I would expect from bands with a ton more talent like Dream Theater and Metallica. WATCH YOUR WORDS causes an absolute emotion of 22 emotional shockwaves to blow through me. Its what makes me feel like I have wings and I can fly. Drive to this and you'll know. Whats amazing is that Metalingus is only more addictive. \\"Metalingus\\" is where the band gives everything they've got. Words arent enough to describe the absolute favourite.\\"Fear Will Kill Me,All I could be/Lift these sorrows/Let Me Breathe/Could you set me free,could you set me free?\\" Metalingus is a winner.<br /><br />\\"Broken Wings\\" is a radio friendly song and its not like Im depreciating it by calling it that.Its a darn good loveable song.\\"In Loving Memory\\" is the one. It caused a total oblivious heart ache to me the first hundred times I heard it. Some would say its the best track on the album but I'd say this album has no best track. Every track is a winner. \\"One Day Remains\\" isnt amusing.<br /><br />Live On!Respect Unlimited @ Mark Tremonti,Myles Kennedy(my new dad),Scott Phillips and Brian Marshall.<br /><br />Apologies for the embarrasingly long review. I love Alter Bridge.Its a darn good loveable song.\\"In Loving Memory\\" is the one. It caused a total oblivious heart ache to me the first hundred times I heard it.

B000003TA4|1.0|AFI, I agree. Kurt Cobain is the most overated guitarist in existence. I mean come on you Nirvana dips*#ts, you actually think this assclown can play as better than Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and Randy Rhoads, what a bunch of dumbasses. You call us retards, is that the best you got:\\"all those retards who say Nirvana sux\\" or \\"that retard mastershake\\". If anyone is Jerry's Kids, its you guys. Just listen to this album, it sux, don't let all of those lies that mtv and vh1 spread, they're absolute crap!!!! Kurt sounds like some child rapists and plays guitar worse than a dude without hands! My 15 year-old sister(who is a huge country fan) can play guitar way better than Kurt! The bassist, gee who was he again? Oh yeah, he is such a lameass that even you hardcore fans don't know him. Dave Grohl, well he has redeemed himself with Probot but still not the best drummer in the world. I agree with you on all levels AFI except for one, Nirvana did change the face of rock'n'roll in America: They destroyed it! The once beautiful maiden face is now nothing but that of an old haggard hyena thanks to Nirvana. Now all we have is pure crap, whether new bands or some old bands using new genres. I blame Nirvana for every bad thing to happen in the 90's to today. Everything from releasing Nevermind to the creation of Nu-metal. And finally the worst thing to happen in the existence of the universe happened: St. Anger: Metallica already on its deathbed took one last breath, and then died in the most shameful and horrific ways imaginable: Nu-metal! It was one thing for Nirvana to make Nevermind, it was another thing for them to get majorly overated and forever destroy American rock, but to go to such lengths that it destroys the greatest metal band of all time, I damn Kurt Cobain and all of those jackasses that ever helped Nirvana succeed.
B00005JMX6|5.0|When I first went to see this movie, i was expecting a good humored american pie type movie. However i got way more!! This movie was not only filled with hilarious moments but also had an amazing plot. I would definately reccommend this movie to anyone.
B00008CLOA|5.0|forget CD. Forget SACD. LP is the way to go. Call me crazy, but vinyl is a billion times better than CD, at least for Dark Side anyways. The first time i listened to the CD of DSotM, i didn't think it was that great...half the songs were just weird noises as far as i could tell. But then i purchased the vinyl at a little flea market in Brazil for about 3 dollars. From the moment the needle of the old record player touched the vynil's surface to the point where it lifted on the other side, I was transported to a new world. the LP seemed to have more \\"layers\\" or something. \\"speak to me\\" and \\"on the run\\" gained a new meaning. Listening to DSotM in LP is like getting stoned without having to snort, smoke, chew or drink anything (although you can pop an acid pill to \\"enhance\\" the experience). but since it's kinda hard to find LPs in good condition and a reasonable price,and CDs are easier to handle/play you might as well get the CD, it's still an awesome trip,er... i mean musical experience.

0684833395|4.0|Joseph Heller's classic, Catch-22, is a very intriguing novel that I would suggest to anyone. Though the book is about war, extensive knowledge of history is not needed to love this book. Catch-22 is written in a different manner than other war novels. Set in WWII, the novel continually moves from the hilarity of the personal situations between the soldiers and the horrors that all involved in war face. <br /> People generally agree about the validity of WWII. Catch-22 presents a side of it that is rarely seen. Heller's protagonist, Capitan Yossarian, hates the war and takes it personally. Throughout the novel, Yossarian constantly wonders why he is risking his own life for people that will eventually die anyway. Everything has a \\"Catch-22\\"- it is impossible for him to feel that he is in the war for good reasons, but he must stay there or he will be punished. I feel that it is beneficial to see both sides of the issue. Catch-22 is very interesting in that it shows us a unique perspective that diverges from the norm.  <br />
B000002J09|1.0|These guys are more powerful than Jesus, and popular too. Gods kneel before them, so should you. Every man, woman, and child worship the ground which Led Zeppelin walks. Nothing in the history of the universe is as great as Zeppelin. I mean look at these guys: <br /> <br />1.John Bohman: Greatest drummer in history. He should be exalted as the greatest person ever to die! Zeppelin loved him so much they quit! <br />2.John Paul whatever his name is: What an awesome bass. It almost like John Enstwistle from the Who, only 9999999999999 times better. This is the voice of awesomeness. <br />3.Jimmi Paige:Oh my goodness, the greatest guitar player ever. He is so great he ripped off all the blues masters! Only Jimmi Paige would be so genious, Everyone should worship Jimmi Paige like the megagod that he is. Anyone who worships foreign guitar gods like Jimmy Hendrix, Toni Iommi, and Angus Young should die!!!!!!! <br />4.Robert Plant: The greatest of them all! Who else sounds more highpitched than a moaning woman! He makes my little sister sound like a man, anyone who sounds so girly should be given burnt sacrifices and incense. Anyone who listens to true unripful geniouses like Roger Daltrey and Ozzy Osbourne should be hanged!!!! Those two should be incinerated to the dust!!!!! Robert Plant is the megaverse!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin is the it!!!! Everything else is meaningless!!!! Its better than water, food, breathing, living, and even existing!!!!!!!! I condemn all who listen to the Who, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Pink Floyd!!!!!! This album is the greatest thing ever, mortals should bow before it, we should base our society off of all Zeppelin!!! <br /> <br />(If you believe any of this crap, go to your room, listen to some ubercrapped up overated, disgustingly overated, horible, Led Zeppelin album, cry like a little girl, and then start moaning until it sounds like you're getting screwed by an elephant, and do us all a favor and just don't exist.) <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|speaking from a totally biased point of view can usually get you places in life...if you are around the age of 12 (either you aren't educated enough to actually post a review on here, or you actually are an adult, you just simply have to be re-educated in the english department... for review credibility purposes), which basically sums up 90 percent of the \\"this album is freaking horrible\\" reviews up on this entire site. i am giving this album 5 stars... not because im a \\"punk rock\\" fan, let alone a green day fan and am comparing it to all their previous work.., not because i play the guitar, or the drums, etc. and rating the actual difficulty of the guitar-work and all that NONsense...i am giving this album 5 stars because if you actually did give this album a fair review (which is difficult to find these days)...you'd rate this album based on the simple fact that these ARTISTS created something that is THEIR OWN. this album is NOT YOURS, NOT MINE, it's their own...and with all amazing pieces of art, let alone music...personal work from an artist will always remain as the best. these guys had the guts to get their message out to the world...putting it all on the line...through their music, and mature people will understand and appreciate that.    <br />nonetheless, all lecturing aside, this album is freaking GOOD. bottom line. <br />i apoligize if you're angry...which im sure of, offending people can be quite easy on here....but yeah, honestly it doesn't really matter. <br />you can post up an argument if that makes you happy...
B0002OERI0|2.0|The album that contains some of Green Day's strongest songs is also going to be my absolute least favorite. <br /> <br />For starters, a lot of the average songs sound like GD going through the motions; power chord progressions that wind up exactly where we expect them to, exactly how we've heard them for the past--what?--15 years. And with every release, we've heard their sound strengthen and pop songwriting skills soar. <br /> <br />And now we have \\"American Idiot\\": 25% excellent, 50% expendable, 25% total crap.  <br /> <br />Superb, progressive songs such as \\"Give me Novacaine,\\" \\"The Death of St. Jimmy,\\" \\"Tales of Another Broken Home,\\" \\"City of the Damned,\\" and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends,\\" are snuffed out by the dominance of such trite b.s. as \\"Letterbomb,\\" \\"She's a Rebel,\\" and \\"Rock n' Roll Girlfriend.\\"  <br /> <br />Green Day go Genesis with \\"Are We The Waiting,\\" an anthemic yet totally benign track that is quickly dispatched by \\"St. Jimmy,\\" a Fat Wreck exercise with a bruised and long-dead horse.  <br /> <br />The lyrics, following the barely apparent storyline of Jesus of Suburbia and St. Jimmy, are as stupid as a 10th grade dropout could muster. I got a little embarassed...and I'm a FAN! <br /> <br />After all that, we get \\"Whatshername,\\" a boring b-side contender as forgettable as the girl in question. <br /> <br />Finally, we have the issue of the concept, which has been reported as a Story of Disillusioned Suburban Youths Coming of Age in Dire Circumstances. <br /> <br />Haven't they been doing that concept enough?
0060930187|3.0|It was so hard for me to read this book! To read about a 20-if-not-30-something woman who wanted to lose her virginity. She also for some reason hated herself, so much, she was writing so many ways to commit suicide. It was depressing. I've heard so many people say it is such a good book, but it is sooooo heavy. WARNING: NOT A LIGHT READING BOOK!
B00006JMQG|4.0|\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" remains possibly the most watchable of the silent films, even to those who are not silent film aficionados.  Werner Krauss's use of a landscape of obtuse angles and hand-painted shadows creates a dream-like/nightmare-like reality that is heightened by the distance and the crackling of the ancient cameras.  The characters, the enigmatic Dr. Caligari and his sinister somnambulist Cesare, are both creatures of dark corners of the imagination, and could happily hold court with Count Dracula, The Phantom of the Opera and other famous monsters of filmland.<br /><br />The storyline is equally gripping, with plot twists and turns to rival any modern film.  The innate fear of the carnival is played for all of its creepy value, as the strangers who inhabit this strange world must by their very nature carry some dark secret.  It truly is a masterpiece of any age.<br /><br />The downfall of \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" is its presentation.  As equally deserving of restoration and a \\"special edition\\" format as \\"Nosferatu\\" and \\"Metropolis,\\" there has yet to be a definitive version of this classic film.  Also dampening its effect is the soundtrack.  On the version I have, there is a sort of light jazz piano playing in the background.  If composer Philip Glass would work his magic on Caligari, the way he did on Tod Browning's \\"Dracula,\\" then this would be a powerhouse of a film.<br /><br />Kino International is releasing a new DVD of \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\\"  Although it doesn't have the newly composed soundtrack I would hope for, let's hope they work the same magic with the restoration that they did with their release of \\"Metropolis (Restored Authorized Edition).\\"
1881273156|5.0|In an effort to help mates understand how to love each other, Gary Chapman tries to organize the communication of love in five styles. He tries to help the reader understand which style(s) they respond to most, and to ask the reader to think what language the one they want to love 'hears' most clearly.<br /><br />In \\"The Five Love Languages: Five Love Languages,\\" Chapman isn't saying love only happens the way he says. Instead, he is giving a framework to love one another better. This way, we (especially we men), aren't shooting in the dark. Often, we want to love better than we do, and work hard, but miss the mark because we are, in essence, speaking another language.<br /><br />Chapman tells us that we often love the way we'd like to be loved, and that so does our spouse love us the way they'd like to be love. This can help us discover who we are, and more importantly, how we can love.<br /><br />Some romantic relationship books take the angle that men are different than women -- and that's true, but rather this a book about communications styles. In fact, he'll assert that men and women might prefer any of the five 'languages'.<br /><br />The success of this book isn't in learning the styles, but in the active use of them in our relationships. It is easy to read, but with deep consequences.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Five Love Languages: Five Love Languages\\" by Gary Chapman.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
B00000373U|5.0|I just started listening to Elliott Smith and I have to say that this album is awesome. Its dark and sad and manic depressive, yet truly beautiful. His music was weird for me at first because I hadn't heard anything like it before. I didn't really listen to it when I first bought the cd. I just thought it was some guy wispering, and I found it repetitive. That thought quickly left my mind as i listened to it more and more. I had to listen to it sort of in intervals because I couldn't stop listening to speed trials, angeles, and say yes. I am literally addicted to either/or and haven't stopped listening to it for 3 weeks. Elliott Smith can say more with a whisper than most folks can with a scream. <br /> <br />1. Speed Trials-(5/5) An awesome song. One of my favorites off the album. Raging lyrics without the raging screams. This song puts me to sleep instantly, which is a good thing. Best way to start off a masterpiece. <br /> <br />2. Alameda-(5/5) My new favorite ES song. A masterpiece with a constant state of suspense. The chorus in this song is just too awesome. You'll be hitting the rewind button as it goes into the chorus. <br /> <br />3. Ballad Of Big Nothing-(5/5) Cool song but its not my favorite. The guitar is really cool and I like the layed back lyrics. Not as depressing as the rest of the cd. <br /> <br />4. Between The Bars-(5/5) My favorite song off the cd. A ridiculously good song. People you've been before that you don't want around anymore. If I haven't fallen asleep yet, this is where I dose off (again, a good thing). <br /> <br />5. Pictures Of Me-(5/5) Not exactly my favorite but I still love this song. Especially when it swears. I usually don't like music with cussing cause it ruins the song. But theres something about Elliott's voice that just adds so much more power and emotion to the song. <br /> <br />6. No Name No.5-(4/5) Not my favorite song off the cd but it's really good. I haven't listened to it really in depth yet cause i'm still tiedup with the rest of the cd but its good. <br /> <br />7. Rose Parade-(4/5) It's a cool song but not my favorite. His voice is beatiful on this song.  <br /> <br />8. Punch And Judy-(4/5) My least favorite song. Good but It's just not as exciting as the rest of the song. <br /> <br />9. Angeles-(5/5) One of my favorites off the cd. Quick finger picking earns the song instant respect in my mind. <br /> <br />10. Cupids Tricks-(5/5) This song again shows how good ES is at songwriting. The chorus will get stuck in your head just after one listen and you'll sing it the whole day. <br /> <br />11. 2:45-(5/5) A beautiful song all around. <br /> <br />12. Say Yes-(5/5) Definately on to my list of favorites. It's just unbelievably beautiful and a perfect way to end the cd.
068987474X|1.0|H.L. Mencken once said: to every complex problem there is a simple solution--and that simple solution is INVARIABLY WRONG.  <br />  <br />I agree. This is just another of those pop-psychology books that holds that a few versions of a simple statement (\\"he's not that into you\\") has an application in every situation. Nevermind that the author does not hold a Doctorate, Masters, or even a Bachelors in Psychology. Nevermind that he would've flunked Psychology 101. Nevermind that the only reason his book is a bestseller is because of the Oprah Factor. <br /> <br />The truth of the matter is that we men are just as complex as you women are. The author simplifies his own sex, based on his own simplicity and that of the men around him (all his evidence is anecdotal). But even if 95% of men out there really are mindless robots, 5% of us are thinking, feeling human beings, which is, after all, the kind of man you women want. That kind of man does not follow the childish, immature behavior this author lays out, and if you behave like how the author tells you to, he won't be interested in you. <br /> <br />Let me give you an example. Soon after I met a girl, a good friend of mine died. As a result, the girl was a low priority for me and I really didn't pay attention to her. If she had said \\"He's not that into me,\\" we would've went our separate ways and never seen each other again. Instead, she called me, asked me out on a date, and then asked me what was wrong. It was a sincere, touching gesture, and I never forgot it. In fact, she is my girlfriend now, and every step of the way she had communicated with me with the same sincereity and emotional grace. That's the way to win over a man. <br /> <br />Ignore this book and all other books that claim to teach you the \\"secret\\" or \\"rules\\" to fullfilling relationships. Be gracious with yourself and the people around you, and communicate with sincereity. Then maybe you find that dream guy some day.  <br /> <br />As for me, I'm taken.
B0002S94OS|5.0|First off, you can't go into listening to this album expecting the same as you got in New American Gospel and As the Palaces Burn.  This album straight up rocks.  Lamb of God administers some new rhythm between their guitars and drums, with some really cool breakdowns and time changes.  I have to admit, when I saw them promoting the new album at Ozzfest, the songs they played from this album didn't sound very impressive live.  I went and bought the CD, and was pleasantly surprised.  If you liked their last albums, or if you are trying to pick a CD by Lamb of God to check them out, pick up this one.
068987474X|1.0|The author has several logical fallacies in this book.  It is truly awful how popular this book has become.  The following are the logical fallacies that hopefully anyone who reads this book will be able to recognize (or just avoid buying this entirely to save your brain cells): <br /> <br />1.  Confirmation Bias  - He only accepts opinions and examples from those that agree with him and dismisses all others.  One cannot build a sound basis for understanding male behavior from only people who agree with your preexisting theory.  <br /> <br />1a.  Statistical Sampling Error - He limits his observations to those he is acquainted with.  There are more men on earth than the ones that live in his neighborhood.  Also, there are just a bunch of anecdotes strung together in this book.  There is no empirical research.  He wouldn't even know how to conduct research.  As he said on Oprah, \\"he's just a dude.\\" <br /> <br />2.  Apples & Oranges - Just because he found the love of his life and called her and treated her great does not mean that ANYONE else on earth will be in this same situation.  Conversely, just because he treated women badly does not mean all men go through life playing those games and treating women badly. He is comparing himself to ALL men - One apple to a LOT of oranges. <br /> <br />3.  Appeal to the imaginary - The idea of the soulmate is something that is created by the movies / media and perpetuated in this book.  Though there is no (and never will be any) proof that anyone has a soulmate, the author's conclusions are based entirely on the fact that \\"when you find the soulmate, he will not treat you badly.\\"  Since the soulmate is an imaginary concept, one cannot expect to find him.  Most people in this world are be forced to compromise into relationships with people that are less than their ideal since there is only 1 denzel washington to go around.  He refuses to accept that anyone has to compromise - further perpetuating the unrealistic and unhealthy expectation that everyone is going to find their \\"perfect match\\" <br /> <br />4.  Reduced Complexity is not Accuracy - To give people another 1-liner that will supposedly solve all their problems  like \\"Don't eat Fat,\\"  \\"Don't Eat Carbs,\\"  \\"He's just not that into you,\\" is not an accurate thing to do.  Whether it is weight loss or relationships, no issue is so simple as to be reduced to 1 line - yet we all wish it was.  So, we're very tempted to buy into it.  Yes, there are times when carbs are bad for you or when \\"he just isn't into you,\\" but accepting this black & white 1-line ideology to solve a complex issue can do more harm than good. <br /> <br />5.  What Cause is Has What Effect -  The author's life changed dramatically in the time between his poor treatment of women to now when he he treated his \\"soulmate\\" well.  The fact that he found this amazing woman may not be the only \\"cause\\" for the \\"effect\\" (the \\"effect\\" being the fact he treats her well.)  He made a lot of money and considerable time passed here as well.  He frequently uses examples that men say they are \\"too busy\\" for relationships, and that this is a falsehood  Well, before he made his big bucks, I have to assume he was quite busy as well trying to make it in Hollywood.  After establishing himself, he had more free time, correct?  So, his security and income is what made him available to treat a woman well.  Yes, he met a great woman, but can we conclude that the woman alone inspired his behavioral change?  No.  Too much changed during his lifetime.  So, when he implies that men who say they are \\"too busy\\" are lying - one simply has to look at his life and understand that driven men who are in the early phases of their careers ARE going to be more busy than those that are established. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this is yet another pop culture book that will sell like mad yet has absolutely nothing of value.
B0000584V3|5.0|This cd never leaves my stereo.I am a hugh fan of black metal etc.Opeth is in a class to them selves!As songwriters they are brilliant.You can tell they love what they're doing.And they do it well!I have to say this cd ranks in my top 10 of all time.So much depth and layers to this cd.Why do so many great bands go unnoticed,while so many crappy bands are prospering?
B0002S943O|4.0|I was hyped when I read about this release. I got it last night, and  watched it all the way through. The good news: the sound is great, most of the songs use alternate arrangements ( or mixes, if you prefer ) which is a nice change from listening to the Faith and Devotion cd ( I especially like the revamped \\"Everything Counts\\", it has a funk, a grit, that it never had before ). The visuals are spare, they enhance but do not distract from the concert. Dave Gahan is in strong voice ( wailing like a bluesman,  he sings the heck out of Condemnation, one of my all time favourites, unlike the newer version on the  One Night in Paris dvd, where he croons  Condemnation in a slow, more controlled, almost \\"lounge-act\\" kind of way .) Now the bad news : the \\"extras\\" one disc two are just not that special. The videos are most all   available on \\"the Videos 86-98 +\\" DVD. The projections I can already see on the regular part of the concert on disc one. The interview with Anton Corbijn is of little or no consequence. The two bonus concert tracks should have been put on the first disc, where they belong. The only thing I really enjoyed is the documentary, although it is too short. I would have liked to have seen more behind the scenes things, like in the \\"101\\" DVD, but I didn't direct or put this film together, so griping about it is futile. And as I never had the original  Devotional VHS, I cannot comment on other reviewers saying the film itself looks \\"grainy\\". A few minor gripes aside, this is an outstanding release, showcasing Depeche Mode at their performance peak.

B00023B1LC|5.0|The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy rocks! I want this DVD! The storylines, the suspense, the twists, everything about these movies are incredible! 5 stars for both of them! Incredible.
B00005JNEI|5.0|It doesn't matter that this is one side of the story because there is plenty of propaganda for the other side as well. Funny, I saw it after it had been out a while and the first thought that came to mind after it ended was that the general news is now reporting the same material. So, the movie may not be so surprising now. As a matter of fact, there is now enough material since its release for a sequel! :-)
B0002OERI0|5.0|Before I begin I have to mention that I'm a die hard Green Day fan.  From Going to Pasalaqua, to Basket Case, To Geek Stink Breath, To Time of Your Life Green Day's always impressed me, and this is no exception.  The one thing that was worrying me was that the majority of Warning was too simplistic and safe, and I thought I had them figured out, and anticipated more of the same.  But gladly, I was wrong.  This is nothing like the 2000 released Warning, and adds a fresh spin to the words \\"Green Day\\".  With many fast paced hits in the making my other cds will be jealous of how much spin time it's getting.  Simply put, Green Days proved once again that they're unmatched in recent Pop-Punk music, and continue to keep music fresh.  Buy it.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|When I saw Live Aid (in New Zealand), they kept crossing to a panel of celebs in the local TV studio who were imploring everyone to give more money; finally we'll now be able to see most of the show without this annoyance.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|After the tumble of \\"The Ragpicker's dream\\", with at most a few good songs, Mark Knopfler comes back shining bright, maybe more than ever. In \\"Shangri-La\\" he gives a record full of wonderful and meaningful songs. Though there are a lot to pick up on this record, I would highlight \\"5.15 am\\" about coal miners in England and \\"Back to Tupelo\\" as especially evocative. I have never heard a song to Elvis as beautiful, emotive and sung with such empathy as \\"Back to Tupelo\\". The most remarkable thing of \\"Shangri-La\\" might be a Knopfler showing further improvement at the command of lyrics and messages in complex matters.
1577312082|5.0|I bought the CD version of \\"The Power of Now\\" as a recommendation from my therapist.  \\"The Power of Now\\" is definitely not a book for people who just started to discover who they are and who they want to be.  It is not a book that gives you a simple framework about how to start living a happy life.  There is no simple framework to live a satisfied life.  To start, I recommend reading Don Miguel Ruiz's books.  They are easier to understand.    The book/CD suggests we live in the presence, put all our mind and thoughts in \\"now\\", can we strike for doing the best we can on everything we does and break away from suffering (which tends to focus on the past and the future).  Only when we break from the past and the future, can we learn to love and be less judging (because judgment tends to come from the past or from the fear that something terrible will happen in the future).  And harsh judgment, ultimately, robs our happiness because we become bitter and unforgiving.       This book is an advance guide for those who has been in search of deepening their spiritual life.  I admit it takes a lot of hard work and re-reading/re-listening to deepen the understanding of what the author realized for the 10 years he was in search for the truth.  Each time you read the book/listen to the CD, it is a deep spiritual awakening process.  The words from the author can only be experienced.  It is what it is.  We are who we are.  It is about acceptance and experiencing the presence.  I am truly amazed how the words have inspired me the second time I am listening to it.  These set of CD is meant to be listened over and over again.  Then, one day you will realize you are detached all forms exist in the external world.  However, you will still find the unconditional love, acceptance and peace inside you at the present time.  That is the power of this set of CDs.  Enjoy and may you experience the awakening yourself.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Hey everybody if you don't have this album, shame on you. Weezer is one of the best bands ever, and the blue album is incredible. Every song is great, plus theres a new CD of new stuff that is way awsome too. All of their music sounds original and seriously, who can't like a band named WEEZER? Anyway, I found out that weezer is coming out with a new album in spring of 2005, so all of you better go to their next tour which ahould be next summer, and buy (not burn) their record. Also if you have any questions about how cool Weezer is then please email me. Trust me, I have good taste in music because I'm a music major. I listen to it all. By the way, every other weezer album is great too, so spend the money and get them all if you can. Personally I like the blue and the green best, but thats hard to judge for everybody. In conclusion, great great album, so buy it. You'll never get tired of it.
B000089RVX|3.0|I was so stoked to get this cd and when I did, I was a little dissapointed. It seemed that they try to hard to be cool! I loved Bring me to Life but some of the others just felt like it was the same throughout each song! I don't know, it is still a good Cd , it is just that there is something about it that makes it not so good!
B00028HBKM|1.0|If you want to view an interpretation of Christ that reduces him to little more than a helpless idiot, watch this movie.  If you actually respect him, avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing, then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here, he is portrayed as a victim, dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there, just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message, love, pacificm, or teachings, it's a sensationalist view of his suffering, which doesn't fit well with the Christ story.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The screenplay was excellent.  Sure, parts were trimmed, but that's what has to be done to bring most books to the silver screen.  The thing that struck me as most irksome about the movie was... well... THE MOVIE.  It had the look of typical British television.  It didn't have the aura of magic and mystery that was so evident in the first two movies.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban looked like it was shot on video tape instead of 35mm filmstock.      Another rather unsettling aspect of the film was the director's disregard for what had been established in the first two films.  The \\"exterior shots\\" were so completely different from those of the previous films as to be distracting.  What purpose could he possibly have had for relocating Hagrid's hut to the bottom of some big hill?  Fans of HP 1 & 2 could walk to Hagrid's blindfolded: straight through the archway, down the path across the grounds to the edge of the Dark Forrest.  And WHAT was up with that lame excuse for the Dark Forrest???  My back yard is creepier than that sad location he used.  I kept expecting to see Hobbits wandering around in there!    When I saw the first Harry Potter movie, I was amazed at how much the film looked like the pictures I had formed in my head while reading the books.  This time, the director got it all wrong.  Like I said earlier, it looked like British television instead of the magical fantasyland we've come to expect.  What if George Lucas had suddenly stopped using the Millenium Falcon that we've all come to know so well, and started using the old LOST IN SPACE flying saucer ship instead?  Yuck!    So, 3 stars for an excellent screenplay that was poorly handled by a new director.  Hopefully, Chris Columbus will be back for Goblet of Fire.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban makes me homesick for MY Hogwarts.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Obviously Michael is opinionated and he raises a lot of questions. A lot of people trash this movie as being a tool of the left wing. But I have yet to hear any rebuttals to his facts as they are presented, just bashing. But any open minded, clear thinking AMERICAN will walk away from this movie thinking. YOu will laugh you will be moved but you also wonder. An excellent documentary!
B0000696I1|1.0|If you like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and are not a young child, you will despise this movie. I remember renting this movie when it came out and disliking it quite a bit, but I could never remember why. My brother and I were watching the first movie in the trilogy, and he asked how much TMNT 3 would cost. It was only a couple bucks, so I figured what the heck and got it. As soon as I put it in, I remembered why I hated it, all those years ago. This move had a lot to live up to, as the first two TMNT movies are some of the best films ever. Unfortunately it fails in everyway possible.    The biggest problem with this movie is the characters. Nearly all of them act much differently then they should. This is especially noticeable in Raphael and Donatello. Raphael acts, for lack of a better term, \\"goody-goody\\" in this movie, and he befriends a young boy, Yoshi. It's not to say that that is inherently a bad thing, but it's not at all how he normally acts, and the scenes with Yoshi feel completely unnatural. It's like they were just added to teach any kids watching a lesson. He also throws his sais at enemies, and in the other films he was very protective of them. Very inconsistent. Donatello is considerably dumbed down for most of the movie and becomes smart only at oppourtune moments. April is much more ditzy than she has been in the other films. Casey is only concerned with fighting and not with the motives behind the fight. He's supposed to be a vigilante, fighting for justice. Splinter is way more strict than he has been and generally less solemn than expected. The European and Japanese characters feel very awkward as well. The only characters that are well done are Leonardo, Michaelangelo, and the traitor to the Europeans. On a side note, the Turtles and Splinter look much less realistic than they did in the first two movies, and it makes you wonder why they changed the look at all.    The plot is also fairly unbelievable. April comes to the Turtles' lair with anartifact from 17th Century Japan, which she acquired from a flea market. The item sends her to Japan and a Japanese warrior returns. April gets captured and the Turtles decide to rescue her. When they make the trip to Japan, 4 more Japanese warriors take their place. Casey has to babysit the Japanese men, and the turtles have to find a way to return to the present. They also have to deal with some Europeans who are hurting the Japanese people. That's really all there is to the movie, and it's completely predictable. The only twists are when one of the Europeans(played by the same actor as Casey) helps the turtles and then betrays them, but you could even see that coming.    The dialogue is ridiculously bad and often very childish. Practically everything said is unbelievable and only included to get a laugh from the kids, which is part of why the characters act so different from how they normally do. Sure, the turtle's made jokes in the first two films, but those jokes were actually fairly intelligent, and served as relief. Here the action relieves the jokes.    I also find it annoying that the Japanese people speak in perfect English. This takes place in the 17th century. Everyday Japanese people aren't going to know English. Very few speak it well even in modern times. I have nothing against them, but it seems ridiculous that their English wasn't at least a little broken. Even the little boy, Yoshi, spoke English perfectly. On the other hand, the Japanese warriors with Casey didn't seem to have a good grasp on English at all. It's another huge inconsistency.    The Casey segments are painful. The warriors that were sent to the present act like kids, and Casey tries to teach them about modern culture, particularly hockey. I guess this was supposed to be funny, but I can't see anyone over the age of 10 enjoying this section.    A final pet peeve is that the cast is almost entirely different from the first two. Apirl is different again, and the turtles and Splinter sound much different than they did in the first two. Casey is the only returning actor. This wouldn't be a big deal, but the change is for the worse. I guess the original actors saw that this wasn't going to be good, and didn't want to get involved.    To the movie's credit, the scenery in the movie looks great. I doubt it was filmed in Japan, but it looks close enough. The soundtrack and fighting are also fairly decent. None of these things can rescue the movie, though.    I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 10. The entire point of this movie was to make a family oriented movie with lots of jokes for kids and that's not what TMNT's about, and the makers obviously could have cared less about pleasing older fans of the series. It really feels like they were just in it for a quick buck. It's a shame, because if they had just put more work into the story and gotten better talents, this could have been a decent movie. I'd only recommend this to people with small children.
B0001A79JO|4.0|I've been listening to this album for a couple of days now and I'm really digging it.  Its bouncy and fun.  There's enough variation in the tracks so that they don't all sound the same and the energy is good.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it is so catchy and so \\"pop\\" that I'm afraid I'll get burned out on it.  I'm not sure why some people wrote that they liked the first half of the album but not the second half.  \\"Dotted With Hearts\\" has a great sound, like listening to music from \\"Grease\\" with power.  The surf sound of \\"Horrorbeach\\" is cool and \\"Emotional Abuse\\" is really sultry.  Well, everyone is different.  I'd recommend this album.  I've sent copies to a couple other people already.
B00005JNEI|3.0|While not a perfect documentary (very one-sided), Moore delivers.  I've read many reviews on this site that have argued the film is not factual and is blatant lie.  Do some research on your own before spouting the words of the talking heads on Fox News Channel or any other overtly Republican organization.  I would be willing to bet, based on the content of several of the negative reviews on this site, at least 80% of the people have not seen this film.  Most of the facts in this movie are supported by many sources, including: The 9/11 Commission Report, The House of Saud, and Against All Enemies (Richard Clarke).   <br /> <br />While I don't agree with some of Moore's labor-related ideals or some of his more elaborate conspiracy theories, I believe that there is something better for this country, and George W. Bush is not it.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I didn't really get into Seinfeld until it went off the air, but now that TBS shows it every night for an hour, sometimes for two, I can't get enough of it. From yada yada yada-to the soup nazi episode. It is hillarious. You have to wonder how George got a date sometimes, because he was so moody, but he was one of my favorite characters, he told it how it was. Jerry was always the one to pay because he was a \\"minor\\" celebrity, Kramer was always full of nervous energy, and Elaine was always gorgeous. If it wasn't how she looked, it was her wonderful acting abilities. I love this show, and I know it took a long time to come out, but when it does, I will be standing in line for my copy. Excellent comic relief after a day full of hassles, watch a comedy about nothing!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|When I first saw this movie advertised I was like, what the hell is that? Then my friend made me go see it with him and from the first second all the way through I was hysterical. YOu can't get enough of how unbelievably hilarious this guys' personality is. The tater tots was the best part in my opinion. If you are open minded and want to see a brand new kind of humorm or at least to me, then definitley check this one out you will love it.
B0000399WI|5.0|This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I was told by many people to watch it long after the release. Finally I broke down and rented it. What an amazing movie. Tim Robbins is intelligent in every movie he does, but this one is at the height of his career. Tim Robbins potrays a man wrongfully accused of killing his wife and lover. Through his many attempts to prove his innocence, none have worked. He befriends Morgan Freeman, a man that knows the streets and the ins and outs. Their friendship provides strength to get through the many years they serve in prison. Excellent movie, excellent ending, a must have. It has been added to my own personal blockbuster!
0345409671|5.0|Ok, for all the people who wrote that this book is a waste of time, they are horibbly wrong!  Either they are very religious and they don't enjoy having their strict beliefs questioned, or they don't want to think about the concept that Anne Rice brings to attention.  She is giving an explination to the unkown, beacuse truly, no one can be 100% sure about all of this, unless they have seen or spoken to God or His angels.  <br />Seriously though, it is a very smart thesis and there is a lot of evidence to support it.  <br /> <br /> <br />Why does God allow such horrible things to happen, when He could stop them with His power, which is unmeasurable?  <br />Why does He test us the way He does? If He does indeed know everything, wouldn't he know what we think and how we feel about things?  <br /> <br />If that is so, wouldn't the all the extra hardships be unecessary, if He already knows our hearts? Why would He let us be tortured to prove our faith?  <br /> <br />
B0002VKZL6|5.0|This CD will take you time to appreciate.  At first listen I thought \\"elevator music\\" -- rock so light it isn't rock.  It takes a while to appreciate the subtleties and the quiet, quiet songs.  (The reviewer who said this was Knopfler's most rocking effort since Dire Straits days obviously had never heard the CD. The only semi-rocking song is \\"Boom like That\\")  <br />  <br />              The CD also lacks the variety of recent Knopfler efforts.  Gone are the Celtic, Country, Cajun, and Folk tunes that dotted his other CDs.  Instead, \\"Shangri-la\\" is just six guys -- two guitars, a bass, a piano, an organ, and drums, sitting around playing relaxed songs.  The CD gets my top rating for good lyrics, interesting tunes, virtuoso instrumentation, perfectionist fussiness, and Knopfler's voice, which sounds a little smoother with age than his usual Dylanesque gruffness.  It's not a CD that inspires superlatives, and none of the songs will likely go to the top of the hit parade, but they're good -- every one of them.  Some of them even have a little bit of a surf sound, reflecting perhaps the fact that the CD was recorded in California     <br /> <br />          Still, I can appreciate the opinion of those who say \\"Shangri-la\\" is boring.  I yearn for one of Knopfler's great guitar solos like the screamers on \\"Telegraph Road,\\" the chugging \\"Sultans of Swing,\\" or the smoky country blues of \\"You and your Friend.\\"  No such luck.  Are Knopfler's rocking days over?  I guess we'll have to be content with what we get.         <br /> <br />
B00062IDCO|5.0|I joined the great journey of voyager for the Episode \\"Rennasance Man\\" (am i qualified to write this review) anyway, ever since then i watched voy any time it was on, i even stayed up till 11 if i had to. The fact is is that it is the best series. They all have their good and bad sides (enterprise is mostly bad) but voy is the best. The only mistake paramount made was waiting too long to release some of the seasons and now have to realease 2 within 2 weeks. Nice one Guys! lol
B00003CXCT|4.0|BUT why did they change the movies, i mean Han Solo not shooting that guy in the bar first was like a very important part of his character. His whole part in the movie was like himself redeeming himself for all his wrong doings. and the return of the jedi, without the ewok song. WTH. i maen they play that other music right over it, why did he change the movies, i thought this was supposed to be the original movies, not the special edition.<br /><br />I mean i love the movies all of them, even the new ones, but changing the old ones so that we have no choice; eg. this will be the only DVD release of the movie, why'd he do that. Its like not fair, i wanted to watch it in its original entirety and now i have to go back to the VHS tapes to see stuff the way it was.<br /><br />I meanthe movies are freaking awesome on DVD and they look suberb its just that, i liked them the way they were so much. blah. maybe i'm just being way to critical, i'm sure i'll probably watch it just as many times as i've watched it on VHS before. and with the special features its really keeps things interesting.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|On paper, the idea of a remastered \\"Let It Be\\" is nothing less than heaven-sent for Beatle fans. The result seems to have caused some controversy, because when \\"...Naked\\" came out many listeners objected to the polished sound (which contradicted the nature of the Get Back sessions), the exclusion of \\"Maggie Mae\\" and \\"Dig It,\\" and other general gripes such as the often-heard argument (which also happens to be completely invalid) that it's another attempt by Paul to re-write history.<br /><br />I am speaking as a serious Beatle fan, and I believe that the new version is indeed much better than the Spector version, with a few exceptions. This might be a heretical idea to some, but it shouldn't, and here's why.<br /><br />1) Across The Universe. Although all versions of this song are good, this is the stand-out track on the album. Played at regular speed and devoid of the strange production, it is merely Lennon and an acoustic guitar, and it makes for some of the most beautiful and touching listening that one can be blessed with.<br /><br />2) For You Blue, I've Got A Feeling, and One After 909 all sound amazing. The mixes on the latter two are simply incredible - they allow Billy Preston's keyboard and especially Ringo's drums to punch through and take over the songs. Also, although I prefer the Beatles/George Martin single version most of all, it is a blessing that George's horrid overdubbed album solo on Let It Be is gone. I Me Mine is also done justice by removing the unnecessary orchestration.<br /><br />3) The album is tight, flows well, and is even helped by the non-inclusion of the chatter and the two short songs, and the addition of a very decent rooftop version of Don't Let Me Down. The album does indeed sound like a finished record, but it was done right, done cleanly and to the benefit of most of the songs.<br /><br />The only legitimate gripe about the new version is The Long And Winding Road. If there was one track on the Spector version that I absolutely loved, it was this one. Call me strange, but I've been listening to this song forever and it has gained a place in my heart the way it was. The new version is, simply put, absolute crap - it even includes a crucial change in lyric that completely changes the meaning of the song, which is simply inexcusable. Not to mention the quality of the playing, which is lazy and near abysmal.<br /><br />The version of Long And Winding Road (which remains in my top 5 Beatles songs) on \\"Anthology 3\\" truly does the song justice - it is the Spector vocal track with no additional production and it is remarkably gorgeous and touching in its simplicity. On \\"...Naked,\\" it's not.<br /><br />The second (minor) gripe is the cover, which is uninspired, one might say even ugly, and the title (how about a release of the original Get Back sleeve?).<br /><br />But the real reason that Beatle fans should purchase this disc is the 20-minute Get Back sessions bonus disc. Some have complained, but true Beatlemaniacs know this is the real gem. Here we have a 1:32 min.(!) version of Because I Know You Love Me So, one of the rarest and most beautiful unreleased early Lennon-McCartney compositions. You also get bits of All Things Must Pass (harmonized by the Beatles in a bittersweet indication of what might have been), and Child Of Nature (the prequel to Jealous Guy and just as amazingly good).<br /><br />The Get Back sessions were definitely the most interesting time in the Beatles' history, because they were in their transitional 1969 stage, and yet went back to their very earliest roots and performed hundreds of covers, standards, and unreleased demos and old songs, as well as previews of Abbey Road and their solo careers. For anyone lucky to get their hands on the complete sessions bootlegs, it is simply a treasure trove of music. And despite the bitter conflicts which were admittedly there, the music was the purest and most true to themselves, and to rock and roll, that they ever recorded since the beginning. \\"Fly On The Wall\\" is not much, but it's a breathtaking window into that world, and it is what makes the remastered \\"Let It Be\\" worth its price.t much, but it's a breathtaking window into that world, and it is what makes the remastered \\"Let It Be\\" worth its price.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore presents some pretty damning evidence. Believe it or don't. It's up to you. But the least you can do is watch the film. Who knows, maybe you'll decide to do some research of your own if your still skeptical. That's what this country needs: People who question and research and don't just accept things at face value.
B00004RF9B|5.0|WHY YOU SHOULD VIEW THIS: <br /> <br />This is a very suspenseful and entertaining film. It will appeal to both adults and children and with a \\"G\\" rating, makes for a great family video night. Adults will enjoy the mature themes and will be compelled by the well-developed plot. Children will instantly fall for Robby the Robot and enjoy the special effects. The violence is kept to a minimum and is mostly off-screen. This is a great film to use to introduce children to the world of adult speculative fiction. Too many of their choices consist of situations driven by shallow plot devices, overly-expository villains whose vocabulary is littered with phrases such as \\"you fool!\\" or \\"the universe/planet/pokemon is now mine!\\" and bland heroes lacking any concept of self-awareness. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Although a landmark film, this was still made in the 50's and as such, many of the characters are under-developed or even clich. The techno-futuristic soundtrack sounds like it was created by bending a two-man saw and is about as fun to experience as a pap-smear.  <br /> <br />Even with these minor shortcomings, there is really only one scenario we could think of in which a person would pass on this film. If you are about to be stranded on a deserted island and are given the choice of only one film, then by all means, this is probably not the one you will take. All in all, however, we gave this a 6 so make your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
B00005JNEI|5.0|I don't understand people who are constantly talking about the \\"horror of propaganda\\" that is this movie. Sure, it is propaganda. Of course it is. But, do you watch the news? read the newspaper? watch commercials? It is all propaganda; one little piece added to the massive pile is not something to be up in arms about. Good for you if you see the manipulation and obvious techniques Moore uses, but is that really cause to degrade the film? No one is up in arms about CNN or his or her own local broadcasts or newspapers. When that occurs, I will begin to take such criticism as somewhat valid. <br />
B000001EHS|5.0|This is one of the best \\"Best of\\" cd's I have ever heard. And unfortunatly is being deleted from Def Leppards Catalogue, which means once all the new copies are sold, they will not reproduce this CD ever again, due to the new \\"Best of\\" being released and double cd \\"Best of\\" being released in very limited numbers. So if you are fan like me, who collects all the cd's. It is a must to have !
B0002MPU1K|5.0|The few bars played on line were not enough to sell me. Thank Heavens I heard the whole cut on Jay Leno last night. You need a few more bars on line to get into the song.   Apart from  being eye candy, he has a great voice, a full background of instruments, and great arrangements.  I  think he is wonderful, and really think his youth and talent could bring even my 15 year old to appreciate really great music.
B0000DBJ2B|3.0|I final saw this film for the first time.  Directed by Jim henson the creator of the muppets.  Dark Crystal takes place in the ancient midle evil land.

Full of action an adventure this is a decient movie. If you like this I recomend Labrinth
B0002OERI0|5.0|Remember when \\"Warning\\" came out and everybody said that Green Day had finally matured and grown up? Well, \\"American Idiot\\" is even more of a step in the same direction. However, it also a step in a completely different direction as well. Confused? Understandable, but I'll break it down song by song like most others do.    1. \\"American Idiot\\" - Common Green Day radio fodder. A little bit more politically driven (obviously) than a lot of the other singles they've released. Not the greatest, but a solid single...which is the purpose of it: a single    2. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" (Listed in the track listing as 5 separate songs, but it's not) - Who would've thought Green Day would go opera? Well, the music isn't, but the song style is. The storyline is actually quite compelling and makes for an excellent song. One of my favorites.    3. \\"Holiday\\" - Not a bad song, not a great song either. Really hard to classify it, but it sounds like it could've easily been on \\"Warning\\" or maybe a B-side.    4. \\"Boulevarde of Broken Dreams\\" - Ok, the song is cliche, get over it. You can't expect a band to come up with completely new ideas all the time. Really, this is a very good song...very hummable. Got it stuck in my head for days after I heard it. I wouldn't be surprised if it was released as a single.    5. \\"Are We the Waiting\\" - \\"Band Aid\\" anyone? You can't help but think \\"We Are the World\\" when you hear it. My least favorite song on the album by far.    6. \\"St. Jimmy\\" - Interesting...back more in the style of classic Green Day: fast and hard. A lot of people don't like it because of the lyrics, but really, it's more of a set-up (I'll explain later) I, on the other hand, enjoy this one.    7. \\"Give Me Novacaine\\" - Slow, progressive rocker. Starts quiet, picks up. Wasn't one of my favorites to start with, but it grew on me.    8. \\"She's A Rebel\\" - Generic Green Day song. Not much here, ok to hear once in a while.    9. \\"Extrodinary Girl\\" - Kind of an experimental song...a little weird, but ok. Not one of my faves, though.    10. \\"Letterbomb\\" - This is another one of those \\"set-up\\" songs. Again, I like this one, but a lot of other don't.    11. \\"Wake Me When September Ends\\" - Ok, basically an even softer song in the mold of \\"Macy's Day Parade.\\" It's alright, but definitely not the type of song I got the album for.    12. \\"Homecoming\\" (Again listed as 5 separate songs, but it's all one) - And now we come to the big one. My favorite of the record. Remember those \\"set-up\\" songs? Well this is what they we're setting up. A lot of the music to this point was the continuing story after \\"Jesus of Suburbia.\\" Listen the WHOLE WAY THROUGH, otherwise, you probably won't get all of it. There's gotta be 20 different references to other songs all on this album. It's really easy to understand why it's called \\"Homecoming.\\" (Oh, and to get the idea behind \\"Rock and Roll Girlfriend\\", just think about the movie Grease. Definitely the most unliked part of the album by most, but if you think about it, it does fit in, so just take it for what it's worth.)    13. \\"Whatsername\\" - I was confused on why they wrapped up the album with this. I would've switched it with \\"Homecoming\\", mainly because there are a couple references to this song in it, so you really don't get them right away. Decent song, but kind of anti-climactic.    And there you have it: the anatomy of \\"American Idiot.\\" It really is a story the whole way through. The real way to enjoy the album is to basically forget what you know about Green Day (yes, for a short time you must forget \\"Dookie\\") and listen to it objectively. It really is an amazing record.
B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard's Hysteria is quite possibly one of the most successful and greatest albums of all time. After a four year studio silence, and nothing less than an excellent Pyromania, Leppard fans were getting hysterical for a new album. Talk was even in the air between record label executives, questioning whether or not Def Leppard could actually play live. So, the anticipation was enormous for Hysteria. Especially with the return of drummer Rick Allen after losing his left arm in a car accident. <br /> <br />On to the songs. <br /> <br />Women -- Obviously, the opening song on the CD says everything about Def Leppard's favorite topic to write songs about. This song is great, it's a bit slow but both the main riff and chorus are so melodic and sad sounding it almost makes you want to cry. Awesome song overall. <br />Rocket -- This is a really long one. Great vocal harmonies and the catchiest beat make this song alive every single time you listen to it. <br />Animal -- One of the big songs. Also one of the many with the sing-along, gang vocal choruses. Mid paced and pleasing to the ear, I love this song. <br />Love Bites -- Every last band of the 80s needs to have at least one ballad. This is Def Leppards most famous ballad, and probably the best constructed one too. As all go, it's slow, harmonious, and a heart breaker. <br />Pour Some Sugar On Me -- Chart topper, #1 hit, probably the most popular and well known song Def Leppard ever put out. It has the most un-mistakable sound, it's heavy and jumpy and suggestive. I have grown to consider it another song among many on the album, but this is only because I have heard it endless times on the radio and on TV. But it's still a monumental song. <br />Armageddon It -- Another big radio hit. EXTREMELY catchy, and the guitar work of Steve Clark and Phil Collen is amazing. <br />Gods Of War -- This song kind of lurks in the shadows of the other songs on the album. Although not very popular when released, its still a great well structured song to listen to, and just as good quality of all the other ones. The lyrical content is similar to Die Hard the Hunter; anti-war. <br />Don't Shoot Shotgun -- I have still yet to figure out the meaning of the lyrics in this song. However, it's wonderfully paced and at a great tempo, perfect chorus to sing along to. I love this song. <br />Run Riot -- My favorite song on the album. It's fast, well sung, well played, and very fun. I can't get enough of this song, the chorus backing vocals are excellent behind the main ones, and the verses are raw and smooth-flowing. My favorite. <br />Hysteria -- This is the quiet, mid-range slower tempo song of the album. The guitars are almost always clean, and the parts are just great. The overall mood of the song is similar to the opening song and commonly found in great Def Leppard hits. <br />Excitable -- No matter what situation you are ever in, if you listen to this song it will make you forget about your troubles and want to get up and party. The opening words \\"Stand up... Say YEAH!\\" pump energy into you before the song kicks in. It's one of the most straight up rockin' songs on the album. <br />Love And Affection -- Although it's still a prime and great quality song, it's probably also the least popular. The structure is great but its not the most catchy tune. But, it is only fitting as the best choice for which song to close the great CD. <br /> <br />Overall, this is the CD I find myself listening to 50% of the time I even listen to music in general, it's that good. This is a great album to buy no matter what your musical interest is. It is very listenable, catchy and fun. I love this album. Unfortunately however, the album was so successful, Def Leppard's popularity skyrocketed high above anything it ever was before. Resulting, the band was on the road non-stop promoting the fantastic album. The hard life on the road led co-founder and guitarist Steve Clark to reach for the bottle of alcohol more often thanhe already was, hurting his dangerous struggle with alcohol. Tragically, Steve Clark would die from a deadly combination of drinking and taking perscription drugs in a hotel room in 1991.
0451526279|3.0|Genteel society in early 19th century England proved resourceful in conjuring up their own rural entertainment.  Dinner parties, amateur musicales, cards, charades and balls provided indoor amusement, while picnics, local excursions or taking the waters in fancy resorts took the restless upper crust out of doors. Lacking telephones and even telegrams Austen's characters relied on local mail delivery by their servants or trusted in the efficiency of the British Post to bring detailed, epistolary news into their information-starved lives. <br /> <br />  While the men discussed politics and their farming interests, most ladies devoted great mental and verbal energy to schemes for romance-encouraging or quashing. The fair sex plotted and surmised about their neighbors and relatives'affections for one another.  In true Victorian style pregnancy was hushed over, but village gossips took great delight in pondering such weighty matters as one's birth, social station and probable inheritance. <br />In addition the whims of older relatives must be humored at all cost, since they held the of purse strings which could make or break the success of a young person's suit.  Marriage after all was still more in the interest of the parents than for the sake of actual love. <br /> <br />  Twenty-one-year old Emma Woodhouse is the younger daughter and mistress of the home of her elderly father.  Having recently lost her young governess/companion to marriage, Emma undertakes a new social challenge: to mentor in her turn 17-year-old Harriet-a recent graduate of a local boarding school.  The plot revolves around Emma`s subtle attempt to mold Harriet's immature heart in certain directions, indicated by insincere behavior on the part of various young men.  Having frustrated what she considers an inferior proposal on Harriet's behalf, Emma gradually learns that she has meddled too much and caused needless unhappiness.   <br /> <br />   Several young couples court and become engaged in thecourse of this light novel, but all is not as it seems on the surface, due to a secret engagement and surprising twists of Cupid's darts.  Harriet's heart is easily swayed by suggestions and appearances--without direct, verbal confirmation--so it is Emma who matures the most.  She has long been sensitive of the good opinion of her 31-year-old neighbor, Mr. Knightly, who on two occasions finds it necessary to reprove her thoughtless behavior.  What does she care, since she has already declared that will never marry-which would mean deserting her doting but  <br />doddering father. <br /> <br />  This novel is Austen-lite, though in extensive format (over 400 pages), with many long letters which fill in the off stage action--which proves to be wherever our Emma is Not present.  The heroine's own tender heart is swayed first by this man, then by another. The advent of young persons into the village of Highbury is welcomed by local society-ever appreciative of newcomers to the social mix.  Inside these pages one encounters the typical village gossips and snobs of course, who make everyone's business their private agenda.  Ah, how will these impetuous young persons sort out their feelings and <br />relationships?  Especially without antagonizing or distressing their elders?  EMMA is almost a sly treatise on early Victorian social and moral restrictions, delightfully disguised as a novel. <br />
6302759110|3.0|I thought this movie was full of suspense, knowledge, and romance, and a good movie to watch to pass the time or if you haven't read the actual book.  However, I know for a fact that this movie's not historically accurate, and has many inconsistencies, like Dracula's real wife's name was Lydia, not Elizabeta, and he didn't really rule Transylvania, for the most part.  How do I know this?  Well, let me tell you briefly about myself.  I'm a foreign woman(my family's from India, if you must know), but my boyfriend is of Romanian descent, and he has actually taken me to Romania to learn about his people, his language, and his culture, and thus, I can tell you from all this that this movie is not in the least bit synonymous with the real Dracula book.  As a matter of fact, when my boyfriend and I watched it together, he laughed his head off, saying that if Hollywood thinks it can fool ordinary westerners by calling this movie \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", he knows for sure that it can't fool the Romanians, for they know the real story behind the story.  Please read the book before watching the movie, for it's a pretty okay film, but not that good or accurate. <br /> <br />PS:  Romanian men are wonderful with women.  God bless them!:)
B0002IQJUK|4.0|This year has been a good year for new, young artists and Gavin Degraw is no exception. Little bit Pop, heavy dose of Blues (and R&B), and a shade of Rock give him a great sound. He sounds strangely like \\"Stevie Wonder\\" on some tracks, but given how great of a musician Stevie is, that's certainly not a bad thing. The track \\"Chemical Party\\" is a little bit out there, but it's not horrible (growing on me, slightly).  <br /> <br />I'm by no means a musical officianado, but I know what I like... and I like Gavin. <br /> <br />Other artists/groups I enjoy (rather eclectic):   <br />- Keane (NEW for me),  <br />- Jamie Cullum (NEW for me),  <br />- David Gray,  <br />- John Mayer,  <br />- Dave Matthews Band, <br />- Linkin Park,  <br />- 3 Doors Down (most recent CD), <br />- Train, <br />- Coldplay, <br />- Dido <br />- Norah Jones <br />- Seal <br />- Sting <br /> <br />Hope that helps. Give Gavin a shot!  :-)
B0002EXH40|5.0|AMAZING.  This is one of my favorite Megadeth albums. Its so dark, and you can feel Daves emotion thoughout the entire record. Its so much more mature than any other Megadeth album yet. Dave just flat out killd on this album, not all the time with guitar shredding, but with lyrics.  Daves vocals on this album are surely some of the best he will ever record.  What a unique voice at that.  No filler here.  Just a great emotional(not \\"emo\\")metal album filled with rage that is evident in the lyrics.  No other Megadeth album like it.
B00006879E|5.0|RUN AND BUY IT! You'll definitely love it! If you buy this album because of \\"This Love\\", or \\"Harder To Breathe\\", you will love each song. Their music is totally cool and the songs are great.<br /><br />1. Harder To Breathe: 5/5 - It's a cool song, with a great chorus, but I don't like the beggining, but everything else is great.<br />2. This Love: 5/5 - Great; just great<br />3. Shiver: 4/5 - I like this song, generally; but there's kind of a scream in the chorus which makes me don't wanna listen to it too many times.<br />4. She Will Be Loved: 5/5 - A deep song; it's kind of slow, but it's definitely not bad. It's great.<br />5. Tangled: 5/5 - One of my favorite songs in the album; it's great, the lyrics are great, the music and everything.<br />6. The Sun: 5/5 - This is my favorite song in the album, when I feel bad, I hear to this song and it's like a song which makes you keep listening to the rest of the song, and stand up and sing with the radio.<br />7. Must Get Out: 5/5 - The beginning of this song isn't too good, but the verses and the chorus are great.<br />8. Sunday Morning: 5/5 - Awesome! It's not too fast, but it's not too slow: it's perfect<br />9. Secret: 3/5 - At least, for me this is kind of one of the worse songs in the album; it's too long and too slow<br />10. Through With You: 4/5 - It's a good song, good to relax, but it may have been a little faster in the chorus<br />11. Not Coming Home: 5/5 - It's totally cool, with great sounds, lyrics and everything; but it could have been also included as a studio version (the version included in the album is live)<br />12. Sweetest Goodbye: 4/5 - It's the perfect song to finish the album; starting with cool rock, finishing with a soft melody. But the chorus is the bad part in the song; if they would have changed it, this track would have been 5/5.<br /><br />AVERAGE: 5/5: I already told you why, so if you but it, you will definitely not be dissapointed.

B000060P79|1.0|This may be in my opinion the worst piece of crap band I have ever heard in my life. They're so terrible they may me want to puke or blow my head off to stop that terrible noise. Worst than boy bands, even worst than cancer, this is the most horrible music I have ever heard.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|It's very rare to come across a sequel that's even better than the first. X-2 is one of those rareties. The effects were bigger and better, we got even more into the characters, and we even get a little taste of the possible next movie. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that Cyclops, supposedly the Field commander of the X-men, has been once again neglected. I would have liked it a bit more if Cyke wasn't shoved into the ether for most of the movie. <br /> <br />Still, a must-have for any comics fan.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is the third greatest album to ever be released in the history of rock and roll.(Next to Ok Computer and The White Album.)If I ever stop liking Radiohead it may be because I have gone retarted or I've developed a serious illness.
B000002GXX|4.0|When I first heard \\"One of These Nights\\", especially the title track, I wasn't exactly blown away. Hey, it was 1975 - Disco was barging in, Gram Parsons was long dead, and Country Rock was going out of fashion. The Eagles were keepin' the flame burning, and in comes Don Henley like a bulldozer pushing disco with a searing, screeching lead guitar courtesy of Don Felder. No wonder why Bernie Leadon chose to leave right after this album was recorded, and why Randy Meisner would be on the outs pretty soon thereafter.    Country Rock was all but dead and gone, helped along its way by \\"Mr. Soul\\" Henley.    But in retrospect, while \\"One\\" wasn't as great an album as \\"Desperado\\" or didn't have the raw spark of \\"On the Border\\", for me; many years later this reviewer has some more respect and more appreciation. It has turned out to be the last of the great Eagles albums.    Forget the loud disco nonsense of that title song.     Glenn Frey scores high on \\"Lyin' Eyes\\" and \\"After the Thrill is Gone\\" (co-sung with Henley). Frey, in this reviewer's HO (humble opinion) was and remains the best singer in the Eagles, especially on the Country Rock tunes -and this was their last (partially-flavored) Country Rock album. There's Randy Meisner's beautiful voice on the classic \\"Take It to the Limit\\" and the sound of \\"Too Many Hands\\" harkens back to the previous several albums.    While Bernie Leadon seemed dejected in the change of sound and the changed attitude of Mrssrs. Frey and Henley (his face was in the background of the group photo; a harbinger of his soon departure from the band), his instrumental prowess was still the vital component of the mid-seventies Eagles' sound.     That Country lead guitar on \\"Lyin' Eyes\\"; the banjo-driven \\"Journey of the Sorcerer\\", and the sweet steel of \\"Hollywood Waltz\\" - these were all Leadon's contributions to this album, and his final ones to this band cannot be denied. While \\"I Wish You Peace\\" might not have been a good fit to the more rocking, moredisco'ed new Henley dominated Eagles, it is still a pretty song, featuring Leadon's clearwater vocals, and hey, the guy was in love with a beautiful woman who had co-written this song.    Henley? He bores this reviewer. Too pretentious.    Don has some highlights though and they include a poignant very Country vocal on \\"Hollywood Waltz\\" a song that aptly described the Southern California of 1975, and also where the Eagles were heading. It wasn't a pretty place. His duo voice with Frey on \\"After the Thrill is Gone\\" is good - but again, Frey was and is a better vocalist despite his own dependencies on Don to do the voice on the majority of Eagles songs. After all, look at all of the hits Frey sung lead on - \\"Take It Easy\\", \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\", \\"Tequila Sunrise\\", \\"Already Gone\\", \\"James Dean\\", \\"Lyn Eyes\\", \\"After the Thrill is Gone\\", \\"New Kid in Town\\" and \\"Heartache Tonight\\" - all much better and more superior to Henley \\"angst in my pants\\" or sensitive as s____ compositions!    Frey's vocals were still in excellent form then, Meisner brought \\"Take It to the Limit\\" and that distinctive high harmony to the table, and Leadon's instrumental prowess made sure that on \\"One of These Nights\\" the Eagles would see one more Southern California Country Rock day. That is, until Henley's disco and soul inclinations, the heavy pharmecutical usage, and the stadium rock insanity of Joe Walsh ruined it for all.     The Eagles lost out when Henley and Frey decided to jettison Bernie and Randy, but then again, we all did.    Really a three-star album, but saved by a beautiful song like \\"Hollywood Waltz\\" and by the voices of Glenn Frey and Randy Meisner - and the Country Rock lead guitar, banjo and steel performances of Bernie Leadon.
B00001NFCY|1.0|Creed were horrible. Let us rejoice in the fact that they had mental breakdowns and broke up.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Although almost every album has its critics, especially the X-Factor and Virtual 11, I really loved all their albums. Dance Of Death, their 13th release, is a bit of a disappointment. Although I did not expect Iron Maiden to reinvent themselves, I think that for the first time an Iron Maiden just did not grab me. Especially the solos are uninspired and the numerous harmonies after the solos are not as original as they were in the past. Even the vocals of Dickinson are disappointing compared to Brave New World. The sound quality is also a letdown. There are some good songs on the album such as the epic \\"Paschendale\\", \\"Montsigur\\" and \\"Age Of Innocence\\". And although these songs are good I would not use them for a best of. The worst song on the album is \\"Journeyman\\", the song contains an awful chorus. I think that that is one of the worst songs Iron Maiden has ever written. To Conclude: The worst album of Iron Maiden, but compared to Metal albums in general an average release.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Finally Star Wars is on DVD!  I was so excited to pick my copy up and while, like any geek I hate the changes, the overall viewing experience is so good that I'm happy to own this set. <br /> <br />I'm sure you've heard of the changes that Lucas has been making to these films since the SE release in 97 and he's done more in this DVD set.   However he's also cleaned up the movies so well that they look and sound absolutely incredible.  The supplemental DVD is full of so much interesting information about Star Wars that it was worth the purchase just to get it!   <br /> <br />My biggest problem is that the way the viewer experiences the movies has changed because of the prequels.  When Darth Vader revealed that he was Luke's father, it was monumental!  However for a new generation that starts with Episode I, it will not be be as it once was.  They will already know who Luke's father is and it will completely ruin such an amazing scene.   <br /> <br />Another problem is Greedo shooting first (I know I know) but it really was a big part of who Han Solo became.  In A New Hope he was a pirate, a scoundrel, who by Return of The Jedi was a good person who cared about others.  Him shooting Greedo first showed that he didn't care for anyone except himself and that he was cavalier in his attitude about life.  Removing this pivotal moment really dilutes the way he evolved into a better person. <br /> <br />Otherwise a great set and I'm glad we didn't have to wait until after Episode III to enjoy it. <br />
B00000K413|4.0|Despite their attempt to move away from this style of music, The Hurting really is TFF's most intriguing album, and in my opinion their best. The stark bleakness of this entire project is what drew their core audience to them in the first place. And since this album, they and their audience have \\"matured\\". But this album touched a nerve with certain people; people who hear their feelings being spoken about in these memories-evoking compositions. <br /> <br />The original album cover features Roland & Kurt in full black Goth-type attire staring into the blank distance near a tranquil duck pond.  <br /> <br />And then you listen to the music: sparse but melodic.  <br /> <br />Then you hear the lyrics: deep and troubling.  <br /> <br />Even if you never heard of these songs, you only need to read the song titles and you can tell right away that this is not about sunshine and lollipops. This is not about let's party, have sex, and rock n' roll. <br /> <br />This is about individuals who are dealing with disturbing issues, inner conflicts, and uncertainty. <br /> <br />Mad World, Start of the Breakdown, Watch Me Bleed, The Hurting...people have been living these lyrics forever.  <br /> <br />TFF, Roland & Curt, these songs, they understand \\"us\\". <br /> <br />
B0001I561E|5.0|This is Disney at it's best.  The animation is fluid and bright, the voice talent is top notch, the music is amazing and the script is incredible!  This was made during Disney's second Golden Age and along with the other movies of the 90's it helped Disney grow into a huge global entertainment powerhouse.  It's kind of sad that they haven't put out anything as good as this lately, but I have hope that one day they will. <br /> <br />Robin Williams steals the movie as The Genie.  He is my all time favorite Disney character and he is in top form here.  The rest of the cast is great, especially Gilbert Gottfried as Iago.  The soundtrack is full of some catchy and upbeat music that I bought the CD and wore it out and then bought another! <br /> <br />Some of the Arab characters do seem a little bit stereotyped, but nothing too offensive. <br /> <br />Also I'm sure the DVD packaging will be great.  Disney has really improved at packaging their DVD's and including interesting and worthwhile \\"extras.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, almost everyone will enjoy this movie and I cannot wait to add it to my collection. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000059MEK|5.0|Daft Punk may take a little getting used to for some people.  The only true and sure way to describe their music is weird. But discovering what makes them and their music 'weird' has been on of the greatest joys of my life and could be for you to.  One More Time is the most reconizable single and it's an ok song but it in combination with the first four songs (One More Time, Aerodynamic, Digital Love and Harder Better..) is what will either get you hooked to these guys or leave you saying 'What the !@$%'.  From dance floor melodies (One More Time, Harder Better) to amazing chill-out (Something About Us, Verdis Quo) to the just plain cooky (Superheros) this disc has it all.  But nothing ever sounds bad or out of place, it all flows together very musically and by the end of the album you should have at least one track that should infiltrate your all-time top 10 (btw, mine was Verdis Quo).
B00005JMJG|5.0|With all the junk Hollywood churns out nowadays you always know that anything from Charlie Kaufman will be a thought provoking and refreshing experience.   <br /> <br />**SLIGHT SPOILERS** <br /> <br />This movie is about what would happen if you could erase the memories you had of whatever worried or depressed you.  It's an interesting premise and one that many would jump at the chance to do.  I, however, would not want to have the procedure done because I feel your past experiences are what make you a stronger person. <br /> <br />Joel (Jim Carrey) meets and falls in love with Clementine (Kate Winslet) and it's an incredible relationship.  I found myself noticing things that only people truly in love do.  But, it does go sour and things end badly.  One person chooses to have their memories erased of the other and the other person chooses to do it as well (out of spite?) but regrets it during the procedure.  I won't get that far into the plot, because I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but the ending is well worthwhile and meaningful.   <br /> <br />Another great part of the DVD are the deleted scenes.  I was really moved by one in particular and I felt it should have been included... <br /> <br />Supporting cast is great, especially Kirsten Dunst.  She's so emotionally needy in the film and she plays it very well.  Elijah Wood is good in a mostly negative and backhanded role.  It's good to finally see him play something other than a Hobbit. As for Mark Ruffalo, he's a great actor but I wasn't really impressed by him in this flick. <br /> <br />I can't wait to see what Oscars this gets nominated for.  Be on the lookout for Jim Carrey to receive a best actor nod.  This is probably his best dramatic work yet! <br />
B000002VCQ|5.0|In 1985,22-year-old Whitney Elizabeth Houston released her self-titled debut album,and in no time,it sold by the dozens day by day. She forfeited the opportunity of portraying Sabrina LeBeauf's character,Sondra Huxtable on NBC's The Cosby Show in favor of her singing career. Hits from this best-seller include SAVING ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU,HOW WILL I KNOW,ALL AT ONCE and YOU GIVE GOOD LOVE. She sings a duet with Jermaine Jackson entitled NOBODY LOVES ME LIKE YOU DO,previously recorded by Dave Loggins and Anne Murray. I guess this was a reciprocation from when Whitney sang a duet with Jackson on his 1984 self-titled album. Other female artists to have a smash debut album include Carole King(TAPESTRY,1971),Alanis Morrissette(JAGGED LITTLE PILL,1995),Mariah Carey(her 1990 self-titled) and Sheryl Crow(TUESDAY NIGHT MUSIC CLUB,1993). Whitney took home a handful of Grammys for this album. Her second album WHITNEY,released in 1987,sold like hotcakes also.
B0002G2B2M|2.0|(...) <br />I'm so sick of people telling me about how great this film is.   Everybody in this film sucked big time. Hollywood jerks acting. I hate actors acting. Especially Hollywood actors acting. I was hoping this would be something that would really make me change my mind about the actors in this film. It only confirmed my views on them.     <br />Halfway trough this film I figured out what would happen in the end (I swear I never read the book).  I was hoping I would be wrong so my time wasn't wasted. Sadly I wasn't wrong. The second half of this film was filler leading up to the obvious ending. <br />This movie sucked. A great story ruined by Hollywood actors.
B000002JAX|4.0|Long before there was Norah Jones, Madeleine Peyroux stumbled off the streets of Paris into the hearts, minds, and souls of music afficianados worldwide with \\"Dreamland.\\"<br /><br />I owe it to a surprisingly \\"musically taste-inclined\\" office mate of mine for turning me on to Peyroux.  \\"Walkin after Midnight,\\" is one of the CD's few missteps.  With the rest of Peyroux's boozy Billie Holliday-esque its lightness just doesn't fit.  It gives you \\"one of these things is not like the other,\\" moments.  But the rest is simply golden.<br /><br />You will find yourself doing a double take on Peyroux's album pictures since her voice is way beyond her age.  It is the sound of aged hard earned wisdom and smokey resonance.  Peyroux was a 22-year old when she made this album.  \\"La Vie en Rose,\\" is a wonderful take on Edith Piaf and all that is lacking is the scratchy sound of a needle passing over ridges of vinyl.  Peyroux is infinitely listenable.  Her music is of the mood sweeping timeless.  You wonder if she has her own voice or if the whole act isn't a send-up of Holliday imitation, but as you explore the liner notes there are some beautiful Peyroux penned acoustic blues numbers that will turn you into a believer.  Even if it does sound too much like Billie Holliday...that's not a bad thing.  You will find yourself not caring and just caught up in the music.<br /><br />Enjoy audiophiles.<br />--MMW
068987474X|5.0|I found this book very humorous and uplifting.  The author offers advice that is not easy to hear.  However, it definitely rings true.  I totally enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any woman.
B000092ZYX|5.0|All hail Radiohead.  It took me a long time and a work like \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" to come to that type statement.  But what Radiohead has accomplished on this album earns them the critics darlings praise they have received all along.  Their otherworldly ambient rock reaches a new level here.<br /><br />Let me give you some background.  If you read any of my other reviews on Radiohead you will find me attempting to write them off as overstated hype but recently I've been going back to \\"OK Computer,\\" and \\"Amnesiac,\\" and find myself drawn into the sound.  I had always been willing to admit to Radiohead's sparks of originality but they seem to have drawn upon a chord of dislocation.  So, though I had all but written the group off and let the critics have their way with hailing the group as rock's genius wonders to take music to the next level, for some reason I kept buying their albums and thinking...maybe if I listen hard I'll find it too.  Well, \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" has me convinced of Radiohead's ascendency and let me tell you why.<br /><br />Though much has been said of the band returning to some rock roots with this album, on the whole I don't find that the case.  They have blended some more traditional (at least as traditional as Radiohead gets) rock with their electronica experimented sound they explored on Amnesiac and Kid A.  On the whole, there is plenty of spacey noises to go around and the beauty of it is...it doesn't come off forced or un-musical as much electronica can.  Instead it places Radiohead's soundscape deliciously detached, sublimely surreal.  \\"We don't wanna wake the monster / Tiptoe round tie him down / We don't want the loonies taking over,\\" sings Thomas Yorke on \\"Go to Sleep.\\"  And so it becomes a soundtrack to modern life in which we found ourselves deeply human swimming for air in a sea of unhumanizing technology.  There is that fear of waking the monster that is always just at the edge of Radiohead's songs.<br /><br />One thing that must be understood about \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" is that it's not feel good music.  It's not a total downer either.  It has more of the tension and stress of a Bowie's Ziggy Stardust or Outside or Trent Reznor mixed with some finely skilled songcraft.  It is music in a daze.  It is London fog thick and isolating.  It can be a perfect reflection of the modern condition.<br /><br />Each song seems to have it's place and uniqueness.  Some are split personalities between the drawn out high lonely croon of Yorke's falsetto and the driven beat.  They are down right schizophrenic which of course makes them so interesting.  \\"2+2=5,\\" is the opening track and sets the tone for the rest of the album.  A slight ticking keeps a nervous beat easing the listener into the eventual fury of, \\"It is too late now because you have not been paying attention.\\"  And then \\"Sit Down. Stand Up,\\" weaves its way into a techno throb repeating raindrops, raindrops.  \\"Backdrifts,\\" is a standout dance club beat that eventually devolves into those space gun laser shooting sounds.  Somehow it works.  The album all comes together on \\"Where I End and You Begin,\\" with a rolling bass driving the song along in classic Radiohead fashion.  You will think the Beatles have modernized themselves with a lick from Taxman on \\"There There.\\"  That leads into the 1-2 punch with \\"A punchup at a Wedding,\\" with a meandering guitar and piano duet that can leave you Saturday strip windows down rolling in the night 10 mph feeling the cool wash over you finger tapping on the side view mirror.<br /><br />Radiohead has truly done it with \\"Hail to the Thief.\\"  Any of you other doubting Thomas that still exist don't be an indie poser any longer...leap into the bandwagon baby.  This is the face of modern music.  Thomas Yorke and crew have elevated themselves so far above the fray that the masses will be aghast at trying to figure out what the beautiful noise all means.  Start scratching your head and tapping your toes.  Join in my dear dislocated listener.<br /><br />--MMWmy dear dislocated listener. <br />--MMW
6304696566|5.0|It is difficult to write succinctly about a film as complex and multifaceted as John Ford's THE SEARCHERS, but there can be no doubt that it is simultaneously one of the most extraordinary and one of the most unique and unusual Westerns ever made.  Contrary to what some of the reviewers have said, THE SEARCHERS it not a masterpiece of the conventional Western; it is, in fact, one of the most unconventional of Westerns.  In many ways, it is bolder and more subversive of its genre than any of the films of Sergio Leone or Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN.  The center of the film and its uniqueness is unquestionably John Wayne's titanic performance as the wrathful, haunted avenger Ethan Edwards.  Wayne, who is often - wrongly - accused of embodying the Western cliche of the upstanding yet tough-minded hero, here portrays a character as obsessively, even psychopathically, conflicted and driven as any modern protagonist (indeed, Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader have admitted that Edwards was among the inspirations for Travis Bickle in TAXI DRIVER).  It is, quite simply, one of the greatest film performances of the last century.  And, moreover, a performance which could only have been given in cinematic terms.  Most of Wayne's performance is in silence, in Ford's unrelenting closeups where, for a few brief moments, the rampaging emotions which are ripping Ethan Edwards to shreds become visible in his eyes and the lines on his weather-beaten face.  It is a masterfully etched portrait of astounding subtlety; there is perhaps no greater testament to its power than that of the greatest of all cinematic cynics, Jean-Luc Godard, who has claimed that he weeps every time he watches the film's final scenes. <br /> <br />While Wayne is the center of this film, it incontrovertibly belongs to its director; and Ford does not shrink from attacking the borders of his favored genre any more than his leading man does.  Again, contrary to what many critics have claimed, this film is neither dated nor in need of revision in its treatment of its Indian characters.  The Comanche cheif Scar is portrayed as both equal and counterpart to Ethan Edwards, as a man also driven by revenge, in this case, the murder of his son by whites.  While they are the object of Edwards's vengeance, Indians are also portrayed as being wantonly killed and mistreated by the cavalry.  The whites and the Indians are portrayed as two peoples locked in a dance of violence, but neither is given the moral upper hand.  As John Milius once remarked, the Comanches in this film are not savages, but kings.  It is true that THE SEARCHERS is not a politically correct film in any sense, but it is far more nuanced and complex than many would like to give it credit for.  Also understandable is the dislike some may feel for a character as flawed as Ethan Edwards, who is, after all, a bully, a racist, and, it is implied, a bit of an outlaw as well.  In my view, the question is a silly one.  To reject a film on the basis of its protagonists moral unsuitability would disqualify most of the films of Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, and most other directors of the modern era.  It is hugely unfortunate that Ford's reputation has suffered because he worked in a certain time period and in a certain genre which have now fallen out of favor with the cultural arbiters of the moment.  This dissonance only leads to the unfortunate demand that films like THE SEARCHERS conform to one's demands, rather than accepting the rewards that come from taking them fully on their own terms. <br /> <br />Most of all, in judging the film, it is important to remember that it is a tragedy, and not a simple morality play.  Ford shows all his characters as trapped and driven by their fates, not as manifestations of a cosmic good or evil.  In this sense, THE SEARCHERS is not a masterwork of conventionality, but the first modern Western.  It pushes the genre to its peak of moral and cinematic complexity, and it is a height which,I think it is safe to say, has not been reached again.
B0000025ZK|4.0|It's too bad that this was overlooked by the general public that stopped listening to Pink Floyd after \\"The Wall\\". Anyone who likes \\"Momentary Lapse\\" and \\"Division Bell\\" will love this one, which has classic Floyd moments like \\"Murder\\" and \\"All Lovers are Deranged\\", yet has horns on some of the tracks \\"Blue Light\\", and, egads, a love song \\"Love On The Air\\".  <br /> <br />It's  one where he's in transition trying to find his own way as a solo artist, and is not a \\"traditional\\" PF album by any means, it has some pop sensabilities.... But I think that it has a lot of great moments for fans to keep coming back to.  <br /> <br />Art of Noise's Anne Dudley, Jeff Porcaro, Steve Winwood, and \\"current\\" Who bassist Pino Palladino (Pete Townshend co-wrote 2 of the songs on here) make up the \\"surrogate band\\".
B00003CXCT|4.0|I don't have a big problem with Lucas modifying his films. After all, they are HIS films.BUT they don't look as good as they could, especially the space fighting scenes. As I'm watching Episode 4 everything looked good until the Millenium Falcon makes it's escape from the Death Star.When Han and Luke start ripping into the four imperial TIE-fighters you can still clearly see matte boxing around the fighters.I don't understand how the \\"boneheads\\" at ILM could have missed this. What, were they so \\"jonesing\\" for Starbucks that they just said \\"ah, screw it,we'll just release the \\"ultimate edition\\" in 2006, and all the Star Wars suckers (myself included) will shell out more bucks and buy it again. Shame on you Lucasfilm bastards for screwing the fans. Also, our friends (the matte boxes) pop up again in The Empire Strikes Back. Check the edges of the asteroids and you will see what I mean. It looks like they half-ass tried to erase them, but they are still visible.I truly just don't get it. Why clean up 98% of the film and not the whole damn thing. I haven't watched Return Of The Jedi yet, but I'm sure I can find this blatent neglect again. Overall, the films look pretty damn good, but these are not the be all, end all of this classic trilogy. Mark my words, there will be some kind of \\"Ultimate Edition\\" release after the theatrical release of Revenge Of The Sith, probably in time for Christmas 2005 or 2006. ILM is lame for this blatant oversight, and they are definitely not the best special effects house on the planet Earth any longer. John Gaeta and his crew (The Matrix trilogy) and WETA (Lord Of The Rings trilogy) have surpassed you guys. Any doubt? Then check out the grade B effects for Van Helsing and you'll see what I mean! I'm disgusted and out of here. Hey anybody out there see the matte boxes too? Let me know.Come on people I know you see the matte boxes-they are painfully obvious!
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|I was perusing the \\"Developing Artists\\" section of CDs the other day and happened upon a reasonably priced disc that intrigued me.  Instead of psychedelic jacket covers or trendy black and white band photos, the album was presented with the simple words Franz Ferdinand. <br /> <br />I immediately thought of that children's story where Ferdinand the bull is being trained for the bullfights but would rather sit in a field under a cork tree and smell flowers.  And there's something rather prophetic about that random association in my mind. <br /> <br />The boys of Franz Ferdinand have put together a compilation of sounds that comes across like a mix of the driving beat and themes of The Strokes and the cutting edge musical sensibilities of Modest Mouse. <br /> <br />They've got the thumping base line and distorted guitar riffs and Brit Rock vocals that could make them the next big thing in obscure popular music.  They sing like they mean it, as if improvising on the spot, but out of the simplicity, the beauty of contrived harmonies echoes.  They have the inexplicable ability to make your knee pop up and down and your hair nod like a bobble-head doll and your fingers start to wail on the air guitar you keep in your pocket and the piano keys on your lap. <br /> <br />Ferdinand is off to the bullfights. <br /> <br />But once they get there, there's a loss of complacency.  So instead of running strait for the red cape and goring you with a revolution of sound and violence, Franz Ferdinand retreats. <br /> <br />They retreat to a lack of lyrical depth and a lack of variety so they can sniff their flowers.  It's the kind of music you end up singing along with half-way through the first time you've heard the song.  It's natural, which is good, but it becomes the same after a while.  It's casual, it's familiar after you've gotten through the first half of the song.  And there's not a slow song on the album.  I'm not sure whether to applaud them for not feeling the need to giveus a break, or to chide them for their lack of musical variance. <br /> <br />And if you like that sort of thing, then Franz Ferdinand has an album for you.  But for me there seems to be a loss of faith at the end of the album.  I don't bore with it, it's more like I expect another song or three, to give me a feel for something different, something deep and penetrating.  But they'd rather sit in a field under their tree and sniff some flowers than gore you at the bullfights.
0743454529|5.0|This is the best novel I have read in some time.  By the end of the book I felt a connection with all of the characters and being a mother found myself questioning what I would have done in such a circumstance.  The ending was heart wrenching as are so many true life stories.  I highly recommend this book.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|You know that sound, like that band whose sound you could recognize anywhere?  Yeah, me too.  I love it.  Smashing Pumpkins, Cake, Radiohead.  Just downright unique. <br /> <br />Well, Indi Rock has been trying hard to make that happen for a few years now, and they're finally coming to their own.  There's a solid fan base (mostly college students and coffee grinders, sure, but we're not complaining), and a rising popularity. <br /> <br />A Saturday Night Live episode featured the band Jet, four leather shoe and boot-cut jean-toting guys with a couple of guitars and a little too much hair.  Now, you're expecting me to say, these boys are the epitome of Indie Rock and go buy their album before you lose your soul.  But I'm not. <br /> <br />That's the thing... Jet's not the kind of band I'm into: not exactly innovative.  Every song reminds me of something else I've heard: it's like Jack White (from the White Stripes) got together with the Strokes and cut an album covering a bunch of Rolling Stones and Beatles tunes.  You listen to them and come up with a better analogy, don't take my word for it. <br /> <br />But I keep popping the CD in my player.  There's something about them that I've been missing in my musical collection, like that Simon and Garfunkle Greatest Hits album I still haven't bought.  And that makes me wonder...  Is this where Rock is headed?  Amongst the kicking \\"Cold Hard B****\\" and hip \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" and the lyrical \\"Look What You've Done\\" and reflective \\"Timothy,\\" there's some fine guitar and playful vocals that somehow find the repeat button more often than I'd like to admit. <br /> <br />But don't expect a revolution: Jet won't preach and won't knock you back with a vulnerably new sound.  They will keep you listening, though, and searching for a few more bands out there who are finding their way out of Indi Rock and onto your radio without pushing you too far too fast.
B000025XKM|5.0|Thank God Nick Drake recorded music. Most people as emotive as he was stay mostly in the shadows. When he made this record he was frail, but made his point strong. I must say that anyone who believes themselves a \\"singer songwriter\\" should listen to this recording ,and  should consider if they can have anything to say thereafter sparing the rest of us the agony of boredom and tedium. Nick kept things vague and monolithic. He was a true artist in the romantic tradition.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Just finished watching all the disks and was amused by the previous posts.  Seems Amazon has become   a soapbox for Eurotrash.  That's okay.  At least they have free speech here.  I might remind some of  our Russian Comerads that if it wasn't for the mighty U.S. bringing Joe Steel, Nikita, Leonid and company's  house of cards down into a steaming pile, they would still be living in a third world superpower state.  Now they just live in a third world state, but have free speech.  Oh, I might add that we are waiting for the  billions you owe us in lend lease aid that you never paid back.  Maybe you should read the new editions  of those communist party history books you were brought up on. If it hadn't been for Uncle Sam's aid  both in material and in drawing most of the Luftwaffe back to western europe, you'd be employed washing   some Deutche technocrat's BMW, OR be a forgotten corpse in some mass grave.    For the mentally challenged who couldn't follow the story line...well I can only surmise you missed the little  school bus once too often and still possess the disabilities you were born with.    You might not agree with the depiction, but the events were based on true events and characters.  Sorry if our  soldiers weren't too fond of charging into massed MG34's, something Ivan appears to have been quite fond of  for the greater glory of the Motherland, Joe Steel and Gen Chechov.  I have news for our revisionist's in   the great USSR, er sorry I mean Russia, the empire formerly known as the USSR.  Huge casualty lists does not   a great struggle make nor admiration earn.  Your own communist commisars executed the equivelent of a full  US division...10,000 men, all to instill \\"patriotic\\" zeal in the troops. Could you blame them for wanting to go home to Ivana and a full bottle of vodka, rather than face the near certainty of death charging into the muzzle of an MG-42? So are we to have admiration for an army that had no regard for it's own men wasting them with little regard for questionable gains?    Let's remember what Joe Steel once said \\" The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.\\"  So, the Great Patriotic war was a statistic. Let's look at those statistics...    If it had not been for the invasion of Europe and the drawing away of some of the Wehrmachts finest divisions to  both Italy and France, the Soviet manpower well would have run dry earlier with devastating consequences.  The Soviet Army was tapped out after the battle of Berlin where over a million were wasted fighting for the honor of capturing a pile of smoldering bricks courtesy of the US Army Air Corp and the British Bomber Command  (PS we could have done the same thing to any city in the USSR at the time with impunity after a little forward basing into France or Germany).    The post-soviet revisionists need to read the declassified documents now available to learn the actual extent of their country's betrayal of thier own troops during the Great Patriotic War.    I read the book then threw it across the room and into the trash.  The movie is better.  The book comes off  as self promoting and congradulatory drek by a known plagarist.  Stephen Ambrose was apparently slipping in his   later years, His family book mill does not help his writing, I once assume it was a cadre of grad students ghost writing for him, now I learn that it his extended family, which would probably explain the plagiarism in  at least one of his more recent works.      What the movie leaves out is the often lengthy withdrawls the 101st had from the front between engagements.    Something the regular line divisions never had.  This was convienently glossed over in the movie.  It makes the combat fatigue lament in the book hard to swallow when many more endured the same for longer duration.  Sure these guys  were fearless, lucky and had balls as big as all out doors.  BUT, so did the lowly dogfaces in the regular line  divisions that stayed at the front for months on end.  Let's sing their praises too.  Just like the USMC, the Airborne seems to have grabbed more than their fair share of the glory and accolades due to press savy brass such as Ridgway, no slouch in the PR department.    The biggest criticism I have of the movie is the now cliche interviews, not with the participants, but the ACTORS!!  I mean they took the overblown actor's commeraderie lauded in the LOTR trilogy to new conceited heights!!  Who gives a great goddamn about the recounting of historical events by some actor playing army soldier who was born  35 years after the event, and probably slept through history class too boot?  They are obviously regurgitating  the material given to them to prep them for the roll.    Guys, stick to acting we don't care what you think, just scream and   drop dead on cue.
B000002GQH|2.0|When compared to 'In search of the lost chord' and 'To our children's childrens children, this release falls way short on both performances and sound quality. A few good songs but not enough to recommend it. Despite being remastered, the sound is not that much improved: very little high end and an overall 'thin sound'. 13 tracks/37.06.

I love children's books that I can read, being an adult, and not feel the writing is too childish.  Anybody can read this book and will fall in love with it!  Each character is so well described and interesting, even down to the ones with the smaller parts.  A must read!  Excellent!
068987474X|4.0|The title of this review says it all -- This is a simplistic easy (and fun) read, but that doesn't soften the impact of some blunt lessons about love and the opposite sex (although, I'm sure these ideas could apply to homosexual love as well).  Most of the ideas aren't new -- whether gleaned from other self-help books or observations made from our own experiences.  What's new is the full acknowledgement of such ideas as guiding themes to remember and actively implement.  He's not calling?  Stop hanging around the phone and get on with it, 'cuz he's not into ya.  He's calling but you're left feeling unappreciated, demeaned, whatever?  Same advice -- Get on with it 'cuz he's not into ya.  What's especially liberating is the notion that there is no need to pick over the whys and wherefores behind the man's inability to deliver what we would like.  All you need to know is that he's not into you -- as mistaken as you might think that to be.  And the authors assure you that he IS mistaken.  His loss.  And your chances of changing his mind are very, very slim.   <br /> <br />The hardest pill to swallow, perhaps even harder than the notion that there are people who won't dig you, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, is the notion that a specific passivity is called for.  We're advised not to pursue men, but to keep on pursuing whatever our hearts desire in other areas of our life -- Career, interests, passions, etc.  Just not... the men.  It's a tricky rationale of empowerment and docility and I think the authors of this book explain their stance pretty well although they don't offer how to come to grips with it.  That's left up to you.  Does this smack of The Rules?  Yeah, a bit -- and I really hate The Rules.  Where they differ is that The Rules tries to turn you into Uber-Fluffy-Female-Ideal (Grow your hair long, do your nails, be light and bubbly, etc, etc) whereas this book doesn't do any of that.  It says to get on with your life and BE YOURSELF, and other men will want to step upto the major leagues and match that.  You just have to be patient, and not settle.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000002MZ6|5.0|I can't quite explain this, but this music reminds you of the importance and deep comunication power that music can have. As with the great composers music, this reaches right in to the very soul, it's like the chords are in resonant frequency of existence itself! Outstanding!
6305882592|5.0|This movie addresses the fundamental questions of life.  It is direct; it is timely; it is wise. <br /> <br />What an incredibly simple key to what people have been searching for. <br /> <br />Bless you, Bud Cort, Ruth Gordon, Colin Higgins, et al. <br /> <br />I love you.  Thank you.
B0000BWVCL|5.0|there are still many many unused mutants from the x-men comic books.the bad guys led by magneto intend to get back at the x-men.1st magneto escapes by pulling all the iron out of his guards blood.he and a mutant hater attack the x-men mansion.that guys name is william stryker.his son was a mutant.they took a machine and forced him to control professer x to concentrate on all mutants to the point it would kill them.some new mutants show up like nightcrawler who teleports.banshee who screams and causes damage the sound.collossus who can form armor on himself.the ones that are in it a bit more reguraly are ice man and pyro.the kids can handle it.its the best comic book film.so,that would say that its therefore better than the first one.the same hot chicks are in this one as the last.they are jean grey and rogue.that blue chick,mystique,is completely naked.i saw it on fx.they say she was colored blue and the only thing she had on were sticky bumpy things.they didnt even cover up her nipples.but since they look like a nipple you cant tell.and belive me ive looked!there are a few minor inconsistencies from the book like collosus was an older member and wolverine didnt show until far later.also,ice man was an original member.there are a few absentees also,timeline wise.theres a subtle racist overtone.thats unfortunate since im so sick of being made out to be the bad guy because im white.the best part was when wolverine gets plugged right in the temple by a cop and then regenerates and stands up.it was cool!ive never seen any of these guys anywhere else.oh!i did see professer x on star trek.but they suck.everyone of them.the special effects are pretty damn cool too.the ones with pyro,iceman,nightcrawler and mystique are all outstanding!i could go on and on about all the other unused mutants but i did that in my x-men 1 review.check it out!youre being robbed of at least 4-5 awesome movies!my 5th favorite movie of all time!
B00005JNEI|5.0|I saw this at the theater twice and both times it was phenomenal. Everyone should see this film more than once. Michael Moore does not go easy on the Democrats either; he just tells what happened from the \\"election\\" of George W. to 9/11 and its aftermath. And it's a good thing he had the guts to do it, because so many people just have no idea what our government is doing for us, or, more likely, for themselves. This documentary is realistic, not perfect and polished, but I cannot emphasize strongly enough how honest, moving, thorough and powerful it is. Michael Moore is a hero, and a true, unafraid American. I highly recommend this film as a mandatory for anyone who has an interest in seeing the truth, and using it to better society as a whole.
B0000BWVBD|4.0|the movie strays way off the point.every true comic fan knows that the hulk was created when david banner had a bomb blow up near him.it wasnt the dna from a serum his dad put into himself.it made me feel bad when i saw stan lee on the dvd condoning that crap too.theres a lot of science in the movie and a few child abuse scenes.this prevented a 5 star rating.it all could have been avoided by just keeping with the story.none of the new comic movies do that.anyhow,little bruce,not david now,grows up and the genes hit him and he becomes the hulk when hes mad.then his ol ladys dad,who is a general tries to contain him so they can get a sample of his hulk skin and make super soldiers and millions in the process.he gets out and then theres this incredible fight between him and the army.the kids like the parts with the hulk but get bored during the long science scenes and scared when the abuse is going on.so,just buy the dvd and skip the crap.ang lee is your director.he also did crouching tiger hidden dragon.he says he wants to break down the old monster stereo type and go into a new age where instead of monster comes out goes crazy and is killed,theres a analyzation of just what makes the monster tick.there are a lot of 1st time special effects in this one like the hulk being a cgi and interacting with so many other things and many split screen point of view.its the best hulk movie to date and there is a lot of old tv  movies about the hulk.i think its fair to call this one emotional.the hulk is bubbling over with them.his girlfriend is dykey looking.can a cgi win an award?the hulk rocked in this one!the fights are outstanding!my favorite part is when a helicopter fires a rocket at him and the hulk catches it and then bites off the warhead and throws it into the chopper.that was cool!no one important is in this one.the special effects and ideas for battle scenes are excellent.i hope to see more hulk movies.its long and drawn out in spots but when its on,its really on.
B000002PH1|4.0|Oooh baby do you know what thats worth? <br />Belinda's second and most successful album is a wonderful piece  <br />of work!I firmly believe that Heaven Is A Place On Earth is one  <br />of the best songs ever made. Its one of those songs when played <br />in the right circumstances can seriously give you chills! On the <br />whole, the album is slightly on the 80s side (obviously since <br />it came out in 1987) with  songs like Fool For Love and Nobody <br />Owns Me,  they both have really good guitar work though.  <br />But it has a sort of heavenly feel to it.  <br />On a more negative note, I felt that We Can Change  <br />was stupid and corny (Come on Belinda!) <br />Miss Carlisle does occasionally linger dangerously over the line <br />between beautiful and cheesy. Thats the only critism I can give <br />her. Many people have said shes not a good singer, I disagree <br />she may not have the amazing voice but she sings with a great  <br />deal of passion and that makes her great. I'm a big fan of her <br />and although this album isn't her best (I believe that honour <br />belongs to Runaway Horses) it's still Belinda and I wouldn't ask <br />for anything more!  <br />And it's definitely worth getting! whether you love her or just  <br /> <br />want to add something to your cd collection!
6300271285|5.0|FLAWLESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!the story goes that a nerdy little geek lives in the slums.he works for a slave driving boss.his only co-employee is a really sexy abuse victim.they work at a flower shop that no onecomes to.one day,the nerd buys a strange and interesting plant which attracts customers like mad.then he discovers the tiny little flytrap style plant lives off of blood.each time it feedsit gets quite a bit bigger.the worst is yet to come!it gets so big,it matures and starts singing,dancing and talking the nerd into murdering to keep it alive.its a great movie.my 9th favorote ever.i even heard it was made into a broadway musical!theres a whole host of stars including,rick moranis as the nerd,john candy as a dj,bill murray as a lover of pain and many many more.theres a lot of cussing in it,so maybe you dont want your kids to watch it,but all the violence is implied or overheard.its a comedy but like one for sick puppies.frank oz is the director,whoever the hell that is.theres a older version from 1960 maybe with jack nicholson in it.this one is better.a few of its songs even made dr dementos top 20 most demented videos of all time back in the 80s when mtv was cool.they were one about steve martin,who plays,a dentist who likes to inflict horrible pain on his patients and rides a motorcycle to work.this is steve martins best character ever.another song that was on it was on the countdown was about that guys abuse victim ol lady who dreams of escaping.some other songs on the album[it is a musical] are the guy sure looks like plantfood to me,grow for me,you dont know who your messing with and more.the lyrics are really really catchy.the chicks name is audrie.she is sexy!the best performance,though there were many ,was by syeve martin for his psycho-nitris addicted-ol lady beating-biker-dentist-sado-maschoist.this is everybody ive mentioned best film ever.it is 1 ahead of jay and silent bob strikes back on my top 100 films ever.this one is #9.
0894808532|5.0|At their best, and for those American readers willing to attune themselves to it, British authors can produce a particular kind of laid-back, raised-eyebrow, highly literate humor that is a joy to read. Especially Terry Pratchett: As any wife of a fan of the Discworld novels knows, one experiences an unavoidable urge to quote out loud from his work at length. Neil Gaiman, on the other hand, is known not for humorous writing but for his rather dark Sandman comics -- and yet the two make an admirable team. Putting it briefly, the plot here is about Armageddon, the end of everything. Crowley (whose name used to be \\"Crawley,\\" back when his job was being the serpent in the Garden) is a general stirrer-upper based in London, especially by designing infernal highway systems. Aziraphale is an angel (unfallen) whose original job was to wave a flaming sword and chase Adam and Eve away from the Garden, but he's now a rare book dealer. Like competing undercover agents everywhere, the two long ago reached an understanding by which neither of them rocks the other's boat too vigorously and everybody gets along. Besides, both rather like the human race and neither wants to see a final end to the world. Things promise to get dicey, however, when the Antichrist is swapped out for a human newborn -- except that the satanic nun in charge of the operation (i.e., Sister Mary Loquacious) screws up and the wrong infant leaves the hospital designated as the son of Satan. The real changeling, whose name (of course) is Adam, grows up as an almost ordinary boy in the village of Lower Tadfield and is now eleven years old. Which also happens to have been the home, three hundred years ago, of Agnes Nutter, witch, and the author of the only absolutely accurate book of prophecy ever published. Who is the ancestor of Anathema Device, present-day psychic newly come to Tadfield to try to sort things out. Who gets involved with the somewhat pathetic but well-meaning Newton Pulsifer, a private in the two-man Witchfinder Army. There's also the Four Motorcyclists of the Apocalypse (Death speaks all in CAPITAL LETTERS -- obviously Pratchett's contribution), and the Hound of Hell, who becomes a small, scruffy mongrel at the insistence of his master and rather enjoys it. All in all, it's hard to imagine a more delightful, more whacked-out, more determinedly irreverent antidote to LaHaye's \\"Left Behind\\" series.o-man Witchfinder Army.

B00005ATQI|5.0|the only flaw in this one is a lot of people dont understand what the hell the shining is and what the hell is going on.well,in this movie it is included but its not really necessary to know.the story was written by stephen king who is widely called the best horror writer ever.it was directed by the greatest film maker ever,stanley kubrik.it starred the greatest actor ever,jack nicholson.how could you miss with a lineup like that?the story goes that ol jack and his kid who sees dead people and his flaky ol lady stay in a giant house all winter and cant leave due to snow.jacks a writer and so he thinks the quiet will be good.it sets him crazy.jack nicholson stars in it.if youve been in a coma since the 50s he was in such greats as easy rider,one flew over the cuckoos nest and hells angels.the kids will get freaked by this so put them to bed.this is a horror film if i havent made that abundantly clear already.theres this one part where hes chasing his wife up some steps and he says all cooly,\\"i dont wanna  hurt ya,i just wanna beat your brains out\\".it was classic!the director is the best one ever,stanley kubrik who made such classic films as,2001:a space oddysey,a clockwork orange,full metal jacket and eyes wide shut.whoever that chick is was on a stanley kubrik documentary.she wasnt trying hard enough and he bitched her out in front of everyone.he said something to the effect of\\"if your not going to try,what are you being paid for?youre wasting my time and everyone else in heres time too.all you have to do is drag this 6 year old around and look scared.whats so hard about that?\\"it was hilarious!its a classic!id say kubriks 3rd best film and the 12th best film ever made!the best horror film ever so therefore the best stephen king movie also.any true film lover will love this one.there are parts where thier boy suffers with his mental problems.this is a bit emotional.but you know stephen king,hes not happy unless some kids getting wasted or has some serious problem.hesa real sicko!someone should lock him up.i think there was only one movie released in the entire 70s that was better.his woman is very weird looking.shes also stupid and obnoxious.jack nicholson gave  his best performance ever here.although one flew over the cuckoos nest is neck and neck for his best acting.is it as good as the hype?no.ITS WAY BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!its a long one but worth every minute.
B0000065O1|2.0|No i did not like this tape. I was surprised that it really wasnt that challenging as her first tape had me dripping w/sweat. <br />there wasnt enough cardio and the arm work wasnt challenging at all.  The only good part was the ab section  that was actually a little hard for me.  But again, her first tape is alot better, better music, better routines, everything.
079213690X|5.0|this is my 4th favorite movie ever!its about a scottish revolutionary named william wallace.he and friends were peasents in ancient times.england tried to takeover scotland and he banded together all the nobodies to take the battle to england.they were commonly outnumbered at least 10 to 1,using only leather armor and wooden spears,and utilized brainy tactics to overthrow a far more powerful english army.mel gibson is in it in his greatest role ever.its a bit bloody for kids.there are many beautiful quotes from the movie such as\\"you dont choose your dreams,your dreams choose you\\"and \\"every man dies but not every man really lives\\".it is the best movie set in mid-evil times ever!its likeable by most anyone.theres blood and guts,romance,intensity,emotion,strategy,action and much much more!it is true.there are many very beautiful women here.mel gibson gave the performance of a lifetime as william wallace.his friend steven,an crazy irish guy who hears god like joan of arc,puts on a great show too.no words can describe how great this movie is!!!!!!!!!the final scene with william wallace is very grueling.theres many bloody battles.theres cauterization of wounds,dead people dying in thier families arms,its very emotional.the important mesage is that this guy belived in something hed rather die than live without his freedom.it is a very very long movie but never gets old for even a second.a classic!

B00005ATQE|5.0|this movie stars,in the first,part a psycho drill instructer who says things that would make a prisoner blush.he was a real life drill instructer for 8 years.some say 12.this was his first ever role and he more than convinced me.the basic storyline is that theres boot and then the boys go off to nam.i dont recall seeing anyone in this movie anywhere else.that is except the drill instructer who is on the tv show  mail call now.this is not for kids.i dont say this often but most teens will probably think this is a bit much.the directer stanley kubrik made this film so you know its a classic.my  6th favorite movie ever and second favorite kubrik film.theres the very sadistic drill insructer,a suicide,very intense war moments and much much more!i think a lot of people wont be able to handle this film.it requires a certain degree of maturity.theres a hooker who comes up and says\\"me so horny\\",you might remember that from the 2 live crew song.shes alright i guess.the drill insructer gave an awesome performance!there are many intense parts.hazing,extremely vulgar language,suicide,and an intense scene where thier buddy gets shot.he falls and the sniper continues to shoot the victim but non-lethaly.a guy would run out and get killed.the sniper reeled them out one by one like that.thier friends were helpless and had to watch thier friend be picked off piece by piece.that would totaly suck!its the best viet nam movie ever!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Max(Jamie Foxx) and Vincet (Tom Cruise) were great together in this film.  The film was a crime thriller which kept everyone on their toes.  Max a cab driver had to be a part of a crime venture throughout the city helping Vincent as a driver.  The movies is exciting and moved fast enough to keep your attention.  Both actors had chemistry together.

0790749815|5.0|Hitchcock liked working with Cary Grant and James Stewart. Any of his movies that have either of these stars were exceptional and could be viewed by the whole family. These movies always dealt more with suspense than showing blood and gore. North By Northwest is one of the most suspenseful of his movies and it has a good romance story to boot. Cary Grant is magnificent playing the innocent bystander caught up in a grand scheme of espionage.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint is wonderful as the romantic interest that is a unknown factor. Is she a spy for the bad guys or is she on the side of justice? This movie also contained some wonderful scenery and sets. The Biplane and Mt. Rushmore scenes have some of his greatest camera work ever. The angles used are extremely effective in making you feel you are there. Bernard Herrman's beautiful haunting music adds to the suspense and helps to make this movie a classic Hitchcock.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|An absolute waste of my time! <br /> <br />One of the worst movies I ever had to view in the cinema... <br />I felt so bad that for the first time in my life I almost walked out of the cinema.. I begged for it to end! <br /> <br />And for everyone ho is interested I am a huge fun of Beckinsdale and Hugh Jackman.. <br /> <br />The acting was silly, the monsters laughable and the cgi was the worst I've seen since Power Rangers the Movie! <br />I thought LOEG (the league of extr.... which I made the mistake of buying) was bad but then came Van $#%$#$#%$ and LOEG now seems like a decent film! <br /> <br />130 Million $ for this crap...
B000002O5L|5.0|Full Moon Fever, along with the later Into the Great Wide Open, are probably, and personally, Tom Petty`s best albums. They doesnt even break a sweat to accomplish it. The Melodies on Full Moon Fever, Written by Petty and my ever favorite Jeff Lynne, delivers to the max.  <br /> <br />Can ANYONE who have heard Free Falling tell me they didnt love that song? From the moment he pulls out that guitar and strikes the first few strings, the wonderful music never stops to grab the listener.  <br /> <br />The Best songs on this album are co-written with Lynne(The Mastermind behind ELO), and they are: <br /> <br />-Free Falling: Beautiful piece. Simple, yet so anthemic and good that it has become one of Petty`s most loved songs. <br />-I Wont Back Down: My Personal Favorite on this album. Upbeat and sweet, this song is about doing what you like and fighting for it, without giving up. One of Petty`s most catchy rockers ever with one of the worlds best Choruses, filled to the brim with a classic Petty&Lynne Sound.  <br />-A Face in the Crowd: A beautiful song again penned by Petty&Lynne. Almost Dreamlike, with Slide guitars and typical Lynne influences all over.  <br />-Yer So Bad: Love this song. So Catchy, with a funny lyric and a Killer Chorus. Once again, Petty&Lynne. <br />-The Apartment Song: Written by Petty Alone, this short but sweet little song has a catchy, accousticsounding style, and sounds refreshing and its just a pure fun song all around. <br />-Zombie Zoo: Incredible. The song is just so fun! Its supercatchy and the lyrics are totally hilarious, but the most important thing is that it just works. From the nearly horror influenced introriffs to the ELO throwbacks, it is a twister of fun. Penned by Petty&Lynne. <br /> <br />Those are the absolute highlights on this album imo. There arent a bad song here, and although the ones not mentioned are \\"weaker\\", they are not in any terms bad. Not quite my style of Petty, but still so good that they dont detract from a grand 5`er. <br /> <br />Petty and Lynne have continued to work together, and they recently appeared playing together. I`m still praying they will consider one more album together, as its pure magic.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I knew who I was voting for before I saw this movie and it reinforced everything I knew and believed. I am not very proud to live in a country led by a president who has killed thousands of innocent and at least a 1,000 plus of our own soldiers...if you are voting for Mr.Bush again this year (he should have never been president in the first place...what a shame) I STRONGLY urge you to see this movie and see why we need a new leader for this country- someone who knows what he is talking about and knows how to lead a country.

That said, this song and video made an impression on me.  <br /> <br />At face value, an American Patriot will scorn this song for the video alone (I almost did, ESPECIALLY because it was Green Day, as Punk as apple pie and California blondes, snooginz!).  But the point was avast in a sea of \\"Who Are We\\"!  American Idiot is not the name Green Day has coined for ALL Americans!  it is the name Green Day has coined for Media infested Americans!  Americans who live their lives through the news media and nothing more, for the Americans who experience their lives through 9-5 jobs and live in the subrubs and drive SUV's and have no life of their own, because they live throughthe MEDIA!  I think Green Day did it!  I think they might have found some real PUNK in their cereal box this year!
0679735259|5.0|Michael Herr's \\"Dispatches\\" is one of the finest personal memoirs from a reporter in the Vietnam War. His account is full of the machismo, swagger, cynicism and passion that are indicative of the war correspondent.  \\"Dispatches\\" is brutal and unflinching in its realism but the ugliness of the book - and the war - is leavened at times by a dark humor and sense of the surreal.  Herr has a great ear for dialogue and a gift for observation and he describes the dramatic events of the Tet Offensive and his experiences with soldiers in places like Khe Sanh in great detail.  This irony filled and drug fueled narrative is written in the tradition of Crane, Hemingway and Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" which became the inspiration for the film \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"  It should be read by anyone who seeks to soak up some of the atmosphere of the long, ugly war in Indochina and the men who sent their dispatches home for readers back home.

B000002P2V|3.0|Compared to the Who's best, this one is pretty low.  Compared to their contemporaries' best, it's pretty low.  But judged on its own, it's a pretty decent set of songs.  I owned the lp back in the 80s and hadn't listened to it in years.  Bought the disc about four years ago and thought it didn't stand up.  But listening to it just this past week I enjoyed it.  I especially like the lesser-known songs:  \\"Guitar and Pen\\", \\"Music Must Change\\", \\"Love is Coming Down\\".  And even after years of radio play, the title song still has lots of power and great playing.  I think Pete really shines on this album in subtle ways. <br /> <br />One disappointment:  several of the songs have slight changes from the original LP.  That is annoying.
0671799320|5.0|Although the western world's dependence on fossil fuels requires us to deal with some of the world's most odious regimes because of our massive needs, we will be importing massive amount of oil for the foreseeable future.  While there are alternative energy sources that show some promise, it will clearly take decades to develop them and the investment of many billions of dollars.  So, we are left drilling deep in the earth so that we can extract the \\"black gold\\" that our industrialized societies run on.  Unfortunately, some of the most massive oil reserves are located in the most politically volatile areas on earth and are controlled by autocratic regimes with populations that resent our presence and involvement in the region.  How did we end up where we are today?  This is the question that Daniel Yergen answers in his long, epic history of oil.  He is a gifted writer and beginning with early oil discoveries in America and the growth of Standard Oil, John D. Rockefeller's colossal corporation, he adroitly sketched the businessmen, bureaucrats and diplomats that forged the oil business.  He then artfully describes the discovery and race to develop the world's largest oil deposit in the Middle East, the vital importance of oil reserves to the warring powers during World War II, the emergence of OPEC and the current state of energy strategy.  Yergin has a deep background in the energy business as well as a firm grasp of the complex strategic issues that face is and \\"The Prize\\" is a sweeping panoramic history of one of the world's most important commodities.    Jeffrey Morseburg
B00005NI5Y|5.0|When I first bought this album, I wasn't TOO pleased with it, but after taking a break from it for a little while and listening to it again, I love it - I can't get enough of it now. I would have to say that my favorite tracks on the CD are Mississippi, High Water (for Charley Patton), Moonlight, Po' Boy, Cry A While, and Sugar Baby. This CD just keeps getting better every time I listen to it. If you're a fan of Dylan, this is a definite must-have album - one of his best. The lyrics, music, and just about everything about this album is amazing. You should definitely give this album a chance; it deserves your attention.

This is clealy a female gender book so as a guy I might be a bad judge, but it makes me think there are a lot of silly girls out there if crap is selling.

The only song I don't think she should include is the U2 cover of \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", this song does not work for Cher. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed the 'history' part of the show where Cher <br />dresses like she did in the 70's and performs her hits from then as part of a medley.  Cher still looks exactly the same as she did, so dressing up like that really works well.  I also loved it when the medley moved into her 1979 disco hit \\"take me Home\\".  Cher appeared in a carbaret outfit for this, simply stunning!  Then the song \\"The Way of Love\\" was performed, and Cher reappeared looking like she did in the mid 70's with very long straight black hair and an elegant slinky gown.  This performance alone, is worth the price of the DVD. <br /> <br />If all of this wasn't enough, Cher does more costume changes for the \\"If I could turn back time\\" song, and yes, she really pulls this off beautifully.   <br /> <br />Love her, or hate her, you cannot deny that Cher is one of the true survivors.  I have the utmost respect for an artist that continually reinvents themselves, but does not forget any of their past. <br /> <br />This concert is an absolute pleasure to watch.  I highly recommend it to see how a true performer puts on a show.  Well done Cher. I only wish the concert was longer.
0679745203|1.0|I find it incredibly funny that so many people are gushing over this book.  They must think they're supposed to like it because it won the Booker prize. *I* am ashamed of the fact that it's still on my shelf.  I think I'm going to use it for toilet paper.
0395389496|5.0|Not many children book can transcend its target audience. Luckily Chris Van Allsburg's \\"The Polar Express\\" can reach readers who are older than 8. But, however much this book is appealing to adults, it still may not find many readers among teens. But there is a reason for it: this is a story for those who still believe in Santa Claus, or for the ones who wish they could still believe. Teenagers are usually a way to cynical to identify with one of these definitions. Well, maybe when they get older.<br /><br />The narrative is very appropriated. From the choice of words to the story itself, it totally fits the universe of a small kid. The use of simple words, along with short sentences, makes it an easy read for those who are learning how to read. To make the task easier there is a great amount of descriptions and comparisons. They are abundant, but not redundant or boring.<br /><br />The narrative is enhanced by the amazing pictures -- but neither is repetitive, they complete each other. Despite all the illustration, the writer is smart enough to leave room for his reader's imagination. This work of filing in the gaps mentally is not privileged in many children's books that most of the time tells and shows everything -- therefore the young reader never have a imagination exercise, and become a lazy reader expecting to learn facts and figures from the narratives. However, this is not the case in \\"The Polar Express\\".<br /><br />This is a story of a little boy who is having second thoughts if Santa exists or not. He is invited to join a trip to the North Pole, where something magical will happen -- involving Santa Claus and a little bell.<br /><br />In the world of Van Allsburg, less is more. The illustrations are not heavy or with too many details. They are simple, but not simplistic. The lack of small details makes the reader focus on the main action of every picture. This is a smart move by the writer/illustrator.<br /><br />There is also contrast of images. During the travel to the North Pole, outside the train is cold and dangerous. While inside is very warm and cozy. My favorite illustration is the first one that shows the inside of the train with children and two men serving \\"hot cocoa as thick and rich as melted chocolate bars\\".<br /><br />It is not difficult to notice that the use of light in Van Allsburg's work reminds of Caravaggio. The beam of light is directed to the central action of the illustration. In the first time we see Santa Claus he is the only one receiving light, while his elves and surroundings are in the shadows. This shows the character's dimension, like his a God of his own world.<br /><br />This is a book highly recommended for children and nostalgic grown-ups. It is also the perfect Christmas gift for almost everyone.es. During the travel to the North Pole, outside the train is cold and dangerous. While inside is very warm and cozy.

B000068OSK|5.0|I don't normally care for \\"pop\\" bands but I had to see what all the fuss was about.  Well, it was a successful experiment as this is a great record.  I was most impressed with the recording, which does not sound like the usual overly-produced crap but rather much more real, raw, analog-ish and with natural ambience and that campy spring reverb sound from an amp-don't hear that very often, so that's cool.  I also like how they overdrive the vocals on some tracks, it actually works and doesn't come across as corny, like the phone EQ effect. (don't know if this is an overloaded mic pre or as another poster said, they were sent through a guitar cab) The guitar tones are great too - they sound like amp cabs, not the usual dry, direct-inject sound you usually hear.  I downloaded this one from iTunes originally, but let's face it - iTunes is half-arsed.  You don't own anything but a bunch of lousy computer files and have no liner notes which might reveal anything slightly interesting about the record.  Feh!  So I intend to buy the disc anyway. <br /> <br />I'm sure you could point to a dozen bands they may or may not sound like but I don't much care about all that. It's just fun, well-executed rock and blues with a proper recording which doesn't make everything sound fake like most pop.  That can only be a good thing.  I wonder if it is peak-limited though?  Hmmmm...
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|While it is indeed true that some of Ray Charles' vocal performances on this disc are mediocre at best I am willing to cut him a bit of slack.  After all, the man was 73 years old when he made these recordings.  For those of us 55 and under Ray Charles has been a force in popular music just about all of our lives.  When I heard that Ray Charles had died I felt much the same way I did when a major sports figure like Ted Williams or Mickey Mantle passed on.  All were an important part of my era and it saddens me when they leave the scene.<br /><br />But the good news is that on many of these tracks we can still hear the Ray Charles we all know and love.  Remakes of two of his hits \\"Here We Go Again\\" (with Norah Jones) and \\"You Don't Know Me\\" (with Diana Krall) are wonderful reminders of some of the great music Ray made in the 1960's.  I also enjoyed Ray and Natalie Cole in a funky rendition of Little Willie John's classic \\"Fever\\".  Unfortunately there are some clunkers here as well, most notably Ray's duet with Willie Nelson on the Frank Sinatra hit \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\".  Both men were downright awful on this one and it should have been left off the album entirely.  But fortunately the disc finishes with a flourish with the final four tracks.  Ray seemed to hit his stride alongside the legendary B.B. King on \\"Sinners Prayer\\".  Just hearing these two men perform so well at such an advanced age is worth the price of the disc alone.  Perhaps my favorite cut on this CD is \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" with one of my all-time favorites Gladys Knight.  You might think the song was recorded 25 years ago.  The final cut is a \\"live\\" performance with Van Morrison.  \\"Crazy Love\\" was a tune Morrison recorded on his very first solo LP back in 1970. Once again, a superb job by both men here.<br /><br />I was stunned when I learned that \\"Genius Loves Company\\" is currently #3 on the Billboard album chart.  But when you stop to think about it there really isn't much for older folks to buy anymore.  If you are looking for a great gift for that special boomer in your life then this would be the ticket.  You can be sure it will be appreciated.re looking for a great gift for that special boomer in your life then this would be the ticket.  You can be sure it will be appreciated.
B000002N2P|5.0|This is my favorite of Green Day's albums its better than Dookie, its better than Nimrod. Just great all around... here's a song by song review: <br /> <br />1. Armatage Shanks 9.5/10- Um... yeah... what does the title have to do with anything? Anyway this is a very good song, 5th best on album, I love the intro. <br /> <br />2. Brat 4/10- Well every album has some low points, even the best. <br /> <br />3. Stuck With Me 10/10- Very catchy song, 3rd best. <br /> <br />4. Geek Stink Breath 10/10- Now here is the 2nd best song on the album. Catchy beats, lyrics sung very well, just can't get enough of this one. <br /> <br />5. No Pride 8/10- Pretty good song, catchy just like most songs by Green Day, Billie Joe just knows how to write great music. <br /> <br />6. Bab's Uvula Who? 7/10- The beat is good but the singing isn't Billie Joe's finest. <br /> <br />7. 86 6/10- This song gets an eh. <br /> <br />8. Panic Song 7/10- Who'd have thought a 3:35 second song would feel long and drawn out, still a decent song if you can make it through the whole thing. <br /> <br />9. Stuart and the Ave. 9/10- This is a good song but definately would not be better than Stuck With Me and Jaded on International Superhits!, as one previous reviewer said. <br /> <br />10./11. Brain Stew/Jaded- 10/10- Monster hit, and deservedly so I've combined these two because you will always here them together. Both parts are very good. <br /> <br />12. Westbound Sign 7/10- Pretty good song but not the best. <br /> <br />13. Tight Wad Hill 5/10- Another Song that gets an eh <br /> <br />14. Walking Contradiction 11/10- Saving the best for last, apparently. Love the lyrics, love everything about this song music video is very funny. <br /> <br />Go buy this album if you like music! If you don't like music, then why are you reading this? Do yourself a favor and by this Great CD
0792843584|1.0|Much has been written about the critical and commercial fiasco of \\"Heaven's Gate\\" (1980). Director Michael Cimino's misguided epic not only contributed to the downfall of United Artists, but almost single-handedly destroyed the Western genre. (Luckily, Clint Eastwood helped save the day with \\"Pale Rider\\" and \\"Unforgiven.\\") Perhaps a good film might have emerged from the Johnson County Wars. However, \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is an overlong mess - with excessive subtitles, inexplicable nudity, and clouds of dust that obscure the climactic action. The film certainly has its defenders, but the finished product is a depressing waste of time, money and talent. What was Cimino thinking?
B000056H24|2.0|I watched this one with my five year old son, assuring him all the time that this was a movie, that the actor playing Jesus is not Jesus, and that yes, he talks funny.  He still enjoyed it, and I did, too, in parts:  the reaction of the crowd to the raising of Lazarus was brilliant.  But, I'm sorry to say, a Jesus who looks like he's had massive Botox injections in his lower lip and who sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger is a long way from the Jesus we know from the Church's Holy Scripture and holy icons.<br /><br />I don't buy the assessment of reviewers who speak of Max von Sydow's 'quiet dignity' as Jesus:  speaking to the women of Jerusalem while carrying the cross, von Sydow looked and sounded absolutely maniacal.  In much of the film, Scripture is uttered out of context, in the wrong place, or by the wrong person.  Judas is given an excuse for his treachery by the presence of the Devil character, who also whips up the crowd before Pilate.  In short, it's OK for young children, as long as you watch it with them, but don't count on it as Gospel or even a good interpretation of it.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Some movie-loving wizards must have cast a magic spell on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, because it's another grand slam for the Harry Potter franchise. Demonstrating remarkable versatility after the arthouse success of Y Tu Mam Tambin, director Alfonso Cuarn proves a perfect choice to guide Harry, Hermione, and Ron into treacherous puberty as the now 13-year-old students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry face a new and daunting challenge: Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison, and for reasons yet unknown (unless, of course, you've read J.K. Rowling's book, considered by many to be the best in the series), he's after Harry in a bid for revenge. This dark and dangerous mystery drives the action while Harry (the fast-growing Daniel Radcliffe) and his third-year Hogwarts classmates discover the flying hippogriff Buckbeak (a marvelous CGI creature), the benevolent but enigmatic Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), horrifying black-robed Dementors, sneaky Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), and the wonderful advantage of having a Time-Turner just when you need one. The familiar Hogwarts staff returns in fine form (including the delightful Michael Gambon, replacing the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson as the goggle-eyed Sybil Trelawney), and even Julie Christie joins this prestigious production for a brief but welcome cameo. Technically dazzling, fast-paced, and chock-full of Rowling's boundless imagination (loyally adapted by ace screenwriter Steve Kloves), The Prisoner of Azkaban is a Potter-movie classic.

0141439661|4.0|If you are not interested in 19th century society and the roles of women, this story is not for you. The plot is excellent, with many unexpected twists and turns, but the way in which Austen goes about presenting this dramatic story is occasionally hard to follow. Although her descriptions of society in the 19th century are very interesting, they are different than society today, so they are sometimes difficult to understand.<br /><br />Austen presents the roles of women in 19th century society in a new and interesting way. In her book, women were expected to stay at home with the children, and they were not even offered the option of working out of the home. The women in the novel longed only to fall in love, get married, and have children. If they did not get married, they employed themselves in matching younger women with eligible men.<br /><br />The love stories are very intriguing as well. Elinor loves Edward, but hardly shows it, while Marianne falls in love with Willoughby and, through her actions, announces it to the town. Both eventually reach a happy medium where Elinor learns that, in order to win Edward, she has to show her emotions more. Marianne, on the other hand, realizes that she needs to be a little more reserved with her emotions.<br /><br />Overall this is a very interesting book though the language is sometimes hard to follow.
1591840562|5.0|The Art of the Start is an outstanding collection of real world information for first time entrepreneurs. Guy has covered pretty much all of the fundamentals in this book that an entrepreneur will find useful when laying the foundation for a startup and seeing it grow. <br /> <br />The book is not a \\"complete startup bible\\" though. It does give enough lightweight information for the reader to digest and leaves him/her to dig deeper into each of the \\"arts\\". Recommended reading at the end of each chapter should help the reader on this task. <br /> <br />The book has been written mainly for technology entrepreneurs, even though it claims to be for a much wider, general audience. The content is quite simple to understand and to the point, not to forget that it carries with it a sense of humor that is essential to place the reader at ease. <br /> <br />Another suitable title for the book could've been: \\"Inside the Venture Capitalist's Mind\\" as it mainly outlines what a well respected venture capitalist such as Guy expects from an entrepreneur or a startup.  <br /> <br />Involving a VC as your startup's advisor is great even if you don't end up raising his/her money. They see hundreds of startups and are invaluable sources of information. If you can't find any VCs - who are usually very busy with their vested interests in the companies they fund - to advice you in person, then this book could offer a snapshot of their thinking. Hence I'd recommend this book for anyone who not only wants to learn about starting something but also wants to understand the mind of a VC.  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I watched this movie with one of the more accessible (and hotter) chicks I picked up at Lucky's Bar after a night of serious political discussion.  She insisted I learn the \\"truth\\" from this \\"patriot\\" and promised a little \\"special snack\\" if I'd refrain from shouting \\"fat liar\\" during the quieter scenes.  It was hard to argue with these terms and this movie I did watch.  I'd call \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" more propaganda than documentary, but I was literally moved on at least one occasion and would watch again under similar conditions.  Overall, I'd say it's a dishonest bunch of tripe, but well worth seeing if the seating arrangements are in your favor.  Bravo Mr. Moore!  Hoppy stands at attention and salutes you.  Recommended under certain conditions only.  HHD.

B00005JMXX|5.0|Me and my wife watched The Day After Tomorrow on vacation in Orlando, we watched it in a new Movie Theatre, with a fantastic screen and sound presentation, Roland Emmerich seems to know  the obvious in my opinion, that the majority of Movie theatre goers like to watch Science Fiction Fantasy escapist Movies, you just have to look at the top 20 most popular grossing films of all time to see this. TDAT is a supreme film of this genre, amazing visuals, excellent acting from all and a film that combined with the recent Hurricanes in Florida, reminds people that we do not have absloute control of our existence on our planet. Me and my wife laughed outloud durning the segment with Ian Holm and the other British meteorlogical scientests where toasting things they thought were most important in there lives, and it came to the last member in the group and he said \\" God bless Manchester Untited\\" being a Brit living in Usa and a ardent Manchester United soccer supporter it was an unexpected suprise and joy for me and my wife, ahh fond memories of a entertaining film, thank you Roland Emmerich.
B00006BTCA|2.0|I can understand the enthusiasm and approval that has greeted the debut of this band. It's easy to understand when you look around at (and listen to) the scene today. The musicianship strives for something that isn't being supplied elsewhere, and it supposedly conjures the spirit of British avant-rock of approximately 23 years ago. But it really doesn't. They have more in common with Pavement than Joy Division. The fact is that the arty side of the new wave scene circa 79-83 yielded the most intensely accomplished rock of any era; it was rock's high watermark. A moment like that can't be replicated simply by wearing cool clothes and finding a few minor-key chords. If rock was anything like creating music in any ordinary sense of the word, this attempt would have been successful. But it's not. It is (or was) about creating new worlds. (Brian Eno's words). Listening to this album, my consciousness wasn't restructured the way it was when I first heard Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures, Heaven Up Here by Echo and the Bunnymen or Fiction by the Comsat Angels. Comparing this guy's songwriting to Ian Curtis is like comparing the guy in Travis to Morrissey; i.e., a comparison that fails to register.     If you gave this album a good review you probably haven't heard many of the originals. So, go seek out Comsat Angels, Joy Division, Magazine, the Fall, the Bunnymen, Gang of Four, the Cure, the Chameleons, and see if the songwriting here can hold a candle to it, and then come back and edit your review.    Sorry kids, it just doesn't measure up.
B000000OSG|4.0|First off, I am a VERY BIG Gn'R Fan. 'Appetite For Destruction' is the best metal album ever made and one of the best rock albums of all time (just look at the sales).  Now that that's clear, onto the review.  This one is the weaker of the 2 uyi albums.  The first one is just better and more \\"stable\\" than II.  What I mean by that is this album, while really good, has a couple of points which makes u go \\"huh?\\".  For instance, \\"My World\\".  What the hell is this piece of trash?  In a strange way, it's very suiting for the last creation of the original Gn'R.  This song is the direction Guns n' Poseurs is now going in.  It's all Axl.  There is no happy ending to this fairy tale, boys and girls.  In this story, the villain wins.  It's heavily influenced by NIN and Ministry (which is not bad music) and just very self indulgiant (or however u spell it).  It just leaves you with a confused feeling when they could've ended it with a BANG.  When I finished listening to this album, the experience of it was soured by this song.  It was juxtaposed next to an alternate version of 'Don't Cry'.  While the lyrics are good, I don't get it.  Couldn't you get it right the first time?  I like both, but, I just don't get why they did this.  Maybe, if you stop listening after 'You Could Be Mine' and think of these songs as bonus tracks, the album ends on a better note.  I guess I just wanted a little more from the last gasp of Gn'R. <br />   Now that I've complained, I'll compliment.  This is a really good album.  Whilst you may be weary of the ballads on both, give them a chance, they're actually good (if you have the time to listen to them.)  And Slash...one...of...the...best.  Talent AND style, what more could you want?  And just a little note: will people PLEASE start to recognize izzy as a true under rated talent.  He was the backbone of Gn'R.  He let everyone else take credit for a lot of what HE did.  Granted, when you're in a band it's one for all, etc., but still, the point is, hedid what he did for the right reasons, MUSIC.  All he wanted to do was be in the background and strum his guitar.  And when he felt that the band had lost its soul, he left.  AT THE HIEGHT OF THEIR SUCCESS, no less.  Izzy is a TRUE ROCKER and REBEL.  I respect him.  Anyway, he was crutial on this album.  His contributions to both these 2 albums and \\"Appetite...\\" go, for some reason, unrecognized. <br />   So, though you may have not known it in '91, this was the last trace of new music from gn'r.  We wait for Chinese democracy.  Ya know, there's a joke I heard in relation to this: How many Gn'R fans does it take to screw in a light bulb? <br />none.  They all sit in the dark room staring at the dead light bulb saying \\"don't worry, it'll come on again.  And when it does, it'll f***ing shine.\\"  I think that sums up my feelings about this new album and band.  At least we have these albums.  If you've questioned buying this album, trust me, it is worth a try at least.  They can't hold a candle to appetite, but then again, few albums can.  They deserve to be respected as a good effort, if for nothing else.
B0000028UK|5.0|This album was released in a period of Pearl Jam's career in which they were extremely famous and possibly the most famous band in the world. Grunge was all over MTV, and their album 'Ten' millions and millions of copies. Pearl Jam tried to shred a few of their fans with this one.    This album is an extreme departure from the arena rock anthem-filled 'Ten'. PJ upped the rage meter, and started to make harder songs with fewer guitar solos. Vedder sings his heart out on this one, while it's not his best vocals, 'Vs.' contains some awesome ones, with Vedder even tiring his voice out on some songs.    The first half of the album is pretty much, aside from \\"Daughter\\" just straight forward awesome hard rock songs. The first two songs (\\"Go\\" and \\"Animal\\") are straight hard rockers. These take a couple of listens for appreciation, but they are great songs with AWESOME guitar solos. PJ slows down some for the next song, \\"Daughter\\". Almost completely acoustic, this song has great calm vocals from Vedder. \\"Glorified G\\" is probably my least favorite song on the album. It's basically a straight hard rock song. \\"Dissident\\" integrates a blues-like melody into the PJ sound. Don't get me wrong, this song rocks quite hard, and it has EXCELLENT vocals from Vedder. Now, here comes the okayness of \\"W.M.A.\\". I've never enjoyed this song very much, partly because it lasts forever, but it has some AWESOME bass by Ament.    Now, here is the STRONG second half of the album. This is when PJ perfects on this album. I don't really know what Eddie was thinking when he wrote \\"Blood\\", but it must have been odd, because this song is absolutely insane, and definately the heaviest song on the album. There is basically NO melody, and Eddie's vocals are strained. THE SONG IS STILL AWESOME THOUGH. Many people consider \\"Rearviewmirror\\" to be the album's masterpiece, and I am not an exception. This song is absolutely AMAZING. The lyrics are purely AMAZING, along with the music and Vedder's vocals. Definately give it a listen. If you like funk, \\"Rats\\" is the perfect song for you. This song is loaded with some awesome bass from Jeff, and some odd vocals from Eddie. \\"...Small Town\\" is a cool song, besides having the longest title of any PJ song, it also has a nice acoustic folk melody. I personally prefer this one over \\"Daughter\\". \\"Leash\\" is a punkish rocker, probably the closest thing on this album to their next album, \\"Vitalogy\\". GREAT vocals from Eddie, and some awesome music. The album slows down for another GREAT close in \\"Indifference\\". This song is just fantastic, and makes for the perfect close to an already perfect album.    Pearl Jam would take their rage with them for one more album, \\"Vitalogy\\". Then they lost it all and softened their melodies, proving that they are always changing.
B0001611DI|5.0|Before discussing the film, as though I need to waste time outlining the plot and meaning of such an epochal horror film as \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" I would like to make a few comments about the DVDs. Personally, I have watched this film several times over the years and by this point have little idea of which versions I have seen or enjoyed the most. I am a viewer who always likes to see the uncut, unedited version of any movie because I do not enjoy the idea of someone else deciding what I can or cannot see. How many versions of this film exist? At least four, I think, although I'm sure there are more.  O.K., censors will do what censors do and we can do little about it except shake our heads and look for an uncut foreign version. But let's acknowledge something important about the numerous versions of this film and the movie's central theme. Romero used this installment of his zombie franchise to critique the rampant consumerism in American society, right? Isn't it more than a bit ironic there are so many versions of this film? In other words, a movie excoriating uncontrolled materialism requires fans to continually go out and buy the latest updated version. I'd laugh if it weren't so ridiculous.<br /><br />Anyway, here we go. The mysterious plague, event, or whatever it is that caused the dead to rise in the first film has now become global in its implications. Mass chaos breaks out across the United States and presumably the world. Television stations broadcast emergency information that usually results in more harm than help, and the police and military services fight a losing battle in areas loaded with the shambling dead. A tense series of showdowns in an infested apartment complex show the seriousness of the problem. Not only do you have flesh-seeking zombies to worry about, citizens going nuts and shooting at the cops become a real problem as well. It's obvious civilization teeters on the brink of utter collapse, so media personality Fran (Gayleen Ross), her boyfriend and chopper pilot Stephen (David Emge), and two police officers involved in the failed raid on the apartment building, Roger (Scott Reinger) and Peter (Ken Foree), decide to fly the friendly skies to anywhere but the city. They run into a few problems along the way, such as a pitched battle with a bunch of zombies near a refueling depot out in the countryside, but the quartet eventually achieves some sense of safety when they hole up in a huge shopping mall out in the sticks.<br /><br />As the four set up shop in the mall, they have to go about a series of housecleaning chores. Romero treats us to lengthy scenes of Scott and Peter loping around the mall making sure the place is safe. We see the two cops running through stores, avoiding zombies all the way, to gather supplies. They discover a storage room tucked away in the rear of the mall and work to turn it into a base of operations. Scott and Peter even risk life and limb (pun intended) to drive huge big rigs up to the doors of the mall, thus effectively blocking the shambling dead from entering the building. Then the bloodletting begins as the group raids a gun shop and promptly exterminates every flesh eater in the mall. These scenes, while lengthy and seemingly mundane in the context of the larger picture, actually serve an important purpose. By showing our heroes setting up shop in the mall, Romero helps give the film a sense of civilization attempting to rebuild itself. And with the resumption of civilization, apparently, comes the greedy materialism inherent in modern life. Fran, Stephen, Scott, and Peter soon spend most of their time shopping and enjoying the exquisite goods available in the various shops. By the time a motley motorcycle gang appears on the scene to plunder the mall (led by Tom Savini!), a three way battle erupts between our heroes, the thugs, and the zombies now allowed to once again roam through the mall.<br /><br />Romero's second installment of his famed Dead Trilogy is such a wonder to behold due to several important factors. The materialism theme steals most of the attention because, frankly, it's great to see someone add such depth to a nihilistic horror film. I appreciated the gore that, although infrequent, really makes an impact when it pops up. You've got zombies munching on victuals in gluey close up, a grotesque tete a tete (heh!) with helicopter blades, lots of exploding heads, and a bunch of motorcycle pirates coming apart at the seams. Even more amazing is the black humor infusing this fantastic film. For instance, have you ever seen a pie fight involving reanimated, decaying corpses? You will here. \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" can't get any better, right? Wrong. That's Goblin you hear performing the score for the film. Yep, Romero got the group responsible for so many of Dario Argento's creepy film scores to do the soundtrack for \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\" In fact, Dario helped out with this film. Simply amazing. Fans couldn't put together a dream lineup like this if they tried.<br /><br />I'm not going to mention extras except to say each of the different versions contains different stuff. I see there is now an \\"Ultimate Edition\\" set that contains so many extras as to boggle the mind. I'm wondering if I should just buy the ultimate collection and be done with it because I've avoided buying any version. Frankly, I don't appreciate the greed involved in the distribution of this film. Romero followed this film up with the awesomely gory \\"Day of the Dead,\\" another must see classic in the horror canon. Enjoy!ch a wonder to behold due to several important factors.

B0002MB7QW|2.0|I saw the preveiw for this movie, and was hyped up. I watched and read reviews, saw TV spots, and got so excited about it, not only for the awesome looking special effects and great concept, but the shrewd political commentary, including the casting of an ignorant vice president that bore a striking resemblance to Dick Cheney, and a young-looking clueless president who was introduced wearing a golf jacket, saying, \\"Uh, what do you think we should do?\\" <br /> <br />The movie had a great set-up, and introduced the characters well, and I was thinking to myself throughout the first half-hour, \\"I am so buying this on DVD\\". After 30 minutes, the movie slowed down, and began to become more and more absurdly written with obvious, by-the-book plot twists and changes and horribly chlichd cliff-hangers. <br /> <br />Somewhere into the second hour, I had been lost completely wondering how could they have taken this great idea, great cast, huge chunk of money, and army CGI Special Effects artists and made this movie so incredibly bad? <br /> <br />It's set sometime in this decade, give or take a year, in a world where the climate is being effeced hyper-rapidly by global warming, in a reverse effect where global warming triggers an ice-age, by the melting of the ice caps and rising of ocean levels, air currents that flow warm and cold air are scewed, virtually freezing the Northern Hemisphere in a sheet of ice. A climatologist (the name has eluded me) is aware of what's going on, but doesn't no when or how such cataclysmic events will take hold. His son, who is head over heals for a friend of his (her name hasn't remainded in my head either) and joins his school's national academic team because she does. They fly to New York City to compete against various schools in a competition, and unfortunately, get caught in a massive title wave and flood of Manhattan do to rising sea levels. The giant lake that was once Manhattan island freezes over, trapping all residents of the island that couldn't escape. This includes the girl, the boy, and their nerdy friend, who is president of the math, chess and science club. They and a few dozen people get stuck in the Manhattan Public Library, and sends the father and two of his colleages on a rescue mission to save them. <br /> <br />Ok, great. We have the idea, we have the special effects. But we don't have a movie. As I mentioned earlier, the setup is great, but beyond the first 30 minutes of the movie you get increasingly bored. Instead of turning the survival in the public library in freezing conditions with no heat or water into a Donner-Party type battle for survival, they turn it into more of a happy camping trip with no real problems, just the occasional referance to discomfort. The girl cuts her leg early into the movie, but you know that there will be a problem later on, and suspense is killed once again. And even when she does cut her leg, you know she's far to hot to be one of the dead characters, and even if she became one, you wouldn't care because of poorly drawn characters. <br /> <br />The jouurney of the father is boring as well, because no excitement goes on. They don't encounter any trouble, except for when of the father's colleages sacrifices himself to save the other two, but his death has no relevance to the story, and he has no background or developement whatsoever. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a very watchable movie with good laughs, including anticdotes of Americans crossing illegally into Mexico after the country seals it's boarders and various subplots and supporting characters including a bum and his dog--to of the stranded people in the library. <br /> <br />This could have been great had they made the journey of the father a strenuous, pain-staking journey, and the library situation into a Donner Party of sorts, and truly developed the characters. But sadly, they didn't, and that's why they got a sad two-stars from me, and I wouldn't have been so generous had their beenno cool special effects. <br /> <br />Eh, watch it if you want, but don't make it a first priority.
B000002KKS|4.0|This album is a hard rock classic..Iommi's guitar tones on this album, along with great vocals, neat songwriting, and a real sense of purpose (we're back without Ozzy, so check it out) made this the dio-sabbath mothership. Mob Rules, although it had a few good tunes, cannot touch this. Is it only me that finds Iommi's vibrato a bit spooky?? He is the irreverant man in black. <br />You will not find a better album on this site for the price they want for it. Unfortunately, I have this, and everything else that I want on the site is like 23.99 and up :-(. Plus the S&amp;H. Bummer.<br />Rock on........even if your music is from the past, and you are 35 and losing your hair. :-)
B000063UR2|5.0|This is the only film I remember so vividly watching the first week it went to the theatres.  I was in High School.  I have never been a huge movie fan, but I love this movie.<br /><br />Now at 35, my 6 year old daughter loves it too.  I was worried it would scare her but when it was over she just said, \\"I loved it mommy.\\"  I have rented it so many times since it first came out on video and now dvd.  It is time to just buy it.<br /><br />It is actually a beautiful movie.  I remember loving that the most in the theatre, and now on my TV.<br /><br />It is so worth a try.  Remember it was about 1986...so it isn't super hi-tech.  And it may not have done well at that time...but critics are often WRONG!!<br /><br />It has been loved by many for many years now!
0694003611|5.0|Summary:  A young rabbit says goodnight to everything in his room while he prepares for bedtime. <br /> <br />Evaluation:  This is the perfect bedtime story for any young child.  The illustrations cleverly get darker from page to page as the sun sets and it is time for the rabbit to go to sleep.  Children will enjoy finding all of the objects within the illustrations that the rabbit says goodnight to.  What is especially challenging is finding the small mouse in every picture.  He moves every time you turn the page!
0142004413|5.0|As a young boy I was forced, with some considerable reluctance, to read 'My Family and Other Animals' by one of teachers at my school in England, 'in order to improve my vocabulary'. All is forgiven, Mr Cox, for within my rather battered copy lurked, without doubt,  the most hilarious account of familial eccentricity, and light-hearted feuding that I have ever come across. <br /> <br />The book, as Mr Durrell explains in introduction, was intended to describe the glorious flora and fauna of Corfu, a greek island where he spent some time as a child. In this goal, he has succeeded admirably, as the whole atmosphere of the island is exquisitely recreated, to an extent that even on a rainy afternoon in Sidcup, it is not difficult to be transported to a sunny morning in the Aegean watching a young Gerry discovering a nest of a trapdoor spider, or perhaps discovering something of the mating rituals of the greek tortoise. <br /> <br />It is in the descriptions of the family, however, where this book really comes to life. As Mr Durrell describes in the introduction, the family, as in life, once they had begun to appear, muscled their way into the rest of pages as well. From tales of the rotund, pretentious Larry (Lawrence Durrell, of the Alexandria Quartet fame), the gun-mad Leslie and the 'muslin and gauze' swathed sister, Margot, to the desciptions the long-suffering mother, the family had me laughing out loud at the most inopportune moments. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I read it regularly, and am still crying with laughter all the way through. Not only a splendid book for the evocative descriptions of the natural history, this is the most witty book I have ever read.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Firstly Im a huge S & G fan and have heard all their released work,but would rate this a little less then PSR&T and esp Bookends,both classics.However this is still a wonderful album with some of S&Gs finest work,including the beautiful but overproduced titular track,the Boxer and the truly gorgeous Only Living Boy in NY.El condor pasa & Cecilia,Song for the Asking are also standout tracks.For me the biggest blooper HAS to be the totally useless 'live' version of bye bye love,an ordinary song at very best.Baby driver & Why don't you write me are also fairly ordinary but at least entertaining.Overall a great album that could have been greater with some editing.
B000005DQR|5.0|Dj Shadow makes his own introduction. He not only asks to lead you down an uncertain path, he makes it the only path you need to follow.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|I liked this album greatly, especially the songs that evoked my favorite Ray Charles album--Modern Sounds in Country/Western Music. The Willie Nelson duet is awful, but Willie has drug that song around TOO long. The James Taylor song is great I liked the sound of Johnny Mathis and Ray even if I think the song selection was bizarre. Also liked the Diana Krall, Bonnie Raitt and Natalie Cole selections.
B00028HBKC|5.0|this movie, in a very graphic way, shows how CHRIST died at the hands of violent people who did not  know who he was, but JESUS  was willing to endure his fate..when i think of my children it is so hard to understand GODS deep love for his children, that he gave his only BEGOTTEN SON. i am so glad that he loves us that much.....a wonderful movie, it is very heart wretching and someone with a heart condition should be very careful when they watch it.....mell gibson is my most favorite director................
B000002H97|4.0|After hearing so much hype surrounding this album, one would think that it would be Metallica's high point. Well its not as good as Master of Puppets and their other earlier cds, but it seems to be their last great release before they went even more mainstream.  There were a few songs that I didn't care for on here, but the great ones more than make up for it. Anyway pick this up if you don't already have it and if you have this and want even better Metallica then grab Master of Puppets.
0792163710|4.0|I agree that this is a classic, and that it inspired many other westerns that followed (drifter with a hidden past helps a town/settlers get rid of the bad guys), but there are certainly some flaws that can be a bit annoying... <br /> <br />(and these aren't nitpicks, btw...) <br /> <br />1. The music is overdone. It's present in the most simple scenes, such as the family and Shane eating dinner.  And on important scenes, but LONG scenes, it just gets bigger and bigger, as if it came in the scene too quick. <br /> <br />2. The kid, \\"little Joey.\\" Could this kid BE more annoying?  <br /> <br />3. The editing, especially in the fight scene.  The bar room brawl is a great classic western brawl, don't get me wrong. But the editor/director chose to put in way too many close ups at the wrong time. Again, this isn't a nitpick, but the fight scene is a really long one, so the bad editing is really noticable. <br /> <br />other than those 3 things. This really is a good flick, with decent acting all around. Especially from the bad guys (Ben Johnson, Edgar Buchanan, and although Jack Palance doesn't say much, it's fun to watch him as a ruthless killer). <br /> <br />if you're a fan of classic westerns, this is indeed a \\"must own\\".
B000063DGC|5.0|Glad to see you all worship me so that I have my own live tribute album. Let me ask you a question, which guitarist has an offical live tribute album? Is it Angus Young, no. Jimi Paige, hell no! Does Eddie Van Halen have an offical live tribute album with him on it? Nope, just me, just Randy Rhoads! That just shows how greater I am than all of those losers combined!!!! Even the great guitar god Jimi Hendrix can't compare to me, although I got to say he got a hell of alot close. Well that's because like me, Jimi Hendrix died young and of natural causes, not like that fag Kurt Cobain! No one could match my speed and vitruousity and day of the week, I am simply the best. And what is this that I am hearing about how people say that I ripped of Eddie Van Halen? I didn't rip of Van Halen because I played a hell of alot better than he did and I didn't play sissy pop/metal crap guitar! I played f#cking metal guitar!!!!! <br /> <br />                      Only the good die young, <br />                      Randy F@$king Rhoads <br />
B00012FXAE|5.0|Alien was a brilliantly claustrophobic film, a haunted house in space, so to speak.  To try and repeat it would have been folly for James Cameron, so instead he crafted a new and different film, and argubly the best action movie of all time.<br /><br />The movie opens with a silent spaceship, the escape-pod Narcissus, drifting through space.  The silence continues as the camera pans around the inside of the craft, before a deafiningly loud blowtorch breaks the silence.  Such is the way this billiant movie is set up.  The first part is all build-up, the second part all action.  It works beautifully.<br /><br />No one will beleive Ellen Ripley's story of an alien life-form on her ship (from the original Alien) the Nostromo.  Her pilot liscence is revoked and she is in a fairly ignominious position.  But then things start going wrong.  The ominous \\"company\\" has lost contact with LV-426, the planet in which the Nostromo set down and picked up the Alien.<br /><br />Ripley sets down on LV426 with the Colonial Marines, by far one of the most \\"kick***\\" and cool bunch of soldiers ever depicted in a movie, from Bill Paxton in one of his few good roles to Al Matthews as another colorful Sargent. There are gradually more and more signs of hostile action until the first contact with the aliens, after which its all white-knuckle action.<br /><br />There is nothing to critize here.  The characters are all flawlessly portrayed, evoking real feeling from the audience.  The action seqences are all wonderfully choreographed and edited, the aliens fierce and gruesome, the future technology practical and engaging, the music brilliant.  I'm running out of superlatives, and I can't reccomend this movie enough.  Be sure to watch the Special Edition, as it adds even more human element (another well-handled factor I beleive I forgot to mention) and some really neat action sequences.<br />Director's Cut: 10/10<br />Original Cut: 9/10
B00003CXCT|1.0|As a fan of the original films - I refuse to spend money on something that is modified or enhanced. I find this to be the biggest problem with the movie industry. Lucas's vision to blend the two films together is understandable but I refuse to watch these films with the added enhancements. I enjoyed the original films and even moreso since the prequels have been released. George Lucas has a very creative mind thus giving us Star Wars but why mess with something that was classic? That redefined how we view films today? Call me old-fashioned but once a film that is as well loved and respected and revered has been released to the public - embraced by the public, I think Lucas should show some respect to the fans who were and are still loyal to the original films that were released without the enhancements. From reading the reviews - I am very glad to know that I have not wasted my money on Lucas's \\"vision\\" of how the films \\"should\\" be versus how they were then. I own the original films on VHS and prize them more than the box set that was released just recently. Plus, I've seen the A&E documentary on the making of the films so - no loss there either.<br /><br />Another point is - directors should respect the work they do and not emhance or modify what they think needs to be modified. Spielberg has yet to enhance or modify anything. Some directors I guess realize that your best work is the work you do with the tools and equipment you have at the time that you have them. There's no going back to change this or change that. I'm sorry but I felt that I must vent my fustration with this sordid practice.
B00004T9UF|4.0|When Eminem first arrived on the scene, I, like many, didn't take him seriously. When I first heard \\"My Name Is\\", I thought that Vanilla Ice had been resurrected, but that was far from the truth. The Slim Shady LP was a brief look in to the life and times of Marshall Mathers, from husband, father and aspiring rapper. Though the content wasn't for the faint of heart, it was refreshing to hear musically and lyrically duing the birth of hip hop's \\"bling bling era\\". His next album, The Marshall Mathers LP, would turn the world on its ear, not only musically, but commercially, selling nearly 2 million in its first week. This is easily Dr. Dre's best production work since Snoop Dogg's undeniable classic, Doggystyle. If you didn't like what Em had to say on his first album,stop reading now. There are songs with refences to homophobia(Marshall Mathers,I'm Back),killing his wife and the mother of his child(Kim)and trashy rumors(The Real Slim Shady). Some of pop's music's top dogs get trashed on I'm Back and The Real Slim Shady. There are some standout songs though, like Remember Me with Sticky Fingaz and RBX, Bitch Please II with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg,Xzibit and Nate Dogg, and of course, Stan, about a deranged fan who takes his obsession with Slim over the edge. Though the album stumbles a bit with Criminal and Under The Influence(featuring D-12, who's mere presence brings down ANY album), this is more than worthy to take up space in your CD collection. My only problem is that(which I know has been said countlessly over the last couple of years)the reason why Eminem is praised so highly for his skills and sells so may records is beause he is white. I know that he has had to prove himself twice as hard to get respect, but he has reaped twice the credit, which is unfair to all the great black lyricists that have come before him and influenced him(Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, KRS-ONE,2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G, Kool G. Rap) and the great ones out know(Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Black Thought, Xzibit, Ras Kass, Nas, Jay-Z, Method Man, Redman, Keith Murray, Outkast, etc). It's hilarious to me to hear white rock and pop fans that proclaim this as the greatest rap album fo all time, yet know jack about the music; if they hadn't already known, hip hop had been around for twenty years before Eminem arrived on the scene; go do your homework.
B0002O7XWC|5.0|\\"Easy Rider\\" directed by Dennis Hopper, produced by Peter Fonda and written by Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Terry Southern was a low budget film ($340 grand) that surprisingly became a box office smash. The story is about two hippys (Fonda & Hopper) who buy choppers with cash they've gotten from a drug deal. They ride cross country heading to Louisianna (to Mardi Gras) and on their way meeting different people, visiting a commune of hippys, ending up in jail, going to a brothel, taking acid etc. The ending was disturbing in 1969 and still is, even in these days of non-stop violence in our country. This 35th Anniversary Edition is identical to the regular dvd version of \\"Easy Rider\\" with the exact same bonus material \\"The Making-Of Documentary \\"Easy Rider: Shaking The Cage\\" (feat. interviews with Fonda, Hopper, etc.) and an audio commentary by Dennis Hopper plus production notes. The bonuses for this 35th Anniversary Edition are a cd which includes eight songs (do not confuse this cd with the actual \\"Easy Rider Soundtrack\\" as it is not). The songs are \\"Born To Be Wild\\" - Steppenwolf, \\"The Weight\\" - Smith, \\"Nights In White Satin\\" - The Moody Blues, \\"Wasn't Born To Follow\\" - The Byrds, \\"San Francisco Nights\\" - Eric Burden And The Animals, \\"The Pusher\\" - Steppenwolf, \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" - Roger McGuinn and \\"Get Together\\" - The Youngbloods. The 80 page book \\"Easy Rider\\" by Lee Hill is interesting and includes all you'll ever want to know about the film. The bottom line is, if you already own the regular dvd of \\"Easy Rider\\" I'd pass on this 35th Anniversary Edition. Of course, if you don't own this classic film it may be worth the extra cash for the bonus cd and book.
B0001MDPV8|3.0|Don't get me wrong; the original version of Illmatic is a MUST have. This version, however, I can do with out; and it's all thanks to the second disk. The \\"updated\\" remixes drone out the original quality of the first one; a couple of those were already inlcuded on his Illmatic To Stillmatic remix album. That's what makes the re-release of Notorious B.I.G's Ready to Die great; because it includes rare tracks that are hard to find, and doesn't bring down the quality of the original recording. Just get the original version.
B00028HBKM|5.0|\\"Beware of false prophets, who come to you dressed as sheep, but inside they are devouring wolves.  You will fully recognize them by their fruits.  Do people pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?  Even so, every healthy (sound) tree bears good fruit [worthy of admiration], but the sickly (decaying, worthless) tree bears bad (worthless) fruit.  A good (healthy) tree cannot bear bad (worthless) fruit, nor can a bad (diseased) tree bear excellent fruit [worthy of admiration].  Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.  Therefore, YOU WILL FULLY KNOW THEM BY THEIR FRUITS.\\" ~ Mt. 7:15-20 (Amp.) <br /> The Passion was my 12 and 14 year old daughters first movie rated above PG, before or since its release.  They both had nothing but tears of joy to see the vivid affirmation on that theater screen that they were so deeply loved - as did we all.  Brutal? Yes!  Painful?  Definitely!  Heart wrenching?  Most certainly - as it should be.  It wasn't a \\"walk in the park\\" for Christ.  He knew before-hand, and He still chose to SUFFER for us so that we could have and enjoy life in abundance.   <br /> Mel Gibson's The Passion depicts the truth as Jesus Christ (The Truth) experienced it according to the written gospels. It wasn't a pretty site, but it is a beautiful reality.  Sometimes the truth hurts ... so that you can be healed.  <br /> \\"You will know them by their fruits\\" - at all three of the theatrical viewing's I went to (apart from church assemblies) I witnessed several groups and couples enter with negative and often cruel words and countenances, and yet leave in tears of conviction and love with their arms around each other.  Conviction mind you - NOT condemnation.  Since then I've heard numerous reports of transformed lives.  Transformed to glory and goodness, yet never once violence or cruelty.  Looks like good fruit to me!   <br /> In conclusion and with all love, I'll remind and implore the Sad-u-ccees to \\"Touch Not The Anointed.\\"   It's far more satisfying and beneficial to edify and reap that harvest.  Selah!
B0002OERI0|5.0|We've all seen it before, when a band reaches its creative peak, and just puts together a tremendous album.  We all know there is no way the album could ever be duplicated, or topped.  Well, this album, \\"American Idiot\\" from Green Day, is their best.  It's surprising to me, that such an album would come 14+ years into Green Day's existence.  Most of the time, these creative peaks are reached on the debut album, or possibly the 2nd or 3rd.<br /><br />I wasn't, and am still not a big fan of the song \\"American Idiot\\", but that doesn't take away from the album in the least.  That song is more vintage Green Day than others.  \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is my favorite GD song of all-time.  It's a 9+ minute epic, with a wide range of highs and lows, and excellent lyrics.  I'd have to go with \\"St. Jimmy\\" as the lone clunker on the album.  Almost resorted to a garage band sound with that one, and it didn't work for me.<br /><br />Didn't want to put any negatives in here, because this album is a thing of beauty.  If you're a Green Day fan, you can't miss this album.  This is the kind of album that was more than likely some sort of spiritual experience in the studio.  Everything clicking on all cylinders.  It's as close as Green Day will ever get to a masterpiece, and you can bet your bottom dollar, that this album will receive high praise.
0345451325|5.0|This is a must read for Halo fans. I read this book in 1 day, almost without stopping. That's how good it was. Even people who aren't Halo fans but like to read sci-fi will love this book. It's also the best of the three Halo books out now, in my opinion, although First Strike comes close.
0553573403|5.0|I cannot recommend this book highly enough..the plot is extremely compex, but followable, and engages you attention completely every moment you are reading it.  I recently went back and read the entire series again, and enjoyed it even more the second time around, as I picked out more of the subtler foreshadowing and plot details.  This is by far the best fantasy book I have ever read, with black blurring into white all over the place, a completely original plot that does not adhere to the typical \\"laws of fantasy\\", and stunningly witty dialogue- you will not be disappointed if you read this.
B00005JMX6|5.0|I got this movie just thinking it would be another teen movie that would be good watching for a Friday nite. Boy was I wrong. Let's get this out of the way first: Elisha Cuthbert is THE Goddess! I have followed her career all the way from Popular Mechanics for Kids, through 24, and now The Girl Next Door. She's come a long way, and it's nice to see someone as beautiful and talennted as her finaly get a time to shine. <br /> <br />Anyone who watches this movie should be suprised at the quality of it. It is not like your average teen movie, it keeps you guessing the whole way through and has a lot of twists and turns that will keep you watches (If you can take your eyes off Elisha for a second) If you are just seeing this movie for Elisha u get plenty of her, and a good story is told also. GO GET THIS MOVIE!!!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Up front, TV shows that like to showcase a too-good-to-be-true view of the world give me the cooties.  The Gilmore Girls, though partaking of some of that fantasy small town Americana, transcends its apparent limitations to be perhaps the best dramody currently on the tube.  Aside from the great Lorelei/Rory two kinds of people in the world/who do you like best test (currently I'm tending towards Lorelei since Rory cut off her hair and became a homewrecker), the non-stop snappy writing and admirable narrative pacing set this series way apart from the squirming drivel filling the airwaves.  Sure, the characters and setting are theoretically way too cute, but the acting chops displayed by Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel (particularly) are first-rate, gloriously complimenting the fine writing and direction of the show.  All this and a family-friendly content that still maintains its edge and hipness.  Great music (though the Carol King theme song is not my fave), two of the most magically delicious female leads in television, and a densely meaty narrative that holds up as individual shows and a compelling meta story.  Bledel is a magnetic performer who will hopefully break out at some point; she is a natural actor of consummate skill, amazing for someone who pretty much started out from scratch in the series.   <br />AND IT IS NOT JUST A WOMEN'S SHOW!! <br />Definitely start from the beginning and savor the first season DVD.  Rory Falling In Love is a wonderful story arc, played for sentiment but not sentimental.  Lauren Graham is fabulously watchable and an actress on a par with the apex of 40's screwball comedy. The ancillary characters are a bit sketchy in the first season, though Scott Patterson's unrequited Luke is a resonant performance of note.
0375422889|5.0|In the second installment of Marjane Satrapi's retelling of her coming of age we find our heroine lost in Europe. Confused about who she is and what the world sees her as she falls into a series of misadventures before returning to her home country of Iran. It is a beautifully told story about a girl becoming a woman and coming to terms with her turbulent heritage. There aren't enough awards you could give Satrapi for her brilliant work. She has captured her life story with honesty and amazing talent. Reading her books is a joy and I only hope that she will put out a third volume in the future. I will never tire of hearing her story.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|The reason this film will stand after others have fallen isn't necessarily because of the perspective it gives us on a transformative era, nor the thinish plot line that's developed.  Instead it compares to a film like 8 1/2 in that it's a story about the demands of the creative process. <br /> <br />A photographer, putting together a collection of his photos filled with images of urban despair, believes he's found the perfect image to end his portfolio: a couple embracing in a park.  But as our photographer looks closer, he sees something more menacing.  In the shadowy background of the image he finds one man holding a pistol and another lying dead on the ground. <br /> <br />The film, infuriatingly directionless at times (like one's twenties), witnesses our young photographer's obsession with returning to the scene and capturing the sensational image of the dead man.   <br /> <br />At various points in the film we're shown the frustration of creating -- the photographer utterly disgusted with the models he shoots, a young antique shop owner wearily dreaming of a Moroccan getaway, a disaffected artist who seems to paint only to store his paintings for years at a time never showing or selling them.   <br /> <br />They are all looking for that \\"one thing\\" that captures their respective visions.  What might be called the climax (though I hesitate to call any particular scene climactic) has the Yardbirds playing to a crowd of stultified young people.  A glitch in one of the stage speakers sets the guitarist off as he smashes the instrument to bits on the stage.  Suddenly, the crowd comes alive as he throws the neck of the guitar into the melee on the floor.  The photographer grabs the neck and fights his way through the throng only to emerge outside looking confusedly at this suddenly foreign object.  Examining it for a moment he tosses it to the ground.  As he struts off screen another person picks the piece up only to throw it right back on the sidewalk.   <br /> <br/>The guitar neck was an artifact from a momentary event that has meaning only to those who were part of it.  And even then, its meaning is fleeting.  The difficulty of capturing this moment and giving it lasting meaning infuses the spirit of this film.   <br /> <br />I'd recommend this movie only if you're in the mood to devote some real time to it.  It's deceptively thought provoking and isn't a great movie to just \\"give a watch\\".  But given time it is ripe to a number of interpretations and great for all the layers that can be pulled away.
B0002DB50E|4.0|The TV producer Max Renn (James Woods) works for a sleazy TV network that focuses on violence, sex, and other bizarre programs.  Max's job is to search and find programs that keep pushing the aggressive nature of the network and can keep the viewer numbers up.  Years of exposure to violence and sex have diminished the effect that the brutality and sexuality have on Max.  As a result Max continues to search for something rough and more sadistic, and through an employee of the network he finds a pirate cable show, Videodrome.<br /><br />The nature of the Videodrome is as Max refers to it as, \\"It's just murder and torture. No plot. No characters.\\"  It is the cutting edge, no pun intended, of cable TV for Max as it is rougher and more brutal than anything else that he has seen.  Max tapes the show and becomes fixated with the pirated shows.  This also begins to affect Max's social life as he meets Nicki (Deborah Harry) with whom he initiates a sadistic romance.  Max begins to track the source down for Videodrome, which initially seems to be sent from Malaysia.  However, further investigation leads Max to Pittsburgh, and he realizes that it is connected with a nightmarish cult.<br /><br />David Cronenberg creates a terrifying atmosphere where reality and delusions begin to blend.  This shadow land draws the audience into a paranoid cinematic experience where the threat is located directly in front of them, the television.  The exceptional special effects are a big part of creating the bizarre atmosphere, which are startling with the breathing video tapes, open stomachs, and a sensually moving television.  Videodrome carries Cronenberg's distinctive insignia as it is unique, disturbing, and groundbreaking.  As usual with Cronenberg, his films always create room for cerebral participation and reflection as there are always several messages, which can be seen in other films by Cronenberg such as Spider and Naked Lunch.  When Videodrome's end credits roll over the screen the audience will have experienced a truly unique film, which will cause much room for debate and pondering.the audience will have experienced a truly unique film, which will cause much room for debate and pondering.  <br />
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Who would spend so much money and time making this waste of a movie?! The actors/actresses look like amateurs, much of the effects look very unrealistic, I never really understood the plot behind the movie (but I have a feeling it's anything but deep), Dracula looks like a \\"pale\\" Gary Oldman-wannabe (Oldman did the best Dracula ever by the way, so this guy should never have tried to copy him, it looks pathetic), you realize this project had the money, but no talent, no talent at all (rather impressive) - and of course I bought the darn thing without seing it first, my mistake. It's actually so boring I haven't seen the end of the movie yet, and I don't care who wins, who dies, nor how... The mummy was better, but rather thin that one as well - the mystery to me is how this director finds his producers and cast, these movies cost a fortune to make - but in my opinion he totally fails.
B000067CPX|4.0|Like all the reviewers before me, I would like to state that By The Way is a strong album. Its a album where the Red Hot Chili Peppers are back at their very best. In this album throughout the songs they successfully ride and merge the boundaries of different music variants such as rock, grunge and hip-hop. It's an exhilerating ride and all songs are easy to listen too.<br /><br />By The Way, Zephyr Song, Midnight, Tear and Minor Thing are my personal favourites of this album. Its one heck of a album and one I will continue to listen to for a long time to come.
B00003CXB2|4.0|More than any other film \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" frustrates me.  I'll start my review by listing the strengths of this film.  David Lean was the last great director of historical epics.  He has all the elements in place here: great cinematography, editing, a fantastic score by Maurice Jarre.  Peter O'Toole's debut is nothing less than astonishing.  He does not so much star here as Lawrence but embodies the man, with all the contradictions and complexities.  There is a great supporting cast here with Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer.  But...this film is just so long.  I understand that what Lean is trying to convey here is that the unification of the Arab tribes against their Turk opressors was a long and deliberate process.  And we in the audience feel the long and deliberate process.  If Lean wants us to feel that the trek through the desert was arduous, well, he has succeeded.  My review of this film is not based on a single viewing of it.  I have seen it many times but getting through it is hard work.  In a nutshell, I admire this film but I don't particularly enjoy it.  On a final note, the first time I saw \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" about 20 years ago at a repertory movie-house, about three-quarters of the way through it the theatre lights came on and the theatre manager came out and told the audience that they were missing the last two reels of the film.  Imagine my dismay after investing well over two hours of my time to this film and not knowing how it ended!!!  It's possible that initial exposure to this film colored my impression of it.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Terence Fisher's stunning 1958 adaptation of Stoker's famous novel is far and away the finest of several screen versions. <br /> <br />HORROR OF DRACULA has several points to commend it, all of which converge to make this a true masterpiece of horror cinema: First, Terence Fisher's strongly Christian mythological framework, rarely so brilliantly brought to the screen as it was here; second, Jack Asher's superbly atmospheric photography and lighting, bringing us the most memorable and carefully articulated images of vampirism of all time; third, Bernard Robinson's splendid sets; fourth, James Bernard's score, his most famous, complementing excellently Fisher's blend of fairy-tale, sexuality, horror and drama; fifth, Jimmy Sangster's intelligent script; and sixth, two sterling performances by relative newcomers to stardom, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. <br /> <br />This film has haunted me since I first watched it at the age of ten, and it still weaves a powerful spell. Later versions have tended, perhaps inevitably, to be highly derivative, where the Hammer version set the tone for a whole genre of films, putting its stamp irrevocably on the face of Dracula and its surrounding mythology for almost half a century to come.
B000022TSH|5.0|\\"Chinatown\\" was the signature achievement of Roman Ploanski's career before personal peccadilloes forced his flight from the United States.  From an Oscar-winning script by Robert Towne, Polanski crafts an excellent noir set in thirties Los Angeles that evokes the milieu of Chandler and Hammett and also some of the better film noir of the forties.  To give away the surprises of this film would be a big no-no.  Needless to say it involves a private detective hired for a routine snoop job and uncovers along the way a water diversion plot, a land grab, murder and other nasty business.  Jack Nicholson gives an effective performance here as detective Jake Gittes, simultaneous determined and befuddled in his attempts to uncover the truth.  Faye Dunaway is equally good as Evelyn Mulwray, the mysterious daughter of an industrialist who is central to Gittes investigation.  John Huston gives a towering performance in a supporting role as Noah Cross, the ruthless industrialist who is used to getting his way.  Director Polanski also has a cameo here as a knife-wielding punk who confronts Gittes at a reservoir.  You would think that a film of this stature would be given some decent extras on it's DVD issue, however, Paramount at the time used to pretty much release all of it's films as vanilla discs and charge $29.99 retail.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is by far the most telling documentary in recent years. The right-wing spin is exposed! It is clear that Bush is a moron and Moore clearly depicts that. There is no question that Bush is using Americans for his own right-wing agenda. Anybody who votes for Bush is a moron and has no clear sense of what is right and what is wrong...
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie was horrible, the 9/11 attacks should not be a political debate, but a reminder to us all that life is precious and that everyone has there own opinion, and writing a story attacking the person who has probably endured the most hardship as a president.

B000002HMH|3.0|I've been planning on reviewing this album for years now, and as I'm about to do it, it occurs to me why I've been putting it off: There just isn't that much to say about it.(provided you want to ignore the tedious sell-out debates, which I do)  It's got a few great tracks, a few good ones and a whole bunch that are alright, but not really worth your time.  This is especially sad, because, as many have suggested, they could've made a genuinely great album had they simply culled the best material from Load and Re-Load rather than just releasing it all.(Hell, I actually think Re-Load is a pretty great album by itself, though a few tracks definitely shoulda been cut) But this is what we got, so this is what I've gotta review.<br /><br />Many people have accused this album of being 'alternative' and this just doesn't make a whole lotta sense to me.  Simply put, I've listened to plenty of alternative radio in my day, and this just doesn't sound much like what you find there.  But it certainly isn't thrash or any sort of traditional metal either.  It's largely a sort mid-paced, groovy, vaguely southern hard rock/metal album.  This is particularly unfortunate, because it insists that all the songs be of a similar tempo while it de-emphasizes the riffs, thus making it a bit repetitious and bland much of the time.  Though the riffs have been severely blanded, I must say that I still really like Hammet's lead work.  It fits the material pretty well, and I, personally, really like the extensive use of the wah pedal.  This isn't his best work, but I still enjoy it a lot, and it really helps the album.  And I still really like Hetfield's voice.(Frankly, I think the vox are better here than on most of their classic albums, though that is largely due to their crapola porduction)<br /><br />Pretty much everything here sounds alright when your listening to it, and is frequently a bit catchy, but it hasn't much depth, for the most part, and this, combined with a lack of variety makes much of the album get pretty old after a while.  Still, it can work.  2x4 is fun and cathcy and grooves well enough, and I really like King Nothing, though it's enjoyable in pretty much the same way.  I would even say that King Nothing is a great song, for it's decidedly modest goals.  Cure is pretty good too. It's got nice atmosphere and a good riff, though it doesn't really do all that much.  That's 3 good songs in that basic style, but about half the album is like that, and the rest of it isn't terribly inspired.<br /><br />The other, more varied tracks are a mixed bag as well.  The 2 epics, Bleeding Me and The Outlaw Torn are both excellent.  They both have great solos and great vox, and a good heavy yet catchy and melodic main riff.  And Until it Sleeps if pretty good, though it lack any real depth.  But Hero of the Day is pretty much just a stylistic extension of that track, but with severely diminishing returns.(Though I rather like the ending of it)  The House that Jack built has a nice mood to it, but, once again, it fails to do anything terribly interesting.  Mama Said is interesting in that it is quite different from anything else Metallica has ever done, but not really interesting in and of itself.  Ronnie is one of the weirder pieces here, and I actually rather like it.  The twanging and shrieking riff they use if actually pretty fun, and it's just a nice groovy, catchy song.<br /><br />Well, I guess it's about times I scored things and wrapped it all up.  In the end, Load has 3 great tracks,  4 good tracks, and 7 ones, that while not particularly offensive to the ear, are not inspired or terribly interesting.  So that all adds up to a slightly generous 3 stars and Metallica's weakest album.lbum get pretty old after a while.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|This is an excellent Iron Maiden album, and one of the best albums of last year.  Overall I'd say it's probably my fourth favorite album from them, coming in behind Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind and Seventh Son...  In many ways it's quite different from prime era Maiden, as it tends to be a bit more epic and varied, but this is still a great album in it's own way.  It has got a little bit of filler, but it's not too bad, and the strong material more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Performances are strong across the board.  Dickinson doesn't sound quite as good as he did in his heyday, but he can still belt it out well, and they write good vocal melodies, as usual.  The guitars are excellent, combining lots of melody and catchiness with more heaviness than usual.(Particularly on Montsegur and Paschendale)  And it goes without saying that the leads never fail to entertain.  Harris' bass is a bit more subdued than it used to be, but it can still be heard quite well, and gives the album the energy and feel you typically associate with Iron Maiden.  Nicko's drumming doesn't draw too much attention to itself, but he does a good job, particularly on Face in the Sand and Paschendale.  Unlike many people, I think the production on this album is excellent.  I don't find it too muddy, and the guitars are thicker and heavier than usual, which is definitely a good thing.(It's far better than Brave New World in this aspect, which wasn't heavy enough)<br /><br />This is one of their most varied albums.  The title track is quite unusual, and one of the best songs on the album.  It probably has the best vocal performance on the album, and the acoustic work is great.  It's still strong when it kicks it up a bit in the second half, with some great leads and nice orchestration.  It's an 8 1/2 minute song where not a second is wasted.  Montsegur is perhaps the heaviest Iron Maiden song I've heard.  The chorus isn't too great, but it's the energy and intensity that really matter.  No More Lies is a fairly conventional epic semi-ballad, but it's still a great one.  Lotsa people find the chorus annoying, but I love it, and the vocal melodies during the verses are very strong.  Another modern classic.  Rainmaker is oddly happy sounding, but it still works and is the best straight metal song on the album.  The pre-chorus and chorus are both immediately memorable, and the guitarwork is extremely melodic and enjoyable through out it.  I'm not quite as big on Paschendale as I was when this album was first released, but it's still a remarkable epic.  The odd electronics and orchestration work very well, and it is nicely paced and constructed, building on a revisiting themes without becoming redundant or losing focus.  It's also got a particularly great instrumental section.  Face in the Sand is another odd one, but I like it a lot anyway.  It goes a bit overboard on the synths I think, but it's still quite atmospheric and affecting.  The vox are very intense too.  The closer, Journeyman, is an epic, acoustic ballad.  I didn't like it too much at first, but it's grown on me a lot.  Melody has always been Maiden's strength, and it's got plenty of it, and Dickinson gives yet another great performance.  The 4 tracks I haven't discussed do want warrant any particular discussion.  They aren't bad by any means, but not that great, and 1 or 2 of them(it doesn't much matter which ones) should probably have been cut to keep up the momentum.  But as I said, they're still far from bad.<br /><br />Well, that's it.  This is a great metal album from one of the genre's best.r.

B0002OERI0|4.0|Who'd have thought it? The same three cartoonish clowns that titled an album \\"Dookie\\" and sang about \\"Pinhead Gunpowder\\" may have the best album of 2004 on the table with \\"American Idiot.\\" Green Day suddenly abandons three minute two chord blasters and writes a play in 13 acts. Maybe they decided it was time to show upstart kiddy punkers like Blink, Sum or Avril exactly just how it's done.<br /><br />All right, I'll admit the \\"cartoonish clowns\\" comment might be over the top. After all, I believe the lyric \\"Do you have the time to listen to me whine about nothing and everything all at once\\" is one of the most brilliant opening lines to a 90's song. That was almost 15 years ago, and some maturity had to creep in somewhere. Politics would come into play as well, and the title track suddenly ditches the old backdrops of mental wards and tweaking binges to shout at the \\"subliminal mind-fk America.\\"<br /><br />As soon as that rant ends, we are thrown into the twin tales of \\"St Jimmy\\" aka \\"The Jesus Of Suburbia\\" and his battle with his dual personalities. There are plenty of the usual three chord havoc bangers here, but more sophisticated arrangements appear in \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" and the ballad \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams.\\" The suites of \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" are the best \\"Punk Opera\\" concept pieces since the mighty Husker Du roared forth with \\"Zen Arcade.\\" Like that classic album, Green Day are out to prove that there is more to the world of punk than the preconceived notions and spiky haircuts.<br /><br />For those still longing for \\"Kerplunk\\" etc, those albums are almost twenty years old. Get over yourselves, the band is grown both artistically and physically since then. They probably identify with the stuck in the past girlfriend who writes Jimmy (in \\"Letterbomb\\") \\"Where have all the bastards gone, where have all the riots gone\\" just before she walks out on him. For Green Day and Jimmy/Jesus, like the great lot of us, the mohawk cut disappeared when the bald spot became more prominent. But that doesn't mean the Green Day creative brain fell out along with hair. They haven't caved into recording an album of standards, and that is something to be thankful for. Add on that Green Day has managed to crank out an album as diverse and powerful as \\"American Idiot\\" without abandoning much of what made then originally great (and Billie Jo just seems to sing better with every album) is cause for celebration.<br /><br />Four and a half stars.when the bald spot became more prominent.

The sound is great, the picture quality is excellent, and you get tons of extras. <br /> <br />I'm a Star Wars fan, but not a diehard, so I can live with Lucas' changes- it's his movies afterall. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this DVD set does justice (finally) to the trilogy!  Go out and get them before they package (and sully it) this set with the prequels.  hehe. :)
B00003CXDG|4.0|Fans of the long running tv series which inspired the two movies remember how a TEAM of specialists pulled off some really nifty, indeed IMPOSSIBLE stunts.  It was fast paced, tight and featured some nice teamwork from their incredible cast.  In bringing this series to the big screen, director John Woo has demonstrated his command of action scenes.  No one does car wrecks like Woo!  Unfortunately, both movies have really been vehicles for Tom Cruise to do his thing, and the essence of teamwork is relegated to supporting players, this time John Polson and Ving Rhames.  How an audience is expected to believe Cruise's instant love for the lovely Thandie Newton is beyond me, but it's a movie contrivance.  As is all of this film.  Granted, it's fast-paced, dynamic camera work and Dougray Scott is a fine villain.  But it's empty, vague, and oftentimes confusing.  The use of masks is overdone and somewhat predictable.  But, who can deny the visceral appeal of this movie?  Anthony Hopkins' uncredited appearance makes for a nice addition, too.<br /><br />If they do an MI-3, how about giving Cruise a good team:  add Vin Diesel, Angelina Jolie, Hugh Jackman and Jack Black?  Who knows?

B0002Z0EYA|2.0|Forget the fact that Greek mythology holds that the war was actually started by the gods up on Mount Olympus; forget the fact that Achilles' immortality but for his tendon (where the term \\"Achilles tendon\\" comes from) goes pretty much unmentioned; and forget the fact that Achilles actually died before the conquest of Troy and there were plenty of other exciting Greek warriors anyway. The reinventing of history by Hollywood isn't anything new. However, just because the plotline of a movie is inaccurate doesn't mean it has to be poorly done.  <br />Essentially, the plotline is that son of the Trojan king and queen, Paris (Orlando Bloom), falls in love with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), king of Sparta's, pretty wife, Helen (Diane Kruger). When Paris decides to smuggle Helen into the Trojan ship, the Greeks are furious because the two sides have just signed some sort of treaty. Thus, all of the warriors of Greece, who once signed a pledge to defend Helen, the most beautiful lady of the land, if any harm should befall her, are sent into battle. The Greeks bring out the big guns, most notably, the great warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt, in case you weren't aware) who agrees to fight despite his mother's (Julie Christie) prophecy that if he goes to Troy he will die. What ensues is basically a combination of intense battle scenes (but you're spoiled if you have seen Lord of the Rings) and some heady romantic scenes (Brad Pitt is naked in the very first shot), but other than that the whole affair is very shallow. If you know anything about the Iliad (and I'm not a Classics major) you will be groaning. The characters are skin-deep and hopelessly predictable.  <br />Brad Pitt does all right as a buff warrior, but there is no real room for him to scope out his acting ability. You will not be able to help rolling your eyes as you watch him show his \\"softer side\\" and teach his young protg how to duel (and then of course experience the agonies of grief when he dies) as well as when hewoos Briseis, a captured temple virgin (Rose Byrne), and then defends her as Troy falls. However, if you are looking for the wild and crazy rogue who played Tyler Durden in \\"Fight Club\\" then this is not the movie for you. German model Diane Kruger was a very safe choice for Helen-a typical blonde blue-eyed maiden with very little affect or attitude. Basically no one with any spunk or charisma would be an appropriate choice for Helen, because she is more of an object of desire than an actual human being. She played her role (which required minimal acting ability) well enough. Orlando Bloom was well-cast in his role as a pretty, cowardly sissy who spends his time being tortured and love-stricken and posturing for the ladies. <br />Perhaps the worst aspect of this film was the screenplay! I have not encountered such terrible dialogue in a movie since \\"Titanic\\". Clich lines such as `I will love you in this world and the next' are everywhere. An exchange between Helen and Paris which basically consists of: \\"You shouldn't be here!\\" \\"That's what you said last night and the night before that, etc.\\" and then suddenly Helen's naked, caused the entire theater to burst out laughing! Actually the entire movie did! If the whole thing had been a spoof then it would have been fine, but as a serious movie, Troy did not deliver.

For some, we think of greats like Bob Dylan and hard rockers like Aerosmith, Metallica, and The Scorpions. Nevertheless, that all seems to be cliche', when it really comes down to Bruce Springsteen. His voice and his edge have made a dynamic impact for well beyond 30 years in the industry. He truly has been one of the very few icons that always remained true to the public, without the need to sell himself out like most corporate, manufactured artists there are today. Nevertheless, every time he is on stage, that is what makes him sell out.<br /><br />The Essential Bruce Springsteen, is a comprehensive glimpse into Bruce's career. The 3 CD set contains over 40 tracks that really go deep into the musical depths the boss made responsible. The songs go from his early records, Greetings From Asbury Park and Born To Run, all the way to the massive 9/11 acclaimed The Rising. The album does include some great standards from the boss including Rosalita, Hungry Heart, Glory Days, Nebraska, all the way to his current hits, the Oscar-winning Streets Of Philadelphia, Lonesome Day, and his live acclaim's from his 2000 reunion tour with The E Street Band. Such as the diverse and controversial American Skin (41 Shots), which reflected on the death of a immigrant man who was killed mistakenly by cops in New York City.<br /><br />The record does also have some disadvantages to this collection. The album does overlook some great Springsteen songs like, My Hometown, One Step Up from the soft-spoken Tunnel Of Love, I'm On Fire, Secret Garden from Jerry Mcguire, and Murder Incorporated from his 1995 Greatest Hits. They could've been added onto the bonus disc of leftover songs. Instead, the record has some lesser known songs to the mend such as The Ghost Of Tom Joad, and his Oscar- Nominated Dead Man Walkin', from the 1996 Sean Penn movie.<br /><br />All in all, not every hits collection is perfectional, but this one is similar to recent collections by Elton John, Lionel Richie, and Donna Summer, which also includes a bonus disc. Out of all the ones that work, The Essential Bruce Sprinsteen fairs well. While some may feel a little more interested in the 1995 Bruce Springsteen hits collection, this one is a bit more diverse from the legacy of the boss.<br /><br />Overall: B+r to recent collections by Elton John, Lionel Richie, and Donna Summer, which also includes a bonus disc. Out of all the ones that work, The Essential Bruce Sprinsteen fairs well. While some may feel a little more interested in the 1995 Bruce Springsteen hits collection, this one is a bit more diverse from the legacy of the boss.    Overall: B+
B0002OERI0|1.0|I'll start off with whatever good points there are about this album from a band that is still as juvenile as ever. First off, Green Day couldn't have timed this release better. It's an election year, so they're ready to cash in whatever's anti-_____ at the moment. Second, there are two good songs on the album. The first, \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" is has an indian beat to it, which Green Day will surely run into the ground for albums to come. The second good song is \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" but the constant use of the word \\"f*ck\\" ruins any sentimentality the music built up. Green Day really need to lay off the unesessary cussing... and especially the epithet-using, but I'll get to that in a second. And now, the not-so-good points. By the way, Bryan Adams, I hope you're reading this, because Green Day did quite a bit of \\"heavy lifting\\" from a certain song of yours that reminisces about the summer of '69. Listen to \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\". Now go get 'em, Bryan. As for whole album itself: it's nothing close to operatic. The album's all more of the same, unless you count the fact that Green Day have learned to use new epithets they've never used previously. Take, for instance, the stale title song. Sure, it covers no new ground, but it does showcase Billie's new talent: using derogatory slang for a certain sexual minority in the most athematic ways possible. Also, take a look at the lyrics \\"Holiday.\\" Green Day are making homophobia catchy, whether they mean to or not. Green Day claim they're using words like that to get peoples' attention, but they obviously aren't smart enough to realize how stupid they are for doing such a thing. I don't see how welcoming listeners to \\"kill all the f*gs that don't agree\\" is an invitation to get my attention and make me listen to the song, but then again, I'm a high school graduate, so I'm not familiar with how the mind of a 32 year-old man with an 8th grade education works. To everyone who is unaware of all the great musicians Green Day have lifted from, the band are inventors of innovative music. But to the rest of us, Green Day are just three guys who really need to to realize they can't accomplish anything without using someone else's hooks.
B000059XUO|5.0|I've loved this film since I was a teenager and I watched it again for the first time in awhile and I was yet again in awe of it. I love the ambience of this film; the dark and surreal Detroit where it rained all the time. Brandon Lee was amazing in his role as Eric Draven. He really captured his heartache and suffering well. There is one scene that always gets me and that's when Eric and Shelley meet up once more, after all that happened. It moves me so deeply.  <br /> <br />But over all, see this film!

B000056JYC|5.0|This 25th anniversary reissue of one of rock's most famous (and sadly sometimes derided) live albums returns some of the authenticity which was lost from the original album. Three more live tracks from the series of American concerts which gave rise to the `Comes alive' album are added, together with a live performance recorded in an American studio in the same year, 1975. The order of the songs is returned to that of the original shows, the sequence used on the original album having been dictated primarily by the constraints of LP-side timings. The new sequencing of the tracks is fine, and the concert seems to take on a new character as a result, with a more pronounced `unplugged' section in the middle. All the tracks have been remastered and some remixing done, and the recording again becomes a double album, since it no longer fits on to one CD. The packaging is superb, with very high quality archive concert photos, a new essay, and all the song lyrics - not that they exactly qualify as great poetry! <br /> <br />However, despite these changes the resulting album is not perhaps quite as good as it might have been. The remastering is a bit louder than the previous CD remaster, but not significantly different, and whatever remixing has been done is so subtle as to be virtually undetectable. I had hoped that by way of a change the rather intrusive audience noise (especially the scary bang in the middle of `Wind of change') might have been reduced a little in this version, but it remains as loud as before. The live studio take of `Day's dawning' is an interesting piece of history, but weak compared with the original version which opens the `Frampton' album. The three extra performances from the `Comes alive' concerts are all excellent and fill out the recording to approximately the correct length for Peter's concerts of the time. However, one can't help feeling that there must have been other songs in the band's repertoire which were performed in that summer of '75, and which could have been included here to fill out the double CD. They needn't have formed part of the `concert proper', but could have been added as a postscript, like the radio studio cut, in order to give a really comprehensive overview of the band's work at that time. Instead all we have essentially is the original live album with 3 extra performances - perhaps not enough to be trumpeted as a special anniversary edition. <br /> <br />To sum up though, despite these criticisms, this is an improved version of the previously available album, and it remains a classic which defined the sound of FM rock radio just prior to the `punk' onslaught. Unfairly criticized by some as just a pretty-faced poser, Frampton demonstrates that he can play melodic rock guitar far better than most, as well as putting on an exciting live show which the audience thoroughly enjoys. So if like me you considered `Comes alive' to be an indispensable 70s rock album, you will probably agree that this version is even better than the original. (By way of comparison, I would also recommend the 1999 `Live in Detroit' album by Frampton - be sure to get the extended, double CD version - which shows that though he has lost most of his hair and gained a little weight since the glory days of `75, Peter's guitar playing and live performance appeal remain intact.) <br />
B000002H97|5.0|Better than this doesn't metal get. This album is an influence for all small goth,black,thrash,death,and you name it, metal bands. Songs like Sad but True and Through the never are universally accepted as the best music ever produced. This album made metal so huge and helped the whole metal scene with ideas on how to write great and epic metal songs. Before this album metal was just a hobby but this album made metal a lifestyle. This album is the single most important event in metal history! <br />And if that wasn't enough seven years later comes another epic metal album from the masters of metal called RELOAD. The black album and RELOAD are a must have in every true metal heads collection. GET THEM NOW!!!!
B00004VW0V|3.0|For his fifth Island Records album after reinventing himself as a more poetic and philosophical singer-songwriter, Cat Stevens made some significant changes in his recording methods. Dispensing with Paul Samwell-Smith, who had produced his highly successful albums of recent years, he took on production duties himself, and went to Jamaica to record with a new group of seasoned session musicians (several from the USA) replacing most of the players from his previous albums. Perhaps Stevens considered that this new direction would give him a more `serious', less overtly commercial identity than his preceding albums, and if so the experiment probably achieved its objectives. However, it is notable that for his next album after `Foreigner', Samwell-Smith was back on board and the recording again largely returned to the more concise and accessible style of albums such as `Tea for the tillerman' and `Teaser and the firecat'. And although the new remastering compensates to some extent, the overall production sound of `Foreigner' lacks something of the polish and cohesiveness of the Samwell-Smith productions. <br /> <br />The first half of the album (the original LP side 1) is occupied by the 18 minute `Foreigner suite', which is one continuous musical piece essentially comprising variations on three undistinguished songs, with short musical interludes. The title `Foreigner' seems to have no relevance to the lyrical content of the suite, and the whole concept is in reality much more lightweight than its title and length suggest. However, it gives Stevens the opportunity to experiment with more meandering arrangements, incorporating strings, brass and various keyboards and synthesizers, than was possible within the confines of his previous shorter pop songs (of his earlier pieces, `18th avenue' from the `Catch bull at four' album, with its contrasting moods and extended instrumental section, probably comes closest to the style of the `Foreigner suite'). The suite is a bit of achallenge to listen to because of its length, but with repeated listening its appeal does grow and it probably contains just enough variety to keep a committed Cat fan interested. <br /> <br />If the second half of `Foreigner' had contrasted strongly with the lengthy Suite and contained more immediately appealing music, the album might have been counted as a complete success; however, the second half remains relatively undistinguished and uncommercial. The opening track `The hurt' is a pleasant, mid-tempo, sparsely arranged song in the classic Cat Stevens style, though based round the electric piano rather than acoustic guitars. Despite being a minor hit in summer 1973, this track has undeservedly always been omitted from Cat's compilation albums, and is in my opinion the best song on `Foreigner'. It is followed by `How many times', a painfully slow ballad with at times anguished vocals, which has a few appealing touches. But by this point any trace of what really made Stevens a hit artist at the start of the 70s has evaporated, and the closing two tracks are little more than uninspired `filler'.  <br /> <br />So whilst this album certainly marks a stylistic departure for Cat Stevens, and undoubtedly has some reasonable musical moments, it can't be regarded as one of his most memorable recordings. It is unfortunate to have to say that the beautiful colour photo of the beach on the back cover is one of the most appealing aspects of this album.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This DVD marks the 186th release of DOTD on home video. But seriously, it's THE one you cannot be without, a fan of the movie or not.<br /><br />George A. Romero's HUGE-scale sequel to Night of the Living Dead takes his simple, but scary, idea and expands from an isolated farmhouse to the whole planet. The zombies are EVERYWHERE and there is no escape. Resistance is futile. A couple of SWAT team members quickly figure this out and skip on their evacuation duties to just get out of the city in their own quicker way. Hooking up with a couple of traffic reporters in a chopper they take off in search of a safe haven. Along the way they see the world below react to the oncoming Armageddon and end of civilization.<br /><br />After spotting a deserted shopping mall below the quartet land on the roof and barricade themselves inside as the world very quickly crumbles. Hope is rapidly running out and much time passes with no word from what remains of the world.<br /><br />While not as scary as the remake, this film does make up by having a sick sense of humor and a larger story to tell. I won't pass off cheeky subtext as my own discovery (every other review here does) but it is quite intelligent (if a bit dated in the present day). There's a lot of depth to Dawn of the Dead and it's all well thought out and planned rather than being generic and unoriginal like so many other modern horror movies.<br /><br />There characters (especially Ken Foree) are all strong and believable and react with logic and sense rather than annoying panic. It's interesting to see how normal people take on facing the end of civilization (if not the end of the world...just humans) with just simple tools and the bare minimum at their reach.<br /><br />The opinions over the original and remake are pretty much split. I think that both are very strong efforts at true horror and instead of regarding them as original/remake I think it's wiser to consider them as two separate stories both happening at the same time.<br /><br />Each film has their weaknesses and strengths. The zombies in the original are a bit too comical to be truly threatening. While in the remake they'd be on you, ripping your throat out before you can even say 'What the..?' And the actual 'DAWN' of the dead was more emphasized in the remake. Though the original has more of a true epic feel to it.<br /><br />This release features 3 different versions of the film. The 126 minute American cut, the 117 minute European Cut and the Extended 139 minute version. The German 156 cut does not get a mention. Extra features are plentiful and, for once, they're for a film where extras make sense, not the fluff we get usually. Two big documentaries 'The Dead Will Walk' and 'Document of the Dead' are included as well as loads of commentaries, interviews, clips, trailers etc. Even a mini version of the first issue of the DOTD comic book. The American and European versions are Divimax which means an excellent 1.85:1 anamorphic picture and Dolby 6.1/DTS sound. The extended cut is plain old anamorphic and Mono.<br /><br />This is definitely a horror classic, far above Psycho and Silence of the Lambs. True greatness and not only an important film but a true labor of love. Everyone involved made it because they love the genre and were not just trying to pay this weeks rent cheque. An important element missing from 99.99% of horror films made these days. Keep a lookout for Jason make-up man Tom Savini (who is always the highlight of any movie) as Blade an remember Ken Foree's chilling prophecy...'When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth'at the same time. <br /> <br />Each film has their weaknesses and strengths.

B000058TDY|3.0|Cat Stevens' last album of his musical career, issued at the end of 1978, has a beautiful cover with a colour photograph of a waterfall in a lush woodland setting. The picture exudes freshness; sadly, however, this cannot be said of the music within, which generally seems tired and uninspired. It retreads musical and lyrical ideas which are mostly familiar from previous Cat albums, says nothing new and includes no particularly memorable songs. It is well played, pleasantly arranged and very forgettable. The songs could all easily be based on ideas rejected from earlier albums like Buddha and Izitso, and lack inspired melodic hooks. As on the previous album Izitso there are two instrumentals (a sign of waning songwriting inspiration?) and although of these the gentle, orchestrated The Artist initially sounds promising, it doesn't develop much musically and quickly goes out with a whimper. Although Cat's records were often not particularly long, this one extends to only 34 minutes, and reinforces the sense that Stevens wasn't really trying, but was just fulfilling his contract by delivering one last album. At the time it was issued, the general public were not aware that this would be the last pop album that Cat Stevens would make, but with the benefit of hindsight, knowing that he soon after gave up his musical career, one can't help feeling that his heart was no longer in it. Committed fans of Cat Stevens will be glad to have this album, as the last work of a much loved songwriter who stopped recording and moved on to other things, but it is a pale shadow of the work he did in his prime.
B000002IOY|5.0|There is really no other band in the thrash metal sub genre that is more consistent than Overkill. These guys are truly one of the greatest thrash metal bands ever, who have consistently stayed true to their roots and to themselves throughout the years. They are truly a one of a kind band, no questions asked. Their fourth album from 1989 &#34;The Years of Decay&#34; is the best album that they've released in the 80's, but also in my opinion the best album of theirs by far. This album is just punishingly heavy throughout and also features some of the best and most heaviest songs to be ever written and produced. There also happens to be a great deal of variety on this album as well, for instance you've got songs on here that are blazing fast, some mid paced, and yes even a few slower-Black Sabbath-influenced tunes, and also lots of tempo changes, complex structures, and epic elements are also featured on here. It all just blends perfectly well on this album here. Another thing I'd like to point out is the overall production here which was handled by Terry Date (Pantera, White Zombie, Soundgarden, Deftones) is very heavy and all around amazing throughout. Bobby &#34;Blitz&#34; Ellsworth leads the charge just like he always does, as he is in absolute fine form here with his insanely unique, fierce, and aggressive vocal delivery which is displayed excellently through each track. The rest of the band's musicianship is also definitely worth the mention as well as guitarist Bobby Gustafson just shreds like nobody else's business, blasting out heavily, bone crunching, thrashy riffs and plenty of insane, speaker shredding solos. He really steals the show on this album, and sadly this would be the last album by Overkill to feature Gustafson on guitar. Elsewhere, you also have D.D. Verni who is truly one of the best bass players in metal, as he also does a super awesome job with his heavy, ear ringing bass work throughout, and of course drummer Sid Falck does an excellent job behind the kit, as he can play from super fast to bone crushingly slow.<br /><br />The opening cut &#34;Time to Kill&#34; is among the album's many epic highlights here that begins with a slow yet powerful intro that slowly builds and leads into a punishing onslaught of fast, chugging riffage, and bouncy, energetic drum beats, and aggressive vocals, and then later midway, the song shifts into a slower, yet very sludgy and crunchy riff section, and then picks the speed back up afterwards, and we're also treated with an awesome eargasmic outro that'll make you saw &#34;WOW&#34;. Then we have &#34;Elimination&#34; which is not only my favorite track on the whole album, but it's also my favorite Overkill song ever as well. This song is definitely a pure thrash classic. It just has tons of energy throughout with fast, bouncy drum work, backed by crunchy hot, thrashing riffs, and pulse pounding bass work, and plenty of wild, shredding guitar solos including one midway through that features some great melodic touches as well, plus you also got Blitz's always fierce and aggressive vocal delivery, and an extremely catchy as hell chorus which is one of absolute best and most catchiest choruses in any Overkill song or any thrash metal song for that matter. It's just awesome. Track three &#34;I Hate&#34; is also another huge favorite of mine here, and boy if there ever was a song that I want to crank up real loud whenever I'm pissed, then this song is definitely it. Blitz's vocals throughout this song are very fierce and ferocious throughout especially during the chorus, and the song also features more excellent crunching, grinding thrashy riffs, and ear ringing bass lines, and pounding drums, plus another screaming, shredding Gustafson solo is also thrown in as well. Moving on, track four &#34;Nothing to Die For&#34; is also another brutal, in your face thrasher that borderlines on yet more brutal, pounding percussion work, plus more of Gustafson's amazing riffing and pummelingbass lines from Verni including a funky, cool slap bass solo at 2:19 which is quickly followed by yet another wicked guitar solo from Gustafson aided by some machine gun double bass kicks afterwards. Then after four energetic headbaging tunes, the album slows things down with the epic 10 minute plus slow, sludging Black Sabbath-esque behemoth &#34;Playing With Spiders/Skullkrusher&#34; which is heavily dominated by a dirge of heavy, crunching downtuned riffs that are powerful enough to smash some glass, however the song does pick up some speed near the 5 minute mark midway and then slows back down again at 7:23 for the rest of the way.<br /><br />Moving onwards, track six &#34;Birth of Tension&#34; is another powerful headbanger that brings the album back intro thrash assault mode with a barrage of pounding, energetic beats, and meaty, bone grinding, thrashing riffage, plus a great chorus with some ripping double bass drum assaults backing it up, and some more killer Gustafson soloing intact as well. Track seven &#34;Who Tends the Fire&#34; is another powerful epic that features some very dark and ominous yet clean acoustic passages especially in the beginning that slowly leads up into a steady yet pummeling assault of heavy hitting, rhythmic, electric riff chugs that are hard enough to pound you straight to the ground, and Blitz also delivers an eerie yet very powerful and melodic vocal performance on here. Then just at 4:23, the song picks up speed and energy, only to slow things down around 5:33, and then again picking up speed near the end with some more great Gustafson soloing included. Next up, we have the title track &#34;The Years of Decay&#34; which is an epic 8 minute ballad that features some great, splendid acoustic plucking and great melodic sung vocals from Blitz until things get a bit heavier around the 3 minute mark with hot, pumping, electric riffage and earth shaking bass lines and drum beats, plus some more awesome, melodic soloing is also included, and we also have an epic sing along section that concludes this epic masterpiece of a song. The album finally concludes with the blistering closer &#34;E.vil N.ever D.ies&#34; (which of course is another one of my favorite Overkill songs) and what a blistering way to conclude an epic thrash classic of an album. The song starts off almost reminiscent of Metallica's &#34;Damage Inc.&#34;, and then before you even know it, the song kicks right into a blistering, breakneck assault of adrenalized, thrashing riffage and mad, frenzied soloing, and pummeling drum work, and ferocious vocals, and an excellent chorus. On an added note, this song also features a very addicting vocal section around the 4 minute mark that you just can't resist singing or screaming along to.<br /><br />All in all, this is an absolutely incredible album, and it is truly one of the best thrash metal albums to come out of the 80's as well. If you consider yourself a fan of thrash metal, but have never listened to &#34;The Years of Decay&#34; yet, then you in all seriousness are indeed missing out on one incredible masterpiece of thrash right here. I seriously recommend checking out this album along with Overkill's other albums as well. Trust me, this is an album that is worth every penny you spend...HORNS UP!!!<br /><br />\m/s from Verni including a funky, cool slap bass solo at 2:19 which is quickly followed by yet another wicked guitar solo from Gustafson aided by some machine gun double bass kicks afterwards.

B00003CY6M|5.0|I've watched a lot of movies billed as Romantic Comedy over the years,but found relatively few of them to be romantic and even fewer to be funny.  \\"Serendipity\\" is one of the exceptions, succeeding very well as a comedy and succeeding with all the brilliance of the sun as a beautiful, sensuous, fairy-tale romance.  A chance meeting, enchatment at first sight, a chance on fate, a twist of bad luck followed by love's refusal to drift off into the sunset despite all odds and all rationality add up to a spellbinding movie that, all by itself, makes up for every single romantic comedy that's tried to be this good and fell far short.  Starring the beautiful Kate Beckinsale (in probably the best performance of her accomplished career) and John Cusack, with a small but brilliant role played to perfection by Eugene Levy.
B0002VC924|5.0|I've seen and read a lot of Moore's stuff. At times I find him to be a champion for justice, and other times little more than an alarmist, and a self-serving one at that (just watch some Awful Truth episodes and you'll see this duality). However, he hit a homerun with this film. <br /> (...) I find myself more interested in US politics than those of my country, Canada. So much more seems at stake with this election, because of the huge influence of the USA on the rest of the world (whether we like it or not). This amazing film is obviously anti-Bush, but hard for critics to refute. After all, Moore uses images and video that speak truths the Bush government can't dodge. The film is amazing, fun, eye-opening and astonishing in it's portrayal of Bush as a... do I need to list it all? <br />I was amazed when I saw this film in the theatre. People actually applauded at the end. You will too. Let's hope there are no more years for Dubya.
B00005JL96|5.0|Easily one of the most rip-roaring hilarious movies ever made, \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" should be stocked in the Comedy section of videostores as well as the Family section.  Effortlessly mixing cute appeal, hilarity, tenderness, and All-Ages High Adventure that's actually reminiscent of \\"Back To The Future\\" and \\"The Rocketeer\\", this tale of bio-engineered alien 'experiment' Stitch, his chaotic escape to Earth, and his teaming up with fellow title character Lilo (an adorable little Hawaiian girl who instantly marks her niche as an alternately curious/perky and grumpy/stubborn little mischief-maker), her big sister and the guy pining away for the big sister, \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" stands proudly both with eternal Disney classics like \\"Dumbo\\" and \\"Bambi\\", and with the top-notch animation from Asia like \\"Spirited Away\\" and \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" - an alltime great!
B00005ASHM|5.0|Unless you're an avid reader of Rolling Stone's retrospective issues, you could easily forget that the Beach Boys were once a great band comparable to the Beatles and that Brian Wilson was considered a musical genius. Certainly the copious notes included in the CD booklet here will vouch for that viewpoint. With Wilson finally completing his legendary \\"Smile\\" recording after a 37-year break, interest in the band's recognizable music will likely cause an upswing in sales, especially for this album, long considered the masterpiece of their lengthy career. Inspired by the Beatles' \\"Rubber Soul\\", Wilson wanted to make an album that thematically integrated love and even inspirational songs together. He succeeded.<br /><br />With their soaring, yearning harmonies and sunny California dispositions intact, \\"Pet Sounds\\" is still great and made all the more resonant by its sophisticated instrumental arrangements and Wilson's creative musical invention. Songs like \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"God Only Knows\\", \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\\" and \\"Caroline No\\" remain classics that go far beyond the aging Gidget set and showcase their amazing abilities as a vocal group. The title track and the especially esoteric \\"Lets Go Away for Awhile\\" unearth Wilson's talent for multi-tracking and embracing different musical styles without sacrificing the sound that was essentially the band's own. This CD contains a bonus track, \\"Hang On To Your Ego\\", which is actually an alternate take of \\"I Know There's an Answer\\", and for die-hard fans, the whole album is repeated in stereo. I still prefer the original mono recordings as they have the pop and crackle that captures a more innocent time in recording, a nostalgic postcard for a band that once had the potential to supplant the Fab Four in creative output. Whereas the Beatles retired amid inner turmoil at the height of their popularity thus assuring their legacy, the Beach Boys languished into a parody of themselves as Wilson was facing demons of his own. But at least there is this one album to treasure.wn. But at least there is this one album to treasure.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|One of their best. I have all their studio cd's including several live discs from their web site. Have been my favorite band for twenty years. There is not a bad song on this disc. The two disc set is a must if your a Marillion fan. Fantatic Place and Neverland are my favorite tracks. Tonight I will see just how good they are live.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I have been looking forward to these dvds for a long time.  I actually haven't seen these movies in years, as I knew that they would hit DVD eventually, and I'd never seen them in widescreen before.  I would have been satisfied with the original cuts, but am not disappointed with the special editions.  For the most part, the added effects look great, and provide a better transition into the new trilogy.   <br /> <br />What really disappoints me is the disc for Epsidode IV: A New Hope.  This disc is a disaster.  In some scenes, the dialog is drowned out and 'dirty' sounding, while in other scenes, it sounds very crisp and clear.  That alone wouldn't be so bad, but there are plenty of visual glitches in my copy as well.  In the second half of the film, there are many digital skips and artifacts popping up.  It looks like the disc is ready to start skipping at any minute, and then, at one point, the movie freezes for several seconds and skips ahead a few minutes into the film!  I looked at several messageboards and it appears that it is not just my disc.  Apparently, it's a known problem in the pressing of the discs that is only evident in certain dvd players.  I trust that LucasFilm was unwarare of this problem when shipping the product, and that they will make replacement discs available.   <br /> <br />I don't know if anyone from the studio is reading this, but with the many many people chiming in every day to complain about the things we DO know were done intentionally, I wouldn't blame lucasfilm for staying as far away from these reviews as possible.  Shame, really.  I just want what I paid for to work properly.   <br /> <br />The disc for Empire played flawlessly, and still stands out as the best looking of the trilogy, but the Jedi disc had a few odd video glitches, and also froze at one point.  Taking the disc out and putting it back in allowed me to resume the film and view the rest without any problems, however.. so I don't know if it is related to the problem with the 'A New Hope' disc. <br /> <br />I trust these problems are not going to be ignored, and that we will have replacement discs available soon.  If not for these terribly distracting glitches, the set would easily get a 5 star rating, as the movies look and sound fantastic, and despite the problems, they managed to fill me with the joy and giddiness that I felt watching these films as a child. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Best TV show I have ever seen and I am 63 years old. But these reviews from America are so earnest and sincere. Lighten up, Fans; it is only a TV show, not a religion. Or is Firefly the opiate of the masses? By watching our Firefly DVDs over and over again, we fans escape our pathetic lives enslaved to our jobs and fears. We can only dream of the camaraderie, freedom, and courage of the Serenity crew. I have a lot of time in jail to watch Firefly. I dream of freedom. And I can sing all the words to \\"The Ballad of Jayne.\\" <br /> <br />When humanity left Earth, it left behind its 'shiny' ethics and took its corroded antiques: a ruling class, fascism, religious fanaticism, slavery, piracy, torture, cannibalism! It is a corrupt Capitalist Universe. The Core worlds of the Alliance are rich and the exploited colonies are poor. Captain Mal has the brains to keep flying and trading between the planets and not become a victim. And he has the guns, lots of guns. The firefly crew and passengers know how to use guns. The firefly people can shoot, charm, or trade with anyone except those damn cannibals, who want meat, not money. These angelic-looking firefly people are \\"killer angels\\" killing the bad guys. Each one is smart and charming in their own way, even that thug Jayne Cobb. What a jerk-off, Jayne is! Zo and Mal are fighting a part-time guerrilla war against the Alliance. Both want revenge, Mal even more than Zo. He hates the Alliance more than I hate the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal. To spite the Alliance, Mal will go to enormous trouble to keep crazy Miss River Tam out of Alliance prison.  Mal, rescue me from prison! I want out so I can see your movie \\"Serenity\\" in 2005. <br /> <br />Why do the outer worlds live in the 19th century and the Core worlds live in the 26th century?  Karl Marx explained that when government does not regulate Capitalists, they will always use their power to impoverish the workers. If there is no stortage of workers, wages will fall to the subsistence level, barely enough to keep a worker alive. Automobiles, good food, and indoor plumbing are luxuries that most workers on the outer worlds can not afford. A Pure Capitalist like Fox Network owner Rupert Murdock is without mercy toward workers; he is a Reaver without the cannibalism. Firefly was cancelled because it was a devastating critique of Murdock's Pure Capitalism. The evil executives at FOX Network are NOT idiots; Murdock would have fired the executives unless they canceled Firefly. Oh, and Kaylee looks Serbian to me. She is perfectly ripe fruit. She is hot. Hot! _HOT!!_  It is good to dream that Serbian women will go to the stars. Keep flying everyone and sing-a-long:  <br />... Take my love, take my land  <br />Take me where I cannot stand <br />I don't care, I'm still free  <br />You can't take the sky from me ...  <br /> <br />Slobodan Milosevic, The Hague, Netherlands
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album was a long time in the making, and it shows. While this acclaimed \\"rock opera\\" may or may not stand the test of time passed by Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" or The Who's \\"Tommy\\", it stands in refreshing contrast to most of the other current albums on the market. Also, don't believe the hype about this album being anti-american. Those who claim such nonsense have obviously missed the point.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|It doesn't really make sense to criticize someone for being consistently good.  So that means I'm really picking nits by giving this 4 stars, when 4.5 is more like it (no options here for that!).  Mr. Knopfler's quality is so good that the brilliance and aptitude on display deceived me at first into thinking it was way too easy. <br /> <br />In fact, you could simply put the CD player on random and hit a winning cut. I especially like the title track, \\"Donegan's Gone,\\" and \\"Back To Tupelo,\\" the later two being tributes to seminal and great rockers from the earliest days. <br /> <br />It's particularly good news that Mr. Knopfler's hand has recovered from the break in the auto accident a couple of years ago.  Let's all hope for a tour to support this CD and another release without having to wait so long.
B000002LMK|5.0|The first few times I popped this CD into my player, I just grinned from ear to ear.  Neil Young is best when he is angry and channeling that anger into something strange and joyful with sparse lyrics and crunchy guitar.  And that's what's happening on this album.  The best Neil Young album since the late 1960s, and much more raucous and fun than Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.  There is just an emotional strength to this album that gives it staying power.  Add Crazy Horse to the mix, and you definitely have something where the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts.  This CD is a primer on how to make smart, emotional rock and roll.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I kid you not. Sum up all the rave reviews and instead of going agog with disbelief, try to imagine that the concert is still more than all they say, even if you only get to experience it on DVD. Then go get it and see for yourself how you get high on George. Ok, I have one negative comment, it's about 6 dvd's and 12 hours too short. How's that?
B0000844M8|5.0|Without bombs, bullet, swear words, light sabers, bathroom humor, or any special effects, this managed to hold a wide age range group's attention. Other reviewers have commented a lot about the VHS movie, so let me confine my remarks to the DVD. <br /> <br />Actually, as DVDs go, this is not so great. The movie makes you very curious about a lot of things: how in the heck did they train the animals to make all their moves for the camera? how true to life is the story? and so on. The DVD, by virtue of totally lacking extras, utterly fails to answer any of those questions. The picture has that of-an-era very colorful and yet simultaneously slightly washed out look that begs, nay screams, for some kind of color correction. And the sound clearly has effects of tape compression or something; it is not very open (I listened in stereo, and don't know if there is a 5.1 track). <br /> <br />If you're looking for a reference DVD with gorgeous cinematography of African scenes, this isn't it (due to the color imbalance)l. I give it 5 stars anyway simply because the movie is so well made.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|I bought this DVD to see the greatest performers of any era at one event. Every match was avearage to great. With the Main Event living up to all the hype, it was great to see Benoit get the big win over Cripple H and Shawn Michaels. Finally a guy who deserves the belt wins. Christian/Jericho was pretty good too. Victoria/Molly put on a excellent effort. Goldberg vs Lesner? HAHAHAHA!! What a joke. Lesner SUCKS and Goldberg? I could care less. <br /> <br />Angle and Eddie put on a masterpiece even though Angle was limited. Great match with a ingenius ending by Eddie. Undertaker returning was a highlight. But the biggest highlight was Rock and Flair in the same ring at WM. The greatest Sports Entertainer of ALL time against a guy many think is the greatest \\"wrestler\\" of all time. In the end, the Rock's charisma carried the match. Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
6305807930|5.0|When I read the other reviews for Inferno, I was lead to believe that it would be a hard to understand, but stylish, mess. I have heard the term \\"style over substance\\" so many times in reference to Argento's films that it has become a cliche'. Inferno is one of Dario's most bizzare and unconventional narratives, but it is not incoherent. A good horror film should always be aloof or ambiguos (take Kubrick's \\"The Shinning\\"). Horror becomes cheesy if over-explained. The scene in Suspiria when the dog rips out the blind guys throat would not have been as effective if we knew exactly why it happened, this is the difference between a great horror film and your average episode of \\"Charmed\\". <br />I personally found Inferno very unnerving and creepy. I won't spoil the plot, but in the first scene in the cellar, I sat bolt upright in anticipation. <br />Technically speaking, Argento is at his stylish best on this one. The lighting is great (even thought the saturated red/blue does get a little over used), the building and set pieces used were fabulous and (much to my surprise) I really enjoyed Keith Emerson's score.
B00003CXCT|5.0|We've been waiting for this for years. Who cares about the alterations? I got news for you, every movie is altered slightly when it is released on video! And the changes make the movies more enjoyable, and help unify both trilogies. I only hope that they make episodes VII, VIII, and IX.
B00006399Z|4.0|This is just a fun CD, and would nicely compliment your Traffic CD collection.  It captures the best of both mutations of Traffic; the days with Dave Mason, and the new expanded line-up featuring a very talented Rebop on congas, and super-drummer Jim Gordon and Blind Faith alum Rick Grech on bass.  The cast for this gig was quite impressive, and the playing is very tight and playful.   <br /> <br />I have always found Dave Mason's involvement with Traffic to be curious.  It reminds me of George Harrison with the Beatles: a talented, yet non-collaborative songwriter.   This album is right in line with the two previous Traffic studio albums on which he appears, featuring his token two or three song offerings; songs that are distinctly different from the rest of the tracks.  In this case, he features two lovely tunes from his debut solo album.   It is a shame he does not appear on more Traffic albums, because his guitar-playing and vocals are a perfect fit with Winwood's music.  He obviously had aspirations that were too big for simply being a member of a band, and I am sure he and Steve fought for creative control of the group.   That being said, the product here is a nice \\"goodbye\\" to the Traffic of old and a big \\"hello!\\" to the new and platinum-selling group, right on the brink of releasing their radio-friendly classic, \\"Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys\\".   Again, the group is amazingly tight, playful, and played a catchy jam version of \\"Gimme Some Lovin\\" that will make you wish you saw it in concert, and \\"Medicated Goo\\" is a brilliant song that will make you turn up the volume in your car. <br /> <br />HOWEVER, this disc does have its flaws.  First of all, it made me yearn for more material.  I mean, when this concert took place they were only a year or so removed from recording their modern classic, \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\", yet none of these songs were including in this release.  Secondly, I am a bit disappointed that in the age of 80-minute CD \\"bonus track\\" re-releases that no other tracks were discovered in the vaults for  this re-issue.  There must have been several more songs recorded that night or sometime on the tour, and why not even one bonus track was added to this disc befuddles me, and nowhere in the liner notes does it explain why.  I read somewhere that back in 1970 a totally different live album was to be released but was scrapped by Island Records.  Island Records, if you are reading this review, I would encourage you to release a 2 or 3-cd set of a complete Traffic concert (or two) from the this time period, much like the Dead are now doing with the \\"Dick's Picks\\" series, or like the Derek and the Domino's \\"Live at the Fillmore\\" 2-cd set.  Traffic fans deserve it.  And one more thing, if Steve Winwood or Jim Capaldi are reading this, please encourage either yourselves or a biographer to write your story.  I have yet to see a definitive book on Traffic.   I know it would be an interesting story and the time is right to for it to be told.  It is a story worth telling. cheers-Robert  Taylor, Charlotte, NC <br />
B000002JOH|5.0|I first picked this up when i was new to metal. It totally blew my head off!  There is nothing more to say! Its right up there with Reign in Blood and Master of Puppets!
B0001RVTXO|5.0|Well I have to say I've been waiting for this to come out for a while. Then I finally got to see them live but thats a whole other story. Basically this comp takes 23 of the their best songs and puts them on one cd. Its nothing fancy but there are some great songs here. If you like the Pixies then its a must. If you're into the Radiohead/Nirvana/post-rock/punky sounding stuff then check this out because chances are you might like it. These guys along with Jane's Addiction are the most influencial bands of the late 80's early 90's you owe it to yourself to chek them out. If you don't get this (which is highly recommended) then check out Surfer Rosa.
B000002UCN|4.0|I couldn't agree more with reviewers who believe that this album (here on CD, obviously) is simply too heavy on George's work as a member of The Beatles. Where is more of his solo work? Where is some great B side tunes? They're simply not here and it would be a great time to release a more affordable version of George's best since \\"Dark Horse\\" is wonderfully extensive but too expensive for many people. This 1976 album is truly overdue for an update!<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some real plusses to this CD. First, it is a great introduction to George Harrison's work. He did not get enough attention as a member of The Beatles. The CD starts out strong with a perpetual favorite, \\"Something.\\" There are several songs which demonstrate his work with The Beatles: \\"Taxman\\" and the hauntingly beautiful \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" are included. There is the beautiful \\"Give Me Love,\\" an incredible song that resonates the desire for love and total harmony--something we can all relate to. The album then ends with \\"Dark Horse\\" and \\"What is Life.\\" And, after all, it is affordable, which is never bad!<br /><br />Although there are no lyrics provided, the song credits are there along with some nice black and white photos of Harrison. The cover photo of George with the yellow car is great! The sound quality is excellent, too.<br /><br />I would recommend this for people getting to know George. It also has \\"Bangla Desh.\\" I also hope that there can be an affordable and complete anthology of this great man's work in the very near future.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Let's put aside for a moment the fact that these blu-rays are made from 7-year-old DVD masters (deja vu?) that were plagued with problems to begin with (some problems have been fixed for the blu-rays, others not, some problems have been made worse....)    How sad that George Lucas has not followed in the generous spirit of his buddies Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott, who thanked their fans for their support by releasing blu-ray sets of Close Encounters and Blade Runner, in MULTIPLE VERSIONS to allow their fans to choose which version they'd like to watch. They know, obviously, which side of their bread is buttered on, something they could teach a thing or two about to their friend, Mr. Lucas.    Lucas still digs his heels in with CGI and audio alterations to the classic trilogy, in spite of the outcry, and then adds some more alterations for good measure. Does he do that to annoy his fans? Why would someone want to annoy a group of people who have been financing you for over 30 years? Beats me. But my bank is now closed to you, Mr. Lucas, so don't come knocking again unless it's with newly-mastered blu-rays of the ORIGINAL '77-'83 trilogy.     Fool me once, shame on you.....(you know the rest).
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin's Chariot Stripped CD is fresh, sexy and from the heart! After watching him on VH1 in concert, I thought to myself, wow, who is that guy? listen to that positive energy! After listening to his CD several times, I love his upbeat piano style, along with his clever lyrics - especially in \\"Follow Through\\" and \\"Nice to Meet You Anyway.\\" Gavin has a Confidence Sex Appeal that naturally draws you to tune in  (just like attracting listeners, I also discuss how to build your Confidence Sex Appeal in my dating book, SMART Man Hunting, to attract the right mate). What a great surprise to discover Gavin DeGraw! I highly recommend that you check out this Chariot Stripped CD.
0778320448|4.0|The Shop on Blossom Street chronicles the lives of four very different women at different stages in their lives. Lydia Hoffman has survived bouts with cancer twice. Her recently deceased father was her inspiration for opening her yarn store in Seattle. Her sister Margaret does not provide much support for her at the beginning but they come to realize how important they are to one another. Lydia nervously discovers again how it feels to be in love for the first time in a long time. Carol and her husband Doug are trying earnestly to have a baby.

The Shop on Blossom Street provides a predictable story of hope and love that we all need.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is one of the best cds I've heard in quite a while. It hasn't left my usual rotation since it came out. (For those reading to get an idea of what is constantly in my rotation: Marley - Kaya, Jane's Addiction - Nothing's Shocking, Pink Floyd - Animals, Clash - London Calling, Pixes - Surfer Rosa, My Bloody Valentine - Isn't Anything) <br /> <br />This album is really really good but it isn't as \\"revolutionary\\" as people make it out to be. Bands like King Crimson were doing this stuff long before The Mars Volta. But I can say that \\"Deloused\\" is another cd into that area of music. Its not for everyone mainly because of Cedric's voice. I personally like it and the falsetto is good but I can see how it could annoy some people. So as long as his voice doesn't annoy you and you're into prog type music (its not true prog rock) then you will like this cd. If you come into this looking for At The Drive In type music then just get all the ATDI albums. This is nothing like ATDI and gets unfairly knocked because of that. Just because people were/are in another band doesn't mean the new band is going to sound like the other band. What would be the point of starting a new band if they were just going to keep playing the same stuff??? Thanks for reading, hope it helped.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins star as childhood pals in a working-class Boston neighborhood.  They seem to be typical boys, until one of the youngsters experiences a horrifying event that changes all of them forever.  The boys take three very different roads through life and are reunited 25 years later when Penn's 19-year-old daughter is murdered.<br /><br />\\"Mystic River\\" features an all-star cast that brings a great detail and grit to the film.  Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively.  Marcia Gay Harden was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and she's quite good as Robbin's uncertain wife.  Also adding greatly is the first-rate, Oscar nominated script - an adaptation by Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential) of the novel by Dennis Lehane - which manages to rein in what could easily be melodramatic schlock.  In particular, the two scenes involving a final confrontation and the solution to the murder are almost unbearably tense.  This 15-section alone makes \\"Mystic River\\" worthwhile.  Overall, \\"Mystic River\\" is a solid drama, although it does have a few debits.<br /><br />Specifically, for audiences raised on weekly episodes of \\"Law and Order\\" and \\"CSI,\\" the murder mystery is nothing spectacular; fortunately, the human drama carries the movie through weak spots.  Also, the movie attempts to play up the theme of fate and luck - i.e., if one of the other boys had been traumatized instead, what would have been the results?  Unfortunately, this idea is never fully formed and ends up seemingly tacked on for an attempt at depth.  Finally, the final five minutes are rather incongruous and end up undermining the movie.  Despite these weaknesses, \\"Mystic River\\" is a fine film that is likely to enthrall fans of quality, adult dramas.<br /><br />DVD Extras: The basic widescreen and fullscreen versions include no extras.  You have to purchase the much more expensive 3-disk edition to get any extras.<br />
B00009W0U4|3.0|The most controversial film of the 21st Century until \\"The Passion\\" came along, \\"Irreversible\\" is a film that was intended to offend, shock, and mortify audiences, yet still has some redeeming qualities.  Notably, the backwards structure gives the film more poignancy.  Despite what people may think of Gaspar Noe's purpose in making this film, what happens to the couple is truly tragic. <br /> <br />If you don't know by now, \\"Irreversible\\" is the story of one disatrous night in the lives of Alex (played by the luscious Monica Bellucci) and Marcus (Monica's real life husband, Vincent Cassel).  The movie begins with its own resolution and then moves the the climax of a violent rampage carried out by Marcus after Alex is brutally raped.  The former is a nauseating scene, in part because the camera is spinning out of control, that takes place inside an S&M club The scene is full of pornographic imagery and ends with a gruesome fight involving a fire extinguisher and somebody's face.  This combined with dialogue that sounds like prison vernacular times Penthouse Forum, only helped to add to the controversy surrounding the film and the number of people to walk out of theaters.  The rape scene takes place approximately in the middle of the film and lasts for ten minutes or more.  It is easily one of the most vicious scenes in film history; not for the faint of heart.  Apparently, the director wanted to try  top \\"Salo\\"--known in film circles as the most disgusting film of all-time-- (the film is even mentioned in the opening/ending credits).  If not for that, it is possible that Noe would have been \\"praised\\" for treating the subject in such visceral way rather than the conservative manner that the other 99% of films do. <br /> <br />The second half of the film leads up to the course of events that lead to Alex's attack and the couple's relationship before all of that takes place.  In a lot of ways this is the most important part of the film, not just because it adds depth tothe film but also because so many people walk out that they don't get a true feeling of what they went to see.  It is impossible to say how one will feel after viewing, or at least attemting to, this for the first time.  But I would highly recommend that if you're going to watch this, give it some thought first, so that if you chose to watch it, you'll watch it in its entirety and thereby know what you really think of it.
B00005KFUM|5.0|I first got into Muse when they were announced as part of the Big Day Out 2004 lineup. Origin of Symmetry was the first album of Muse that I came across and to this day remains one of my favourite albums ever. In one review, Origins is described as forgettable. This is certainly not the case! This album take you on an journey through 11 truly epic songs.  <br /> <br />Stand out songs for me are New Born, Plug In Baby, Darkshines and Feeling Good. These were hard to pick as the whole album is totally fantastic. <br /> <br />A necessity for all great album collections, I strongly recommend going out and getting yourself a copy. I also recommend Muse's other albums Absolution and Showbiz and if you can, go and see them live. It's an amazing experience that I have had the pleasure of having 2 times already. Hullabaloo, Muse's live album, does a great job in capturing their amazing stage presence and passion. <br /> <br />If you already love Muse, or are just getting into them, go and get this album. You won't regret it!
B000002MTU|5.0|I'm a big Blues fan.  I love the Blues live.  I'm also fortunate to have a brother with the most fabulous collection Blues on the planet.  I decided to work my way through his entire collection, and I put off listening to much of his Blue collection because it was too big.  So I started oon the less daunting task of browsing his rock collection.  After listening to many of Clapton rock albums, frankly I was not impressed.<br /><br />On the other hand, I stumbled onto this CD, and it turned out to be one of those special CD's where I loved every track.<br /><br />Eric Clapton, may not be your traditional blues singer and picker, but you can't argue with his talent on this CD.  Worth picking up.  If you like Clapton and the Blues, don't miss it.
B000060MWU|3.0|this film is just the typical david lynch, and is not much of a surprise, if you know his movies. <br />it reminds of \\"mullholand drive\\" in many ways, but despite of that, as fan of mullholand, \\"lost highway\\" is not exactly my cap of tea. <br />the film is TOO DARK, loaded with emotions mixed with LACK of emotions, horror, and sexuality driven to sickness. <br />which all sounds great, if only the director realised that people who are watching the movie didnt come here to get PUNISHED, and want to enjoy the film as well. <br />it could have been better if lynch would break the \\"tense atmosphere\\" once in awhile, so that the viewer could breath. <br />not to mention the film is way too LONG, so that at a point you just want it to end. <br />however, the soundtrack is brilliant, and matches the film perfectly. from \\"the smashing pumpkings\\" to\\"maryling manson\\"(who also had a quit shocking perfomance in the film with twiggy), \\"rammstein\\" and up to \\"lou reed\\" and \\"david bowie\\". <br />as a whole, this is a classic david lynch film. <br />if you like his films, this is a MUST see. <br /> however- its just too overrated. <br />
B0002JJBZE|5.0|I really enjoyed watching my old favorites in the new 5.1 sound. The explosions rocked my woofer and rattled the walls. The cases are unique with the colors probably corresponding to the colors of the different uniforms. The inside case is a bit cheap for the price of the set but it works fine for now. I'm not looking forward to a few years down the road when the packaging ages and the inside case becomes brittle. But all in all a great buy and a long time in coming!

B00003CXCT|5.0|You folks who are giving this film series on DVD 1 star should be banned from seeing Episode III when it's released. GET OVER IT.. Welcome yourselves to the REAL world. I saw these films many times in their original versions, and these revisions are clearly better. YES, I'm a fan of the films, and I don't mind any of the changes. They hardly seem noticeable when you focus on the best part of Star Wars.. THE STORY.. George Lucas has every right to change these films, and I'm glad he's doing it. If the originals were released on DVD, they wouldn't fit into today's world, and would be boring to watch on a surround sound system, and High Definition TV (If I want to watch them in Mono, and without any of the dazzle of this set, I have my VHS copies, but I bet I never do) Star Wars has always been far ahead of it's time, and this is yet another example of trend setting. I'm sorry so many of you are stuck in 1977, but for me this is a great trilogy and these DVD's should win over many new young people. I'm sorry, but if a young person (such as my family) watches the original verisons of these, they are bored because they are used to the type of enhancements Mr. Lucas has given us on these versions. I completly enjoyed all 3 of these movies.. so ignore all the complaints and buy this box set!
B0000026DJ|5.0|So much is made about the message of these songs.  Forget about that.<br /><br />The thing that I like are the songs themselves.  These are not one hit wonders.  Midnight Oil delivers one of the best CD's of all time.  I liked every song, and rated 6 of the 9 songs as 5's and the rest 3's.  I've had this CD for more than ten years and still listen to it often.  It's in my must have travel bag.<br /><br />Buy it and you will thank me.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Zoolander is easily one of the best comedies out there. Funnyman Ben Stiller shines as Derek Zoolander, a male model who is not the smartest guy around. His competition is Hansel (Owen Wilson) another male model. When Zoolander is beaten for male model of the year award by Hansel, he decides to retire as he belives theres to life then being \\"really, really ridiculously good looking\\". When he is asked back by fashion designer Mugatu (the hilarious Will Ferell) he is reluctant but accepts, little does he know Mugatu has a secret plan to brainwash Derek to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister. Also starring Jerry Stiller (Ben's dad) and Christine Taylor (Ben's wife) this film is hilarious and very entertaining. Stiller and Wilson are excellent as rivalling models and also very funny. If you're looking for a good comedy you cant go past this one.
0789723107|5.0|Everytime I find myself wondering how I should do something on a site, I reach for this book and find a good answer.  I suggest buying it and then rereading it every six months just to make sure you aren't slipping back into bad habits. <br />The book is both concise and entertaining enough that you won't mind and your site(s) will be the better for it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a must see.  George Bush is a most dangerous man.  This movie only touches upon the secrets which are glossed over by the mainstream media.  Check out the picture of the young George Bush at an oil well dedication in the book entitled \\"The Prize.\\"  It's easy to see what the motivating factors are behind this war.  Iraq has the 2nd largest known oil reserves on this planet.  I really find it hard to believe Bush wishes to see democracy in a predominately Islamic fundamentalist society.  We really have more in common with the minority Sunni's (which is why we supported Iraq in the war against Iran).  Do a search for a classic photo of Rumsfield and Saddam shaking hands during Donald's visit to Iraq.  The US military was completely aware that biological weapons were being used against Iran at that time.  Currently, our media is not covering the Niger yellow cake story because it would be inappropriate before the election.  Talk about forged documents.  So, thank you Michael Moore for getting a very small yet disturbing amount of information to those who are not afraid to ask the difficult questions for fear of being labeled \\"unpatriotic.\\"  \\"A true patriotic is loyal to his country always and to it's government when it is deserving\\" (apologies to Mark Twain).  This current administration is surely the most undeserving ever.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I don't have much time, because I will be studying for midterm, but I feel like reviewing this CD I've had since February. <br /> <br />Although more refined and less raw than \\"Mer de Noms\\", A Perfect Circle continues its tradition of thought-provoking lyrics and haunting music. Billy Howerdel and Maynard James Keenan are musical geniuses, but put together with their talented drummer and other guitarists, they make the best band. I've seen them in concert in SF, CA, and man, I will always remember them as my first concert. <br /> <br />\\"The Package\\" is a great opening track. While I was listening to the CD, it starts off softly before blaring off loudly. It totally rocked the seat out from below me. <br /> <br />\\"Weak and Powerless\\" was the first single. It was great, not awesome, but great at first, but after hearing it again a few months ago, I realized that this song contains actual musical depth. It is one of the songs I listen to most frequently from this CD (but I listen to all the songs). At the concert, Maynard dedicated this song to California's new governor: Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br />If you listen to the lyrics of \\"The Noose,\\" you will find how powerful Maynard's words are. The lethargic-like beat of Josh's drums and soft hypnotizing guitar string creates a soothing atmosphere among the hopelessness of Maynard's voice. <br /> <br />\\"Blue\\" is supposed to be the third single, but I'm not sure. There's nothing too striking about this song, but I love it anyway. <br /> <br />\\"The Vanishing\\" wasn't a favorite song (since it's more instrumental) until I went to the concert. The concert opened up with this song, and coupled with the expert use of lights and shadows to create a haunting mood, instantly made this song memorable for me. <br /> <br />\\"The Stranger\\" is one of the softer songs on the CD, but still an awesome favorite. The cricket-like sounds in the background created a real atmosphere of being outside in nature at night. The guitar complemented the mood of the night. I loved it best when they utilized some deep drum sounds near the end, reminding me of thunder. <br /> <br />Being the second single, \\"The Outsider\\" was quite heavy. Although the band members loved the Bikini Bandits in the music video, I didn't like it too much. I don't recommend the music video. I like how this whole song matches APC's theme of haunting guitar \\"solos.\\" Maynard really uses his voice, almost shouting. <br /> <br />\\"Crimes\\" is another instrumental piece, but I like listening to the drums, bass, and, as mentioned before, APC's musical theme. This song just screams out the style of \\"APC.\\" I don't know what's up with the voices near the end though; sounds like people are talking. <br /> <br />\\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" was a cover of a band... I think it was called Failure. One of the softer songs with weird lyrics. When I first heard it, I hated it, since it didn't sound like APC. After a while, it grew on me. If you find that you don't like this song, I suggest going to [...] and download one of the concert mp3's of this song. I'm almost sure you'll love it, since it's the rock alternative version. <br /> <br />To me, \\"Pet\\" has to be the heaviest song on the album. It started off heavy and ended heavy. I got my friend addicted to that song. This song has political implications about how the whole of America seems to be asleep, oblivious to what Bush is doing with his Iraq war, or following along with his secret agenda. Excellent song; highly recommended. Billy's guitar really stands out near the end, taking turns with Maynard for the spotlight, like a tag team. <br /> <br />If you have listened to Tool's \\"Aenima\\" CD, you will notice a real similarity. \\"Lullaby\\" is like a different version of \\"Pet\\"; this is similar to \\"Jimmy\\" and the organ version called \\"Intermission.\\" I didn't notice it at first until I actually sat down to analyze every song on the CD. The melody of the voice is an imitation of the guitar on \\"Pet.\\" <br /> <br/>\\"Gravity\\" is more mellow, heavy on the bass. The overall mood is more uplifting, giving a sense of hope and healing with Maynard's lyrics. Perfect way to end the CD.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This is my favourtite movie of all time. Cruel Intentions is a movie about seduction and betrayal. We have Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn Mertueil, step brother and sister who are bored rich kids living in the city, they also specialise int he above mentioned qualities. Sebastian is a bit of a lady's man and is getting bored of seducing and sleeping with the same kinda girls. He wants a challenge. So Kathryn bets him he cannot seduce the new headmasters daughter (Anette Hargrove, Resse Witherspoon) at school, who also happens to be a virgin and is firm on her stance to wait for love before losing it. The rules of the bet are if Kathryn wins she gets Sebastians hot car, if Sebastian wins he gets to sleep with Kathryn, when Sebastian asks \\"why would i go for that bet?\\" Kathryn sums it up by saying \\"Because im the only person you cant have and it kills you\\". So with the rules in place and the clock ticking Sebastian sets off on his mission. The only obstacle is falling in love. This movie is exetremely entertaining, the music, setting and acting is all excellent, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe excel as the seductive siblings and Resse Witherspoon is also great as the innocent Anette. The soundtrack to the film is also stunning, the music is mellow and complements the film perfectly. Overall a real classic.
B000001F3C|5.0|An indisputable rock classic, WAR was U2's first \\"big\\" album. It gave the band a huge international following, and effectively cleared the field of any serious competition for the post-punk throne. With its fervent political commentary, poppish sensibilities, killer hooks and vague nods to world music, it also served in many ways as the band's blueprint for the remainder of the '80s. Henceforth U2 would become a social as well as a musical phenomenon, its overt dedication to various headline-grabbing causes alternately complementing, combatting and at times even eclipsing the quartet's artistic accomplishments. Whether you love or hate U2, chances are WAR has a lot to do with why you feel that way. <br />   With a pseudo-martial drum statement now nearly as familiar as the opening lick of \\"Satisfaction,\\" \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" starts the proceedings off in typically absolute fashion. One may choose to read this angry song as either a celebration or condemnation of the Irish nationalist cause - or neither, which probably makes the most sense - since the lyrics, for all their earnestness, are a good deal more ambiguous than the spare and sharp music behind them. So easily does U2 pull of this transformation into explicit topicality, however, that it's rather surprising to think it took the band until its third album to begin addressing political issues so directly. <br />   \\"Seconds\\" expands on this new, socially conscious side of U2, with The Edge sharing vocal duties for a strangely catchy number about atomic bombs, power brokers and the eternal possibility of instant annihilation for others' mistakes. in lesser hands the message would undoubtedly sound rather clumsy - the names of countries and capitals are tossed out like buckshot, with the stark assurance that in all of them \\"It's the puppets who pull the strings\\" - but then as now, Bono found ways to make profound truths sound as obvious as they really ought to, while his bandmates drove those truths home with fully realized, no-nonsense arrangements. <br />   \\"New Year's Day,\\" another classic track, may be the album's strongest song. The haunting piano figure which underpins the melody sounds as distinctive today as it did twenty-one years ago, while the lyrics cleverly alternate the woes of lost love with grander and more threatening sorrows. \\"Like a Song,\\" on the other hand, shows that Bono's penchant for bombast started early. Having apparently run out of specific gripes, he here takes aim at just about everything and everyone, getting downright silly by the end. \\"Drowning Man\\" sounds like earlier U2, a droning number complete with violin, which only brings home how much Steve Lillywhite cleaned up the band's sound for this album. As much as U2 itself, he is responsible for WAR's greatness. <br />   \\"The Refugee,\\" my personal favorite track here, combines thundering percussion and heavily processed guitar in a portrait at once harrowing and humorous. \\"Two Hearts Beat As One,\\" another single, is one of the band's stronger early love songs. \\"Red Light\\" goes a bit over the top with its blasting trumpets and girl backup singers, but \\"Surrender\\" makes extremely effective use of the latter in its huge chorus and extended ending. \\"40\\" closes the album on its softest and most profound note, with Biblical lyrics perfectly summing up the catalogue of ups and downs presented over the preceding forty minutes. For all of those ups and downs, WAR is justly famed, and an essential addition to any serious rock music collection. <br />
B0002O7XWC|5.0|Referring to Jack Nicholson's dialogue in this movie: It's about freedom as and soon as you start showing your freedom and waving your flag... here comes someone with a different lifestyle/viewpoint to shoot you down. Frankly, I think it's quite prophetic. Look at our world today. 'nuf said. <br /> <br />I say this after attending a showing of \\"Easy Rider\\" and his directoral debut, \\"The Hired Hand\\", (which really was quite interesting), in Houston with Peter Fonda being present for commentary and pressing flesh. Afterwards, he spoke about each film. True, the quality of \\"Easy Rider\\" is low. It was made in the late 1960's, whad'da ya want? They used the best they had back then. Also, another problem due to Columbia throwing it in the vaults and to forget about it. This improper storage resulted in a reel suffering water damage. I believe it has been generously restored by Sundance. <br /> <br />\\"Easy Rider\\" is about freedom, freedom being taken away. Sure, it's dated and funny to watch those 3 well-known actors in their early days getting baked around a campfire, but it has a message...
B0001BKAEY|1.0|What a total copout!!!!!! It was like they were in such a hurry to release the movie, they forgot to make sure the story actually followed the one before.  This was supposed to be it.  Didn't expect this movie to beat the others, but i did expect it to complete the three  in a positive way, so that the viewer would leave wanting more. Instead i couldn't get out of the cinema fast enough!!!! <br />WHAT A LET DOWN.
B00028HBKM|1.0|The movie is not worth rating.  It is anti-semitic, \\"anti-christ\\"  and only reaffirms the fact that the only \\"christian\\" who ever lived died on the cross.  However, it is another worthy addition to the collection of fairy tales that make up the mythology of \\"christianity.\\"
B0000DC13U|2.0|I'm a really big Stones fan. Im actually wearing a Stones shirt as I write this. I've glanced at this on and on, until a few nights ago I was given a Gift Card and decided to buy it.<br /><br />Well I started watching it and the whole process of developing this great classic song was awesome. But the Director's crap with the incoherent babbling of some man, weird scenes with a bunch of Black Panthers was completely pointless in my opinion. I had to skip these segments quite a bit to get to the hidden jems in this movie.<br /><br />Again, I loved seeing the band develope the song, it was phenomenal to get that Insider's perspective, but the rest was crap. I was expecting something similar to The Who's Kids Are Alright, where they show scenes of them in the recording studio, with unadulterated footage, but Sympathy was something much different. This is worth renting to see the band, but I wouldn't suggest owning it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was a HUGE fan of the original star wars series (saw each movie at the theatre at least 10 times EACH) and already own the trilogy in VHS (which I have watched over a million times because the tape is starting to fray). I have to say, though the DVD Widescreen version of the Star Wars Trilogy far exceeded my expectations and is one of the best purchases I've ever made with regards to DVDs. The image quality is absolutely excellent and if I can remember right, even better than the movie release. Sound is great in that I thought the VHS version sounded muffled. In the DVD version, you can hear what everyone is saying although there are maybe a couple of spots where there's a blip in the dialogue but nothing too noticable. I did not mind the additions/changes to the DVD with the exception of the very last scene in \\"Jedi\\" when they substituted Hayden Christensen for the actor who played Luke's father. This is the only addition that I didn't care for since the face of Anakin had already been revealed earlier during the death scene of Anakin Skywalker so Lucas should have been consistent and just kept the original scene with the same actor. Unless you saw the newer Star Wars movies and knew that Hayden Christensen plays the young Anakin, the last scene with HC in the scene doesn't make much sense because you wouldn't know who he was. Also, why does Anakin get to be young but Ben is still old? (unless that is explained somewhere in the new Star Wars movies?) Anyway, this was the only change I objected to. The rest was fine. Overall though, this is a wonderful trilogy!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Its totally pointless, but thats what makes it what it is. dont watch it just buy it. or steal it whatever you have to do to get it.
B00005OM5L|5.0|I bought this DVD a number of years ago when it was first released and I get more from it each time I watch.  There is an obvious chemistry between Eric and the band. <br /> <br />My only criticism is not of the performance of the band, (brilliant), but of the director. <br /> <br />Why, oh why, did the director of this DVD think we wanted to see long shots of the stage, close-ups of the crowd, or the back of EC's head, when he's in the middle of some of the best guitar solos you're ever likely to see?
0451196716|4.0|Wow, this book kept me turning pages quicker than thought imaginable. I generally read anything, but majority is either classics, fantasy, or science fiction. But my guitar instructor suggested I read this book, so last week I ordered it, and read it within three days. Generally I don't breeze through a book like that. The story unfolds, and it keeps you questioning left and right about whats going to happen next, why are they in this walk, who is going to buy the next ticket. I suggest anyone who is even mildly interested to read it. As you read the book, you start to feel like you are one of the fellow walkers, experiencing the agony, and befriending everyone. By the final chapters, you've personally become friends with everyone, wishing they don't buy the ticket. The only thing I didn't like was the swift ending, but other than that it was an amazing novel. <br />
B0001YRVN4|5.0|It's great, it really is. Sure, some things are different/changed, but it's all there and is a must-have for any DVD collector.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, because I found the picture quality to be too dark during some scenes of Star Wars ( a new hope ) the other 2 movies were fine, also the packaging of the set was on the cheap side. <br /> <br />I am 45 and have grown up watching the movies as they were originally released in the theatres, I have no problem with changes and additions to the movies, If they make sense. <br /> <br />The most noticable change was to the Return on the Jedi, with the ending. If your going to replace Darth Vader with a younger version of himself, i.e. the no talent hack that plays him in the recent stars wars movies, then you should also replace Obi-Wan with a younger version as well.  <br />P.S. I did like the Ewok song at the end, which was dropped. <br /> <br />I wish Lucas would have done like the new release of Alien, and had both his new version and the original version on the disk. I think this would have made the purists happy, and I could have dumped my VHS versions. Now I'm still stuck with both.   <br /> <br />I don't think I will be convinced to buy any more releases when they happen, as I have no interest in the new star wars films. The new films while being visually good, are hampered by one big problem ( the actors suck, and have the personality of a tree stump ).  <br /> <br />I am not sure where Lucas dug them up, he must not have been able to get Van Damme or Steven Segal.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I will praise this movie.  It is really a very intelligent and somewhat dark movie.  The actors were great, and I loved the teen spin on the book.  I do think that the other two movies done on this same book (\\"Dangerous Liasons\\", and \\"Valmont\\") were more accurate, but all in all this was a great movie.  I think that Sarah Michelle Gellar was great for the part.  She was almost as good as Glenn Close and Annette Bening.  I also really loved the soundtrack.  There is some great music on there.  You should check it out.  Great movie and Ryan Phillipe is absolutely gorgeous!
B0001Z37HM|3.0|If you're even looking this up, I'm sure you are a fan of the Conan Movies, Willow, Krull, Beastmaster, etc. Yes, it is another fun and exciting little cheesy Sword and Sorcery film. This one does a good job with blending action, humor, and fantasy into a simple and fun film. If you're looking for an intense movie, try something like Fight Club, but this is one of those movies that you turn your brain off and just enjoy. <br /> <br />There is a lot of cheese in this movie, but I think its up to par with Conan The Destroyer, and much better than Kull The Conqueror. If you're looking for another Robert E Howard style Hyborian Age tale, try this one for size. <br />
B000002BFZ|4.0|You won't find another PJ album, or grunge album, like this. This is the sound of a band questioning life, love, God, and the main theme to this whole album, is there a \\"code\\" in life that can explain why things happen? Look to the title of the record to find the band's answer. For album name saying there's no secret to life, it's ironic that it's all about finding deeper meaning. <br /> <br />Lyrically, this is the most spiritual collection of songs you'll ever get out of Eddie Vedder, as of yet. \\"Sometimes\\" questions God's existence. \\"Who You Are\\" the hypnotic song, is about philosophies reguarding our place in the world. \\"Present Tense\\" is the best example of spiritual song on this album. \\"I'm Open\\" is a spoken word refelction of a person who's been spending his whole life looking for meaning, sort of a story that recaps on everything in the album. <br /> <br />Vedder is at his most emotional here, talking about isolation he feels on \\"In My Tree\\", vowing not to do drugs on \\"Habit\\" and to me, the best song on the album \\"Off He Goes\\" which is the one song Vedder has written that will push tears into your eyes. Vedder has never been as honest and open as he is on that song. <br /> <br />Musically, this album is the strangest Pearl Jam has to offer. Soft-brooding tension on \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"In My Tree\\", a thunderstorm on \\"Hail Hail\\", \\"Habit\\" and \\"Lukin\\", clap/sing-a-longs on \\"Who You Are\\", unplugged warm acoustics on \\"Off He Goes\\", mid-tempo melodies and harmonica on \\"Smile\\" and \\"Red Mosquito\\". The epic centerpiece \\"Present Tense\\", pop/rock sound on \\"Mankind\\" (with Stone doing vocals), spoken word acid trip on \\"I'm Open\\", and the languid lullaby \\"Around The Bend\\". <br /> <br />The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars, is because of it's too un-evenflow. No pun intended. This is Pearl Jam's richest and most original album, but at the same time, it's just too hard and obscure at times. This is also without a doubt one of the hardest cds to get through in one listen, Iguarantee it.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|Roger Waters was being an egotistical, control-freak at this point in the Floyd's career, causing significant damage to the group's overall musical quality and to the usual equal distribution of talent between band members. Gilmour's influence is considerably scarce here on \\"The Final Cut\\" (control rests nearly entirely in Waters' hands, as I said), and Nick Mason is pretty much non-existant in terms of musical influence. I suppose one could nearly label this album as a Roger Waters solo album, if not for Gilmour's occasional, beautiful soaring guitar solos amidst several of the songs (and \\"Not Now, John\\" of course).    Despite the disappointments, however, Roger's lyrical genius still shines true here and songs such as \\"The Gunner's Dream\\", \\"The Final Cut\\", and \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" make the album purchase worthwhile after all. The first time I heard \\"The Gunner's Dream\\", I was mesmerized by it's lyrical beauty and the dreamy, soothing piano. Same goes for the title track, and \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" serves as a perfect closer for this primarily Waters-based Floyd album. Roger Waters may have been on quite an ego-trip during his last years as a member of Pink Floyd, but his lyrical/musical genius does not go entirely unnoticed on \\"The Final Cut\\".    For devout Floyd fans such as myself, \\"The Final Cut\\" is an obligatory purchase simply because it is essential for a complete Floyd collection. Even still, however, it can be a pleasant listen to mellow out to, but don't expect another \\"The Wall\\". It is marred with several disappointments and flaws but, even still, it has its moments, and those beautiful moments make up for the ugly ones quite well for the most part.    A fitting closing album for Floyd's last days with lyrical mastermind, Roger Waters.
B0002VKZL6|2.0|What a disappointment!  I gave it several listens then finally cut my losses and traded it in.  There were several tracks that grabbed me on his previous solo efforts, but nary a one this time out.  If you want to hear some \\"Dire Straits\\" sounding guitar licks, pick up Tony Joe White's \\"Heroines\\" or \\"Snakey.\\"
0201633612|4.0|If you are wondering what design patterns are.. well this book isn't for you, for now. Design patterns are  cool, indispensable, useful ways to combine objects to build better OO programs. (Here better means basically more clear, extendable, maintanable, and elegant). Now, this is the book that started the design patterns \\"frenzy\\" and this is of course both good and bad, since in this frenzy some folks start to forget that good OOP ins't only about design and that design patterns are simple ways to combine object and not rocket science.<br /><br />Anyhow... this book is not very good as an introduction to the subject, due to its  dry and sometimes obscure style.<br /><br />It is a very good read though for someone who has already read a more tutorial-like book (like \\"Design Patterns Explained\\" or the excellent \\"Thinking in Patterns\\" that you can download for free at Bruce Eckels's site) and wants to see them explained again from the \\"masters\\".  This book<br /><br />is extraordinarily useful and important, you cannot go without reading it if you are an OO programmer.. but still I wish that the style was simple and down to earth.<br /><br />Most of the sample code is given in C++ but you don't need to be a C++ pro to read it. Some is in Smalltalk.. mmmm and that was definitely a bad idea .. but you can just skip it without losing anything.
B000001FLI|5.0|Un album sencillamente sensacional, donde Roy Buchanan da buena muestra de su maestra y virtuosismo con la guitarra. <br />Msica nunca exenta de la sensibilidad y capacidad de transmitir emociones necesaria para convertir un buen album en una \\"obra maestra\\". <br />Totalmente recomendado; una pieza fundamental de cualquier discoteca de rock que se precie.
B000002NIW|5.0|As a devout music enthusiast, I have quite a variety of tastes - from Tori Amos and Nine Inch Nails, to Opeth and Primus. However, my normal and default approach to the so-called \\"nu-metal\\" genre is one of disgust and an irritated roll of the eyes. I first approached Deftones in this same, stereotypical manner, but the music and the enraged screams of \\"Shove it, shove it, shove it!\\" that came blaring out of my speakers surprisingly impressed me. I knew then, that this wasn't the typical Fred Durst-esque \\"nu-metal\\" that I was so used to passionately hating. Basically, Deftones' \\"Around the Fur\\" struck me as a completely different animal. <br /> <br />\\"Around the Fur\\" is filled with all the pissed-off, drop-D guitar slams you could desire, but there is also the unique voice of Chino. One moment he's tearing his lungs into screaming shreds, the next his lovely, stoner-melodic vocals croon over the musical barrage in such a way that it left me with a slightly surprised/pleased expression on my face (an incredibly rare sight when \\"nu-metal\\" is the source of music). My personal favorite tracks include \\"Mascara\\", \\"Be Quiet & Drive (Far Away)\\", \\"Around the Fur\\", \\"MX\\", and especially \\"Headup\\" (that particular song gets my adrenaline pumping and gives me the uncontrollable urge to break someone's face). <br /> <br />An overall impressive, \\"nu-metal\\" record indeed. I was surprised. Perhaps you will be as well.

B00000JLWW|5.0|i'm admitting that it has its flaws. the dialouge is a bit cheesy and sounds like I probably wrote it. but the directing was fabulous! the acting was great and they did a great job with a not so great script. but what really pisses me off is how people call these two charechters selfish!!! Rose and Jack were in love!!! rose wasnt happy with her SELFISH fiance...were you not watching the part when she was considering jumping off a ship, she couldnt say that she loved cal and he hit her???? she was infatuated with Jack and his lifestyle...she was forced into this rich snotty life...and she never liked it! her finace clearly did not love her the way jack did! and sure, jack was not rich and couldnt promise her the fabulous and boring lifestyle cal could...but rose didnt want it! she wanted to go out and see the world...she was clearly born into the wrong lifestyle! she lost her virginity to jack,but she loved him and she didnt love cal! she wasnt comfortable around cal the way she was with jack, she was always quiet and seemed very bored (kate deserved that oscar, her portrayel as rose, who struggled and evolved was amazing)! cal didnt really care if rose died! HE TRIED TO SHOOT HER!!! and although at certein times the affects did look fake, the whole movie was, scary, sad, thought provoking, moving and very well done! i particularly loved kates work in all this! I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! IT IS TRULY AMAZING AND DESERVED ALL THOSE OSCARS!!!
B0002S94OS|4.0|This CD was very different from \\"As the Palaces Burn\\". It's not as good, yet it is still very creative. I don't like how Randy started getting into writing political lyrics in some of the songs. They really ruined the few songs unless I tuned out the vocals in my head. Other than that, they had some very creative guitar licks and really good riffs. The double bass drums as always definitely add to the METAL feel of each song. This is one of the best metal bands out there.
B000068QKT|4.0|It's most likely just personal taste, but I wasn't blown away by this movie as much as most of the other people here seem to be. It was a valiant attempt, sure, for a director who'd only made dark films before to try to film a light comedy. Somehow, it didn't quite click with me. I judge this film a good effort, but I think that it missed its potential too often.<br />I'll start with the first problem: The narrator. The narrator is present throughout the film, basically describing the story at every step; whenever a new character comes into the film, the narrator describes their \\"likes\\" and \\"dislikes\\". For me, this was especially distracting at the beginning of the film, when new characters came onto the screen so quickly that it was difficult to keep track of them all. Also, I may be alone, but I find the concept of judging a person by what they \\"like\\" and \\"dislike\\" to be a very shallow way of looking at them.<BR>The narrator is the \\"easy way around\\", but I don't think he's the best; sometimes, I really wished that Jeunet would use him less and use other ways, such as images, sequences, or conversations to tell the story.<br />Another thing that botherred me was the film's attitude to love (don't read the next sentence if you're underage); that true love comes only through flirting and passionate sex. There is NEVER any conversation between the people in the film who are in love that would show that they love each other for something other than their bodies or their outward mannerisms; instead, it's all instinctive, impulsive, physical love. Really, I found it a bit silly, shallow and demeaning to the viewer.<br />Thirdly, almost all of the characters in this film, including Amelie, are so different from me or anybody I know that I simply can't relate with them at all (with a few exceptions like the \\"Glass Man\\" or his assistant). Most of them are well acted (like the man who played the \\"Glass Man\\"'s assistant, the immigrant artist/fruit-stand worker; brilliant), but I also find myself not finding them very interesting or realistic, and the ones that I DO find interesting are not the main characters...<br />Lastly, the story still feels too \\"fake\\", a leftover from the director's previous films. It was fine in \\"City of Lost Children\\" and \\"Delicatessen\\", where I suspended my disbelief somewhat because they obviously took place in alternate universes to ours. \\"Amelie\\", however, is too close to the \\"real world\\" for me to make those same kind of allowances. It often seemed too \\"glossy\\" a picture of the real world to me (I know that this is what Jeunet was going for, but that doesn't mean I have to like it).<br />Having now displayed all of the reasons why I DIDN'T like it, you may be wandering why I'm still giving it 4 stars. :)<br />Basically, because despite all of the flaws, it was brilliantly filmed, suceeded often enough to keep it interesting, and left me feeling relatively satisfied at the end. Most of you will probably love it; if the premise sounds like something that you would like, then go ahead and give it a try. Personally, I wasn't sure that it was quite my type of film, and I turned out to be correct in that regard. If I had to rate it, I'd give it somewhere between 75-79/100.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica's 3rd album, Master Of Puppets (1986) is by far the GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME! Everything about it is good. Singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield has a vocal roar on this album that cannot go unrecognized, and some pretty good soloing skills as well as rhythm skills to be reckoned with (though he's no Schaffer.) Lead guitarist Kirk Hammet is one of heavy metal's greatest guitarists ever. It's too bad that it's as if he isn't even there now that they've dropped the solos. Bassist Cliff Burton is (was) the GREATEST BASSIST EVER! His solos are monster, and the normal bass lines are top-notch (as a bass player, he is one of my biggest influences.) Too bad he's dead. Drummer Lars Ulrich is a monster in the way of blast beats, he's about all of Metallica that's any good anymore.<br /><br />And now on to the three highlights of the album. It's hard to pick since all of the album shines brighter than anything they have ever done. But perhaps the three best tracks are \\"Master Of Puppets,\\" \\"Orion,\\" and \\"Damage, Inc.\\" \\"Master Of Puppets\\" is perhaps my favorite song from the album, and my second favorite Metallica song (only to be defeated by \\"One.\\") It features a bit of a bass solo that is to be reckoned with, and the solos totally rip! \\"Orion\\" follows the tradition of \\"Call Of Ktulu\\" in making a classic instrumental, with another bass solo by his majesty, the late Cliff. And \\"Damage, Inc.\\" may be the most brutal closer I have ever heard. From the little bass intro by Cliff emerges the most intense blast beats and guitar riffs you will ever hear. Be prepared, young and early metalheads, for the band that produced \\"St. Anal Probe\\" was once a heavy metal monster.<br /><br />\\"From memories of '68 when the wizard shook the world, metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled.\\"-Halford
B00003CXCT|4.0|If you want to talk about visual quality - and that's one of the big reasons to buy a DVD version of a movie even if you have a VHS copy - then this is superb, deserving 5 stars.  You will notice that the colors are much more saturated and, it seems to me, color has been added in some scenes.  I never found it to detract from the movie, it was always an improvement.  Two scenes I like to point out are both in ESB:    1) Training with Yoda    The whole environment looks much more earthy and alive with vivid hues of brown and green everywhere.  Even R2D2 looks noticeably different, almost organic as if he is molding-over in the soggy environment.    2) The carbonite room    In the original film and subsequent VHS releases, the colors in that scene are really saturated and the lighting is low, making VHS versions appear to bleed color between areas.  Here the DVD really shines as the colors are even more saturated and do not bleed at all.    So why just 4 out of 5?  I wasn't blown away by the audio.  Heck, this is from Lucas - the guy founded the company that owns and licenses THX.  Naturally I was expecting really (...) audio.  But, alas, it was only \\"okay\\".  I have a mid-range 6.1 surround sound setup, and it's correctly tuned for my living room.  I was expecting to be surrounded by sound - something that doesn't always happen with surround sound encoded movies.  I mean, often it seems that the surround channels are only used for the occasional directional audio effect.  I was expecting to hear tie-fighters, xwings and the Falcon swirling around me, but that really wasn't the case.  It may not be fair for me to knock it down to 4 just cuz I expected crazy-good audio for no reason other than my own imagination, but hey, that's how I feel about it, reasonable or not.    Anyway, I still think the DVD is worth owning.
B00005IC2H|5.0|incredible.  <br /> <br />no amount of accolades can give it adequate praise. this might be the pinnacle of the post-rock phase, although GYBE's Lift your Skinny Fists is a definite rival. however, the two cannot sound more different. though marginally apocalyptic, this one more appropriately belongs beside your Symphony of Sorrowful Songs CD, as one of those few works that you will most definately need when you are just hanging on, and are in desperate need of the magic of music. it'll be waiting for you then. <br /> <br />all-time, hall-of-fame stuff.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is for sure one of green day's best albums. All the songs are great. Buy it now.
B00004LN16|3.0|I thought that Stiff Upper Lip was okay, but not their best.  This album doesn't match up with their previous one, Ballbreaker, which I still play more.  I like Satellite Blues on here.  The rest of the album is hit or miss as the band stays with the same kinds of songs about dirty, naughty sex.  They aren't as R. Kelly-ish in terms of the raunchiness on this album, compared to the '95 one.  There's not one hint of the catchiness of past AC/DC albums, but more of a focus on the music this time.  There is a bluesy feel when I hear it and I think they wanted to recall their roots/influences on this album. So I have to say this--this is not one of their best albums.  Good kinds of songs; just doesn't fit with the band at all.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I listened to it and don't like it. Buy king of all kings by Hate Eternal. With only three members they remain heavier than slipknot. Every song has a solo, they are noisier, the drumming is faster, the vocals are better, and the bass guitar is really heavy.
B000002OZY|5.0|Tommy is a superbly crafted CD that kicks every other Who CDs ass out of the water. Now, many people will disagree and say that Who's Next is better, but to them i say that Who's Next is more fun. But as far as musical complexity and artistic quality goes, Tommy wins by a mile. <br /> <br />Lets start with the story. Tommy is (as im sure you already know)about a young boy who is so traumatized by witnessing the murder of his \\"father\\" that he becomes psychosomatically blind, def (jam), and dumb. His mother can't watch out for him, so she gives him to her brother, Ernie, a child molesting bastard who's son beats Tommy up. Tommy's parents eventually get him back and begin experimenting with numerous \\"cures\\" until they find one that works. Tommy, now being able to see, speak, and hear, begins being noticed for his amazing pinball talent. He is noticed so much, in fact, that a semi-religious group is formed around him. <br /> <br />Now the music. Keith Moon is one of the greatest drummers of all time, and this CD truly showcases that. On tracks like \\"overture\\" and \\"Underture\\" he takes advantage of the long time-period available and wails on the drums like he had a life long grudge against them and he is taking it out on these tracks. Pete Townsend's vocals are in peak condition and are only paralleled on \\"Baba O' Reily\\" from Who's Next. Not only are hs vocals great, but his guitar is amazing as well, and the many layers of sounds on tracks like \\"Christmas\\" and \\"Sally Simpson\\" are excellent.
B000068MKZ|5.0|this cd is so beautiful!.. i bought it based on the reviews here and was definitely not disappointed. all the songs were beautiful and dreamy, but the first song was the best (the title track) even though i don't speak french i learnt the lyrics so i could sing along to it... perfect for cruizing around in your car or chilling out at home...
B000002J1U|5.0|This was the last Zeppelin CD I Purchased, and I immediately was hooked on its more optimistic, light sound. All of the other Zep CDs are predomitaetly dark sounding with an occasional fun, happy track, but on III Zeppelin must have been real happy because almost all the tracks on III are filled with positive energy... and honestly... its kinda bizzarre, and really caught me for a loop. The only tracks that sound truly Zeppelin on the first listen are \\"The Immigrant Song\\" and \\"SIBLY\\" other than that, casual Zeppelin fans will be shocked, so be warned, if you are a \\"fan\\" who just listens to \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" when they are on the radio, just stick with Zeppelins Greatest Hits CD \\"Early Days\\" that should suit you just fine. <br /> <br />IIIs unique sound makes it a must for any hardcore Zeppelin fans. <br />This was the first Led album that used Acoustic Guitar and Mandolin in its tracks. Robert Plants ear splittingly high pitched vocals shine on tracks like \\"Immigrant Song\\" and... well... almost every other track. But his one of a kind sound is best exibited on \\"SIBLY\\" the beautiful blues ballad that is probably the best crafted song on the disc, with its addition of excuisite guitarmanship by Jimmy Page. As I said before, this is a masterpeice album, but its not for everyone. <br /> <br />Immigrant Song (10/10) - Great intro to a great CD, strong drumming, bass, guitar and vocals. awesome hard rocker. <br /> <br />Freinds (8/10) - The music is great, but damn are the lyrics cheasy. <br /> <br />Celebration Day (9/10) - Good Track, not much to say. <br /> <br />SIBLY (11/10) - The best song of the album is also one of the best Zeppelin songs of all time. <br /> <br />Out On The Tile (10/10) - Again, great track but not much to say. <br /> <br />Gallows Pole (10/10) - I love the mandolin bits and the lyrics. Love - It. <br /> <br />Tangerine (10/10) - Gives \\"Going To California\\" a run for its money for best love, song, acoustic thing <br /> <br />Thats The Way (10/10) - Awesome lyrics, this is a beauty. <br /> <br />Bron-yr-Aur stomp (10/10) - fun stomper with pulsing drums. <br /> <br />Hats Off To ROy Harper (10/10) - Some love it, some hate it. Most people hate it because its really distorted and bluesy.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Thank god I have the real originals on VHS. I didn't buy this crap but I heard enough about it to know that they kept the extra stuff they put into it after they remade it in 97 and added more. That was enough for me not to get it. I don't mind them cleaning it up and making the picture look better but when you start to add stuff, its like why, it was fine the way it was. I don't know what is wrong with Lucas but he has lost it as Episode 1 and to some degree Episode 2 show. He no longer has the creative force with him. He has gotten so greedy which is why I call him Greed Lucas. I'm just going to wait till the price of VHS to DVD copyers go down then copy the moives to DVD. Its not illegal as long as your making a copy just for yourself.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Music that is good is this. simplely amazing sounds.  every song is phantaztic except the slow dumb ones.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I love all the reviews about the movie that cry out \\"LIES' but then nobody lists any. One reviewer jokes about laughing at the wrong parts because he was laughing at Mike's \\"lies\\". Of course he doesn't say what the lies are or offer any counter points. All the critiques are foul cries of \\"traitor\\" and \\"unpatriotic\\" with no explanation. No counterpoints. No actual citations of factual errors. Just people using \\"lies\\" as a euphemism for not liking the movie. It's quite telling that even the Right and Fox News didn't offer any substantive critiques of the facts presented in the movie. All the arguments where in the emotive character assassinating style we've all come to know an expect. If you go to Mike's site you can feast your eyes on an exhaustive factual backup of the main points of the movie. Gee, do you think Mike wasn't aware that if he put out a movie with a ton of factual holes in it that it wouldn’t gleefully be taken to task? It’s not like the Right doesn’t have the resources. But alas no. The best they can do is call him a traitor and talk about striping his citizenship or deporting him. All of which are of course traditional American values.  <br /> <br />People need to drop the borrowed criticism and see this movie for themselves. I've heard so many interviews where people were ready to offer up their borrowed opinion on the movie and then professing to not have actually seen it. If you don't want to buy it at full price then rent it or borrow it but if you haven't seen it then you have no foundation for criticism.
0790730960|5.0|A mesmerizing and haunting achievement; a mixture of bold cinematic techniques that reminded me of certain scenes from  The Scarlet Empress, or the silent opening of David Lean's Oliver Twist.  Marvelous and convincing acting on the part of Danny de Vito, and Christopher Walken and just about everybody else, regardless of the high humour and sustained madness of the narrative. A shining,  brilliant and beautiful film. Gripping, entertaining, worth study. I loved it.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|&#60;a href=&#34; [...] <br /> <br /> <br />This movie had a great plot, Jake Gylenhaal is a definitely fantastic actor who I enjoyed watching. I really was happy with the ending, it was a good ending and satisfying.
0380778556|5.0|A twentieth Century classic. The book takes the archetypal framework of Bronte's Jane Eyre --  mysterious house, brooding hero, and dreadful secret -- and makes of it a riveting, complex and timeless psychological story without ever drawing attention to the old bones being re-assembled.  The book proves among other things that there are no real cliches when it comes to plot or spectacle.  Profound characters, fresh insights, fine dialogue and keen observation  can transcend the  trappings of any genre.  If you haven't seen the film with Joan Fontaine and Lawrence Olivier prepare for a treat. But read the book first. It's rich and wonderful. In fact, Jane Eyre and Rebecca may be the finest examples we have of what later became known as \\"the woman's gothic,\\" a form so popular that once its stylized covers were on every drugstore rack in America.  Those days are gone, of course, as the purveyors of  fiction satisfy a demand for greater variety and depth in their every changing audience. But Rebecca and Jane Eyre remain undeminished and powerful as ever. Basic truths are enshrined in both; and both unfold their unforgettable moments in beautiful language.  Scholars and avid readers may want to see also the brilliant study of female  literature,  The Mad Woman in the Attic by Guber and Gilbert.
950491036X|3.0|Most of the reviewers in this page say that the book \\"trapped\\" them from the very first page. I don't agree, but these Spanish readers have to furl to something easy to read and with no demand in concentration or analysis. I find Ruiz Zafn preciouscist in his idiom, pedantic in his approach to his tortuous theme, and overextended in his length (more than 538 pages).     Editorialists compare him to Borges as Ruiz Zafn intends to replicate the Argentinian author's idea of the labyrintic library. If Borges were alive I'm sure he wouldn't like this comparison. Where the Argentinian saves words with exquisite care and writes no more than the necessary to savor each of his scarce pages, the Spaniard writes pages and pages of rubbish as a possessed.    True, his evocation of the Barcelona of the pre and post Civil War is remarkable, but this doesn't make this book the motive of   such good critique as it has received.     With so many really good and interesting books one wants to read and with such a short life ahead of us, why should we read authors like this. They say Ruiz Zafn lives in Los Angeles, California, and is preparing his next novel. God save us from that.    You want to read a good thriller? Read Eric Ambler, the same Borges, Perec or LeCarr.

0767827694|5.0|This film is simply stunning! All around a marvel and delight to behold. Virginia Woolf was ahead of her time if this portrayal of her novel is correct.  <br />The story is pure genius in that what most readers/viewers miss is that the main character is simply not human but rather portrays England itself in its own realization of maturity after the reign of Queen Elizabeth, whom is ment to act as the catalyst whom sets Englands/Orlando's realization of herself in motion.  <br />I challenge all to look at this story again with new eyes. You might just see that Orlando is Mother England herself! Spectacular!
B0002I831S|5.0|I have been waiting for this for years!  It's finally here and I am not disappointed at all with this product.  The casing is awesome. It's thick and durable and well designed. It opens from the top with a hinge on the bottom. The DVD's are in a separate plastic cd holder inside in book format that lets you flip through them easily and quickly to select the discs you want to watch. The video quality on these is crisp and clear and the sound is awesome... Dolby 5.1 folks!!! The bass has low frequency booms, the red alert comes out of the back speakers, echoes and aliens are thrown to various speakers. Computer sounds, explosions, and ship combat is like you've never heard before. :) If you love the old series, you will come to love it more with the remastered video, sound, and music. Why is the casing yellow for the first season? Because the Star Trek titles were yellow during season one. The season two casing is blue because the star trek titles were blue in season two. Not sure about red yet for season three, but probably just a pick they did since season three was in blue titles also. The set comes with a pamphlet outlining each episode and some other paragraphs containing history and encyclopedic information about the Star Trek universe. The extras are great too!  <br /> <br />I consider this to be an exceptional and quality set! Very, very pleased. It was far superior than I expected. And I shopped around for the lowest price. Amazon.com had it!  <br />
B00005OWEG|5.0|The original &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34; is an awe-inspiring masterpiece and is my all-time favorite film. Memorable scenes abound, starting with the blow-your-mind opening with Willard (Martin Sheen) having a mental breakdown in his sweltering Saigon hotel room to the tune of The Doors' &#34;The End.&#34;<br /><br />Speaking of Sheen, people overlook the fact that he expertly carries the film. His haunting narration is one of the most effective narrations in cinematic history and hooks the viewer into the nightmare-adventure.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the noteworthy scenes, but I'll resist, except to comment on Col. Kurtz: Was he really insane or actually an unrecognized genius? General Corman informs Willard: &#34;He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops.&#34; And, yet, Kurtz was accomplishing what the US military couldn't or wouldn't do because of political complications and niceties. I bring this up because, as I've aged, I've come to see that I'M Col. Kurtz in some ways -- operating &#34;out there&#34; beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work.<br /><br />The script was written by John Milius with alterations by Coppola as he shot the film while the narration was written by Michael Herr. The meaning of the story is obvious: The trip up the river led by Capt. Willard exposes him to two extreme viewpoints of war represented by the two colonels he encounters on his long journey, both of whose names start with 'K,' which is no accident: Col. Kilgore (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle; he therefore feeds off it and glorifies it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he &#34;loves the smell of napalm in the morning.&#34; War to him is just another day so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war. Col. Kurtz (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's the ultimate horror and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard. The existential Kurtz becomes increasingly disillusioned after jumping ship from the system and now has no sanctuary. Death is the only way out.<br /><br />The &#34;Redux&#34; version was put together by Coppola in 2001 with the addition of 53 minutes of material that he originally cut. Very little of the added footage works. Most of it simply drags the film down; the rest is either boring and unnecessary or adds a dimension of silliness, not to mention being badly scripted and acted.<br /><br />The first let down of &#34;Redux&#34; is revealed when Captain Willard hooks up with the boat and crew who are to escort him up the river to find Colonel Kurtz. In the original there's a water-skiing scene on the river which dynamically introduces us to the absurdities of every-day life in the field in Nam (with the Rolling Stone's &#34;Satisfaction&#34; blaring). In &#34;Redux&#34; this part is cut and pasted to an hour LATER in the film, horribly muting the original's introduction to life-in-the-field. (I realize WHY Coppola did this -- because the scene was originally intended to be shown AFTER the boat crew steal Kilgore's surfboard -- but he made the right decision to omit the board-theft scene and place the water-skiing scene near the beginning).<br /><br />The introduction of Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) in &#34;Redux&#34; is good. The charisma of this air calvary colonel in all his swaggering glory is perfectly showcased in this brief snippet; but the scene's so brief it's unessential.<br /><br />The four main new scenes definitely DON'T work: The scenes involving the theft of Kilgore's surfboard are silly, badly scripted and unnecessary. In fact, they ruin Kilgore's perfect swan song in the original. Moreover these scenes reveal a goofy side to Willard that ruin his grim mystique in the original.<br /><br />The additional bunny sequence during the rain storm is also silly and unnecessary; it's a huge letdown even if your sole desire is to see some more skin.<br /><br />The longest added sequence involves the French plantation mentioned in the 1991 documentary &#34;Hearts of Darkness - A Filmmaker's Apocalypse.&#34; Small bits of this piece work and enrich the film (like the ghostly discovery of the plantation), but on a whole it's too long & talky (where it's impossible to understand the heavily-accented dialogue without subtitles) and simply bogs the film down.<br /><br />The final added scene that is unnecessary and reduces the potency of the original film is the sequence involving Kurtz reading a couple Time magazine articles to the caged Willard. This is the FIRST and ONLY time in the picture that we get to see Kurtz CLEARLY in broad daylight, and it destroys the great mystique of the character that was so perfectly built up in the original. In this scene we plainly observe that Kurtz is just some fat dude in the jungle suffering a mild case of madness.<br /><br />So Coppola made the right decisions with his original 1979 edit of the film. The new footage of &#34;Redux&#34; should've simply been relegated to the &#34;deleted scenes&#34; section of the DVD. After all, not every idea that is birthed during the creative process is worthy of the final product and &#34;Redux&#34; proves it.<br /><br />GRADE: Original version: A+ ; Redux: C+t; but the scene's so brief it's unessential.

0316776963|5.0|This book is close to a masterpiece.  David Sedaris convinced me that I don't have to be an important or exciting person to be a good writer.  He finds material and humor in the most unlikely yet obvious places, places I never thought of looking. He creates vivid pictures of his family,most of all of his father.  Sedaris describes his father's obsession with saving everything in a colorful and entertaining manner.  \\"He hid pastries in the toolshed and the laundry room and then he wondered where all the ants were coming from...he hides these things...until they are rotten.  Ant ehn he eats them.\\"  What I found truly amuzing was the chapter entitled \\"Jesus Shaves\\" and how translating sayings or titles in other languages makes them awkward and confusing.  When trying to explain the significance of Easter to a Moroccan student in French class all the student got was something about \\"A dead man with long hair supposedly living with her father, a leg of lamb served with palm fronds and chocolate.\\"  I read this book in one day and it's definetely a page-turner.  The pages are filled with emotion, ranging from the pain of losing a pet to the feeling of surrender and \\"all-mightiness\\" of being on speed.  Sedaris does a great job of molding his life from little anecdotes.  He not only exposes his life to the reader, he also adds in smart reflections on life and people's actions and behaviors.
B00012QM86|5.0|Please be intelligent enough if you are going to watch this film. I had seen so many idiotic letters for this review and so many complaints about the flip DVD and its packaging. These people seemed not to talk whatever about one of the true purposes of this movie. That is, some people can have their conscience developed so that they can make a positive mark in this world. And if enough people became like this, willing to risk everything to join the fight against evil, this world would be in better shape. I'm sure that all the people who were so downright negative did not know that Speilberg used so much of his time and money after the movie was made to create and develop an enormous project to make sure that the memories <br />of the Holocaust will be kept alive in part by taping as many Holocaust survivors all around the world about their stories during the time when this world was turned upside down. He knew a permanent record will be needed since there are less and less Holocaust survivors as each day passes. For the people who say that since the Holocaust happened 6 decades ago, and thus there is no reason to remember this singular madness (1933-1945), all that I could say is that by ignoring the past and therefore not learning about it, it can happen again. That is, state sponsored satanic ritual abuse to Jews and others regardless if they were infants, children, or adults of any age. And the ways they were all murdered should haunt decent people forever.
B00005JN7O|1.0|This movie got all the looks but totally void of soul and substance. Strictly made for little kids or little kids at heart, the stardards are set pretty low here and I wondered what kind of a person would throw money away after they read this humble review.<br /><br />The special effects are pretty good, acting proves to be above par and since most of the film were shot in front of blue screen, I would say that the acting proves to be more decent then I expected. Anglina Jolie get one of the top billings although her part is quite limited. (She more like an Lara Croft in uniform.) I loved the two seat P-40 super duper fighter that become a submarine and flies forever. Its seem to be this movie version of the flying Batmobile!! The other leading actors, Gwenyth Paltow and Jude Law are likable but their characters have much substance and soul as stuff panda bears!<br /><br />Where the film failed lies in the actual plot and script. The plot is so thin that it probably won't even make it as a comic book story. The dialogue proves to be so lame that they won't even used it in the comic book!! I must respect both Paltow and Jude Law for saying some of their lines with such professionalism since its really required real acting to say some of the lamest lines with a straight face. It also pretty sad that some of the lines seem to be borrowed from other films. I kept thinking to myself during the film, \\"I think I heard this line before!!\\" The actors kept referring to \\"First World War\\", are they in the second during the movie??? (No, I don't think so but its a good example of such attention to detail this movie seem to lack - even for a science fiction movie.)<br /><br />While some of the previous reviewers called this a comic book on the movie screen, I would have to say that its less then a comic book and more like a children book overblown into a movie.<br /><br />Its without a doubt, this film got all the trappings of a bad movie. Smart characters doing dumb things just to advance the story. Silly humor spread out throughout the movie. This movie, overall, is a super lightweight science fiction flick with very few redeeming value. The appreciation level is basically along the sixth grade level. Probably make a great DVD babysitter in the future.gs just to advance the story. Silly humor spread out throughout the movie.

B0000TB03W|5.0|Have had this DVD for about 5 months now and absolutely enjoy it. The video & audio quality, song selection, and overall first rate concert performance is a 12 on a 10 scale. As we expected, Shania's lead vocals are top notch, but what totally blew me away was the talent of her back up musicians whom also are her back up vocalists. The musical ability of this group is unbelievable and can't be overstated. Have seen many concert DVD's and this one's the absolute best. Enjoy!!
B0001AVZA8|1.0|It's hard for me to believe that this movie was as popular as it was. This movie was terrible. Don't let yourself be fooled by the movie's stars, either: Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton's performances are perfect, but there's only so much an actor can do with a one-dimensional character. <br /> <br />The beginning, with Nicholson and Diane Keaton's daughter is unengaging, as neither of the characters are compelling, and the situation isn't at all interesting. <br /> <br />Cue, then, Diane Keaton, who, boring and unrealistic as she is, is only as uninteresting as her sister--the man-hater--who shows up with her.  <br /> <br />At this point, you're watching a movie about four characters living together, and you--I, at least--don't like any one of them. <br /> <br />Then Keanu Reeves shows up. Keanu Reeves is the worst character in the movie. He plays the rich, smart, congenial doctor (you might think these are \\"spoilers,\\" but they hardly ruin the movie) who's attracted to Keaton, despite her age, because he loves the way she writes. It gets even more absurd toward the end of the movie. Call it sweet, but it isn't realitic. <br /> <br />Of course, the love story between the two leads is also wholly unconvincing, in that they hated eachother at the beginning, and still seem to.  <br /> <br />And after they do get together, Diane Keaton becomes a completely different character--but not a better one.  <br /> <br />Either way, I'm no fan of romantic comedies, but this movie is a disgrace to the genre in that it isn't funny, and it isn't romantic. <br /> <br />It's a movie that would've put me to sleep, if I weren't so angry about it.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|At some point, you've just got 'it'. In this case, the naturally flowing guitar style, the intimately expressive talk-singing, and easy-going songwriting. It's worth listening to as the continuing chronicle of Knopfler's work, but definitely on auto-pilot.  The relaxed sound of a man who's got nothing left to prove is not a bad thing, but I'd rather hear him prove something.
B00005JN7O|3.0|It's all about style, of course, and there are some design elements I really enjoyed. Large doses of WOTW and Metropolis, with dashes of Flash Gordon and James Bond, and other cool stuff like a pretty good rendition of what a Spitfire/Mosquito hybrid might have looked like if it were designed to operate underwater as well. The dark, sepia-like tones of the film are attractive and nostalgic. The attempted 1930s-style archetypal characters and dialogue, though, don't really come across very well: shallow in writing and choppy in editing, with much less energy than the action-fest by which the characters are surrounded. Of course, the precepts of the film are ridiculous, but you knew that, it's part of the genre. <br /> <br />The bottom line: Go to a matinee to see the pretty stuff on the big screen, but bring a book for when people are talking. <br /> <br />Actually, you know what a fantasy of mine would be? Re-creating this movie with lively, retro dialogue written by the Coen brothers, like in The Hudsucker Proxy. That way, the actors might compete with the visuals.
B000002J2D|2.0|Ugh. No wonder Steve Hackett left the band. An uneasy attempt at mixing prog rock musical elements and pop music. Nevertheless, the band members' musicianship is still much in evidence.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I like College Dropout, it is very consistent hip album, my only concern is even though going to college is not a guarantee for success, you have a bigger chance being successful getting a degree than pursuing a music career.  I think it is a poor message to give to young people especially young African American kids, but since he is speaking mostly from his own experience I guess that is ok.
0780023013|5.0|Spirits of the Dead\\" is a movie based on the  horror tales <br />written by Edgar Allan Poe and it features a barrage of movie stars who were just starting out in the business in one of their most unseen great performances in our time. Seeing as this was an International Film done in Europe (movie <br />features English subtitles) it's no wonder why too many people in US haven't seen it, its a shame because it's a real good movie. <br /> <br />The film features early stars such as Jane Fonda (Barbarella, Klute and many great classics), Peter Fonda (Easy Rider), Terrence Stamp (Superman 2) , Brigitte Bardot (International Sex Symbol and great actress who retired at age 39) in absolutely astonishing roles based on the tales of Edgar Allan Poe. The film is divided into three tales \\"Metzengerstein\\", <br />, \\"William Wilson\\", and \\"Toby Dammit\\". All three tales are wonderfully directed by the three great directors: Louis Malle, Federico Felini and Roger Vadim. <br /> <br />The first tale stars Jane Fonda as Contessa Frederica <br />a rather cold hearted and sick individual that despite her <br />beauty derives pleasure from deceiving others and inflicting <br />pain. When she meets Baron Wilhelm (Peter Fonda). She attempts <br />to change her ways, however the Baron is not interested in Contessa. What results is a mixture of a tale involving <br />revenge and supernatural as although Contessa fuels her need for revenge , she pays a price at the end. The last scene in this tale directed by Roger Vadim is rather excellent, showcasing the interesting visual techniques that showed Vadim's brilliance at the time. <br /> <br />The second tale entitled \\"William Wilson\\" is probably the tale I liked the most, since it was a tale about an intense rivalry and jealous between one individual and another that would end until someone's demise. It stars Alain Delon a disturbed , young boy, whom like Contessa Frederica is a rather nasty piece of work, even worse so. It seems that young Wilson is a rather insecure , young brute, whom to establish himself decides to manipulate become violent with those weaker than him, like a dictator shown in early scene where Wilson at age 10, aids his fellow crappy tale I liked the most, since it was a tale about an intense rivalry and jealous between one individual <br />and another that would end until someone's demise. <br />It stars Alain Delon a disturbed , young boy, whom like <br />Contessa Frederica is a rather nasty piece of work, even worse so. It seems that young Wilson is a rather insecure , young brute (whom reminds of a certain white trash individual in Kansas lol), whom to establish himself decides to manipulate become violent with those weaker than him, like a dictator shown in early scene where Wilson at age 10, aids his fellow crappy recruits in abusing a young child by draping in a barrel full of rats. <br /> <br />Wilson's fun days of brutality are over though, as  a young boy steps forward and stops the abuse.  When our little misguided fool confronts the boy, he is shocked to learn that the boy's name is also \\"William Wilson\\" and that the boy looks like himself!! From here on out, every attempt at crime and brutality <br />by the evil Wilson is stopped by the good Wilson. It's absolute hilarity and a battle of wits as no matter how hard he tries to hurt someone (including trying to surgically perform surgery <br />on a live patient) as the evil Wilson is stopped by his good counterpart. The end is very fitting, but it's not quite the end, you might expect. Not to spoil the tale by saying anymore , \\"William  Wilson\\" directed by Louis Malle is one of his best efforts. <br /> <br />The last tale of Edgar Allen Poe to be adapted to the screen is \\"Toby Damnit\\" changed from the original title \\"Never Bet the Devil Your Head\\" is also an interesting tale although it times it can hard to watch for the fact that Terrence Stamp's <br />character of Toby is utterly annoying. <br /> <br />However Spirits ofthe Dead is a masterpiece as another person, I am surprised other so called movie critics with no credibility but who are \\"advisors\\" on other sites haven't reviewed it.
B00004R99J|5.0|Most children are introduced to historical figures via Disney movies(i.e. Davy Crockett and Pocahontas).  I know this movie made me hunger for more info about Pocahontas and John Smith.  Thank God for sequels!  No I'm just kidding.  I searched through the Encyclopedia and even read a book written by Ingri D'Aulaire about the famed Native American.  I recommend this movie along with the book to all children out there.      Well, I'm still a fan of this movie after many years since it came out on video and who isn't?  Maybe the sequel wasn't as good but that doesn't mean that we can't enjoy memories of the first movie.  And for the person who said not to judge them by their jokes.  Why did you type your jokes on this page?  This is a childrens page where children would go.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I have my musical (I am a musician playing Steel, Guitar, Dobro) roots in blues, country and jazz similar to Nora's. I just returned from an outstanding concert at the Berkeley Greek Theater tonight featuring the lady herself.  She played some new stuff yet to be recorded, most of her previously released material including this CD and a couple from her new CD which will be released soon. Folks we are talking over two hours this artist entertained. Passionate? You bloody well right! She is beautiful, powerful, intense, sultry, passionate, dynamic, seductive and has a fast wit with a very wholesome sense of humor. I respect her even more now that I have seen her, so I will say in complete rebuttal to the morons who seem to have a case of envy here; go bark up another tree and play somewhere else. Nora is a class act in EVERY REGARD! Buy this CD and every subsequent release. She is a very special lady and SHE DELIVERS! Nora deserves every bit of acclaim she has received and more! Give her a listen and you will be satisfied beyond mere words; mine or the boneheads who are compelled to dismiss her very real talents! Take care ya'll.
B00000099Y|4.0|Tool is definitely different than ANY other band out there.  Love this album for it's pure kick ass style.  This is probably the hardest album from the band.  I saw Tool live in Hawaii back in 2002 at relatively small venue.  I was just getting into Tool at the time and I have picked up every album since I saw them live.  If you ever get a chance to check out a concert.....go!
6304362498|5.0|in this chilling film,the government monitors all of everybodies actions via computers.winston and his woman must keep thier love a secret or theyll be in violation of federal law.any lawbreakers are tortured so bad theyll confess to anything just to get it to stop.hes also keeping a diary which is another no no since the computer cannot actively follow what he is writing.the kids will probably be bored.i dont know who directed it,but the book is by george orwell who is better known for animal farm.its my second favorite book right behind a clockwork orange.its really low budget.i think this is a movie for intellectuals,but everybody should see it.theres an older movie version from 56 also.it is 100%  consistent with the book.ive never seen one so closely adapted.even how i pictured it in my head was accurate and thats astronomical!the message is let the machine roll on.you are but one tiny piece.its awesome.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Mark Knopfler is not in Dire Straits anymore. Many people need to learn that first. This is a fantastic album with well-thoughtout melodies and amazing lyrics. The entire album seems to have a certain groove to it, that keeps you wanting more. It just seems to flow throughout the album, something that many albums today lack. This album shows Mark's vocal range more than any other he has created (including Dire Straits). Don't get me wrong, because I love listening to my old DS albums, but this cd shows how far Mark has really progressed. It is a cd you can keep playing over and over again, and not get bored.
B000062XM3|5.0|this movie has a suprise twist that is really cool!but its a suprise!the story is that theres this guy who played a skinhead in american history x and brad pitt.the main dude,not pitt,blows his condo up and moves into an abandoned house.then one day after work,pitt wants to fight his friend for fun after work.then some people see and watch.this leads to an underground after hours bar fight club.it reaches bigger and bigger proportions until there are fight clubs all over the country.this leads to operation chaos.they too have a certain dropped out of society mentality and go around blowing up government related things a lot.the kids wont like it and its pretty violent for them anyhow.its a little bit action and a lot psycological.its pretty intellectual but not un-understandable.it looks low budget like american history x but is way better.i cant think of too many other brad pitt movies i like except snatch where he plays a gypsy.this one is far beter.it is my third favorite movie!theres this emotionaly fried chick whose in love with brad and used to do the main guy.shes nothing to get exited about though.both the main characters give off stupendous performances!its way better than anything youve ever heard.belive it!the parts leading up to the big finale are really intense!its an excellent movie.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane has drawn numerous comparisons to other bands, but in my opinion, they have a 80s feeling to me. I think this comparison is apropos, since 80s pop was much more synthesizer heavy; Tom Chaplain's voice reminds me of Freddy Mercury in his ability to emote and sing with passionate intensity. The music has a feeling of space and openness that I haven't felt since listening to songs like \\"Reap the Wild Wind\\" by Ultravox.  I also feel a feeling of youth and passion that also reminds me of early Tears for Fears.  <br /> <br />Hopes and Fears gives a fresh but familiar (to me) style that I really appreciate and I feel that others will really enjoy.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|I have been a Alan Parsons fan since day one. I have never been disapointed with any of his albums. Obviously I like some better than others, but they are all great albums and A Valid Path is no exception. I was a little anxious about this album since I knew he didn't have his long time band mates and was venturing more into electronica music, but I am very happy with it. Is it his best album? No, but it is very good nonetheless. Especially the song You Can Run. We just got back last night from seeing him on his current tour. He had about a 30 piece orchestra with him and was well worth it. Just thought I would get my two cents worth in.
B000268QB2|5.0|Magnificent... A real piece of art. When I first heard his first production \\"Somewhere only we know\\" I thought, that guy sounds like The Beatles and a little bit of U2. People call this kind of music \\"cold play\\". I'm not a erudite of British music but whatever they call it, I LOVE IT!! Buy the album. I recommend it.
B00000JY1X|3.0|this is way overrated, but this is still a good album. There are a lot of great tracks on record, more good than bad actually, but people who think every track on here is gold are just kidding themselves. About half the songs on each disc are just filler, pure filler. The songs that are outstanding really stick in your mind but this album is all over the place folks. It is not really inconsistent . Just listen to it and get the songs you really like.
B00028HBL6|5.0|As a devout Catholic, I looked forward to this film a great deal.<br /><br />I was not at all disappointed.<br /><br />I think it needs to be said that while most of the film is true to the Gospels, this is still what I would consider a work of art--it is Mel Gibson's very deeply personal interpretation. That doesn't lessen the impact of the film for me.<br /><br />The experience of this film was a very personal one for me as the viewer. None of the unrealistic 1950/60's films' bloodless and passionless depictions, none of the Mary looking like an fair Irish lass out of a holy card--barely registering emotion at the foot of the cross, none of the WASPY looking blonde blue eyed actors, or aloof Jesus....<br /><br />Thank goodness! It's about time someone showed the more personal side of this greatest story ever told. And that would include a large amount of blood and pain and suffering--that's what \\"passion\\" means--and that's what Mel achieved: THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. THIS IS WHAT HE DID FOR YOU.<br /><br />Be mindful of some scenes if you haven't noticed them directly: Veronica's veil, the Last Supper/Crucifixation scenes as Mass, and the face of Mary--looking into the audience as she holds her dead son at the foot of the cross--have you noticed? Are you aware? She is directly looking at the audience as if to say, \\"Now that He has done this for you, what are you going to do about it?\\"<br /><br />I am thankful to Mr Gibson for having the courage and the tenacity to see this through.<br /><br />It was not anti-semitic either. If there are people around still subscribing to that mistaken view, they are coming from both ignorance and their own particular prejudices. There were no pogroms, no one was hurt or killed, none of that happened because of this film.<br /><br />Instead, a few criminals who had seen the film came forward to confess their crimes--the film had that kind of impact on them.<br /><br />Now that it's on DVD I expect more good will come from this masterpiece as many more people have a chance to see it.<br /><br />It is now the standard by which all religious films will be compared. The bar has been raised...od will come from this masterpiece as many more people have a chance to see it.   <br /> <br />It is now the standard by which all religious films will be compared. The bar has been raised... <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I only ordered this album because a friend of mine said it was awesome, but then said he was biased, so i'd have to see for myself.  Anyhow, I'll admit I liked a couple of Green Day's songs in the past, but certainly wasn't a big fan or owned any of their albums.  So I decided to buy this cd just on good faith, and I was shocked to find out just how good it was.  I'm still floored about it.  It's currently my new favorite album.  It displays talents more than a punk-rock cliche anger (although its still present in the songs).  Definitely a good buy.  Worth the money!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Great lyrics. Appears like she is wearing her heart on her sleeve on this record, and one can hear her vulnerability and heart ache in such songs as \\"My Happy Ending.\\"  The songs on this record are very much relatable.
B000056V73|5.0|At first impression, the story of a young boy coming of age. on second thought, much more than this. Who is he? A young writer. Does he seem like the young, naive type? No, he seems grounded solidly-- if trecherously-- in reality. He absorbs the impact of his new experiences in the wild world of rock and roll-- including loosing his virginity-- as if something else is on his mind. Or someone. <br /> <br />We are not concerned whether the young boy will suffer as his inner naivete clashes with his reality. Rather, we are concerned whether what he chooses to write about will reflect accurately the world as it is-- the conflicted lives of his hero rock musicians. We are concerned with which world he chooses, not which world he is capable of dealing with. He is a writer; a lens of reality. And he chooses truth. <br /> <br />It is fitting that he should love a woman who represents the opposite -- a woman who lives in a self-conscious fantasy world, in love with a rock star. She walks as if an apparition. She is a temptress; a muse. The rock and roll band sings to her. It is through her eyes that the lead guitarist sees himself as genuine and talented. <br /> <br />But we see that same guitarist on the roof of the house of a fan, yelling that he is a \\"golden god\\" while tripping on acid. The band wonders whether he wants them. He wonders whether he wants the band-- but he stays with them because it makes him look cool. He accepts popularity with his band as an alternative to developing his full talent. <br /> <br />His band is becoming popular, taking the leap from small-time to big-time. The musicians are quarreling, adulterating, and it is not until they are almost killed in a plane crash that the truth comes out. <br /> <br />The question facing these characters is what is real? Will the woman step out of her fantasy world? Will the rock musician verify the story that the boy gives Rolling Stone, and expose the unmerciful truth that accompanies it? Will he stay with theband? Seen this way, the movie becomes a stunningly integrated masterpiece. <br /> <br />The boy's face has an innocence that stems from truth-- not naivete. And that is why everyone is unusually honest with him; that is why everyone loves him. But what will they say to him, how will they treat him? After all, he is a rock journalist. He is the enemy.
B0002O7XVI|5.0|Indeed, beauty does have its price.  One of them it seems is notoriety, for why else should this consummate jewel of a film rest so unacknowledged in the pantheon of great epics?  It wasn't a financial flop at the time of its original release, as it grossed close to $100 million at the US box office; nor was it critically denied as the recipient of three academy awards plus an Oscar nomination for best picture.  Still very few people today evoke or even recall the majesty of Polanski's work here.  It's a shame.  One I hope will be partially rectified with this DVD's release.<br /><br />\\"TESS\\" is one of the most stunning, memorable and emotional epics ever shot.  It's a film that picks you up and carries you away to a pre-feminist era where even the most hardened sexual traditionalists will find themselves burning bras and advocating Steinem, Friedan, Walker and De Beauvoir.<br /><br />This movie should be required viewing for any girl reaching the age of twelve.  Not only will it teach them how to resist the lure of trading upon their youth and beauty as a means of advancement in life.  It drives home the difficulties of regaining one's independence once such qualities have been exploited.<br /><br />Wonderful work abounds in this production but it is Polanski's sober direction, Kinski's achingly earnest performance and Geoffrey Unsworth's and Ghislain Cloquet's extraordinary cinematography that carry the day.<br /><br />\\"Once victim always victim, that's the law.\\" - is the heartbreaking line Tess delivers to the evil Alec as he attempts to regain her favor amidst her own personal tragedies.  The upper hand, briefly, is hers as he sneers his response with a mouth full of blood after being struck sharply by her heavy farm worker's glove.  If no man will defend her honor then damn it she'll do it herself.  You go girl!!!<br /><br />P.S. While the film is first rate, this DVD transfer is not.  Tess aficionados will notice that several edits have been made to the film,the most shocking being when Tess is picked up by Alec in his gig for transport to Trantridge.  In the original film as Tess is being driven away her younger sister asks her mother \\"Is that the gentleman who's going to marry our Tess?\\"  Whereupon the mother replies \\"God willing my girl, that's the one.\\"  On this DVD version, silence.<br /><br />Also the music over the ending credits has been altered!  Instead of the dramatic resurgence of Tess' tragic theme that had my heart in my throat as a teenager, I was aghast to hear a downbeat replaying of one of the soundtrack's minor themes, thoroughly robbing the film of its powerful Stonehenge set crescendo!<br /><br />I love this movie so much that I am still giving it five stars but is this the best Columbia could do for one of its classics?  Shabby treatment indeed for what merited a milestone!  One can only hope that somehow Criterion will get their hands on the rights and give this work of genius the debut it deserves!
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart.  However, any other film maker probably would have made this movie so unbelievable that viewers wouldn't know how vicious Christ's death was.  Mel Gibson lets us see exactly what it was like 2000 years ago in Israel.  No sugar coating or anything artificial.  Gibson doesn't hold back and leaves no stone unturned.  Gibson captures the essence of Jesus Christ's sacrifice for us all.  Not to be  preachy, but I hope those of you who watch this movie know about the life Jesus lived and appreciate his sacrifice for our sins.  This movie hits home and is clearly the best film of 2004.
B00004RFFI|3.0|I love this movie. Yup, it's lame and you find yourself wishing the tornado would win. It is just plain silly - supposed to take place in Oklahoma but you would find such great cornfields in Iowa maybe instead. The cow is just plain fun and we find ourselves looking forward to \\"Cow.\\" The lines are weak and the characters pretty dorky but all in all, the movie, while it has absolutely no redeeming value, is fun to watch for its silliness. No person can run through a cornfield such as our heroes do and not get sliced to pieces by the sharp edges of the corn leaves. Every farm kid knows that. And the final scene in the barn with all those sharp edges hanging from the rafters... sigh. I can't imagine any farmer taking the time to hang stuff when there are all those blank walls... However, enough said, pop some corn and start the movie, suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the fun. Twenty years from now, \\"Twister\\" will be camp.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|In my personal belief i always thought mark knopfler was the best guitarist in the world with eric clapton being a close second. I've read that mark would always use his guitar to make it sound like it was singing for him and it sounded like he didn't want to sing until he got to sailing to philadelphia. Now with one album of experience down his second one is just building on how strong he can sing. I think \\"our shangri-la\\" is the best song on album. I don't understand \\"don't crash the ambulance\\" but it's got some funny lyrics.
0451526295|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jane Austen's Mansfield Park.  While it may start out a bit slow, after the first few chapters the rest of the novel is captivating.  It is hard to put down.  It is the story of an interesting love triangle that takes place in Britain during the early nineteenth century.  At this time in society, wealth, or the appearance of wealth, controlled people's lives.  If you were not of high social background, you tried to appear that you were.  This is the case of the main female character, Fanny.  After being sent by her mother to live with her wealthy uncle, Fanny learns the ways of sophisticated, well-learned people.  She becomes accustomed to their ways and is accepted, though not always treated equally.  She and her cousin, Edmund, become very close until separated by an attractive family that joins the Mansfield Park community.  As Fanny grows she becomes loved and even more beautiful.  She is soon the object of many men's affections.  However, Fanny is torn between living in the wealthy Mansfield Park and returning to her poor home in Portsmouth, which she thoroughly misses.  Where does Fanny choose to live?  Who does she choose as her husband?  You must read this great novel to find out.<br /><br />If you liked this book, you might try some of Austen's other novels:  Sense and Sensibility, Emma, Pride and Prejudice...
B00028HBKM|1.0|As opinion maker, Hermann Goering wouldn't do better. Mr Gibson proved himself a very harmful filmmaker; he should definitely stick to Mad Max and Lethal Weapon's foolish but entertaining acting.<br /><br />As an action (!?) film it's BAD. All the torture and brutal spanking takes us back to \\"Mondo Cane\\" in the seventies (or sixties?).Seems like a free session of sadism and hate.<br /><br />As a religious film, is as valid as an Iraqui film showing their \\"martyrs\\" and children being slain savagely by occupation soldiers (that's what the Romans were, right?).<br /><br />Let's stay here.<br /><br />Once Orson Welles made innocent people kill themselves by radio and upon a joke.<br /><br />Imagine how easy is to manipulate today's masses through powerful  images and good photography. Anyone who falls in this great commercial trap should reconsider his own perception.<br /><br />One point in favor - the language -aramaic,latin and hebrew - seems quite original and appropriate.
B000009EOR|4.0|It's not very good reviewed and I don't know why.  It's a very good album with the most memorable moments on the 70's. They even include 4 new tracks (NEW??????? They are 20 years old right now....................Whatever).<br /><br />This four new songs are pieces that were left off from The Elder (I don't know if all, but 2 or 3 I'm sure that are from The Elder).  It's clear why they left them off, they sound like Dynasty or Unmasked just a little bit harder.  They fit very good on this one. I think the strongest is I'm Legend Tonight and a good second place goes for Nowhere to Run.  Down On Your Knees and Partners in Crime are good but merely fillers.<br /><br />The hits are really hits and as they were not able to release it as a double they could only release the big ones (only 8).  The songs are not reviewable cause you already know them, big hits like Detroit Rock City and R'N'R all nite are like untouchables.<br /><br />Japanese version has Escape From The Island and Shandi.  Very nice songs for the end of the 70's for KISS.<br /><br />All in all, probably the record company didn't know what was going to happen with the band with so much going on, and they hit the market with this one.  If you don't like very much the hits album, see it as an Extended Play and just skip the other ones.<br /><br />It's very important that you have to keep the count, this is the 4th time you buy R'N'R all nite and Detroit Rock City, it doesn't matter if it's live or it's the studion version or someone else play it with a flute is Rock'n'roll All Nite and with time you will have this songs endless times. Much more times than your Country Anthem.<br /><br />Highpoints: I'm a legend tonight.<br /><br />Lowpoints: Gene's hair (HAHAHAHAHAHAHA)
B000002UAI|5.0|The songs on this album were originally released in America on BEATLES '65 and BEATLES VI(6). Most,if not all,of the songs have been played on the radio in the UK,USA and other countries as well. Originally released in late 1964 in the UK only,Beatles fans there and in America were addicted to their music. They were teen idols gracing covers of teen magazines such as 16 and Teen Beat. Most,if not all Beatles fans knew the names of every member what instrument(s) they played. Many Beatles fans in America were Beach Boys fans as well(both artists recorded for Capitol Records in America). One well-known song on this album is ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC,originally recorded by the composer,Chuck Berry. The Beach Boys covered the song as well in the seventies. Also in late 1964,America saw the release of BEATLES '65,which most of the songs on this album are on. In fact BEATLES '65 was the Beatles' fourth Capitol studio album released in '64. That album was preceded by MEET THE BEATLES!,THE BEATLES SECOND ALBUM and SOMETHING NEW. Also that same year,came other Capitol albums with Beatles songs. They are THE BEATLES STORY,a 2 LP set,and THE BEATLES SONGBOOK VOL. 1 and VOL. 2,recorded by The Hollyridge Strings. Also,on the United Artists label,the soundtrack to A HARD DAY'S NIGHT,with Beatles recordings and instrumental recordings of Beatles compositions. Great album!
B000001IQH|5.0|This is an absolute classic punk CD. Anyone who listens to punk will have this CD in their collection. It fits my every mood, whether I'm happy, sad, or mad. PERFECT!
B000002UA9|5.0|The title of this review is the same as the very first Beatles album released in the USA. But in 1963,not many music lovers paid attention to the band. The cover photo is similar to the one on THE BEATLES 1962-1966,originally released in 1973. Now for the songs:I SAW HER STANDING THERE,appeared on the American MEET THE BEATLES!. Tiffany Darwich covered the song on her 1987 debut album TIFFANY as I SAW HIM STANDING THERE. MISERY and THERE'S A PLACE appeared on INTRODUCING THE BEATLES,released on the defunct Vee Jay label. The other eleven tracks,LOVE ME DO,TWIST AND SHOUT,ANNA(Go To Him),CHAINS,BOYS,ASK ME WHY,the title track,P.S. I LOVE YOU,BABY IT'S YOU,A TASTE OF HONEY and DO YOU WANT TO KNOW A SECRET? appeared on another American album,THE EARLY BEATLES,on the Capitol label.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I could not believe all the extra crap thrown into these movies.  I remember with great fondness waiting in line to see the originals in the theaters.  Back then you could buy a ticket and stay in the theater all day.  But with all the changes these are NOT the films I remember.  My younger sister and I could quote whole scenes, but not anymore.  To me the additions don't contribute anything significant to the films.  The changes seem to be little more than a gross endulgence by the very man who created the originals that we all grew up with.  I so loved the special effects in the original versions because they were cutting edge for their time.  Why the obsession with \\"improving\\" old films?  I am sorry I ever bought this set and I can see that there will be 1000's of used sets available.  I am very glad I still have the originals on VHS.  As I type this I am in the process of using my computer to preserve these classic versions.  Before you buy these DVDs I would encourage anyone to view them first. <br /> <br />And by no means should you ever, ever, ever get rid any copies of the originals you may have on VHS.
B00008H2LB|4.0|This album is VERY close to being all out perfect. Its such a breathtaking collection of nu metal/rap rock songs that, instead of coming off as cheezy (Like Limp Bizkit), defy the odds and make you wanna hear more. <br /> <br />Foreward...(An Intro, very short and very skipable N/A) <br /> <br />Don't Stay...(One Of my favorties. The Chorus is really catchy, but at the same time powerful. They Should have just done away with the foreward, cuz this would have made a killer intro to the album 9/10) <br /> <br />Somewhere I belong...(First single, and very catchy. Not The best on here, but in comparison to others in its genre, it might as well be God 8/10) <br /> <br />Lying From You...(This song REALLY grew on me. I thought the rapping about being \\"condescending\\" and \\"fitting in\\" was a little corny/cliche, but the chorus saved this one and made it WAY better with each listen 8.5/10) <br /> <br />Hit The Floor...(The most \\"Hardcore\\" on the album, in my opinion, but not my favorite. Again the chorus and Chester's screaming vocals save it from being sub-par hiphop 8/10) <br /> <br />Easier to Run...(I love the verses in this one. The singing is so beautiful, and the chorus is insanely catchy. Songs like this are the reason why this band has sold (15,000,000 as of last check) copies worldwide 9.5/10) <br /> <br />Faint...(Another Wonderful Song. Very Catchy, but unfortunatly like track 3, killed by radio 9/10) <br /> <br />Figure .09...(My Favorite on the album. Words cannot describe the feeling I got while speeding down an empty highway with this one pumping thru my speakers. Nuff said 10/10) <br /> <br />Breaking The Habit...(Experimental, I think. Different sound, but somehow it works really well. unfortunatly, radio and Mtv have gotten ahold of it, so get ready to mourn the loss of another casuality to \\"pop-radio\\" 9/10) <br /> <br />From The Inside...(This one grew on me because it was so damn catchy. I just couldn't stop singing the chorus. 8.5/10) <br /> <br />Nobody's Listening...(This, my freinds, is the song that kept LP from getting (My) 5 star rating. I Tried really hard to like it, but just couldn't. Eventually, the chorus stuck, but not without (a little too much) effort 5/10) <br /> <br />Session...(Filler track, nothing special N/A) <br /> <br />Numb...(The perfect way to end an almost perfect album. I love the chorus and the verses and basically everything about this song. Would have said it was my favorite at first listen, but now it falls as a (very) close second to track 8 10/10)

B0002IQHY8|2.0|First, let me say that this is NOT a \\"Project\\" album. Gone are Woolfson, Powell and all who made it a Project. Alan is on his own here. Very well engineered and produced but falls somewhat short in the delivery of the final product. I must say that this CD is disappointing. Not quite what I expected from AP. Only 9 tracks and two are redo's so actually only 7 tracks of new music. Not much for 3 years worth of waiting. The lyrical aspect is overly simplistic and not very catchy. Too many experiments on this to be able to follow what Parsons is trying to say. Instrumentals are hip and more in tune with what we have come to enjoy from Alan. Overall, he doesn't quite seem to know which path is valid but still wants us to follow him. I will follow him and hope that his next album find him on a clear path and off this rocky road that he seems to have found himself on.
B000002UB6|5.0|This album is great,that's why I gave it five stars. But the Beatles begin to \\"deteriorate\\" on this album. John Lennon recalled in an interview,\\"By the time we got to LET IT BE,we couldn't play the game anymore. We saw through one another and we intensely believed in the products we put out. Suddenly,we didn't believe anymore. We couldn't do it anymore. It came to the point where it was no longer creating magic.\\" Recording of this album commenced in January 1969 at Twickenham Studios. Yoko Ono,who Lennon would marry two months later,kept her future husband and his three fellow Beatles company during the recording sessions. To the delight of fans,the Beatles gave a free concert atop the roof above the Apple Records office. This is seen in the 1988 documentary film IMAGINE-THE DEFINITIVE PORTRAIT OF JOHN LENNON. Hits from this album include the title track(there a slightly different version on THE BEATLES 1967-1970),ACROSS THE UNIVERSE,GET BACK and THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD. TWO OF US,I DIG A PONY,I ME MINE,I GOT A FEELING and FOR YOU BLUE are cool. Production problems occurred after recording this album,causing a delayed release. Although ABBEY ROAD was the Beatles' very last recorded album,it was released before this one. The original pressings of this LP featured a red delicious apple instead of a granny smith(the sliced side is seen on side 2). In fact,this is the only Apple album that I know of with a red delicious apple on the label.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|It seems that a lot of people have hard feelings about the idea that this album was released as a Fleetwood Mac album to increase hype/ commercial potential, but the fact is, it's undeniable.  Come on folks, how can you be so blind?      It's no secret whatsoever that Lindsey pined for god-knows-how-many years over his never-released \\"Gift of Screws\\" album--he speaks of it himself on 1997's \\"The Dance\\" CD in the intro for \\"Bleed To Love Her\\", a song that was originally intended for \\"Gift of Screws\\" (as was \\"My Little Demon\\", which also turned up on \\"The Dance\\").  That was ALL the way back in 1997--now look here, over 5 years later we get the studio version of \\"Bleed To Love Her\\", & \\"Bleed\\" is certainly not the only track that dates back that far--\\"Red Rover\\", \\"Come\\", \\"Say Goodbye\\" (& more) were all originally intended for \\"Gift of Screws\\" & Nicks doesn't appear to be on any of them.  Additionally, it seems clear that certain of Stevie Nicks' tracks (most of them?) are solo project outtakes as well (or material she never may or may not have intended to use, but dug out for this project).  Now, don't get me wrong--if they want to put this album out under the name of Fleetwood Mac, that's understandable.  It's not like this kind of thing has never been done in the music business before--heck, one of Lindsey's idols, Brian Wilson, had an album intended to be released as a solo album with the title of \\"Brian Loves You\\" back in 1977, but, similarly, it ended up being released as a Beach Boys album retitled \\"The Beach Boys Love You\\".  Even in the Mac's own history, supposedly 1987's \\"Tango In The Night\\" was originally to be a Lindsey Buckingham solo album.  So, fine--they wanted to release it as Fleetwood Mac.      What really matters though is the quality, and quite a number of people really seemed to fall for the hype of \\"new Fleetwood Mac\\", because this is a very seriously flawed album.  Lindsey is EXHAUSTINGLY recycling his bag of tricks on here.  If you think what he's doing on here is \\"new\\", clearly you haven't been paying attention.  It's not that he doesn't have any worthwhile ideas on the album, however, the album finds Lindsey, to a very large extent, desperately trying to compensate for incredibly slight songwriting--he tries using an extremely dense, overcooked sound, & meticulous, painstaking arrangements--most blatantly, he annoyingly plasters extended, repetitive, \\"intense\\", show-off-y guitar solos onto TRACK upon TRACK upon TRACK--\\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" & \\"Come\\" both have interchangable solos at the end that go on for OVER A MINUTE on each track--\\"Miranda\\" also has a song-ending solo that's not quite that long, yet is ludicrously out-of-place.  Granted, he used this song-ending-guitar solo trick even on \\"Go Your Own Way\\" all the way back in 1977, but there, at least, he had a decent tune.  And that's a huge problem here--Buckingham does not have a solid foundation to work from on these tracks I've just mentioned, & his dense arrangements/ guitar solos come off as bombastic, & are an attempt to mask ultra-poor songwriting.  \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" features Buckingham singing/ mumbling in an unconvincingly \\"paranoid\\", tuneless way in the verses, & with \\"Say Goodbye\\", it's as if he's intentionally trying to make the vocal melody as dull as possible, & he rushes through the lyrics as if he's embarassed by them.  \\"Come\\" features, yet again, his annoying, \\"paranoid\\" singing of a basically melody-less melody, & he reuses his trick of having a super-quiet part with an ear-blastingly loud part--he did this type of thing to much better effect on songs such as \\"Tango In the Night\\" and \\"This is the Time\\", the latter of which is from his 1992 album \\"Out of the Cradle\\".  He also tosses in some speaker-hopping on the vocals, another one of his trademarks, as if that's going to help in this context.  \\"Miranda\\" is a super-weak track--it has his usual paranoid/ insecurity-themed lyrics head-scratchingly matched to a displeasing, upbeat tune that has him yet again reusing his \\"Big Love\\" riff, & tosses in an annoying, harmonized chorus.  So folks, this is NOTHING new for Buckingham AT ALL--if might be a shade less familiar if you tuned a total deaf ear to Buckingham's solo output, but unless you stopped paying attention to the Mac after \\"Rumours\\", this stuff should reek of familiarity, & in this case, it's a bad thing since he's using the tricks to annoying effect & to try & mask a painful roadblock in songwriting.  I don't have anything against his finger-picked/ arpeggiated, \\"Never Going Back Again\\"-style acoustic guitar playing, but the nice acoustic parts on \\"Come\\" & \\"Say Goodbye\\" end up getting smothered by all of the negative aspects of the respective tracks.  He does pull off one strong track in this vein--the manic, 6/8 time \\"Red Rover\\" is very hard to get a handle on, but it's arresting--it's a good showcase of his massively-tremoloed acoustic guitar, & it has an effective, soaring buildup, & he doesn't mercilessly drag the tune out.      On his remaining tracks, Buckingham does set aside his \\"insane\\" style in favor or a straightahead pop-rock sound, and he does come up with the catchy, nicely-harmonized \\"Peacekeeper\\", but there'a also the incredibly slight love song \\"Bleed To Love Her\\" (again dragged out with a long solo & additionally marred by that annoying \\"splat\\"-y drum sound or whatever it is), an incredibly slight \\"statement\\" with \\"What's the World Coming To\\", and the pleasantly listenable but rather dull \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\".    So, basically, Buckingham wasted a massive amount of effort with this, & by trying so hard, he actually ended up making things worse.      Thankfully, Nicks' tracks are more consistently pleasing--the arresting \\"Smile At You\\" actually jumps out at you--& she's in strong voice too.  Granted, Buckingham had heavy involvement on Nicks' tracks, but still, overall her tracks hold up way better than his.  He does give a nice touch to theenjoyable \\"Thrown Down\\", adding some dreamy guitar (along with some looping synth, yet another of his trademarks), & even the rambling, minimalist \\"Illume\\" is effectively moody & nicely anchored by the wavering-back-and-forth-between-two-notes chorus.  Still, her tracks are highly problematic as well, although at least they aren't so GRATING.  She didn't even write the music for \\"Running Through The Garden\\", yet it still manages to start off sounding like a clumsy, washed out version of the previous tune, \\"Smile At You\\", & overall, it's a generic, unexciting uptempo track with Lindsey, yet again, trying to lift it up with his \\"thrilling\\" guitar soloing.  The title track, an upbeat love song, is also dull, additionally marred by the annoying children's chorus-vocals at the end.  \\"Silver Girl\\" is nicely tuneful, but there's no denying that musically, it sounds like \\"Thrown Down\\" at a slower tempo, & then \\"Destiny Rules\\", another ear-catching tune, sounds like \\"Thrown Down\\" again, this time at a slightly quicker tempo, & it's quite rote & marred by some weak lyrics.  The closing tune, the dull \\"atmospheric\\" \\"Goodbye Baby\\", ends the disc in weak fashion.      All that said, this is an enormous mess of a \\"comeback\\" album, & by putting the Fleetwood Mac tag on it, I think a lot of people got brainwashed.  This isn't even close to a great album.  With Buckingham badly out of control, & Nicks in rather rote form, the album, despite the occasional bright spots, is very much a chore to get through.  It adds insult to injury knowing that Buckingham has better material from what was to be his \\"Gift of Screws\\" album--the ballad \\"Down on Rodeo\\", for instance, is clearly better than many of the tracks that he DID include on here.  Unless you're a total Buckingham worshipper, or a die-hard Nicks fan who's extremely forgiving of Lindsey's indulgences, it's absolutely incredible that anyone would love this album.
B000002UDB|5.0|This was one of the best-selling albums of 1968. In fact,this is the soundtrack to the Beatles' third film. Seven of the eleven tracks appeared on THE BEATLES 1967-1970,originally released in 1973. The title track is cool. BLUE JAY WAY was inspired by a Los Angeles street. George Harrison recalled in an interview that he and his wife visited L.A. while on their honeymoon. At the time of recording,he was married to Patti Boyd(this marriage was his first). Paul McCartney wrote some cool tracks for this album which are YOUR MOTHER SHOULD KNOW,THE FOOL ON THE HILL,HELLO GOODBYE and PENNY LANE. John Lennon wrote I AM THE WALRUS and STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER to name a few. BLUE JAY WAY was written by Harrison. Great album!
B0002TSZK6|5.0|I have been a registered Republican since I first voted at age 21 (that's how long ago it was -- you had to be 21 to vote!). There have been a number of things about this administration that have been troubling me, however, so I have been giving my vote this year a lot of thought. <br />My advice to every voter is to see this movie before the election and evaluate the facts for yourself. This is important. You owe it to yourself, this country that we all love, and future generations. <br />Some people that I know talk about this movie as if they are afraid to see it because they think they disagree with its premise. Any reasoning person can differentiate between the facts presented in this movie, supported by documentation, and the filmmaker's forays into editorializing. Michael Moore is not going to hypnotize you into changing your mind -- that is up to you once you have honsetly reflected on what is presented here. <br />This is no year to vote on \\"auto-pilot\\".
B00003CXCT|4.0|I have been a HUGE Star Wars fan since I was seven years old and I saw the first movie in the theater. I always count Star Wars (New Hope) as my all-time favorite movie, hands down.  Anyway, when the trilogy was released, I must admit that I was VERY disappointed that the movies contained the newer versions of the films rather than the originals.  I cringed when I saw the remade version of New Hope...when Greedo shoots first, that is SO lame....it really takes away from the scene. I was hoping that the trilogy would contain only the unchanged versions of the films and was sorely disappointed to find that they are indeed the new ones. Boo!!  If it ain't broke, why fix it??  Why would they take a movie as classic as Star Wars and add changes to it?  It isn't as though the movie was not well loved by its fans. More people than not have expressed dissatisfaction with the changes.  The only people who seem ok with these dubbed in scenes seem to be kids who didn't grow up with the original versions.  ANYWAY, this is the reason I gave this trilogy 4 stars instead of 5. I almost gave it a three but being such a fan of the films, I couldn't actually go that low because I still love these films. I hope that eventually they put out the ORIGINAL, untouched films so that true fans of the movie can enjoy the film the way it has always been.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|How come does a band this bad get signed??? I seriously cannot understand. This music is trash!!! I am not kidding you, this album is ultra distilled garbage. Not even one song is good. I cannot believe the hype.     Highlight: Helps MTV survive.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I saw the first movie in the series , now called \\"Episode IV, A New Hope\\" I think three times when it first came out - some people watched it dozens of times- and found it to be very entertaining, lots of attention given to detail. In style it was sort of old time Saturday Serial which George Lucas admitted at the time was deliberate. I can't remember now if I've seen the next two in the original series beyond bits & pieces on TV but they were similar in nature from what I've seen. <br />Some say these earlier Star Wars movies are the best of the bunch, better than the current ones, I would venture to say that they're about the same- the differences being mainly better FX now (and I think the originals were revolutionary for their times)and maybe a slightly different style. <br />This set should've been released years ago, I've forgotten Lucas' lame excuse for not doing so. I can understand cleaning up or even upgrading the special effects as was done in the '97 theatrical re-release but I don't get changing some of the things that have been redone. How did those guys manage to mess up the sound on that one movie?, that should never have happened! <br />The fourth disc in the set should be very interesting, that will help take some of the sting out of some of the \\"improvements\\"
B00004XONN|5.0|Stepping into this cold reclusive world may be uneasy at first, but stick around and an unforgettable musical journey will unfold before your ears. This is a true example of the courage and self dedication it took to make this remarkable album. Radiohead pushed aside all expectations and came out with an unexpected work. Kid A is worth owning if not for the sheer bravery it boasts than its take you into another world song spectrum. Take care and enjoy the music
B00003CXCT|5.0|THIS DVD RELEASE IS GREAT!!THE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY BLEW ME AWAY.EVERYTHING LOOKED AND SOUNDED CRISP AND DETAILED.NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CHANGES.JABBA THE HUTT IN EPISODE 4 LOOKS MUCH BETTER THAN HE DID IN THE 1997 RE-RELEASE.HAVING IAN MCDIARMID AS THE EMPEROR IN THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK WAS MUCH NEEDED.IT GIVES CONTINUITY TO THE CHARACTER THAT WASN'T THERE BEFORE.ALTHOUGH, I DO HAVE ONE ISSUE WITH THAT SCENE.THE EMPEROR TELLS VADER THAT LUKE IS HIS(VADER'S)SON.VADER ASKS \\"HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE\\".DIDN'T VADER ALREADY KNOW THIS ORIGINALLY? THAT LINE MESSED UP THE PLOT JUST A LITTLE,BUT OVER ALL I ENJOYED IT.HAVING HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN AT THE END OF RETURN OF THE JEDI IS A CHANGE I DON'T UNDERSTAND,BUT I'M NOT AGAINST IT.DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME,I CHERISH THE ORIGINAL RELEASES VERY MUCH.I HAVE THEM ON LASERDISC,AND WOULD NOT DREAM OF PARTING WITH THEM.BUT I REALLY FEEL THAT A LOT OF STAR WARS FANS ARE SERIOUSLY OVERREACTING TO THE CHANGES.THEY DON'T CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT.IT IS COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE WHY MR. LUCAS WANTED TO DO THIS.IT DOESN'T MAKES SENSE TO HAVE THE BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS AND SOUND IN EPISODES 1-3,AND THEN HAVE EPISODES 4-6 COMPLETELY OUTDATED.EVEN THOUGH I DISAGREE WITH THE PURISTS,I DO RESPECT THEIR OPINIONS.THIS DVD PACKAGE IS CERTAINLY WORTH THE MONEY.THANK YOU GEORGE LUCAS!!!
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Ray Charles was a one-of-a-kind artist who always did things his own way, whether you liked it or not. M. Gavaghen's review pretty much sums up my opinions on this, his last effort. All I would like to add is directed to the few \\"one star\\" guys who wrote reviews just because they thought they were being cute. First, you weren't funny. Second, show some respect. If you become half the man Ray Charles was you'll be doing something. Frankly, I don't think you'll make it.     Goodbye, Ray. You'll be missed.
B000002C1W|5.0|Please don't listen to the idiots who say that this album is bad because one artist over another is better... that in itself is ridiculous.  I listen to this album along with The Division Bell more than anyother Pink Floyd album!!!  The music here is so much more complete, it just has that ability to put you into a trance where all you want to do is sit and float on air for a while.  I spend hours listening to these two albums and I wish I could find another artist who performs as well as they do. <br /> <br />My personal favorites have to be learning to fly, and from the division bell - poles apart, mainly for the awsome guitar that is performed on these two tracks.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This moving starts with a man that has nothing and goes out to do whatever it takes to get what every man dreams of : the money, the power, and the girl.  This movie has it all drugs, guns, gangs and drug dealers, blood and gore, and non-stop action.  What more could you want?
0060277270|5.0|According to Amazon, this is the 335th review posted on CS Lewis's first book in the Chronicles of Narnia series, so I would only make one observation.  My son, not quite five years old, listened to the story of how Aslan the Lion allowed himself to be killed in the place of others and then rose from the dead.  I then asked him, 'Who else did that?'  My son then smiled and said, quite of his own accord, 'Jesus.'  That is the power and the value of C.S. Lewis's storytelling.  We can't wait to read the other six Narnia books!

B00005JLWN|3.0|This movie can be summarized as 1984 meets The Matrix. It certainly invokes the Orwellian world as well as the visual anime style of The Matrix. However, what makes this movie so unique is the way how the world of Equilibrium is being protrayed as so \\"white\\", so \\"anti-septic\\". Everything looks so clean. Of course, one could not ignore the big television screens, the \\"Father\\" figure, the grammatron clerics as the embodiment of the thought police. <br />Since 1984 has been made and remade quite a number of times, the addition of a kung-fu style, \\"gun-kata\\", utilized by the clerics would only add to stylistic updadte of such visited and re-visited material. <br /> <br />This DVD edition has certainly excellent transfer. I had the good fortune to compare this with the region 2 copy and found that the picture quality in this region 2 DVD is sharper and clearer. Audio-wise, they sound the same. The only differences were probably the trailers and the tv spots. In this edition, it's the UK version is the better one. Besides, the UK region 2 DVD also includes a \\"jump to fight\\" feature.   <br />

Prof. Eco weaves an amazing yarn that imbues medieval history (the 12th century crusade, the sacking of Byzantine, Frederick the Great's death) and the fantastic (the numerous flora and fauna of the land of Prestor John). <br /> <br />Absolutely mesmerizing. As with Eco's previous novels, be armed with a history encyclopaedia, it helps in understanding some of the backdrops and narratives. Relax, kick back your slippers and enjoy one of most thrilling medieval fantasy novel you will ever read. <br />

B0002XVQNU|5.0|It's usually a shame to realize that when you watch a film, the product brought to the screens was not the originally intended version meant for audiences, but due to the pressures of the film companies, the directors are often forced to remove certain things from the film in order to speed things up or even to shorten the running time. <br /> <br />I guess that's the reason DVDs were invented, to allow us a chance to view what was removed from the original film or even allow the directors the chance to put back into the film what they originally wanted to be in there in the first place.   <br /> <br />This in itself can be double-edged because it all depends on whether or not the deleted scenes add anything to the original film or not.  sometimes upon viewing the deleted scenes you can see why the scenes was shortened or deleted outright in the first place because it was not necessary and didn't add anything to the film as a whole.   <br /> <br />I myself am looking forward to this new director's cut version of Daredevil.  I loved the way the film was initially, but upon hearing that there were things removed from the film, it got me quite curious as to what the film would be like with the deleted material reincorporated back into the film.  I'm definitely looking forward to this, and will definitely add this to my collection.
1577311523|5.0|I wasn't thrilled when my brother loaned me this book as I'm not really into \\"new age\\" or feel good type books much.  But, I was pleasantly surprised.  It reminds me not only of the Vajrayana Mindfulness practice, but also of the Dzogchen practice of Togal.  This is one of the highest practices in all of Tibetan Buddhism.  Yes, it also reminds one of Baba Ram Dass' classic work \\"Be Here Now\\" which is much more pictorial than this book.  But, this book is a lot more practical with instruction on how to practice.  I don't know how advanced Mr. Tolle is, but this is a fine book, well worth reading and practicing too.  I'd probably give it 4.5 stars, but decided to round this one up to 5.  After all, it doesn't talk about Trekcho! (the other main Dzogchen practice).  In any case, this book is written simply and is quite straightforward.  You don't have to be an expert or guru to get value from it.

020530902X|4.0|The best aspect of this book, considering its size, is that one can carry it in their purses or pockets at all times with ease.  It is great for quick reference and less wordy than some of the other books that I have read on this subject.  However, at times it can be too simplistic.  In retrospect, it is great reading for all people who need information in a hurry and cannot afford to spend a great deal of money on reference books.  Considering its affordable price, it should be in every writer's professional library.
0385336810|5.0|I'm not a reader type of person; however, this book was absolutley fantastic. All of Kinsella's books are funny and entertaining. I could not put this book down! I read it in 3 days! If you want an entertaining book read this one! I guarantee you will enjoy it. I was laughing every minute of the story.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Basically, the best movie of all time.  No, but seriously it was awesome, dont listen to the critics.  Insanely good, awesome plot, acting, love story, everything is great.  I watch it every day of my life.
B00005JLWN|5.0|When I first watched Equilibrium I was in complete awe. I had never seen anything like it before. The story, characters, and the all important character development makes the viewer care about the rising action in the movie.Thecover of this movie says \\"Forget the Matrix\\", and I agree 100%. The matrix was highly predictable, with little to no character development, and is actually, to me worthless to watch.  In contrast to Equilibrium, the main character evolves in a world that he can physically change, as opposed to the matrix when Neo \\"evolves\\" into the one.. nothing really changes...he simply stops some bullets and makes a phone call, oh and he makes out with Trinity.. which I am sure is highly compelling to some people, but to me, I was looking at the screen (never saw this in the theater) and said... and.. what else?? The action and the emotional development in Equilibrium is very compelling. We have a father, a soldier, and a person, all being torn apart by an emotion-inhibitory drug. The plot is very clear, and very direct. Unlike the matrix whose plot is very thin, very \\"mysterious\\" (I didn't seem to think it was), and not based on the characters, but more on the visuals.  I will take a good story over special effects any day of the week.  The music is also a very good reason to check out equilibrium.  It doesn't try to be hip or cool (like the matrix), but adds a sort of strength to the action, instead of an action scene (lobby scene of the matrix in which one is waiting for the main characters to start dancing.  Overall, Equilibrium is a completely different movie than the matrix, because it deals with human emotion and character development and it's effect on society, instead of \\"wow, like whoah.. it's my destiny to be the like second coming of the one....and I choose to do absolutely nothing, but make more sequels with plots that lead absolutely nowhere. If you haven't seen Equilibrium.. Buy it! Watch it! Don't compare it to the matrix, but if you do, remember, Equilibrium deals with characters, and The matrix deals with the special effects that are supposed to replace the characters and their development.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|This movie pulled out every cliche you've ever seen.  The \\"run after the departing girl at the last minute\\" cliche was done not once but three times.  The film used old pop music top-forty hits to establish moods in a very heavy-handed, distracting, and unimaginative way.  And, in addition to being insultingly anti-American, the movie was so male-oriented, it was almost misogynistic.  Most of the female leads played paid servile employees of their male lovers.  The women in this film NEVER say \\"NO\\" to male attentions even if the woman just married someone else.  And female employees flirt with their bosses by turning their office chair towards him and spreading their legs as widely as possible.  This movie has all the subtlety of a pile driver but is far less interesting to watch.
B000000WF0|5.0|From the sweeping majesty of Bittersweet Symphony to the haunting Drugs Don't Work and the quite wonderful Lucky Man, every song on this CD works magic. Richard Ashcroft's songwriting is quite wonderful. The Verve were destined for an early burn out, the band couldn't contain Ashcroft's talent (and ego). I recommend everyone who has ever claimed to like Brit Pop and refer to Blur when they say so to put down Parklife and switch onto Urban Hymns. The Verve put rock, indie, classical together and work it into a fusion the likes of which I've never heard. <br /> <br />Pure genius.
B00005JMJG|4.0|Eternal Sunshine is a waky movie with a great cast. It's good to see Carrey in something where he's not talking out of his butt.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is one of the best thrust metal albums of all time. Who ever gave this album a low rating you need to think about some things. A read some of the reviews and I was disgusted. Some idiots said that the vocals are bad cause they have no feeling. Think about it, the name of the band is SLAYER how do you expect feelings out of a band that wants to cause destruction. By the way slayer isn't a black metal band they are a thrush metal band. If you think the vocals are bad then I guess you haven't listened to Megadeth yet. Some of you guys are stupid, if you don't like this type of music then of course you aren't going to like it but if you do like this type of music and you don't like it then something is wrong with you. <br /> <br />On with the review: <br /> <br />1. Angel Of Death - 5/5 The cruelest song I have ever listened to. <br /> 2. Piece By Piece - 4/5 This is an awesome song, It makes you realize that you are in hell, where this Cd is supposed to take place  <br /> 3. Necrophobic - 4/5 Can you play any faster then this? I wish it was a bit longer   <br /> 4. Altar Of Sacrifice - 3/5 Don't you love their song title?   <br />5. Jesus Saves - 3/5 So Freaken Fast <br />6. Criminally Insane - 5/5 The chorus makes you feel like you are in hell and satan is talking to you, amazing   <br />7. Reborn - 4/5 Fast that's all I got to say   <br />8. Epidemic - 3/5 God Damn do they ever slow down   <br />9. Postmortem - 4/5 Crazy lyrics and ofcourse...FAST   <br />10. Raining Blood - 5/5 The first time I listened to this I was like...wait did they just do that?? The whole CD builds this song up so well and when you hear that thunder and the rain you know you're officially in hell <br />11. Aggressive Perfector - 4/5 So much better then the original (On Haunting The Chapel)   <br />12. Criminally Insane (Remix) - Well I don't know which one is better the remix or the original
B0001CCXY8|3.0|I really wanted to like TWS. I've never been a big CC fan only because I have limited knowledge of all their CD's. From what I've heard, you either love or hate CC. After listening to this album I can't really say that I feel either way. The album is truly not as brutal as I expected and the lyrics are childish. There are about 3 decent tracks that stand out above the rest but over all, the album is just average. I guess if you like CC than this is vintage CC but I'd rather listen to Behemoth or Belphegor. I like the deep vocals but not the screams and the songs are boring after a few spins. There are bands that are more creative and talented out there. If you like you're Death/Gore Metal basic and the lyrics simple, Cannibal Corpse is for you! As for me, I like this album but don't love it and I have so many metal CDs that it's either going to collect dust or I'll sell it back after I give it a few more spins.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Times change, feelings change, styles change!! Slipknot didnt sell out they just went into the studio and recorded what they were feeling. They arent a death metal band, Death metal sucks! All those bands sounds the same. Just really fast, Same beat, Really heavy screaming lyrics that you cant understand unless you read the lyrics while listening to it. Corey Taylor knows how to write deep lyrics and at the same time deliver them, Something that other bands cant combine(Megadeth: awesome lyrics but sound like crap when Dave sings them) The guitars are awesome in here they definatly worked more on them then any other CD they made. The drums are the focus of the band anymore like their other works. This CD is the evolution of Slipknot from being a cold killing machine to being a cold \\"Calculating\\" killing machine.
0684800713|5.0|Ernest Hemingway's book The Sun Also Rises is a remarkably thought-provoking story that is very skillfully written. Through his use of short, factual sentences, Hemingway describes the actions of his colorful characters. These, in turn relate covert sentiments and defining characteristics of an entire era, that is, the post World War I era. The story revolves around Jake Barnes, an American expatriate who is left impotent due to a war wound. Therefore, his love of Lady Brett Ashley is crushed, even though deep mutual love exists. They met while she, as a VAD in the war nursed his wounds. Brett as she is called throughout the novel suffers through several brief affairs. Jake and his friends are among the Lost Generation, who, scarred by the war, have lost hope, spiritual belief and their sense of purpose and direction. Thus the group also including Robert Cohn, a Jewish Princeton lightweight champion, Bill Gorton, an American writer and fellow expatriate and Mike Campbell, Brett's fiance spend most of their time drinking in the cafs of Paris and at the Fiesta in Pamplona, Spain. <br /> Hemingway, through this book depicts the anxiety and disorientation of the Lost Generation. He shows the men and women, just coming of age at the end of the war, who are driven to immoderate drinking and a devil-may-care attitude in order to avoid expressing their feelings of the war. Hemingway also exposes his readers to issues such as the abuse of Jews resembling that of Robert Cohn, the effects of excessive drinking and even the brutal realities of Bullfighting in Spain. Though, Hemingway also provides hope for this generation because amid the despair and heartache, the sun also rises. <br /> I would recommend this novel to all fans of Hemingway and his revolutionary style of writing as well as to anyone interested in exploring a post war novel with moving themes. Though, I would also caution all who are intolerant of profane language.
B00005JMJG|5.0|The first time I saw this on DVD I liked it, but not as much as some of the other reviewers here. After viewing it for the second time last night I fell in love with this film and I think it is one of the best of the year so far and a soon to be classic. The plot is so wacky the first time you see it that it becomes distracting, but during the second viewing everything will make perfect sense. I hate romance movies, but this one really makes a joke out of the genre by creating a smart and realistic look at love and the cost it has on one's life. Jim Carrey is great in this low-key role and Kate Winslet really nails her part as well. This is Kaufman's best screenplay yet and should get him an Oscar win in that category. This one is worth buying and should at least be seen by all those interested in an original movie that you rarely get to see now days unless Mr. Kaufman is the one behind it.
0679722610|5.0|Red Harvest is less well-known than its more famous Hammett brothers, The Maltese Falcon and the Thin Man. It may well be my favorite, but it would be really hard to choose. Hammett is one of the greats of detective fiction and his work has both defined and exceeded the typical genre boundaries.<br /><br />Red Harvest (1929), like many Hammett novels, is as much about the corruption of place as it is about a particular murder mystery. The mining town of Personville/Poisonville comes into the life of the Continental Op when he gets stood up by a potential client, and becomes the focus of his efforts to clean up corruption in the town when that client is killed.  The book is actually structured as a series of linked smaller stories about the town, but instead of providing obvious divisions, this structure lends the book a complexity which compliments (rather than undermines) the unity of the whole.<br /><br />Red Harvest is as tough and dark as a reader could want without falling into self-parody. Hammett has a distinctive crisp and clean writing style which makes the pages fly by faster than the reader would want them to. A must-read for fans of Noir and hard-boiled detectives, a should-read for pretty much everyone else.
0684857820|5.0|To reviewer \\"Johnny Dodds\\" (example for what is wrong with our culture, August 15, 2004)     No my friend...An example of what is wrong with our culture is lack of humanity. The rapist is an example of this as are you.      You're sick of PC BS??? Whaaaa! How's this for not being PC?  I wonder how you'd feel about rape if you were sodimized by force you big jerk?!? What if it had been your mother? Sister? Someday daughter??? I can't believe a neandrothol like yourself even reads.    As for the \\"kid's review\\"...Well honey, life's tough...Maybe you shouldn't read books like this one without your mom's ok. It most  certainly doesn't have a G or PG-13 rating. Maybe the thought of it seemed intriquing but the reality was too much to take. When you're a big girl maybe you'll be able to handle it.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The matrix trilogy is alittle better, but these are very close seconds.  The first one is great, and well come on its directed by Ridley Scott, and it started this whole thing, come on theres nothing like the original, but...  Then theres the second one which is the best in my opinion, more action, better performance from ripley, just as scary.  Then theres 3 and 4 which are good but not great.  The first 2 are undeniably masterpieces, if only 3 and 4 had better directors like Scott and Cameron.  9 out of a 10.
B00011RPB0|2.0|Like SEINFELD was advertised as a \\"show about nothing\\", this is \\"a movie about nothing\\". No matte how delicate and tender Sofia's direction was, the movie left me with no impression at al.. It dows no touch deeply Japanese culture; I've seen a lot of better movies dealing about middle-age crisis; the redeeming factor is really Bill Murray, who makes the best with hat is offered to him with the silly script.<br /><br />This movies seem to have achieved cult status. Alright, the girl was unhappy, Bob Harris was \\"moderately\\" unhappy,. thei love was impossible, the movie did not play it cheap, did not make them sleep together, and that was a merit. But I simply go bored wiht people singing karaoke in Japan for 90 minutes...
B00003CXCT|5.0|Well, I enjoyed the set.  I bought it the week it came out, just like all the other Star Wars sets that have come before.  I have the original set from the early 80's, the letterbox version, the re-release version of the mid 90's, the special editions and now the DVDs.      I have three versions of The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones on DVD, let's not go into all the other Star Wars stuff I just can't seem to part with in 20+ years of collecting ect, ect....    Suffice it to say, I am a huge Star Wars fan.  Oh yea, and I am a mid-30 year old gal.      With all that in mind, here is my humble review.    I loved the set.  It was crisp, clear, clean, the picture is absolutely gorgeous.  The soundtrack is so clear, you can't hear any distortions.  If this is what we have been waiting for all these years, fine with me!    The Bonus material is really cool. There are a few documentaries, specials & TV commercials.  I loved watching the old trailers. I remembered them as soon as I saw them!  Very cool.  I wish they had added the older CBS docu-special that they did in '79 or '80 with C-3PO & R2-D2, my taped copy is in really bad shape.  That is fun to watch just to see them bickering.      I haven't seen them all, but I have seen two so far.  Well worth the price of the set on their own.        For the changes:    1.  The Emperor/Vader scene in The Empire Strikes Back -  I think it flows a bit better.  And having Ian in the scene is much more believable.      2.  Biggs scene in Star Wars:  A New Hope.  It's a bit out of place since you don't see the friendship with the two developed a bit more.  I believe the only way to see those scenes are on the Insiders CD-ROM of a few years back (and the novel).  So I was able to piece that together in my mind, but I suspect that the new fan or someone who was a casual viewer might go, who is that?    3.  The biggest change of course is Hayden replacing Sebastian Shaw.  Okay, I'll admit it, this was the one and only time I cringed for a Star Wars update.  I thought why?  But, I have to eat my words.  It *worked*.  I liked the effect.  Now, I will say they should have gone a step further:  Where is Qui-Gon?  If they went as far as changing out Sebastian, where is Qui-Gon?  hmm?  you know, the guy who found our little bundle of midi-chlorians?  But back to Hayden, the effect was believable, it looked like he was there back in '83.  Do I miss Sebastian?  No.  Why? I have 4 prior sets of VHS tapes that are mine forever to watch when I want to see the big guy.  More Star Wars to watch and enjoy.    Nit-picks:    I want the added scenes.  Where is Luke on Tatooine fixing the vaporators, hanging with Biggs?  Yea, I listened to the commentary for Star Wars, I heard what George said.  Bonus disk, Bonus George...  I want the sandstorm scenes in RoTJ, I want R2's run in with a wampa...  At least they are on the CD-Roms, but still.  I am very greedy.     Let's face it, these movies were written and released 20 + years ago.  Qui-Gon and crew were not yet around, so George is attempting to tie the whole series together.  I think he is doing a good job at it.  The changes flow, they don't leap! out at you saying, hey I'm a new scene, yoo hoo!    The reason they seem that way to most older fans is simply because we are used to seeing the movie a certain way for over 20 years.     People reading this may wonder why on earth I am happy there are all these changes.  I remember the 80's, after 1983 when Return was out. I remember all the years when Star Wars was done, gone and pretty much forgotten.  There were the West End game books, and that, folks, was it.  One thing I would get so upset about is you could find book ater book on Star Trek, nothing on Star Wars. It was pretty pathetic for the Star Wars fan.  Then the mid 90's came, Timothy Zahn and the new movies.  Star Wars has been back ever since.        At the end of the day, would I like to have the older versions?  Sure. But, I am of the opinion the more Star Wars the better.  So, in my mind, George, thanks!  Bring it on, new & old, updates & special.  The more Star Wars from the Father of the Force, is fine by this Star Wars fangirl.
B00030590I|5.0|Hero is one of the most magnificent foreign films to come out in a very long time. In fact, I haven't found any I quite liked since Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which you can't help but mention when discussing Hero). <br /> <br />Jet Li (y'know, the famous action dude) stars as the warrior Nameless, who was left without parents when he was very young. In the opening of the story, he is summoned to the Emperor to gather his rewards for killing three wanted assassins: Sky (played by Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung, of In The Mood For Love), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung, of The Soong Sisters). There is also Broken Sword's young apprentice, Moon (Zhang Ziyi, of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). But as the story develops, you learn there are many secrets being hidden. This is the type of film that tells the same story several times, only different in each version. Everyone has a different idea of what has happened. <br /> <br />The great thing about this film is that the ball gets rolling right away. As opposed to Crouching Tiger (which I did also like), there was not much character development. But in spite of this, you will still feel for them all and feel very attatched to certain ones. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both pull off amazing performances. I also love to watch the two of them fight. Leung is very precise in his movements, almost as if (as mentioned in the movie) he is writing calligraphy as opposed to fighting. Cheung moves very gracefully and is dressed in robes with long sleeves, which paints a beautiful portrait. Her fighting techniques almost seem to be dancing with swords rather than out to kill. <br /> <br />This film is highly recommended to any foreign film lover, any action film lover, and any Zhang Yimou fan. Zhang is one of my favorite directors, and this is an all-time masterpiece.
055357342X|3.0|I like to read series because once I find an author to my liking, one novel just seems to end too quickly. I purchased the first three novels of \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" because I read a suggestion that said if anyone liked Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series - try Terry Goodkind's \\"Sword of Truth\\" and this George R.R. Martin's series. I loved \\"Wheel of Time\\" & \\"Sword of Truth\\" but I am at a loss for the connection to this series. Though it is a very well written story about knights, kings, deception, betrayals and plenty of injustice & death, there is none of the MAGIC as in the other series and thus, in my case, it is not the fantasy of my choice. I would not recommend it to someone just because they said they liked the other 2.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Go get this CD!  It is awesome!  It has both their traditional punk rock which is always awesome and some more slow music which is also awesome.  It's not like any of their other albums before.  It's also very opinionated, but you can decide whether that's a good or bad thing.  I really don't care!  All I know is that this is one heck of a rock opera and a must-have for any Green Day fan!
B00005JNEI|4.0|As I am writing this review, there are 1122 other reviews already posted of which 239 carry only 1 star (lowest rating). HOWEVER, after reading through (almost) ALL of the negative reviews, which range from \\"overexaggeraited\\" (is that a word?) to \\"manipulative propaganda\\" to \\"fake facts\\" [SIC] to \\"LIES, LIES, LIES\\", I am YET to find a SINGLE negative review that lists either the supposed \\"fake facts/LIES\\" or detail the \\"manipulation/propaganda\\".    To illustrate my point, here is what Ray Sallan \\"Ray\\" writes on Sep/28/04, which represents a typical negative review in a nutshell:  \\"Anyone with a google search engine and a half a brain can figure out that most of what's in the movie is utter crap.\\"    Well Ray, if what you are saying is true, why NOT share those google results with all of us??    And most galling to me is that someone actually has the guts to write the following (again without listing a single \\"manipulation, \\"fake fact\\", or \\"lies\\"):  \\"If you are an independent thinker, and are educated in world affairs and politics [SIC], you will see this for what it is..........an ultra-left wing money-maker for Michael Moore. Pass on this one.\\"  [Review by Boonville Jim on Oct/3/04]      Indeed, IF you are an \\"independent thinker\\" and do care about the next election, you ought to see this movie for yourself and then DECIDE where the truth lies about 9/11, the Iraq war, and our culture of fear.
B000000OSE|5.0|I write this review for the Gn'R fans who were converted by \\"Appetite...\\", because I know your dilema and you're probably the only ones thinking of picking these albums up now.  You LOVE 'Appetite', but are weary of buying these albums because of the mixed reviews.  You really don't know if it will hold up to their first album.  Well, let me tell you right now, IT DOES NOT.  Not by a long shot.  But that doesn't make uyi I and II bad albums.  It just means that appetite (I don't want to use '' anymore so get over it) was (and still is) THAT GOOD.  Don't go into these thinking that. <br />   That being said, let me be the first to tell you to GO BUY UYI I at least.  This album has more of the fast paced rock songs and loud screaming you crave.  Songs like The Garden of Eden, Don't Damn Me, and Perfect Crime just make you wanna thrash around violently, whereas Don't Cry and November Rain will make you wanna hold up your lighter even in your bedroom.  Please forgive You Ain't the First, I know I try to.  It's the only \\"eh\\" point in the album for me.  I, personally, love the cover of Live and Let Die and will even go so far as to say it's better than the original (did he just say that?  Oh yes I did.   mmmm, sacrilage).  It rocks harder, anyway.  Sorry Mr. McCartney, go cry on the shoulders of all the millions of Beatles fans.  Dead Horse has one of the best screams I have ever heard which then segues to one of the more powerful solos by Slash.  You could tell Axl was dealing with some demons.  When he sings sometimes it just sounds painful. <br />   While we're here, lets talk about Axl for a second, seeing as no one else is (BURN!!!!).  He was really trying to take his voice somewhere else on these albums and make it more dynamic.  Say what you will about Axl, there were few who were greater.  I am not a big fan of all the things he has done, or for that matter, what he is doing (or supposedly doing) with the band.  He was one of the best front men of all time.  WAS.I'm a Gn'R fan, but I'm also a realist.  The original band is DEAD.  And, quite frankly, I'm glad.  Let Axl beat the perverbial \\"dead horse\\".  He, unfortunately, could not keep the demons at bay.  If the original band got back together, they would have to prove to me it was not about money.  I am tired of keeping the flame alive.  Time to move on, both in life and in the review.  I am very sorry, but I had to vent my rage and profess my disdain for the way the things have gone with this band in a public forum.  Moving on. <br />   Double Talkin' Jive is a pretty cool song, made only cooler by an IZZY SOLO!!!  YEAH, IZZY!!!  Bad Obsession just has a nice groove to it, as well as a very cool slide intro by slash.  It's also a nice break to have a song where Axl isn't SCREAMING IN YOUR F***IN' EAR.  Then you get November Rain. <br />   Now, not many people know this, but when they were starting to work on Appetite, they were first thinking \\"Double Album\\", but, it's not cool to have your major label debut be a double album, so songs like don't cry and you could be mine (uyi II) were held back, as well as November Rain.  They (well, mostly Axl) worked on this song to make it right FOREVER.  Finally, it was released on this album, and it's pretty f***in' good.  It's an epic done right.  Just that vision of slash on the piano at the end of the video playing that KILLER outro is a staple in rock music history.  Great arranging as well. <br />  So, if you don't have any Gn'R albums, please don't buy this one first.  Go get appetite.  That is the s**t.  If you have Appetite and want more from this band, get uyi I THEN get II.  Well, get Lies before you get either of I or II.  I don't doubt that there are some, or possibly many who don't like this album, and I can see why.  It is Mos Definately worth a try.  Go get this album, you'll either love it or have a general malaise for it (i hope i used that word right.  Trying to grow a little, ya know?).  I think it's pretty damn good.  five stars, no doubt. <br /> <br />A little note:  If I got ANY of this information about the band wrong, PLEASE, I urge you Izzy, Slash, Duff, Steven, Matt, or even Axl to hunt my e-mail down, send me a message and correct me.  It's only right.
0739432176|5.0|For those of you who feel that dragons, unicorns, and bards are a bit overdone nowadays, this fantasy trilogy offers up a heroine who binds the dead with a bandolier of bells. The Geography of Death is lovingly delineated, from the prologue where Sabriel is born and dies and is rescued from the First Gate of Death by her father, to the third book in the trilogy, where the new Abhorsen braves Death in the form of a river, a waterfall, pools of black water, strange currents that suck the spirit from the flesh.<br /><br />Sabriel herself is an English schoolgirl, recently graduated from Wyverley Academy with a \\"first in English, equal first in Music, third in Mathematics, seventh in Science, second in Fighting Arts and fourth in Etiquette. She had also been a runaway first in Magic...\\" A visitation from the Dead sends Sabriel on a quest through the magical Old Kingdom, in order to reunite her father's body with his spirit which is trapped within the Fourth Gate of Death. She has to do battle with a really nasty necromancer-Adept, and rescue a prince who is a bit of a figurehead at first but who finally develops into a memorable character in his own right. Sabriel is both helped and hindered by a very non-cuddly cat named Mogget.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" is the middle book this remarkable fantasy series.  If I ever die and go to fantasy heaven, I hope it resembles Nix's immense library beneath glacier and mountain, where each door opens into a separate mystery.  In the catacombs beneath the library, Lirael discovers how to turn herself into an ice otter or a barking owl, reads \\"The Book of Remembrance and Forgetting\\", and duels with the monstrous Stilken.<br /><br />However, \\"Lirael\\" isn't just about Lirael.  Prince Sameth, heir apparent to Sabriel as the Old Kingdom's champion against evil necromancers, also comes of age in this volume.  There are plenty of evil necromancers to go around.  In fact, at the end of this book, it appears as though they are winning the war to turn the Old Kingdom into a kingdom of the dead.<br /><br />\\"Abhorsen\\" is a direct continuation of \\"Lirael,\\" with the ex-assistant librarian and her companion, Prince Sameth carrying on the battle against Hedge and the evil he is digging up at Red Lake.  Although Prince Sameth was meant to be the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, heir to the powers of 'The Book of the Dead' and the seven bells, Lirael now takes up that role, and Sam seeks his destiny as a descendant of the mysterious Wallmakers, who built the barrier between the magical Old Kingdom and the mundane kingdom of Ancelstierre.  The two will need all of the magic they can conjure up against an enemy that threatens not only the Charter, but all living beings.<br /><br />The swirl and cross-currents of life gradually ebb as the dead pass through gate after gate on Garth Nix's nameless river--a river like Styx or Lethe that runs through each of our subconscious underworlds as a legacy of our water-bound gestation.  It is an eerie experience to remember that journey of birth--only this time in the wake of the dead--in this marvelous fantasy trilogy.war to turn the Old Kingdom into a kingdom of the dead. <br /> <br />\\"Abhorsen\\" is a direct continuation of \\"Lirael,\\" with the ex-assistant librarian and her companion, Prince Sameth carrying on the battle against Hedge and the evil he is digging up at Red Lake.

B0002BO0AS|1.0|Hmmm, what is this ? Unearth is terrible and i dont see why people find their music, good or even interesting? Its generic,unoriginal, horrible riffs and you kno what? it's not even heavy. If your into mainstream crap then buy this but for people that can apreciate better music? Look else where !
B0002O06N0|4.0|If you like your blues infused with a little White Stripes and Jimi Hendrix, The Black Keys is the group for you. Rubber Factory is an amazing album-- rough, raw, sexy, bluesy. I haven't been this excited about a group I \\"discovered\\" since I got into The White Stripes. Interestingly, The Black Keys is also two-member group from the Midwest. And something about The White Stripes, The Black Keys....there's an odd symmetry there in the names... <br /> <br />When I popped this CD into my car stereo, I almost peed my pants with excitement, I was so impressed. This duo, this album...is truly a revelation. The Black Keys are amazing because their sound is at once nostalgic and fresh.  <br /> <br />I feel the album lost some of its \\"oomph\\" after the 6th track...but I was listening to it on my car stereo, driving around, my tummy bothering me. I have a feeling that in the proper context, with the proper audio equipment doing its thang, I'd feel differently. All I know is that this album should be played loudly and often.  <br /> <br />Oh, and I'll be frank: I find this album sexy as hell. The lead singer has a great, sexy voice and has a fair amount of soul for a white boy. Throw this on when you wanna seduce your wo/man. It won't do you wrong.  <br /> <br />4/5
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|Asf is as i would call it?Mediocre at its best. I mean, they may be influence by some great 80's band but their sound is far from metal and more like pop punk  or some (...) like that. Avange seven fold's  \\"waking the fallen\\" has nothing good about it and whats worse ? The production. As a fan of bands like iron maiden,children of bodom,archenemy , old metallica, i  think waking the fallen is  as crappy as it gets and not even close to metal. Dont bother!

1400031354|5.0|Mr. Smith does it again! And this time round its better than the first book in the famous Botswana private eye Mma Ramotswe and her No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. Set in Botswana, Africa, Mr. Smith weaves a simple yet extraordinary tale of simplicity, love, roots and a dash of mystery.  <br /> <br />The essence of Africa is beautifully captured in a simple 227-page read that ends even before you've begun to savor Africa's aromas and tastes. After reading the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and Tears of the Giraffe, I've had the yearning to drink the bush tea that is spoken about constantly in the book. I might want to add that you must read its predecessor before tears of the giraffe - as both the books are interlinked and entwined as the river is to the sea.  <br /> <br />Something about the plot now: We are treated to various mystery cases in the course of this book. An American mother wants to know what happened to her teenage son in the Kalahari Desert and why did he disappear from the face of this planet. A butcher wants information on his wife and her on goings with another man. There are more tales that give this book its beauty of language and the craft of writing.  <br /> <br />Mr. Smith takes us on a roller-coaster ride through Africa - its people, their beliefs, the simple life they still lead mingled with technology and new-found ideologies. Africa - in the heart of the world is an unusual place - full of brightness and brotherhood.  <br /> <br />We are introduced to Mma Makutsi (Mma Ramotswe's secretary) in a new avatar of a junior detective and her first case.  We are further lead to Mr. Maketoni - the fianc of Mma Ramotswe and the problem of the orphaned children he has to take care of. Will Mma Ramotswe take the children in? Will the American mother find her child? Read this awesome book to find out... <br />

B00008WT5M|5.0|This was my 1st AC/DC album and is second to For Those About to Rock...  There is a lot of power in this one and there is not a weak track.  Are You Ready and Rock Your Heart Out are the best songs.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I am an avid reader of Anne Rice, especailly her vampire chronicles which i reread over and over agian, This movie is a beautiful and haunting rendetion of her book \\"Interview With The Vampire\\"the first in the chronicles. Tom cruise did and excellent job of capturing lestat perfectly.Kirsten Dunst really shows her range as an actress at such a young age in her protrayal of the child vamp claudia and Brad Pitt's sadness and despire through out the movie is shown masterfully. FYI: way better then the hack job of a film QUEEN OF THE DAMNED, although stuart townsend was a appealing version of lestat :)
B000002J09|4.0|This is probably the 6th greatest rock album ever, behind Tommy(The Who, Who's Next(The Who), The Wall(Pink Floyd), Back in Black(AC/DC), Quadrophenia(The Who) <br />(Nobody appreciates good old fashioned hard rockn'n'roll that bands like AC/DC, Van Halen, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Def Leppard, Rush, and Guns'n'Roses) <br /> <br />1. Black Dog(10/10) This a great song that is powerful in ever possible way.  <br />2. Rock & Roll(9/10) Also great like the last one, amazing drumming, vocals, and guitar, not to mention John \\"Johnny Boy\\" Paul Jones' bass.  Gets boring if listened to too many times. <br />3. The Battle Of Evermore(8/10)  Kind of weak but amazing, this song is about Lord of the Rings.  It is very cleverly done.  <br />4. Stairway To Heaven(100,000/10)  This is the greatest rock song ever.  The guitar solo is also the best in its category and the only other solo that even compares is Eruption by Van Halen.  John Bonham is beating the Jesus out of his drums.  <br />5. Misty Mountain Hop(7/10) vastly overrated but still good. <br />6. Four Sticks(6/10) weak <br />7. Going To California(7/10) ends the stretch of bad songs  <br />8. When The Levee Breaks (9/10) great song, amazing drumming. <br /> <br />Not enough bang for the buck, i've seen this sold for $19.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is not the kind of movie that you play when you want adventure, fun, deep interest, easy watching, etc.  In other words, it is not a movie for the impatient or for those with a short attention span. <br /> <br />The visuals on this are spectacular, but I also enjoyed the voices.  I like the low-key effect it all had; most of the movie is relaxed and low-key. <br /> <br />The plot is simple, and unfolds slowly.  If you've read this far, all the other reviewers have no doubt given away the plot, which is a shame.  Part of the fun of watching this movie is trying to guess what is really happening to the protagonist. <br /> <br />The animation reflects the dreamy pace beautifully.  If you get bored with (or lost by) the monologues, you can just lean back and watch the way the pictures unfold in front of you.  Artists especially should take note of this movie.
0064407667|1.0|I have seen the \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\" books all over the place, they have been NY Times bestsellers, and my son's last book order had the first book listed--so I thought I would buy it for my kids to read. I figured it would be great to get them started on a new series, and since it was being promoted by Scholastic, it MUST be quality--right? <br />  <br />Well, I have to say that I am APPALLED by \\"The Bad Beginning\\". I can see the author was trying to emulate such notable authors as Roald Dahl, but he is the equivalent of a stick figure drawing trying to emulate the Mona Lisa. I found no redeeming qualities in this book--on the contrary, I found about 90% of it to be repugnant and repulsive, with highly inappropriate innuendoes. References to Count Olaf's shiny eyes make him sound for all the world like he's on drugs. Count Olaf's forcing of his fourteen-year-old adoptive daughter to marry him smacks of pedophilia and sexual abuse, as do the threats from one of Count Olaf's minions to Klaus that Count Olaf is going to \\"give\\" the boy to him, to do what he wants with. <br /> <br />Even if children do not pick up on these sick and twisted concepts, there are still plenty of overt situations that are horrific--like tying up Sunny, taping over her mouth, and dangling her in a bird cage from a second story window for two days (didn't the world watch aghast when Michael Jackson, just held his baby out over the edge of a balcony?). And then there are the threats all through the book that Count Olaf is going to kill the children as soon as he gets their fortune. <br /> <br />The thing that disturbs me the most is that adults in the book are either totally evil and amoral, or they are completely ineffectual. In essence, the book portrays the children as entirely alone in a cruel, despicable world. Bad things are going to continue to happen to them, and no one is going to help them. If the children are to survive, they will have to take care of themselves. This is NOT the kind of world view I want my kids to have! I am sure the author was trying to portray the childen as capable of taking care of themselves, as being strong and independent. However, even in this he fails miserably. Wouldn't strong, independent, intelligent children confide in the neighbor who just happens to be a judge? Would strong, independent, intelligent children sit in a tower all day long, doing nothing, while their baby sister sits just a few feet away, trussed up like a chicken and dangling out a window? It just doesn't add up. <br />  <br />And now I see they are making a movie out of this grotesque trash!!! I honestly don't undesrtand why this book is so popular. I am passionate about books and reading, and it is very rare for me to decide that a book should NOT be read; in fact, I have only felt that way about one other book in my whole life (and that was NOT a child's book). I read \\"The Bad Beginning\\" from cover to cover, looking for SOMETHING that would make it worthwhile. But the only thing I can say about it is the author has a good writing style--however, it is totally WASTED on the subject matter.  <br />  <br />I have always been sickened at the idea of book burning and censorship, but I have to admit, all I want to do with this book is bury it in the muckiest part of my garbage can.   <br />
B000060MMI|4.0|Flogging Molly is somewhere around a 3.9 star band in my opinion... Drunken Lullabies is a great song, and i like the very,and I mean very,Irish sound to teh bands work...I actually think Druken Lullabies is the best album, it also has the best album cover...while reh songs are rather alike the style of music heard here is very original and that makes up for it somewhat...not particularly heavy themes here, mainly the cruelties of life and the ale to fix them...they dont call Ireland the land of the drunks without reason....
B0002TKOYG|5.0|Same as the other one, only cheaper.  This CD is amazing, how could they keep this one from the US market?  Oh well, thank god for imports.  If your a fan, buy it NOW!!
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I really think that many reviewers missed the boat on this one.  C'mon, it was shtick, was old Hollywood, and there were numerous \\"moments\\" that everyone seemed to miss. <br /> <br />Did you see the \\"Bacardi Bat\\" the first time Dracula transformed?  Am I the only person who laughed when I saw Dracula's helpers and said, \\"Look!  It's evil Ewocs!\\"?  (That's obviously what happens when ewocs turn to the Dark side of the Force!)  I had a blast watching this movie.  To enjoy this movie you have to watch it knowing that it was a tribute to the old Hollywood Movies, that Dracula was over-the-top for a reason (I loved the fact that he was so over the top!), etc. <br /> <br />My only complaint with the movie was the last segment.  They went a little too far in the end with the unbelievability and that burst the wonderful bubble they had built.  Personally, I hope they make another one - without that kind of an unbelievable ending.
B00005JMEW|4.0|What makes this film work is the fact this it IS an over the top genre collision.  Non-Stop action from beginning to end, with the violence pushed to unbelievable, making it easier to take and making this BBBBad in the very good sense of American slang.<br /><br />QT barrowed from the best, turned it on its ear and made something very new and refreshing out of it!
B00006DEF9|5.0|Skipping past a review of the film-it being #10 on the AFI Top 100 films speaks for itself-I just have a few comments.  Wonderful transfer, full of details that I have never seen before-just look at Donald O'Conners face the first time Kelly says \\"Dignity-always dignity\\"!  The extras are wonderful, and it was great to see the early musical numbers from their orginating films.  My only minor quibble was that they did not include the early Technicolor reprise of \\"Singing In The Rain\\" from \\"Hollywood Review\\", although the earlier version from the film with Cliff Edwards is here.  Perhaps that is because it is in one of the documentaries here, although edited.  A unpromoted surprise is the ability to access additional historical material during the film if you click the film reel in the lower right corner of the screen.  Rare material from \\"Show Girl In Hollywood\\", Robert Montgomery singing \\"It Must Be You\\" from \\"Free And Easy\\", and John Gilbert making his talkie debut (in technicolor!) in \\"Hollywood Review\\" is all here.  It is amazing to see him here, just months before the collapse of his career.  Very poignant.  This feature can be switched off, of course.  Grab this edition, by all means!
B0001ADAVK|4.0|A well crafted and well acted story with several messages put forward in both overt and suble fashion.  Worth the viewing!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome Dove is a classic western based on the novel of the same name by Larry McMurtry.  Lonesome Dove tells the story of two former Texas Rangers, Captain Augustus McCrae and Captain Woodrow F. Call.  When one of their old friends shows up telling how beautiful the Montana territory is, they decide to drive a herd of cattle all the way from the Texas border on the Rio Grande to Montana.  Along the way, the Hat Creek Outfit and its herd must deal with renegade Indians, sandstorms, horse thieves, countless rivers, long periods of time with no water, and much more.  This has always been one of my favorite movies, not just a miniseries or western.  The movie blends great characters, a perfectly interwoven story, and plenty of action.  Remaining very true to McMurtry's epic novel, Lonesome Dove does not shy away from showing things like they really were.  By the end, characters you have come to love have died.  This is a can't miss western that will please almost all moviegoers. <br /> <br />  What makes Lonesome Dove special is the casting, from its two main leads all the way to the bit supporting characters.  Robert Duvall was born to play the part of Captain Augustus McCrae, the wise-cracking, lazy, ladies man.  Gus has too many great lines throughout the movie to even mention.  Tommy Lee Jones is perfect as Captain Woodrow F. Call, the hard-nosed, no nonsense, Texas Ranger.  The chemistry between Gus and Call provide many of the high points of the movie.  The excellent supporting cast includes Danny Glover as Josh Deets, the tracker/scout for the herd, Diane Lane as Lorena Wood, a sporting woman who goes along on the drive, Robert Urich as Jake Spoon, the smooth talking, card playing friend of Gus and Call, Frederic Forrest as the renegade outlaw Blue Duck, D.B. Sweeney as Dish Boggett, a love sick cowboy, Rick Schroeder as Newt, the young cowboy trying to become a man, Angelica Houston as Clara Allen, the love of Gus' life, Chris Cooper as Sheriff July Johnson,and Tim Scott as Pea Eye Parker. <br /> <br />  The two-disc DVD offers a decent looking fullscreen presentation, interviews with Lonesome Dove author Larry McMurtry and executive producer Suzanne de Passe, cast and crew information, production notes, a trailer for the miniseries, and an interactive western trivia game.  It goes without saying that if you're a fan of the movie, check out the novel.  This is one of the few movies where you can say the movie was as good as the book.  For a classic western with a great cast, fantastic story, and plenty of action, check out Lonesome Dove!
B00005JMX6|3.0|Given that \\"The Girl Next Door\\" isn't trying to be anything more than a modern-day \\"Risky Business,\\" it's at least halfway enjoyable.. Elisha Cuthbert does a good job of looking yummy (she's not nearly as annoying here as the character she plays in \\"24\\"), and the villain of the movie is a lot of fun, but the main actor (Emile Hirsch) is kind of a dud. Granted, his character is supposed to be a bit of a loser at the beginning of the movie, but even when he's supposed to NOT be a loser, he's still without any screen charisma. If you compare his performance to Tom Cruise in \\"Risky Business\\" (and how can you not, really?), Tom Cruise was a loser, but right from the start you liked him. Emile Hirsch just doesn't have that... <br /> <br />My main problem with the movie, though, is that it the whole message is supposed to be how Emile Hirsch is so in love with Elisha Cuthbert and sees beyond her \\"Porn Star\\" past to the real person inside.. when she considers going back to doing porn, he tells her \\"You're better than this.\\" and later she asks \\"Why do you believe in me so much?\\" That's all fine and well, but at the same time, it seems like there's nothing really to her character beyond the fact that she's really, really hot looking and that because she' s so good-looking, her being with Emile gives him all this status and power that he didn't have before. I mean, what is it that he likes about her aside from the fact that she's really sexy and he loves having a sexy girlfriend? What else is there to her character? Before he had a porn star girlfriend, Emile didn't get any respect from anyone at the school. After he starts dating her, all the jocks and everyone are really jealous of him and so he feels more confident and takes more risks in life. So, yeah, I can see why he likes being with her and would do all this stuff to keep her with him instead of letting her go back to porn. But is that really supposed to be love?  <br /> <br />\\"The Girl Next Door\\" has some funny bits (when they go to the dinner for the scholarship speeches, the sex education film they show at this school, and maybe a couple of other moments that I can't recall) but a lot of it is really kind of dull, due to a weak lead actor, and the \\"message\\" of the movie comes across as insincere, at best...
B00005K9LN|5.0|this one is really good. this one's what number of the beast was for iron maiden, back in black was for ac/dc
B000005HO0|4.0|It shouldn't work. It really shouldn't. Terrible sound quality, sloppy playing and loud simple music. When compared with more sophisticated black metal such as Ulver or Burzum, Live In Liepzig is ridiculously cheap, crude and muddy. Euronymous' solos sound more like a pneumatic drill than a guitar. Dead has next to no range whatsoever. Even Hellhammer is hardly on top form. So yeah, it shouldn't work. But somehow, I don't know how, it does.<br /><br />For those who don't know (though if you're reading this, I find that hard to believe), Mayhem were one of the most important bands in Black Metal. Certainly not the best, but one of the most important nonetheless. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, a studio release containing most of the songs found here, is seen as a legendary benchmark for black metal. Seeing as, if you're reading this you're probably new to Mayhem and are deciding which album to start with, I'm mostly going to compare this De Mysteriis, which I've already written a review for.<br /><br />First off, De Mysteriis is definately the better produced. Better sound, better playing and generally more accessible (if such a word could be used about Mayhem). On the other hand, it has Atillia's vocals which are the worst black metal vocals I've ever heard. He really does sound that bad, and I can't believe Mayhem thought he was worthy of recording with them. In fact, I can't believe any black metal band would consider him worthy of picking up a microphone. Also, this album is brimming with energy. De Mysteriis is perhaps more atmospheric, but if you want atmospheric black metal then Mayhem aren't really the band for you, so I'd go for the energy. I've never heard a live recording sound more violent and hate-filled.<br /><br />In reality, if you're prepared to spend the money and you like black metal (i.e. you already have some black metal albums, seeing as anyone really into black metal would have bought these years ago), I'd recommend you buy both, if only for the comparison. But if you can only buy one, then, for all its short-comings, I think I'd recommend this first.<br /><br />Its also worth noting that there some mp3s from both albums available on the bands official website, so they may aid you in your decision.the comparison. But if you can only buy one, then, for all its short-comings, I think I'd recommend this first. <br /> <br />Its also worth noting that there some mp3s from both albums available on the bands official website, so they may aid you in your decision.
B00005JL3A|2.0|Hollywood's latest contestant in the video-game-cum-feature-film sweepstakes rears its head in the form of Screen Gems Resident Evil.  Originally Evil was in the hands of zombie guru George A. Romero but ultimately it was not to be, and his latest foray into the zombie arena was momentarily halted.  Currently Romero is in pre-production on the 4th installment of his popular `Dead' series. That aside Resident Evil liberally culls its plot and look from the popular PlayStation discs, classic zombie flicks and Alien-type sci-fi.  But alas Anderson's Evil disappointingly brings very little to the horror fans table.  <br />Is the film all bad? Well, no. On the contrary, the cybernetic sets are slick and well conceived, as are the gored-up, out of control zombie dogs. The script is a notch above par and the soundtrack features music by Crystal Method, Static X, Slipknot and Marilyn Manson. However strong these attributes are they hardly rescue this release from being more run of the mill, teenage drekk.   <br />Fans of Lucio Fulci and/or George Romero's zombie epics will find little redeeming in this sanitary picture. It's appalling that Hollywood can screw up such a simple formula. There's no need for convoluted plots or deep subtext. Merely start with some dead bodies and a gung-ho group of survivalists fused with radiation or good old-fashioned voodoo and you've got yerself the makins' for a zombie marathon. Oh, and you can't forget the blood, lots of blood.  <br />Resident Evil was rated R for \\"Strong Sci-Fi / Horror Violence, Language, Brief Sexuality / Nudity.\\" Taking the latter first, there was only one fleeting glimpse of a female nipple and some sex-under-the-sheets-in-a-flashback-with-a-strobe-light type of crap. Next up is \\"Language.\\" I recall but one \\"F\\" word and I'm quite sure that many a youngster has spewed-forth much worse while blasting the contaminated undead in the comforts of their parents' homes. Finally the \\"Strong Violence\\" - the handling of this aspect distressed me as I soon found that these zombies hardly bled at all. Yep, a near blood-free zombie pic. In the film's defense they did attempt to explain this by saying, \\"the blood coagulates only after the body is dead.\\" Fine. So now we should see blood clots and splats rather than streams and pools, but we don't. What we see is a whole lot of nothing.  <br />Furthermore, the fast action scenes (i.e. minions of zombies being massacred by 3 people) are obscenely influenced by the stylistic renderings of the MTV age. Any gore that may have been present in these sequences is completely blanketed in an overkill of rapid-fire filmmaking tricks and stunts. So while it may come as a surprise to all 4 (count `em!) of the producers, the jittery camera pans, quick editing, flickering lights and extreme close-ups just make for one unpleasant mess.  <br />It's a sad fact that the video game is more compelling, more fun and a helluva lot bloodier than its cinematic offshoot.  <br />Note: The film's star Milla Jovovich may have experienced some dj vu as she awakens towards the end near naked on a lab table, just as she was at the start of The Fifth Element. Bruce Willis co-starred in The Fifth Element and awoke to a similar predicament in Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys. All roads seem to lead back to Bruce Willis. I don't like that. <br />By: Christopher Curry
B00006BNDI|5.0|Burzum truly was one of the most incredible black metal acts around. While Mayhem concentrated on playing as quickly as possible while Darkthrone felt that the worse production the better the album, Burzum created something infinity more timeless, emotional, bleak and harsh. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is perfect proof of this.<br /><br />Dark, cold and stirring music, few black metal bands have managed to create atmosphere like Varg has here (the only band I can think of is Ulver on the magnificent Bergtatt, though they did it in a different context). Rarely is music so simple and sloppy with in-your-face distortion so emotionally affecting. And in case that sounds like a bad thing - it isn't. If this were played by music scholars it would sound bland. If it were produced in a proper studio, it would sound dry. As it is, I've rarely heard an album so bleak and atmospheric.<br /><br />Det Som Engang Var is a mid-paced epic with haunting melodies and Varg's tortured screams. I don't know what he's screaming, but I don't really want to know. He conveys what he's feeling so well that I don't need to. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss and Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen are faster tracks, though they still clock in at around 8 minutes each. Despite their more aggresive nature, they're still dark, icy and stirring in their own way. The album finishes off with an epic synth track, Comhet. Its simple and repetitive, but then it couldn't be anything else. Its proof that Varg doesn't need to turn up the distortion and scream to create a mood or catch your emotions.<br /><br />Along with Det Som Engang Var (the album), Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is essential black metal. If you're new to the genre then it may be hard to digest, because compared to the stereo-typical view of black metal (eg, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas or Transylvanian Hunger) Burzum is rather genre defying. But anyone with an open mind looking dark, epic, emotional and bleak black metal needs this album.
B00006J3WH|4.0|when i first heard that Buffy was going to have a musical episode i was apprehensive because most of the cast (minus Anthony Stewart Head and James Marsters) had no musical talent that i had seen.  But then when i saw the episode i loved it.  Of course ASH was great, as i expected, but Amber Benson (tara) was also quite good.  their duet (\\"i'm under your spell/standing (reprise)\\") was so good.  Sarah Michelle Gellar was also suprisingly good.  myt favorite songs were \\"going through the motions\\", \\"under your spell\\", \\"rest in peace\\", \\"standing\\" and walk through the fire\\"   the only song i think is not good is \\"i'll never tell\\" sung by Xander and Anya.  neither Nicholas Brendon nor Emma Caulfield have very good voices and it is a very campy, rather annoying, song that is far too long.    all in all this cd is well worth buying and is great to listen to.
B00003CXXP|4.0|In the not too distant future, robot manufacturers cook up an experiment, a robot that can love. A prototype, David (Haley Joel Osment) is given to a lonely couple to be their `son'. A simple `imprinting' ritual makes him love the mother, Monica (Frances O'Connor). This is a bit of a problem as robotic love, it seems, is not prone, like its human equivalent, to fade or corrode. And Monica will only last another 50 years while David might last forever. Not that David needs to wait 50 years before things get very tough for him. <br /> <br />When this was first released, about three years back, it didn't sound like my cup of tea and a lot of critics panned it. So I never got round to seeing it till now. And well, I cannot but admit, it's really pretty good. There's no denying that Spielberg rather spoils things at the end: the last 15 minutes or so descends into credulity-defying hokum and sentimentality. But, that aside, it's a very interesting, original, intelligent and in places rather beautiful, science fiction film. Osment is extremely impressive in the lead role. It's intriguing and fairy-tale-like and probably, if you've not seen it, the less you know the better about how the story develops. Suffice it to say that if, like me, you've been avoiding this one, it is well worth relenting, as I did, and giving it a try.   <br />

0679720200|2.0|The Stranger by Albert Camus was an extremely montonous book.  I did not like Camus's view of life in general.  This novel is an existential novel.  Therefore, Camus wrote this novel from some exerience and about his views on life.  In the novel Meursault is a very laid back person.  His views on life are very simple.  He does not think that humans have any reason here on earth, and does not see the point in even making an effort to connect with people, believe in something that he came see or touch, or even mourn about his mother's death.  Meursault felt that it was all irrelevent in his life.  I was not expecting what happened at the end of the book.  I did not like this book to start out with, and I thought I had the whole novel figured out when I came to the climax of the story.  Camus suprised me though, and I do admire him for his writing style:  the simplicity of the text.  It was different and like no novel I had read.  Even though I did not thoroughly enjoy this book, I do reccomend it to everyone, because I think everyone should experience Camus's writing style and his view on life.

Next time you're in a bad mood, pop this in and sing \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\" You'll feel like a giggling fool in no time.<br /><br />However, the ending truly leaves something to be desired. I'd like to edit my raview to take a star off, but it looks like I can't do that.
B0002IQHY8|3.0|Yes, this definitely has an electronic sound, it's a new sound for Alan Parsons.  If you don't like electronic music, then you might have a problem with this.  Personally, I like electronic music okay, and I don't see anything sacrilegious about this CD.  There are three tracks that I particularly like.  Mammagamma 04 and A Recurring Dream Within A Dream are both overhauls of classic Alan Parsons tunes.  I wouldn't want a whole CD full of retreads, but I found these two changed enough to make them sound fresh again.  The other track that especially sticks with me is the last one, Chomolungma.  This is probably the least electronic sounding track, but is very proggy and in fact sounds to me like something that should have been on Pyramid.  I like Pyramid a lot, and I like this track.  Aside from these three tracks, the rest of the sounds less inspired but not unpleasant to me.  I call this CD not a great effort, but a pretty good one on the whole.
B0002858YS|4.0|when i picked up this album i was expecting to hear the same old new wave retro rock stuff that the record indutry has been flooded with the last few years. i was wrong. this  band takes all the great aspects of the new york hipster bands, throws in some danceable rock riffs, and puts it to some of the best written songs i have heard in a long time, this is the best band i have heard since the stokes, and anyone who is into that type fo music will love this album, buy it today!!!!!
B00012FXB8|4.0|Although much-maligned by critics and fans alike, Alien 3 is a worthy movie that was hampered by all-too-high expectations raised by the unbeleivable first two movies.<br /><br />(Potential spoilers, but only things revealed in the beginning of the movie). A lot of the critisism that I have seen aimed at this movie stems from the fact that Newt, Ripley's surrogate daughter from the second film, was killed off.  Be realistic people, this movie was filmed six years after the second, there was no way of bringing back Carrie Henn, and killing her off was a much better proposition than casting a different actress.<br /><br />I really have no idea why this movie is so despised.  Although how an alien (or multiple ones) got onboard the Sulaco is shoddily explained at best, the plot is strong thereafter.  Ripley is in a decaying former prison, where there are no weapons because there is no where to go.  Ripley must overcome disbeleif and then fear as she tries to rally the hardened criminals into a fighting force (a fighting force armed with axes and scissors no less) and stop the alien.  There is also the added element of the ominous company trying to apprehend the alien and use it for their own, diabolical purposes.<br /><br />The sets on the dark, barely-functioning prison world are as good as anything seen in the first two films, and the acting may be the best of any movie in the series (there is no overacting Veronica Cartwright, underacting Winona Ryder, and the sometimes over-zealous Weaver seen in the second-film) and the music is good, if not great.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection is the cancer of this series (well I suppose now that dubious honor has shifted to AVP), watch this film and enjoy it for what it is: a worthy and altogethor different entry in a great series.  It should be noted that the original movie is by far the better of the two versions.  Although the \\"Director's Cut\\" adds some interesting angles, shots, and ideas, the plotting is nowhere near as good and I sincerely reccomend the orginal<br /><br />Original: 7/10<br /><br />Director's Cut: 5.5/10ar as good and I sincerely reccomend the orginal <br />Original: 7/10 <br />Director's Cut: 5.5/10
B00005JMUA|4.0|In a continuation of a story first told in first volume, director Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill vol. 2 is a tale built on revenge, love, and family. The story begins in the same place as its predecessor: in that El Paso wedding chapel where the villainous title character (David Carradine) left his nameless prot -assassin (Uma Thurman) with a bullet in her head. From here, Thurman's character, âthe Brideâ continues on her quest to hunt down those responsible for this shameless act and repay them through their own death. Woven around the scenes of revenge, Tarantino weaves back story. Explanations of why the Bride and her wedding party where objects of a team of assassins anger, why the Bridewanted to kill Bill, and what happened to the child the Bride was carrying at the wedding chapel.<br /><br />  Tarantino builds Vol. 2 around his trademarks: dialogue and music. This helps to provide us with the exposition and the kind of quiet down moments missing from Vol. 1. Here, the characters stop to talk, and Tarantino has written some witty repartee that brings even more sophistication to his sophisticated commingling of your basic film noir and \\"woman scorned\\" melodramas with Sergio Leone-style spaghetti Westerns, blaxpolitation flicks of the 1970s and kung fu flicks of the '80s. This combined with Robert Richardson's cinematography makes this film outstanding, you can get lost in the sumptuous and varied beauty of his photography. Moving back forth between movie present and movie past allows one to understand the angst shown by Thurmanâs character in the first volume. While containing some violent and some down right frightening scenes, Tarantino uses flashbacks to breakup the violence and explain how certain circumstances arise or are overcome.<br /><br />  While the first volume was a bloodbath, volume two ends up being a story of love and family. It could be seen as a story of a woman overcoming great odds to settle a number of scores and bring together a family.a family.

0345350499|5.0|I am an aspiring historical \\"fantasy\\" writer myself with a particular interest in Arthurian lore.  \\"Mists\\" is my favorite book of all time and I read it at least two or three times a year to remind myself of that fact.  I've worn out three copies of it. <br /> <br />It's not the historical accuracy of it that makes a difference.  I KNOW it's not necessarily historically accurrate, but then neither is the Arthur tale itself.  And Ms. Bradley is inconsistent in some of her writing, and not all of it is particularly original even if it is lyrical. <br /> <br />HOWEVER... <br /> <br />If you take this is a bard's tale, which I have, and accept it for its flaws, which I have, this book tells a woman's story.  Plain and simple.  In most Arthurian books, the women are portrayed as evil, incestuous witches (Morgaine), selfish adulteresses (Guenivere), or victims (Igraine).  Ms. Bradley's work, historically accurate or not, is simply another point of view.  She never meant it to be a bible for anyone, and I don't think she meant it to be taken as a history book.  It's a good story and although I was mildly annoyed at Arthur being portrayed as somewhat of a ninny, I understand where she was coming from when she did it. <br /> <br />The religious aspects of this book, I think, are a devise.  The true point is the journey a woman goes through in life, from \\"maiden\\" to \\"mother\\" to \\"crone\\".  Morgaine and Gwen mirror each other in their journeys as they deal, each according to their beliefs, with the changes of view that come with going through life and dealing with its changes and difficulties.  The male characters, Arthur, Lancelot, the Merlins, Accolon, Mordred, are meant to be perifery characters in this book, on purpose.  Like the religion, they are mere devises, focuses of conflict, for the women to overcome.  Put in that perspective, it makes their sort of \\"non-involvement\\" understandable. <br /> <br />Taken strictly as fiction, as it is meant to be, \\"Mists\\" is a beautiful,lyrical tale told from a unique point of view and with an ending that should, in peoples' minds, reconcile two diverse beliefs into one - a suggestion where \\"goddess\\" worship, if it ever did exist, really went.  It doesn't matter if there was ever a \\"Great Goddess\\" religion in Britain (there almost certainly was one in other parts of Europe at one time).  All that matters is that it's a good story. <br />
B000244EMO|4.0|In a completely different extra-terrestial experience than the Alien movies, Director John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzenegger (in a role perfectly suited to him) offer an engaging blend of action and science fiction.<br /><br />The movie begins in a totally different way than it ends, which works rather well.  The first thirty minutes of the movie follow Major Dutch Schaeffer and his team as they are dropped into the Central American jungle to deal with a group of guerrilas.  Unsurprisingly, they emerge completely unscatched but utterly annihilate the rebels, with a suitable amount of exploding grass shacks and Arnie one-liners.  However, after they set back to the pick-up zone, things really start to heat up.<br /><br />The team slowly begins to be whittled down by an unseen foe, and as the commandos's plans to stop it become increasingly desperate, they grasp that their stalker is not human.  McTiernan wisely limits almost all sight of the Predator until later in the movie, making it an extremely effective villain, even more so at the conclusion when we see what is behind the Predator's mask.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly solid, from the nervous Richard Chaves as Poncho to the geeky Shane Black as Hawkins (with his supply of jokes that always seem to involve his girlfriend's netherparts) and Sonny Landham as the all-knowing tracker with an acceptance of his fate.  The jungle setting is brilliantly filmed, and the sound effects and music are both superb<br /><br />Predator is not Alien, and the two movies are vastly different.  Don't try to compare them, just enjoy Predator and its solid action sequences.<br /><br />8/10
B00005JNEI|5.0|Some of the stuff in this film is a little over hyped, but it is an excelent documentry!!!! All the people who rate this one star is obviously a total Bush supporter who does not have an open mind. Bush uses Joseph Goebells (Hitler era) type of propaghanda so why can't anyone else?  This isn't propaghanda though its the truth. So if you don't have an open mind  don't watch it, because its your loss for not being open to peoples opinions.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Some background, I have a college degree in CIS, I used to be a republican I even (regretfully) voted for Bush in 2000.  I met Dole once and voted for him as well. But soon after the Patriot act was signed I started to wonder about our good friend Bush and Ashcroft.  I wondered why they would push the Act that destroys so much of our privacy, and our rights in the name of 'security'.  That was the beginning of my research.<br /><br />I started to realize things were not as they seemed.  As I watched Bush, I started to see his faults, his unbelievable ignorance and certainty which can be seen by any footage of him, but more specifically in the recent debates with Kerry (9/30/04).<br /><br />I began to see his lack of diplomacy and realized after talking with my Indian friends at work how much the world really hates us, because of our policies and our [lack of] diplomacy.<br /><br />The invasion of Iraq was mind-boggling to me, I wondered why  would we involve ourselves in such a thing?  My ignorance at the time didn't tell me about the the massive oil reserves in Iraq.<br /><br />Which is clearly the plan.<br /><br />Since 2001 I notice Bush constantly talking about terrorism and I realized that it sounds a lot like fear mongering after a while.  I admit I was duped too, I felt very afraid for a long time after 9/11.  Not saying we are safe from terrorism, because there could be more terrorist attacks.  Mainly because of our foreign policies and their affect (read Chomsky's Hegemony of Survival).<br /><br />Bush has pushed me so far to the left it's ridiculous.  Keep in mind I have a deep distrust of the democrats in power as well.  As Chomsky says, the two party system is deeply connected to huge corporations and their interests.<br /><br />As for the movie, yes, it is opinionated and political, but it is also rooted in fact.  I knew a lot about the movie before I saw it from reading/news etc.  So much of it was NOT a surprise to me.  The movie is excellent, and I have to seriously question anyone that says Moore is not a patriot of the highest degree.<br /><br />The day that the Moore's of the world are silenced is a very frightening day indeed.  Rush Limbaugh gets to speak every day, and so does Moore.  One should hear both sides, then watch the news (more than 1 source), then listen to foreign news, then make decisions.<br /><br />The movie is a must see.  I have learned to look at all points of view before making decisions.  Look at actions of the politicians not their words.<br /><br />The movie shows a human face to the war- what it's really like.  Not 1 life is worth a single barrel of oil.  And you can see that millions of lives are affected by this need for oil.  We won't talk about ridding ourselves of oil dependency.  Hmmm... I wonder why?<br /><br />The movie is enlightening (for those that don't do their research other than political ads on tv), but I strongly urge everyone to see this movie, read the patriot act, try to understand it.  Take a close look at Bush and understand how scary it is the way our government treats other people.  Look at Guantanomo bay prisoners and their treatment.  Are they innocent or not?  They are being held illegally, and without representation.  What if Ashcroft decides to do that to you or me?  If they don't follow the rules there, why would they follow them here.<br /><br />In the movie, there is a scene where the soldiers break down the door of a home, and come in to arrest some guy, and they hold everyone at gunpoint.  This is especially scary, because it shows a use of force that is blatant and random.  And it can very well be in your own doorstep some day.  I've seen it.<br /><br />Celebrate the Moore's of this country!

At the time, they even gave out little badges to the audience that said: It's Going to be a Black Christmas this Year.

Sorority girls on campus over Christmas are, unknowingly, being slaughtered one at a time by a menancing stranger who will not stop calling their house.<br /><br />Cast is fine re: suspects and gals in peril.

B000002WPI|5.0|This is pure awesome, Wu-Tang at their best.  Perfect album.  No tracks have any flaws, don't listen to this goon saying Method Man's song was a flaw, that was one of the best tracks.  Any reviewer that gives this less than 5 stars has no idea about rap.  If you aint this, your opinion is garbage, so dont bother review anything coz u aint heard $h!t til u heard this. As i sed before, no tracks have any flaws, therefore they all must be 10/10. <br />Of all these classic tracks, its hard to select a few to be the best.  But i have, and they are Can It All Be So Simple, Da Mystery Of Chessboxin', Method Man, Protect Ya Neck, and the best song here is C.R.E.A.M. <br />Definitely in the top 10 rap albums of all-time.  Undisputed.  It's hard to say what is better than this.  One rap album that is (the greatest hip-hop album to date) is The D.O.C.'s No One Can Do It Better, but besides that, very few top this.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I did not see Shawshank Redemption until way after its release.  I became interested when I saw reviews in Parade by some actors and actresses who chose Shawshank as the best film of the year.  I totally agree.  I have now seen it at least 10 times, and I intend to buy the special limited edition. <br /> <br />To the naysayers, well to each his own, but seven academy award nominations speaks volumes. <br /> <br />
B000059LGC|5.0|Much like 1974's Murder on the Orient Express, this is a stunningly photographed, well directed, all-star cast movie. Frankly, I think Finney made a better Poirot, however this is certainly the best one Ustinov made, and much better than the several TV movie Poirots he finished with. On the other hand, this is a far better movie than the recent Suchet as Poirot version.<br /><br />This one is worthwile viewing for Lansbury's performance alone.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|This album was both pretty hyped and pretty disparaged from varying sources, as any comeback or reunion album is bound to be.  In the end, this is a good album, not remarkable and certainly not one of Iron Maiden's better albums.  But it's still highly listenable and all fans ought to check it out.<br /><br />One of my main problems with the album is the production.  The guitars are to clean and weak. They're about as thick as IM's guitars ever were, but they don't buzz or shriek much at all.  So the sound is clear enough, but it isn't heavy enough.  Other than the guitar tone the sound is fine, but the guitar tone is just about the most important part.  Even if the production weren't something of a problem this would be one of their weaker albums because the songwriting just isn't as consistent.  It also has some pacing problems.  Too many of the tracks are slow to mid-paced, quasi-balladic epics with extended clean sections, which prevents the album from generating the sort of energy it ought to.  Although the songwriting isn't quite up to par, Dickinson's vocals are still very good, and the leads are some of the best in metal.(Though they've cut down a bit on the dual harmonies from the earlier days, which is a loss. Though I suppose this allows for a bit more variety, which is always nice)<br /><br />Still, despite these criticisms, everything on here is at least decent, and most of it is quite good.  The Wicker Man is a great Maiden speed metal track.  The chorus is instantly memorable,  the verses are very energetic and catchy and it's got great leads.  All this is the recipe for a modern IM classic, which is precisely what this track is.  Ghost of the Navigator is excelent as well.  It takes a while to get going, but it's worth it, and it's actually quite evocative.  Probably the second best chorus on the album, too.  Out of the Silent Planet is great, probably the best track other than the opener.  I really like the intro and Bruce's gives perhaps his best vocal performance on the album.(particularly during the verses)  I'll admit that I didn't care for the chorus at first, but it's really grown on me. (though it's a bit too repetitious by the end)  I really like Dream of Mirrors, though it too takes a while to get into.  It's very slow building, once again, but it's got strong vocal melodies throughout, and it has quite a lot of impact when it finally gets going full speed.  But then you've got The Thin Line Between Love and Hate and The Nomad.  The former has some nice melody but fails to make a strong impression overall, and the latter, while having a great instrumental bridge, is pretty meh otherwise.  The Mercenary and The Fallen Angel are both pretty decent rockers but not terribly exciting or up to Iron Maiden's standards.  The title track and Blood Brothers are a fair bit better than those 2, but they, once again, aren't truly remarkable, and are fairly slow and deliberate.(Blood Brothers, however, deserves some mention for having rather odd, vaguely Irish feel to it)<br /><br />Well, that's about it.  This is a good metal album, but nothing more than that.  But, if you're like me, that's probably good enough.e on the album.(particularly during the verses)  I'll admit that I didn't care for the chorus at first, but it's really grown on me.

B000002LFZ|5.0|Fleetwood Mac released their first major greatest hits record with this collection.  The CD covers the years 1975 - 1988, when the group consisted of Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood.  Although the group formed in 1967 as a blues rock band, they didn't start having big hits in the United States until this period.  The CD includes 14 of their 16 U.S. Top 20 hits - only &#34;Think About Me&#34; (#20 in 1980) and &#34;Seven Wonders&#34; (#19 in 1987) are excluded.<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac recorded some of the most brilliant California pop-rock of the 1970s and 1980s, and this collection represents it well.  Their enduring popularity is witnessed by the over eight millions copies this record has sold.  In addition, having three talented lead singers and song writers helps make their music so varied.  I particularly enjoy Stevie's songs, such as &#34;Rhiannon&#34; (which went to #11, not #5 as stated in the Editorial Review) and &#34;Dreams.&#34;<br /><br />Two additional songs were recorded for inclusion on this set (Lindsey Buckingham had left the group by then).  &#34;As Long as You Follow&#34; features a solid vocal by Christine McVie and peaked on the Top 100 at #43 in 1989.  &#34;No Questions Asked&#34; is a somewhat cluttered-sounding song featuring Stevie Nicks that's not a particularly strong addition.<br /><br />Since the release of this CD, of course, Fleetwood Mac has reunited.  They also subsequently released the 2-disk &#34;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac,&#34; which covers 35 of their songs.  Whether you prefer to purchase this CD or the more extensive one obviously would seem to rest on how much depth your Fleetwood Mac collection already has and how deep you want it to go.  I'm sticking with this one as I have several of their studio CDs that help fill in some of the gaps, such as the sublime &#34;Landslide.&#34;
B000065PUE|5.0|If asked what my favorite cut from this album is, I am very nearly at a loss.  This disc is simply relentless, with one astonishingly polished, robust, inventive, glorious cut after another.  We like to talk about albums that have no filler, but this is one of the few that justifies that description.  If there is a critcism that could be made of this album, it is that it is too consistently brilliant to digest properly.  By the way, if forced to chose a favorite cut, I might go with \\"Gouge Away,\\" but I wouldn't go too far out of the way to defend my choice, and I might feel differently on a different day.<br /><br />Black Francis aka Frank Black aka Charles Thompson (his real name) is the heart and soul of the band, writing all the songs and taking most of the lead vocals, in the performance of which he often literally screams out the lyrics.  The man comes across as taut, angry, and more than a little manic.  Though his singing and songs make this the classic it is, the rest of the quartet carries their load as well.  Kim Deal adds some wonderful back up vocals throughout, and provides solid bass, never being simply a pretty face.  David Lovering lays down solid beats throughout the album, crucial in a project that depends so strongly on powerful rhythms.  And Joey Santiago plays great guitar on every song, providing an energy and texture that perfectly compliments Black's great songs.<br /><br />I have a couple of friend's who don't like this disc, and I am powerless to explain this.  This is one of those albums that, when fully digested, becomes part of one's emotional and musical furniture, a disc that I go back to again and again and again.  And it remains as vital and as fresh sounding today as it did when I first discovered it fifteen years ago.
0375422307|5.0|I am a 28-year-old Iranian woman living in the US.  This book is basically my life-story. It depicts the chaos and confusion of regime-change through a very wise child's eyes. Throw a revolution and a war into a country within 3 years of eachother and a child will grow up quick to ask questions and think deeper. Ms. Satrapi shows the way Iranians relate to eachother, the warmth of the family and the love for neighbors and friends in this short, illustrated book.  I recommend this book to anyone of any nationality who wants to know more about what happened in Iran and what many Iranians and Iranian immigrants went through during those times(1979-198X). It can also be of interest to those interested in culture and politics and how the changing class and power structures affect human relations (the window-washer turned head of Ministry of Health.) I have yet to read the second volume but I'm sure I'll enjoy it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The wait was worth it. The \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\" DVD set is gorgeous, complete with the three original films (ok, special editions, if you want to get specific), and a superb disc of bonus material, including all the theatrical trailers, TV ads, and a 2 1/2 hour documentary with never before seen footage. <br /> <br />What really stands out upon viewing is the picture quality of the films; \\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\" has been cleaned up so well it doesn't look like a 27 year old film anymore. Same with \\"Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\\". These could pass for films made in the 90's. <br /> <br />Which brings me back to the new CGI-enhanced scenes. I may be in the minority, but I have no problem with George Lucas' tinkering. In the 1997 special editions, the new footage clashed with the worn look of the original footage. It almost seemed as if you were watching two films. <br /> <br />Not anymore. Because the films have been cleaned up so well, the newer scenes blend in much more seamlessly than on the VHS versions. In addition, \\"Episode IV\\"'s Han Solo-Jabba The Hutt scene is improved, thanks to a new, better looking CGI Jabba, modeled after the one used in \\"Episode I- The Phantom Menace\\". I also loved the inclusion of Ian McDiarmid's Emperor Palpatine in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". I really feel the films are stronger because of these changes. As for the big change in \\"Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi\\", I don't have an issue with Hayden Christensen replacing Sebastian Shaw as Anakin's spirit. So much of \\"Jedi\\"'s last 5 minutes were altered in the 1997 special edition, this change hardly matters. <br /> <br />Realistically, don't expect this to be the one and only DVD release of these movies. Once \\"Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith\\" is released next summer and the series is concluded, a box set of all six films would be the next logical step. Perhaps then, if the fans are still asking for it, we'll get the special editions and the original versions in a complete package. Fornow, enjoy this. The force is strong with this one!
B00005JNEI|1.0|This man Doesn't care about anything but his career and how much money he makes off the american people sure he has alot of hate against the president but that doesn't give him the right  be able to  show off american soidier's that are true heroes defending are country something michael moore will never know all he know's is how to make his wallet fat he claims he wants to make a difference well do not do it by exploiting american service members and the american people in your propaganda film against the  president. Are troops need support not people trying to make a name for themselves every good american should boycott making mr moore anymore rich than he already is if he wants to make a difference maybe he should run for president instead of hiding behind his one dimensional films of propaganda we are americans and I think its time michael moore  woke up and started to act like one also he refers the service members as children. Well mr moore news flash everyone one of the service members are their by their own free will because there hasn't been a draft in a long time so don't treat them like they are children because they aren't their heroes defending are constitution against foreign and domestic threats and are way of life. So please do all the american people a favor and stop act because most people know what your all about I say to everyone who is thinking about buying this DVD buy something else because you will enjoy it alot more. I only rate this one star because amazon requires me to give aleast one star it isn't worthy of any stars.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Finally, with \\"Fahrenheit 9/11,\\" a bright and unavoidable light has been shined on things done in darkness. Any true American should shed tears when this important film tells how many legal Florida voters in democratic counties were disenfranchised on election day 2000, and how the subsequent wailings of leaders concerned about the damage done to our great democracy by what went down in Florida, fell on deaf ears in D.C. Something stunk that night in the sunshine state, and stinks to this very day, but, I guess it was clear early on that the we were entering a time when dissenting or questioning voices would be drowned out or silenced.  <br /> <br />Fortunately, Michael Moore's voice could not be silenced and the Bush family power structure had no way to manipulate the results. That's right, Moore's pack-of-lies movie did make it into theatres and played to packed houses for weeks and weeks, and became water-cooler, lunchroom, chatroom, cellphone, email and dinner conversation all over our great land. Now the pack-of-lies is coming to DVD, and to the DVD audience, I say, welcome to the light.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Errol Morris interviews Robert S. McNamera, former US Secretary of Defense (1961-1968) under JFK and LBJ, and once CEO of the Ford Motor Company. McNamera later became president of the World Bank Group of Institutions from 1968-1981.  <br /> <br />For those seeking answers to why the US went to Vietnam, you may be disappointed. McNamera purposely avoids this question as much as possible, but does admit that he and his fellow administrators made some crucial mistakes in judging the conflict in the first place. As for the Cuban missile crisis, McNamera recounts that, despite the best intentions of the US and the Russians to avoid the conflict, we almost didn't prevail (this section is a great supplement for those who liked the film, \\"Thirteen Days\\").  <br /> <br />This film is not so much about McNamera's role in the Vietnam war for which he is most famous, but more about one man's view of war in general over the last century. McNamera gives a very honest and straight-forward response to the strengths and shortcomings of the JFK and LBJ administrations, and more importantly of himself. While this is not a documentary on the history of war, (WWII, the Cuban missile crisis, or the Vietnam war in particular), McNamera honestly reflects on the strengths and shortcomings of US foreign policies over the last century.  <br /> <br />I was pleased to see that McNamera wasn't completely defensive concerning his role in the White House. He readily admits when he was wrong, which is refreshing to hear from any statesman. Even at age 85, McNamera gives a surprisingly candid response despite the fact that he is arguably one of the biggest scapegoats in history. He is not overly crotchety or defensive as one might expect. In fact, he has had enough distance and clarity to form some very honest opinions of himself and US foreign policy in general.  <br /> <br />By the end of the film, McNamera brings up the question, \\"how much evil must we do in order to do good.\\" He says this in response to the grudgingly admitted fire bombing tactics of WWII he personally developed to use against the Japanese. He argues that in WWII, the only way to end the war was to kill your enemy before he kills you. This is a gruesome statement, and one that he obviously makes with a bitter tongue. I don't believe he enjoyed performing any of his wartime tasks, but he believes they were the only measures available to him. <br /> <br />This is a compelling topic because at the highest levels of state, there may be times, when going to war may be unavoidable (ex. WWII), and that you unfortunately have to kill in order to preserve yourself. The problem, however, is always finding the right wars to engage in and the ones to avoid. And if you find yourself in a \\"just\\" war, is there any humane way to conduct it? Is there a civil way to conduct war? My assessments of McNamera's response to this subject is, no; war is hell. There is no such thing as a clean war. And, he states, war will not be eradicated in the future due to humankind's tendency for conflict.  <br /> <br />McNamera says that the conventional wisdom is to learn from the mistakes of history, however, there is no learning curve in a nuclear war as he states. You cannot make mistakes. One mistake could mean the end. One nuclear missile launched is equivalent to all missiles being launched, and thus the end of civilization as we know it.  <br /> <br />McNamera gives a list of eleven lessons of war in order to avoid war in the future. They are not mind-blowing or extra-insightful, but they do remind us of what McNamera is trying to tell us in this film: war is ugly, irrational, and usually avoidable only under the most luckiest of circumstances. <br /> <br />Overall, the film is worth seeing if only for the insight into the workings of the White House at the time. By the end of the film I found it hard-pressed to say if the US would have done better without him. You may have a hard time judging McNamera as well. He speaks like a war monger who hates his job and never wanted it; like a man who was faced with the ultimate decision, and completed the tasks presented to him as best he could, even if those tasks were some of the most grueling in history.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|You'll love this movie.  It is the story of the Quarterback that led Dallas to win back to back Super Bowls.  It is also the story of a Quarterback who had his career cut short by concussions.  It's not quite to the dramatic level of Brian's Song, but it will do.

0316096199|5.0|Alice Sebold's novel lets the ugly light of rape shine into our hearts. Ms. Sebold's endurance of such a brutal crime is a phenominal success! The power of her story, along with the tasteful delivery, make this novel a must read. The reader is truly led through Alice's mind from rape to recovery. The book can be graphic at points, but the pure sickness of the crime is not watered down to please any audience. Today, the cruel nature of rape is never fully portrayed: \\"It is not just forcible intercourse; rape means to inhabit and destroy everything.\\" Before reading the novel, I did not comprehend the entirety of emotional baggage rape leaves its victim.  Ms. Sebold should be admired and respected for sharing such a tragic event with the world. She overcome her circumstances and became victor from victim. If you have not been personally affected by rape, the book will lose none of its emotional touch. I personally recommend any mature teen or adult to read this moving novel.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore is obviously just as angry as any liberally minded American, and I am no exception. The helplessness that many feel under the current administration grows daily, and our faith in our leaders drops a little more each term. <br /> <br />The problem with Fahrenheit 9/11 is not necessarily the subject matter, but the way in which it is presented. There have been plenty of cool-headed news articles, TV shows, and radio broadcasts that lay out in great detail the many flaws and contradictions of George W. Bush, but none as venomous as Michael Moore's film. It is obvious that Moore is using every piece of data in his arsenal to dethrone Bush, but all too often he falls into the trap of sensationalism. Not to say that the actions of President Bush are not sensational themselves, but Moore 's version tends to boil the blood. Perhaps that is a good thing. Perhaps that's what voters need to get Bush out of office. The only issue I take with this sensationalistic approach is that it mimics the tactics of the far right. Radio personalities like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or Ann Coulter all use the most extreme elements of liberalism as their ammunition while they ignore many points of raw fact. They form opinions based on deep-seated hatred of the \\"other\\" party simply because they are not \\"them.\\" This is the attitude that I hoped liberal thinkers would not take part in. Unfortunately, this is the posture that Moore leans toward in his film. <br /> <br />The reason I take note of this, and believe it is worthy of discussion, is for the simple fact of credibility. I do this not to discredit Moore , nor do I do it to support Bush. I simply want a critical analysis, not just an analysis based on what I want to believe. In other words, I want to find out if everything Moore says is true, false, or smudged in-between. If I simply take what Moore tells me to be true, then I am no better than anyone who simply takes what anyone tells them to be true. <br /> <br />MichaelMoore uncovers little in his film that hasn't been addressed: the Bush connection with the Saudis, the Patriot Act issues, the 9/11 report, the alleged Iraq/al Qaeda connection, etc. These stories have been unfolding for the past few years and it was refreshing to see them all come together in a logical fashion. There are only two points that I wish Moore had been more careful in deliberating: <br /> <br />1. The Saudi flight on 9/13  <br /> <br />2. The absent mention of Saddam as a murderous dictator  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />1. The Saudi flight on 9/13 <br /> <br />I was discussing this with someone I know who's father is a big-wig at LAX. This person reminded me that the FAA lifted their ban on flights on 9/13, the same day Moore says NO ONE was allowed to fly. In fact, the FAA did lift their ban on many flights on 9/13. While most of the flights were still grounded, and many airports were kept closed by the FAA due to poor security, there were some flights that were allowed to fly (mostly flights that were already on route when the ban took effect). What Moore meant to say was that no NEW private or commercial flights were allowed at that immediate time. <br /> <br />Also, the independent 9/11 commission confirmed that the FBI did adequately interview 30 of the Saudis (it does not say if any of these 30 were from the bin-Laden family or not. We do know that some of the bin-Laden family was on board one or more of the flights in question which flew between 9/11-9/15). However, as Moore points out, it does seem highly suspect that the bin-Laden family was seemingly ushered out at the earliest convenience, and that they were not as thoroughly interviewed as they should have been in such dangerous time. <br /> <br />The point I'm making here is, while Moore 's statements were true, the whole picture was not painted for the public. He chose not to include the fact that SOME flights were being allowed by the FAA as a general lift of their ban. By avoiding this, Moore leaves us with a partial untruth, and these partial untruths are great ammunition for Bush supporters which ultimately only weaken Moore 's argument. By not revealing the fact that some flights were allowed to fly (whether or not it pertains directly or not the Saudi issue), Moore comes off as a manipulator of facts to his enemies. This in turn only discredits any true information he may have. By leaving out important elements, Moore 's enemies can say, \\"Ah-ha! He twisted the story to suit his agenda, therefore we can't trust anything he says!\\"  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />2. The absent mention of Saddam as a murderous dictator <br /> <br />Moore paints a picture of how rosy life was before the US bombs hit Baghdad . He shows people in cafes, women walking the streets with smiles, and even kids flying kites. This can be viewed either as a portrait of how innocent Saddam's Iraq was, or how innocent people were killed (and still are) during the US attack. Of course, Moore is presenting the fact that many civilian casualties were killed, but the rosy picture portrayed could easily be read as, \\"Saddam's Iraq was a swell place to live before the Americans arrived.\\" By not mentioning once that Saddam, at the very least, was a dictator that gassed many of his citizens and tortured many others, is irresponsible. This leaves the impression that Saddam's Iraq was just minding its own business, living in sweet harmony, when the US bombed away. <br /> <br />Now, the case for or against invading Iraq is a different matter of which I am not commenting on here. I'm only pointing out that omitting some details of why Saddam was targeted by the Bush administration (right or wrong) were purposely left out to stir emotions instead of objective fact. Again, Moore is not necessarily lying, but he's leaving out important parts of the story. He's leading the public in a similar manner that a Limbaugh or Hannity might. <br /> <br />Other than these two discrepancies, I felt that the film was very engaging and entertaining. Just the fact that the film was subject to banning and attempted banning in many cities attests to the power of cinema, and the power it has to sway the populace. This is why I commented on Moore 's approach. It is not meant to discredit him, as I mentioned before, but to hopefully bring to attention that even Michael Moore can make all the facts fit perfectly despite the fact that some facts are still clouded in mystery and subjection. <br /> <br />Everything he portrayed in his film has been documented and covered by various books and articles over the past few years. So, while there is not much new evidence displayed here against Bush, it is nice to see all of the indictments come together under one roof, even if it is done with a sensationalistic flair of entertainment. But then again, if all this information was presented in a calm, cool fashion by a show like FRONTLINE, then millions of Americans might not ever see it, which begs the question, perhaps sensationalism is necessary for mass media to get its message across. But do the ends justify the means?

B0001NBMEE|4.0|This film is a pure joy to behold!  The sets, costumes and even the cast have been made to resemble Hal Foster's comic strip as much as was humanly possible! Being an enthusiastic Prince Valiant reader I was stunned one Thanksgiving when I was around 10 or so as the special Hallmark Hall of Fame Movie turned out to be Prince Valiant.  I watched in utter amazement as the vibrantly colorful,action-filled film presented itself as a visually stunning and faithful rendition of Foster's vision. I had had no idea such a movie existed and have treasured it always. This year I am happy to say my VHS Taped copy of the film has been replaced by a fine Quality DVD purchased from amazon! I Highly recommend this film to all those who love a good, light-hearted adventure Tale!

B000059MEK|5.0|Over the past twenty years I've watched as dance music slowly <br />attained perfection.From funk,disco,fusion,electronica,techno,house to modern <br />DJ samples;none of it has truely clicked until Daft Punk,two young French sampler wizards,mixed everyone of those styles together to create a delightful hybrid of old and new.And they're not afraid to make 80's style (\\"Short Circuit\\") or 70's <br />style (\\"Voyager\\") dance music that fits into their hard core DJ <br />style!Yet it is on songs like the brilliant \\"One More Time\\", <br />\\"Aerodynamic\\" and \\"Harder,Better,Faster,Stronger\\" that they <br />succeed in synthesizing their many influences into a cohesive <br />whole.Sadly because they rely on samplers to create their music <br />Daft Punk are often denied the recognition they deserve. <br />         Also even a couple of the techno-ish cuts here fall a little flat-like a rave-style mix that is dated as soon as it's <br />recorded but the best material here will have to one day take it's place with what the Grandmaster Flash's,the Arther Baker's <br />and the Yesterday's New Quintet's of the world have already <br />accomplished.So Daft Punk:DO NOT GIVE UP YOUR FUNK!
B0001Z36PK|5.0|Neil Hannon has always been one of the most underrated British composers, which I find rather strange. After all he IS \\"The Divine Comedy\\" and the sole responsible for gems such as \\"Tonight we fly\\" or \\"Gin soaked Boy\\". In his new offering, he presents us with a batch of songs entirely different in mood than his previous CD - the equally remarkable \\"Regeneration\\". His beautifully crafted songs, accompanied by lush orchestration and his soothing voice are the norm here and we could definitely say he's back to top form. Mixing Oscar Wilde and simple stories of lost loves and missing friends, these lyrics are also among his best. Take \\"Our mutual friend\\" and the single \\"Come Home Billy Bird\\" - both are fine examples of  perfect pop songs. It is difficult not to fall in love with this CD and a great joy to see that Hannon hasn't yet forgotten how to thrill us. <br />
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors were probably more controversial than they were influential, but they were certainly one of the signature rock bands of the 1960s.  The group was formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by a pair of U.C.L.A. film students, keyboard player Ray Manzarek and vocalist Jim Morrison, along with guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore.  Because the group did not have a bass player their music was dominated by Manzarek's distinctive electric organ work and Morrison's evocative vocals of his evocative lyrics.  Signed a year later to Elektra Records with the goal of capturing on vinyl what the group did in live performance, their self-titled debut album featured the hit \\"Light My Fire\\" and because of their distinctive sound became one of the best albums of psychedelic music.  In fact, \\"The Doors\\" was such a great album that it made everything that came afterwards pale in comparison and gave credence to the idea the group was on a destructive arc fueled by Morrison's personal problems and then went nova with \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and \\"L.A. Women\\" right before his death.<br /><br />The music of the Doors was a peculiar blend of rock, blues, classical, jazz, and powerful lyrics.  Nobody around played guitar like Krieger, while Manzarek's classical influences showed up in his organ riffs, Densmore brought some Latin influences, and Morrison's lyrics contained moments of searing emotional poetry.  From the opening notes of \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\\" it is clear this group is different.  For somebody who was consuming mass quantities of drugs and alcohol, Morrison's lyrics were the sort that students should be discussing in literature class: \\"I found an island in your arms/A country in your eyes,\\" a love that becomes transmuted into \\"arms that chain\\" and \\"Eyes that lie.\\"  Then the song explodes into sound as the band announces its presence with authority.  This is such a key song in the history of the Doors that there is reason it leads off most anthologies and collections of their best songs.<br /><br />\\"Light My Fire,\\" and I can remember finally getting to listen to the long version having only heard the single version with the impressive, intricate organ solo that still stands alone as the epitome of what can be done with that instrument in a rock song.  Then Jose Feliciano proved how good it was in his totally stripped down acoustic version.  \\"Take It As It Comes\\" is also pretty good, even if not quite in that same class.  Still, it is the moodiness of \\"The Crystal Ship\\" and the \\"eleven-minute Oedipal drama\\" of \\"The End\\" that defined the Doors as one of the strangest and most ambitious rock groups around.  It is impossible to think of another Sixties rock group that was as disturbing as the Doors, an idea codified in popular culture by Francis Ford Coppola's use of \\"The End\\" at the climax of \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"  Not only literature classes but future psychologists and psychiatrists could have a field day analyzing Morrison's lyrics as well.collections of their best songs. <br /> <br />\\"Light My Fire,\\" and I can remember finally getting to listen to the long version having only heard the single version with the impressive, intricate organ solo that still stands alone as the epitome of what can be done with that instrument in a rock song.

I love this movie, and I'm sure that you will, too.
B000005IU2|5.0|This second, astonishing album by Detroit's The Stooges is one of the great, unadulterated, balls-out moments in rock music.  This is the first--and last-- time that rock, punk, metal and psychedelia would all organically coexist on one record, and the album remains a touchstone for punk, metal and radio-rock bands.  Three years later, the Stooges would produce \\"Raw Power,\\" a record which, like its title, is a little too straightforward and obvious.  However, in \\"Fun House,\\" their supreme moment, the Stooges wander through the drugged and adrenal detritus of the '60s with both distortion AND wah-wah pedals way up, and the result is simply intoxicating.     What appears to be on first listen a simple set of three-chords-and-a-scream protopunk turns into something much more interesting.  Don Galucci's production makes \\"Fun House\\", unlike their first, eponymous effort, really opens up and breathe.  Galucci creates a dark hint of space behind the lumbering swagger of \\"Down on the Street,\\" and on the buzz-saw \\"T.V. Eye,\\" the scream-and-howl sequence at the song's climax echoes eerily as the rhythm section shakes the listener buy the throat.  Guitarist Ron Ashton uses wah-wah, fuzz, distortion, echoes, layered lines and everything from scratching to full-on howling feedback to give the songs layers.  The rhythm section is as heavy as it is wiggly.    Riding this monster wave are Iggy's vocals.  From quiet moaning of \\"Hurt\\" to the twisted screaming at the end of \\"T.V. Eye,\\" Pop is almost as mesmerising on record as, fights and broken glass antics and huge see-your-soul eyes, playing live.  The music avoids the macho and sexist cliches of what would become metal and punk by not identifying Pop's Id with any political or social agenda.  You get the feeling listening to this disc that Iggy is coming to you straight and effortlessly from the unconscious.      The songs are heavy and groovy, sometimes tightly structured (\\"Down on the Street\\"), here and there touching (\\"Hurt\\"),and sometimes housewreckers that just beg you to pick things up and destroy them (\\"L.A. Blues\\").  This is deeply sexy, groovy and massively, MONSTROUSLY loud stuff, like its cover a maelstrom of sound, since unsurpassed.  Like \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"Zen Arcade\\", this record works as both beer drinking and dope-smoking music, equal parts adrenalin and groove.  The Stooges, like Curt Cobain, felt hugely \\"stupid/and contagious\\", and mananged to infect all of subsequent musical history.  What else is there to say?  Get it and turn it up, way up.
B00005JNEI|1.0|It's amazing how easily people's minds and opinions are swayed by what the media portrays. The fact of the matter is, we removed an evil man from power. We removed a man who has killed thousands of people, many of them women and children. Many of them his own citizens. We removed a sick, twisted individual who paid the families of suicide bombers according to the effectivness of the bombers' attacks. How many lives were saved because of the actions of President Bush and our armed forces? Impossible to tell. Regardless of anything else that's been said, it was our moral obligation to intervene. This was no different than the genocidal slaughters in Germany, in Rwanda, and in Bosnia-Herzegovia. Someone has to stop the madmen of the world. If not us, who? Michael Moore certainly put a dollar in his pocket with this film, but at what cost?
6304083769|5.0|As far as the original goes... <br /> <br />If you liked Major Kusanagi's dark night of the stroll through the rain-swept back streets of Hong Kong, you're going to love Bataou's visit to the Far North. Japanese film makers are twenty years ahead of us in every category, and if it hadn't been for Iraq, this joyride would have won the gold palm at Cannes, hands down.  <br /> <br />Only two films invite comparison, not counting the first GITS, of which this is a seamless continuation. One is Hayao Miyazaki's brilliant Cullinan of a movie, Spirited Away, which together with this one, sets the bar so high not even Pixar will reach it before 2020. The other is Blade Runner, oddly enough, which was as darkly epochal as either GITS, and apparently evocative as well.  <br /> <br />The viewer wades waist deep through a soup of rich pop-Mahayana aphorisms, but I guess if my culture were over a thousand years old, I'd be shy about introducing a new idea into the conversation without playing it against received wisdom, too. It pays to pay attention, though. This is a film about Batou, and no film about Batou is complete without mentioning Motoko Kusanagi, who only has a bit role in this film (so to speak, pun intended). Relax. Batou and the viewer are in good hands.  <br /> <br />On a scale from one to seven, GITS2 is a nineteen.
0060922583|5.0|Michael Talbot leads you by the hand with an easy-to-understand introduction and synopsis of the new physics, which is a necessary background in support of the Holographic Theory. The Holographic Theory is then the reference point used to explain consciousness, reality, cosmology, religions and the paranormal (from the everyday synchronicities and deja vu we have all experienced to the higher psychic and spiritual experiences documented throughout time by various gifted individuals and masses.) Explanations and scientific research/data are detailed -- every question I found popping into my mind was soon answered in this thorough work. As a woman \\"plagued\\" by unexplained experiences in my personal life and as a Native American confident in the concept that \\"we are all related\\", I found this wonderful book extremely helpful and validating. This well-written book, the Holographic Theory itself, and the new science of quantum physics, together take my own experiences and spirituality from pure mysticism to pure science. <br />Kudos to Talbot for making this an extremely readable, well thought-out, and thorough book for such a difficult and expansive topic.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I guess my Matrix experience was a little different than what some of the other reviewers had. Since I thought Keanu Reeves was not a good actor, I had no interest in seeing \\"The Matrix\\" when it was originally released. In fact, it wasn't until 2002 before someone talked me into seeing \\"The Matrix.\\" I enjoyed the movie so much that I bought it on DVD and was excited that there would be sequels. However, a major difference between my opinion and so many others was that \\"The Matrix,\\" I thought, was a great movie- but, it did not change my life in any way- I just enjoyed it. <br /> <br />I was excited when \\"Reloaded\\" came out. But, I didn't see it on opening night- probably not for at least a week. I didn't mark any calendars for the day of its release. Therefore, I enjoyed \\"Reloaded\\" a lot- pretty much the same as \\"The Matrix.\\" I thought it was another great movie (even a little better than the original, if anything, due to that great freeway chase scene).  <br /> <br />Regarding \\"Revolutions:\\" once again, I went into the movie just expecting another great movie. Although the dialogue was pretty bad in certain scenes- and I am also a sucker for happy endings, which this movie doesn't completely provide- I was satisfied with the movie.  <br /> <br />Let's see- the first movie was 75% matrix, 25% Zion/sci-fi/space ships stuff, the second movie was about 50/50- and you could see it coming right after \\"Reloaded\\" ended- this movie was going to be 25% matrix and 75% Zion/sci-fi/space ships stuff. You could see it coming. If you go into this movie knowing that the story is obviously going to go in that direction- you will probably like it much more than you might think by reading some of the other reviews posted. However, if you are just wanting more matrix-style scenes, you will probably share in the disappointment expressed by so many others. Once again, you could see it coming that this was going to be more of a sci-fi movie than the others.  <br /> <br />It does have itsflaws- but if you are like me and was not mesmerized by \\"The Matrix\\" and didn't overload this movie with a ton of expectations that it probably could never meet- you might enjoy it as much as I did.
B0000035E7|5.0|all i have to say is that this is definitely my favorite nirvana album
B00005JNEI|1.0|Absolute tripe......If you are close to being brain dead and know nothing of actual world affairs, you can probably be swayed by this movie.  If you are an independent thinker, and are educated in world affairs and politics, you will see this for what it is..........an ultra-left wing money-maker for Michael Moore.  Pass on this one.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I cannot believe what George has done.  Never in my life have I ever been so angry at him.  He has raped a national treasure.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This album, no matter what anyone else says about it, is one of the better that I have ever heard. I was initially turned on to Interpol by my big sister and now they're one of my favorite bands. Paul Bank's dark and melancholic voice perfectly complements their awesome lyrics.  <br />This CD would be in my top ten favorites, definitely. Interpol certinaly gives me much to look foward to as they create new albums. I would reccomend this CD or their other (Antics) to anyone looking for a great CD. But not necissarily a happy one.
B00000IL26|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums, it is definently my favorite lee morgan album, and it is definently the best hard bop album.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down was a good movie. It was about Army Rangers were suposed to go on a 30 minute mission to get some Prisners in Somalia Africa but the mission goes wrong and it ends up they have to fight the whole citys militia and the mission takes over 13 hours. We only lost 19 guys but in the movie it looked like we lost 50 guys. If you watched Saving Privet Ryan and liked it you should watch this. The begining is boring because you dont even find out what they have to do until its 30 minutes into the movie.
B00009ATKS|5.0|Their fourth proper album continues to see this Glaswegian quartet kick up the brackish discord found on 2001's \\"Rock Action,\\" although \\"Happy Songs for Happy People\\" is a tad subtler. That doesn't mean this is an easy-listening experience. Songs like \\"Hunted by a Freak,\\" \\"Killing All the Flies\\" and \\"Boring Machines Disturb Sleep\\" blaze out of the speakers in thickets of noise. With its turgid, whip-crack rhythm, \\"Moses? I Amn't\\" has the solemn air of a harrowing religious hymn, albeit one appropriate for Ramses' reign of terror. The creepily atmospheric \\"Kids Will Be Skeletons\\" could be a lullaby - if you want to induce bone-rattling nightmares. The eight-minute \\"Ratts of the Capital\\" begins with sensitively plucked guitars that eventually morph into a wall of wicked My Bloody Valentine-style white noise. The next track, the gentle \\"Golden Porsche,\\" provides the perfect comedown, followed by the even gentler, almost minimalist \\"I Know You Are but What Am I?,\\" which makes use of just a few choice chords on the piano - rather than the guitar - as its central figure. \\"Stop Coming to My House\\" closes the record on what is literally a disturbing note. If this album is Mogwai's idea of happy, I'd hate to hear how they'd express misery.  <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I love Green Day since some time ago, and I think that they are an excellent band, but let's go to the main point, AMERICAN IDIOT, you gotta listen this whole cd, is an excellent material from this NoCal band, and yes, truly a masterprice, the sound, Billie Joe's vocals, the instruments, how they know to mix a song, everything is pretty awesome from this cd!!!It makes you think the situation in America (I am from Mexico) but quit america, other countries feel the same way, I can include mine, it makes you think what are you doing in this world and why everything is going worse,but if this goverment can't change things, they only make them worst, but returning to Green Day, they are my favourite band, and if they have excellent cds, There is no doubt that this one is the best from all of the above. We needed good music this days, and here you have it. <br />WELL DONE GREEN DAY! Way to go!
B00003CXCT|4.0|I just want to address the changes to the original versions of the films that have caused such controversy regarding this DVD release.  I must say that now taking Episode 1-3 into account, most of the enhancements made to the original trilogy (including some CGI updated scenery and battles, the Jango actor's voice replacing the original Boba Fett's, Ian McDiarmid's voice and likeness as the emperor in ESB, and Hayden Christenson's image replacing Sebastian Shaw in the final scene of ROTJ) were actually integrated seamlessly and worked quite well.  Although Episodes 1&2 (and probably 3) will never hold a candle to the original trilogy, the new additions to the original trilogy do a good job of linking the new and old films together.  They make the old trilogy seem less dated, and add more common visual themes between the new and old films.  They create a sense of continuity between the two trilogies which was sorely lacking beforehand.  It improves the entire Star Wars experience, at least in my opinion.   <br /> <br />Of course, if you are one of the purists who completely disown Episodes 1-3 (which of course is your right to do so), then you will feel differently.  If that's the case, then you may want to avoid this DVD release like the plague.  But for those of us who might enjoy an updated presentation and some linkage to the new Star Wars films, you can't go wrong with these DVDs.  That being said, not all the additions work well.  The most annoying and pointless additions made in the Special Edition from a few years (Greedo shooting first, and the godawful new band performance in Jabba's palace) are unfortunately still present.  But thankfully, these are the only two instances where the enhancements leave a lasting bad impression.  These two miscalculations by themselves cannot really bring down the entire experience though.  I deducted half a star for these things, and another half star for the fact that Lucas has jerked us around with so many re-releases.  Honestly, I am not at all thrilled by Lucas' greed and disrespect for the fanbase.  But in all fairness, I cannot deny the quality of the product itself.  Its worth a look at the very least, and if you don't mind shelling out more cash to Lucas, its a good buy.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Why the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy wasn't released on DVD 5 years ago is beyond me, but now that I finally have them, I can rest easy...sort of. I got what I expected out of this DVD boxset: the special edition versions of \\"A New Hope\\", \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi\\"..,because we all know that the special edition versions are how George Lucas supposedly intended for them to be all along. I'll get to that in a minute though. I must say, they really did clean up the video and audio on these movies. If you go back and watch the original VHS releases, the video/audio quality is as different as night and day. So that was nice! The 4th disc which contains a bunch of special features including a behind-the-scenes look at \\"Episode III\\" are quite interesting, but I'm sure there could've been more stuff to put on there that Lucas is saving for another future re-release. Overall, this boxset is good and it's nice to finally have the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy on DVD...<br /><br />However, I was looking forward to throwing away my old VHS copies of the original theatrical versions, but it looks like I'm gonna end up keeping them around after all. With the exception of Greedo shooting first (God that was awful) I don't have much of a problem with the special edition version of \\"A New Hope\\" but the extras weren't needed. Now with \\"Empire Strikes Back\\", I think the special edition was actually better than the original...all the extras actually managed to enhance the film. But with \\"Return of the Jedi\\" the changes were just enough to upset my stomach. The corny and out of place CG images and retarded music was just not needed. I'm sorry, but you don't take some of the most classic films of the past 20 or so years and jazz them up with a bunch of terrible computer generated images and lame music. It's ruining art! It'd be the same if The Beatles went back and re-released all their albums with a bunch of keyboards and synthesisers and said \\"thats how we wanted it to sound.\\" I'm pretty sure everyone and their grandmother has written George Lucas begging him to put the ORIGINAL versions on DVD, but he keeps saying he won't do that because the special editions are how he intended them to be. Well, he could've made ALL of his fans happy by packaging the movies the way they did with the \\"Alien\\" movies or with \\"E.T.\\"...having BOTH the original AND special edition versions in one box-set. But we all know Lucas will crack one day and want more money, so he'll put out the originals on DVD, but he won't package them WITH the special editions...no no no. He'll have 2 seperate box sets so that all the Star Wars collectors will buy both. And that is why I take off one huge, very important star off of this rating. And that's my 2 cents.ure everyone and their grandmother has written George Lucas begging him to put the ORIGINAL versions on DVD, but he keeps saying he won't do that because the special editions are how he intended them to be.

0517122707|4.0|I can't decide whether this is a comedy or a tragedy. The array of characters and human foibles is simply amazing. It is hilarious and appalling, vulgar and sublime - it's simultaneously one of the few books that actually makes me laugh out loud, while there are also parts that are so exasperating I have to stop reading and come back to the book later on.  <br /> <br />There is no other book out there that is quite like this one, and so I advise: it should be experienced at least once. At least start it, even if you can't finish it - because the spectacular dissolution of Ignatius and his bizarre plots for achieving greatness really do start to wear you down, eventually - which in my opinion is also part of the book's brilliance.
B0000033P2|5.0|'Trilogy' was originally released in 1972 and even though it's been put out several times before, this lp was the 'in' thing among progressive fans before many of you were a gleam in a biker's eye. A total of nine tracks, including their biggest hit in the U.S. &#34;From The Beginning&#34; as well as &#34;Hoedown&#34; and a gem of the title cut &#34;Trilogy&#34; are the FM radio staples here.Other great tunes include &#34;The Sheriff&#34; and &#34;Abaddon's Bolero&#34;. There's plenty of Greg Lake's intricate bass and acoustic guitar playing here. A timeless piece of music history.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I haven't really gotten into Linkin Park before a couple weeks ago, but I was in the mood for a new CD so I burned \\"Meteora\\". It's actually better than I thought it would be, once you get past the fact that Chester (or whatever his name is) is screaming more than half the time. They do screaming AND rap, which is kind of weird but they make it work. I would say that Linkin Park is one of the few GOOD nu-metal bands. But whoever said this was pop must not listen very carefully, because even though it's played on pop/rap radio stations could you imagine Britney Spears singing this? Could you imagine GOOD CHARLOTTE (I'm not saying they're \\"hardcore\\"... Good Charlotte actually IS pop, with guitars.) singing this? No... well, maybe you could, but it would be pretty ugly. And it's not really metal either. If somebody like Iron Maiden did an album like this, I think the world would be coming to an end. So, I'm not really sure what you could call Meteora, but it's actually good. My favorite tracks are \\"Don't Stay\\", \\"Hit The Floor\\", \\"Faint\\", and \\"Breaking the Habit\\".
0440180295|4.0|Slaughterhouse Five, by Kurt Vonnegut, does not fall under the category of books I would usually read, but it is different from other books in this genre.  It is ironic, captivating, and interesting.  Most of all, it is passionate about it's anti-war message and can make even the most pro-war human being sympathize and indulge in deeper thoughts about the individuals and their lives that are affected by war.  I definitely recommend this book because of it's light-hearted style used to deliver a serious message in a novel that everyone can find appealing.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This movie, like a lot of movies over the summer, had a really bad storyline. But it was funny and interesting anyway. Ron Burgundy is one of those cheesy, annoying anchormen who works with a bunch of idiots (Brick, that cowboy dude, the guy who had the leopard perfume). Brick is probably the funniest part of the movie, and in the credits he says really stupid things. He says something like \\"I ate insulation one time.. this guy said it was cotton candy..\\" he's just really funny. It's also funny when they all sing that song ... I don't know what it's called. Anyway you'll like this movie if you plan on seeing a really dumb-but-funny movie!
0393035158|1.0|Harris' focus is off!  The real problem is a small percentage of radicals in each religion that want to interpret their religion according to their own small minds.  To blame religion as the problem for ills of society is as small-minded as those radicals who interpret religion in extreme, self-serving ways.  Religion (i.e. Christianity) is all about the service of others and selflessness.
B000089RVX|3.0|I expected a lot from this record, so I was dissapointed after I listened to it. All the songs are similar. I'm not saying Evanescence suck, because they really don't. They are just pretty overrated. Amy Lee has a nice voice, but it's nothing special. I could claim that mine is just as nice as hers. There are millions of singers like her. There are few good tracks on \\"Fallen\\". I personally like \\"Going Under\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" very much, even though radio stations world wide have raped them, but the music doesn't touch my heart at all. I'm afraid that Fallen is going to be the only succesful album from Evanescene. They have a lot of potential. But don't call Evanescence metal, because they aren't;). There are two European female fronted metal bands I find very professional and wonderful: Nightwish from Finland and After Forever from Holland. Try them; you won't be dissapointed! Nightwish's Tarja's voice is just so beautiful. She's a professional opera singer, btw.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I totally love Green Day and I knew that I would like the new CD but 'like' is too weak of a word. I love everything about it! <br />Every song has some amazing hook or lyric that you will find yourself constantly humming or thinking about. Billie Joe's voice sounds fantastic, too! I love the cover art as well. I would give anything to see one of the handful of shows where they are going to perform the whole record. Hopefuly they will record it and release a DVD in the future! I hope people won't be put off by the \\"rock opera\\" tag because it's so much better than that. Even though some of the songs have long track listings, there's so many changes in tempo and structure that it's like three or four songs in one. Honestly, it's so hard to describe how genius this record is, so just buy it! I promise you will be glad you did!
B000002J09|5.0|The Stairway to heaven is the best song written ever. It's just so great. Building from start till the end. We have to remember that that they were really young when they wrote that song. The history behind the whole band and especially with that song is so interesting. <br /> <br />It really makes you wonder!
B00005AWMF|5.0|I love this album and was excited when it came out in 1994. I ended up getting it in January 1995.  I just bought the CD version yesterday.  Fabulous songs like Smooth Operator, Sweetest Taboo, Paradise, No Ordinary Love, the glorious Pearls, Your Love Is King, Is It A Crime,Jezabel and many others. Their jazzy R&B worked for radio and it led them to platinum plus albums!  Although she took a 8 year hiatus before Lovers Rock came out, she regained her footing and still had sold out concert crowds for her tour!  This album demonstrates her best as well as her band!
B0000646UN|5.0|Yes! I'm a finn and I cannot give you a totally perfect description about this movie. It just contains so much things that other people just are not able to understand. <br /> <br />For me this movie is so important as a finn. I'm not sure, but I think these guys where the only one in the whole world that had stopped the sovied army invation on their border. <br /> <br />The fact that both of my grandfathers had been fighting exactly same places in Taipale like this movie makes it special to me. They never talked about war to me, but my father told me that the coloned that appeared in the movie, Matti Laurila, actually visited my grandfather before the war. <br /> <br />I'm not going to judge the DVD because I have not seen it, but have seen the TV version and It's about 4 hours long. So I could imagine how much they have had to edit out. <br /> <br />I would to recommend this movie to all those who still believe in high spirit that no land cannot be taken over, if they are all just standing as a one solid nation. It does not matter small they are.
B00003CXCT|5.0|There is far too much carping about the fact that these films aren't the 'original'.  These films are the babies of George Lucas, and I feel certain he wanted to make sure that they didn't grow dated, so he updates a few explosions, adds two or three minutes of new footage...that's his prerogitive.<br /><br />The fact remains that these three films are landmarks in cinematic history, and reminders of the joys of corny innocence.  The \\"Force\\" is hokey, the Stormtroopers can't hit the side of a barn, Chewbacca is a guy in an ape suit...and the whole thing is a hoot!  Pure, unadulterated romantic fantasy, that's what these movies are about. So kick back in your favorite chair and revisit these tales from a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
0060926317|1.0|This book is based on fabrication and falsehood. Do not believe one word written by the author. This is the most culturally insensitive book I have read. It does a grave injustice to the native people of Australia. This is a self-serving book used to propagate a New Age philosophical agenda unconcerned with the culture it purports to exemplify.
0694003611|5.0|I have been reading this book to my 18 mo old since he was tiny.  Not only is it one of his top choices but one of mine.  I have always pointed to the objects as they are mentioned but in the past 6 mo or so he has done most of the pointing.  We also have to go through all the clocks, the elephant, the bunny ect...  This is the best part of our nightly ritual.   <br /> <br />Just to mention, the daytime fav. is \\"Hand, Hand, Fingers, Thumb\\".  As you read it this one sounds like a steady drumbeat and he still goes just wild for it.  When he gets truly upset (shot time at the doctors for example) I just start quoting that book and he usually calms right down.  It is also repeated in the car almost everyday.  If it keeps him happy then I'm happy.
0385512104|5.0|If you enjoy getting into someone else's unusual mind, this book is for you.  It's always interesting to find out how someone else truly thinks and feels, but this is done so masterfully by Mark Haddon that we feel we are treated to a scientific, emotional exploration of an autistic brain. The boy in question possesses remarkable gifts in mathematics and certain memory feats, but does not tune into people and the reasons they tick so well.  However, he has a strong connection with animals and when a neighbor's dog is mysteriously killed, the boy is upset and needs to find out why. This forms the basis of the plot and from there we get into his journey, both mental and physical, which leads to a highly emotional conclusion.  Scattered throughout the book there are amusing illustrations of how his mind works and reacts to things.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is widely regarded as the classic masterpiece for all comic warfare novels.  It cleanly addresses the pointlessness of trying to escape war, as well as topics such as bureacracy, hypocrisy, and captitalism.  It has a cynical, sarcastic style of writing that is sometimes hard to trudge through however.  Yet while using this style, Joseph Heller has perfect control of where he wants the story to go; what he wants you (the reader) to feel.  Through the eyes of the sometimes crazy Yossarian, we see that no matter what he does, he cannot escape flight duty during World War II.  Yossarian flies at maximum altitude to evade German anti-aircraft \\"flak\\", changes flight maps, destroys the cockpits radio, even fakes illness to get out of flying.  An antagonist of the story, Colonel Cathcartt, keeps raising the number of missions required to fly before the pilots can be honorably discharged.  This really ticks off the reader as well as many pilots, even driving one to have violent nightmares.  I would recommend this book to individuals thinking about joining the military because of its exposure to a different side of war.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is unlike any of their other albums before, and it rocks!  It's got a good amount of both their traditional punk rock stuff which is always awsome and some more slow songs which also rocks.  This album is very...shall I say...opinionated, but I'll let you decide whether or not that's a bad thing.  I for one don't care.  All I know that this is definitely one of their best albums ever and a must-have for any Green Day fan or anyone!
0066620996|4.0|Don't get me wrong - this is an excellent book and should be required reading for all senior executives because it is thought provoking and much of the framework no doubt represents best practice.  I am sure that by adopting several of the concepts management will increase the chances of success.  However the basic tenant of this plus the previous book - \\"Built to Last\\" I take fundamental issue with.  I don't believe that the fine distinction between companies such as P&G and GE - not great according to Collins and Walgreens and Gillette considered great is meaningful.  Surely P&G and GE are great companies - especially over the long term.  Collins tends to take a short term financial view - taking a maximum of 20 years performance.  There is only one company considered to be in the top 100 companies in 2004 that was there is 1917 - GE.  With regard to the basic concepts I found the most useful to be \\"First Who...Then What\\" and \\"The Hedgehog Concept\\". I don't agree with the \\"Level 5 Leadership\\" of shy and self effacing people.  In my experience the best leaders have charisma, charm, a sense of humour and are eternally optimistic - these characteristics are much more important than being humble, reserved and quiet.  \\"The Culture of Discipline\\" is of course important but \\"Execution\\" by Bossidy and Charan covers this subject in more depth and with more tangible recommendations. <br /> <br />Here's an alternative approach - maybe someone should study the behaviours that have lead to the worst performance of companies over the past 20 years; it could be called \\"Bad to Worst\\". I think there is far more to learn from mistakes and how to improve on poor performance - maybe the best way to be Great is too learn most from the worst!! <br />
B00005JMJG|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that it is seldom we see a movie based on who the screenwriter was but Charlie Kaufman plays in a league of his own.  Although I think all his movies are amazing and magical, this one is easily the best.  The work of all the actors is superlative.  Jim Carrey takes your breath away. <br /> <br />I could never be a movie critic because the movies that wow me are the ones that I experience viscerally.  I missed this film in the theater (I live in a small town and small films come and go so quickly) so have waited 6 months to see this.  How appropiate it came out on dvd the day after my boyfriend ended our relationship.  I rented the dvd and alternately cried and smiled my way through the entire film, certain at one point that I would opt for the \\"procedure\\" myself and equally certain at other times that I would not give up my memories of this wonderful time in my life for anything. <br /> <br />This film touched my heart and I cannot recommend it highly enough.   <br /> <br />
0451526384|4.0|The novel Persuasion by Jane Austen is very good. Although slow at places, it definatly redeems itself throughout the novel. The protagonist, Anne, is in love with a man, but is persuaded out of love because of his social status. The book is a classic romatice novel, but is not cheesy to say the least. I encourage everyone who enjoys a good novel to read this book, but especially females. This book is centered around the social status and appearance of the people in the early 1800's. The way Anne doesn't care, makes her differant than the rest of the characters, but also helps the reader consider thinking for themselves instead of being persuaded by other people's thoughts. By the end of the novel, the reader has the decision whether persuasion is good or bad. I really enjoyed the novel. The reader just needs to be able to make it through the first couple of chapters, then the book is really enjoyable.
0743455967|4.0|This is not great literature but then again maybe it is. I felt his pain and anguish after his near death experience, as I felt his frustration at the urge to write and his despair at no one listening. I felt his guilt and suffering through his alcohol addiction and his deep, abiding love for his long suffering wife. I think that is great literature, maybe not great prose, but satisfying, rewarding and adding value to my time - greatness.<br /><br />The book is full of tips for young players and even some detailed advice on what to disregard in the world of grammatical correctness (embellished of course with suitable cautions) and telling the real story.<br /><br />He is a good - no a great - writer and what I would have given to have him as a teacher. I haven't read many of his novels (yet) but grew up on his films. I think Carrie was the first, but it has a new significance when you understand the cognitive processes that brought the ideas in to this world from King's own. This book though is of more value to me than any of his fiction.<br /><br />King is a purveyor of the stark reality of writing for a living and boldly go those before and after him in that quest. This is a must read.
0792165020|5.0|Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith-- an earlier French film PURPLE MOON was made from the same novel-- this 1999 film starring Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law is beautifully filmed. Much of it was shot in Italy (including Venice). Damon (Tom Ripley) plays an attractive psychopath, poor in assets but rich in imagination, who will stop at nothing, including murder, to get what he wants. He manages to con his way into the lives of Jude Law (Dickie) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Marge) in this byzantine tale of greed, desire and obsession. There are many twists and turns to the plot that never drags.<br /><br />This movie is not to be missed.
B0002I831S|3.0|This version has great 5.1 sound, menus, and features.  The deal breaker for me is that the episodes are not in order (stardate).  They are arranged by original air date.  This puts the second pilot behind several other episodes and jumbles up the first half of the season.  I have had the series on vhs for a decade.  I guess I'll be happy with that.  One last thing, as of now (10/3/04) Amazon has the best price by $20 or $30 bucks of any where I have seen.
B0002Z0EYA|3.0|I'm always on the lookout for DVDs that I could use for my comparative literature classes. HELEN of TROY and TROY both have their high points and low points. A good point of HELEN is that it shows Hera, Athena and Aphrodite making Paris judge who among them is the fairest goddess; a bad point is that Achilles' weak heel is never given a deeper discussion (\\"Why is that his kryptonite?\\" non-mythophiles would wonder). A good point of TROY is that Achilles' mother Thetis is given a spotlight (albeit briefly), thus shedding a light that alludes to his weak heel; a bad point is that he, not the wily Oddyseus, was given credit for the building of the Trojan Horse. And wasn't he already dead when the Horse was dragged into Troy? And the war took more than a few weeks; it was ten years. The movie is just as destructive as Disney's HERCULES. Sure, no one has the copyright to these myths, but young viewers would get misled and, being of the movie generation, they have the tendency to prefer Hollywood to, say, Edith Hamilton. CLASH OF THE TITANS is, to my opinion, the best rendering of a Greek mythological hero, because the story is not alienated of the gods and no filmmaker has offered to surpass its success. HERCULES starring Lou Ferrigno has got to be the worst; it should never even have been put on betamax. <br /> <br />I would still like to see a film about the Trojan War that focuses on the gods themselves -- from the beauty contest on Mount Olympus to the Olympians disguising themselves as Greek and Trojan warriors to Athena's inspiring Oddyseus to come up with the Trojan Horse. Perhaps Xena's producers are reading this review.

B00005JMJG|5.0|\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is arguably one of the most complex and brilliant dramedies in the Romance genre. Not only is it one of the best films of 2004 but it's probably one of the best films within the last decade. It's absolutely amazing. Jim Carrey and Charlie Kaufman are at their very best in this brilliant piece of cinematic art. This is my second viewing today (My first was at the theaters about 6 months ago) and I don't think I could ever get tired of it. Kaufman, your Oscar is coming. Hopefully the Academy won't be dumb enough to ignore this one.     Jim Carrey, in one of his most subtle and best performances of his carrer, plays Joel, a quiet and mousey man who buries himself in writing a bunch of journal entries of his \\"not very interesting\\" life (Which explains why there's several blanks). But then he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), a free-spirited but rather impulsive woman who changes colors of her hair that depict her many different moods. They epitomize the \\"opposites attract\\" phrase because Joel's shy and Clementine's energetic and talky. They're immediately attracted to eachother which leads to a long-term relationship that ends rather badly. Joel's heartbroken beyond belief after an encounter with Clementine when she acts as if she's never seen him before in her life. Confused and ultimately sad, he then realizes that she has had her memory erased of him over at a clinic called Lacuna, which specialzes in erasing the memories of a certain person in the patients minds that upsets them. Joel desperately decides to participate. But is this really what he wants? Do you seriously not want to remember your past girlfriends/boyfriends?    Director Michael Gondry, creates rather surreal imagery and deja-vu that brings you inside the mind of Joel's memories, which he is gradually losing. The visuals are innovative on his memory loss. People begin disappear, surroundings begin to break apart, Joel's brought into a new memory in an instant (Some of his childhood, which are some of the most bittersweet and amusing parts of the film), etc. But the props of the film go to Charlie Kaufman. I am just obsessed with Kaufman and I think he is, along with David Mamet, the best screenwriter in Hollywood.  I never thought any of the brilliance and complexity of \\"Adaptation\\" would ever be topped,  but \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is his best work to date.  As for Carrey, his performance was wonderfully subtle compared to his previous work. He portrays Joel as a quiet and melancholy individual and that's a different turn for Carrey since he's known for playing maniacal or goofy characters from \\"The Cable Guy\\" and \\"Dumb & Dumber.\\" Not the least bit of overacting in this performance. So if you're the usual Carrey fan, I wouldn't recommend it. But as for film buffs, definitely recommended. It's moving, it's sad, it's funny and it's brilliant. \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" maybe one of the best comedies ever made in a long time (or ever, period).
B00003CXCT|5.0|You people need to get over it and except that this is the way Lucas wanted the films to be to begin with.

1400032717|4.0|A story told through the eyes of a 15 year old autistic boy, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is an easy read, though richer meaning can be contrived from many well described simple details.<br /><br />Light in emotions but deep in description - Haddon has obviously used his experience working with autistic children to great advantage. The result,  Christopher Boone. A very raw, well developed character - with realistic ideas about life, and simple views and perspective into humanity.  Other characters introduced and situations explored in the novel are quite complex in detail - however Haddon's writing style provides wonderful insight into these situations, as the reader is able to perceive these instances through Christophers simplistic reasoning.<br /><br />To be completely honest in my review, I'm no genius, and found a lot of the mathematical parts confusing. Haddon has done quite well simplifiying them in layman's terms, though often I found myself skimming over these parts. The content of these parts is in fact of little importance and by skimming over them I was only further emphasising the idea that Christopher Boone is a mathematical genius. And Haddon has done particularly well in conveying this through his novel with colourful descriptions and diagrams.<br /><br />A 2-4 hour read, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is very well presented. The cover has a hole-punched dog, which looks through to a page of reviews on the novel. This book would make a great gift for anyone from teen to elderly.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I just attended the Norah Jones concert last night in Berkeley, too.

B000002JNJ|5.0|Believe it or not, Pantara was a hair band and released metal magic, projects in the jungle, in the night, and power metal before CFH.  However, they conveniently slipped them under the carpet at the release date of CFH.  This album kicks major arse, nonetheless.  Songs that stood out were \\"Shattered\\", Cowboys from hell\\", \\"the sleep\\", and \\"psycho holiday\\".  All the songs were great, though.  (Reinventing the steel is heavier, harder, thrashier, and more kicka** if that's what you want.)
B0000DZEA1|4.0|Howard Shore is turning out to be one of the  best composers out there, and his LOTR trilogy is truly spectacular.  The Return of the King had some great music, and I was truly looking forward to hearing it without all the voices, sounds, and other interruptions from the film. There was one track in particular I really, really wanted to hear;  the music from when the Rohirrim ride down on the armies of Mordor, with Theoden at their head.  HOW IN THE HELL WAS THIS LEFT OUT!  This was the most stirring music in the film, and really helped make that one scene one of the best and most memorable of the movies.  Truly, I cannot fathom why it was left out.  I had hoped that the track \\"Ride of the Rohirrim\\" might be it, given that most of the tracks are all slightly mis-named.  Much to my dissapointment, I was wrong, and it simply isn't there.  Someone, PLEASE release a nice additional tracks CD for these movies, sort of like what came out for Star Wars, and for Gladiator.

0767805712|5.0|\\"Gattaca\\" (1997 - 112 minutes) is one of the best scientific fiction movies of the 90 years. Deep, overwhelming and controversial, it was written and directed by Andrew Niccol. Gattaca, the name of a specific DNA strain sequence of the human body, is also the denomination of a space trip megacorporation. The society described in the narrative adopts the genetic manipulation to improve the attributes of each human being. In fact, the people are classified as \\"valids\\" [or perfect conceived in laboratory] and \\"invalids\\" [conceived by the natural method]. Vincent Freeman [the actor Ethan Hawke] is one of \\"invalids\\" having to support his stigma of birth, beyond other imperfections. He has an illness that limits his life to 30 years - in contrast to his younger brother, Anton [Loren Dean], that was designed genetically and is a member of the elite. But Vincent did not accept his destiny. He aims for changing his life and fulfill his dreams, travelling to other planets. To qualify himself as a space pilot, the young one would have to be \\"perfect\\" or \\"valid\\". As in that society the identity of someone was not confirmed by documents but by their genes, Vincent perceives that he has to turn himself into another person to obtain what he wants. Through a DNA trader, he knows Jerome Eugene Morrow [the actor Jude Law], a superior being that was paralyzed  in an accident and was excluded from the society. Using samples of blood, hair, skin and urine of Jerome, Vincent assumes his identity, becoming a navigator. Vincent also falls in love for the pretty Irene [the actress Uma Thurman], his colleague in Gattaca, that does not know his true identity. One week before the space mission, a murder in Gattaca starts an inquiry led for Anton, that is a policeman. Vincent is in a great danger to be discovered. <br />The main message of the film is that there is no genes for the spirit. Extraordinary. <br />
B00029LNHS|5.0|This is a great album that everyone can listen to, whether you like pop, rap/hip hop, R&B, funk or rock. <br /> <br />1. Hands Up- 8/10 It's not the best song on the album, but its ok <br /> <br />2. Labor Day (It's A Holiday)- 7/10 Kind of strange song about Labor day, but it has a good beat. <br /> <br />3. Let's Get Retarded- 10/10 My favorite song. You've probably heard the radio edit 'Let's Get It Started'. Just so everyone knows, retarded is this case means 'Let's Get High', it's not making fun of retards. <br /> <br />4. Hey Mama- 10/10 Pop/Rap song. It's different than on the radio, and it might suprise you that it says \\"Hey Mama this that sh*t that makes you groove\\", not 'This that beat\\". Also, Fergie has a different part on the album than on the radio. <br /> <br />5. Shut Up- 10/10 Great song with good instrument parts about breaking up. <br /> <br />6. Smells Like Funk- 9/10 Good R&B/Funk song with good beat. <br /> <br />7. Latin Girls- 6/10 If you don't speak any spanish, you'll probably hate this song because a lot of this song is in spanish. Has a latin beat but its still not that good. <br />  <br />8. Sexy- 8/10 OK Song but not my favorite. <br /> <br />9. Fly Away - 9/10 Fergies pop song but is pretty good for pop. <br /> <br />10. The Boogie That Be- 10/10 Great song with awesome beats. <br /> <br />11. The apl Song- 8/10 Very pretty song, but very sad sounding  and the chourus is in the Language of the Phillipines. <br /> <br />12. Anxiety- 10/10 Rap/Rock song which is really good. Good guitar parts. <br /> <br />13. Where Is The Love?-10/10 Featuring Justin Timberlake and tackles racism very nicely. <br /> <br />13.5. Third Eye- 9/10 Hidden Track after where is the love which is pretty good. <br /> <br />14. Let's Get It Started- See Let's Get Retarded <br /> <br />As you can see, this album is fabalis. It's what I listen to during drive bys.
B000005HLV|5.0|well when i first got the cd, well, i was a little disapointed that it did not come with any lyrics....it did not have any fansy packaging, but then i put it in the cd player, turned it up to 11, and i could not believe my ears. those sweet guitar lines perfectly mixing with the drums and bass to creat brutal brainsucking sweetness, it took me on a dark journy to another world, and then came the vocals. this guy who sings on this album, i like his voice, it is unique and creepy. so i listened to the first song over and over again for the first week thinking there is no way all the other songs were that good, wow.....was i wrong or what? i defently recomend this to anyone into metal wether your intrest is black sabbath or exhumed, but still, it is not for the squemish.  <br />\m/ (&#62;_&#60;) \m/ <br />hail to black metal <br />hail to euronmyous and dead....who are actually dead members of this band. <br />let me also add that funeral fog is a nice pot smoking song.

This may remain one of the most interesting books that I have read this year, and will remain in my collection of favorite books.<br /><br />Keep up the excellent work !
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Call it showing off.  I call it men who can play doing what they do best.  After the therapeutic release of \\"Six Degrees...\\", this continues in their quest to release inner demons.  \\"Honor Thy Father\\" might be the angriest song I've ever heard, and it gets me out of a bad mood every time.  Thanks for having the courage to write \\"In the Name of God.\\"  Someone had to say it, and you did.  Jordan's influence is helping develop good technique and incredible performances.  James' vocals are getting better, too.  This album has been in my car for nearly a year now, and I just can't get tired of it.  For the non-musicians, these guys also pay tribute to their musical ancestors by doing things like putting 21:12 notes (\\"2112\\" is an album by Rush that I've heard them cover) in their music.  Thanks for taking progressive music to the next level.  And thanks for putting out good sheet music for those of us who just want to play along.
630476524X|2.0|Somehow, this Crow just doesn't have the impact I was looking for.<br /><br />The next movie in the Crow series (Salvation), created a sustained game of cat and mouse between the hero and the bad guys. It really created some tension. This movie, by contrast, seemed like a series of unrelated events. The episodes of revenge didn't build on each other - if they had been edited into any other order, it probably wouldn't have made much difference.<br /><br />The ending seemed weak. I like some mystery, I don't need to have eveything explained, but I want a movie to follow its own internal rules. This one just seemed to make up new mysterious forces whenever the scriptwriter got confused.<br /><br />The visual styling is noir grunge, and fairly effective. The majority of the movie has a nearly monochromatic color scheme in one hue or another. The last scene, in the afterlife, was dominated by blues. Cool and calm, it worked. The majority of the movie used tones of orange, though. I found the choice of color odd, and just never developed a strong response to it.<br /><br />I like The Crow as a series, I like the gritty city images, and I like thoughtful use of color to set a mood. I just didn't like this.<br /><br />//wiredweird
0451528018|4.0|Sherlock Holmes is approached by a concerned doctor from Devonshire, in this longest and most famous of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's mysteries.  A novel in its own right, this tale of the macabre murder on the moor (which houses a desolate prison) takes Holmes from London to the dreaded Grimpen Mire-treacherous with pockets of quicksand.  But nothing will deter the famous Victorian sleuth from helping an innocent man discover the truth about the family legend.  Is it really a hound from Hell or something more worldly which threatens to wipe out the Baskerville family?<br /><br />  Even Holmes expresses reserve about taking on the devil himself, for he admits that this foe is as vicious and clever as any he has encountered.  Forced to go undercover, Holmes delegates faithful Dr. Watson to guard the new baronet at Baskerville Hall, with serious instructions to send regular reports of all he uncovers to him in London.  Doyle's style includes lenghty dialogue, unrealistically long and detailed letters, with alternating slow and fast pacing; the interesting denouement, where all lose ends are explained, occurs curiously two months later.<br /><br />  THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES proves vintage Victoriana, where Holmes' mind proves as fertile and agile as the master criminal's elaborate schemes to defraud the true heir.  Holmes uses both his \\"irregulars\\" and Scotland Yard to help him achieve justice on the moor.  If this is your introduction to the sleuth who resides at 221-B Baker Street, be sure to enjoy an anthology of his fascinating and deadly short stories.

B0002NRRAG|5.0|As labels and critics search for someone to declare the \\"next Nora Jones\\", I'm surprised that few have turned to Madeleine Peyroux one of her precursors. The French expatriate Peryoux released her first album, Dreamland, on Atlantic Records in 1996. The cd was well promoted and ended up doing quite well for a jazz oriented release.<br /><br />Ms. Peyroux didn't seek instant fame and promptly dropped out to spend the six years on a spiritual quest and to spend time with friends and family. To her credit, career amibition was not at the top of Madeleine's list of priorities...she had better things to do.  Lucky for us, the venerable indie label, Rounder Records has enticed her back into the studio for another set of music and a cd that is getting the same kind of word of mouth praise that launched Nora Jones' career.<br /><br />Those less educated in jazz idioms may compare her to Billie Holliday...her timbre and pitch are just very similar. Those with a nuanced ear will here strains of Edith Piaf, Josephine Baker, Peggy Lee and a host of other torch singers, even Joni Mitchell, who was one of Madeleine's producers for Careless Love.<br /><br />One of the songs Peyroux interprets on the new CD was sung in 1940s Paris by another American-born artist, Josephine Baker. The sweet melody saluted bonds between America and France while expressing the bittersweet emotions of the expatriate.<br /><br />Her takes on Elliott Smith's Between the Bars and Hank William's Weary Blues are superb,but her reading of Dylan's \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" is so remarkable, you will find yourself replaying it over and over. She captures the ambivalence of the lyrics in a way Dylan never did. As much as I spun and respun the Dylan tune, I was in nirvana upon hearing Leonard Cohen's \\"Waltz Me To The End of Love\\", in which she fully renders the unblinking fatalism of Cohen's lyrics. Peyroux is to Cohen's music what Dionne Warwick was to Burt Bacharach's music... the definitive interpreter who sets the standard for all.<br /><br />Singer Madeleine Peyroux moved to France at age 15. She honed her vocal talents on the streets of Paris, busking with groups with names like the Riverboat Shufflers and the Lost Wandering Blues and Jazz Band.<br /><br />Madeleine's live shows have proven her to live up to the current hype. Her pronunciation so clear and the word nuances so well united with her use of facial expression, seeing her in person is really necessary for a full appreciation of her art. In performance she has the aura of a Parisian muse in the tradition of Jeanne Moreau or Isabelle Adjani. I hope very much that a live performance video will be spawned by the album so that her wider audience will have the joy of seeing all of this.<br /><br />Madeleine, in her own quiet, unassuming way is as much bigger than life as any of her heroes. Though she's compared to \\"Lady Day\\" ; Billie Holliday is just a point of reference for Ms. Peyroux. You might as well be comparing the Rolling Stones to Chuck Berry, or Bob Dylan to Woody Guthrie. The similarities are there but dissipate very quickly upon hearing enough of her music.<br /><br />\\"Careless Love\\" is one of the best releases of this year, and an enduring classic for any year.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I always envy my oldest brother because he was around when The Who release the legendary 'Tommy'. Or when the Clash release 'London Calling'. Seems to me like he was taking part on one of those rock'nroll history moments. At that time, I wasn't aware and understood the hype surrounded those mythical records, because I was still on diapers..:-))  I was 10 years old when Nirvana released 'Nevermind', that particular moment was also didn't quite catch inside my memory, even though my brothers kept telling me how great those record was. It was just one great blurry moments.    Years from now, I will proudly tell my son that daddy's around when the first commercial legendary opera-punk 'American Idiot' was released by the mighty Green Day. On 2004 at last, I was part of the rock'n roll history...
B000005IU1|5.0|There is a good reason why this is a bit of a mish mash compared to Fun House and Raw Power. It would probably be pretty fair to say that this album was pretty much rushed together, and after reading some stuff here and there you may discover that the initial version of the album had a few less songs, and those there were significantly longer than they ended up here. Has anyone noticed that when the songs end on this album, the song is kind of still going, they just fade out? (even in a couple songs just as a solo is starting)? Ron Asheton has said, for example, that Ann, in it's initial version, was over 8 minutes long, and here it has been cut to less than 3. I really hope those tapes still exist and we'll get to hear them some day. Anyway, the record company didn't like it (usual reasons, not commerical enough), so according to Ron, Real Cool Time, Not Right and Little Doll were written in the space of about 3 hours, rehearsed once and recorded on the first take. This isn't bad stuff though, by any means. It's just when compared to the classics (I mean Fun House, Raw Power) that followed it, it comes up a little short. <br /> <br />We Will Fall gets a lot of criticism, clearly because it's so inaccessible and different to the rest. If you're in the right frame of mind and prepared for what it has to offer though, I think it's great. Lie down, close your eyes and take it all in and it's damn eerie and addictive. <br /> <br />There's not much else to add really. A lot of these reviews are recycling the same information, but it's all true (well the good bits are).
B00005ASHM|4.0|There have been many great things written about this album and it tops many listeners' best-of-lists. I for one, love the album very much but something just gets in the way of my awarding it 5 stars ... the track Sloop John B.  <br /> <br />That tune was released as a single prior to the album's release and according to the liner notes in the boxset, the record company dictated it to be included ... as a marketing ploy. Trust the powers that be to go and f**k up a masterpiece in the making. What do people who only care about the bottom line know about art?! Just check the current state of the music scene and you will know what I am talking about. Poor Brian was probably under pressure to make the compromise. THAT song was never meant to be for Pet Sounds!  <br /> <br />Sloop John B. was not written by Brian; it was a folk song that the Beach Boys rearranged. It sounds pretty but it doesn't have the depth of the other songs on the album. Even the two instrumentals have more emotional resonance than this tune. To me, having this tune here mars the whole experience of the album and in my opinion, is even more tragic than Brian not being able to complete Smile back then (we now know that he has finally done so ... am waiting for my copy in the mail!). If Pet Sounds was perfect (as it is without Sloop John B.), the Beatles would probably have tried harder with Sgt Pepper's and kept the original concept that included Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane (again, the record company got in the way and forced them to release the songs as a single).  <br /> <br />Alas, in my book, the two (friendly) competing camps lost out in the \\"race\\" to make the best album of all time ... that accolade goes to Love's Forever Changes!     <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|2.0|So many reviewers are claiming the changes were small, insignificant. Maybe to those who have only seen the movie once, but to long time fans this will be a disappointment. Through out the movies you will find small changes in dialogue and word order. Most noticeable are the changes to Yoda famous quotes. The result is a movie which feels awkward to anyone who knows the dialogue well. Additionally the graphical updates often added extra background. In the cloud city, views of the outside were added almost haphazardly. The result is odd lighting and views that seem out of place, once again Lucas is becoming too dependant on technology. Also the DVD compression was not perfectly done. There are several places where smoke appears pixilated leaving an impression that the DVD was just not done right. Oh, did I mention, volume levels have also been changed, blaster noises are sometimes almost silent, while other times overwhelmingly loud. <br /> <br />All I can say is, \\"Lucas, I want the ORIGINAL SERIES back. Please???\\" <br />
B00005T30L|5.0|I just got to see the end of this movie last night.  I mean i have seen all the other parts exsept this!

B000002HK4|3.0|Although this will certaintly not be my last Dream Theater purchase, I was a bit disappointed after their opening 23 minute track. <br /> <br />Ironically, in listening to the \\"A Change of Seasons\\" song, I found  myself thinking that they must've been influenced by Pink Floyd and Deep Purple at one point... Well, they did covers of these musicians and more.  They weren't badly done re-makes, but they ARE remakes.  As far as I'm concerned nothing compares to originals. <br /> <br />I've listened to the whole album about 3 times, but I usually just shut the stereo off after track one.  If I want to listen to songs by Floyd, Deep Purple, Zepplin and others, I will listen to THEIR VERSION... the original.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Wow.  While I am normally a man of words with these reviews, all I can say about this film is \\"Wow\\".  After a very fast three hours, I was surprised, shocked, amazed, and excited about what I just witnessed.  Film God (if you don't mind me calling him that) Lars von Trier has done it again.  With each film of his that you watch, you can only be more and more impressed with the level of intelligence and passion that he has for his films.  Breaking the Waves was Trier's first film I ever saw, and I still think his story of unbounded love is gut wrenching.  It will make any grown man or woman tear up.  He successfully redefined the musical with Dancer in the Dark giving a platform for singer Bjork to show her talents.  Now, he has come full circle and directed a film that touches such a variety of different topics.  When you watch this film you will see images of women's rights, rape, slavery, depression, poverty, hatred, and justice.<br /><br />For those of you weak of heart, Trier does not sugar coat anything.  He gives us such a powerful stage to watch these actors do their trade that we cannot help but get caught up in everything that they do.  Dogville is a cross between \\"Our Town\\" and The Godfather with a twist of Trier's other films.  It gives us the story of a woman, passionately played by Nicole Kidman, who chooses to live in a town of corruption because she believes in the human spirit.  The human element is stronger than any evil.  Kidman, literally, gives the performance of her career proving yet again that she is not afraid to tackle any female role.  Her work has continually proved that women can be a dominant force in cinema.  This film is no different.  Add to the mix a powerhouse of independent players like Patricia Clarkson, Chloe Sevigny, John Hurt, James Caan, Lauren Bacall, Jeremy Davies, and Ben Gazzara and Trier's stage-like film is easily transformed into the cinematic event of the decade.<br /><br />To add to the superb acting, you also have the most creative eye in Hollywood today.  The silver screen could not be what it is today without the work of Lars von Trier.  His talent far exceeds anyone else in Hollywood.  If I could time capsule any film in cinema for others to find later, I think it would be Dogville.  From the delicious opening scene to the ending credits which will literally blow your mind and make you see true images of this nation, Trier does not hide anything.  If there is one director on the planet that I would like to meet, it would be him.  I hear he is such an ogre when making these films, yet the finished product is always nothing short of a masterpiece.  I still have those images and song ringing through my mind when the final credits rolled.  It was a completely different atmosphere than the rest of the film, but yet it worked and completely blew my mind.  Trier is the Picasso of the film world.  His art will challenge and destroy any preconceived notions while all the same making you look inside of yourself.<br /><br />This was the best movie made in 2003 with no further doubts in my mind.  To have a canvas that not only allows independent thought, yet covers a topic that is feared is a feat not taken enough in Hollywood.  The acting was phenomenal, the direction was crisp and focused, and the story was disturbing and powerful.  This film broke all other film boundaries.  While I still have trouble understanding every issue brought forth in this film, I cannot wait to watch it again and experience small town America.<br /><br />Bravo to everyone involved with this film.<br /><br />Bravo, Lars von Trier, Bravo!!!<br /><br />Grade:  ***** out of ***** (The best film of 2003!)have the most creative eye in Hollywood today.

068987474X|5.0|I thought this book was good! :) If you dont like this book thats your opinion!:P
0156027321|5.0|This book is marvelous!  The beginning was a little slow, but still interesting and after the middle part, I couldn't put it down.  I absolutely fell in love with Pi.  I loved his narrative.  The story kept me reading late into the night.
B000002KE2|4.0|Man what's going on here? <br />I keep reading reviews that are so complex and \\"interesting\\" I think I'm going to get ill. Let's be clear on a few key points: <br /> <br />This is straight ahead 1972 rock, ultimately very simple. <br /> <br />Stuffed with strong material, I actually enjoy it more than \\"Paranoid\\" but I know I'm flying solo on that one, this record delivers a complete picture of the state of rock in72.   <br /> <br />Lets cut the crud here.  <br /> <br />This is just another very good Sabbath record. No further \\"story\\" is required... Worthy of owning, for all of the above reasons.
B0002G2B2M|3.0|It just doesn't make any sense to me. It wasn't that interesting  and you had to figure it all out when you wanted to  watch itand not figure something out. I don't know if it was that good in theaters because it wasn't long before it came out. The Grinch is better. You'll just have to see what you think. The thing that made no sense was everything that went on inside of Joel's mind. This is very dramatic but if you do like drama, find out if you like it or not. It's all up to you.
B00008FRWR|5.0|This with out a doubt a classic PINK FLOYD album. This album is full of great songs solid from begining to end. It's got alot of stand outs like the instrumental \\"Marooned\\", a Richard Wright classic \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\", \\"Take It Back\\", \\"Poles Apart\\", \\"Lost For Words\\", and a couple of alltime favories \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\",and \\"Coming Back To Life\\" a must have for a true PF fan.
6304675348|5.0|Scream is very suspenseful and makes Scary Movie look like a chicken in a basement playing a styrophome piano. You see, Scary Movie took a totally opposite turn. It's  like the people who did that made Scream look stupid and they didn't know what  they were doing like Scream was stupid. It's not. I like a good movie that's cool. Let me give some advice and offence if you think this but: WHOEVER DIDN'T THINK THE RING WAS SCARY SHOULD BE SHOT.
0345350499|5.0|Maybe it is due to my passion for the Arthurian saga, but i couldn't put it down. I am in love with this incredible, fresh epic.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Despite the brief nudity and the decidedly adult themes of this movie, this ought to be required viewing in high school or junior high.  It's so hellish that it might just manage to scare some people away from drugs.  The four main characters start out seeming not so very different from people you might know.  But they gradually descend into a nightmarish downward spiral of drug addiction, and have their lives so thoroughly destroyed by drugs that it leaves you shuddering in mixed revulsion and sympathy by the end of the picture.<br /><br />(Spoilers) Ellen Burstyn's character ends up being literally driven insane by her addiction to speed-laced diet pills.  One of the last scenes of the movie is a heart wrenching scene of her friends from her neighborhood visiting her in the hospital, slack-jawed with shock and horror as they view the electro-shock treated, almost catatonic shell of the woman who had been their old and good friend.  Her son Harry, played by Jared Leto, nearly dies from his experience, and ends up losing an arm - he avoids going to the doctor so long for treatment of the infection that he's gotten from using dirty needles (out of fear of being arrested) that gangrene sets in and doctors have to amputate.  His friend, played by Marlon Wayans, ends up doing hard time when he's caught by the police.  But worst of all, perhaps, is the fate of Harry's girlfriend, played by the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly.  In her, most of all, you can see the terrible degeneration take place.  She starts out a normal girl who simply likes to have a good time.  Then at one point, when her addiction really starts to assert itself, she becomes desperate enough for drugs to sleep with a man she dislikes for money she can use to buy drugs.  She rushes from her liason with him, and barely makes it outside his apartment building before she throws up in disgust and revulsion at what she's done.  Yet by the end of the picture, so great has her desperation for her next fix become, that she is not only willing to give oral sex to a complete stranger for drugs, she performs live sex shows on stage in front of a howling mob of drooling perverts - and she is so far gone in moral degradation that her revulsion, along with her dignity, is a thing of the past.<br /><br />As I said, this film is grim and very adult oriented.  But so many young people are being hooked on drugs these days that it ought to be required viewing, for it is a harsh, unflinching look at what REALLY CAN HAPPEN TO YOU if you start using hard drugs, but it's one that isn't as alarmist and overdone as the infamous movie \\"Reefer Madness.\\"  For the past few of years, I have worked on the Norfolk Police Department, and even in that short time I have seen enough addicts to see how realistic this movie is.is not only willing to give oral sex to a complete stranger for drugs, she performs live sex shows on stage in front of a howling mob of drooling perverts - and she is so far gone in moral degradation that her revulsion, along with her dignity, is a thing of the past.

B0000542D2|4.0|This film took everyone by surprise in the early 60s; what should have been a quick knock-off to capitalize on the success of the Beatles instead turned out to be an innovative masterpiece that endures to this day.  The documentary feel and the use of the soundtrack were fresh when Richard Lester directed the film, although they have become cliche today.      The story itself is so slight as to be almost non-existent; we follow John, Paul, George and Ringo as they go about the business of being a world-class rock band--running from fans, living in hotels, appearing on television, etc.  Things are complicated by Paul's grandfather (Wilfred Brambell, who nearly steals the show), a troublemaker who misses no opportunity to sow dissension in those around him.  What keeps us watching is the charisma of the Beatles themselves and the high level of energy and joy in Lester's presentation./
B000002U8G|5.0|just notches out the wall. <br />do yourself a favor and buy this, i listen to it 3 times a day everyday.
B00006V9A0|3.0|The reviewer below is an awful excuse for a fan of Nirvana. Kurt preached empathy, and then you've got hanz below saying he wants to hunt donwn anyone who thinks Kurt was selfish for killing himself. This person's the prime example of why we have road rage and mental facilities. I think it'd be more \\"therapudic\\" for us all if we didn't have such wackos like hanz in society. Anyway, Nirvana's greatest hits album is a decent buy for everyone BUT Nirvana's fanbase that appreciates the band's more unconventional material like \\"Hairspray Queen\\" and \\"Anorexorcist\\". If you're like me and can see the beauty in these two insanity-laden noizfests, then don't buy this greatest hits release, because I'm sure you aleady have \\"YKYR\\". God, I miss Kurt.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I just bought \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" 2 days ago & it is possibly I like to think one of the most beautifully brutal albums to come out in the last year. A must have for any metal fan.
1881273563|5.0|This book was required reading of my fiance and I in pre-marital counceling. The book is AMAZING. It explains so much! It has become such a part of our relationship! I recommend it to anyone and everyone...they also have books for love languages in relation to children. It is a must, I can't stress this enough!
6305508550|5.0|(Not that the Citizen Kane was much to talk about IMO) <br /> <br />I REALLY wish I could give it 10 stars <br /> <br />It's so spot-on it's not even funny when you think about it and realize that your life goes by just like this, only you are not laughing in the similar situations in real life.
B0000017CA|5.0|Never before, or again, will there be a metal band like these guys. well, worth the money, because \\"when the kite string pops\\" is hard to find alot of places, and it's by far my favorite by acid bath. I am huge fan of acid bath, and that's because of the first time i ever heard this album. This is a great album, and a must have for true- non-mainstream, metal fans. this album is for fans who know real metal, if you arent a real fan, this cd is a good step in the right direction
B00005Q4CS|1.0|This movie is overhyped, period. It's utter trash, just like David Lynch's \\"Mulholland Drive\\". The only bright spot about it is that Jennifer Connelly stars in it.
0140042520|5.0|Jack Kerouac is every wanderers' fantasy author. A man who spent many years traversing the country back and forth, living virtually hand to mouth most of the time...sleeping under the stars, practicing yoga in the woods on a winter's night...there isn't much in his works to not set afire the heart of a drifter. <br /> <br />Though this novel has a lesser 'landscape' than On The Road, Dharma Bums is every bit as much of a journey for the author. At a time when one of his close friends had influenced his interest in Buddhism, Kerouac criss-crosses the country again, home for the holidays, and then back to California.  While home, he wanders to the woods time and again, to center himself with nature and his surroundings, and stays on through the cold months.  <br /> <br />Eventually, the thought of his friends and free-wheeling existence in California draw him back, where he finds some changes to the people he left there, but ever the chameleon, Ray Smith (Kerouac) assimilates himself back into the hive of Beats he holds dear. <br /> <br />Kerouac's writings especially appeal to the 'adventurer boy' I left behind when adulthood called. Though some might call Kerouac's existence rootless and irresponsible...there is something magnetic (to me) about the way he lived, at least how it is detailed in his body of autobiographical literature. And though I know his own personal demons are only partially displayed in his books....I still want to be Jack Kerouac when I grow up. <br /> <br />Dharma Bums is highly recommended as either an introduction or a continuation of reading this exceptional author.
B000002JSR|2.0|First off, let me say that I've been a big fan of this band since the 1970s. The first album I bought was \\"Physical Graffiti\\" when it came out in 1975 (I was in 7th grade). I used to think Led Zeppelin was the best band of all time but now I would easily say that would be the Beatles. Anyways, I just finished listening to Zep's \\"Complete Studio Recordings\\", which contains all of their studio albums including \\"Coda\\", and here's my take on the whole catalogue. <br /> <br />LED ZEP 1: good blues album <br />LED ZEP 2: good hard rock album <br />LED ZEP 3, LED ZEP 4, HOUSES OF THE HOLY, PHYSICAL GRAFFITI: The classic phase. They really could do no wrong during this period. \\"Led Zep 4\\" & \\"Physical Graffiti\\" especially hold up as being amongst the best albums in rock. <br />PRESENCE: The decline. \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" & \\"Tea For One\\" are classics but the rest is filler (although good filler). <br />IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR: different. a decent listen, and nothing to be embarrased of, but a sure sign that if they would of carried on into the 80s they would have started to suck. <br /> <br />And this brings me to \\"Coda\\". All I can say is why did they release this third rate garbage. Ok, I remember when these guys could have released an album of Polka songs and I would have thought it was the second coming, but you grow up y'know. This is tripe. It's almost like they were intentionally trying to be bad. Maybe it was a joke. That said, \\"Poor Tom\\" is a very good song and would have fit in nicely on \\"Led Zep 3\\". There is also nothing wrong with \\"I Cant Quit You Baby\\", it's just redundant. <br />If you buy the \\"Complete Studio Recordings\\" they add 4 bonus songs to \\"Coda\\" which are a million times better than the musical regurgitations on the original version. <br />Gave it one star for \\"Poor Tom\\" and one star cause it's Zep.
0375760067|5.0|My second reading of a Thomas Hardy novel was every bit enjoyable as the first, if not more.  Having a very limited background with this gifted author, it has taken years to appreciate his talents.<br /><br />The Mayor of Casterbridge starts with a very dubious event...concerning a drunken 'sale' of two persons by one Michael Henchard...bidding them a not-so-fond farewell; once Michael sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family.<br /><br />Flash forward 19 years, when a weary woman and her now-grown daughter appear near Casterbridge, searching for the woman's first husband, who has now become the mayor, and succeeded in keeping his 21 year pledge to abstain from drink following his grievous error years before.<br /><br />Susan Henchard, now the widow of a missing sailor, comes looking for Michael, and is surprised at what she finds. A sober, well-to-do, respected member of the community, and a leader.  A far cry from the man who bartered her away years before. Also new in town is Donald Farfrae, who, once apprenticed to hay and corn merchant Michael, becomes more than Michael bargained for.<br /><br />To tell any more of the plot would be to deprive a reader of numerous twists and turns that occur along the way to the conclusion of this wonderful novel.  Perhaps its due to a limited amount of experience with Hardy, but I found several jaw-dropping revelations along the way, and more twists than a television reality series.<br /><br />The story is never dull, nor is it mired in too much unnecessary detail or character introduction. Each of the 'dramatis personae' are well-realized, as is the notion that the past can always change the course of the future.<br /><br />For newcomers to Hardy's works, indulge in this page-turner, which is fraught with enjoyment. As this is a less 'dreary' tale than Jude the Obscure, I would recommend it as an introduction to Hardy's style...and a chance to meet a masterful storyteller..
B0002UXBD6|5.0|To me, and to many people out there, Green Day is a band that i grew up listening, and in the same process, grew up with me. I first started listening to them back in 5th grade, soon after 'Nimrod' came out. They were the first real 'rock' band i heard. 7 years on, on September 21st 2004, and hoping i would not experiance the same dissapointment of weary 'Warning', i rushed out right after work to get a copy of this record. What i got, was something i would have never expected. Green Day are back, stronger then ever. <br /> <br />To compare Green Day's latest effort to their previous efforts, is ridiculous. Green Day are humans, and just like anybody, they grow up. They go through life experiances which they carry into their music. The record, is somewhat based on the life of Billie Joe Armstrong, lead signer and guitariest of the famous threesome. The record is based on a character by the name of, Jesus of Suburbia. The record takes you through the journey of his life, and through serveral other characters, including his split personality, St. Jimmy, and the girl who he falls in love with, Whatsername. I will not say more, and let the music speak for it self. <br /> <br />To pick out songs from this record would be like taking off certain colors from a painting. This record is ment to be heard from start to end, just like a book. Green Day puts out thirteen (twenty-one) amazing tracks, which are not only good, but you will feel a connection to certain aspects of your life as well. Especially if you buy the special book edition and read the letters written, which will give you a more indept look and insight on Jesus of Suburbia life.  <br /> <br />Its good to see this amazing band still around and doing what they do best after so many years, and im sure they will carry on. Hats off to a legendary band, and the best record of 2004, and possibly, the 2000's.
0060930187|3.0|<br />Plath writes the way a surgeon would. Beautiful imagery as usual with Plath, a really good book. Yet, and that would be my reproach, it is so incredibly COLD, distant, unpassionate, almost inhuman. That probably fits with the mood but jeez, that book is depressing like hell, don't expect to \\"relate\\" or feel like you're less alone or something. It's perfect like diamond as a novel, but it's just as cold too. I might be a bit harsh here, for in fact there are passages that are not this cold, of course, but the overall mood is pretty scary. It chills you. But to be honest I think I should reread it because I read it like two years ago, so what I am talking about now is the impressions it left me with. And I remember it being cold as ice. It's as though the main character is some kind of desperate machine. Which probably is a good definition of depression (the mental disease, not your average being sad), so in that respect it's perfect.  <br /> <br />I think the book certainly deserves more than 3 stars, but it's so cold I can't get myself to give more.
B0000CABBW|1.0|I was forced to watch this film because my friend said there was nothing else to rent at the small video place, suffice it to say I would have liked to watch a cartoon better because that is exactly what this film was, nothing but an empty regurgitation of history which wishes to substantiate its greatness. Expecting it to be very bad, I sat through it and humiliated myself because of it. I had heard about it and that it was an art-house favorite, one can't begin to see why, it is really amateurish and doesn't tell anything new which hasn't been done in some extent by American films and most of the script is extremely weak and simplistic.<br /><br />Most everyone has been saying that this is so \\"original\\" but if you look at the history of American film, you can find many things which were borrowed. The film itself is unbelievable, and incredulous considering the lead role is played by a white little girl who doesn't really emphasize enough about the Maori culture, all she does is mop around in her sad state because her grandfather doesn't respect her because she is a girl. Not only is this film an aberration, but it insults all previous Maori culture because it pretends to be an modern artifact which wants to unite the past and the new, thing is, erasing the old ways isn't the way to do it.<br /><br />Males and females had distinct roles in early cultures and there was nothing wrong with that, that is how they survived until the modern world caught up with them and started removing pieces of their structure and eventually, they became integrated into the European world, which was quite a mistake, considering that is where Feminist theory had surfaced its ugly head. Most of the cast is played by annoying people who can't act, one example is the little stoner boy who is being trained in the martial arts by the grandfather, he doesn't even look like he should be there, he fights the little girl with sticks and it is the most contrived scene I have ever seen. Most of the film, if not all, is contrived in such ways. Because it is so simplistic and absurd, this film will move many simple minded dullards who can't see beyond it's pretensions, this film is evil in its most evident nature because it wants to be 'feminist' and contort the meaning of the past, so much like totalitarian states. I should warn everyone that most of it is very boring also and the ending is one of the most ludicrous things I have ever seen. Grade: Dof the film, if not all, is contrived in such ways.

0684800713|1.0|**EDIT from 2008**    I reread the novel and entirely changed my mind, and can barely believe I once wrote such a crappy, stupid review. Please entirely dismiss the following review: I had simply been a poor reader. Originally, I had given this book a single star, and I can't change it now, but I will write a new review for this and give it its due. All apologies for this horrid (old) review.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------    The original review, which shames me:    \\"I know I don't share the general opinion on this novel. But the fact is that I not only read the book, I also studied it in a university class, so my opinion is not based solely on a shallow reading, but also with deepened analysis and studies. This of course does not make me omniscient on it, but here's my opinion: this book is as interesting to read as reading touristic handouts. It is deeply boring and it really is about nothing (call it Lost Generation if you wish). I honestly don't understand why this novel should be so praised. Not much happens and what happens happens in a boring way.     Now, the bashing being done I want to say that there are other Hemingway books that are much worthier to read. I'd recommend \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" any time rather than \\"The Sun Also Rises\\". I was fairly disappointed by \\"TSAR\\", even with knowledge of the iceberg theory and all the other things related to Ernest Hemingway; in my opinion this does not save the novel at all, barely makes it worthy of  scholar interest. Now maybe I am wrong about this novel, but I'm only giving you my impressions of it.     Definitely not the classic it is said to be.\\"
B00005JMJG|5.0|One of the strangest and most downright heartwarming films to drift out of the States in the last few years, \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is - what? - an inside-out romance story of sorts. When Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski's (Kate Winslet) relationship seems to have hit the rocks, the latter chooses to, um, erase her lover from her memory. Joel, on discovering why his girl suddenly seems to have no idea - or interest in - who he is, decides to do the same, only to change his mind halfway through the procedure. <br />Much of \\"Eternal Sunshine...\\" takes place within Joel's head, as his every memory of Clementine is identified and erased - so providing an abstract and decidedly arse-over-backwards account of the entire relationship. Seeing his recollections of Clementine get literally stripped away before his eyes (one noteworthy scene takes place in a disintegrating building), he starts trying to find somewhere he can \\"hide\\" his love, flicking through childhood memories for some mental cranny sufficiently far from the erasers' reach. Clementine becomes a childhood friend, a family acquaintance, and then... ooh, I've gone cross-eyed. <br />You'd struggle to find a love story more poignant, or a more telling meditation on the nature of both relationships and memory - the way that disconnected events bleed into one another, that one recollection can spark another. Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is as audacious and intelligent as you'd expect and, in former music video auteur Michel Gondry, he's found a director more than capable of realising his vision. \\"Eternal Sunshine...\\" is an almost embarassingly rich treasure trove of elegant, perfectly-conceived visuals. <br />There's enough human drama for your biscuit, too. Carrey (nervous, deflated, refreshingly de-smugged) and Winslet (whimsical, outrageous - and, Lordy, you've gotta dig that ever-changing barnet) come across like chalk and cheese, but their performances are touching, nuanced andoddly loveable. Props to the ever-reliable Tom Wilkinson, too - seen here as the (apparently) mild-mannered doctor behind all this mind wiping malarky. If his support crew (Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and - put those dewy eyes away! - Kirsten Dunst) prove rather less compelling, it's probably just down to unfairly stiff competition. Well, with a central story this weird and compelling, who needs groupies?
0142000663|5.0|This is one of the most impressive book I have EVER read. It's long, painful, intense. It leaves a mark on you. Honestly this book is just nothing I can correctly comment on by doing anything else than standing mouth wide-open looking stunned. It is one serious master-piece and you won't go through it safe. By the time I was finished I was a nervous wreck.<br /><br />One of the very best novel ever written, in my humble opinion.

0684803356|4.0|<br />If I had to recommend a single Hemingway book that would probably be this one. It's not your typical early Hemingway, and that's not a negative critic. The book is emotional, some passages are just really impressive. I think it's the one I preferred of all the books by Ernie that I read. <br /> <br />One thing that makes this book special is the direct speeches. If you read this book you will not fail to notice a certain touch of 17th century in the way people speak to each other. I thought I would explain the reason for this as it is not self-explanatory for people who are native english-speakers. Spanish is a language where you have two forms of second person, \\"you\\"; as in french, and formerly English. This is the difference between the \\"you\\" and the \\"thou\\", which is used in this novel. Formerly, the \\"you\\" was the polite form, and the \\"thou\\" the familiar form (not the religious form as many might think since the only use where you actually hear it anymore is for religious stuff). So whenever you see \\"thou\\" being used in the novel you know it means familiarity, as in old english. If I remember correctly, Hemingway also uses turns of phrases in such a way that it makes them sound \\"latin\\", the way it would be done in Spanish, which is the goal. This is a bit weird I have to admit but you'll get used to it, just keep in mind it's used to approach more closely the reality of the Spanish language, and thus have a better \\"translation\\". <br /> <br />Worth reading.

B00006J9OT|1.0|With the right band, arrangements, and producer, Krall could have been an excellent jazz singer, and on her earlier discs, she made strides in that direction. Apparently, however, Tommy Lipuma, her producer, has convinced her that success is more important than musical worth, and this disc is an illustration of what happens when a musician strives to be a pop star. Stock covers of \\"Just the way you are\\" and \\"The Look of Love\\" just don't fit with the other songs on the record, and were likely put there just for airplay or to pander to a boomer audience without any jazz knowledge.  In addition, her band has little jazz feel or swing on this record.  Example: The guitar solos by Anthony Wilson - he runs out of ideas after a couple of bars and ends up noodling meaninglessly for the rest of his solos - or the brush work by Jeff Hamilton, which really doesn't swing. <br /> <br />A jazz singer doesn't have to take a song at face value and cover it like a prom band - listen and watch Carmen McRae sing \\"Evergreen\\" and \\"With One More Look at You\\" on her live DVD (available on Amazon) at age 64 with a trio behind her and you'll see what I mean.
B000062Y98|5.0|You know those CDs that you get and think they are awesome so you listen to them all day, every day, for two weeks straight and then never listen to them again? Well, Blind Guardian's 'Night at the Opera' is the exact opposite. <br /> <br />When I bought this two years ago I gave it four stars because I recognized the epic scale of the effort. But I thought it was somewhat overbearing, especially with all the vocal tracks. I would listen to it now and then but eventually put it away for a year or so. Then a few months ago I was getting tired of the CDs I had been listening to over and over and looked through my collection for something I had not heard in a while. There it was - A Night at the Opera. I put it in and, for some reason, it just blew me away. <br /> <br />This is one of the best metal CDs ever to be released. Blind Guardian is so unique and talented that they are almost a genre unto themselves. If I were in one of the metalcore bands that are so popular (relatively speaking) today and listened to this CD, I would never pick up my instrument or mic again out of sheer embarassment.
B000092Q4U|5.0|First off let me say that lamb of god are my fav band.This is great but not as good as NAG because Randy's vocals on NAG rule. Randy Blythe is the best Extreme vocalist. Also AOTW is an amazing album.This has more of a death metal feel to it than the other albums. The riffs are great on all the album. Chris Adler is the best drummer on earth with his double bass. This sounds like an album for armaggedon. The guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler are amazing. The bassit John Campbell is great but can't really hear his bass on this cd, it is more audible on NAG <br />Best songs: <br />Ruin-Great song, amazing breakdown. <br />11th Hour-Nice guitars, has an evilish epic feel to it best lyrics on cd <br />Boot Scraper-Nice vocals and good lyrics <br />In Defence of Our Good Name-Nice riff  and great vocals <br />Vigil-Starts slow but gets heavier great riff. <br />

B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The USA and the world are obsessed by the CIA and other secret services and agencies that work in the wings of life under no control whatsoever. They circulate in the world as if they knew no borders, no limits and they carry on their business without considering in any way the people, the interest of the world itself. They have their objectives and it is to dominate and manipulate the powerful in the world and eliminate them if by any chance they became rowdy or rebellious. This film is no exception in the genre. An ex-agent from a totally secret group of « cleaners » has survived the end of his group and is hunted by some other secret agents, from Russia actually, to cover up an old operation that failed. This ex-agent is challenged in his « retirement » and gets back on the road to find the truth he has mostly forgotten and to eliminate those who are menacing him and have killed his woman-friend, his love. He finds out that the failed operation had been under scrutiny by the CIA and that he has been trapped into another failed operation. But this second failure was planned by the boss of the CIA himself because the documents the CIA was on the point of buying would have revealed his implication in the first failure as the one who organized the stealing of twenty million dollars by a future Russian oil-tycoon. His interest as the CIA boss was to push Russia into wild capitalism to undermine the power of the Russian state, and as an individual it was the financial kickbacks he got from this newly born oil tycoon. The ex-agent manages to go up the trail and get to him and, finding out what was his role in the first failure, he is able to force him to confess, on tape, and to commit suicide. Then he only had to evade the Russian secret services who are backing the oil-tycoon. He eliminates the agent who was tracking him, he apologizes to the daughter of the two people he executed in the first failed operation and he disappears again to finally come back to the new head of the CIA, the woman who had re-opened his file to find the truth about the first failed operation, and force her to classify his file and reveal him his true identity that he had forgotten due to the multiple identities he had had in his spying life. This film is pure action, and yet it entertains the vision of a democratic state that is totalitarian through some secret agencies that are there to prevent any change in the balance of power in our countries and in the world. Thus there seems to be some Big Brother behind the decor of our government from the people, for the people and by the people. The people appears in this film as a mass of non-significant puppets unconsciously strutting in the streets and other public places totally unaware of what is going on in their backs. And yet there is an escape for the ex-agent, an escape that is purely selfish and unethical because it protects him but reinforces the secret agency with the end of the challenge to it that he represented. It is a Big Brother that is multiplied into absolute and totally untouchable immunity. Frightening and sickening. And if it were true ? Stephen King, when dealing with such an agency, goes right through to destroying it, like in Firestarter. That is more reassuring for us : this secret agency can be challenged and curbed into some legality. In this film none of these ethics. Total fatality and acceptance.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUad of the CIA, the woman who had re-opened his file to find the truth about the first failed operation, and force her to classify his file and reveal him his true identity that he had forgotten due to the multiple identities he had had in his spying life.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore owes his entire career to the 1st amendment rights he so freely exercises. Bravo! He also owes the audience he holds sway over the right to have absolute truth told, in context, accurate and undiminished or flavored to suit his personal agenda. Unfortunately after analysis, much of Mr. Moore's efforts doesn't pass, or hold up under scrutiny. In that regard, it's merely opinion--conjecture and provides every viewer the opportunity to experience highly developed, dialectical based propaganda.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with the seriousness and nature of the subject at hand, propaganda does not serve, but detracts from matters of great import to our society.<br /><br />Opinions be had, Mr. Moore certainly has one. I can only hope that the masses that view this effort do so with the blinders off and preconceptions/misconceptions aside. You'll need it! F-9/11 is very convincing, except for one fact, which is that the average citizen will never really know the how and why, or the failures (if any). Why?  Because in adherence with national control over classified matters...we don't have the need to know. Anything else is merely thought provoking conjecture -- conspiracy theory, a waste of my time. Believe it, or not!
B000003TA4|5.0|I am a little disappointed in all of the 2 people who say this album is overrated.  This album killed off hairbands and provided an awareness of sound so that other bands like Soundgarden and Alice In Chains could get their message out.   <br /> <br />Unfortunatly when a great style of music is released upon the masses and unexpected success the corporations find \\"viable entities\\" that can boost their stocks a half a point!  If Soundgarden killed off hair bands, why did they break up and Chris Cornell sold out for audioslave?  If Smashing Pumpkins killed off hairbands, why did they break up so Billy Corgan could be in the \\"awe inspiring\\" zwan <br /> <br />Every track on this cd, although musically simple, had lyrics to back it up, and prove they were not kidding around.  Nirvana made music better for a short while, and sure the music that they inspired isn't exactly \\"great\\" but if you think about the quality of hair bands, there is bound to be something good on the horizon.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Great film that every American should see.  What is it about GWB that won't let people see through his BS?  I've said numerous times that if all these were just lies, why hasn't Mr Moore been sued yet?  He made over 100 mill and hasn't been sued?  Wake up people!!  The corperate ties are all lies?  The film clips of this guy popping his gums (in his own words), all lies?  The fact that this war, was the wrong war at the wrong time?  These are indefensible facts and occurances.  The debate last week showed that the man can't handle pressure on his own.  Kerry had him pulling his hair out, he started talking in circles.  Watch the film, check out the facts and make your own determinations.
B000003C2S|5.0|From the opening track \\"Living Monstrosity\\" to the scorching closer \\"Killing Spree\\" Death's third album \\"Spiritual Healing is a bit on the progressive side, but the band were able to maintain their trademark thrash/death formula as they would continue to do so on later releases such as Human and Symbolic (which were more technical sounding). Singer/guitarist Chuck Schuldiner's vocals are just outstanding, as he and fellow guitarist James Murphy (Testament, Obiturary) rip out dueling guitar solos after another. The rhythm section by bassist Terry Butler (who would later join Six Feet Under) and drummer Bill Andrews is just strong and fantastic. Great album, Death rules.
0192100289|5.0|I have read my share of mysteries but I can honestly say that this mystery is superior to any I have read because it offers superb insights into the human condition through interesting, vivid characters.<br /><br />The plot is tightly woven (throughout the 500+ pages of this volume) and the pieces of the mystery fall together most oconvincingly.  Having read this, I imagine that other mystery greats (Christie for one) learned a thing or two about pacing and the psychological make-up of a crime.<br /><br />More than that, what I love about this book is the characters- especially Gilbert Betteridge, who is a funny, quirky first narrator and the detective who loves roses above crime.  Collins' book also struck me in that he writes female characters who are multi-dimensional and interesting, as opposed to some other Victorian authors of his day.  This is fantastic!  I recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery but and also  wants to understand human nature and read a well-written novel.
B00006RCSU|4.0|If you are more inclined to mathematics or sciences you probably will find this adaption of Shakespeare's classic rather strange.  If you are into theater, art or literature analyzation you will love it.<br /><br />The concept of keeping the same early modern english language and putting it into our times seems absolutely nonsensical, but I found it the oppostie, where in fact it is more clear to understand the language when it is set to something that would appear familair to us.<br /><br />The actors are actually fantastic, a young Leo and Claire make the perfect teenage Romeo and Juliet who were supposed to be about 14 anyway.  They look as innocent and in love as Shakespeare intended it.  I really liked Claire Danes as Juliet because you were watching Juliet, you weren't watching a famous actress play Juliet, you know?<br /><br />While Baz Lurmahns direction style canbe a bit eccectric, it certainly isn't as flashy as Moulin Rouge but still, the color and camera shots are sensational.  I'd see this film for the scenery and sets, etc alone.<br /><br />I think it getsa bad rep because people expect to see a new age Romeo and Juliet.  Ok, wrong.  You will get the same gorgeous language the play MUST be spoken in, but the backround will be modern and colorful, however this always seems strange to some people.<br /><br />It's an english major's dream because of all the imagery and symbolisim.  I loved it.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Moore adds an emotional punchline to the bizarre and disturbing tale of a hapless president propelled to power by a shadowy radical cabal. The tale would be almost unbelievable if not for the fact that reality -- e.g., the catastrophe in Iraq -- intrudes rudely into the neocons' fantasy world. It's hard to believe that anyone could steal an election. We don't want to believe it. But as we watch the unfolding of recent events and the president's addled campaign performances, we find that our disbelief begins to wane. Fahrenheit 9/11 only began the process of demystifying the web of intrigue surrounding the Bush administration. To Moore's credit, he serves up just enough detail to move his audience. Unfortunately, there's alot more where that came from.

B00005JMAH|5.0|I have been reading with amazement some of the half baked reviews of this movie, and I can't help but wonder who actually watched it?  As has been often mentioned, this is the most deftly plotted of the novels--no fat, all momentous story.  Cuaron faced a difficult challenge in bringing it to life...but he faced up to it and did a brillian job.  I very much enjoyed the first two movies, but ultimately, they seemed to be simply a little too \\"crammed\\".  In trying to capture all of Rowling's Wizarding World, Columbus was too slavishly faithful to things which were better enjoyed in the books.  Cuaron trimmed some of the pieces of the story that wouldn't make for good visuals, and then told a great story using a marvelous visual language.  His color palette was subdued but beautiful.  The acting from Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe was, as was to be expected, fine.  Each did a nice job, and in certain moments managed to shine above their probable abilities--a certain testament to this director.  Emma Watson (?forgive me if I got her name wrong) (Hermione) was marvelous, and she is likely to have lasting merit as an actress.  The special effects were just that--very special.  THey were not used wantonly, but rather placed where they needed to be.  Pacing was marvelous, exciting and rapid.  The symbolism of the clocks was somewhat heavy handed, but also quite visually striking.  Music was great.  This is easily the best movie in the series.  To folks who say that it scared their five year old, I reply, what in heavens name were you doing bringing a five year old to this movie?  It is PG for pete's sake.  It is meant to be enjoyed by people over the age of 10, and probably over the age of 12 to be completely safe.  Younger ones will cry, because the effects are truly scary.   <br /> <br />The other stars were excellent as always.  Casting Emma Thompson was a stroke of genius.  Alan Rickman was chilling as Snape, and the replacement for Dumbledore (Michael Gambon?) was seamless and turned in a very nuanced performance.   <br /> <br />Do you love harry potter?  Then this is the film you hoped they would make.  Not for the little ones, please.  Definitely for those with an eye to a great story and impressive visual communication.
B00005JNEI|4.0|While not as scathingly hilarious than Bowling for Columbine, Farenheit 9/11 sets out with a clear, albeit biased objective. Getting Bush out of the oval office, this coming November.  <br /> <br />Bowling for Columbine is mainly subjective and mainly about the discussion of how the 2nd amendment affects America as a whole and its consequences behind gun ownership. It did contain a morsel of Bush whacking, but that's it. <br /> <br />Here, Michael Moore brought out all the big guns. From Bush's allegedly and dishonestly stolen the electoral votes from Al Gore, to the 9/11 tragedy, the follies of the Patriot Act and culminates in the debacle known as the Iraq War Part 2. Moore gnashes and chews his way to portray Bush as one big dumb Texan cowboy who hides behind his daddy's boots. <br /> <br />Propaganda or not, Moore still present a credible situation in which Bush is absolutely the wrong man for the American presidency.  <br /> <br />The DVD itself is packed with extras. Even though, I didn't quite like the film itself (Yes, I consider this a film, not a documentary), it works more like a newsreel to me. However, the extras could prove to be interesting. For a more insightful view into this film, read \\"Dude, Where's my Country?\\" by Moore, Farenheit 9/11 was practically being adapted from this book wholesale.

0767817486|5.0|I love this movie I can't believe how many people think it was based I would love to see some of these reviewers spend a night in a Turkish prison back in the early 70's and then tell me about how nice their prisons are unless you been there and no what your talking. I know not all turks bad but their government I don't know if it's the same now as it was back then. Could the film have inacuricies of course what movie doesn't. I bet you people who gave bad reviews would give Osama Bin Laden a big sloppy kiss if you met him.

B00006JDU9|3.0|\\"The Phantom Menace\\" isn't what everyone expected it to be.  Die-hard Star Wars fans were expecting another \\"A New Hope.\\"  Casual fans were hoping to get more of the whiz-bang adventure that was presented to them in the initial trilogy.  Folks relatively new to the Star Wars phenomenon were left wondering what the big deal was over all of these films to begin with.<br /><br />What we were actually given was a typical, contemporary, over-budget sci-fi flick that had great intentions and huge shoes to fill.  Perhaps George Lucas let his delusions of grandeur go to his head.  Perhaps all of the Star Wars geeks placed him on such a tall pedestal that all he could do was fall.  Maybe he just ran out of ideas.  No matter what, I think it is safe to say that this film was doomed from the get-go.  Even if it were the greatest film ever made, it will always be in the shadow of the original trilogy.  The second film, \\"Attack Of The Clones,\\" probably benefited from this fact since it is not the first film in the new trilogy and the standard set by \\"Menace\\" isn't that high.<br /><br />There are few memorable performances from this film.  Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson do well as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, but I couldn't connect with either of them in this film like I did with Alec Guinness in \\"A New Hope.\\"  The kid who played Anakin Skywalker was a little bit annoying to me.  I'm glad to see him out of the picture.  Jar-Jar Binks was raped by critics and fanboys alike, but I have to admit that his oafish comedy actually helped me trudge along through this film.  As a matter of fact, the character that I disliked the most was the one that no one would stop talking about:  Darth Maul.  For some reason, I got the feeling that this guy was forced on us in the hopes that he would achieve Boba Fett-like legendary status.  Boba Fett had few lines, but people fell in love with him.  Maul has a few more lines, and I hated him.  Both of them were supposed to be sinister warriors and feared opponents.  Both of them had cool costumes.  They each had a neat sounding voice.  But in the end, Boba Fett's popularity came unexpectedly.  Maul's fame came by way of commercialism.<br /><br />The special effects were excellent, though they worked against the original trilogy in that the technology looked billions of light years ahead of the original films.  How can you fly around in clunkers after you've had such fancy ships as Amidala's cruiser?  The lightsaber battles were enjoyable, but without Vader or Luke in them, I felt somewhat cheated.  The android troops seemed to be more efficient in this flick than the slow-minded stormtroopers in the original series, but the stormtroopers had something to them that cold androids with guns lack.  Stormtroopers screwed up and they looked funny doing it.  These androids try to drop one-liners, but they aren't funny at all.  In fact, they gave the Jedi bigger problems than the stormtroopers.<br /><br />In all, things just don't add up between the original trilogy and this new one.  Sure, these new films are adequate, but they will never be as good as the original ones for the simple fact that they are sequels to the originals.  The standard set by the original series is almost unreachable, but I'd love to see Lucas come as close to that standard as possible with the \\"new\\" third film.<br /><br />I recommend this to folks who merely need a base for the original trilogy or fans who are willing to look beyond the shortcomings of the new flicks.  Average movie-goers may not see what's so special about the Star Wars mythos, but if they view the original films, I'm sure they'll understand.and feared opponents.  Both of them had cool costumes.

B00028HBKC|5.0|We all know that Jesus was crucified for our sins but I don't think we could ever have imagined the brutality, ignorance and sheer brutality that accompanied it. This film is extremely violent and I watched it while my daughter slept. The images are disturbing and ones that you won't be able to burn out of your memory. I've never felt more connected to any other actors in any other movie ever. I especially connected with Mary who endured an unbearble torture that no parent should ever have to suffer. The crowds who gathered to watch feed off each other and are filled with people who want blood. Connections are made with some sympathizers and I felt their empathy and their horror and fear. Even at the end when Jesus is on the cross and his tormentors still do not relent he delivers the line which moved me most of all. Jesus looks up towards the heavens and asks his Father to forgive these men for they know not what they do. There are many gruesome scenes such as the nails being driven in or the crown of thorns being twisted on his head. After watching this I couldn't think about anything else for hours. While some may not agree with the way this moment in history is portrayed here I reccomend everyone watch it. It is a film that will stay with you and one that will make you think about your beliefs. I'm glad that Mel Gibson went against the odds and put this out there so even if we don't agree who is to blame the actual horror of it all is put out there for us to understand.
0393035158|3.0|Sam Harris' unflinching look at the danger to society posed by religious dogma will not sit well with a majority of people. Either did Galileo's claim that the earth circled the sun, for which the Inquisition promptly convicted him of heresy.  Sometimes the majority gets it wrong... very wrong.  <br /> <br />There is no escaping the fact that throughout history, blind obedience to religious dogma and the pervasive hate it often gives birth to, has resulted in the unspeakable deaths of millions of innocent people. The slaughter continues to this day.  Sam Harris correctly points out that the inescapable drum beat of intolerance by the self-righteous defenders of faith, most notably Islamic extremism of late, presents a clear and present danger to modern civilization. He makes a compelling argument that the taboo that immunizes religon from closer scrutiny ultimately robs us of open minded and energetic discussions about the legitimacy of its practices, indeed the legitimacy of its very existence. <br /> <br />Perhaps most controversial is his claim that benign practicioners of faith help perpetuate, by their very existence, the more extremist elements of religion. <br /> <br />Mr. Harris' book can be a challenging read for the average person which is unfortunate since its message needs to be heard by the masses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001GQC|5.0|Claudio Abbado' is definitely one of the greatest Prokofiev conductor of all time. His recording of the Peter and the Wolf in collaboration with Sting really gives a nice, delightful touch, as well as the Classical Symphony, often given a bit loose, heavy performances by even the most eminent maestros such as Karajan.<br /><br />  In this album too, Abbado gives a defining performance on the more serious, dark, and thrilling music by Prokofiev. In the Alexander Nevsky Suite, based on a 13th century Russian hero who led his troops to defeat Teutonic invaders, the climatic battle on ice is especially a thrill. The chorus  sings \\"Peregrinus expectavi\\" with ice cold fright and as dark as siege, and high paced tempo really drives the audience. And in the Scythian Suite, the equally savage Dance of the Dark Spirits is as powerful under Abbado as it should be.<br /><br />  On the other hand, the more brighter Lieutenant Kije Suite restore the charm the maestro gave when he did Peter and the Wolf.<br /><br />  Try it out and I'm more than positive that you'll really get blown away.

We applauded your attempts to expand your screen image with risky roles such as your kooky, driven part in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  And we admired the way you jumped into working with an amazing array of directors, everyone from Von Sternberg to George Sidney to John Carpenter.  TOUCH OF EVIL was another favorite of your fans.<br /><br />In addition, you brought forth into the world two other excellent screen actresses, Kelly and Jamie Lee Curtis.

B00005JMH2|3.0|We rushed to see the sneak preview of the 'Shall We Dance' re-make because the original (Japan, 1997) is one of my favorite movies.  And while this is a nice enough re-make (essentially re-done shot-by-shot), it fails to come close to recreating the one special force that drove the original: that lead Koji Yakusho's (Richard Gere's role here) flirtation with dance flies directly into the face of every societal more in Japan, most notably the 'salaryman' death-by-overwork culture and idea that the 'upright nail gets hammered down.'<br /><br />Yakusho has a palpable battle with demons throughout the film and has every logical right to keep his new passion a well-cloistered secret.  In contrast, the best the screenwriters can do for Gere's John Clark is that he appears to be mildly depressed (undiagnosed) and at a loss to how to articulate that fact.  Still, he's depicted as being in a loving, open relationship with his wife (nicely played by Susan Sarandon), and there's nothing in US society on the equivalent to Japan that would compel Gere's character to have to keep dance classes a buried secret.  As Sarandon says, \\"if you wanted to dance, why didn't you ask me?\\"  And, indeed, I think it really is that simple.<br /><br />Beyond those concerns, there are two standout roles worthy of note here:<br /><br />- Stanley Tucci is fabulous as Link Peterson and an alter-ego that no explanation here can do justice<br /><br />- Jennifer Lopez, in a role she was born to play.  There's no camera trickery here.  That's her on the dance floor.  And kudos to her and/or her advisors for seeing professional ballet dancer Mai Kishikawa's turn in the original and realizing how well Lopez could embody the look and spirit of a lonely dancer staring out a window.
0345451325|3.0|I, like most people, was enthralled by the video game, and I bought the book. As far as background information, it was too good. So good, in fact that most of the infromation, I believe, belonged in the game itself. The first part of the book, which tells the story of the Master Chief's childhood. Not surprisingly, even at the age of six, he demonstrated physical leadership over his kindergarten mates. After that, it talks about his and his fellow spartans' developement into soldiers. John, of course, displays the most brilliant tactical mind of them all. <br />Ah...Where have I seen this before!? Ender's Game! that's all the book really is, just a remake! all the important background information about the spartans, the pillar of Autumn, etc. belonged in the game itself. Not a book that you need to pay an extra 6.99 for if you want the full story
B000001EHS|4.0|I am NOT alone in my recognition of many notable 'omissions' this particular 'Greatest Hits' package left out.  Is this a great CD to own, especially if you love Def Leppard?  Absolutely.  Does it truly cover their entire career?  NO WAY.  Let me explain:<br /><br />Absolutely NO songs from their 1st album.  WHY??  Just because they had no charted single from 'On Through The Night' does NOT mean it had nothing worth including.  'Wasted' and 'Hello America' are the two obvious choices that were left out.  A true waste.<br /><br />'High 'N' Dry' is arguably Leppard's best album, and my personal favorite.  It was this cassette I borrowed from a friend which got me hooked long before 'Pyromania' ever hit the record stores.  Despite all this, only ONE song was included??  And an edited version at that?  For ALL true Leppard fans, when you hear 'Bringin' On The Heartache' you EXPECT to hear 'Switch 625', just like we ALWAYS expect to hear 'We Are The Champions' immediately following 'We Will Rock You' by Queen.  This particular axe was simply a MAJOR screw-up on the part of whoever produced this collection (most likely the record label, and NOT Def Leppard).  Other songs from this album that were left out: 'Let It Go', 'Mirror, Mirror' and of course the title track -- but easily they could have added 5 or 6 tracks and made this CD 100% better...but NOOOO.<br /><br />'Pyromania' and 'Hysteria' were Leppard's most successful records released during the 80's, a Decade where ONLY Michael Jackson sold more records (check it out, it's true).  Consequently, these albums receive the most attention on this collection, but SIX songs from 'Hysteria'?  Even though it was a phenomenally GREAT album, they could have left off a couple of these songs to make room for more from the 1st & 2nd records.  I am absolutely stumped why so MANY of the best songs were simply ignored?  I have worked almost my entire adult life in radio and I am at a loss to explain this incredibly obvious mistake.<br /><br />One thing we Leppard fans CAN look forward to, and I feel I can say this with a certain degree of confidence, is that eventually the band will get together and spear-head a TRUE Def Leppard Collection, similar to the vast number of Anthology CD's that have been dumped on the market over the past decade or so.  It will most certainly be at least a two CD set, possibly three, and will include the songs us major fans have been wanting.  It just may take a little longer than we want, but it WILL come, mark my words.  Until then, my advice is to simply BUY the full albums and make do.take. <br /> <br />One thing we Leppard fans CAN look forward to, and I feel I can say this with a certain degree of confidence, is that eventually the band will get together and spear-head a TRUE Def Leppard Collection, similar to the vast number of Anthology CD's that have been dumped on the market over the past decade or so.

0399103422|5.0|If you thought the movie was great wait till you read the book. The Godfather is a brilliantly written story detailing the accounts of the mafia society and the Corleone family stationed in  New York. The novel takes place in New York, Long Island, Sicily, and Las Vegas throughout the 1900's. We are shown how a mafia family is run and the influence they have on the American society. The novel begins in one generation and continues on throughout the next generation of the Corleone Family.   <br /> Although the novel is quite similar to part 1 and 2 of the renowned Godfather series, they do have their own differences. A lot of scenes in the novel are not in the movie and the movie contains some scenes that are not in the novel. So don't be discouraged or afraid to read the novel if you've seen the movie because even though they are similar they are also different. The novel contains well crafted characters and provides a much more clearer and detailed account then the movies on the characters of Johnny Fontane, Lucy Mancini, Albert Neri and many other minor characters. In this novel, the author Mario Puzo uses a unique storytelling technique that makes The Godfather such a good read. He tells the story from many characters point of view and transfers from past to present and vice versa. The plot is intricately designed so that all the events are connected to and related to each other. The technique that famous movie director Quentin Tarentino uses is quite like the technique that Mario Puzo uses to tell this story. So don't miss out on this read because it truly is a masterpiece.  <br />
B000002PC6|5.0|If I had to advise someone who'd never heard of Olivia Newton-John, I'd mention this album. <br />This has some of Olivia's finest vocal performances on her ballads ( \\"Falling\\", \\"Carried away\\" or \\"The promise\\" ) - but this album is more known for his uptempo numbers : Landslide, the opning track, which amazed those whe knew Olivia then. Make a move on me, where Olivia delivers the words in quite a suggestive way. And, of course, the title track, which spent 10 weeks at #1 back then, and remains one of Olivia's biggest sellers. Other memorable tracks are \\"Stranger's touch\\", \\"Silvery rain\\" and \\"Recovery\\". Although not a favorite of mine, \\"Love make me strong\\" is quite good too. The only thing missing here are the beautiful Herb Ritts photos that were on the LP inlay. But this CD is worth it, just for the superb music. <br />
1573228737|5.0|I have just finished reading Affinity, not more than 5 minutes ago. This book was surprisingly intruiging to me, as I am not one to enjoy stories set in old time periods. I could not put this one down, however, and found the author's style of writing quite easy to read. <br /> <br />Having received this book in a bookcrossing.com book ring without knowing the exact pretense of the story, I went into reading it with several pre-conceived notions. Knowing that it was set in the 1800's, I thought that the text and storyline would prove to be difficult to follow. That could not have been further from the truth! <br /> <br />I will refrain from giving my synopsis of the book, as you should be able to gather that based on the excellent review entries above. I will, though, make some personal comments on some issues that personally spoke to me: <br /> <br />I understood the plight of our protagonist, Margaret, to be one of overcoming and/or enduring the challenge of being a lesbian woman attempting to find her place among the socialite set of 19th century England. She clearly had an understanding of being \\"different\\" from other women in her class, and felt considerable shame associated with her sexual desires. I think only her father understood her completely, and his death left her unable to envision a time or place in which she would feel free to be herself. Her realtionship with Helen (her brother's wife) was never expanded upon, but one can surmise that there must have been some sexual experience in their past that Margaret longed for, but Helen was unable to continue. After experiencing the loss of her father and the rejection of her lover, Margaret was lonely and vulnerable upon her arrival as a Lady Visitor at Millbank Prison.   <br /> <br />The ending was perfect, and I had not guessed what was to come before it was right upon me. The author did an excellent job of slow-dripping clues throughout the story that all made sense in the end. I can't wait for the rest ofthe members of this book ring to make their comments! I will be recommending this book to my friends and family, and also hope to read more work by Sarh Waters.
B00005JLEU|5.0|If this work of art does not move you or inspire you, I seriously must wonder if you are even alive.  Amazon.com's review is right on target - this is AMAZING.  This film is so deeply beautiful and refreshing it is nearly painful.  Have you ever heard music so heavenly and godlike it nearly causes you pain?  This is a similar experience.  Watching this is so refreshing, new, and different I really lack some of the words to describe it.  It is intelligent, very subtle and unlike most throwaway children's fare (which is crass, cluttered, disgusting and/or just haphazardly thrown together) this movie has the ability to profoundly move adults.  Much like Harold Budd's epic tone poems, this film is subtle, sweeping beauty.  A work of true imagination, a great escape from our cynical, industrial world.<br /><br />Are you sick and tired of kids cartoons that are gross and filthy?  Do you want to see something that is the ultimate breath of life, innocence, and joy?  Time for Miyazaki's Spirited Away!  Disney loved it, PIXAR loved it, the critics loved it, will you have the maturity and depth to love it?
B000002UB3|5.0|I was born in the mid 80's. All of those years of my parents saying the stuff my generation listens to is crap was more than reinforced when i bought all of the beatles albums and listened to them all back to front. I am embarrassed to be considered part of my generation, we are so shallow, such rebels but why? We have educations yet choose not to use it. Kids my age say they like nelly and stuff like that because its their anthem about drugs and they dont like the beatles cuz they are old and their music is so \\"i wanna hold your hand\\". Revolver and up are the drug anthems for kids my age and tehy dont even know it. I can't even give the beatles a true criticism, how could i or anybody. The english language has yet to have words that can describe something this amazing. The beatles are one of the few artists i can say i listen to most of their albums front to back with full enjoyment, and they are one of the few artists that can provoke tears for me.
6303212379|5.0|I might not be the biggest '80s nostalgia buff, although I did grow up in the 1980s, and I was 12 years old when The Goonies hit the theaters in mid 1985. The movie was a Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg production, which was set in Oregon (in Astoria and Cannon Beach, both on the north coast). I was still living in Oregon then, but in Eugene. Wonderful adventure of a bunch of middle school kids in search of pirate treasure, the pirate being One-Eyed Willy. They did this since their home was to be destroyed by greedy land developers who wants to build a golf course. The kids solve many puzzles and avoid mobsters (one of the Fratellis was played by Anne Ramsey, who two years later starred with Danny Devito and Billy Crystal on Throw Momma From the Train) as they reach the treasure. Great film that certainly reminds me of my childhood, and I highly recommend it.

B00005JNEI|5.0|OK, Knowledge is power. In a true democracy an empowered electorate can create change. If that democracy is the most powerful country on the planet, than THAT POWER CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE! No matter what you or I think the future belongs to whatever this country , our democracy, does every 4 years when we hold national elections. Like it or not you and I are responsible for the future! We can't decide who our political machines choose for us to vote for. We only decide which one of those machines rule. Like it or not,that is a fact! <br />     Facts are the big issue in this movie. Partisans on both sides of the isle want you to either believe or disbeleive the facts in this movie. There are no special effects in this movie, no Lucas film type computer graphics. In the end you have to believe what you just witnessed is true , or not. plain and simple. If you feel that Moore played fast and loose with his context of the events portrayed, than so be it. But the real fact is this: Our president is the one who distorted the facts. He is the one who broke Iraq. Secretary of state Powell is wrong. The president broke Iraq and WE BOUGHT IT! And the price is so precious! How will we ever pay for those who have been so tragically impacted. Can we ever? The human cost will never be justified. Never.  <br />    If you are a partisan Republican than you will never admit that your precious President could ever have been so tragically wrong. He could blow up your own neighborhood, or allow a hundred 9/11's to happen and you would just keep on worshiping him like you do on every sunday. How pathetic is that. <br />    Like it or not the facts will make this republic sound . When President Lincoln sayed these words he was absolutely correct. The future of this planet depends on US to have the knowledge and to forget our own little petty partisan nonsense. <br />    This movie gives Americans the version of the facts that FOX, CBS, CNN, NBC, ABC etc never had the intestinal fortitudeto show us. There is video on this DVD that you will never see on our television screens. Is it just me? or does it bother you as well that citizens of other countries saw these video clips and we didnt? Why did it take a controversial movie for us to see this footage? Why are we so obviously shielded from the FACTS?!!! I hope that EVERYONE gets to see this film and then decide with all your intellectual senses what to really think. <br />                  THE FUTURE DEPENDS ON IT!!!

1400032717|5.0|Beneath its unwieldy title, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is the story of an autistic teenager and his attempts to solve the mystery of a murdered neighborhood dog; but, of course, it's much more than that, too.  <br /> <br />Christopher is a fifteen-year-old, mildly autistic boy who lives with his father in Swindon, a small town about a hundred miles outside London. His mother has passed away several years ago of cancer, so it's just Christopher and his father. During the days, Christopher attends a \\"special needs\\" school, where lessons include not only the three R's, but also tips on dealing with strangers and decoding facial expressions (Christopher can recognize happy and sad faces, but more complicated faces give him trouble). For a project, Christopher's teacher tells him to write a book about himself. Adding his own individual touches along the way (a math prodigy, the boy numbers his chapters not 1, 2, 3, but as prime numbers in ascending order), and peppering the text with illustrative tables and drawings, Christopher embarks on a detective story about Mrs. Shears's dog, stabbed to death in her yard with a garden fork.  <br /> <br />Christopher's purpose in writing his book is to emulate his hero, Sherlock Holmes (whose logical mind he greatly admires), and solve the case. But his investigations unearth more about the relationships between his family and his neighbors than about the identity of the dog's killer. Unable to decode sarcasm, jokes, or figures of speech (he calls them all \\"lies,\\" since they aren't the truth), Christopher faithfully notes down his conversations and observations; though the reader, able to read between the lines, will guess the truth fairly quickly, Christopher's inability to understand social cues makes his struggle for answers all the more affecting.  <br /> <br />Constantly bewildered by the (to him) incomprehensible behavior of those around him, Christopher resembles nothing so much as a human plunked downon a distant planet, trying desperately to figure out how to interpret the language and behavior of an alien species. And, in a way, many of Christopher's conclusions and actions make logical sense; but because he lacks a normal person's ability to make intuitive connections or understand the unspoken, Christopher has to rely on the imperfect set of rules he's learned about human behavior. Which is not to say Christopher can't also be infuriating, with his startling rigidity and resistance to change; he's prone to loss of bladder control and groaning fits when confused or scared by his surroundings - which is rather often. Nevertheless, he's deeply sympathetic and intensely believable, even if (like me) you've never met an autistic person before.  <br /> <br />Other characters, such as Christopher's father and bereaved dog-owner Mrs. Shears, are realistically flawed and very convincing. They're not saints, by any means; Christopher's father tries hard to be patient, but can't control his frustration and anger, and all too often takes it out on his unresisting son. Mrs. Shears, for her part, is icily distant to Christopher. At first we assume that it's because of his insensitive poking into the death of her pet, but as the story progresses, we learn that her hostility stems from other, understandable (though not very noble) reasons. Obviously, Christopher's not responsible for his condition, and obviously he wouldn't have chosen to be as he is; but even though he can't help it, the boy is a heavy burden to those who must care for him, and frequent flare-ups of resentment and bitterness keep the story well away from saccharine TV-movie territory.  <br /> <br />Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't. His precise and careful prose reveal just enough to keep us a step ahead of Christopher - and give us an ominous sense of dark relevations waiting in the wings - while retaining a suspenseful mood throughoutthe narrative. In the end, though, the only mystery here is one that's beyond Christopher's, or anyone's, power to solve: how people can be so brutal, violent, and cruel to each other in the name of love. This is a wonderful book; you'll be glad to own it. Another recent, quirky Amazon quick-pick I enjoyed and highly recommend is The Losers Club by Richard Perez. <br />
B00005JN7O|1.0|is more like it--I love old movies and I love genre movies, but this is one of the only 3 movies I've walked out of in my life--first, this movie is such a ripoff of the Indiana Jones movies but has none of the things that made that series a success--this movie has a lame plot and lamer dialogue--for the 1st 20-30 minutes I was able to sit through, there was a hero who let his inseparable \\"love interest\\" boss him around altho she kept vital evidence hidden for her own self-interest EVEN THOUGH it ended up getting his sidekick captured, a villian created whole cloth from ancient Hollywood memories and modern CGI, a henchwoman with leather hair and zero charisma (altho I will admit Bai Ling is a ultrahottie, but who would know from this crud?), and cinematography that looked like it was filmed through a lens smeared with KY like a Penthouse Pet layout from the '70's, but the last straw was when I predicted what the \\"joke\\" resolution would be after the mine explosion \\"cliff-hanger\\" (who knew Nepal was near San Francisco?) and that's when I walked out--even \\"The Pirates of the Caribbean\\" was better than this slop but then again, \\"Pirates\\" had Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush and a real director that had previous experience with real actors--I was impressed with Jude Law's acting and he tried (hence the only star, along with the robots) but he ain't gonna be no Harrison Ford with this dreck! Save your money and invest it in the Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, or, yep, Indiana Jones DVD sets and maybe the next internet \\"filmmaker\\" who comes along will have the right idea!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw this movie twice in the theatres.  The first time truly was an assault to the senses and the graphic violence certainly there.  This movie seemed to grasp the intensity of the crucifixion. With the hype surrounding the movie, it was clear (pretty much to everyone breathing) this movie was going to be violent.   <br /> <br />However, I knew how the ending would turn out.  I was more interested in watching how Jesus' attitude was towards those involved in the entire crucifixion - Romans and Jews.  As I watched his face, I didn't see anger - but more like love.  Jesus was crucified prove God's love and save those who were doing the killing. <br /> <br />The second time I watched it was the Saturday before Easter Sunday.  I would encourage everyone to watch it at that time.  Walking into the Easter Service the next day I wondered why people weren't jumping up and down with joy.  Easter has always been a joy, but this movie helped to illustrate the point.
B0001YRVN4|1.0|OK...yes it's the Star Wars trilogy (the real one-the 1st one) .....yes it's on DVD...Great!...but now there are even more changes than the \\"special edition.\\" Why Does Lucas Feel He Needs To Re-Write History? As if (what were the) highest grossing movies of all time really needed to be altered. I don't get it...I'll never get it and I'll never like it. You don't see the makers of Star Trek: the Motion Picture throwing in a Borg Cube just for the hell of it...who knows maybe they will for the 30th Anniversary....or maybe Chris Carter will re-edit the 8th season of The X-Files DVD's to show Mulder in space during abduction just so when he reappears in season 9 it's really no big deal (i.e. Jabba in episode 4...that still ircs me) Whatever...waste your money to make Lucas richer and go out and buy this crime....I think if he really wanted to add these features they should have been bonus material or given a option (a la Beauty and the Beast DVD) and had given you a choice of: Original Theatrical Release; Special Edition; and Special Edition w/ Even More Crap Added(Beauty and the Beast gave a choice of: Original; IMAX; and Original w/ added song all on the same disk.) Whatever...I'm done...$crew you George....you just love pi$$ing off your loyal fan base don't you!?!?!?!   (God I'm such a fanboy...I never realized till I re-read this)
0393312836|5.0|It took me years to get around to reading this, because 1) I'd already seen the movie several times; 2) I was afraid Burgess' invented \\"language\\" would make the book a tough read. Far from it. There are really only about a dozen invented words, which are supposed to be the teen-speak of the time; and you don't even have to memorize them because their meaning is always clear from the context.     So is the book better than the movie? Well, they're very different underneath, even though their plots are superficially identical, and they're both brilliant in their own ways. Kubrick's movie is typically obscure and mysterious, and he leaves you to draw your own conclusions about its point. Burgess' book, on the other hand, is much clearer about its political stance. One good thing about the book is that its characters are in their early-to-mid teens, as opposed to the movie, where everyone looks around thirty, O my brothers.    The book is absolutely compelling. The violence is brutal, but not all that disturbing, because the novel takes place in a \\"dystopian future.\\" In actual fact, it's no more dystopian than the industrialized societies of today, or of the '60s or '70s; the book is an allegory of 20th century society. The novel is actually pretty short; it's a quick and easy, fast-paced read.    You're probably familiar with the plot; vicious little Alex, he of the ultra-violence and the in-out, in-out and the Ludwig van, gathers his droogs every night, and together they terrorize the decent folk after drinking their narcotic-laced milk. Eventually Alex is captured, and what little free will he has is removed through some kind of controversial aversion therapy. It's a relatively short but very strong story.    My only problem with A Clockwork Orange (the book) is that Burgess oversimplifies the causes of social problems. Burgess strongly implies at various points in the book that \\"free will\\" is an illusion; that little Alex, Your Humble Narrator, is nothing more thanthe product of society. His randomly violent behavior is not his \\"free choice;\\" he behaves this way because his peers do, and because it's the only logical way that society gives him to act. Again, I don't necessarily agree with this, but this is what Burgess implies throughout the book. In case you had any doubts, he makes it clear near the end, when the kind old guy who takes him in (the same one little Alex terrorized before his \\"rehabilitation\\") is also named Alexander. Burgess is saying that little Alex and nice old Alexander are the same type of person inside, just brought up in different situations. And at the end, Burgess throws in a chapter which Kubrick left out, which has little Alex realize that he's too old for the \\"ultra-violence\\" and the old \\"in-out, in-out\\" and decides it's time to become a respectable adult. Again, Alex does this not because he's \\"changed\\" or become \\"better,\\" but because it's what all his friends have done at that age, and what society expects. But this isn't really a flaw in the book; Burgess set out to make a societal statement and he makes it.     Burgess is a born writer; the dialogue and plot are far ahead of their time. The book was written in the '60s and feels not the slightest bit dated today. I may not entirely agree with its politics, but A Clockwork Orange may be the most vibrant and memorable book I've ever read.
0140177396|5.0|The book Of Mice & Men, by John Steinbeck, is one of the saddest and most moving books I've ever read. I could barely get through the fifth chapter without bursting, and when I'd done THAT I cried hysterically. I won't give anything away... but let's just say it's downright sad. This story is cyclic, which means it begins and ends in the same place. It centers around two main characters: Lennie and George. You can probably read the whole plot by scrolling up the page a little and reading under \\"synopsis\\", but I'll tell you some things anyway. There are a lot of other characters who go in and out of the plot throughout the story, and affect the lives of Lennie and George. George is very simple-minded, and he likes to pet soft things... like mice. This gets him into a lot of trouble in more then one instance, as you can imagine. A lot of people, especially 60 years ago, didn't understand Lennie's condition, and so this book gives a really good overview of the way people thought and felt and acted during that time period. There was a lot of cheating and a kind of every-man-for-himself attitude, but not with Lennie and George. That's what makes this story unique.  <br />The reason I titled my review \\"The hungry 30's\\" is because in school my English teacher is constantly reminding us on how \\"the book ECHOS the times of The Great Depression\\". And honestly, he's right, Of Mice & Men is just DRIPPING with grimy adjectives and... et cetera. You kinda get the picture from reading all the other people's reviews. It's true that this book is in the top ten banned books in the country list... but you know what? Last week (the week of September 26th thru October 1st) was Banned Books Week (I was told that Librarians get really pysched up about that)!  <br />So, I guess what you're all wondering is why on earth I'd give a book that got me so UPSET a five-star rating. Well, everyone (adults anyway) is always saying that kids today are so... jaded and numbed by the world and... videogames and the things we see on TV. I say, read more books like Of Mice & Men, and there will be no more numbness! You gotta cry your heart out once in a while... It's good for your soul.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This is so biased it's nothing but B.S.  It gets one star because zero stars was not an option.  This is so one-sided politically.  People who had a different opinion, the truth, were edited out of this. Michael Moore is a big fat liar.  And this is released right before the election.  Coincidence?  Let's hope Americans are not duped by this horse manure.
0765301598|4.0|If you enjoyed the previous prequels, you'll probably find little issue with this book.  The language is still stilted, the plot is sexist, and the use of names suspect (is Ticia pronounced Tisha or Teecha?--is one of many examples). If you were looking for ways in the which the authors would tie up loose ends so that we had a clear understanding of the roots of folding space, the Bene Gesserit, and other terms unique to Dune, they were done. Unfortunately, they were done either in the last 100 pages or spelled out so clearly that you didn't have to read ahead.  A strong action story shouldn't be one where we know a forgone conclusion, but how we reach that point.  <br />Here are some specific concerns: <br />*Erasmus, whose deeds were needlessly spelled out in gore, and who was the reason for the Jihad, died quietly. Dissapointing. <br />*Abulrud, for no reason, changes his attitude as the good soldier. This was clearly not strong writing <br />*The use of 2004 news and philosophy disturbed me the most. Human sheilds and religious zealots were not original.   <br />*The passion of Herbert's fremen was much stronger than Rayna, who the authors reminded us was \\"conflicted\\".  If she was so conflicted and the conflict not resolved, she wasn't needed. <br /> <br />If you're a Dune fan, like myself, the book does give us dreams of the future. <br />Finally, thanks to the authors: They didn't use the word FERAL on every other page as they had previously done! <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I saw this movie and when I walked out of the theater I was most angry at the news media. All the information that is presented in the movie was easily obtained by Moore.  <br />Why didn't the media show us????? <br />Why do we have to go to a movie to see what is really happening in the world? <br />I suggest every one should see this movie. It will make you laugh, cry, dispair, get angry, think, and hope; for yourself, your family, America, and the world.
B0000C8AV2|5.0|This is the first Bob Dylan CD I ever bought and kept and I bought it the year it came out.  Strangely enough, some local radio show in Northern California played a track off of it--Everything is Broken. I knew almost nothing about Dylan at this point. 2 years before, during high school, during I had ordered a Greatest Hits CD from BMG only to return it along with all the others.  I had given only a couple of listens and never got around to apprectiating or understanding Dylan, though I was aware of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and a couple of other famous songs.  When I went out to buy \\"Oh Mercy\\", I had decided my real exploration of Dylan would begin.  Amazingly, like almost all of Dylan's albums, I didn't exactly like it that much the first time I listened to it. (not unlike my first listens to a Miles Davis or Coltrane CD)  But it has grown on me over the years immensely and I'd put it among my top 5.   It's unlike anything else he's done.  I agree with someone who mentioned the \\"space\\" in these songs.  It is a space not only created by the subtly atomospheric production, but also by the songs themselves, the pauses in them.  Some of my favorites are:  \\"Ring Them Bells\\", \\"Man in the Long Black Coat\\", \\"Shooting Star\\", \\"Most of the Time\\", \\"Everything is Broken\\", \\"What Good Am I\\", \\"What Was It You Wanted\\".  I agree with those that say that this album could and should have been even better if the track selection had been different. I think a lot of Dylan albums could have been better for the same reason.  One of these days, I'm going to make my own \\"Oh Mercy-Reconsidered\\" CD, but there are no tracks here that I would give up--I would just add to it.  Even Disease of Conceit has its power--though I do understand the complaints against it.  I'm not one of those that feels that Dylan's 80's work is mostly shoddy.  I feel that if you have an open mind and you look for it, you will find treasures that even surpass his 60's work--though obviously in the 60's, the man was possessed like no else has since, including himself.  However, I'll have to admit that an openess to Jesus and the New, as well as the Old Testaments--and also ownership of \\"the Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3\\" is required to reach this estimation.  The songs here are not as strong for their word play or their poetry in the 1960's sense.  They are strong for a different reason: The music, the melodies, and the mystery.  This is an album tinged with a hidden, subtle, but deep spirituality.  I agree with those that have said that this is a beautiful CD.  It is.  You should get it and give it a chance--even if you're not a Dylan fan.  If you are a Dylan fan and don't have this--you will be rewarded. It's yet one more aspect of the artist in display and it you won't get this glimpse of him from any other CD of his that I am aware of. \\"Man in the Long Black Coat\\" is a haunting song.  It's mysterious, evasive, a little scary, very evocative.  I don't know if it's the first time it's done--probably not--but when he turns the metaphor \\"To beat a dead horse\\"--into a literal statement--the effect is scary delight:  <br /> <br />There's smoke on the water, it's been there since June, <br />Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon <br />Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force <br />Somebody is out there beating the dead horse. <br />She never said nothing there was nothing she wrote, <br />She gone with the man <br />In the long black coat. <br /> <br />Edgar Allan Poe would have liked this song! <br /> <br />Some lines that get me from \\"Shooting Star\\": <br /> <br />Listen to the engine, listen to the bell <br />As the last fire truck from hell <br />Goes rolling by, all good people are praying, <br />It's the last temptation <br />The last account <br />The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount, <br />The last radio is playing. <br /> <br />Seen a shooting star tonight <br />Slip Away. <br /> <br />Dylan's delivery is stirring.  If you're not a Dylan fan and have been told Dylan can't sing--this little known song will show you how unique his vocal talent is:  There's simply no one else who could deliver these lines this way in a native sense--they'd have to be trying to imitate him to deliver them this way.  Of course, for fans, there are countless examples of his gift--the way that meaning, melody, phrasing and delivery are wonderfully wedded. But \\"The last radio is playing\\"--What an image!--and what a way to follow up: \\"last time yo might hear the sermon on the mount\\".
B000002P74|4.0|I feel that Second Helping is Lynyrd Skynyrd's best album.  It sounds great and the production had improved over their debut album.  The album kicks off with Sweet Home Alabama, which became Skynyrd's most recognizable and popular songs.  'I Need You' is the next track, which is one of Skynyrd's more slower and beautiful songs.  'Don't Ask Me No Questions' is a good song about people trying to know too much about the music business and Ronnie's personal life.  'Workin' For The MCA' is a catchy song that Lynyrd Skynyrd wrote as both a tribute and a threat to their new record company.  'The Ballad of Curtis Loews' is a nice slow song that is easy to fall in love with.  'The Needle and the Spoon' is one of my favorite tracks on the album, and the guitar riffs on this song are amazing! The album concludes with 'Call Me The Breeze' which is a good cover song.   <br /> <br />There are several extra tracks on the album as well.  First is a single edit of 'Don't Ask Me No Questions.'  However, this song isn't very different from the original track.  'Was I Right Or Wrong' is, in my opinion, the best song on the entire album.  The lyrics are wonderful, and the song is very emotional.  The last extra is 'Take Your Time' which is from Ronnie's mother's point of view of her son growing up.  It's a very good song. <br /> <br />This album is some of Lynyrd Skynyrd's best work.  It's definately worth buying.
B000022TSW|5.0|THE PLOT:  A musical spoof about Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny!  The new Terrence and Phillip Movie comes out the boys MUST go see it, even if it means skipping church.  Unfortuneately, not only did that skip church, this movie makes them start cussing, ALOT (a spoof on South Park itself, and how they cuss so much!), and laighting there farts!  Every Sunday they skip church to see the movie.  OIne day, while lighting farts as seen on the Terrance and Phillip Movie, Kenny accidently lights himself on fire.  We think he's gonna die, but he lives.  Untill the doctors accidently replace his heart with a baked potato, even though they had no authorite or reason to operate on his heart.  \\"THOSE BASTARDS!\\"  Kenny dies and is headed toward Heaven, but because of his recent skippuing church and cussing ACCESS DENIED!  Kenny goes to Hell, where he discovers that Satan and Saddam are planning Satan's Anti-Christ reighn as soon as Terrence and Phillip are dead!  Meanwhile, back on Earth, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman find out that Cartman's mom was in a German porno.  This has NO effect on the movie.  Later that night when Cartman is dreaming, Kenny's ghost makes a quick visit and tells him of Satan's future reighn.  The kids think nothing of it.  They go to school cussing.  They get in trouble and go to cussing rehab.  They are just about to stop, but they get the rest of the day off to \\"reflect\\" and threy go and see the Asses of Fire again.  They install a V-Chip into Cartman's brain which eletrocutes him every time he cusses.  Stan gets grounded.  Kyle's mom starts a ban on all things Canada, inculding locking her adopted son Ike up in the attic.  They wage a war with Canada, which sparks a WW3.  During this WWS they attempt to execute Terrence and Phillip.  The Mole stops this, but he gives his own life doing it.  As the war sparks on the kids try and convince the parents not to kill Terrence and Phillip.  It doesn't work.  They kill Terrence and Phillip.  Satan comes out to rule the Earth as Anti-Christ.  Unfortuneatly, his gay lover Saddam Hussein trys to take over the assignment.  Kenny \\"says\\" that Satan shouldn't have to take that from Saddam and Satan kills Saddam.  Satan says that he garentees that Kenny will never have to go to Hell and gives Kenny one wish, no strings attached.  Kenny wishes for everything to be he way it was before the war.  It goes back.  And Kenny goes to Heaven.  The End. <br /> <br />Comic leval (dont see it, not funny, OK, funny, hilarious): HIALRIOUS.  I have never lahghed so hard.  There were times when I wasn't even laughing, just sitting there dumbfounded.  Asses of Fire was great, and the rehab song will always be a classic to me!   <br /> <br />Special Features:  They were good, but not plentyful.  2 theatrical trailers and 1 teaser trailer.  That's it.  They were funny and all, but not much more. <br /> <br />Conclusion:  Only for die-hard fans of South park, like my self.  If you don't like South park, don't watch it.  If you have never seen South Park, see it first, then decide.  I personally liked it, but I personally cannot speak for everyone, as it is an accuired taste.
031286504X|5.0|This was the first collection of Matheson's I have read (although I have heard of this novel for years).  I have to say, bravo!  I am going to get the rest of the books he has written.  It is amazing to me that stories that were written 40+ years ago can be as fresh as these are.  A highly recommended read for anyone who likes horror!
B00003CXCT|3.0|Why must Lucas keep tinkering with these films?  What detracts from the viewing experiences is that you aren't sitting down to watch three classic films, but instead you are sitting down to keenly observe where tweaks and minor modifications pop up (and these seem to occur plentifully throughout the films.)  The final change made to the very ending of Jedi makes absolutely no sense, but... whatever. <br /> <br />And would it really be such an ordeal to release the deleted scenes from the original trilogy.  I'm sure there are countless fans who would love to see these. <br /> <br />
B00008F21S|5.0|It's a pity that the Alan Foster book \\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\" never made it as a Star Wars film, and that George Lucas didn't take his own character's advice - \\"You should never have come back!\\" - because not only are his prequels colossal bores, featuring [so to speak] leaden direction, insipid writing and phoned-in performances, and John Williams's most uninspired music [no surprise, really, given the material he had to work with], but in his grandiloquence he bethought of himself to tinker with the original trilogy.  Or rather the original 2, since I have scant liking for the third/sixth movie I not-so-fondly refer to as \\"Return of the Booboos.\\"  While in some instances the \\"improvements\\" were of a certain interest, others - particularly the ghastly corny overwrought \\"pumped-up\\" destruction of the Death Star - were more annoyance than enhancement, and it is truly a wonder that in the process of all that time and money spent on the project that Lucas did not deign to fix the error near the end of \\"The Empire Strikes Out,\\" which is the scene in which Vader inquires, \\"Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millenium Falcon?\\" wherein the characters were mirror-image reversed.  It must have been too trifling a matter for Emperor G's alleged greatness to consider, but a laughable oversight nonetheless.  Give me the original \\"Star Wars\\" and the revised \\"Empire\\" [since evidently that idiotic goof won't ever be fixed] - I could care less about which version of the \\"Booboos\\" I might have, since for me the highlight of that film was Lando Calrissian in command of the Millenium Falcon with that whoever-he-was in Chewbacca's place as they compassed the destruction of the Death Star East.  Considering the two strikes of \\"Menace\\" and the \\"Clones\\" with their dull-as-dirt titles and offputting character/place names, this \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" [it took 20+ years to overcome whatever trepidations there had been about that being the title of the \\"Booboos\\"] holds no promise of the kind of rollicking good scifi fantasy entertainment the original two provided.  I can still at least hope that John Williams can climb out of his Dennis McCarthy-tainted spiral and compose a score worthy of his previous efforts, though it might well underpin another galactic yawner filled with the bland taste of George.  With anything approaching luck, that will be the last such we'll be subjected to by him.
B00028HBKC|3.0|You have to wonder if Mel Gibson doesn't have a serious torture fetish.   <br /> <br />After all, his Oscar-winning \\"Braveheart\\" ended with Scottish rebel leader William Wallace being disemboweled and ultimately beheaded.   Though that film featured enough  blood and flying limbs to rival your average zombie movie, Wallace's torture was mostly left to the viewers imagination since the camera didn't actually show blades connecting with flesh. <br /> <br />This is not the case with \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" which shows, in gruesome detail, the scourging of the Messiah and his eventual crucifixion.   I have to wonder, did it really need to go so far over the top in these scenes? <br /> <br />Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the Bible knows that Christ suffered for our sins but with \\"The Passion\\" Mel Gibson seems to be saying, \\"Hey kids, Christ really, really, REALLY suffered for your sins.\\"   I know this and can accept that as Gibson's interpretation of the gospel.   But I still find myself wondering,  \\"What was the point?\\" <br /> <br />This is not to say that the film is bad.   The direction and cinematography is excellent and the performances are uniformly superb.   Plus you have to admire Gibson's tenacity and unwavering commitment to getting this film made his way even as major studios ran from it in fear of its explosive subject matter.   The film could just as easily have been titled \\"The Passion of Mel Gibson\\" given that this was clearly a labor of love project, which as we all know by now has paid off handsomely for him. <br /> <br />As of this writing, \\"The Passion\\" is one of the top 10 grossing films of all time and still climbing. <br /> <br />But you still have to wonder if, in focusing so much of the film on Christ's brutal last hours, if Gibson didn't blow an opportunity to present an even more intimate and eye-opening view of his life.   To me, some of the film's most interesting scenes are the flashbacks earlier points in his life.   During these scenes we see his interaction if his disciples, with Mary Magdalene, and with his mother Mary.   <br /> <br />In fact, one of most fascinating scenes is one depicting Christ at home building a table and then sitting at it to discuss his craft with his mother.   I wanted more scenes like that. <br /> <br />Of course, many could argue that this would have made for a much different movie.   Maybe.   But it might have also resulted in one an even better one as well. <br />
B0002VKZL6|4.0|I have been a fan of Mark Knopfler since the days of early Dire Straits. I believe that Mark is the best guitarist in the world today, and possibly the best of all time. He is a consistent triple threat: he is an amazing guitarist; a gifted songwriter; and a unique and talented singer and performer. While I like this CD (any Knopfler work is worth owning and listening to repeatedly) I have to admit that I find \\"Shangri-La\\" to be a bit less interesting and certainly less musically diverse than previous efforts.<br /><br />The CD, as you would expect, is immaculately made with Mark's trademark signature perfectionism on prominent display throughout. If I can use one word to describe this CD it would be \\"understated.\\" The songs are a fairly homogenous lot and are with a couple of exceptions an easy going blend of rock, folk, and funk. Unfortunately, for those desiring to hear traditional Knopfler soloing, prepare to be disappointed: there is essentially none. The songs universally are identifiable as Knopfler fingerpicking masterworks, but this time he chose to be essentially a rhythm guitarist. That's not necessarily a bad thing; it is just different than his previous efforts.<br /><br />As always, individual song preferences are a matter of taste, but I actually found a couple of the songs to be overtly boring (\\"5.15 A.M.\\", \\"Whoop De Doo\\", \\"Our Shangri-La\\"), and one of them unpleasantly crude (\\"Don't Crash The Ambulance\\", the last song on the CD, which as the closing track left a bit of bad taste in my mouth.) My favorite song on the CD (and one that a lot of people have panned in their reviews) is \\"Song For Sonny Liston\\". I also enjoy \\"Postcards From Paraguay,\\" which is the least homogenous of the songs with its touch of flamenco flavor (and a very out of character yodel from Mark.) I found the lyrics on \\"The Trawlerman's Song\\" to be a bit formulaic and uninspired, but found the concept of a song (Boom, Like That\\") dealing with Ray Kroc, founder of McDonald's, to be an original subject for a Knopfler tune (although a couple of the rhymes in the song seem a bit forced to me.)<br /><br />It's always great to have new material from Mark, and I am delighted that he is apparently healed from his motorcycle accident. (Let's hope for a tour in 2005...) Overall I like this CD, but honestly do have to say that I will probably not play it as much as my other Knopfler/Straits CDs: it's not bad, it's just a bit more sedated and solo-deprived than I personally prefer.to be an original subject for a Knopfler tune (although a couple of the rhymes in the song seem a bit forced to me.)  <br /> <br />It's always great to have new material from Mark, and I am delighted that he is apparently healed from his motorcycle accident.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|What a waste of time. If it wasn't for decent acting and cinematography I would have enjoyed root canal better. Come on, those that write and direct should be judged on their own merits, not just because of who they are related to. Having been in Japan before I can attest that it is a \\"foreign\\" place for us Westerners but a better script could have made this a more endurable movie. If you have time to burn, see this flick. If on the other hand your time is valuable, see a movie written and directed by proven talent.
630463949X|5.0|I grew up with FM. Rumors came out the year I graduated high school so it held and still holds a central place in my soul... I have to say that as much as I loved the recent Live in Boston I think this DVD shows the band at its very best... Why? While time had helped them all to heal and get healthy there was still enough \\"fire\\" there to drive them all. The emotions, the turbulance that made Rumors, e.g., the 3rd biggest seller of all time was glaringly apparent in SILVER SPRING. Right from the beginning as Stevie's eyes FLASHED in THE CHAIN you could tell that all that raw magma was still there just below the surface... Seeing Lindsey pour his heart out in BIG LOVE and GO INSANE was stunning... The cap to all of it with Chris singing SONGBIRD reminded me so much of the story of how the song originally ended up on Rumors... <br /> <br />Altogether an amazing piece of work. For those who slam Stevie's voice - well, all I can say is that it's doubtful they ever did like FM. Her voice is fine. No one who's been singing for 30 yrs sounds the same. Bonnie doesn't. Sade doesn't. Even Sheryl Crow's voice has changed over time... <br /> <br />\\"As you slowly go away from me... This is just another test... Did I ever really care that much?

B00002SSRZ|3.0|Santana is awesome and Abraxas is one of a handful of my all-time favorite albums.  On hearing of this dts release, I immediately ordered it. <br /> <br />What a disappointment!  The separation of instuments and parts is terrific, but all the punch and soul of the music is missing from the bass and lower percussion.  This is a stereo album/CD that you can rock to.  The dts version is interesting but lifeless. <br /> <br />It sounds to me like the engineer who mixed this may have misdirected some of the main parts to the rear channels (which on most systems are set at lower volume levels) and simply forgot to include the bass or to punch the bass for dts.  The center channel frequently is quiet instead of maybe sharing the main instrumentation or vocals with another channel.  Anyway, the result is an unfortunate mix that leaves this listener wondering if they really spent much time on the project.  Did anyone at the studio actually listen to this before they released it? <br /> <br />I think I'm being generous with 3 stars; if it hadn't been THIS album I'd have given it one star. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|Apart from not having the choice to view the original prints, this is a must for any Star Wars fan. If Disney's Beauty and the Beast can have three different versions on ONE disc, there's no reason why fans can't have all versions. Other than that, the movies are crisp and clean...
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|A movie starring fine actors such as Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne, and directed by Clint Eastwood, should be a can't-miss opportunity.  For the first hour and 15 minutes or so, it seems like the movie is going to deliver -- the story is laid out methodically, without plodding, and the acting is superb, even if Mr. Fishburne is criminally under-utilized.  Then it all falls apart. <br /> <br />I won't give away the plot or the ending, but safe to say what you think you are watching for the first half and hoping to see resolved takes a bizarre and contrived twist, and the resolution is so wholly unsatisfying that you feel cheated for sitting through this two-plus hour film.  Great talent, wasted.
B00028HBKM|1.0|There is no doubt that Christ suffered, but there is absolutely no biblical or historical evidence for much of the content of this film. Impressive visuals and sound cannot change the fact that this effort is overloaded not with historical truths, but with Gibson's fantasies. Of course he has the right to display his version of events, but the rest of us need not be fooled.
B000003TBP|3.0|We tend to forget the musical influence of certain albums, and I think it partly has to do with taking for granted the genre it paved the way for. Now we hear it all the time, eg, Beta Band, Mull Historical Society, Badly Drawn Boy, but it was Beck's 'Odelay' that brought this type of quirky type of cut-and-paste experimentalism to the mainstream. It definitely embodied new musical possibilities, and all the accolades, praise and boy-wonder genius tags Beck received were certainly deserved. 'Odelay' is basically turntablist blues, folk, jazz, and country, meaning that Beck fused the latter four genres into an ecclectic mish-mash, all under a hip-hop/turntablist-type approach. Krautrock experimentalism is nothing new in music, but Beck was the first one to create a hybrid under the guise of patchwork-like hip-hop. This CD is basically a musical palate of smokey grooves, neo-psychadelica, world-music rhythms, pieced together with the meticulous yet daring touch of a DJ. Beck the risk-taker. 'Odelay's' genius is in combining musical styles that shouldn't go together, but in doing so creates something completely unique and innovative. A the time of it's release, this CD was a musical zeigeist, and this reviewer continues to recognize it's importance.
B0002UXBD6|4.0|Who'd have thought it? The same three cartoonish clowns that titled an album \\"Dookie\\" and sang about \\"Pinhead Gunpowder\\" may have the best album of 2004 on the table with \\"American Idiot.\\" Green Day suddenly abandons three minute two chord blasters and writes a play in 13 acts. Maybe they decided it was time to show upstart kiddy punkers like Blink, Sum or Avril exactly just how it's done.<br /><br />All right, I'll admit the \\"cartoonish clowns\\" comment might be over the top. After all, I believe the lyric \\"Do you have the time to listen to me whine about nothing and everything all at once\\" is one of the most brilliant opening lines to a 90's song. That was almost 15 years ago, and some maturity had to creep in somewhere. Politics would come into play as well, and the title track suddenly ditches the old backdrops of mental wards and tweaking binges to shout at the \\"subliminal mind-fk America.\\"<br /><br />As soon as that rant ends, we are thrown into the twin tales of \\"St Jimmy\\" aka \\"The Jesus Of Suburbia\\" and his battle with his dual personalities. There are plenty of the usual three chord havoc bangers here, but more sophisticated arrangements appear in \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" and the ballad \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams.\\" The suites of \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" are the best \\"Punk Opera\\" concept pieces since the mighty Husker Du roared forth with \\"Zen Arcade.\\" Like that classic album, Green Day are out to prove that there is more to the world of punk than the preconceived notions and spiky haircuts.<br /><br />For those still longing for \\"Kerplunk\\" etc, those albums are almost twenty years old. Get over yourselves, the band is grown both artistically and physically since then. They probably identify with the stuck in the past girlfriend who writes Jimmy (in \\"Letterbomb\\") \\"Where have all the (...)gone, where have all the riots gone\\" just before she walks out on him. For Green Day and Jimmy/Jesus, like the great lot of us, the mohawk cut disappeared when the bald spot became more prominent. But that doesn't mean the Green Day creative brain fell out along with hair. They haven't caved into recording an album of standards, and that is something to be thankful for. Add on that Green Day has managed to crank out an album as diverse and powerful as \\"American Idiot\\" without abandoning much of what made them originally great (and Billie Jo just seems to sing better with every album) is cause for celebration.<br /><br />Four and a half stars.prominent.

B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore's \\"Fahrenheit 911\\" was one of the first documentary movies to take on the lies and evasions of the Bush Administration. It created enormous controversy earlier in 2004 when it was released. The DVD version, coming out just a month before the presidential election, is likely to exhume the same emotions that surfaced this spring.<br /><br />\\"Fahrenheit\\" is not a perfect movie. Moore's approach is to illustrate his points via stunts, not all of which work. Cornering US reps to get their kids to join to the military makes the point that reps are not terribly willing to put their own families on the line in the war on terror. But then, few Americans have had to sacrifice (yet) in this war. Though it has its moments of humor and absurdity, \\"Fahrenheit\\" is more frightening than funny; the stakes are too high. While it may be humorous to hear Congressman Charles Dingell \\"lecture\\" Moore about how our reps don't read the bills that come before them, it's pretty frightening that this is the case. The Patriot Act -- rushed through Congress with barely a reading and barely a debate -- being a case in point.<br /><br />That being said, Moore does provide us with well-executed (and frightening) snapshots of early-21st century America and its top leadership. Watching President Bush sit for 7 long minutes while reading \\"My Pet Goat\\" to a bunch of gradeschoolers said a lot about his purported leadership abilities. Witnessing the enormous protests in Washington at Bush's Inauguration made me wonder why I had not seen these images before. Seeing a mother, who had lost a son in Iraq, assailed in Washington, DC by a true Bush believer spoke volumes about the desire of many citizens to maintain their rosy view of Bush \\"values\\" and policies in the face of contrary evidence. Hearing American soldiers screaming in agony after an attack brought home the human cost of the war, which has been suppressed by our leaders. Listening to an Oregon State Trooper describing the budget cuts that have left a long swath of coastline unprotected brought home the degree to which Bush has actually left our homeland less secure than before the 9/11 attacks.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Moore is a polemicist -- he is trying to influence the thinking of Americans who would rather not believe the duplicity and danger of the current administation. But being a polemicist doesn't make you a liar, as many of Moore's detractors would have us believe. \\"Fahrenheit 911\\" is an important addition to the currently muffled voice of protest and truth. Moore has done an exemplary job of bringing his point of view into public consciousness.a long swath of coastline unprotected brought home the degree to which Bush has actually left our homeland less secure than before the 9/11 attacks.

B00005JN7O|4.0|Making this movie required more than technical skill - it required chutzpah and guts on a monumental scale. Ultimately, the film makers' reach exceeded their grasp, but it was a wonderful effort. <br /> <br />The movie is all style - a 1930's alternate universe with all the sensibilities of classic comic books and film noir. The characters are all stereotypes with a few nods to modern sensibilities. <br /> <br />If you can immerse yourself in its world and appreciate the skill and artistry that created it, you can have a good time. But not everyone can do that, so they should avoid it. I'm old enough to remember some of the early serials from which it draws its inspiration. I was also fortunate enough to have seen it in a wonderful theater where they played old B&W Flash Gordon serial episodes between showings. I'll probably next see it on DVD where I can take in all of the peripheral tidbits I missed in one viewing. <br /> <br />Conditionally recommended.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|After reviewing the listing of performances it looks like whomever was in charge of producing this release did not follow the official concert agenda and opted to not include all of the music. I'm happy that an official release is on the way but disappointed that more care was not taken to include all the music in the correct order and also when VH1 showed the \\"10 years later\\" there were some comments from the artists and also the fans like the girls with U2 that should have been included. It could be that the producers think 20 years later nobody will care but obviously they don't know how many of us fans of this event are out here. It could have been 5 or even 6 discs and cost a little more I don't think anyone would have minded.  <br />

B0001Z52RU|4.0|Ashton Kutcher takes a break from playing his usual goofy doofus and takes a more serious approach in this time-travel thriller from the writers of \\"Final Destination 2\\". Kutcher is Evan, a good-natured kid who seems to be suffering from blackouts. He uses a journal to document the events surrounding them in hopes of better understanding them. Many years later when he appears to have conquered his childhood problems, he decides to take a trip down memory lane and discovers that he has the ability to travel back in time by reading the journal entries. When he suffers a fatal tragedy in his life, he uses his newly-discovered powers to alter the past and subsequently change the future. Of course, the more he tries to change things the worse things get. Despite a lot of the negative criticisms the film received, \\"Butterfly\\" is actually an effective take on a classic Ray Bradbury tale. A good deal of the film is disturbingly sadistic and contains a good deal of scenes involving kids being hurt, kids hurting each other, and even kids hurting animals. Despite its far from uplifting content, it's a lot better movie than it gets credit for. The DVD contains two different versions of the film, the theatrical version and a never-before-seen \\"director's cut\\" with an alternate ending.
0393035158|5.0|Brilliant!  I can't put this book down.  Everytime I finish reading it, I want to read it again.  Sam Harris should win the pulitzer for this.   <br /> <br />For atheists on the sidelines, this book will really help you get onto the playing field of public discourse.  I know it has helped me.  After reading it I've been challenging faith wherever it appears, from family events to newsradio talk shows. <br /> <br />For religious moderates, it's time you take your justified doubts about religion to their logical conclusions.  I really hope this book will help you get there.  Humanity needs you to wake up and be extremely critical of all the horrific actions that can result from taking a literal reading of the Koran or Bible.  I'm glad you are \\"failed-fundamentalists\\" but it would be so much better if you were loud voices of reason. <br /> <br />Silence in the face of irrationality, only adds to the irrationality.  Hopefully, Harris' trumpeting call for \\"The End of Faith\\" will be heard by the rational and irrational around the world.

B000002A3T|4.0|The second studio album without Roger Waters marks the return of Keyboardist player Richard Wright(who Waters fired in 1978), and shows just how important his piano and organs were to Floyd's early success. His piano shares the spotlight with David Gilmour's guitar on several songs. So aside from Roger Waters, the classic lineup has been restored. (A session player named Tim Renwick handles bass duties here.) <br /> <br />The songs: <br /> <br />Cluster One: Ambient instrumental piece, the first of many duels between Gilmour's guitar and Wright's piano. <br /> <br />What Do You Want From Me: Hard driving track with guitar parts reminiscent of Dark Side. A gruff Gilmour fires back at those who have called him a sellout for soldiering on without Waters. <br /> <br />Poles Apart: One of three songs that most likely to bring to mind classic Floyd. Mostly acoustic, with a big solo at the end.  <br /> <br />Marooned: Another instrumental duel between Gilmour and Wright. Sounds like something from a movie. Won a Grammy for best instrumental piece. <br /> <br />A Great Day For Freedom: Piano ballad, apparently about the fall from the Berlin Wall. <br /> <br />Wearing The Inside Out: 6.5 minutes of Elton John balladry. Some think it's too mellow, but it sounds quite beautiful. Wright sings on this one. His voice is very ethereal, and the female backup singers on the chorus are icing on the cake. Gilmour gets TWO solos, and Dark Side saxophonist Dick Parry does the intro. And being a Wright composition there's some nice piano work. <br /> <br />Take It Back: Okay, this one sounds an awful LOT like something from Genesis. Why Floyd would want to emulate that particular band is beyond me. <br /> <br />Coming Back To Life: Starts out slow, then goes mid-tempo. Cool opener from Gilmour. <br /> <br />Keep Talking: Another \\"Classic Floyd\\" style number, this one has a cameo from Steven Hawking. The female backup singers are back, and there's a bass line reminiscent of Waters. <br /><br />Lost For Words: Acoustic number about making peace with one's enemies. A rather infamous barb(involving the F word) shows up near the end. <br /> <br />High Hopes: The big epic closer, clocking in at over 7 minutes. Sounds like a cross between Comfortably Numb and November Rain by Guns N Roses. <br /> <br /> <br />Pay no attention to the critical lambasting, this is a strong post-Waters effort. The band may have shed the concept album format for more straightforward college music, but with Waters gone they're able to be a band again, regaining the musicianship that was missing in Wright's absence.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Moore starts with doom-and-gloom predictions about what a continued G.W. Bush presidency will mean to the U.S.; by definition this is propaganda. For people looking for a justification for antiwar/anti-American activism, this is a fair attempt, but don't try to verify the \\"facts\\" presented -- it is not possible in a real world. They must be verified using other fiction works. <br /> <br />From the flight from the country during nonflight time to altered statements and forged documents, Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' -type effort seems to have no more reality in its perspective. <br /> <br />If you want a fun party movie, this may be one in a stack. If you want a documentary (Moore himself admitted that this was entered as a \\"documentary\\" at Cannes only because that was one classification in which an opening still existed), try something like Grasping for the Wind or something educational rather than a far- far- far-left panic piece. <br /> <br />We all look for justification for our nuroses, but this is probably the wrong one for most.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This news look at the how George Bush and his administration have destroyed America is so important that I will be buying multiple copies of it to show on TVs wherever I see them in public.

As this news documentary shows, Bush is unpredictable, weak, mean, indecisive, unlikeable and can't be trusted. I'm so sad about this, I don't know what to do.
0671027387|2.0|The writing style is predictable and full of uninteresting flat characters.  That itself wouldn't necessarily kill the book as it is billed as a \\"smart thriller\\", not the next Anna Karenina.  But the book fails to live up that expectation.  It is full of plot holes, factual errors, and highly unlikely chains of events.  Virtually nothing in the book seems even remotely believable.  Dan Brown clearly forgot to do his homework on this one.

B0001KZM3O|3.0|Alot of people say this is the swan song of the classic lineup, but this is not true. By this time, Richard Wright had already flown the coop, and David Gilmour and Nick Mason were not involved in the creative process. This is a Roger Waters/Michael Kamen project. It seems that Waters committed that infamous cardinal sin that Axl Rose(Guns N Roses) and Zack De La Rocha(Rage Against The Machine) are said to be guilty of: he forgot that there's a big difference between a BAND and a solo artist with a bunch of hired guns.    As always this is a concept album. Waters is venting about the death of his father in World War II(\\"When The Tiger's Broke Free\\") but the central narrative here, from what I've gathered, seems to involve a WW2 veteran named John. Describing himself as \\"One Of The Few\\" to land on his feet, John returns from the war a hero(\\"The Hero's Return\\"), haunted by the death of a friend who dreamed of peace(\\"The Gunner's Dream\\") and having difficulty readjusting to civilian life(\\"Paranoid Eyes\\"). Disheartened to see succeeding generations acting selfish and corrupt, he turns his anger on their leaders(\\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\"). John's final pleas of social responsibilty fall of deaf ears(\\"Not Now John\\"), leaving him to wonder if the sacrifices made during the war were in vain.    If David Bowie were doing this, then he'd make it a point to make sure the musicianship was strong enough to match the concept. Unfortunatly, the musical foundation is perfunctory, it's as if Waters considered it to be inconsequential. Waters-minus-Floyd and Floyd-minus-Waters both had strong material after this, but that doesn't help this album. I guess everyone was having a bad day.    So you might want to listen to this one first.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson proved his mettle as a director with the epic, \\"Braveheart\\", the story of William Wallace, the Scottish warlord who united his countrymen against their British oppressors.  The most striking elements here are the staging of the battle scenes and excellent cinematography.  That said, if Gibson hadn't assembled a decent cast the technical attributes of the film would be meaningless.  Gibson does solid work here as Wallace.  Naturally, villainy is more of a challenge as an actor and Patrick McGoohan as Edward I(Longshanks) is more than up to the task.  After viewing this film I was compelled to research the historical accuracy of some of the events in the film.  For instance, Wallace and his men never sacked York.  One of the film's contrivances is a possible tryst between Wallace and the Princess of Wales which is highly unlikely since she was about 10 years old at the time events in the film transpired.  These issues are addressed, however, in Gibson's extremely engaging commentary on the DVD.

0066214122|4.0|Halfway through the Penguin Classics' version of Les Miserables I decided- I need a break. A break from the huge pages of print this small [pinches thumb and forefinger together]. A break from Hugo's monotony. Don't get me wrong, it's a great book, but my gods, it was a heavy read. So, I went down to the bookstore and decided to pick up a copy of Michael Crichton's \\"Prey\\", which I'd seen every time I went. <br /> <br />It's a good story, finishable by the avid reader in a weekend. An enjoyable summer read, a lively thrilling novel up there with Lincoln's \\"Utopia\\" and Crichton's own Jurassic Park. Yeah, it's cheesy, but still good fun for its make. <br /> <br />Crichton's lively descriptions of the desert and the swarm are very descriptive. The story is laced with humour, and I felt myself grinning many times throughout the story at the character's predicaments. <br /> <br />The whole thing is blended up well in a fast-paced and throroughly entertaining novel. I suggest it to all readers, and you may spend less time in front of the computer reading book reviews.
B00006690G|2.0|After Eminem's first 2 albums he really did show a lot of potential and i wasnt ashamed to say i liked his music even though i was and am a die-hard pac fan. But this album is a BIG step in the wrong direction for Eminem, just when things were looking up for him, he had the rap world at his feet and blew it with this album full of songs containing nonsense and meaningless songs which appeal to the younger generations, the only plus's on this album are 'Say Goodbye to Hollywood' which he does show the potential of his talents, and the song 'Till I Collapse' which relies heavily on Nate Dogg's chorus to keep the listener's interest. Overall a poor display by Eminem who seems to have been consumed by the media and the attention on him, long live 2pac, Nas i think it's down to you now to pull the rap game out of the terrible terrible state it is in!
B00005ATQF|4.0|Stanley Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" falls just short of being a great film.  It had the unfortunate fate of coming out in the summer of 1987 on the heels of Oliver Stone's more personal account of the Vietnam War, \\"Platoon\\" and comparisons were inevitable.  Kubrick directed this film from a script in which he collaborated with Michael Herr, author of the Vietnam chronicle, \\"Dispatches\\" and Gustav Hasford whose novel, \\"The Short-timers\\" is the primary basis for the film(Hasford was something of a character in real life, having been charged with stealing hundreds of library books a few years after the film was released).  The opening scenes on Parris Island where the marines are whipped into fighting shape are brilliant.  The primary conflict here involves the invective D.I. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) who makes it his personal goal to make an example of the ineffectual recruit, Leonard Lawrence a.k.a Gomer Pyle(Vincent D'Onofrio).  This section succeeds in showing how it is the goal of the military to break down recruits emotionally and physically into a fighting unit.  Ermey and D'Onofrio are equally excellent in the their respective roles as polar opposites.  The next section of the film, the least effective, transports us to Vietnam, more precisely the city of Hue at the time of the Tet offensive.  This is where the message of the film gets somewhat muddled.  Basically this section contains a series of vignettes where dispassionate soldiers philosophize about the nature of war over a curiously selected soundtrack of vintage pop songs (\\"Surfin Bird\\"?).  I would surmise that Kubrick who was ensconsed in England during the Vietnam conflict does not have a clear message as to what he wants to say about this specific war.  What is impressive about this section is the construction of bombed-out Hue as rendered by production designer Anton Furst on an abondoned gas-works outside of London.  Furst later won an Oscar for his work on \\"Batman\\" and later committed suicide.  Thelast segment involves the unit being pinned down by an unseen sniper and it is effectively chilling, but like the Parris Island segment of the film, is not dependent on the politics of Vietnam.  The character who connects all of these segments is Pvt. Joker played by Matthew Modine whose deadpan delivery I don't believe is wholly effective.  What you have to bear in mind is that Kubrick made the definitive anti-war film in \\"Paths of Glory\\" and if this film were made by anybody else it would rate 5 stars.  Because of the higher standards that we place on Kubrick and he placed on himself in the canon of his great career it rates 4 stars.
0312263120|2.0|I'll keep it short.  There supposedly is an unbreakable code algorithm that could make code breaking by the government impossible.  If the author of the unbreakable code is murdered, another person publishes the code key world wide so everyone would supposedly have an unbreakable encoding for their Internet and email usage.  The problem is that if everyone has the code key to unlock the code, so does the government, which means the code is worthless. <br /> <br />On the other hand, if the government can get its hands on the code key, they will destroy it so it can't be used agains the good old USA.  This is additionally stupid because if the USA has the code key to an unbreakable code, that would be a coup of major proportions, and would ensure unbreakable communications exclusively for our country's government. <br /> <br />So, when the basic premise of your book is crap by page 52, where can you for a few hundren more pages.  The fun is sort of lost when the book doesn't make a bit of sense. <br /> <br />Dan Brown needed to do a little more thinking before he wrote this book.

The soundtrack is awesome (especially since I like the pieces in question).  The symbolism in this movie is fairly deep as well.  Overall great job.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Movies are not always so easy to review because all movies are not created equally. Some are big budget ventures whose sole purpose is to entertain. These are relatively easy. Despite a critic's personal feelings, it fairly easy to see that, for example, \\"Spiderman 2\\" is a lot more bang for the buck than \\"Lara Croft 2\\".  <br /> <br />Movies like \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" are harder to write about because they aspire to be art. Whether or not they entertain in the conventional sense is of secondary importance. `Art' is such a subjective thing. When a reviewer uses words like `masterpiece', `genius' or `brilliant', a red flag is raised. The opinion becomes very subjective. To me, \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is the most interesting American movie I have seen so far in 2004. It is also the best love story / romantic comedy I have watched in awhile. To you, the opposite may be true.  <br /> <br />The premise itself is simple. Joel [Jim Carrey] and Clementine [Kate Winslett], two eccentric people, meet and fall in love. They have a falling out, and Clementine resorts to a doctor [Tom Wilkinson] who knows how to erase all memory of Joel from her mind. Naturally, this leaves Joel dazed and confused. When he finds out the truth, the angry young man confronts the doctor and his staff. Forlorn and desperate, he takes the only logical course and has the doctor erase HIS memories of Clementine. The question then becomes whether or not true love can ever really be forgotten.  <br /> <br />The movie bounces wildly between past and present, between real memories and false ones. This is the way it loses some viewers because the plot is anything but linear.  <br /> <br />Since \\"The Truman Show\\", I've thought that Carrey is a remarkable actor who has been trapped by his \\"I'm so funny\\" reputation. He really should get a Best Actor Oscar nod for his work here. Kate Winslett is superb as Clementine. In supporting roles, Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Woods and Mark Ruffalo are outstanding.  <br /> <br />I think in years to come \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" will be rememberd as both a mesmerizing love story and as a sharp commentary on relationships is the early 21st Century.   <br />
B000063JDE|5.0|The operative word on \\"Blue Velvet\\" is surreal.  I'm not going to try to analyze it but I'm just going to say I like it.  When this film was released in 1986 it came way out from leftfield.  It was a totally unexpected surprise from the director of \\"Elephant Man\\" and the collossal bomb, \\"Dune\\"(maybe it shouldn't have been so unexpected for anybody who had seen the equally bizarre \\"Eraserhead\\").  David Lynch opens the film as some Norman Rockwell American world and slowly peels off the layers of this facade to reveal the dark underbelly of this idyll.  The movie begins where fresh-faced Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) returns home from college following his father's heart attack.  He discover's a dismembered ear in a field and turns it over to the police.  Not contented with leaving the investigation to the police, Jeffrey goes on his own investigation to discover the mystery of the ear.  What he encounters is a mysterious lounge singer, Dorothy Valens(Isabella Rossellini) and Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper)a bizarre fetishist who has Dorothy under his control.  Hopper's rendering of Frank ranks as one of the great examples of screen villainy of all time.  Hopper's performance is indelible and over-the-top.  In a smaller role Dean Stockwell as Frank's sexually ambiguous friend, Ben, makes an impression with his lip-synced performance of Roy Orbison's song, \\"In Dreams\\".  This film definitely falls under the category of love-it or hate-it.  I fall under the former category because I admire Lynch for trying something so ambitious and being a singular voice in film-making.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|So many of these new bands can't seem to manage putting out a totally good album.  I can name the bands that have on one hand.  The Arcade Fire would be my pinky then.  They are a band that is totally open to everyone, without fashion constraints (and hopefully indie snob constraints too).  Either Funeral or Antics (Interpol) is the best album of the year thus far.  I like them both so I will let someone else decide.  Hopefully they sound this good in concert and continue to sound this good on their next album.  I'll be there.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Ululates the predictably vile putz that actually finds something redeeming in this derivative dross.  Okay, so maybe I'm some troglodyte who's been sequestered for too long in some dimly lit cave somewhere for the past year or so, but dare I inquire as to how one farrago of stuffy-nosed Scotts usurps and completely purloins the entire sound of one band's early era and claims it as their own and are inexplicably branded as indie wunderkinds?  Truly astonishing when you consider how pap like this congeals and clogs the consciousness of people, diluting them and diverting their attention from the source from whence it came.  I speak, of course, of XTC.  For those not in the know, Franz Ferdinand has taken on the task of duplicating the sound of Andy Partridge and his fellow compatriots in XTC, desalinating it of any preceding integrity, and pandering it to a mass audience.  Now I make no brazen claims about being the most intelligent human being to traipse about the planet, but I am absolutely befuddled as to how this continually happens with newer bands.  There's no slight resemblance, the whole damned thing sounds like XTC's drums and wires and Go2.   If you think I'm prevaricating to simply offend the people who enjoy the album, listen to the excerpts provided to you by amazon, then try vainly to defend these charlatans.  By the way, it's beyond my concern if I sound like some pedantic ass denouncing all mainstream music (for i adore the flaming lips and many other major label bands) as shallow and unoriginal, but the success and promulgation of intolerable bands like Franz Ferdinand make this hardly perdurable.  What, XTC isn't couth enough for the people who watch MTV so we must take their pop sensibilities and badly translate them into the pabulum for the ignorant masses (who would simultaneously purchase this lovely little album and the Strokes most recent effort)?  That must be the answer, but I find no solace in the fact that people can be so negligible of theantecedants.  Recent bands like the Rapture and Interpol may sport some identifiable influences from previous bands, but they supplant that influence with some redeemable aspect of their own making.  They don't hideously manufacture the emotionless, bloodless fodder of acts like Franz Ferdinand.  And in case subtlety isn't your gig, I advise you wholeheartedly to skip the badly refrigerated leftovers and go straight to XTC's early catalogue.
B0002S64OG|5.0|Of all the baby DVDs/videos out there, I'd say get this one first ... or add it to your collection.  My 10 month old definitely likes this one more than any of the others.  It calms him down instantly every time we play it, and he's happily glued to the TV the entire time.  I like this one the most too, because it's more \\"educational\\" than the others, with an excellent introduction to letters and different body parts.  Plus, the separate section for parents has information that I found very interesting.
0679720200|3.0|I found this book dull, yet honest.  Its themes were hardly evident.  The storyline is meaningless and depressing.  Mr. Meursault appears to be content with his repetitive and insignificant lifestyle, providing readers with no initiative to read on.  Although the end is surprising and morbid, it teaches us no lessons or values.  It poorly portrays its supposal themes of the injustice in the legal system, alienation, and the senselessness of every day life, as are the claimed themes.  Nothing is to be gained after reading this book.
B00005JN7O|4.0|This film reflects amazing visual invention, and first-time writer/director Kerry Conran, self-professed computer geek, has fashioned something remarkably singular from his fertile imagination, his obviously encyclopedic knowledge of pre-WWII popular culture, and most of all, his technological savvy. What he has created is impressive - a self-contained world of startling images that seem simultaneously futuristic and retro in a colorized black-and-white world bathed in diffuse lighting and stylized art deco designs. Moving like a speeding train, the plot is stuffed with so many references to other classic stories and movies it often gets overwhelming, and I have to admit some of the turns get very convoluted as a result. As a pop culture junkie myself, I see tributes to George Pal's \\"War of the Worlds\\", Ray Harryhausen's special effects in \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\", Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Lost World\\", James Hilton's \\"Lost Horizon\\", Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\", Steven Spielberg's \\"Indiana Jones\\" trilogy and \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\", George Lucas' \\"Star Wars\\" especially in the aerial chase scenes, and the stiff upper lip of British WWII films. Whew! That's a lot for a 103-minute film, but Conran does an extraordinary job of spinning his plates into a truly exciting film. Beyond that, it amazes me that most of the action was done against a blue screen, as the people and images seamlessly meld together. There are incredible sequences involving gigantic robots trampling New York, fanciful aerial air strips with dozens of fighter planes, swarms of automated winged weapons among others, and they are sequenced at a lightning-fast pace.<br /><br />The actors are well cast, though the best compliment one can pay them is that they don't get in the way of the action. In fact, their relative nonchalance to the extraordinary things going on around them is a major part of the fun. The omnipresent Jude Law, who is bordering on overexposure these days, cuts a dashing figure as the nominal hero, though he seems too lightweight and frankly a bit too earnest to be truly memorable. Ah, if Harrison Ford was only two decades younger... Gwyneth Paltrow plays the obligatory Lois Lane part, aptly named Polly Perkins, with a saucy mix of Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo allure (I love the skirt slitting shot) and Barbara Stanwyck's tough-dame savvy. Certainly this is quite a departure from the jetset vagabonds Law and Paltrow played in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\", though their patrician attractiveness does confirm how well suited they are for period movies. In an all-too-brief part late in the film, Angelina Jolie is wonderfully gutsy as a veddy British naval captain, finally able to use her striking looks (not to mention her arresting eyepatch) to great effect. Not every actress can get away with a line like \\"Alert the amphibious squad!\\". In smaller roles, Giovanni Ribisi as the bubblegum-chewing Dex and British comedian Omid Djalili as Vienna sausage-loving Kaji seem to function purely as plot devices to move the story along. Conran understandably uses characters as chess pieces because the visual elements are what make this story percolate.<br /><br />I only wish Conran could have simplified the story a bit to let us absorb more of what's going on. I felt a little out of breath every time the locale changed since I wasn't sure I grasped everything I needed to know up to that point. I also think it's a bit of a conceit to \\"cast\\" the late Laurence Olivier as the primary villain since it feeds into one of the final plot twists. By the way, a great ending line awaits. Regardless, Conran is definitely a talent to watch, and it makes me wonder what he could possibly do next. Highly recommended fun.g figure as the nominal hero, though he seems too lightweight and frankly a bit too earnest to be truly memorable. Ah, if Harrison Ford was only two decades younger...

B000127LW2|5.0|Season One sets the stage for a great series in the Star Trek realm.  Action, drama, aliens, you name it, all included in this box DVD set.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange would have to be one of my favorite books of all time.  It is an amazing story of a young boy, Alex, and his daily life as a child delinquent.  The moral of the story, to me at least, is that one must choose to be good; it cannot be forced upon them.  I recommend this book to anyone who can read it and get the gist of it.  It is filled with it's own made-up language, so that is a bit hard to get used to at first.  Read it!
B0000073PU|5.0|This British version of Bollocks has a much clearer mix than the US version!  That in itself is worth it since it's one of the greatest albums of all times.  SPUNK is '77 demos and the Chris Spedding demos sounding their best.  OK, I bought it for about 5 bucks less - if you don't want to pay full price, it's well worth searching for at a lower price; or check back here for a possible future discount.
B0000524CY|3.0|Well if you are wandering which version to buy,the \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\" is the better one. The only thing that I like about the \\"version you have never seen\\" is the \\"spider walk\\" and the evil face enhancements during Regan's psychitric appointment.Other than that I feel that the additional scenes only slows down the pace of the original film which was already a cinematic masterpiece.
B00028HBKM|4.0|First, a little perspective about the reviewer. I am not Catholic or Jewish, but a Christian and member of a mainstream denomination with an undergraduate degree in history and a professional postgraduate degree. <br />STYLE: I did not see this movie in a cinema, because I live in a small town without a decent cinema, and because I felt this subject made this film better suited to private viewing. Mel Gibson chose good actors and the film was well-filmed. However, its generally Italian cast reminded me in some ways of the Italian biblical pictures of the late 50s and 60s. I found Mel Gibson's use of the vernacular languages of the time very distracting, and an interferance to understanding a basic story that I was familiar with from my childhood. The language was such a problem that my wife and I changed to \\"English narration for the visually impaired\\", which was a woman reading the dialog in English and describing the scenes. It helped a lot. The major roles were excellent -- Jesus, Mary Magdalene, but I felt the language kept me from really understanding or identifying with them. Pilate, on the other hand, appeared to be channeling Brando in The Godfather. There was not a real attempt at providing any context for people unfamiliar with the story, which was a great lapse, and there were some significant problems. How much violence was there? It was so over the top, that it made Scarface look like Bambi. There was so much blood, and so much torture that it was impossible to believe that anyone could have lived through it to get to the cross. The film was somewhat dark, cramped, and confusing, so it was at first difficult to be sure who anyone was. Finally, there was an enigmatic resurrection scene totally devoid of emotional resonance and seemingly gratuitously grafted onto the first ending. Color and sound quality of the DVD were excellent. <br />SUBSTANCE -- I understand why some people criticized parts of this movie as anti-Semitic, and I understand why some people said it was \\"too Catholic\\". The character Satan is so enigmatic I will leave him to someone else to explain his part, and there are CGI transformations of children into demons tormenting Judas. I will have to say that Mel Gibson imagined/created one of the most wondrous scenes I have ever seen, that for me summarized the whole dramatic impact of the subject. At the end of the crucifiction, after Jesus surrenders his spirit and dies, an overhead shot pans back and back, receding obviously into the sky. At the sky level, the scene undergoes a CGI transform into a drop of clear liquid, a tear from God, which when it hits the ground triggers the earthquake. As awesome as this was, the resurrection (final scene) was a brief, minimalist anti-climax that was incredibly disappointing to me, and clearly an afterthought. The burial linens suddenly deflate, and an enigmatic (and tastefully nude) Jesus walks out into the light of day.
B0000024W3|5.0|When this album first came out, the Kent State killings had just happened.  I was a college student at the time, and the prevailing mood among us all was to *lay low*.  This album seemed as prophetic & timely as any other Dylan album.  It provided the perfect soundtrack to a summertime of art students trying to come up with a way forward, a better dream.  Of course, the hyped-up, competative crowd, embarrassed to even think about kicking back, dissed the album.  Regardless of how high-powered you might be, though, the easy camaraderie of this music remains good medicine.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars episodes 4, 5 and 6 are three of my favorite movies, well really Episode 4 a new hope is one of my favorites of all time, and the other two complete the set. The empire strikes back is very good but not a classic like a New Hope, it is action packed from beginning to end, and Return of the Jedi is a little too hoakey and to much for the 3-12 audience, with the ewoks and all. Nevertheless all three movies are fun and its great to get them on DVD (after all this time) in pristine condition. They look and sound great. There is also an extra disk of extra's, for those who like those things. I personally do not care about the extras, I do not have the time to waste on that kind of thing; But I know there are people out there who will judge the DVD's on the extras alone. Well, to each there own. This set is worth it to have a New Hope on DVD alone.
B00006L3S3|5.0|This song ALONE is worth the cost of this CD. Why was this song not a worldwide SMASH????  It is one of the most beautiful songs ever written by anybody.  The rest of the album is great, but if nothing else listen to \\"You Are Here\\" and tell everyone you know to do the same.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore does a great job of educating the American people about the corruption that is going on in this country from this administration.  <br /> <br />The film itself is very well done, like it or hate it. <br /> <br />I'm sure as these Presidential debates continue and people start questioning the legitamacy of the Haliburton corportion and all of it's uncontentested contracts it has received from the Bush administration the more attention this film will receive. <br /> <br />Like a previous review has explained, people who hate this film are right-wing nuts who chant \\"lies\\", but don't ever specifically point out any in the film. <br /> <br />If you truly love your country you will view this film and research the various contraversial topics in it, such as the Haliburton corporation, what the administration knew before invading Iraq, Bush's instructions to the FBI (Give me a reason to invade!), and his connection/business relationship to various islamic countries. <br /> <br />You may come to the conclusion that Bush has more of an interest pleasing his business partners than the American people.
B000000OAH|5.0|\\"Jealousy\\" is one of Freddie's most beautiful and heart wrenching ballads ever.  The way those soaring harmonies sing \\"if only you could see just what you do to me..oh jealousy\\" make it hard for me to phathom why this song wasn't a worldwide smash hit single. The other is John Deacon's hauntingly gorgeous \\"In Only Seven Days\\". Freddie pours his heart out into the vocals of this upbeat love song. Most people think of this as \\"oh yeah, the album with fat bottom girls and bicycle race on it\\", but the two songs i've talked about are far better than either of these two more well known songs. The other big hit off this album \\"Don't stop me now\\" was deservedly so; it is just plain great.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I find it interesting that so many of the professional reviews that I've read claim this movie to be \\"funny.\\"  I think they confuse \\"funny\\" with avante garde, or even quirky (and it's likely that the more conservative of them couldn't understand either anyway).  Overall, I thought the movie was so sad - the idea of being trapped in a situation where your precious memories are being erased, and there is nothing you can do about it, is simply heartbreaking to watch.  The movie, which maps out a reverse transgression of what appeared to be a great relationship (meeting, dating, comfort-zone, annoyance and insecurity, then breakup) is something that anyone who's had a great girl/guy and let him/her go can relate to.  The script and the direction really drive it home, to the point where I felt that I was slowly losing this relationship as well.  As many other reviewers might agree, it's worth more than one viewing.  While the movie isn't \\"David Lynch\\" abstract, it was still quite a pleasure to see it a second time and say, \\"Ohhh...so that's what they meant at the end of the movie.\\"  You'll see.  Overall, a must see...a must OWN.  Congratulations to Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet on this.  Both actors break out of their typical roles in this movie (\\"goofball\\" and \\"pseudo-debutante\\", that is).  Definitely - see this one.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|There is not a whole lot I can add when an item has 200 plus reviews. <br />If you watch the films for what they are, most people will like them, and especially the new editions for Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection. <br />As noted, this collection is packed full of extras, and I thoroughly enjoyed the interviews, especially for Alien 3, and resurrection. <br /> <br />The Studio interference in Alien 3 is very evident, and the original cut is way better than the theatrical mess. <br />David Fincher had a major problem as director, and that problem was the bean counters at the Studio. <br /> <br />ALIEN is evidence of just what a visionary directory can achieve when given free reign, just as ALIENS is evidence of how a good director can make a film work WELL. <br /> <br />Alien Resurrection is excellent evidence of how a film can be rescued. Juenet has allegedly  said that he did not know why people went to the studio to be scared, well, his version of the film is trash compared to the 2003 cut. <br /> <br />Sadly, this franchise was messed by the studio and showed how \\"too many cooks spoil the broth\\". <br /> <br />Most importantly, the collection as it is here, shows that the story line is far from fished out, and I feel that an Alien 5 directed and maybe even co-written by Weaver, would be superb. <br /> <br />This collection is worth every penny, and then some.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Ok, here's my .02.  In short, it's awesome!  Using the 5.1 surround, the audio was completely excellent!  No `jitters' in the video, everything was smooth and it just sucked me in.  Sorry others didn't seem to enjoy it, or at least not as much... oh well, their loss.  It's Star Wars, it's on DVD, and in a set like this, well I just can't find anything to not like.  :-)  Well except eventually getting a widescreen TV to maximize the viewing.  ;-)  That's coming within the next year.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Finally on DVD...but... <br /> <br />I won't go into lengthy detail on the changes; since there are plenty reviews here that have already done the job for me. <br /> <br />The digital \\"enhancements\\" stick out like a sore thumb of course, but other things bothered me as well. Star Wars was originally a feat of innovation, and relying on cgi effects is far from the brilliance Lucas and co. were once forced to conjure.  <br /> <br />I pay close attention to sound, and I noticed that sometimes the voice overdubs, mainly on Lea's, will sound crystal clear, and some of the other characters have that muffled, 70's film quality, which I don't mind a bit. I just say do them all over or don't do them at all.  <br /> <br />Also, pay close attention to the Millennium Falcon vs. Ti-Fighters and you can see flaws around some of the Ti-Fighters as they fly around Han and Luke. <br /> <br />It's a DVD for chrissake! I'm sure Lucas could have fit the original version in there along with the ruined version! <br />
B00028HBKM|2.0|While this is a powerful movie and very dramatically acted, I think it misses the major point of Jesus on the cross.  The director seems so obsessed with portraying physical pain and suffering inflicted by humans (which he does gruesomely well) that he fails to show Jesus's major reason for suffering. <br /> <br />It was Jesus's brief seperation from God the Father on the cross that was far more terrible than any physical suffering.  This was his sacrifice so we can be forgiven for our sins.  After spending all eternity in loving company together, that period when God cut him off emotionally was pure hell.  The same hell that we put ourselves through in life when we isolate ourselves from God's love. <br /> <br />I appreciate the effort of Gibson, but I think the film falls fall short.
B0002234LS|5.0|Yeah, I'm a product of that time period when people caught in a claustrophobic set freaked out and reacted. \\"Secret Window\\" is always fun, Depp is wonderful, Koepp works well with the script & direction. John Turturro, most underrated, is excellent; strong and determined. Johnny Depp never fails to entertain me. This may not be his best film, but certainly a new addition to his many personalities. There are good extras on the DVD, mostly of Koepp banging his own drum. (I liked \\"Stir of Echoes\\"...) I want to take issue that a previous reviewer said this was among the best adaptations of Stephen King. I think that Frank Darabont's adaptations of \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\" were far superior. On the tension level, though, this works for me. (I liked Rob Reiner's \\"Misery\\", too.) I'd like to have Mr. Koepp make a coherent version of a Dean Koontz book..it hasn't happened yet. Koepp could do it.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I have watched almost every single episode of \\"the gilmore girls\\".  And I have to say that it is one of the smartest and most pleasant show to watch.  The dialogues are sharp and the characters will keep you coming back for more.  I am not going to write a lengthy praise but to say that you won't regret watching this show.
078401213X|1.0|Pretentious nonsense with an ALMOST interesting idea at the core, but all the silly \\"I'm so indie, I shake my camera like a polaroid\\" filmmaking is so overdone that it brings any interest you might have in the tiny idea this story has down to its poor knees. I actually felt sorry for the story. It deserved better, but it was abused and molested by an amateur filmmaker pretending he had SKILLS by making it grainy and black & white and cheap and...well, super shaky. All of the \\"look at me, I'm trying to be a genius here\\" silliness made me shake my head in embarrassment for the director of this mess. Not that I can entirely blame him for trying. There truly is a sucker born every minute, and many of those suckers actually fell into this guy's sticky pretentious web. Ugh!
B000002MM8|5.0|This is an excellent CD. I have been listening it during years... <br />absolute must have
B000002JEV|5.0|Disc one features fourteen tracks that were recorded and played on various dates through out 1969. I found something good about all three versions of &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;. It holds one's interest because each version sounds a bit different. There are two cuts here that either I've never heard or I just plain don't remember, &quot;The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair&quot; and &quot;Something Else&quot;. Anyone remember the show 'Top Gear'? There are several tunes here from that gig, like &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby&quot;, &quot;Dazed And Confused&quot; and the always fun to hear &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot;. Disc two is of a live concert that was recorded at the Paris Theater in London on April 1, 1971. Starts off with the hard rock staple &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; then goes on with &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, &quot;Black Dog&quot;, the ever beautiful sounding &quot;Going To California&quot; and six others. What caught me by complete surprise was their medley of &quot;Boogie Chillun' /Fixin' To Die / A Mess Of Blues&quot;. This set was mastered and assembled by Jimmy Page himself, so you KNOW the quality  will be nothing short of superb. A must have for all Zeppelin fans.
B00003CXCT|1.0|there is much discussion over star wars but it all boils down to this: <br />these films are from over 20 years ago. <br />2 decades and we're still caught up in this nonsense. <br />how's about all the upset star wars fans use their beloved childhood memories of the originals as inspiration to do something fantastic with their own lives. <br />let's out-do george lucas. <br />let's try to make something new that will be as enduring as the star wars films, if not more. there should be films coming out every summer that are way better than star wars ever was.  <br />less talk more action.  <br />save your $50 and use it help finance your own sci-fi opus. <br />lucas is a virgin and obsolete. <br />peace <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I dont care if your not a Green Day fan. I wasnt really a Green Day fan, but was inspired to buy American Idiot cos of the single which i couldnt get enough of. I therefore had low expectations of the rest of the album, but god was i wrong! I'd say that most of the songs on the album are better than American Idiot, with a range of different melodies, with more emotional songs such as 'whatsername' and 'boulevard of broken dreams', and more punk type songs such as 'She's a rebel' and one of my favourites 'Jesus of Suburbia'. This album offers everything. There are no bad songs on the album, although there are a couple that sound a bit blink-182ish, but only a bit. And the coolest thing is the fact that tracks 2 and 12 have 5 parts to them! How cool! Try and buy the limited box edition if you can, cos one of my mates bought that and she says its so much better than they regular version (which i lent to her).  <br /> <br />Overall, a quality, quality album. The best album of the year by miles, maybe even the best of the new millenium! <br />Hope my review helped!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I love this album soooo much! It almost never leaves my car unless i must have it on my stereo. It also comes to work with me. I'm sure others have sung its praises here already so I'll just keep it short: you will not be disappointed. It stands to repeated listenings. I missed a Franz concert back in June and I'm still kicking myself for it. 5 BIG stars!
B00003CXCT|4.0|I love the bonus material that is included with the DVD, but there are moments when they show a scene from the movie that I have never seen before (and after buying the triolgy 5 times plus 3 making of docs, and the holiday special, I have seen it all)  So there are many filmed scenes that fans have never been released.  So does that mean that Lucas will never release these clips or is he going to release yet another version (maybe after the release of Ep. III) and force us to buy it again.  I do love the new changes (I haven't watched \\"Jedi\\" yet, so no comment on Hayden). <br />Just including some deleted scenes or outtakes would have earned this 5 stars, but the search for perfection continues.
B0002VEXUA|5.0|This is a must for all Oasis fans -- not just for the music but for the interviews and laughs.  Liam, being Liam, saying that he didn't think much of the record anyway. Mani taliking about getting notes out an anaconda while flying on acid, and Noel describing a night at the Luxor in Vegas. Ace...buy it, you won't regret it....besides, your original copy of the record should be worn out by now.
0743454529|5.0|This book was selected by one of my book club members, who told us we HAD to read this one.  When she gave us a brief description, we all had the same reaction - how depressing, I don't want to read this!  But, moaning and groaning, we all did.  And we all loved this book!  We had a tremendous discussion about families and how they \\"function\\", about how the members interact and know what buttons to push to inflict maximum aggravation yet rally with unequivocal support when it counts.  Although only one child is ill, the book shows how the whole family is impacted, and fights back together. <br /> <br />I began the book eager to hate the parents.  And ended up thinking \\"There but for the grace of God go I.\\"  And the brother...it's been quite a while since a book has made me want to yell out loud about an oncoming \\"train wreck\\".  And yet, in spite of the serious subject there are several scenes that are funny and touching.  I highly recommend this book - even the characters who are not members of this family have their own family stories to tell. <br /> <br />Read it, then pass it along.  Others may take it reluctantly, but they'll thank you when they're done.
0780020685|5.0|Plenty has been written on the quality of Kurosawa's filmmaking, in general and for this film in particular. I will content to say that  \\"Seven Samurai\\" unfolds slowly and beautifully to its superb climax and bittersweet conclusion. Kurosawa alone gets five stars, and more if it were possible. <br /> <br />As for the quality of Criterion's digital transfer: it's fine for most of the film, but the picture becomes very scratchy and faded for several minutes towards the end, particularly in one of the more quiet and reflective moments. That aside, though, this is a great buy and well worth your time to watch.
0553382179|5.0|If I could give FlyLady and Marla Cilley 10 stars, I would. <br /> <br />Unlike a few Negative Nellie reviewers, I wasn't born organized (BO to us FlyBabies).   For anyone who is always organized or already does their cleaning automatically--why did they buy this book?  This book is for people who can't seem to do it on their own, for whatever reason.   <br /> <br />I have recently been diagnosed with Adult ADD.  It wasn't a problem until I had kids.  I'd just do massive cleaning sessions doing my whole house in one night on Saturday night or whenever the mood struck me... right down to scrubbing the bathroom till I could see my reflection in the shower stall.   <br /> <br />What FlyLady's routines have done for me is give me a system to break down those marathons and remember to do little bits at a time.  I'm not lazy or messy on purpose, I simply lacked the proper focus and organization. I was a binge and purge cleaner, and it's no surprise that's how the rest of my life was too. <br /> <br />Contrary to some other reviews I've read, it's not about being \\"clean clean clean\\" all the time. It's about getting yourself to the point where you spend very little conscious effort cleaning.  FlyLady doesn't WANT us to spend all Saturday dusting everything in the house like our mothers (or in my case, sister) did.  We clean little bits here and there so the dust isn't there to begin with.  We \\"vacuum the middles\\" and don't get down and along the baseboards every time.  That's because our little bits here and there keep the dirt from ever creeping to the baseboards. <br /> <br />And if that's how clean your house is all the time, don't buy this book.   You don't need it.  But if you find yourself shoving things out of sight and frantically begging for an extra 5 minutes every time a last-minute visitor is set to arrive, you need Sink Reflections and FlyLady.
B00005JN7O|3.0|Press releases for this movie described the special effects in great detail, even boasting of the fact that there is not one set in the whole production.  It was all done with smoke and mirrors -- I mean CGI.  That is both this movie's strength and weakness. <br /> <br />It looks very pretty.  The colors are muted, there are almost no sharp edges.  The story is vintage 30s from the girl reporter to the flying ace.  And like the 30s, its the girl who causes as much havoc as the good she does.  The most modern element is the history between the two of them.  Their love-hate relationship, although a cliche, is appropriate here, and well acted by Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow.  However, it is the character of Dex, Sky Captain's sidekick, who steals the show, in his short time on screen. <br /> <br />One of the biggest flaws in this movie is a lack of soul.  The beauty is only skin deep, so to speak.  When his whole base is wiped out, every soul killed, every bit of machinery, every building devastated, Sky Captain has no reaction.  His only concern is for the information that Dex had gleaned from the last transmissions of the enemy.  Even in their relationship, he and Polly seem to only get satisfaction from getting the better of each other. <br /> <br />For a better adventure and love story, one might be better off renting or buying the Indiana Jones series or even The Rocketeer.  In newer films, Fade to Black is better conceived.
B00008EY65|5.0|Hellboy, when it was first announced as a film project, shocked me because I kept trying to figure out how it was going to be made.  First I pondered the budget necessary to make a film version of Mike Migola's insanely cool comic without making it look stupid and cheap.  Second I worried greatly about the director.  Last, I couldn't even begin to think about who the hell would play Hellboy.<br /><br />Amazing as it seems, the budget was more than adequate, the director more than capable (Guillermo del Toro), and the actor playing Hellboy (Ron Perlman) was, is, and always will be the film incarnation of the big red guy.  In fact, if I had my way I'd nominate Perlman for an Academy Award (and in doing so validate those frivolities very existence).  Betcha it don't happen though.<br /><br />This film is the grandest presentation of a fanboy project since The Fellowship of the Ring, made all the more amazing by the fact that the source material is a borderline underground comic.  Del Toro's genius is in proving that great film making can come from the semi-obscure.<br /><br />Every shot with Hellboy is eyecatching, and with the special effects teams involved it's no wonder.  From creature animation, to backgrounds the best of the best had there hand in this film.<br /><br />While Hellboy is bad ass, Abe Sapien is perhaps one of the most beautiful creature creations brought to film ever, kind of like the Creature from the Black Lagoon with a yen for book learning instead of white bikinis.  Liz, is a Firestarter that would roast Drew Barrymore like some leftover cocktail weenie.<br /><br />Throw in a tick tock man made of gears and cogs who was a nazi super assassin, the mad monk Rasputin, and several demon/gods from hell and you've got an action/horror hybrid that's enough to put any SFX junkie into joy riddled convulsions.<br /><br />The best part about this movie (aside from the reported sequel in the works) is that it increased the world's knowledge exponentially of the wonderful comic by Mike Mignola.  People are now seeking out the haunting artwork and surreal storytelling of Hellboy and I envy anyone their first glance into Mignola's imagination.<br /><br />Now for one last thing, apparently a director's cut is on the way, and while on the one hand I feel cheated, I also find myself curious.

B000088E6D|5.0|Imagine a singer who actually sounds better than he or she looks.   <br /> <br />Buble plays an old Sinatra trick and sings and takes ownership of some oldies.  This album contains the \\"Moondance Song\\" which is likely his best song ever.  He also confidently adds new spice to \\"Fever\\" which is a song I used to play in high school band.  Who would think it could be so well resurrected?
B00005LC1H|5.0|Truly funny sitcom. Frankly, though I like some of Cleese's later portrayals, Basil Fawlty is his best work ever. Clever in the idea, the ensemble, the writing, Fawlty Towers is hilarious. It should have gone on for several seasons. If you like Frasier for the multi-layered and higher level humor that exceeds the sophomoric in some of the current television shows, then you'll like this wacky hotel. I'm not sure in today's politically correct world that this sitcom could even be made, which makes it possibly more valuable.
B0000DD7UC|5.0|P!nk last relase is one of her best. I really enjoyed the whole cd but it seems short to me. I think she did herself justice with this cd. My favorite is Save My Life it is so pretty and just about anyone can relate to it. Walk Away is another on of my favorite because if you are with someone you know what she is talking about. But the one that over does save my life and walk away is Last to know. This song reminds me of Madonna Like A Prayer at the begaining before the beat comes in. She did a great job and I hope she keep up the good job.
B00005JNEI|5.0|F911 is full of media clips and photos of the president himself. F911 is for the undecided crowd period. Its not going to change any Republicans views, nothing really will. I doubt any of them have seen the documentary yet will still give it a poor review here on Amazon. If you are undecided then this documentary is for you. Moore uses actual video and pictures of George Bush to prove his various points. If does not get any better then this. When you can prove a point by showing George Bush actually saying it with his own words, then it paints a clear picture of his intent. If you have doubts about GWB, especially after the first debate, then this documentary is for you... See what Bush has to say in his own words...
1591840562|5.0|Guy Kawasaki's book \\"The Art of the Start\\" takes a focused and practical approach to starting your own business. <br /> <br />\\"The Art of the Start\\" is a quick read with lots of valuable tips on the sometimes counter-intuitive process of getting your idea off the ground. Guy touches on a number of topics including raising capital, writing a business plan (a sane method, not the usual \\"explain exactly how much you will spend on staples over the course of five years\\" process I have seen in so many other books) and how to make your often complex idea fit into one or two concise sentences. <br /> <br />I was happy to see examples from Guy's past listed often throughout the book, in both \\"to-do\\" and \\"not-to-do\\" varieties. <br /> <br />I think that anyone who is starting their own business will be delighted to see what they are doing right, and suprised at some of the things they are getting wrong. <br /> <br />This book was both uplifting and humbling as I head into my second venture. Highly recommended.
B0002KQNL8|5.0|I dont see how you guys can completely critisize this dvd without even seeing it yet big deal so Warner Bros. couldnt get the rights to the songs big shocker (NOT)at least they got the commentary I give the movie 2 thumbs up!!
B00005JNEI|1.0|Let's face it, Moore's only reason for making this film was to get Bush voted out of office.  So much for artistic credibility and nonbias.<br /><br />If you're willing to subject yourself to BOTH sides of the story you should watch \\"Farenhype 9/11 as well. You can find it at overstock.com  I have little hope that Moore's fans will do this since all they want is to unseat President Bush.  If they were concerned about the truth they wouldn't bother with Michael Moore, who has NEVER let the truth bother him.
0062502182|4.0|I believe the book is about following your dream and never giving up.It talks about the challenges you face and what sacrifices need to be made... its about never letting go of that one thing that inspires you and following it to the end.
B000002MT0|1.0|Prince has made some fabulous music the past 25 years or so. But this album, Come, is his weakest one.  The songs are bad, Letitgo was the only good song here, and the funk is seriously lacking here.  It was one of his last albums for Warner Bros. Records, but I can tell that his relationship with them went sour. They were supportive during his Purple Rain era, but later disintegrated long after that.  Fortunately, Musicology is selling like crazy now, which makes this 1994 album completely forgettable. Save your money and get his latest one, Purple Rain or 1999 instead.  Even Prince could say himself that this album sucked!

The amount of energy and metal grace this band brings to its listeners is enough to change your whole concept of rock music.

B00028HBL6|5.0|No matter how many of you online here write or give bad reviews re: the movie \\"The Passion Of The Christ\\", it is indeed quite evident that this movie has & is still deeply touching millions upon millions of lives!  Actor Mel Gibson did not go forward with a movie with such a [according to this world] controversial movie just to get a hunk of money in his pocket/bank account.....it is clear that none of us really like to be bothered with that kind of attention or controversy, so with that said, you dont have to be a christian to know & realize there was something bigger going on with this movie production!  Nothing in this movie or about this movie was non-biblical, EVERYTHING depicted in this *beautiful* & *realistic* movie was straight from the bible.  In response to one of the reviewers of this movie, yes the bible does speak of satan or the anti-christ as being handsome or nice looking [in today's terms], which is exactly why Mel Gibson chose a slender, soft-faced female to play the role of satan ------ she [the actress] is very easy on the eyes but extremely beyond spooky at the same exact time....the actress that plays satan is still easy on the eyes even though she's hooded in this film! <br /> <br /> <br />I think that Noone will be the same after seeing this remarkable film....not even the nay-sayers & athiests who've put even more money into this film project by going to the movies to see it, only to complain about it!   ----I thank you, Mel thanks you & I'm sure Our Heavenly Father thanks you for being soooooo supportive inspite of your disbelief!!!   -----May God Bless You & have mercy on your life [that He created]! <br />------To You reading this, .....if you havent by any chance actually seen this movie & are afraid to are somehow paying attention to some of these less than intelligent reviews, Go See The Movie For Yourself!  ....This movie is God's work ...not Mel's! <br /> <br />      <br />
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I normally don't review things that aren't out yet, but this looks to be one of the best DVD sets ever. I think that these flicks are fairly unappreciated in their own time and will be regarded much better by future generations.  <br /> <br />Also, John Hancock, anyone that calls Blade Runner \\"terrible\\" needs not be listened to. Just ignored. You completely invalidated your opinion with that statement. Bravo.
0465043550|2.0|The author renders a brilliant critique of modern finance theory.  He criticizes all its components, including CAPM, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and the Black Scholes model as being flawed.  All these theories rely on two main assumptions.  The first one is that market prices are normally distributed.  The author, using price charts, demonstrates that market prices do not follow a normal distribution; but instead a Cauchy distribution.  Such a distribution is associated with fatter tails.  This means that catastrophic drop in market prices happen more frequently than a normal distribution suggests.  The second assumption of modern finance is that market prices are independent of each other.  Yesterday's prices have no influence on today's.  The author makes a case that even if prices are not correlated, their volatility is correlated over time.  Thus, big price swings tend to cluster.  If a stock moved by 10% yesterday, it is likely it will move by an above average amount today even if we don't know the direction of that change.  He calls this correlation of volatility (instead of price) long-term dependence.<br /><br />Because the two main assumptions of modern finance are flawed, all related models are flawed as they understate risk.  If such models understate risk, they actually overprice stocks and underprice options, and also understate the capital financial institutions should hold to withstand market risk.<br /><br />If the author had stopped there, I would have given him a 5 rating.  However, such a rebuttal of finance theory would make no more than a great essay.  Instead, he attempts to build an entirely different edifice of modern finance over 300 pages.  And, his theoretical foundation lacks any robustness.  That's why I call it a castle of cards.<br /><br />Mandelbrot builds his edifice of modern finance on two new parameters that would replace the mean return and volatility of return or standard deviation (mean and standard deviation being the parameters defining a normal distribution).  His first parameter is Alpha, derived from Pareto's Law, is an exponent that measures how wildly prices vary.  It defines how fat the tails of the price change curve are.  The second one, the H Coefficient, borrowed from a hydrologist named Hurst, is an exponent that measures the dependence of price changes upon past changes.<br /><br />Well, what is wrong with these two measures?  He confesses at the end of the book that no two individuals calculate the same Alpha and H Coefficient when using the exact same historical data!  Apparently, there is no one established way to calculate these two parameters.  The divergence between the various methodologies can be huge.  Using one method, you could derive Alpha and H coefficients that suggest a stock is not risky, using another method you would reach the opposite conclusion.  So, after reading nearly 300 pages of intense theories you get that their own foundations are at this stage nonexistent.  If Alpha and H are mathematically not replicable and well defined, you can't apply his multifractal geometry model in any meaningful way.<br /><br />It will be up to someone else to build upon Mandelbrot's work and render it applicable to investment management by firming up the algorithms to calculate Alpha and the H Coefficient.  Only then, will fractal geometry maybe turn out into a feasible challenge to the foundation of Modern Finance.  But, at this stage contrary to what Mandelbrot pretends, it is not.<br /><br />If you are interested in investment and finance theory, I strongly recommend other books such as: Robert Shiller's \\"Irrational Exuberance\\" and \\"Market Volatility.\\"  Also, Nicholas Taleb's \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" is very good.  Also, Roger Lowenstein's \\"When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long Term Capital Management.\\"  This last book is a fascinating account of why a hedge fund failed because it relied excessively on the normal distribution, and used time series that were way too short when building its pricing models.d used time series that were way too short when building its pricing models.         <br />
B00005JMAH|1.0|My children beg me to read each night to them from the five Harry Potter books. From 11 to 5 they sit quietly entranced by her magic. When the first movie came out they wanted to see it twice or more...so we quickly bought it. After the second movie my children again awaited the dvd like christmas come early. We again began reading through all five books! <br />The first movies actually drew us raptly back into the novels. This caused my first boy, hampered by dislexia, to drive through his challenge and *NOW HE READS well on his OWN*!!! What a triumph. <br />And so we stood in long lines to see the third and favored book brought to life. Perhaps after watching it we will start a third trip reading through ... but no. <br /> <br />My children have no interest in this film and *worse* they have no interest in continuing the Harry Potter series!!! My son who over came dislexia and wears glasses has kept his hair \\"just like Harry Potter\\" for years...now he is looking for a new best book in \\"Dragon and Theif\\". His brother has left HP for HotWheels movie and his sister has left Hermine for Barbie movies. <br />Not only were my children quite frightened by this new film take, but they felt lost. It was as if they were watching a stand-alone film; and not one to their liking. <br /> <br />Added scenes and eye-candy were a waste of time and *inaccurate*. JKR was very careful in explaining that a werewolf looks just like a regular wolf, but with a slightly longer nose; they are very difficult to tell apart. His creature didn't even look canine...it didn't even have hair. <br /> <br />It was a very successful Horror film. It fits well into the horror flicks of the day. Is this what your children want? <br /> <br />Again, my children don't want us to buy this film. It hurts to leave a gap in our HP collection but this film does not belong in the collection. It is a film that stands on its own for those who like his cinematics and art. It deserves not the name of its title.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|On Air, as he explained outside The Paramount in Seattle an hour after the show ended, was to be a millenium-themed piece, but \\"Brother up in Heaven\\" pulled him back and saved the album. Still, he has not anchored the writing since before On Air, and now he is back, trying new things (including revisiting old pieces and one Parsons/Wolfson tune that didn't make it onto Eye in the Sky) <br /> <br />A Valid Path is a distinctive, albeit different, album in the Parsonian canon. If all you want is more of the same Parsons you knew from past decades, I'm afraid you won't find it here, but if you would like to see Alan reaching for some new ways of expressing himself--influences we are sure to see Parsonalized, if you will, and imporved on future albums--then pick up a copy of A Valid Path. <br /> <br />I have read more than a couple reviews saying that this album grows on the listener. I have to say that is my experience. The first time through was jarring, even difficult, but each successive one is leaving a deeper and more positive impression on me. <br /> <br />I have no regrets.
0060930349|5.0|Paul Johnson seems to turn out one vast doorstop of a book after another, and few subjects in Western history escape his curiosity. This work is a warm, rich, easy-reading narrative of the United States from the early settlers to the present day. It is no secret that Johnson - like many British writers - is a religious man, and his faith makes him particularly insightful at describing the religiosity that is such a vital part of the American foundation. Johnson's interest in art and culture and his gift for the telling anecdote make this a book that should be read, not simply referred to.
0380778556|5.0|I fell in love with this story when I accidentally caught the old movie version on tv one night.  I bought the book and fell in love with the story all over again.<br /><br />Ms Du Maurier created some wonderfully vivid characters.  The coldly distant Maxim, the lurking Mrs. Danvers, the timid Mrs. DeWinter (I LOVE that we never know her first name), and the ethereral Rebecca who starts off as a tragic figure and then....well read the book.<br /><br />The description of the house and the grounds and the boathouse were incredible.  I felt like I was walking the same corridors as Mrs DeWinter.  Felt her apprehension as she realized she could never live up to Rebecca and I will always get a chill when I think of Mrs. Danvers.  She is right up there with Hannibal Lector in terms of creepiness, in my opinion.<br /><br />Rebecca is a great piece of literary fiction.  So creepy, so chilling, so incredibly brilliant.
0140072187|5.0|Robert Mason was a reluctant warrior who flew more than one thousand combat missions as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam.  Because of the mixture of fear and bravado that made up his character, he named his book \\"Chickenhawk.\\"  It is one of the finest personal narratives from the war in Indochina.  Mason's book is simply a searing, but beautifully written recollection of one veteran's experiences - exciting, tragic, humorous, pathetic and ironic.  Starting with pilot's training in Texas, Mason takes readers on an irreverent journey aboard the helicopter, which was a ubiquitous presence in Vietnam.  Used for transporting troops into areas of almost impenetrable triple-canopy jungle where vehicles could not take them, these landing zones know as \\"LZ's\\" were often \\"hot\\" meaning that the choppers, so easily brought down by the enemies small arms, were under fire.  Then, when soldiers were wounded or killed, the choppers had to come back in to pick them up.  The bravery of the pilots and crewmen was legendary and because they were the thick of it - essentially flying to the action every day - they suffered grievous losses. Mason's readers will understand the kinship of men joined together in a small group under the most difficult of conditions.  The author was a young man who wanted to fly and so he ended up in the Army flying in \\"the helicopter war.\\"  His experiences in Vietnam, the heroism and loss that he was witness to, shaped his thinking and made him angry and bitter over what he felt was a poorly run effort and a unnecessary loss of life.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I wonder how Nightwish has managed to make 5 wonderful but still very different albums. I have been listening to them for years now, and it's strange that they are not more famous in USA or GB. They have sold platinum in Germany, anyway, and are very popular in Europe.  <br /> <br />Tarja doesn't use her voice as operatically as she did on three first albums, but you can hear that her voice gets always better and better...It's a gift from heaven! <br /> <br />\\"Once\\" is very bombastic symphonic metal with London Symphony Orcestra. This is not an easy album, you have to concentrate on it. I call this the best album of Nightwish, even though the lyrics are not as touching as they were on previous album, Century Child. Mostly because Tuomas, composer, was depressed then and now everything is going fine in his life. <br /> <br />There are very heavy tracks, like Dead Gardens, Dark Chest of Wonders, Romanticide and Planet Hell. The most bombastic songs are Creek Mary's Blood and the fantastic undescribable Ghost Love Score. Nemo, Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan (Death Makes an Artist) and Higher Than Hope are very beautiful.  <br /> <br />This album deserves to be bought!
0195067142|5.0|This is one of the finest narratives of modern combat ever written. The author was a young southerner who enlisted in the Marine Corps in the months following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. Sledge was sent to the South Pacific, where the United States was taking back a seemingly endless chain of tiny coral atolls. The implacable enemy - who almost never surrendered - was dug in deep and had to be rooted out through air, naval and artillery bombardment, small-arms fire and even hand-to-hand combat. The islands were hot and humid and the conditions the marines lived under unfathomable. Through courage, grit and dogged determination, the marines prevailed, but none of them were left unscathed. Sledge, who went on to the quiet life of a biology professor, writes of the Pacific War from the point of view of the infantryman, eye-deep in the blood, muck, mire, courage and comradeship of combat.

0385504209|1.0|This is enticing hoax, shown to be that in many books by much better researchers and historians than this author. I recommend you see and read my review in \\"Da Vinci Code: Fact or Fiction?\\" by Maier and Hannagraf.<br /><br />There you will find that from the outset Brown deceives by assuming as \\"fact\\" something that is fiction and has been proven to be so: that of the Priority of Sion.<br /><br />As well, he is deceptive on Constantine as well as the voting at the Council of Nicea.  The noted review above spells all that out.<br /><br />As polarized as our culture is it is easy to see how some on both sides seek to distort and standarize the falsification and misleading of people honestly seeking the truth on such issues as Christ, evolution, etc.  To make fiction fact, and the opposite is becoming too characteristic of our culture.  Many will unfortunately read this fiction of a book and assume it disproves the claims of Christianity easily and decisively.<br /><br />For this the author has made a serious mistake.  Although his plot is intriguing, it is seriously flawed from the outset and he makes no such claim that it is fantasy and fraud.  Unless he has other proof for which he has not provided.<br /><br />Smacks of the problem with the culture elites such as CBS News and Dan Rather.  Our country deserves better than this.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Although I annually listen to hundreds of albums in my capacity as music director at my University's radio station, I can safely say that this album is the most bracing, rich and rewarding album of the year. Certainly, it is not a superficially original album-the influences that range from the Who's mini-rock opera \\"A Quick One...\\", general power pop, punk and pure pop are immediately recognisable. However, Armstrong and company have created an immediately endearing and--surprisingly enough-transcendent work that functions and succeeds on so many levels.  <br /> <br />I suspect that those who have matured with this band, and have witnessed the seeming intra-personal, political and intellectual collapse of this nation in the decade since \\"Dookie\\"-will find this album to be particularly affecting.  (Particularly those of us, such as the reviewer, who have reached a point of their life at which past dreams and illusions are beginning to be elided by the pressing concerns of an exhausting and enervating, if lucrative, professional existence that will come into existence after graduation.) <br /> <br />I must note, however, that this album has been unfortunately vilified by a variety of groups.  <br /> <br />Elitist indie-hipsters, who find impossible the prospect of enjoying an album that is not only released on a major label but also is commercially success, castigate the band as trite, mainstream and unoriginal. <br /> <br />Frozen-in-time `punks' castigate the album for not being 'punk' enough (as if a standard, universal definition of punk exists!) <br /> <br />Those with extraordinarily limited capabilities for analytical thought castigate the band for being anti-american or some other nonsense.  <br /> <br />However, what these groups fail to realise is that: <br /> <br />(a) this is a work of personal art that rivals any other musical art released this year by ostensibly more trendy and legitimate artists;  <br />(b) that the band only uses the nation's current militarism, paranoia and \\"red-neck\\" conservatism for providing the context for a highly individualized narrative that resonates beyond mere politics and imperialism;  <br />(c) and most importantly, Green Day are no longer a simple punk band. Their transformation began with the occasionally awkward \\"Nimrod,\\" continued with the heavily Kinks-influenced \\"Warning\\" and has reached its temporary apotheosis with \\"American Idiot.\\" Although the band use punk dynamics occasionally, this dynamic is used in a broad context of guitar based pop.  Would one consider Godspeed You Black Emperor, Explosions in the Sky or Mono heavy guitar bans simply b/c they use hevay guitar dynamics within their epic compositions? Like many `punk' bands, Green Day are a pop band at heart, but unlike so many other bands, they are capable of structuring brilliant pop that is both musically and lyrically effective.  <br /> <br />Therefore, if you are interesting in refreshing, abrasive guitar-based pop that perfectly captures a current moment in time and moments that occur in the individual lives of many, buy this album. Now.
B000002LR6|5.0|WOW~!!<br /><br />I am a die-hard Pantera fan. I love Skynyrd, Metallica, Slayer, etc...<br /><br />In all honesty- I haven't listened to Ministry before.<br /><br /> Usually I will buy CD's of artists that I have heard in the past- and I get hooked on that music-- and I don't listen to the radio that much at all- only those CD's.<br /><br />....BUT...today I was listening - THANKFULLY- to the radio.<br /><br /> I heard (on Denver's 106.7 KBPI) \\"Jesus Built My Hotrod\\" by Ministry.<br /><br />WOW- WAS I EVER HOOKED!!<br /><br />IT TOTALLY ROCKED!!<br /><br />So, I am buying this CD right now and I will add this to my CD collection that I play continuously.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I'd like to start out by pointing out something to the people who keep ripping on Maynard because they never get what they expect out of him:  Your opinion does not matter, because your narrowmindedness stops you from ever hearing the good.  People who say \\"this is weak and powerless haha\\" or \\"lyrically this cd is horrible and is boring\\" are ignorant, and i'm glad they don't like this cd, because fools don't deserve to hear true music like this.   <br />This cd must be listened to with open mind and open ears. <br /> <br />Maynards lyrics are deep and haunting, and although this cd isn't as hard as the last, it most definately still holds its own.  Sorry kids, just because this cd wont make you look cool while listening to it (in your eyes) doesn't mean its a bad cd, or boring for that matter.  The point of music is to listen to it, and obviously people aren't doing so. <br /> <br />-Weak and Powerless is an amazing song, and everyone already knows that.   <br />-Blue is deep song, with great lyrics and is put together well. <br />-Vanishing... is an eerie song that starts with a driving beat.  The guitar provides ambience, and brings out the songs indescribable beauty. <br />-The Outsider is one of the singles so obviously its one of the better songs on the cd, althought its not one of my favorites. <br />-The Nurse Who Loved Me is a delightfully twisted song, with amazing singing by Maynard. Many people seem to not like this song, its different, but so beautiful. <br />-Pet is a dark song, and most definately my favorite on the cd.  It somewhat reminds me of silent hill 4: the room.  <br />-Lullaby follows pet's lyrics. <br /> <br />Those are the songs that really stood out to me in this cd. Although at first I thought Mer De Noms was much better than this cd, Thirteenth Step continues to grow on me more and more.
B0002TT0NW|4.0|Though i enjoyed all the HP movies i believe this one strayed a bit much from the book. Too much was left out or altered for me to give a higher rating. I also was disappointed in the new Dumbledore. Not to insult the replacement actor but he seems to appear a bit goofy rather than wise as the other was. Hopefully they'll come out with an extended version later as this could probably make a 4-5 hour movie to do it justice.
068987474X|5.0|I've read all the reviews on this book.  Look - the author says, \\"I'm not a doctor, I'm not an expert, I'm just a dude.\\"  He's telling you his opinion as an everyday guy, which is the type of guy that most of us date.  I've seen a few reviews saying, \\"Every relationship is different.\\"  Granted, but most of them are pretty much the same and a lot of woman are wasting time chasing after guys that are 'JUST NOT THAT INTO US'.  It's that simple.  \\"He's just not that into you\\" is an easy read, full of witty comments and rude awakenings.  This book is meant to help us see the warning signs and act quickly on them instead of wasting your our and living in a fantasy world.
B0001ME5L2|5.0|I was startled by this girl from Napanee, Ontario (try finding it on a map, sometime), when she first appeared on VH1 and MTV a few years back with \\"Let Go\\" and the overplayed \\"Complicated.\\"  I loved her debut, but let's face it, the lyrical content was less than impressive and she seemed to have music that was a little too cutesy for my taste.  That sort of music has its place, but there was something that I felt Avril had that she wasn't making full use of: a surplus of potential.  What caught my ear was her impressive vocal ability.  She has an ability to carry a tune, but lots of people have that.  What blew my mind was the edge she could put into it.  There's a feeling in every word.  She doesn't try to be Britney Spears or any of the others.  She has her own very well placed rough edges that seep through even to the casual listener.  Now she releases this album, and RELEASE is the right word.  It was probably jumping off the shelf.  Her vocals are even more impressive now, this time backed with substance, and the music. The music has more variety than the previous album.  On the first single, \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" the guitar has a stylish crunch. Contrasting this are the moody tones of \\"Nobody's Home,\\" and the soft piano on \\"My Happy Ending.\\" All in all, \\"Under My Skin\\" shows artistic maturity and a realistic quality that lends credence to Avril's growth from teen star to adult musician.  If you like female vocalists, or you're interested in a breath of fresh air, Avril's a good ticket. I give her 5 stars on this latest of her works, and look forward to future successes for her.  That's my girl!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I am not a Christian or a Buddhist though I respect both. I am an ethical humanist. What strikes me reading these reviews is how Western capitalism is so sneaky. I respond YES that I want and need more in my life beyond illusion. Then I find this way of being in the world so difficult. My teenage daughter is also so bombarded daily with commercial crap. I can either be like Satine and accept it or I can fight it. It's so easy to delude oneself and say, \\"OK, I accept this or that material thing but I don't take it to heart\\". In my close to 50 years I have learned that this is always a mistake. What brought me to ethical culture to begin with was the realization that I must be profound and have courage in dealing with our American culture. Why do we like Satine so much? Why does Christian fall in love with her? Because diamonds and sex and energy have such an allure! You don't have to be a young person to feel it, either. <br /> <br />Thanks.
B00004RF98|5.0|Signing in the Rain has to be the best musical ever. Debbie Reynolds is perfect in her role, and her voice is amazing. Gene Kelly is completely amazing, one of the most talented movie actors ever. And Donald O'Conner is just amazing. But Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont was my absolute favorite.<br /><br />This movie gave us great classic songs like \\"Good Morning\\" and \\"Singing in the Rain\\". This is a great fun musical. I completely enjoyed it.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|This band's music is destined to be played on some WB show or future \\"hip\\" TV commercial selling metrosexual denim jeans. <br /> <br />Save your money. This band and their contrived music should be banished to Pitcairn Island. If you're hankering for Australian bands try The Mark of Cain or good ole Birthday Party. Hell. Go buy some Kylie Minogue.
B000002KO3|5.0|I love this album. It's without a doubt one of the greatest albums made in the 1980s. It's eccentrically accesible. It combines funk, African beats, the influence of Brian Eno (collaborator and co-producer on this album), and the Talking Heads' bizarre style of punk/New Wave, crammed into 8 wonderful songs. The opener \\"Born Under Punches\\" is one of the best songs ever, based around one hypnotic groove, David Byrne's varied intense vocals, and the setting of paranoia (I kinda think the song is about government oppression). The first side also includes \\"Crosseyed and Painless\\" and the danceable chaos of \\"The Great Curve,\\" which includes a crazy guitar solo by future King Crimson guitar wizard, Adrian Belew. \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" is one of their greatest singles, with lyrics that are really contemplative, and they keep bringing on songs you can dance to (and appreciate artisically) with \\"Houses in Motion.\\" The ending song, \\"The Overload\\" is a droning song that sounds like it could be on a Brian Eno record, even though the album winds down after \\"Houses in Motion\\" so by the time you get to \\"The Overload\\" you're ready for this record to wind down. Great record. Buy it if you like music.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|The Bourne Supremacy has some things in common with The Bourne Identity, its fast pace and its excellent characterisation. It is even superior in terms of dramatic tension but I believe it falls down a little on plot (slightly shaky) and action scenes.<br /><br />Watching fight scenes in The Bourne Identity was great, all of the actions are clear, fast, crisp and well executed. In The Bourne Supremacy they are still good but are filmed in a very different style. Shots changes rapidly, are clipped, close in and ultimately I found them difficult to follow. Obviously meant to make you feel like you are part of the fight but this doesn't work for me and the style is one I don't enjoy.<br /><br />That said, the style changes do however make sense in terms of flavour. In Bourne Identity Jason is totally off balance (figuratively) and only comfortable doing the things which come automatically (fighting, driving etc) and this is reflected in the filming. In Bourne Supremacy he is a different man, fighting for a different reason and for the majority of the movie he is badly shaken which is again reflected in the style of the filming.<br /><br />Different but still far better than your average action movie. Clever and entertaining but not fresh (but what do you expect from a sequel). At least it wasn't a clone of the original because they never succeed.
B00004RFFI|4.0|LOL, this movie is on now, and the older I get, the cornier the movie gets.  This movie is way Hollywood and it makes me laugh The effects are cheesy and the story is predictable.

0061020710|4.0|The great city of Ankh-Morpork has seen many tourists, but this one--Twoflower, from the mysterious counterweight continent, a continent reported to consist largely of gold--is different. His gullible appearance attracts an army of thieves but Twoflower is too innocent to even notice--and his walking luggage is dangerous enough to offer some protection. One of the men hoping to take advantage of Twoflower is Ankh-Morpork's worst mage. Rincewind knows only one spell. Unfortunately, he doesn't know what the spell will actually do if he uses it. When Twoflower pays Rincewind, in advance, to show him around the city, Rincewind decides to get out while he still can. Unfortunately, he's misjudged his timing. The Patrician wants Twoflower alive and decides to task Rincewind with the assignment. No one can escape the Patrician so Rincewind gets caught up in a series of inprobable adventures.<br /><br />THE COLOR OF MAGIC is the first in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series--and it shows. Pratchett hasn't quite decided whether Discworld is pure farce--with its counterparts for Robert E. Howard's Conan and Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser and his choice of a purely cowardly and incapable wizzard for protagonist with the most frightening monster being a many-legged travelling trunk--or something unique and wonderful. Over time, Pratchett has developed Discworld to be a compelling universe of its own, with complex characters, interesting situations, but keeping its tongue-in-cheek attitude. COLOR is essential reading for a full understanding of Discworld and fans of the series (like me) won't want to miss it. Still, although COLOR is the first Discworld novel, I don't recommend you read it first. Read some of the later stories, get hooked, then pick up COLOR to see where it came from and to get more of the details on how, exactly, a disc-shaped world travels on the backs of four elephants--each of whom, in turn, stands on a single huge turtle swimming toward--well, that is the question, isn't it?at is the question, isn't it?

B00005JMH2|3.0|I'm really surprised at all the positive reviews here. What did I miss? <br />I went to see this movie for the dancing, Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere, in that order. I hoped it would have something to say about marriage, romance and dance. Although there were some good individual scenes, I mostly felt the movie never jelled. <br /> <br /> The comedy scenes were self-conscious, as if directed by someone who couldn't do comedy; the dramatic scenes were a little better, but hampered by a total lack of real character development. We never know these people well enough to care.  <br /> <br />That was particularly, painfully true of the Jennifer Lopez character. That wasn't entirely her fault. She's given little to do, not even enough dancing in the movie.  <br /> <br />The two scenes of semi-romantic banter with Richard Gere were particularly painful to watch. They have no chemistry, and the dialogue is banal and not even original. Unless I'm much mistaken, their exchange about suede coats, stains and cows comes from a Seinfeld episode. This would have been fine if they'd referenced it; as it is, it's just a rip off. <br /> <br />The best scenes in the movie are those between Sarandon and the detective, with their hint of romantic possibilities. Still, Sarandon's big scene in which she explains the meaning of marriage, though great, felt out of step with the rest of the movie.  <br /> <br />The final flaw was that I felt Gere was miscast. He did fine in the dancing. It's great to see a man willing to work at that and I had no problem with it. (And got a kick out of character's explanation for why he's taking dance classes: \\"I'm lousy in bed, like Chic.\\")  <br /> <br />Still, it was hard to accept him as a man worn out and bored by life. The movie didn't have enough depth of script, direction or acting to overcome the vitality he projects. At least not for me. <br /> <br />As it was I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what was the basic problem: script, direction or editing. I'm still not sure. It did have some feel good moments. The best part turned out to be the end, when they show what happened to everyone. The audience seemed relatively pleased, though some described it as OK or not bad. Judged by the other reviews here, it should be modestly successful, anyway. <br />
0066620996|4.0|In today's world being \\"good\\" means multiplexing one's time between competing causes; only to creating the right balance leads to enduring \\"greatness.\\"  I found Jim Collins' book to be a starting point for understanding and prioritizing those factors that may contribute to success.  What I found most useful from this book were the stimulating ideas that served as the foundation for honest introspection.  Here are some of the questions I asked myself after reading this book: <br /> <br />What is your \\"Hedgehog concept?\\"  Why do you spend time on anything but your Hedgehog concept? <br /> <br />In what areas are you most undisciplined?  Do you strictly adhere to the internal systems of your workplace?  If not is this because you do not trust the systems, because the systems are too overburdening, because of laziness, because you never really questioned the usefulness of these systems, etc.? <br /> <br />What percentage of time do you give to developing workplace relationships (the \\"who\\") vs. developing new ideas (the \\"what\\")?  Is this a conscious balance or did it just happen this way?  Is this the correct balance? <br /> <br />Identify a time in which \\"the brutal facts of reality\\" may have challenged or shaken your long-term vision.  How did you deal with this challenge?  Did you respond by changing your near-term focus or your long-term goal?  Was your reaction appropriate in retrospect? <br /> <br />Are you driven by fear of competition or an intrinsic compulsion to create? <br /> <br />I gave this book 4/5 stars because of its inconclusive and unenlightening description of the \\"Level 5 Leader.\\"  I would be hard-pressed to describe the distinguishing qualities of a level 5-leader beyond modesty, ambition, and the willingness to pass on the torch.  These qualities seemed to be quaint observances of chance qualities of the selected leaders of the 11 chosen companies.  The book seemed to put forth the idea that these individuals did not really stand out from the crowd; this is good and fine, except that the reason I read that chapter in the first place was to determine what made those individuals stand out.  How do these leaders stand apart from Level 4 (and below) leaders?  What, exactly, is a Level 4 leader?  The discussion was not enough to really serve as an introspective foundation for greatness. <br />

0676973779|5.0|Life of Pi is an amazing novel. It truly is. I often hear of people reading it for a while and giving up, but  stick to it and see what you think the deeper you get into it. I, for one, was rather intrigued from the very beginning. I became less so as the novel progressed and detailed Pi's religious movements. I put the book down and all but forgot about it, until one day I realised it was missing. It turns out my father had started reading it. I snatched it back and read on, and on, and on. The novel takes a drastic but wonderful turn placing our character in a life boat with a few animals from his family's zoo-a hyena, an orangutang, a zebra, and Richard Parker, the tiger. It goes on for another forever, this time with Pi trying to survive the impossible. Amazing, unbelievable things happen. Read the comments on this bookjacket. I agree with every one of them.<br />This is the most unique novel I have ever read, and should be recognised and classed as a great piece of literature.<br />Props to Yann Martel, a true artist.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Brilliant says it. This is an awesome album, so beautiful and lithe. Truly a shining example of Davis' genius. And still, not one of his more known albums. Play this, then mix it up with A Tribute to Jack Johnson, for some minimal then funky Miles. In A Silent Way is engaging, and profoundly peaceful. Gorgeous.
B00008S2VG|4.0|This is not the best Madonna album out there, but it's still very good. It's Madonna - what do you expect! I was one of the lucky ones to get tickets for one of her shows in London and she is still on top! The most amazing show I've ever seen. Been a fan for 18 years now and she's better than ever. I have huge respect for her. My favourite song on this album would be Hollywood. Easy Ride is quite incredible also, sound very gothic. People are putting her down for doing the rap on American Life but it's really well done. This is reinvention. That's why she's so popular. Can't wait for her next album.
B000002TQB|5.0|It took me some time to get to like this album. I could decribe it as having three layers: On first listen, all the songs are catchy and listenable, but don't seem to have much substance. For awhile the album seems superficial. Then, if you listen carefully, pay attention to the lyrics and listen to whole thing straight through, the power of Parklife becomes apparent. It is a full, freestanding work of art, cohesive and brilliant, and ultimately far deeper than many an assortment of gushy ballads. <br /> <br />Girls & Boys - Terrific, incredibly addictive tune, drawling and decadent, one of the stronger standalone songs on the album (rightfully, since it was a single). <br /> <br />Tracy Jacks - Upbeat, singalong chorus, inspiring tale of a man who dared to...bulldoze down his own house. Light, but fun. <br /> <br />End of a Century - Tied for my personal favorite. Short, but intricate and haunting. The first example of what Blur will do many times on this album - concealing a devastating lyric in the package of an almost upbeat pop song. <br /> <br />Parklife - The album's other big name. A hit, and a great song, but not really characteristic of the album as a whole (funny it was called that, then). <br /> <br />Bank Holiday - For some reason I think this song is hysterical. Very working-class. <br /> <br />Badhead - Continuing in the style of End of a Century. Elegant, funky music, terrifically sad song. <br /> <br />The Debt Collector - One of two short, offbeat instrumentals (something Albarn seems to like, given also his Closet Romantic contribution to the Trainspotting soundtrack). I like it, but not as much as the other instrumental, the last track. <br /> <br />Far Out - Not much to see here, but fits in the album well. <br /> <br />To the End - And another major song. I like the simple lyrics on this one. <br /> <br />London Loves - This is the money track. It ends a bit weakly, but I think it really sums up modern society better than almost anything at all. The lyric is just so brilliant - could listen to it over and over. \\"He loves the violence / keeps ticking over...\\" <br /> <br />Trouble in the Message Center - Yet another very eerie track, with engimatic lyrics. Pairs well with London Loves. <br /> <br />Clover Over Dover - A tragic sort of old-fashioned ballad, as catchy as bubblegum pop. Another very characteristic track for the album. <br /> <br />Magic America - Possibly _the_ most catchy track, and certainly single material. It gets a bit old once you've listened to it for the umpteenth time, but a very,very clever song. <br /> <br />Jubilee - Muddy lyric and not too catchy; not really fond of it. Somewhat interesting character study. <br /> <br />This is a Low - Fitting, darkly epic closer. I'm not sure it's one of Blur's best songs, but it certainly does give you that feeling of wrenching modern despair prefaced by End of a Century, Badhead, London Loves etc., leading perfectly into-- <br /> <br />Lot 105 - This is what seals the album's brilliance for me. Following a sweeping ballad like This is a Low with this little minute-long snatch of catchy lounge music. I love this 'song' to pieces. <br /> <br />It may be more of a _grower_ than you'd expect, but Parklife rewards on many levels. A definite classic.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is a pure rock experience from Green Day that goes beyond any expectation you may have had.  When I first looked at the track listing, I was a little confused by two of the songs that were divided into about 5 sub-songs, but after listening to them, I was pleased with the experiment's results.  These mini-songs are all harmonized and prove that although Green Day still struggles to write a song over two minutes, each song is amazing.   <br />     The \\"American Idiot\\" single is misleading to the rest of the album.  It sounds like it could have been taken off of one of their previous albums.  The rest of the CD, however, shows a much more mature Green Day who proves that they can still rock. <br />     Some highlights of the CD include \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" and most every song on the album, really. <br />     The perfect vocal harmonies, rolling drums, and pop-punk sound still sound like Green Day, but this CD shows that the band has gone and reinvented itself again with their strongest album yet.  Many songs are destined to become radio singles, but I can only hope that this album stays as pure as the day it was released.
B00005JN7O|2.0|The movie was amazing, except for the character Polly Perkins, I am so disturbed by this character, That I have write this review as soon as get home from the cinema. Never see a lead lady so stupid that she should be the villain of the movie. If there is any sequel, please kill Polly Perkins. Any way, great special effect. It should be a 4 stars, but Polly Perkins just robbed the other two.
0385292244|5.0|This book, along with Lord of the Rings and Animal Farm, are book I must marvel at. <br /> <br />The wisdom, the history, everything perfect - yet with enough intended flaws to make it human. A thouroughly satisfying experience. <br /> <br />After reading this tome of Feudal Japan you will feel satiated yet empty, you will feel glad you have been given the privilidge of knowing the story yet sad you have to leave the characters that have become almost like comrades to you. <br /> <br />I reccomend this and all of Clavell's Asian saga, as I have read them all. By far, this is Clavell's most complete work, his most convoluted and sincere. <br /> <br />This is a masterpiece.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Having seen the video for 'Time is Running Out' and read many an article about their fame and acclaim abroad going into Curiosa, I was a little skeptic - I lie - very skeptic. I will even go so far as to say that I DID NOT want to like Muse; however during the band's performance at Curiosa, I couldn't help but smirk: one, because Matt Bellamy is a bit of a show off, and two, because I was actually enjoying it.     As for Absolution, it's a great album -- 4.5 stars, unfortunately Amazon doesn't provide half stars. Yes, Bellamy's voice has a striking resemblance to a certain Thom, however Muse takes on a classical music approach in terms of structure and sound unlike Yorke.     ber-cool magazine, Under the Radar, put it best: \\"Absolution comes from a deep, dark place and Muse are the perfect guides. With breath-taking energy, and an endless drive to push their own boundaries, they lead us through a world of pain, darkness and death. But underneath the nihilism is an optimism and hope that says the worst pain is born of love, that darkness can be as comforting as it is terrifying and that the struggle against death is the most passionate celebration of life.

B0001YRVN4|5.0|Everything is great, the design, the box, the multiples menus, the dvd's, I am a fan, a true fan and I'm not agree wiyh the people that says that Mr. Lucas \\"raped\\" a masterpiece or made changes, always Mr. Lucas wanted to be the Star Wars Trilogy like this, but in the 70's and 80's did'nt has the resources, in Episode IV: A new Hope; and the technology in Episode V and VI, I respect the people that did'nt like the changes but, we can't forget that Mr. Lucas is the creator, the father of STAR WARS, and he can do whatever he thinks is necesary to do a better and credible story (efx), I'am 26 year old male, and I cry when I saw the end of Episode VI.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I obviously have a different views than many others that reviewed this DVD.  I acknowledge that it did not follow exactly to the plot of the book, but i still found it entertaining.  i was not angry that it did not follow the exact plot, because i can still see this as a harry potter movie.  however, this did not have a sufficeint(sp?) helping of one of the things i love about the Harry Potter books and movies.  It lacked the day to day hogwarts enviroment and flavor that JKR developed so masterfully.  that was one of my favorite things about these books and movies.  It was still a good movie, and i plan to add it to my collection.    P.S.- the reveiwer a few down was correct, Dumbledore's fill in was not as wise looking as the old one.  He just didn;t have that \\"wizard\\" feel to him
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I'm fairly certain this review won't help anyone understand the movie but I felt I had to comment on this movie. <br /> <br />*Ahem* Why must the main characters wear sunglasses whenever they enter the Matrix? I was confused as to why they wore sunglasses in elevators and rooms without windows.  <br /> <br />Why was the best fight-scene in the movie made entirely from computer graphics? When Neo fought his arch-enemy, or more appropriately, arch-enemies, after consulting the Oracle, it was computerized to the point where it reminded me of Mortal Kombat or Dead or Alive video games. If only I could plug into the T.V. and help out Neo. <br /> <br />Why does the architect merely sit around watching T.V. all day? He created the Matrix yet he has nothing to do... <br /> <br />What's up with the French villian in the restaurant? Doesn't he have passion for his wife anymore? She's beautiful yet he goes to restaurants and watches other women get off from his drug laced tiramisus. What a pervert! He thinks he's cool but he's not. He probably goes to Denny's and does the same thing on the local soccer moms. <br /> <br />Since when did Neo become a Kryptonian? Whenever I see him fly I have the urge to sing the Mighty Mouse theme: \\"Here I come to save the daaaaay!\\" <br /> <br />Whatever happened to the other guy from Bill and Ted? Whenever I watch this movie I always wonder about him. <br /> <br />What happened past the part where Neo revives Trinity? I've never gotten past that part.
B00000JRTX|4.0|Never have I been so impressed with a film as I was with Mike Newell's British romp, Four Weddings and a Funeral.  I can honestly say that this was one of those films that needed to have strong definitive characters to make the story work, and Newell accomplished this task with the greatest of ease.  While he had done some work prior to this film, America was introduced to a very funny and very British Hugh Grant for the first time.  His amazing and singular work in this film skyrocketed him to his level in Hollywood today.  He could not have found a better step ladder.<br /><br />This film is funny, insightful, witty, and very personable.  It is hard to find films of this caliber created by Hollywood anymore, so thankfully we have this film.  Everything from the soundtrack (boasting several American songs), to the deeply humorous and intuitive references to American \\"pop\\" culture, to Hugh Grant's use of a certain word time over time, only keeps this film above all others.  This is definitely one of those films that should be watched when life seems to be dragging and you need a bowl of laughter in your life.  It should also be used by anyone that is a fan of British humor.  It will turn any day into sunshine.<br /><br />Overall, this was a surprising film when I watched it for the first time, and it continues to impress.  I am not a huge fan of Andie MacDowell, so it sometimes perplexes me as to why she chose this project, but thankfully this is counteracted by one of Hollywood's most classic scenes involving Rowan Atkinson!  That man can do no wrong!  I suggest this film to everyone at least once.  It may not be everyone's \\"cup of tea\\", but watching it once caused nobody harm.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****
0393057658|5.0|Okay, I admit I rarely watch baseball. Like many unknowledgeable viewers, I find the game slow.  Sure, my friends say, there's lots of strategy. But it's not the kind of game you can just watch a few times a year, like football, and still get involved.<br /><br />But this book is only secondarily about baseball. As a career consultant who helps clients navigate tough decisions, I'm fascinated by the psychology of decision-making, and I read everything I can find.  All the research comes to the same conclusion: statistics win over experience, every time.<br /><br />And that's the story of Money Ball. A contrarian GM looks at the numbers to choose undervalued players. To Billy Beane, each player is an asset in a portfolio. His goal is to buy undervalued assets and sell overvalued assets.<br /><br />The difference: Investors just hold assets in their portfolio. Billy Beane is more like a real estate investor who fixes up houses or waits till the world comes to his small town.  After buying undervalued players, he showcases their true value by setting them on the playing field. A pitcher who \\"looks funny\\" turns out to be a star. An over-the-hill player thrives in a new position.<br /><br />So what's the lesson for the rest of us?<br /><br />First, Lewis raises the question of valuing people who do different kinds of jobs, where results aren't measured as easily. Ultimately, we're all assets. Employees working for a large firm need to regard themselves and their employees with the same kind of detachment. Investments in HR programs either raise the value of their assets or they're a waste of money.<br /><br />And there's an inadvertent lesson here, too. Statistics help Billy Beane choose undervalued players so he can win division titles with a smaller budget than the competition. But when Billy faced his own big decision -- accept a Stanford scholarship or go pro immediately -- he had no statistics. We still need a method to make those kinds of decisions, and that's why I enjoy working with my career changing clients.  You need more than a comparison of pros and cons.and that's why I enjoy working with my career changing clients.  You need more than a comparison of pros and cons.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0385336810|5.0|I am a big reader, and read lots of different genres.  Lately, I have found that whenever I need to veg out on my lunch break or after work, I love the silly British girl genre.  This book falls nicely into this category, as do Bridget Jones and Shopaholic.  I found Can you Keep a Secret to be a guilty pleasure-fun, fanciful reading.  Nothing to make me think too hard!  The characters are great, and I just love the premise of the man knowing all the secrets.  I highly recommend this as airplane, beach or Christmas vacation reading.  Enjoy yourself.
B000069HK2|5.0|This album is amazing from the first track to the end it rocks. I'm an old schooler I grew up listening to The Replacements, U2, REM, The Clash. So I very rarely like the new stuff out today it all sounds the same. But I picked up this cd after hearing them on MTV2 late one night. I'm glad I did to say Burt McCracken sings with emotion is an understatement. The song writing is outstanding he wears his heart on his sleave this album.  My favorite tracks are \\"Box Full of Sharp Objects which is my fave on whole cd, \\"Maybe Memories \\"Buried Myself Alive, \\"Bulimic. Very well produced album but still has a gritty sound to it. More intense band than the stuff out today with intelligent lyrics that still rock hard. Great live in concert too. One of the best if not best newer band out today. I can't wait to hear their follow up softmore album.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|Green Day's latest release \\"American Idiot\\" not only reconsolidates their status as the best punk rock band the industry has ever seen, but also introduces a new, more mature sound to their repertoire. While earlier albums matched \\"American Idiot\\" in terms of lyrical content, passion and all out masterful songwriting, this album supersedes its predecessors in its ability to encapsulate a more wide range of musical styles, while incorporating a bigger sound.  <br /> <br />Billie Joe Armstrong long ago proved his immense talent as an all-round artist, with the band's first two breathtaking albums \\"39/Smooth\\" and \\"Kerplunk\\". \\"Dookie\\" and \\"Insomniac\\" saw Green Day break into the mainstream market and \\"Nimrod\\" was diversionary from their previous emphasis on the classic punk rock formula. \\"Warning\\" revealed a more introspective and serene Green Day, perhaps lacking the ferociousness of previous efforts. \\"American Idiot\\" now proves that the band can conquer the mainstream market while maintaining the sincerity and passion for which they have been reknowned. <br /> <br />As a long-term Green Day fan, I highly recommend this album. Not only does it have some amazing songs, it comes as a complete package of brilliant lyrics, fantastic instrumentals and near-perfect melodies sung by the most talented Billie Joe. The songs are complementary to each other, running predominantly in a medley format and come hard and fast to the listener. What is perhaps the album's greatest strength is its ability to tackle issues of paramount significance in today's world. This runs parallel to the themes of love and rage, that are universal in nature and thus relevant to all of humanity. <br /> <br />In short: buy this CD! You are sure to love it!
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This concert ranks among the very best. The dedication of every musician is amazing. The recording is incredible. Every musician lives up to is promise. This a must have in the collection. BUY IT!!!!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Why are there so many bitter, negative reviews of this movie?  Simply because this is a powerful movie that will influence the way that you think about important contemporary issues.   <br /> <br />This movie presents a sobering, at times shocking, look at our President's actions since 9-11.   <br /> <br />The President's links to Saudi Arabia, and to Saudi money have been documented in other places, but it is compelling to see it on the screen.  Perhaps most interesting is the time President Bush sat reading \\"My Pet Goat\\" while the country was under attack.   <br /> <br />The movie also presents some footage from our troops in Iraq.  It is good to see footage of troops that is a more honest look at their lives in Iraq then you normally see on perky, everybody's-happy news programs.   <br /> <br />The movie closes by following the grief of a mother who has lost her son in Iraq.  If that doesn't break your heart, nothing will. <br /> <br />The extras on the DVD make purchasing this item well worth it, even if you saw the movie in the theater.   <br /> <br />Many people argue that this movie is bad because \\"it is a documentary and it is supposed to provide an objective view of the facts\\".  I am a graduate student studying research methods, and it is clear to me that no research, or documentary for that matter, can be completely objective.  No matter how hard you try, everything you write or create is influenced by you, and therefore, not completely objective.  So, think of this movie as an editorial - it uses facts to prove a point.  The point Mr. Moore would like to make is that the Bush administration has made many mistakes and inexusable judgments since 9/11, and should be voted out of office this November.
B0002OERI0|3.0|I'm a huge Green Day fan, but this is a very upsetting album to listen to. I personally am part of a redneck agenda and love this country, so of course songs such as American Idiot can completely turn me off from this album. However, songs such as Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Jesus of Suburbia are two great tracks. They truly are a great band. I just wish they, and the rest of the rock world, would steer clear from politics.
B0002I831S|4.0|I am glad I waited to purchase these as boxed sets.  I feel for people who wasted all the money buying the 2 episode disks, but I admit that while it is wonderful to have the entire season in one set and the quality is pretty good, I am thouroughly disappointed with the packaging.  It's less of a hassle than the TNG sets which I can never keep the little book from falling out or I have to set it on the floor to open it to the disk I need to get to, but this pack is junky and doesn't fit in my shelving very well.  Also at the price, I was disappointed they couldn't come up with a audo commentary on each episode.  All the cast but one are still alive and from the interviews so are many writers and directors of original episodes.  Text commentaries are ok, but these weren't all that imformative in any case.  Star Trek needs to take lessons from Dr. Who on text commentaries.  All and all I'd say go for this, but as I noted in some other reviews, there will probably be a super mega aniversary set to include all the stuff I want so you may want to wait until the mega ultimate fan-boy collector's gold trim multi-hold jumbo expanded edition comes out -- ha ha -- mike
0783116934|5.0|I think everything has pretty much been said in the previous reviews.  Citizen X has that \\"Wow-factor\\" to it.  Also, this movie is haunting.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|\\"Lost In Translation\\" is a looser. Bill Murray is his typical dead-pan dull self projecting the same persona he has perfected in all his other films from his \\"Stripes\\" and \\"Ghost Busters\\" days. He is a straight man in search of a side kick to breath life into his act. He has not found one to date.  <br /> The story is about a man out of his culture. Bill Murray plays the American buffoon stumbling into and around in a land (Japan) totally alien to him. Do you want an in-depth analysis of the story line? I just gave it to you. This film is not that deep. <br /> If you are a Bill Murray groupie you will love this film. If you are a Bill Murray groupie you need to get out to other films. Rent some films with Ben Kingsley in them if you want to see a versatile actor. Broaden your horizons. <br /> I am always in search of something good to say about a movie...ah, a colleague lent me this DVD so I didn't pay a cent. There you have it, a positive aspect of \\"Lost In Translation.\\"  <br />
B0002XVQNU|5.0|If you're going to criticize a film, at least know what you're talking about!  Michael Clark Duncan was NOT in Pulp Fiction.  That was Ving Rhames.   <br /> <br />I liked Daredevil quite a bit, but I think I will love this version of the movie.  It sounds like key sections of the film were left on the cutting room floor to make for a more streamlined version of the movie.  Too bad!  Here's hoping that the Director's Cut will give us more of Matt Murdock and his personal journey.
B0002VC924|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is my choice for best film of 2004. I had seen it two times on opening weekend and at both viewings it got a standing ovation. Though I don't always agree with what Michael Moore has to say there was no disagreeing with this film.
B0002VKZL6|3.0|I have been a long time Dire Straits fan, and loved \\"Golden Heart\\", Knopfler's first solo CD. I agree with many of the previous reviewers. The last two CDs (\\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" and \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\") went down a different road than the one Knopfler took with Dire Straits and even with \\"Golden Heart\\". While I appreaciate everything Mark Knopfler does, and usually buy his new releases without even hearing them first, I was hoping for more of an energized sound. When one compares \\"Shangri La\\" to \\"Love Over Gold\\", it is hard to imagine the same creative force made both CDs. I liked \\"Shangri La\\" but was hoping for more.
0553103547|4.0|This book has a rather slow start. The characters, at first, seem rather wooden or trite, and the landscape Martin paints for us, in this world of extreme seasons, takes a little adjusting to.<br /><br />As the set up gives way to the unfolding of the plot, which takes off like a rocket about one hundred and fifty pages in, any history buff will see that this is a fantasy retelling of England's War of the Roses. More than that, it's a tribute, twisted though that may seem.<br /><br />Characters that at first seemed wooden burst onto the forefront and come to life, and those that seemed trite, turn right around and surprise us. No one is what they seem.<br /><br />It would be a very long review if I highlighted some of Martin's characters, for there are many worth mentioning, whose stories we follow through an array of sub plots.<br /><br />While the book is not difficult to follow and I have truly enjoyed it, there is plenty to keep track of in this dangerous world that Martin creates, and he has to take the time to set it up. You gotta pay attention, and having paid attention once, I don't see myself paying attention again for a few years which is about how long it will be before I re-read this book. And I will re-read it, especially if the following books just keep it all getting better.
1400032717|4.0|This is a story written through the eyes of a mildly autistic boy who is trying to solve the mystery of the neighbour's dog murder, and stumbles into a number of other `revelations' on the way. <br /> <br />The book is both moving and funny (in both a laugh-out-loud and a sad kind of way) with an original plot and simple but flowing language, which makes it very easy to read in one sitting.  <br /> <br />Seeing life from Christopher's `simplified' and inherently logical point-of-view was a real eye-opener for me. And although that's not the purpose of the book, I think that every parent can benefit from this `inside' view of a child's mind. <br /> <br />Though it's probably not one of those books that will stay with me for life, it's well worth reading. <br />
6304068441|5.0|The movie has power and grace. It also makes a statement about the death penalty.  <br />Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon are excellent in this film.
B0002VKZL6|3.0|Awaiting even one rocking, cut-loose guitar solo is a losing proposition.  This CD is full of folksy songs, nicely delivered by a guitar god who never plays lead guitar.  Calling this Knopfler's most rocking album since Dire Straits is just WRONG.  It's placid and peaceful, mostly, but you never get the long-awaited Knopfler lead guitar, and that can only be disappointing.  Mark does play lead on a track on the new John Fogerty album, and he still has the chops.  Sadly, they are not displayed on this album at any time.  Ultimately, this won't be remembered as Knopfler's finest hour...more like just pasing time.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I am at peace with the condition of this release except for some scenes with inappropriate lightsaber colors.  The situation with the audio has already been discussed to death in these reviews, so I'll leave that one alone; suffice it to say that I have no speakers and I'm listening to this in mono, so I have low audio expectations anyway.    As far as the lightsaber issue is concerned: much to my surprise, I found that the WHITE CORES of the sabers do indeed return if you turn your contrast setting all the way up.    As our example, let's look at the scene where Luke and Vader's sabers cross in front of Palpatine.  With the contrast in the middle of the range, you can't see lightsaber cores; you see unsightly colored-in sabers with a very strange intersection, making it look like the sabers are in fact passing THROUGH one another.  Now ( without raising the contrast ) pop in the bonus disc and start the \\"Empire of Dreams\\" feature.  Watch the scenes in the beginning.  There's our lightsaber-cross scene again, except it's the way it's SUPPOSED to look!!!  I mean, I'm glad to be able to get the cores to come back, but shouldn't they be there on the average contrast setting, as with the clip in the documentary?  Having the saber cores makes the occasional inappropriate \\"edge\\" color less noticeable.  However, it's always troubling when film footage used in a DVD feature is of higher quality than that used in the film track itself.  As background for one of the menus on the bonus disc, Van Ling has used the scene where Luke practices with the remote on the Falcon.  Except in the menu background, the saber is the correct BLUE color, while in the corresponding scene on the actual Episode IV disc, it's GREEN.  How did this come about?  My guess is that coloration of the actual film tracks was the responsibility of Lowry Digital Images and was separate from Van Ling's task.  It seems that the saber coloration issue was obvious to Van Ling ( or someone ) and was corrected forthe bonus disc DVD menu.  How this correction did not make its way back up the hierarchy so that it was reflected in the released version of Episode IV is beyond me.    There are some interesting things to be found on the bonus disc, such as the outtake of Boba Fett shooting at an Ewok on the Death Star ( I wish it had been worked into one of the films even though it's wholly inconsistent ).  On the commentary of ROTJ I think it's implied that there will be some digital Wookiees in Episode III.  Also, Lucas mentions that the Emperor's tower on the Death Star II is stylistically connected to the spire of the Jedi Temple, which I hadn't realized.
B000075BFK|5.0|This album is awesome. The stand-out tracks include \\"Still Ballin'\\", \\"When We Ride On Our Enemies\\", \\"Changed Man\\", \\"Never Be Peace\\", \\"Mama's Just A Little Girl\\", \\"Street Fame\\", \\"What Ya Gonna Do\\", \\"My Block (Remix)\\", \\"Thug's Mansion\\", \\"Military Minds\\", \\"Fair Exchange (Remix)\\" & \\"They Don't Give A F**k About Us\\". The worst songs are \\"Thug's Mansion (Nas Acoustic)\\", \\"Never Call You B***h again\\", \\"Better Days\\" & \\"Late Night\\". This album features 2Pac's singles \\"Thug's Mansion (Nas Acoustic\\" & \\"Still Ballin'\\". Overall this is a fantastic album. If you are a big 2Pac fan (like I am) then you should definitely get this album. If you do not have any 2Pac albums get Greatest Hits, then get this.
0140177396|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men.  It was a great short novel in which Steinbeck keeps you interested from beginning to end.  The dialogue was great and helped you to learn more about the characters without getting a bunch of unneeded information.  This helps to keep the book short but you still get a lot of good information.  George and Lennie are the two main characters.  They are labor workers and travel from farm to farm looking for jobs to make money.  They have an amazing friendship, which everyone at the ranch admires.  Steinbeck puts a large emphasis on the importance of male friendship in the novel. They are trying to make enough money to buy there own land so they can be free of always having to worry about having a job or not.  George is a small man who keeps up with Lennie.  Lennie is very large and is almost considered mentally ill.  He loves to pet soft things and this can get him in trouble.  The novel ends up being sad but it is definitely well worth the read.
B00006690G|4.0|This is a good album. Although it is not neer as controversial as his last 2 albums, there are still quite a lot of stand-out tracks. Some of the stand-out tracks include: \\"'Till I Collapse\\" featuring Nate Dogg, \\"White America\\", \\"Square Dance\\", \\"Soldier\\", \\"When The Music Stops\\" featuring D12 & \\"Say What You Say\\" featuring Dr. Dre. This album features Eminem's hit singles \\"Without Me\\", \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\", \\"Sing For The Moment\\", \\"Business\\" & \\"Superman\\". This is a good album and is definitely worth having in your collection. If you don't have it, get it as soon as possible.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This CD Rocks. What is up with the Hilary Duff lover get them off...just stay with your little preppy hip hop music and leave Green Day alone!!!  This CD is one of the best cds ive ever owned...their style rocks boulevard of broken dreams, holiday, jesus of suburbia, st jimmy, homecoming, and whatsername are the best tracks....period. I'm not into much political stuff and i ignore what they say even though most of it is true...This cd goes down in history as one of the best punk albums ever!!   (an btw, hilary duff can't sing and all those rappers are just talkin)
B0000C9V3T|5.0|If you've seen \\"Kill Bill, Vol. 1\\" you've gotta know that the music in the movie is amazing. This soundtrack is so fun - especially if you're a fan of the film. I don't know if I would recommend this CD to everybody because most of this CD is instrumental and might be boring for some. But if you love the movie and/or love the music in it, this LP is so worth it. \\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down\\" by Nancy Sinatra is the 1st song played in the movie and 1st track on this CD. It's such a good song, lyrically and vocally. My other favourites include \\"Twisted Nerve\\" - played when Elle Driver walks down the hallway of the hospital - \\"Woo Hoo\\" by the 5.6.7.8's, and Santa Esmeralda's \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\". My favourite part of the CD are the quotes taken from the movie and put into the CD (\\"Queen of the Crime Council\\" & \\"You're My Wicked Life\\"), I only wish there were more. <br /> <br />
6305531412|5.0|First off, allow me to correct a common mistake that was made by more than one reviewer here: This is most certainly not the first film ever made where animated characters interact with live actors. Pete's Dragon (1977), Mary Poppins (1964) and Song of the South (1946) all predate it, and if you want a lesson in cartoon history, so does Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). But that doesn't mean Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not a landmark film. It was revolutionary for its degree of interaction between the toons and the human characters, done so perfectly that they seem completely natural at first glance, but then amaze when you take a closer look - little things like Jessica Rabbit pinching Eddie Valiant's cheek, or Roger Rabbit hiding under the water in Valiant's sink, or beneath his coat, little details that took very creative special effects to be made convincing. It's also unique and original in the fact that some of it takes place in the real world, featuring animated characters, and some in an animated world, featuring live actors; and in that manner, it predates Cool World, Space Jam and anything following. <br /> <br />Who Framed Roger Rabbit is wonderfully funny, directed more at an adult audience than children. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd make a terrific impression in the lead roles, and manage to stay remarkably serious and convincing while conversing and interacting with entirely imaginary characters. Charles Fleischer is beyond brilliant in the voice of Roger Rabbit (as well as that of Benny the Cab) and Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit is also terrific, a femme fatale so classic that it's ridiculous. The entire film excels with intelligent humor that would appeal to both children and adults, and it's a treat for animation buffs, with references to historical toons from the Foxy cartoons of the 20s, through Betty Boop, Dumbo and Bambi to Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse. <br /> <br />Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the defining films of my childhood; I think that's true for almost anyone born in the 80s. I still have a warm place in my heart for Roger and Eddie Valiant, and a cold one for Judge Doom, who gave me nightmares for weeks after I saw it upon its initial release when I was four (he still gives me chills, by the way, when he first starts talking in his squeaky voice). If you somehow manages to avoid it, do watch it, and if you're willing, it's well worth the purchase, too.
B00005JLEU|5.0|'Spirited Away' will sweep you off you feet and send you on a thrilling adventure into Miyazaki's lushly animated world full of wonderful creatures and lovably bizarre characters in a movie that will captivate you for almost two hours. It certainly did me. <br /> <br />'Spirited Away' is such a rare treat in today's world with little new been done with conventional cartoons in the world of cinema. Instead, all the major studios are opting for CGI-driven movies that may please visually, but tend to lack in everything else. 'Spirited Away' is lavishly beautiful too the eye, yet is also a strongly structured tale that has the heart missing out of most modern-day animation making this movie really stand out from the crowd and a definite must-see. <br /> <br />The story focuses around a little girl named Chihiro who becomes deserted from her parents, only to return and find that they have been turned into pigs. Here she befriends the magically talented and graceful Haku, who safely guides her through, what the place she has found herself in, becomes after nightfall - a spa hotel for thousands of Japan's gods and spirits. Haku tells her that she must find work in there if she is to stay and find a way to break the spell on her parents before they become dinner for some of the hotel's demanding guests. <br /> <br />I could find little wrong with 'Spirited Away', which is a lot coming from someone who is always trying to find something wrong with everything. I was utterly captivated in this movie from start to finish. It has everything. Fantasy, the supernatural, comedy, drama... You name it, this movie has it. I've never found that I could recommend an animated movie as highly as I can with this luxurious tale. <br /> <br />The character design is fabulous meaning you're guaranteed to meet many kinds of gods, spirits, and creatures that you won't come across anywhere else. Some of the characters literally made me say \\"wow!\\" as they really are outstanding <br /> <br />'Spirited Away' is absolutely spellbinding throughout and worthy of all the praise it has, and will receive in the present and near future. <br /> <br />See it now!
B00005JNEI|1.0|First, I loved Roger and Me and its sequel.  Second, I think Michael Moore's politics has clouded his art.  With that said I think he has taken untold and incalculable risks in making this film for which he deserves a certain amount of credit.  However, if he wanted to further polarize an already divided electorate he has done just that.      The film plays fast and loose with the facts (Bin Ladens NOT being vetted by the FBI, being flown out of the country during the no fly days just after 9/11, lack of intelligence regarding Sadaam's WMD's, Florida voting intimidation, Mischaracterizing recounts in Florida of 2000...ad infinitum...ALL UNTRUE).  Michael Moore does not let the facts get in the way of a good story.  It is fiction from start to finish.  That doesn't mean it still wouldn't have been entertaining...it still could have been.    However, if there is one seminal piece of footage that sums up this film it is the 9/11 event itself.  This film goes in to absolute \\"Al\\" gore (pun intended) detail showing us the carnage of Iraqi civilian casualties and American GI injuries.  However, when it came to showing 9/11 footage the screen goes entirely blank with just some sound effects of plane crashing into the tower and the screams of some onlookers.  Moore's stated reason for this is clear...audience attention.  However, his unstated motivation is equally clear...the visual images of the 9/11 attacks, victims and carnage would not convey the message he needed.  In fact, it might invoke sympathy for those prosecuting the war on terror.  This was the most intellectually dishonest move in filmmaking, fact or fiction, history.    By now I'm sure you understand I'm no Michael Moore fan.  However, I like art.  After viewing this film...I'd just wish I'd seen some.    (...)
B0002OERI0|4.0|well if you don't like it, it's because you are republican, or you think you knew punk first and you are better than anything to come out after 1970. <br /> <br />this album is great, there are some great song writing components and recording techniques not seen in today's corporate controlled rock. <br /> <br />they have a lot of pull on their label and can do what they want, they aren't forced to do anything they don't want to. <br /> <br />so for any of the reviewers saying this sucks, it is because they hate seeing people not agree with every aspect of our country.   <br /> <br />maybe they will change their mind when they are drafted for a pointless war, or maybe they'll change their mind when their children are killed. <br /> <br />In the meantime, this is a great cd to listen to, and something to think about, period.

B00006AUIG|5.0|This film is one of the greatest suspense films of all times and yet has received so little attention. The director combines the suggestion of madness along with the weakness of the wounded human psyche to create a thrilling yet subtle terror movie. <br /> <br />Brad Anderson directs this film along the same route as Hitchcock, adding dim lighting, the illusion of fear and suggestions of madness around each and every bend. Filmed at Danvers State Mental Hospital the building itself is as creepy as can be with haunting hallways and torture gadgets, used on the unlucky and insane, lurking in every corner. Anderson allows this story to unfold without being overly graphic or campy. A five man crew is hired by the state to clean up the old hospital and rid it of the asbestos that is contaminating its walls but much to their surprise other contaminations exist. David Caruso is the crew negotiator suffering from anger related issues towards the crew man who stole his wife. His partner, Peter Mullan, is the first to become unknowingly sensitive to the evil that lurks in the walls. Another crew member discovers tapes in the basement that reveal the trauma of a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder and opens up more than he imagines. So in one week the crew is faced with various events that lead to a frightening conclusion. <br /> <br />Anderson opens up the definition of madness leading one to believe that we all carry a bit of it inside of us waiting to be ignited. In today's world where medication is the treatment rather than lobotomies it is a scary thought. Anderson manages to trigger our senses with eerie tapes and looming walls, suspending his viewers within the gloom of an empty madhouse. The voice of \\"Simon\\" grabs the weak and wounded how will he affect you? <br /> <br />
0743455967|5.0|I write technical books for a living and it certainly pays the bills. But like most writers, I want to write (and publish) fiction. I was burned out and discouraged when I picked up this book. By the time I put it down, however, I was anxious to get back to work. I only wish I could find other books as informative and inspirational as this one. <br /> <br />(And believe me, I never thought I'd use the word \\"inspirational\\" when discussing a Stephen King book.)
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|I'm always astonished how certain kinds of music can create such a buzz and be so incredibly bad. I don't think I've ever seen a band that had so many comparisons made to other bands. When I saw a review mention The Jam, I nearly lost it! How do you dare even consider comparing the genius writing of Paul Weller to this stuff? I agree with several other reviewers that this music will be forgotten in a very short time and another review that comments on the incredibly weak lyrics.Sometimes people try too hard to act like they're on top of the latest music trends and if that means endorsing mediocre music so be it.I guess it is a good sign that more people are searching for a true alternative to the mainstream crapola but when something is compared to 40 different bands and still isn't as good as any of them... you do the math.
B000063DGC|5.0|First I encounter some goof off claiming to be Eddie Van Halen on the new Best of Both Worlds review saying stuff like:\\"Sammy sucked man, David was the soul of the band\\". But now, Randy Rhoads, I just got to say: HAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!! That is so friggn hilarious!!! You could kill my grandmother laughing with that kind of joke!! You guys should have your own show, people who write reviews on Amazon.com who claim to be real people who are dead!! Anyway back to my review: <br /> <br />This is a really great live album. I got this when it first came out I believe it was May of 1987 and I thought it was great then (even on those dastardly old record players) and it still is great now. They have done an awesome job remastering this live album, I just wonder why they have done the same with Speak of the Devil and Live and Loud?
630521610X|5.0|I do! And this is one of my favorites! Scream is filled with horror, action, laughter , and fun all together. The opening scene is the scariest opening sequence I have ever scene. (here's a line from the movie.) \\" Whats your name?\\"  <br />\\"Why do you want to know my name?\\"  <br />\\"Because I want to know who I'm looking at.\\" <br />That was when the movie was getting scary. If you are reading this review and you haven't seen this movie,all I need to say is SEE IT!!! And for your own safety... DONT PICK UP THE PHONE!!!

0440180295|4.0|Vonnegut <br /> <br />Billy Pilgrim is a rather unremarkable guy.  A gawkish, unbrilliant optometrist that marries an overweight, unremarkable woman.  <br /> <br />There are two events in his life that set him apart, however.  In his 20's, he was among a handful of people who survived the firebombing of Dresden, in world war II; and he was the sole survivor of a plane crash when he was in later middle age. <br /> <br />Seeing so much death around him, Billy starts to lose his mind.  After the plane crash, he thinks that space aliens have abducted him, and take him to their planet to study.  His \\"aliens\\" have a different perception of time.  They are in the \\"fourth dimension\\", which means that they not only see an object in space, but they also \\"see\\" it in time.  They know the beginning and the end of all things, they see it in the same way we would see the color of someone's eyes.  From their perspective, there is no anguish in death, war, tragedy, destruction.  These things were, and are, and always will be.  They do not hold the illusion that we can act to change things. <br /> <br />So, the book begins by saying that Billy has become \\"unstuck in time\\".  His mental condition (shown in the storytelling) is such that he thinks that he is randomly transported from one point of his predetermined life to the next, with no ability to control it.  He has been so changed since being with the aliens, that he \\"knows\\" the hour and the means of his death.  Every moment in his life has been given back to him, without the gnawing sense of the unknown, and the anxiety that not knowing brings with it.  He no longer feels anguish over the thing not done, or the fear of what might happen.  All of these things are \\"written\\" already.  He becomes a mere traveller in his own skin.  In losing hope,  he has also lost fear. <br /> <br />Vonnegut's gift as a writer - gravity.  He writes in such a way that, no matter how foreign his subject might be, makes it sound not only believable, butalso familiar.  For example, when the main character is being taken to the prison camp in a train, the author describes the process of collecting prisoners, of the prisoners making room for themselves, standing, sleeping, and so on.  He makes the scene so clear, that I often felt that I had some personal understanding of the character's situation, as if I had been in that situation before!   Writing in such a clear way makes his characters responses more believable.

Get them both, you're never going to regret this decision.
6305508550|5.0|Office Space has quickly become one of those cult classics.  I cannot remember this movie even hitting theaters and I saw it after it was recommended by a friend.  I immediately went out and bought it after watching it once.  It is one of those movies that has classic lines and characters that you'll be quoting and referring too often.  Personally, I would rank this as one of the 10 funniest comedies I've ever seen.
B000069AUI|5.0|Not usually a mellow music fan, I picked up this album to see if I could find some surprises on here (i.e., fast songs with hooks). My first reaction to this album? \\"Boring!\\" But slowly, this band started pulling me in; it required a bit of effort and patience on my part. First, the hypnotic piano melody of \\"The Scientist\\" caught my interest (really, it is the easiest song of Coldplay's to like if you're not a habitual listener to downbeat material); then it was the heavenly beginning of \\"Clocks\\" that reminded me of all of the pivotal and moving points of great films (think of Julie Andrews spinning around on that big grassy field, arms above her head in joy, in \\"The Sound of Music\\"); then I regressed to songs off their previous album (\\"Trouble\\" and \\"Yellow\\"). I still wasn't quite a fan. That is, until one late night I started to listen to \\"Politik\\" and \\"In My Place.\\" I found myself addicted to the melodies that I hadn't realized were there; it suddenly hit me that Coldplay was, well, good. Next came my appreciation for \\"Don't Panic\\" and \\"Warning Sign.\\" I now understand that Coldplay is an acquired taste. Sure, they're popular and mainstream, but they're definitely not for everyone. And for many people, Coldplay might take some patience. For one thing, their songs tend to be mellow, slow, and, as some people have said, overbearing. It's fairly easy to dismiss this band if you have little time to sit down to really listen. If you prefer something you can dance to, look elsewhere. It took me months to become a fan of this album, which is filled with songs that have melodies that hit deeply to the core, an effect that is rare for many. Arguably, there are no real easy hooks that you hum along to as soon as you hear them. Rather, the songs gradually seep into your brain until you find yourself addicted to both the harmonies and the oftentimes enigmatic lyrics. For this reason, Coldplay shows signs of longevity, and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" shows signs of becoming aclassic.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|You might not agree with Pitchfork, but they got this one right. \\"Funeral\\" is easily the best album released this year, making it the best debut of '04 as well. The Arcade Fire do not make \\"emo,\\" but emotional music-- the essence of a concept that now drives an entire commercial division of the music industry. I bemoaned the loss of Built to Spill a few years ago, but now, several years later, The Arcade Fire emerges with quirky, grand orchestral rock that reminds us all of what music is mean to do-- make you feel. How the Arcade Fire can top \\"Funeral\\" is a question that many will ask in the months to come. Listen to the album, you won't regret it.
B00005MP58|4.0|The only other version that I saw was the Olivier/Garson version, which was (even by 1930s standards!) was pretty bad.  Garson & Olivier were both great actors, but even they could only do so much with the poor script and inept direction. <br /> <br />I loved this one.  I especially liked the music.  They used period pieces and (thank you!) period instruments, for the most part; when they put in original music, they made it 'in style.'  The main theme, for example, could easily pass as part of a Beethoven piano concerto. <br /> <br />Some people object to some of the actors being too old for the roles they played; that objection does not take into account the fact that people didn't live as long then as they do now.  A man of 28 was practically middle-aged; Darcy is a confirmed bachelor who finally gets netted.  No modern twentysomething could pull that off.  Similarly for the women.  With lifespans so short and childbirth so dangerous (not to mention such a high infant mortality rate) the only way to assure that there would be a next generation would be to have girls start to have babies as soon as they were capable of doing so, and to have as many as they could.  Hence, a single woman in her early twenties was considered an old maid; a modern girl couldn't pull that off.  They had to cast actors older than their characters. <br /> <br />There was in the early to mid 1990s a great spate of Jane Austen adaptations (and, if you count \\"Clueless\\", updatings.)  I can't claim to have seen all of them, but this is the best so far.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Man, this is a hard thing to review,e ven for a Betales fan like myself! And why?<br /><br />Well, in the first place, the live footage, the sound quality, the interviews, the performances in a lot fo TV shows and stadiums, etc are simply BREATHTAKING. The quality of the images and sound are marvellous, they obviousl spent a lof of time in the stuidos remastering theses things. It's a HUGE work, and the result was stupendous. A lot on previoulsy unseen footage, I assure you. Also, the documentary flows smootly, it's really enjoyable to watch, and I doubt if you will not drop a few tears at the end of disc four (Chapter Eight)... This alone deserves five stars, it's above anything else in the \\"band documentary\\" business...<br /><br />Now, let's talk about the content a little bit. That's where the problem is. The whole thing was produced by the BEatles themselves, adn they CLEARLY avoided tricky subjects. In a way, this was good, otherwise the documentary would seem like a bunch of gossip put together, or tocuhing wounds that were inflicted decades ago... Totally unecessary. However, things were a little too much superficial at times. It's clear that band members are avoiding to heart each other or say something wrong. There is no interview with the band's wives or girlfriends; no interview with famous \\"almost famous\\" drummer Pete Best; no real sense of the amazing deterioration in the band inter relationship before the break. The message the documentary passes is: \\"everything was alright, but things must change, we were all married, we had to split;\\" All Beatles fans know that this was not the truth. Paul, Ringo and George talk briefly about the \\"Yono Factor\\", and it's interesting to see how she really was present in EVERY rehearsal and recording that is shown in the documentary (after she met John, of course!)<br /><br />All of these \\"complains\\" are minimum flaws, in my opinion, or are not flaws at all! The BEatles recognize that they were playing worse, because nobdy could hear them; there is footage of George and Paul having a falling out (and that's how we can sse these guys really loevd each other - even when arguing, they mantain their class); they admit they used drugs (altough they Beatles never used drugs to the extend that some artists take, to the point of compromising their performances, their capacity to play, or wahtever).<br /><br />In the end, I must go for five stars. To have such an extended footage in your hand by such a low price it's a real gift.use nobdy could hear them; there is footage of George and Paul having a falling out (and that's how we can sse these guys really loevd each other - even when arguing, they mantain their class); they admit they used drugs (altough they Beatles never used drugs to the extend that some artists take, to the point of compromising their performances, their capacity to play, or wahtever). <br /> <br />In the end, I must go for five stars.

B0002I831S|3.0|I have to say that the packaging of this series is absolutely the worse I have ever seen in a series, or nearly so.  The distributor should be ashamed of this.  Loyal fans deserve better than a clamshell case that falls apart in their hands.  And take care that the tape holding the individual jewel cases together doesn't break.  What a bunch of crap    Note for Greg:  The color of the boxes has nothing to do with the color of the titles.  It has everything to do with the color of the tunics worn by the crew: Gold Tunics for Command staff, Blue Tunics for Sciences, and Red Tunics for Engineering and security crew.

B000001C6M|5.0|When Slayer's debut album Show No Mercy in 1983 (the same year Metallica'a Kill Em' All came out) it showed the beginning of great things that were yet to come. Taking their influences from Iron Maiden, Judas Priest to Motorhead to a new level of intensity, Slayer proved that they were here to stay, and this album was indeed proof. The album kicks off with the fast opener Evil Has No Boudaries which includes some really good riffs, fast drumming and of course singer/bassist Tom Araya's priceless high pitched scream in the beginning. The two next songs The Antichrist and Die By The Sword (which are both concert staples) show fast, amazing dueling leadwork by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King, while other great songs such as Fight Till Death, Metal Storm/Face The Slayer, and Black Magic continue the non stop thrash fest. Tormentor is very catchy and awesome as far as the dueling solos by King and Hanneman are concerned. All and all, a wonderful debut album from one of metal's absolute best. Buy it now. LONG LIVE SLAYER!!!!

B00005JNEI|5.0|Note: This DVD has not been released. I am reviewing the movie version, which does not include the extras on the DVD: <br /> <br />The right wingnuts have made a game of picking nits on this movie, but you'll notice that they never outright call Michael Moore a liar. \\"Misleading\\", perhaps. \\"Biased\\" perhaps. But every fact in Farenheit 9/11 was backed up with at least one, preferably more, mainstream media reports.  <br /> <br />Enough of the wingnuts. How's the movie? Well: <br /> <br />1. Flawed. Michael Moore throws a lot of stuff out onto the carpet that is suggestive, but doesn't go anywhere, like the stuff about the Saudi royals (\\"Bandar Bush\\", anybody?).  <br />2. Powerful. You will laugh. You will cry. If you saw it in the theater, you'll know what I'm talking about. I left at the end of the movie emotionally drained and mad as hell about George W. Bush and his misrule of America.  <br />3. Powerful. Did I mention that it's powerful? <br /> <br />In the end, despite this movie's well-publicized flaws, I have to call it what it is: A must-see experience, especially in this election season, where you need to see this movie even if you are a Bush supporter. Agree or disagree, it is an experience -- one that you will be less a person for skipping.

B0006419J6|4.0|This movie isn't a powerful piece of science-fiction and artificial intelligence, but it's definitely something you want to see. <br /> <br />Set in the 2030's, where Robots replace people and animals in menial labor, a troubled detective, Del Spooner (Will Smith) is paranoid that the new generation of robots, the NS-5 models (who will be as many as 20% of the population) will turn on humanity. How and when? He doesn't know. <br /> <br />When the inventor and writer of The Three Laws of Robotics (commonly referred to in Asimovian Robot Sci-Fi) and robotics itself and friend to Spooner is unexplicably killed, the detective thinks that this is the result of a specific Robot, who is comfortable being addressed by the name Sunny, and not his Model Number. <br /> <br />A series of events and action sequences lead up to a wonderful climax and twist in the plot, accompanied by good acting and wonderfully imaginative futuristic sets. Great but short comic relief insues along with wonderful thought provoking lines, such as an interrogation with Sunny, where Spooner says to him, \\"You do not dream. Dogs dream. Monkeys dream. People dream. But you, you, do not dream. You are not a living thing. Can a robot compose a symphony? Can a robot turn a blank canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?\\" And Sunny calmly replies, \\"Can you?\\" <br /> <br />This movie is great fun. Enjoy!

B0000AI44Q|4.0|It really has been a long strange trip from the 1960's to the present day.  Many of my contemporaries spent a fair amount of time in their youth in the long counter cultural Mari Gra of sex, drugs and rock and roll where we romped under the sun intoxicated with the new freedom we had.  In spite of the fact that we poured untold chemicals into our euphoria and shared body parts with friend and stranger alike, we fell in love with the idea of \\"going back to nature\\".  We became convinced that if the people of the world just left nature alone-letting nature take care of nature's problems-then earth's original balance would be restored.  If people would return to farm the land or hold lands like the noble gentry then we ourselves would be made whole.  History would not be kind to us.  Indeed, many a denizen of the fabled counterculture long has cut their hair, made their fortunes and have become respectable members of the Democratic or Republican parties.  Many of our parents and grandparents have gone so far as the deny the existence of their \\"wild days\\"-some even returning to houses of the God of Abraham and St Paul-places they had once spoke of in contempt.<br /><br />Well, not all of us.  A few have kept the faith through the years.  Older and grayer now, Neil Young stayed the course in being true to the verities of the Summer Of Love and true to himself.  His early support for Ronald Reagan threw many for a loop and as well his most recent song praising the fighting airline passengers of 911.  But in Neil's world all these things are consistent.  This is not to say much of Neil Young's thinking bears up well beneath scrutiny-but in the gospel according to AFTER THE GOLD RUSH they do.<br /><br />Young's latest offering is labeled a \\"musical novel\\" about a mythical community of Greendale.  It is tempting to compare Young's Greendale and his cast of characters with Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon and his hapless Norwegian Lutherans.  On the first few listenings Greendale seems to be a loose collection of stories that interweave with each other but do not as a whole tell one coherent narrative.  But on successive listenings a bare thread does appear.  This is Neil Young after all.  I doubt Young has any intention of continuing his \\"Greendale cycle\\" beyond this album-so what he has to say is pretty much all here.<br /><br />Without getting into too much detail, here is the jest of the story:  \\"Grandpa\\" is an independent sort who made his fortune in railroading and is now the beloved patriarch of the Green family and has a tendency to speak his mind.  (Grandpa resembles Young himself.  Part of the joke is Young is a part owner of a well-established toy train company.)  They live out on a ranch called the Double E.  The ranch used to be called the Double L until Grandpa changed it.  The name change gets many in the community angry (this seems implausible but it is a fact of life outside the teaming metropolises that some people in the countryside and small towns do get themselves worked up over matters that are none of their business).  Meanwhile Jed (grandson of Grandpa's brother) is stopped while running drugs.  In a split second impulse, Jed kills the policeman and is captured and arrested.  In the media frenzy that follows, news crews confront Grandpa and demand a statement from the family.  Grandpa thinks he owes them nothing and grabs a gun to run them off.  But as Grandpa tries to get the media to retreat off his land he suffers a fatal heart attack.  Sun Green, Grandpa's niece, drives up to deliver his supper only to come upon the tragedy.  This inspires Sun Green to chain herself to a large eagle statue at the offices of the power company demanding answers for their corrupt ways.  She implicates the White House which sends the FBI to hound her.  Sun Green meets Earth Brown at a party and they decide to move to Alaska to fight for the environment.<br /><br />There is more to the tale than this of course.  There are hints of terrorists planning their next attack on America.  There is the devil who pokes his nose here and there to set evil on the way.  All ending with an environmental anthem \\"Be The Rain\\" which seems to be about a lot of things-not the least of which is a hint of eco-terrorism.<br /><br />A fair observer may ask just how does a killing of a police officer during a drug bust lead to protests at the local power company and the nefarious black ops of the FBI.  The answer is that it makes no sense unless you accept Young's Manichean worldview of the forces of darkness versus the powers of light.  Whether you agree with it or not, the dualism of good honest folk against evil big corporations/big government/big media is the keel on which this story is built.  You also get the message that although Young ends on a note of hope he clearly feels the scales are tipped against the powers of light (or green in this case).<br /><br />\\"Well, Mr. Crabby.  What do you think of all this?\\"<br /><br />As a story the whole thing is ridiculous.  Young's worldview just doesn't correspond to the facts on the ground.  But you simply can't judge an album in terms of its worldview-if you did The Who's Tommy wouldn't fair well.  The more important question is how does this work as a work of art?  After all, Young's rosy vision of ancient Indian civilization and culture in \\"Cortez The Killer\\" exists only in legend and fantasy but its still a great song.<br /><br />Here is where things look up-for some of us.  The album is built on a few blues riffs that repeat and vary.  The overall result is an album seems to be one long song.  As it is several of the songs do clock in at over seven minutes each.  The lack of variety will put many people off.  But on their own the songs do pull you into the narrative.

There is the devil who pokes his nose here and there to set evil on the way.  All ending with an environmental anthem \\"Be The Rain\\" which seems to be about a lot of things-not the least of which is a hint of eco-terrorism. <br /> <br />A fair observer may ask just how does a killing of a police officer during a drug bust lead to protests at the local power company and the nefarious black ops of the FBI.  The answer is that it makes no sense unless you accept Young's Manichean worldview of the forces of darkness versus the powers of light.  Whether you agree with it or not, the dualism of good honest folk against evil big corporations/big government/big media is the keel on which this story is built.  You also get the message that although Young ends on a note of hope he clearly feels the scales are tipped against the powers of light (or green in this case). <br /> <br />\\"Well, Mr. Crabby.  What do you think of all this?\\"   <br /> <br />As a story the whole thing is ridiculous.  Young's worldview just doesn't correspond to the facts on the ground.  But you simply can't judge an album in terms of its worldview-if you did The Who's Tommy wouldn't fair well.    The more important question is how does this work as a work of art?  After all, Young's rosy vision of ancient Indian civilization and culture in \\"Cortez The Killer\\" exists only in legend and fantasy but its still a great song. <br /> <br />Here is where things look up-for some of us.  The album is built on a few blues riffs that repeat and vary.  The overall result is an album seems to be one long song.  As it is several of the songs do clock in at over seven minutes each.  The lack of variety will put many people off.  But on their own the songs do pull you into the narrative.  As I stated before the stories they tell seem to be only indirectly related to each other and so each song tends to standup by themselves.

B000002UDB|5.0|I don't understand why so many people don't like Magical Mystery Tour.  Was it simply because the movie had such bad press? Never mind the fact that it cannot be truly appreciated in the black-and-white format that BBC used when airing it on Christmas 1967.  But that is beside the point. <br /> <br />The point is that Magical Mystery Tour is one of the Beatles' best albums, up there with the likes of Rubber Soul, if you truly listen to it and don't mix your opinion of the album with all the horrible things that have been said of the movie.  I love Magical Mystery Tour because I see it as the best Beatles album for orchestra, along with Sgt. Pepper.  As a cellist three of my favorite tracks are Blue Jay Way, I Am the Walrus, and Strawberry Fields Forever.  I Am the Walrus sounds like the cello on acid- really!  It's the trippiest cello part, and I really want to learn the part on my cello when I have some time on my hands.  Blue Jay Way is like that too, it sounds like the cello is moaning.  I also really love the little solo thing we have in Strawberry Fields Forever, which even if I weren't a cellist I would say is an absolutely fantastic song, one of my favorites by the Beatles. <br /> <br />All You Need is Love is one of the most fun songs though.  I'm doing an arrangement for my school's jazz band, where I'm a bassist, and while it gets to be a pain in the neck having to transpose for all those parts all the time, I really love it and can't wait to play it at our first concert this month.  It's really fun to listen to, to see how all the parts harmonize, but even more fun to actually play. <br /> <br />Of course, two really great songs that don't have any strings in them are the Fool on the Hill and Penny Lane.  That weird trumpet in Penny Lane- I think it's a soprano trumpet- has such a great sound.  The song in and of itself is such an upbeat, cheery song, the kind you listen to when you have a bad day and it perks you right up.  The Fool on the Hill has the prettiest flute part in it, and overall it's the most beautiful song.  The part in the movie where Paul is standing on the hill singing is so brilliant.  I remember reading somewhere once that Fool is Yoko Ono's favorite Beatles song. <br /> <br />Well, those aren't all the great songs on the album, but they're some of the highlights. If you had me go through every song, this review would go on forever.  I simply love Magical Mystery Tour...it is certainly more than a collection of great singles!

0446677450|2.0|I don't know how many \\"Rich Dad\\" books Kiyosaki has published now, but after reading three different books, I have to tell you to look elsewhere for a substantive resource about real estate investing. Read the first one perhaps to hear his message (again and again and again) but you'll get tired of his redundant cliches. I truly believe his REAL path to wealth is writing about the current trend away from stocks and mutual funds into real estate. There's a huge population of people who are leary of Wall Street, and many of them are looking for a \\"real estate investing for dummies\\" type of book -- something that condenses a complex and risky industry into \\"simple-speak.\\" But he just doesn't deliver. With each new book he continues to repeat the same message from the last without providing details. But as long as he keeps publishing and people keep buying, he keeps getting richer. <br /> <br />Read his first book if it's at the library, but then look elsewhere if you want to find out what you need to do to invest in real estate. Kiyosaki won't tell you how. He'll just continue to promise you he'll tell you how -- if you read his next book...or take his seminars...or play his game, etc.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I'm very happy to have in my hands, at last!!!!, the best trilogy created ever!!!!.  there's a lot of sruprises in this box set, bonus materials, trailers, tv spots, photo galleries, plus the new scenes added like in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, where Vader talks to the emperor new image and more dialogue, just for put one example. <br /> <br />You wont regret to buy this trilogy, because it's a classic that it worth to watch it over and over again, you'll never get tired of them because are classics that will remains forever in our lives.  MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002WU9|5.0|Yeah, we're talking about the Chef here. 1995, along with \\"Liquid Swords\\", two of the greatest hip hop albums ever. \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" will beat your ass. What makes this album so good? It's classic, for one.  \\"Knuckleheadz\\" is sick. Awesome classical WU beat, clumsy bass line, awesome beat, and some Charlie Brown piano. Everyone kills it, especially U-God. His flow on this one shows he's got enough to run with the rest of the bees. \\"Guillotine (Swords)\\" is THE best track on here. Sick beat, and my favorite clan members(Rebel INS, Rae, Ghost, GZA). I mean, \\"Poisionous paragraphs smash your phonograph in half, its be inspectah deck on the warpath\\". SCIENCE.  Oh yeah, if you didn't already know, Ghostface is all over the album, which already gives it 4 stars. Still makes me wish Ghost and Rae still recorded. \\"Pretty Toney\\" would be classic as hell if it had ANY of the chef (still pretty good, though. damn good).   \\"Ice Water\\" is still probably the most insane (...) on here. (...)I mean, damm, that beat. How can anyone call this weak? It's mafioso as hell. Probably the least commercial beat on here. And Cappadonna's verse might be one of the best I've heard on a Wu CD. Yes. I'm not even playing around. He destroys it.  \\"Wu-Gambinos\\" saves some of the best for last. Featuring more of the drunken-mumbly RZA flow I've loved for a while now. I'll always feel people overlook the RZA when it comes to his flow. I thought it was pretty genius on 36 Chambers, but then I heard him on \\"4th Chamber\\" and I was left dumb. It's more of the same here, a million words spilling all over the beat. By this point, RZA became an emcee's emcee. Bobby Steels for presdient. If he wouldn't have become so lazy (and he did, admit it), he could have overtaken the whole hip-hop game. Having Masta Killa follow him up is overkill. Two overly compentent MC's releasing the plague everwhere. Meth also drops one of his best verses ever.    I'm overlooking a lot. I'm cutting this one short. If youneed to be told why you should buy this, I'm not sure if you should buy it anyways. This is the original \\"mafioso\\" NYC hip-hop work. Nothing. NOTHING has come close to it. \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" should have stopped 50 Cent and all his spawn from overrunning the pop culture. I'd say with \\"Liquid Swords\\" and \\"Ironman\\", this shows the pinnacle of the Wu. The GREATEST hip-hop clan ever.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This is easily the best movie I've seen all year. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) pick up where they left off a little under ten years ago in \\"Before Sunrise\\"--he's in Paris to promote his book, which just so happens to be about his encounter with Celine all those years ago, and she shows up at the book signing. They then wander the streets of Paris together, and the conversation flows as easily as it did back then. After all those years, there's still such chemistry and connection between them, and in the end, that's what the film is about--how often do we meet people that we truly connect with? The film is basically one long, involving, wonderfully interesting conversation, so if you love gigantic Hollywood action packed sequences, this might not be right for you. However, if you're looking for something introspective and intelligent and peppered with asides about what it means to live a meaningful life, then this is the one for you.    I found \\"Before Sunset\\" to be just as romantic as \\"Before Sunrise\\" and they don't even share one kiss. The ending was wonderful, to me. I would highly recommend this one!
068987474X|1.0|Why is everything always about women trying to figure the dudes out?   Why couldn't the title be - He doesn't understand that I rule!  instead of something that sounds like a slam!  I believe this book prey's on women's insecurities.   Good for the writers.  They won't have a desk job any time soon.  Because I have heard this book is selling like hot cakes.  Everyone wants answers.  There are as many answers as there are people.  I say, put the book down and get out and try it for yourself!!! <br /> <br /> <br />I hate every thing this book stands for!!! <br /> <br />
B0001HAISG|4.0|This first thing that I realized about this movie was that had I been a child when I watched it, I would have thought it to be one of the greatest movies ever.  However, I'm a few years removed from being a child and I found this movie to be average entertainment for adults.  I'll give it four stars for the fact that if I were ten, I'd give it five stars, but I'm almost thirty, and that part of me says to give it three stars.<br /><br />The visuals in this film are beautiful.  I've seen few imaginary worlds depicted on film as magical as Neverland.  It is breathtaking at times.  The clouds, the pirate ship, and even the crocodile turn this movie into one big children's dream.  The costumes were nice as well.  The special effects were iffy at times, but for a youngster, they were perfect.  The swordplay in the film hearkened back to the days of Errol Flynn's \\"Robin Hood.\\"<br /><br />The acting, lead by the grand performances of Jason Isaacs(Capt. Hook/Mr. Darling) and Rachel Hurd-Wood(Wendy), was above average.  As Hook, Isaacs was downright evil to not only the Lost Boys and the Darlings, but to his own crew as well.  Hurd-Wood had everything going for her as the strong-minded and adventurous Wendy.  Jeremy Sumpter had the look of young Peter Pan, but his acting was a little wooden at times.  Lynn Redgrave gave a solid performance in the small role of Aunt Millicent, and Olivia Williams was good as Mrs. Darling.  Perhaps the most standout performance of them all was the lovely Ludivine Sagnier.  As Tinkerbell, she obviously had the most playful part in the movie.  Her face was like rubber, full of twisted and funny faces.  Her jealousy of Wendy was played out almost to a cruel level, making her one of the hardest characters to pull for, but she loved Peter so dearly that you really wanted to cheer her on.  The rest of the cast did a superb job.<br /><br />As you probably know, Peter Pan is the boy who wants to stay young forever.  Hook is his arch-enemy who has a croc on his tail.  It loved the taste of his hand so much, that it wants to sample the rest of his body as well. The lost boys just want a mother with none of the attachments.  In other words, they just want someone to love them when they are hurt or scared, and tell them a good story once in awhile.  Wendy wants adventure, but also the security of home.<br /><br />In closing, if you have young children(ages 5-13), they'll probably enjoy this movie for its swashbuckling adventure and wonderful story.  Older kids will most likely avoid this one.  Adults will find it nice to think back to the days when they were a kid and wished that they too, could be young forever.s a croc on his tail.

B0001I561E|5.0|The Aladdin movie is loosely based on a story in the book \\"The Arabian Nights: Tales from a Thousand and One Nights\\". Aladdin is a  street rat that must live by his wits. He seems mostly like a good person that is lowered to being a thief to eat. More of a Robin Hood thief, he gives away more than he takes. When he meets Princess Jasmine his life is changed forever. His love for her makes him desire changing his life even more than before and it motivates him to find the treasure that will make him a Prince. There is only one problem, an evil Grand Vizier by the name of Jafar and his pet parrot Lago want the treasure as well. Fortunately Aladdin has his monkey Abu and Jasmine to help him. Don't miss how they beat Jafar and Lago.<br /><br />My whole family was excited to get this DVD. Don't wait to get it yourself since Disney is still putting them in the vault for about eight years after they have sold the set number of copies. I don't think this one will last on the shelves that long since it is a wonderful story of adventure and romance. The incredible bright colored animation and music are definitely high points. The comedy of Robin Williams as the Genie is over the top. When you start looking at all the features of this two disc platinum set you will realize this is a wonderful gift to your family or someone elses. This is one of the best of all the Disney classics. Most people that enjoyed \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"The Lion King\\" will want to add this to their DVD collection.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|In this era of \\"reality\\" TV and pop documentaries it's refreshing to see  a no spin political documentary that basks in it's truth rather than manipululates it. Robert McNamara becomes a rarity in Washington by candidly reflecting on his mistakes and triumphs as Secretary of Defense under both Kennedy and Johnson. He does this because he feels that he has something to teach us, our administration , as well as future administrations about war and politics. It's an incredibly important documentary and should be required viewing for anybody taking office.  <br />This emotion impact of this film is surprising. Credit goes to both McNamara and Errol Morris who takes such a complex subject and simplifying it both visually and emotionally; by the end of the film you'll want to give McNamara another shot at redemption.
0393035158|5.0|Fantastic book that asks questions we should all be asking.  Well, I guess you can ask them, but be prepared there are less tolerant of us who would smite thee with stone for doing so.  Yeah, we really need to ditch these stories and myths and go with what got us here.  Science is improving our daily lives and ethics, which underwrites all religions, is the way to go.  Hold the door open for the little old lady at the mall because it is the right thing to do, not because it will get you one more poker chip into heaven.  The reason you and I will live into our late 70s as opposed to dying in our late 40s, as happened at the beginning of the 20th century, is because of antibiotics, not because we pray harder now or live more moral lives.  We live longer because of progress made by science which observes and tests hypothesis in the physical universe and through such research, we have all benefitted.  But now it is much easier to wreck havok and mass death by flying planes into buildings or suicide bombing buses and public venues all in the name of God, or my story is better than your story.  No one knows what exists beyond life, but how does one rationalize with someone convinced the hereafter is better than the here and now and their hand is on the trigger of a nuclear bomb?  You can't and we need to come to terms with this reality and how it threatens our future.  The founding fathers in their wisdom made this a secular nation.  Our current president has admitted on several occasions to having \\"dialogues with God.\\"  I wish he had had a dialogue with his own father rather than the Holy Father before invading Iraq because thy own father would have asked the most pertinent question, \\"Have you got an exit strategy?\\"  Sam Harris has really done us a favor by writing this book.  I'm in my 40s and we all remember the advice Dustin Hoffman received in The Graduate, \\"plastics.\\"  It's too late for me since I'm not going back to school, but here's the new frontier to go west, young man - brain science.  All those synapses and neurotransmitters will explain our thoughts, motivations, and behavior far better than exorcising demons by a drilling a hole in someone's head to let the evil out.  We've progressed 2,000 years.  Let's begin to act like it.
B00062IDCO|4.0|This was a damn fine season, the final one. <br /> <br />We saw the characters Paris and Torres get married - Torres becomes pregnant. <br /> <br />It seems that Seven of Nine will die, when her 'cortical node' malfunctions, in a sequel to an earlier episode. <br /> <br />We meet Klingons who've been lost in the Delta Quantrant for many, many years (their ancestors before them) and don't know of any treaty between Klingons and Humans. <br /> <br />I thought, when this season was new, that there would be an on-going storyline throughout this season referring to just how the Voyager crew get home.  But that's not what happened -- it was all the last episode. <br /> <br />That episode was called \\"End Game\\" - which I might buy this box set just for the episode.  The episode starts out about 20 years into the future.  It's been ten years since Voyager ended it's 16-year voyage home, where too many members of the crew were killed.  The captain (now an Admiral) makes a decision to purchase an illegal weapon, along with state-of-the-art shields, and make a voyage to the past -- to bring Voyager home much earlier than the original 16 years.  Many argued (including myself) that there should have been a few extra scenes at the end of the episode, but oh well. <br /> <br />This box set comes out 4 days before Christmas, just in time for all those Voyager lovers, huh?
B0002VKZL6|1.0|Why does the best guitar player in the world and one of the worst vocalists continue to produce this kind of drivel?  This guy could produce the all time best instrumental guitar album if he wanted to but instead we get this kind of junk.  There aren't even enough break out guitar riffs to justify listening to this thing twice.  I put my copy of Shagri La in the trash. <br />The reviewer who called this a 'Rocking' album must not have listened to it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is so great that I: a usually very right-wing person, also loves it. Sure, I'm into Classic Rock now, but I've loved Green Day my whole life. They're still my number one band. This is the greatest thing to come out since, well, 1994(Dookie). And before that the early eighties. <br /> <br />It's freakin' amazing. Get it. Now.

B0002KQNJU|3.0|My review here is for the DVD and not for the movie, which I think is masterful. <br /> <br />Polanski's \\"Vampire Killers\\" is one of the greatest horror spoofs ever made. Extremely atmospheric and beautifully realized. This much anticipated DVD release of the film, however, should have been much, much better. The film itself is sharp, but the colors are muddy. The previous MGM/UA laserdisc of this title looked good, and I was expecting at least the same degree of quality. I suppose the film must have further deteriorated in the last decade, because many of the shots in this DVD have a bluish tint to them. The main titles flow over a close-up image of the (gray) moon, and look way too dark and blue on this DVD. I've seen this film theatrically (as well as previous video versions) and it looks muddy here. The soundtrack is decent, and not surprisingly, in mono, as released, but even that sounds flatter here then in previous versions. Komeda's lovely score sounds a bit compressed. <br /> <br />As for the bonus material, it's not bad. There is a corny promo for the film, which is silly, but nice to have. The theatrical trailer also looks in good shape. However, the alternate animated opening to the film, which was available on the older laserdisc, is NOT HERE, and that, I find unexcusable. <br /> <br />Overall, a so-so DVD release of a classic film. Hopefully a better release will await in the future. <br />
B00005JMJG|5.0|Written by Charlie Kaufman (writer of the wonderfully bizarre \\"Being John Malkovich\\") and directed by Michel Gondry (director of many of Bjork's amazingly inventive videos), I knew I would like \\"Eternal Sunshine\\". I expected it to be clever, interesting and fun. What I didn't expect was that it would turn out to be such a touching and poignant love story as well. I'm not a big fan of Jim Carrey, but he does very well here, going against type to play a subdued character who constantly refers to himself as \\"not that interesting\\". It's actually the luminous Kate Winslet (still radiantly gorgeous, even with blue hair) who plays the zany, unpredictable one, who Jim Carrey's character is drawn to, like a moth to a flame. The story has a slight sci-fi premise to it, with the two main characters trying to erase their memories of one another and their tumultuous relationship, but this film is really about love, relationships, fate and forgiveness. Aside from the love story involving the lead characters, there's also an interesting subplot involving the employees of the \\"memory erasing\\" agency, with Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood all giving terrific supporting performances. All in all, a terrific film.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|This album is terrible their are some highlights but overall it couldve been much worse. \\"Pretty fly\\"is anawful song and \\"why cant you get a job?\\" is a not so subtle ripoff. Overall this fits in with all the blink 182, simple plan, good charlotte garbage.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Times and technology have changed. The new Star Wars adds both positive and negative elements to the film, depending on your level of devotion of course. Regardless, it is a NEW Star Wars. The visual quality has improved by leaps, and the audio effects by bounds, although one of the TIE Fighters in A New Hope still has the pasted rectangle artifacts around it from the original film (lazy editors). The 5.1 is breathtaking, and the new scenes are intriguing. They really should release the original films on DVD, but then the remastering will be kind of pointless as people who would buy it will simply want the \\"original\\" film. Hey Lucasfilm, just go out and put the analog films through a A/D filter and slap on a price tag. Scores of original fanatics will be happy and you won't get anymore flak, considering they are asking for the OG version they won't care about remastered quality. <br /> <br />Personally, I am a Star Wars fantic, and I frankly enjoy ANY new SW material, so I say bring it on! These dvds are brilliant. If you have issues, watch the OG VHS releases (or beta for that!).
B0000E2FLC|5.0|for those of you who want a good video, of a mid-aged AC/DC this is a great video.  It has all the essentials and is reasonably priced.  Well filmed video with a good crowd, nothing to complain about.  Some good stage props that add a little something to the video.  Buy the video, for the price u cant go wrong.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Truly impressive  sound and the production was crystal clear as well...Not even a bit dissapointing. All the songs are original and has great lirycs too.

I recommend anything else by her and to purchase her new album ESCUCHA ATENTO and Hlne Segara and Laura's collaboration \\"On n'oublie jamais rien, on vit avec.\\"
B00003CXCT|1.0|Plain and simple:  this box set should have included BOTH the classic AND the new and \\"improved\\" version of each film.   <br /> <br />Lucas has every right to tinker with and add to his films - BUT he also should have had the decency to respect the historical legacy of the Star Wars films, not to mention the desires of Star Wars fans.  Anyone with the slightest bit of forsight or common sense would have recognized that to release these films adulterated with new material would be hurtful to a large number of fans.  And any director/producer with the slightest bit of integrity would have respected the artistic value of the original versions. <br /> <br />A simple compromise should have been made: release both versions on the DVD set. <br /> <br />Personally, I will hang on to my laserdiscs (which contain the original versions) and buy the \\"new and improved\\" DVDs if (and only if) I find a used copy on the discount rack. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Regardless of your opinions of the current administration or your voting record, everyone should see this movie.  This film addresses issues that no other media has had the guts to touch.
B00005JNEI|5.0|The film is not really a comedy. It is much too grim for that, but it is an extremely powerful document. It is much more low-key than his previous films. Michael Moore himself hardly appears. 90% of the film is archive footage! When he appears, he is listening to the the mother ho is at first a proud patriot, and then just a grieveing mother who has lost her son. In this film, Moore just listens, and observes, he is not playing an active part, very much. That makes it so powerful: Moore can be refuted, archive footage cannot. <br />We are not only treated to the film, but also to Ms. Rice's senate \\"testimony\\". That's the only feature I have watched so far. That farce was absolutely amazing. Ms. Rice doing damnedest to appear sweet and vulnerable, while desperately stalling for time. <br />The film. I fail to see the treason and libel in it. My most enduring images from the film are when black representatives beg an uncaring senate for an investigation into the Florida \\"election\\"-procedure, and when Bush is just sitting after being told about the attacks. Is that really the action of a determined, strong president? Waiting for Dick or Karl to tell him what to do? The White House has never come up with an explanation for that, any explanation. <br />I wish Mr. Moore could have included the first presidential debate, and Powell's presentation to the UN as features. The adminsitration should not be allowed to forget those jokes.  <br />We saw in the presidential debate how well Bush functions without a babysitter.
B000002VJH|5.0|This is the result of the Grateful Dead playing shows for 10 solid years and perfecting their songcraft with the help of other musicians, themselves, and the otherly world of creative process.  This is a Master's Thesis of music, the greatest album the Dead ever recorded.  It has the power of a tremendous live show juxtaposed with the fragility of flower petals.  The intimacy that weaves through the songs is the big surprise and you may find that the relaxed mellow with surge into a huge amount of energy while listening.  You'll dance in the dark.  This is the Dead's smoothest, most exciting and powerful studio recording ever.   <br /> <br />Get it for the songs.  Keep it for how it will grow with you for a long, long time. <br /> <br />This is the CD for the deadhead who has peace with their old, useless, and passive listening style and seeks true artistic beauty to dance in their brain. <br /> <br />  Unusual Occurrences in the Desert indeed....
B00002ND77|5.0|In spite of the scant attention that Hollywood has paid to Spike Lee's \\"Malcolm X,\\" there can be no denying that it was one of the decade's best films, right up there with \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" The cast is marvelous, the writing is superb, the music is intoxicating and the cinematography is downright unbelievable. Without a doubt, this is Spike Lee's greatest film, and one for which he truly deserved more acclaim than he ever recieved. But Hollywood is a place where you have to get in line if you want to succeed, and Spike's buck-the-system political outlook has always made things difficult for him in Tinseltown. There is something about Lee's public persona that makes whites uneasy, and no place is whiter than the Hollywood backlot.  <br /> <br />But back to Malcolm X. If this is Lee's best film, its also Denzel Washington's. Sure, he made us wince in \\"Training Day,\\" but the challenge here is a much greater one. Here, Denzel has to portray a well-known figure who has mostly been reduced to a stereotype. His job is to break through that stereotype, while still providing us with a realistic look at Malcolm the man. I would say that Denzel pulls that off remarkably well.  <br /> <br />In part, he's able to do that because of the writing. Certainly, some of the autobiography has been compressed for dramatic purposes, but the spirit of the work dominates the film. In spite of all the quibbling and hair-splitting one could do over the minor details, the fact remains that the movie is highly faithful to Malcolm's life and work. Perhaps the biggest revision is the character of Baines, wonderfully portrayed by Albert Hall. Baines is an amalgamation of several characters in the autobiography, including Malcolm's brother Reginald, and without him the film would fall apart. This is clearly one of those instances where the writers do an excellent job of changing the facts in order to tell the truth.  <br /> <br />Denzel and Hall aren't the only oneswho turn out excellent performances. For many audiences, this was their first glimpse of Angela Basset, the dark-skinned beauty who plays Betty Shabazz, as well as Delroy Lindo, who has made a career out of playing unsavory characters. His portrayal of West Indian Archie is as intimidating as it is engrossing. He clearly comes across as someone you would not want to cross paths with.  <br /> <br />As for the DVD itself , one wishes there were more features, such as a director's commentary or perhaps a documentary on the making of the film. I imagine that the movie will eventually be digitally remastered, with 16-bit image processing, THX sound and all of that, but there is no telling when that will happen. Perhaps when it does, Spike Lee and Denzel Washington will be kind enough to sit down and cut a commentary track. In the meantime we'll just have to make do with what we've got. But with a film as good as this one, there's little room for complaint.
B00005JMEW|5.0|<br />  This movie has style all over it.  Quentin painted it on in this \\"tribute\\" to genre cinema.  I love this movie...the gobs of violence, the \\"plot\\"... you know--everything.  Honestly though, Quentin Tarantino doesn't seem like the most competent crayon in the toolshed.  The man seems like...kind of a moron whenever he is interviewed or looked at.  That doesn't mean he can't make great movies though, and this is one of those.  His other movies are great too, but this and Pulp Fiction are definately his best.  Does he have anything else up his sleeve?  I don't know...I don't even know why I would ask myself that question.   <br /> <br />  This movie centers around a woman who is seeking revenge on those who killed her baby and shot her in the head.  Four years and one coma later, she awakes to a shabby trucker who wants to do the old in-out with her.  She escapes that hospital in trademark Quentin gore and chases down those who have wronged her.  The rest is pretty much her getting a sword and shoving it through people.  There is this really cool animated sequence that idiots wonder \\"why it's even in there.\\" <br /> <br />  I suggest this to anyone...especially sword owners and dismemberment enthusiasts.  And anyone with an Uma-crush...ooooooo....
B00005JL3A|4.0|This movie was great. I DO play video games, so I may be biased, but no completely. This is the only video-game turned-movie that i like. Final Fantasy was not good. Acting was good. Reason for my 4-star rating was because the script could have been done better. I say this because I don't remember hearing or knowing that the main character's name was Alice until the end credits. <br /> <br />By the way in response to  Mr. Robbin's review, he said: <br />  \\"Except for one part, Milla, your no Jackie Chan, so that kick move off the wall, w/o the explanation presented in the second movie, was just uncalled for; a little too over the top.\\"  <br /> <br />I have to disagree because during that scene, at first she doesn't know how she does it, but she remembers the captain telling her (due to amnesia) that she's  highly trained operative to guard the mansion. <br />
B00007KWHN|4.0|Many prog rock bands had to take two or three albums to get it right. You had Genesis start off with the cheesy pop debut of From Genesis to Revelation, then their first truly prog offering with Trespass, then they really got it right with Nursery Cryme (by which their best lineup of Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, Collins, and Hackett was finally realized). Jethro Tull took four or five albums to make the transition from the blues to prog (from This Was to Aqualung or Thick as a Brick). And of course, Yes was no exception, having already released two albums in 1969 and 1970 which, while still excellent albums, was the band in search of a sound. And they finally found that sound with The Yes Album. Note that I didn't mention King Crimson or ELP since they got it right the first time. <br /> <br />The Yes Album was Yes' do or die album for Atlantic Records. If this album went the way of Time and a Word or their self-entitled 1969 debut, Atlantic would have dropped them. The band obviously benefitted by the replacement of guitarist Peter Banks (who would later form Flash, in which Tony Kaye would be temporarily a member of for their 1972 debut) with Steve Howe who was a more versital musician, who played both electric and acoustic, not to mention other stringed-instruments (like mandolins or a sitar-guitar hybrid, which he wouldn't use until starting with Close to the Edge). Banks, on the other hand seemed to prefer just the electric guitar. What really kept the band from being dropped by Atlantic was the amount of FM radio airplay this album received, as \\"Starship Trooper\\" and \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" prove. The compositions were much more extended and progressive, with Tony Kaye allowed to give us more great organ work. In the background, he also used a Moog, but he was pretty much reluctant to play any other keyboard than the Hammond organ (that's why he got replaced by Rick Wakeman later the same year, 1971). \\"Yours is No Disgrace\\" is the opener, which shows the band doing something much more progressive than anything they did before. Kaye gives us some wonderful, distorted organ, with some great guitar work from Howe. Yes' trademark vocals are here, of course. The song goes through some rather lengthy solos as well. As you expect from Jon Anderson, the lyrics don't seem to make much sense. The next piece is Steve Howe's piece, called \\"Clap\\", which is basically an all-acoustic piece. It was also recorded live. \\"Starship Trooper\\" is one of the album's prog epics that the FM dial had no problem playing in its entirety. \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" is a rather light-hearted acoustic number. Recorders were provided by Colin Goldring, a member of a prog rock band called Gnidrolog (who in 1971 had no albums released yet - that band also featured future Steeleye Span drummer Nigel Pegrum). Steve Howe played mandolin. The song gets heavier as it goes on, when the electric guitar kicks in. \\"Venture\\" is a short piece with that classic Yes sound, but not the most radio friendly piece. Then you get \\"Perpetual Change\\", another one of those prog pieces that go through several movements. <br /> <br />The only real reason I didn't give this album the full five star rating is I felt the music was a bit lacking in the maturity department. But given where the band was at, at this point, even better things were to come with their next two releases.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|When a film about World War II has American audiences routing for the Germans, hoping and cheering them on for the success of their mission, one can only become conscious of the ultimate horror and futility of war. One also has watched a helluva movie.  <br /> <br />Back in the early 80's I called in sick (along with some friends) to see the opening of Petersen's Das Boot. We were all stunned. Went out for a beer and then returned to the theatre and watched it all over again.  <br /> <br />Petersen masterfully developed his cast into a crew who are no longer \\"the enemy\\" but fresh faced kids, neither prepared nor aware of the horror that was waiting them. When I first saw \\"Das Boot\\" - I was the same age as those kids so it resonated more powerfully than I could have possibly imagined. In this wonderful uncut release of the original German miniseries we're forced to spend even more time with the crew of U-96 and in that time get to knew them better. We see friendships and bonds formed, the irritability that comes with lack of privacy and tension so dense it becomes an almost physical presence. We also get more of the sense of what war really is - immense spans of boredom and ennui interrupted by the occasional horrors of violence and death.  <br /> <br />Petersen kept his cast indoors and unshaven during the entire shoot with the resulting effect that the crew actually looks like a group of men who have not seen natural light, or breathed fresh air for 65 days. Additionally, the actors were all put through vigorous physical training so that when racing through the set of a dangerously reconstructed U-Boat, they move naturally with an almost balletic swiftness that is dazzling.  <br /> <br />This is masterful filmmaking of the highest order, with sound and lighting that capture the claustrophobic nature of a submarine, almost suffocating the viewer. The scenes of Das Boot racing through the Atlantic, it's difficult near fatal destruction in the narrow Strait of Gibraltar will have your blood pumping at fever pitch. <br /> <br />The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent, each actor - even ones with little to no dialogue, making bold indelible choices in developing their characters.  <br /> <br />Jrgen Prochnow as the Captain gives a remarkable, strong performance, making one believe - from the very beginning - this is a true leader of men. You have no difficulty beliving this crew standing behind this captain's every decision.  <br /> <br />Petersen's writing of Herbert Grnemeyer as the eager young reporter, Werner is a masterful creation. Werner becomes the multi-faceted prism through whom we watch and live this story. Part Greek chorus, part conscience of the uninvolved, we join him as an outsider on the inside, becoming participants in this heart rending drama. Grnemeyer's performance becomes the very soul of Das Boot. <br /> <br />\\"Das Boot\\" remains one of my all time favorite films and to finally be able to own and see it as Wolfgang Petersen intended is one of the best things to happen since the invention of DVD.

0553582445|4.0|As mentioned repeatedly, Fool's Errand begins the 'Tawny Man,' a sequel trilogy to Robin Hobb's 'Farseer' series.  I've just begun the new series, so I'm only going to talk about the first volume. <br /> <br />You don't need to read the first trilogy before you start the second, but it does add enormously to the emotional resonance.  You also don't need to read the Live Ship Traders trilogy, set in the same world with different characters.  I gather that there's some connection, but I haven't read it and so far I don't feel like I'm missing much. <br /> <br />The story is in first-person, with the main character (FitzChivalry Farseer) telling his own story.  Robin Hobb's writing is evocative and picturesque.  She seamlessly blends Fitz's perceptions of the world around him with his responses to it.  Fitz is a complex character, with memories, emotions, and sensations constantly weaving through his thoughts. It's hard not to be pulled in by his tangled psyche as you sympathize and want to shake him by turns.  Fitz is a really good, personable guy...but he's definitely got his issues.  If you've read the first series, you know they're warranted.  I find his most admirable quality is that he forges on and does what he needs to, no matter what his internal landscape looks like. <br /> <br />In fact, all the characters are very believable.  Each of them possesses a unique, realistic personality with their own merits and flaws.  They're people you could meet in your own life, put in desperate situations that bring out the best and worst in them.  Even the animals are shaped with their little ways and idiosyncracies.  The Fool, especially, is a vibrant, living character.  Out of everyone in the book, he's the one that Fitz is closest to, and their interactions sparkle like jewels scattered through the text.  I found myself practically skimming some through sections of the book, just to get to the next part where the two of them talk. <br /> <br />Which leads me to the nextpoint.  I gave the book four stars  because while Robin Hobb is an excellent writer, she's not a great one.  She can get repetetive about plot points.  Sometimes you feel a bit like she's bashing you over the head with them lest you somehow miss one.  And I think she occasionally tries *too* hard with Fitz--there are times when she pushes his emotional reactions so hard that I feel embarrassed for him, like he's making a public spectacle of himself. <br /> <br />But on the whole, this is a wonderful book.  I stayed up till 4 am two nights running, and spent Sunday trying to do housework one-handed while I read.   <br /> <br />I leave one final caution:  the Farseer trilogy was spectacular up till the final book, and then everything sort of crammed together and got melodramatic.  It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't as strong as the rest of the series (I would give Assassion's Fate 3 stars, while the rest of the trilogy was 4 bordering on 5).  I'm not certain whether she's overcome that problem with this new effort.  So if you're a reader who puts a lot of weight on endings, you may want to keep that in mind.

B0002858YS|1.0|seriously, i'm having a difficult time understanding why anyone would rave about this band. i feel ashamed for having \\"stumbled\\" across the killers; it's like my taste radar must have been turned off that day. i read all these reviews that toss out words like \\"retro\\" \\"glam rock\\" \\"awesome\\" - but don't be suckered in to believing them. this is trivial music. as it says in the main review, somehow, some jerk attends an oasis concert and gets \\"inspired\\" and the killers is a result. i've been to many concerts that inspired me but i didn't take it upon myself to torture the world with my lack of musical ability. and any suggestion that this is an ode to something past is just grasping for something to connect to, because it's impossible to connect to this music. if it's retro or glam rock or something that builds on a music idea in the past that you're looking for, revisit teenage fanclub's album bandwagonesque. and here's where we are - reading recommendations by 13 year olds who totally know what's hot today but have no clue how it fits into a musical context. even granting that, this album doesn't even stand up OUT of context, hearing it through ears that have heard no other music. if stranded on a desert island, and the only music on earth was the killers, i'd choose silence.
0375422889|3.0|DON'T READ THIS BOOK (Story of a Return) UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY READ THE FIRST PERSEPOLIS (Story of a Childhood).  It's important to bond with the child Marjane and to understand where the characters are coming from before heading into this book.  Also, the first one is essentially perfect, which can be said about so few books.  <br />  <br />/*SPOILERS BELOW*/ <br />The Story of a Return provides insight into modern Iranian culture, the effects of the Iraq-Iran war, and the differences between the West and Iran as Marjane repeatedly integrates herself into an unfamiliar land.  (Iran may be home, but it's strange to her when she returns.)  We also witness the slurs and descrimination she endures as a Middle Easterner in Europe, and it induces brings a deep sense of horror in the reader on Marjane's behalf.    <br /> <br />Some find the second book equal to the first.  I disagree.  It is no fault of the author's; she applies equal skill and talent to both books.  The material is fundamentally different.  The Story of a Childhood has a child's and pre-teen's whimsy flowing through it, and the characters are still relatively innocent and opimistic despite the path of the country.  In The Story of a Return, the author tries to include some of the imaginings that brought such a charming whimsy to her first memoir, but it is harder with an older main character.  The humor has to come from elsewhere, and is therefore harder to find.  Her experiences seem harsher to the reader, since she is experiencing them directly, instead of the close calls or indirect experiences of the first Persepolis.  And because Marjane is older, we become more judgemental of her mistakes, which also darkens the tone of the book.   <br /> <br />Well worth reading, but one feels a sense of loss when comparing it to the first.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|this cd is just ridiculous. the vocals alone could make a platinum cd. combined wit insane screaming, guitar that blends so many different styles u get confused, and drums that are perfectly syncopated and synchronized with everything else. their first album was great but had poor recording quality. WAKING the FALLEN is one of the best albums ive heard in the past 7-10 years, which may sound ridiculous but is true. and whoever said that their 80's hair metal should retire from life.
0375758992|4.0|I've been stuck in an Africa rut lately, especially after reading The Poisonwood Bible for a second time this summer. Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight was refreshing. It offered me a completely different point of view because everything else included in my \\"Africa rut\\" has consisted of characters learning how to coexist with the native habitants. I suppose the main difference here is that in this book the characters have always lived in Africa whereas in all the others, the characters are coming to Africa later in their lives. <br /> <br />Fuller only came to realize that she and her family were considered rich when she was fourteen. She says, \\"And this is how I am almost fourteen years old before I am formally invited into the home of a black  African to share food.\\" Although she lived in Africa, she never actually interacted with anyone except white Africans. Not as much because she looked down on the black Africans, but because she didn't understand her situation.  <br /> <br />This book offers a very interesting point of view, if that's what you're looking for. I enjoyed it thoroughly, just to be taken away from my life in NYC for a short period of time; and also to come out my my \\"Africa rut\\" with a book very much unlike the others.

6304539258|4.0|Let's face it,although a bit dated and flawed in places, the original Star Wars(aka Episode IV A New Hope) is a movie that broke the mold on movie blockbusters.Although slightly altered by George Lucas in recent years, it's still a fascinating movie to behold.   Although hard to comprehend to younger movie goers, when SW first came out in 1977, it was a ground breaking movie with it's state of the arts special effects, which continue to push the bounderies over the past quarter century, and it's fast paced editing.Where most recent science fiction movies were dark, cerebral and apocolyptic,(2001- A Space Odessy, Planet Of The Apes, and Lucas' own THX 1138), SW was an all out action movie that featured heroes to cheer for(Luke Skywalker, Han Solo,Leia Organa), as well as villians to hiss at(Grand Moff Tarkin, and of course, Darth Vader).George Lucas referenced his characters on literary and cinematic classics.    Lucas' enthusiasm for his work  brings out the weaker points of the movie.The acting and screenplay are a bit over the top(Luke's whining,Darth Vader sounding more like a mad scientist, than the sinister figure of Empire Strikes Back), and even the dialogue comes off as forced (Tarkin's foul stench?).    The flaws are petty compared to the impact of the  movie, and the love from fans who would still wait in line for weeks until a new episode .

His failure to recognize or respond to social, emotional, and psychological signals is balanced by a gift of highly advanced spatial and intellectual awareness, and extraordinary processing power.  <br /> <br />Haddon has created a character who shows us immediately a peculiar determination to use his all of gifts at a critical point in his life, when he must respond to shocking and overwhelming information that would cripple any adolescent, let alone an autistic boy of 15 with grotesque obsessions and severe emotional limits.  Haddon poses these intractable problems upon Christopher during a week when he must use all of his powers of intellect to pass a critical math test that will determine whether he is suitable material for a university.  His heavily-illustrated odyssey through England's transit system to find his mother puts us literally into the tight spaces that he occupies, and opens us simultaneously to the vast array of information that bombards each of us all the time.

B000002KXO|3.0|Fleetwood Mac's \\"Mirage\\" album was the second album to follow-up their landmark late 1970's release \\"Rumours\\".   \\"Rumours\\" was a huge commercial success that was built on the raw emotion of the band members.  .  The story of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\" is well documented.  During this time, Christine and John McVie's marriage was falling apart - as was the long term relationship between Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.   One common thread I have noticed about the core members is that they tend to wear their hearts on their sleeve.  When emotions ran high,Mac was at their best.   The emotions that were running through the band were the catalyst for this effort.  Following \\"Rumours\\", Fleetwood Mac went in a very different direction and released what was much more of an experimental album - \\"Tusk\\".   \\"Tusk\\" did have its moments from an artistic standpoint, but didn't have the commercial sales of \\"Rumours\\".  On \\"Mirage\\", Fleetwood Mac attempts to move back to the mainstream formula that worked in the late 1970s - however the band doesn't abandon all of their experimentation.      This album does produce some good music - the only drawback is that this album lacks the raw emotion that \\"Rumours\\" had. <br /> <br />One thing why I feel the emotion might be lacking is that Fleetwood Mac brought in outsiders to collaborate with the songs that were written on this album.     It's not that Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, and Christine McVie are going to abandon all of their songwriting - one of the three members will collaborate on each of the tracks.  However, there isn't one track in which there is a joint collaboration among the three.  You can make the argument that the band was going through the motions of recording together.  However, given the talents of Fleetwood Mac - they are still able to find a way to gel things together.  It was during the early 1980s where the members of Fleetwood Mac were beginning to branch out as solo artists - and each was finding some level of success.  It almost seems like Fleetwood Mac was already fragmented - and that this album was a bit \\"forced\\".  It's also worth noting that Fleetwood Mac would not record together another studio album for another 5 years following \\"Mirage\\".   The influence of the outside artists is not bad - but I think it does take away from the raw emotion. Songs that have the outside influence are: \\"Love in Store\\" (Christine McVie with Jim Recor); \\"Book of Love\\", \\"Oh Diane\\", and \\"Empire State\\" (Lindsey Buckingham with Richard Dashut); \\"Hold Me\\" (Christine McVie and Robbie Patton), \\"Wish You Were Here\\" (Christine McVie with Colin Allen). <br /> <br />As mentioned above, the band does not abandon the idea of experimentation.  For starters - if you want to hear Fleetwood Mac with a bit of a country-edge, listen to the track - \\"That's Alright\\".   Fleetwood Mac is able to pull this off very well - especially with Stevie Nicks on lead vocals.   I've never thought that Lindsey was a very strong songwriter, he does have strengths in a lot of other areas.   In particular, when it comes to background vocals, I feel Lindsey Buckingham is the best in the business.  \\"That's Alright\\" is a  great example on how Lindsey's background vocals blend in beautifully.   It seems that on Stevie Nicks tracks, she finds a way to blend Lindsey's voice in - and does it very well..  There almost is a magic when this duo works vocals together.  It's good on \\"Mirage\\" that we hear more of this. <br /> <br />Two Lindsey Buckingham and Richard Dashut tracks also show some more experimentation.    The songs \\"Book of Love\\" and \\"Oh Diane\\" are retro-style tracks that aren't like anything heard from Fleetwood Mac before.   While \\"Mirage\\" has a lot of 80s type tunes (i.e. \\"Hold Me\\" and \\"Gypsy\\"), it is good that it also has some tunes like these two tracks.   Both \\"Book of Love\\" and \\"Oh Diane\\" sound like late 1950s tracks.   In fact, I think Lindsey does a tremendous job on the lead vocals of both of these tracks.\\"Oh Diane\\" could easily have been a song played on 1959 radio and nobody would bat an eyelash.   While not my favorite track \\"Empire State\\" sound like a tune that could have easily been played in early 1980s dance clubs.  Finally, the Christine McVie penned track \\"Only Over You\\" 'gives inspiration to Dennis Wilson\\" has almost an R&B influence to it.   <br /> <br />This is the album that contains two of Fleetwood Mac's biggest hits.   There is \\"Gypsy\\" that features Stevie Nicks on lead vocals.  Once again, Stevie writes a song and finds a great way to get Lindsey's background vocals in - listen to the end when Lindsey sings \\"Lightning Strikes - maybe once - maybe twice\\" - that's real good stuff.   The other big hit on this collection was \\"Hold Me\\".  This is a terrific duet between Christine and Lindsey - I wish there would be more duets like this.    Other songs that are very good and worth a listen are \\"Eyes of the World\\" - this is a Lindsey penned track and he is in excellent form on his guitar.  \\"Can't Go Back\\" is another Lindsey penned track and has a very catchy beat.  \\"Love in Store\\" is the opening track and features Christine on lead vocals, but both Stevie and Lindsey will also contribute some vocals. <br /> <br />The CD liner notes feature all of the lyrics to all of the songs.  Each song includes all of the songwriting credits.   There are also all of the studio and engineering credits included.   I think its also worth noting that Fleetwood Mac produces all of the sounds on this album - although they might have collaborated with outside songwriters, they don't bring in outside musicians.  I think the serious Fleetwood Mac fan will like this album, but it will take a few listens before it grows on you.  It's still not Rumours - overall I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.

I finally realized that my dealings with these men were going NOWHERE because they just weren't that into me.  Any other time I would have been upset and wondered why, maybe cried or something, but this book made me realize that it's a part of life, a part of dating.  There have even been men in MY life that I was just not that into.  It happens.  This book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know, but it gave me reality and the truth in such a way that I couldn't help but laugh about it, get myself out of those relationships that weren't good for me, and set out to find the one that WILL be into me.  This book isn't about what women SHOULD do to find a man, it's all about finding yourself, boosting your self esteem, not taking crap from the men in your life and getting yourself out of bad relationships to make way for the good ones.  :)
B000002IQW|5.0|This has to be one of the best if not the best rock CD of all time.  Believe me, I am a huge fan of all things rock.  Metallica, AC/DC, Guns N' Roses, Black Sabbath, you name it, I know it and love it.  But this CD surpasses all of them by a long shot.  It is spectacular.  First of all, Sebastian Bach (vocals) has to be the best vocalist of all time.  In my opinion, he's better than Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickenson, and even Freddy Mercury.  He can scream better than anyone on the planet yet he still manages to sing beautiful ballads.  He is what the record is, Amazing.  The guitarist rivals the best and deserves to be recognized up on the pedastal with Slash and Eddie Van Halen.  Although the bass and the drums are overshadowed by Bach, it is still obvious that they are great at what they do.  I recommend this CD for any fan of Skid Row or Rock music for that matter.  It is what metal stands for and is required for any true headbanger.
B000031EGV|4.0|During one of my late nights I watched Jumanji again.  This is a film starring Robin Williams and is based on a children's book (if by based one can mean it shares the title and a few illustrations).  The film was released as a special effects extravaganza but failed to live up to the advertising. <br /> <br />Jumanji is a mysterious board game.  Once you start to play you have to end the game.  Each roll of the dice unleashes some new nasty obstacle that must be overcome.  This can be giant mosquitos and spiders, monkeys and lions, earthquakes, stampedes, quicksand and carnivorous vines, or something even nastier.  When Robin Williams was a young boy he found the game buried at a construction site.  The opening moves resulted in Williams being banished to the game until someone rolls a five or an eight.  Unfortunately no one believes the young girl who had been playing the game with him. <br /> <br />The scene jumps ahead twenty-six years to the present and the new residents of the house find the old game and begin to play.  Williams is returned, now twenty-six years older and very jungle-wise.  The first things out of the game were destructive enough that the kids decide to finish the game so that everything will be back to normal.  Unfortunately the game thinks there are now four players.  Williams must find his childhood friend and convince her to continue the game. <br /> <br />As more and more destructive forces are released we learn that Williams's disappearance caused the town to go into a tailspin.  The new horrors just speed up the decay.  The four players face frustrating and deadly things as they finally finish the game.  In the end all is returned to normal.  The normal of when the game was started twenty-six years previously.  Williams is now a kid again.  The scene jumps to the present again and the town is prosperous while Williams tracks down the kids he finished the game with. <br /> <br />This is a very intense film and was probably not suited forthe young target audience.  This was marketed as a fun fantasy cor children, but what this film is in fact is juvenile horror.  Not bad horror, but horror aimed at kids.  Taken in that light it is a very well done film with tense moments, humor and subtleties and is worth checking out.  But if you are looking for a fun-filled farce you would do better to look elsewhere. <br />
B000003TAL|5.0|ok the first time i listened to this the only song i dug was \\"Teenage riot\\" i thought it was a fantastic song but was turned off by the rest of the album which i thought was just filled to the brim with straight noise making it almost impossible to enjoy. still, i was intreagued by it; from most accounts people think this album is one of the best of the alternative movement. so i popped it in one day when i had nothing to do. by the time \\"the sprawl\\" had ended i was entranced by the music. its an album filled with majesty, so much so that i almost feel like i should compare it to Television's Marquee Moon.  <br /> <br />this album is not accessible at first, acctually its quite abrasive. but if you look deep enough into it you can hear the deep cerebral beauty the youth have presented
1400032717|5.0|Written in the style of a first person narrative by an autistic teenage boy, \\"The Curious Incident\\" gently and cleverly conveys how alien and overwhelming our culture must be to anyone who is an outsider.  Christopher Boone is only capable of literal interpretations.  He does not understand nuances of emotions or facial expressions, so the book is often funny, as he tries to understand what others mean when they communicate with him.  He has rituals that help him to cope with stress, and his daily world is filled with stress, as he notices every detail of his surroundings.  He lacks intuition, but his mind is highly intelligent and logical.  He innocently sets out to solve the murder of a neighbor's dog, but in doing so unravels a web of mystery in his own family.  Given all the obstacles of his disability, he shows tremendous courage and ingenuity to arrive at the truth.  Anyone who has navigated through the crowds in the London Underground or traveled to a foreign country without knowing the language, will understand how bombarded this poor boy feels almost every moment of his adventure.  He's also brilliant at math, so I learned a lot about prime numbers.  I recommend this very engaging story.
B000002H4Q|5.0|It took about 10-15 listens, but it dawned on me that Kiss Me is one of the Cure's finest efforts.  I've read that this album has filler, but 10 or 11 tracks are good.  I would have to disagree with that.  What is endearing about this album is the ideas it portrays, and it never really is as happy as the music would let on.  \\"The Kiss\\" is a fantastic epic, just brutal.  \\"Torture\\" \\"All I Want\\" \\"Shiver & Shake\\" and \\"If Only Tonight...\\" are great guitar tracks, riddled with doom.  But I find the tracks like \\"One More Time\\", \\"A Thousand Hours\\", \\"Like Cockatoos\\", and \\"Icing Sugar\\" to be Cure in perfect form.  They are just lush, spacey, beautiful tracks.  Robert Smith is the darkly romantic icon of this era, and for good reason.
0060555661|5.0|The value of this book is in the investment philosophies that Graham goes out of is way to state and restate into redundancy.  As Graham states in the book, \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" focuses less on the technicalities of his analysis's, and more on the ideals behind them.  These ideals include: <br /> <br />     patience in waiting for the right opportunites to appear, <br /> <br />     patience in ownership of a stock until it's true market value is recognized,  <br /> <br />     evaluating a company and estimating it's 'intrinsic value' (what you would pay for it)  <br /> <br />     searching for stocks that are undervalued and more.   <br /> <br />Most of the ideas he brings up all revolve around a central theme of having a \\"margin of safety\\" in all your investments.  He also states that if you don't have the traits required to stick to these ideals, you would do best to stick with an index fund for your common stock investments.  This book is recommended to anyone who is looking to become a more aggressive investor since it provides a basic foundation for you to build on.   <br /> <br />For all it's strengths, this book as well as \\"Securities Analysis\\" have a common weakness which is that the ways that Graham found 'value' investments are much more difficult to find today.  Value investing has been around for half a century now and has recently been making a comeback because of the bursting of the tech bubble.  As Graham also states, the more prevalent a certain approach to investing becomes, the more diluted its earnings potential becomes.  Opportunities such as 'net-nets' (stocks whose market value fall below their book value) are extremely rare to find today.  It is up to the reader to discern how he/she can take advantage and apply his ideas to the market today.  (Which the best books usually do) <br /> <br />A word of note.  Most value investors point to Warren Buffet as evidence of the profitability of value investing although Buffet is not a purist and places just as great an emphasis on intangible assests (such as branding and management).  Opportunites, such as his 8% stake in Coca-cola would have been missed by someone strictly adhering to the Graham-Dodd model. <br /> <br />In short, even with its inevitable weaknesses, \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" is an important addition to the library of any person who wishes to become an aggressive investor.
0380789035|5.0|A discussion of Anthropology, History and Paganism led a friend to strongly recommend \\"American Gods\\" to me.  When I purchased the book, I literally could not put this one down.  I tried.  I looked at the clock, and knew I had to go to bed, or study for college Literary courses...but, I could not stop reading...\\"just one more chapter,\\" I would console myself.  Needless to say, I finished the book in a couple of days and I will definitely need to order more of Neil Gaiman's books.<br /><br />In one of my English courses, we were discussing \\"static\\" characters, and--IMHO--the main character of \\"American Gods\\" seems to be just that (a static character)...however, this is not a bad thing.  There is so much going-on around and happening TO the main character that he is as livley as any action hero, despite his disposition. I could explain this, but it would ruin the plot.<br /><br />Just buy the book.  If you know anything about Pantheons, Mythology, \\"Gods\\" and waking-up on the wrong side of bed, you'll love this book!

B00005JNEI|5.0|F911 makes a strong case that the ruling elites in this country have manipulated public opinion through the use of fear and militarism, in order to build support for a war that has nothing to do with national defense, and instead represents an imperial project for corporate profit. You be the judge of the merits or demerits of the case, but it is a case well-made.
0312263120|3.0|This was my first book by Dan Brown, and probably my last.  He wrote a minithriller, attemping the Clancy style.  I found the plot interesting, and I did have trouble putting down the book.  He wrote a passible thriller. <br /> <br />But the book impinges on several areas of my interest and even expertise, and it appears to be entiring uncontaminated by knowledge of the underlying technologies.  Any CISSP could have shown poked a dozen holes in the putative Internet security at the NSA.  In fact, if the NSA were that incompetent, Cuba would have overrun our republic years ago.  The bits of cryptography were technical gibberish, using real words in phantom ways.  And he misunderstands the difference between the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan. <br /> <br />My friends who have studied the middle ages have similar complaints about the DaVinci Code. <br /> <br />Still, despite the technical tomfoolery, I enjoyed reading the book. <br />
B00004U8JU|5.0|I may harp a lot about how modern technology has taken a lot of the artistic element out of modern cinema.  However, when modern technolgy is placed in the right hands with the right script, some pretty great things can be accomplished.  I offer as Exhibit A; \\"Jurassic Park\\".  This is one terrific movie that captivates our attention with its creation of the realistic image of modern-day dinosaurs while, at the same time, captivating us further with a thrilling tale of suspenseful adventure.  The acting is terrific as well as the writing, cinematography, directing, editing, and, of course, the special effects. <br /> <br />The story line is a bit of a stretch.  For example, I never really understood how the frogs fit into it all.  Then there is the challenge of finding so many different mosquitos frozen in amber.  The mine was a nice touch but I had a hard time that they would find so many who had just the right blood properly preserved for this all to happen.  However, we could just let it be and accept the possibility that it COULD work.  Once we did that, the rest of the movie was spellbinding.  Most people have seen the movie and are familiar with the Adventure Park concept that several \\"experts\\" were brought in to review before its' grand opening.  How everthing looks so terrific until something goes wrong.  If you haven't seen the movie, take my word for it; you should!  Some may scoff at this or that aspect but I was wrapped up in the whole experience by the time it finally ended.  (By the way, what was with the pelicans?  Was there some message there that I missed?).  <br /> <br />A brief disclaimer; This movie came out at a time when dinosaurs were a real popular thing with kids; especially elementary school children.  Lots of moms took their kids to see the dinorsaurs that the advertizements said were in the movie.  There were a lot of subsequent complaints about traumatized youngsters who weren't ready for some of the reality of what might happen when manand dinorsaur met.  If their bed time is before 9PM, you might want to let your kids skip this one until you've previewed it.  It's worth staying up past 11PM to watch.
B000244EMO|4.0|This often overlooked film is one of a handful of films to have transcended the action genre and be known simply as a great movie.  The plot is simple yet intriguing, the special effects are awesome, and the acting is above par for an action movie.  \\"Predator\\" is suspenseful and exhilirating, its \\"Alien\\" set in the jungle. <br /> <br />     Not even two minutes in you know you're going to enjoy watching it.  Its just after dawn, there's a helicopter flying in over this South American beach, all the while there's this invigorating score blasting.  The door opens, a group of soldiers, adamantine in appearance, step off.  The cast of characters has been given and in less than five minutes the basic plot is known:  toughest group of guys in the military has to go in, kick butt, take names, pick up some people, and high tail it outta there.  No problem. <br /> <br />    The film is broken down into three major series.  First, the team goes marching into the jungle with all of the bravado in the world.  Second, they're picked off one-by-one by an unseen assassin.  Last, Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) makes an effort to save the remaining members, and like some of the fallen, even the score. <br /> <br />    The first sequence is more entertaining than most.  The dialogue, while not Shakespeare, is equal to say, \\"Terminator 2\\".  Dutch's group rolls through a guerilla camp like Sherman through Atlanta; they raze the place to the ground.  Blain (Jesse Ventura) is of particular note, as his quips are sharper than most, that, and he carries a mini-gun. <br /> <br />    After surviving their skirmish intact and picking up one hostage they start their trek to the extraction point.  People start getting dismembered, corpses disappear, and Dutch and his crew can't figure out what is going on.  The film is excellent in maintaining its suspense by not showing the Predator at this point.  Since, it has some sort of invisible camouflage, only an outline is shown.  A failed attemptis made at capturing the creature and from here the movie transitions into its final act. <br /> <br />    The group splits up, two members unsuccesfully chase after Predator, and the rest flee.  I won't go into detail about the efforts of Mac (Bill Duke) and Dillon (Carl Weathers) to attack the beast, but it is handled with style and finesse.  Dutch and and the hostage are split up when Predator doubles back.  A few surprises are thrown out and Dutch takes a reprieve. <br /> <br />    The film's denouement is brilliant both in style and substance.  The film's nightime aesthetics are welcome.  Dutch and the Predator move around in the dark, taking shots at one another and playing cat and mouse games.  As they go back and forth, it is to the film's credit that it is unclear how it will all end.  Will Dutch survive?  As they move closer and closer to hand-to-hand combat this becomes a bigger question.  Alas, I can't give away the ending. <br /> <br />     I would argue that the film is really combination of two earlier films:  \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\".  Here you have a surprised crew and a single enemy that moves in secret like \\"Alien\\" but you have a military force that wants go on the offensive like the marines in \\"Aliens\\".  However, director John McTiernan is much more like Cameron (director of \\"Aliens\\") and not at all like Ridley Scott (director of \\"Alien\\") in style. <br /> <br />      <br />
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Great stay at home on a Saturday night flick, with your girlfriend, when there is nothing else on, and you want to cuddle in the dark on the couch. If you want to really get freaked out, try Gartel's-Trance, Dance and Other Living Things DVD.  I have previously recommended this for people that get bored quick, and have a short attention span. The images on this DVD move so quickly it is almost impossible to take your eyes off the screen.  This combined with the surround sound music and effect, will make you dizzy.

B000003TBP|1.0|Rock and Roll began as a fusion of musical styles and has a tradition of fusing new styles to one another for the past 50 years.  However, there is such a thing as overkill and that is exactly what Beck does. <br />\\"Odelay\\" sounds like a child making a musical collage with his father's record collection.  Even Beck's appearance is rather child like.  Like a child, Beck succeeds in making a giant random, mess on this album. <br />If the point of the album was to be childlike, then he forgot the key element of what makes being a child fun, which is an endless well of energy.  Beck's vocal style is typical of Indie Rock, monotone and lifeless.  Coupled with the bizarre lyrics, there is nothing to grab onto to. <br />It seems the music is extremely eclectic to cross musical boundaries.  If there was a reason to cross those boundaries to make something powerful or memorable that would be great, but he breaks the rules just to break them. <br />\\"Odelay\\" is basically the regurgitation of 30 years of pop culture.  No matter how much you analyze a pile of vomit, it's still a pile of vomit. <br /> <br />
B0001XAPX8|4.0|...I had the feeling that this film pretty much lost sight of the woods for the trees.  It begins with Achilles' dilemma in The Iliad with a slave girl which his king also covets, then quickly moves to the excesses of political correctness in academia, then to American sexual hypocrisy and sanctimony in the Clinton-Lewinsky affair, to a Viagra-assisted, sixty-something sudden-widower who suddenly lands a vivacious thirty-something woman from a very different social and economic class background with a very checkered past, her Vietnam-scarred psychopathic ex-husband who stalks her, the dramatic reinvigoration and sexual reawakening in such a winter-spring relationship, to the deeply ingrained racism in American society as experienced by a mulatto boy who decides to pass himself as Jewish and breaks ties with his family.<br /><br />All this might be gracefully contained in a 400-page novel (maybe...I haven't read Roth's book yet) but crammed into a 2-hour movie, it all feels a bit disjointed.<br /><br />While Kidman, Hopkins, Harris and Sinese are all a bit miscast in their roles, all three put in solid performances...Kidman has never looked more appealing and real, in contrast to her usual generic-blonde look.  Hopkins isn't quite up to the anguish and explosive rage that his character is supposed to express in a few of the scenes---he simply doesn't have the range for it---but is otherwise competent. The film is beautifully shot, with a very effective score, and technically superb.<br /><br />What's missing though is any kind of overarching theme or point to tie everything together.  I suppose we could deduce one from the title: \\"The Human Stain\\" as a rather misanthropic treatise on the abject depths to which humanity constantly sinks?  It's possible but there is no strong impetus to be found in the movie, which ends with Harris and Sinese conversing upon a frozen lake.  The scene is well-acted, well-written, well-directed...but again, like the entire film, while enjoyable leaves us scratching our heads and wondering what in the world it was all supposed to be ABOUT., while enjoyable leaves us scratching our heads and wondering what in the world it was all supposed to be ABOUT.

B0002O06N0|4.0|There is something great about rock and roll. To discover this greatness, you have to feel it. And timing is essential, for example- waking up on a Saturday morning and putting on that great song that sounds even better when it's that first riff-o-the-morning. People who love the dirty, bluesy, riff crazy rock can relate to this- and if one has that void to fill, try taking a smack to the head with the Black Keys. While reminiscent of mid-career Hendrix along with fried chicken, Rubber Factory will leave that chicken smell in your nose for a while, and that is what it seems the Black Keys aimed to do. \\"10 AM Automatic\\" is a perfect example of this, but it won't stop there, as the guitar hops around like a bouncy ball- sometimes bouncing too high. In other words: if you like back to basics rock and roll but need it entirely fresh, new, exciting, and maybe just a dash of the feeling that many had when they plopped Hendrix on their turntables for the first time, then you might want to consider The Black Keys. So much for tangents.
B000007R1M|5.0|Quite possibly the most futuristic and revolutionary album of our times, The Man Machine is an amazing album that introduced the listener to the basics of modern day techno/trance music way back in 1978. The tracks just seem to blend into each other, and from the opening track \\"The Robots\\" to the last one \\"The Man Machine\\" , this album is a blueprint of what an amazing, ground-breaking electronic album should be. This is the album that hooked me onto electronica, and is an album I have been listening to for the last 20+ years, and it still gets my head shaking as to the brilliance of this album...check it out, you won't be disappointed....
B000058BGV|5.0|I sing with Bach Festival in Winter Park, Florida and recently was talking with the director, Dr. John Sinclair. He has taken classes with Dr. Mons, the leading German authority on the music of Bach. Dr. Mons says, \\"The English are wonderful, but they don't know Bach.\\" It seems that they simply do not understand structures and tempi. The point is that Richter was a Lutheran pastor's son. He understood Bach and Lutheran theology. His tempi may seem slow, but they underline the texts and make the structures clear. In other words, Richter is right. If you want to hear Bach in the authentic German tradition listen to Richter's recordings of the Mass in B Minor, The St Matthew Passion, the Weinachten Oratorium, the Mozart Requiem, and the St John Passion, plus any of the many cantata recordings. They emerge as revelations compared to the many recordings that are available today.
B00005JMJG|5.0|To consider the position of Charlie Kaufman in the Hollywood universe look at the career M. Night Shyamalan.  Once you successfully trick your audience in a film they laugh and then demand that you do it again...and again...and again.  Shyamalan's latest film, \\"The Village,\\" got trashed by a lot of people because it did the surprises were not good enough.  Having written \\"Being John Malkovich,\\" \\"Adaptation,\\" and \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\\" and facing the daunting prospect of doing it again, Kaufman came up with \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\\"  To be fair, the idea came was given to Kaufman by director Michel Gondry, who got from his friend, the artist Pierre Bismuth, the idea of getting a card in the mail that says \\"You have been erased from someone's memory.\\"  But it was Kaufman who came up with the story.<br /><br />\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is much more of a love story than anything Kaufman has written before, even with the writer's twisted view.  The title is taken from Alexander Pope's poem \\"Eloisa to Abelard,\\" and the story is of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), who discovers that his ex-girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) is not merely pretending not to know who he is, but has actually had her memories of him wiped clean.  After going through brief periods of disbelief and outrage, Joel demands that Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) wipe his memory as well.  But while he is going through the process and he relives the memories that are being erased, Joel has second thoughts.  However, since he is \\"under\\" the process what can he do to save his precious memories?<br /><br />Most of this movie takes place while Joel undergoes the process.  The procedure is taking place at an apartment rather than at the office, where Joel is supposed to be monitored by a pair of Mierzwiak's assistants.  However, Stan (Mark Ruffalo) is too busy jumping around on the bed with Mary (Kirsten Dunst) while they are both in their underwear.  Meanwhile, Patrick (Elijah Wood) has gotten a crush on Clementine and is using some of Joel's choice memories to impress her.  As his memories of the good times with Clementine are swept away one by one, Joel tries to find a way to fight back.  Then the Clementine of his memories suggests she take him into other memories where she never was so that they can hide out.  This is when Stan discovers that Joel has gone \\"off the map\\" and has to summon Dr. Mierzwiak to save the day.<br /><br />The attractive moral here is quite simple: love might be forgettable, but it is still indestructible.  Obviously this film is all about memories and the mind, but it also argues the importance of the heart.  You have to pay attention to this film because Joel Barish has become unstuck in his memories and once they start to fuse and merge things can get a bit confusing.  There are memories that are being remembered, altered, and forgotten, and sometimes they come fast and furious.  Still, I think that having cut our teeth on \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" \\"Memento,\\" and other films that play fast and loose with the idea of narrative chronology, audiences are more willing to except the roller coaster ride of this 2004 film than they would have a decade ago.<br /><br />Carey's performance is one of his best.  We know full well that he can do dramatic roles, but this time he is doing a markedly better job of stripping away even more of his standard mannerisms and vocal affectations, so that you have no trouble thinking this is Joel.  I actually enjoy his dramatic films more than his wild and crazy guy efforts, so I hope the actor finds the positive responses to this role encouraging.  The character of Clementine is a free spirit, but since Winslet is playing her there is a sense of weight that you would not get with another actress (e.g., Kate Hudson).  That becomes a key reason for us to hope these two find each other again, even if they do not remember who the other one is any more.  But in the end it is Kaufman's story that carries this film, which is one of the most unusual love stories you will have ever seen.  You can only wonder what Kaufman will come up with next (no idea of the plot, but the director will be Spike Jonze again as it was on \\"Adaptation\\").nd it is Kaufman's story that carries this film, which is one of the most unusual love stories you will have ever seen.

B00028U6B8|5.0|I haven't done a side-by-side comparison with the Mobile Fidelity CD, but I think RCA have done VOLUNTEERS proud. The band's first 16 track recording, the album's dense production always suffered on vinyl (especially on Dynaflex) but it has been substantially sorted-out here thanks to the state of digital recording technologies. <br /> <br />I was relieved to hear, from the get-go, a palpable bass presence, and as with the new remaster of BLESS ITS POINTED LITTLE HEAD, the multiple strands of instrumentalists are so clearly delineated that you can listen to the whole canvas or decide which musician you'd care to focus on, and follow. I never quite realized what a percussive performance \\"We Can Be Together\\" is given: Spencer Dryden's drums are competing with Paul's Kantner's acoustic and Nicky Hopkins' piano, and probably Marty Balin's tambourine, but as I say, all are audible now, giving the track an impressive sonic complexity. The acoustic guitars on \\"Good Shepherd\\" and \\"Turn My Life Down\\" sound as clear as river water chuckling over rocks in the flow, and all of the drums in Spencer's kit have clearer definition, so that we not only hear a backbeat but lots of jazz-flavored fills and percussive coloring. The most impressive tracks, sonically, are the ones that are most sparsely instrumentalized, such as \\"Eskimo Blue Day,\\" and the extra space introduced in the sound of the recording gives Jack Casady's bass that much extra room in which to sound fuller, more rounded. (If this album has any seminal fault, it's that the band went overboard filling those 16 tracks, not realizing that less can be more, as is demonstrated here.) Even weaker tracks like \\"The Farm\\" and \\"A Song for All Seasons\\" become more interesting given the more pronounced and appreciable interplay of the musicians, especially Hopkins and Casady. Still, I have to accord MVP rating on this album to Jorma Kaukonen, never more impassioned in the studio than during his searing solo on \\"Wooden Ships\\" and never more mind-boggling than in his duet with himself on Grace Slick's \\"Hey Fredrick.\\" The outstanding quality of his performance has shone through the murkiest mixes and masterings RCA could hurl at this album, and it's just breathtaking here. <br /> <br />Unlike the live bonus tracks on BLESS ITS POINTED LITTLE HEAD, the live bonus tracks on VOLUNTEERS -- same venue, one year later -- are superb and a boon to the overall package. The band is well-mixed and they play as if they know they are being recorded, and it matters to them to be at their best. Some audience members have clearly heard the new album and respond warmly when \\"Wooden Ships\\" is introduced, and this, \\"Good Shepherd\\" and the title track are all given near-definitive live recitals. <br /> <br />Warmly recommended. <br /> <br />Pet warning: The rumbling iceberg sounds that close \\"Eskimo Blue Day\\" sent my cats running out of the room. <br />

B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt(1992). Alice In Chains' Second Album.<br /><br />In 1991, Nirvana and Pearl Jam turned the Rock 'N Roll industry on its head. Happy, upbeat, nothin' but a good time metal was gone, replaced with gloomy, serious, and depressing hard rock. Alice In Chains, who had a minor hit in 1990 with \\"Man In The Box\\", released Dirt in 1992 on the same day as The Stone Temple Pilot's 'Core'. Alice In Chains was immediately typecast as a Grunge band, mostly since they were from Seattle, and it helped 'Dirt' go to the top of the charts and spawn huge hits like \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Down In A Hole\\", \\"Angry Chair\\", and \\"Would?\\". Most people who listened to Dirt will tell you it was not only Alice In Chains' best, but one of the best albums ever released; Does it live up to the hype? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Them Bones- Dirt's opener, \\"Them Bones\\", is short, yet Cantrell's thumping guitar lick and Layne Staley's demented vocals make this \\"Them Bones\\" an incredibly dark and magnificent song.<br /><br />Dam That River- When you hear \\"Dam That River\\", if you're not headbanging, your neck is either immobolized, or more likely, you're dead! Cantrell's sarcastic and sneering guitar backs up Layne Staley's angry and sneering vocals. Imagine Pantera, with a hint of melodicism; it's great!<br /><br />Rain When I Die- The perfect ode to drugs and depression, \\"Rain When I Die\\" starts off with a trippy intro, full of distortion and random noises, but switches over to a dark mindtrip. Cantrell's guitar blares out like Black Sabbath's sludgy style, and Staley goes from begging for forgiveness to sounding almost hopeful. A very dark, yet surprisingly hopeful and melodic song, \\"Rain When I Die\\" is almost \\"Down In A Hole\\"'s evil twin.<br /><br />Down In A Hole- To put it simply, \\"Down In A Hole\\" is easily my favorite ballad, and Alice In Chains just barely topped this with \\"Rooster\\". I can't put this into words; Cantrell's hopeful, soul-searching guitar harmony sets the tone, and he puts his heart and soul into the song. Layne Staley just flat-out shows why he's the best vocalist I've ever heard; his emotion and energy will bring a tear to your eye.<br /><br />Sickman- Imagine being wrecked by drugs, and \\"Sickman\\" is what you might feel like. An insane track, Cantrell spits out sludgy Black Sabbath-y licks, and even breaches Death Metal territory, while Layne Staley sounds like a man slowly dieing from an overdose, yet managing to tell his story. Extremely trippy and surreal, \\"Sickman\\" is Dirt's epic, with frequently changing time signatures and brilliant musicianship.<br /><br />Rooster- A song about Cantrell's father in Vietnam, \\"Rooster\\" is Alice In Chains' signature song, and one of their strongest. Beginning with Cantrell's spacy guitar melody and a strange choir, Layne Staley soon enters, spitting out vocals totally devoid of hope, warning that \\"here comes the rooster\\" and \\"you know we ain't gonna die\\". Jerry Cantrell keeps the song alive, using his spacy distortion to keep give Staley an edge he wouldn't have without him. Incredible!<br /><br />Junkhead- Almost a continuation of \\"Sickman\\", \\"Junkhead\\" tells the story of a junkie. The sludgy guitar backs up Layne's half-crazed and depressing vocals. Although hints of melodicism shine through in the chorus, where Staley shouts \\"What's my drug of choice?\\", \\"Junkhead\\" is a dark, unabashedly depressing song. Imagine a blend of Black Sabbath and Slayer.<br /><br />Dirt- The album's title track, \\"Dirt\\" is your typical Alice In Chains track; depressing and dark. Jerry Cantrell's guitar lick is a very distorted melody, yet, to me, it seems to have an obvious Middle-Eastern influence. Layne Staley sounds like a suicidal maniac hell-bent on world domination; in other words, he sounds friggin' unbelieveable! Cantrell's solo sounds magnificent, and \\"Dirt\\" is yet another winner.<br /><br />God Smack- Obviously, the Alice In Chains' influenced band Godsmack got their name from \\"God Smack\\", atrack that sounds surprisingly like Godsmack's hit \\"Get Away\\", a sneery and insulting song that sticks in your head. Layne is top-notch here, and Cantrell lets loose one of his best solos on Dirt.<br /><br />Intro(Dream Sequence)- Weird, but a nice filler track.<br /><br />Hate To Feel- A jumpy track, \\"Hate To Feel\\" is another track like \\"Sickman\\" and \\"\\", yet Cantrell adds in a guitar lick not unlike Black Sabbath's \\"Iron Man\\" and Megadeth's \\"The Killing Road\\". Layne Staley just explains the next sentence for himself: he's perfect. A good song.<br /><br />Angry Chair- One of Dirt's biggest hits, \\"Angry Chair\\" is one of Alice In Chains' best. Featuring a seedy and depressing guitar melody, not unlike on \\"Rooster\\", Jerry Cantrell spits out guitar licks and harmonics that sound hopelessly depressed. Layne Staley's vocals are so gloomy at times, it sounds as if he's dying of an incurable disease. The melodic chorus is a nice touch to \\"Angry Chair\\", and one of many reasons I love this song.<br /><br />Would?- A track reminiscent of Alice In Chains' later material, \\"Would?\\" is a track that would've fit in well with the mysterious and sobering 'Alice In Chains'. Very mysterious and foreboding, \\"Would?\\" sports a spaced out and quirky guitar lick, and Layne Staley's vocals sound incredibly emotional and almost as if he's apologizing for his sins. Very emotional and epic, \\"Would?\\" is one of Dirt's highlights.<br /><br />Overall, 'Dirt' is easily Alice In Chains' finest moment, and definitely an album I'll treasure forever. Although stereotyped as a Grunge band, Alice In Chains is a no-holds-bared Heavy Metal band, taking the dark sludginess of Black Sabbath and infecting it with an even more hopeless and depressing tone, not to mention upping the distortion, while always keeping hints of melodicism. While the song descriptions I gave might make them seem like they're all the same depressing junk, don't think that: Each song is brilliant and full of emotion almost no other bands possess. Alice In Chains were the band that made me discover music, and I know they will open you up to a whole new dimension of music too.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!r name from \\"God Smack\\", a track that sounds surprisingly like Godsmack's hit \\"Get Away\\", a sneery and insulting song that sticks in your head.

B000001F5F|4.0|\\"Specially Priced Mini-LP\\" was how this collection was described way back when old-timers like myself first grabbed it on vinyl in late 1983. The appellation still fits, I suppose, as UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY is, at just over thirty-five minutes, too long for an EP but still a bit brief for a proper live album. In any case, this was, I recall, an exciting time to be a U2 fan. The band had just taken off in America on the strength of its third album, WAR, various singles from which were in regular rotation on FM radio and the then-embryonic format of MTV. Meanwhile, classic rock bands were breaking up left and right; punk was dead as a legitimate cultural phenomenon; heavy metal had happened; the new wave was fast exhausting its extremely limited bag of tricks; and of course, Michael Jackson ruled the universe. For a genre in jeapordy, the need was desperate; U2 filled it then, as it's continued to do for much of the two decades since.     UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY captures the band at the height of its WAR tour, drawing together eight songs (Why not more?) from a trio of shows in Germany, Denver and Boston. Each of U2's first three albums is represented, and while the song selection may not be all that surprising it certainly highlights the energy and earnestness that made stars of this young quartet. \\"Gloria,\\" the opening track from OCTOBER, starts things off here as well in an effective rendition which clearly got the crowd on its feet. From BOY, \\"I Will Follow\\" and \\"The Elecric Co.\\" are both present, the latter distinguished by the inclusion of its rousing in-concert preface, \\"Cry.\\" Not surprisingly, WAR is the most thoroughly covered of the LPs, with \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"40\\" taking up most of the second half. \\"40\\" makes a particularly strong closer, as the audience continues chanting the \\"How long to sing this song?\\" refrain even after the band, one by one, has left the stage. Other than that, the tunes aren't greatly expanded upon, as U2 has never exactly been a jamming band - indeed, the entire last verse of \\"New Year's Day\\" is omitted, Bono and Company choosing for some reason to perform the single edit of the song (although, perhaps by way of compensation, \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" is slightly extended). Of particular interest is the inclusion of two non-LP numbers: \\"Eleven o'Clock, Tick Tock,\\" an excellent and infectiously danceable A-side from the BOY era which, like far too many early U2 singles, has never been reissued on CD; and \\"Party Girl,\\" a bizarre B-side from 1982 originally done as a whiny acoustic track (available on the out-of-print THE B-SIDES, 1980-1990).      I should mention that there is a curious bit of editing on the CD version of this album, as Bono's improvised vocal (to the tune of \\"Send In the Clowns\\") over the slow middle section of \\"The Electric Co.,\\" which I clearly remember from the vinyl version, has been excised. A licensing problem? Or did rock's most notoriously verbose frontman sing something he later wished he hadn't? It will, I suppose, just have to remain a mystery....     UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY gave most of us our first taste of live U2, and in retrospect it serves as a nice summing-up of the band's early years. When next they appeared, in the fall of 1984, it would be with a markedly different sound, new producers and a far less youthful worldview. But that's another story.
B0002VKZL6|3.0|I eagerly awaited this fourth release by Mark Knopfler. I will say that Golden Heart and Sailing to Philadelphia it isn't.<br />This album is much more in line with his last release The Ragpicker's Dream and Neck and Neck.<br />Gone are the upbeat fast paced songs like Darling Pretty, What it is, Speedway at Nazareth, and Why Aye Man. Instead we are treated to a much more mellow album on par with songs such as Tahitian Skies, There'll be some changes made, and Daddy's Gone to Knoxville.<br />Gone too are the folk like songs, Je Suis Desole, Done with Bonaparte, Prairie Wedding, and Fare thee Well Northumberland,  that, for me, are what really makes Knopfler so great.<br />That being said, this is still a great album. I especially enjoyed 5.15a.m., back to tupelo, and song for sonny liston. There is a ghost of his former songs in this new collection and if you listen really hard, you can still hear snippets of guitar riffs from previous Knopfler songs.<br />I'm happy I bought this album. Will I play it as often as often as Golden Heart and Sailing to Philadelphia, probably not, but it will still come out, especially when I want to introduce friends to the beauty and diversity that is Mark Knopfler.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Farenheit 9/11 is the prime example of journalism in the free world.  He is on target and on point.  He takes to task Bush and his cronies, calling them out for their atrocities.  Video doesn't lie, but I do understand clever editing.  His point of view, I happen to believe.  If you are thinking aof voting or talk to people that are, buy this DVD.  Money well spent.  If you are in the boat that doesn't support Moore, then you can probably catch a free showing in your neighborhood.
B00003XACV|2.0|First of all, before anyone immediately rushes to deem this review \\"unhelpful\\", let me describe something.  The concept of this soundtrack is amazing in it's right.  There are majour highlights to this cd which excel past things which other soundtracks are trailing behind in.  However, it is not a perfect cd.   <br /> <br />The highlight of the score begins immediately and sets hopes for you to expect.  \\"Dead Already\\", despite the ill-sounding name, is a playful track with a great xylophone-marimba tune with an odd sound aiding it in the background.  At first, when things start getting better, Newman introduces his secret weapon: the foreign percussion which he uses.  I have let some of my friends hear this, both foreign and not foreign, and all have agreed on the excellent usage of this for the single opening and ending (which is generally the exact same thing with few differences) tracks. <br /> <br />However, this expectation that was laid down never really fufills itself.  Instead, we have a drone of tracks which sound excellent for about twenty seconds...then become repetitive and warranting a skip.  They all have nice tunes and occassionally a piano theme, but never really go beyond and aadd anything worthwhile. <br /> <br />In track 8, American Beauty, we are given a soothing, gentle piano and strings joint, with one of the most relaxing themes I've heard to date.  The track drones on, but is still a great listen - had it been a bit shorter, it would have been perfect.  This brought the standard up a bit, but then we still have the same repetitive music again later.  \\"Choking the Bishop\\", while it worked for the movie, is extremely difficult to listen to.  Finally, \\"Any Other Name\\" and \\"Still Dead\\" gives us what we already heard, almost exactly to the point.   <br /> <br />My basic point is that the concept for this soundtrack is superb, but it has poor execution.  For the film, it works spectacularly, but as a sole soundtrack, it doesn't live up to what it could produce potentially.  However, the few minutes of excellent music we do get to hear is enough to warrant a reccomendation from me, but I will only give it two stars in it's overall presentation.
B00003CXE7|4.0|\\"Gladiator\\" is about what a man has to do to become more than just a man. Malcolm X, John F. Kennedy were more than men. Maximus sacrificed himself for the sake of Rome. Not sense \\"Ben-Hur\\" has there been a great sandle movie. Harry say's this was a great film, he's right. This isn't an action film, it's about a man who must go threw the trials a tribulations to become a hero. Maximus should be compared to other notorious characters, like Travis Bickle, Rocky, and Don Corleone. \\"Gladiator also deserves to be compared to \\"Spartacus\\", \\"Braveheart\\", and \\"Ben-Hur.\\" I love this film, it's been 4 years sense it first came out, and the ending still touches me emotionaly. Bravo Russell Crowe, you deserved your Oscar.
B0002858YS|5.0|<br />Nowadays, it seems like there's a shortage of good music in the world. But out of the darkness rises the Las Vegas-based band The Killers. They bring new standards as to what rock should sound like, because they have their own unique sound. Now there's gonna be hundreds of other bands just like them, but they won't be as good, naturally. I've only had this album for a few days and it's gotten more plays than some of my other CDs, which doesn't happen often. The best tracks are definitely \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\", and I'm not just saying that because they're the lead singles. I hate when people say that. But for all you doubters out there, \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\" and \\"Andy, You're A Star\\" are also awesome tracks worth a listen. Now go buy it, you lazy bum.
0385337388|5.0|The House of God does a good job of highlighting the issues of iatrogenic morbidity and mortality in a fictional setting.<br /><br />I thought this was a great read and was anxious to talk about it with colleagues.  However, it seems many people, especially within the medical community, do not like to discuss the fact that medicine can and does harm people.  Discussing this novel with a classmate in a joking manner even got me sent to Dean's office during medical school.  In spite of all that, I will continue to recommend this novel to anyone interested in pursuing medicine as a career.<br /><br />Dr. Bergman has created a classic book of satire that makes the point that although medical education is getting better, patient care is getting worse.  I look forward to reading Mount Misery, which I understand is losely based on his training at McLean Hospital.<br /><br />Jason Begalke
B0002IQAD6|5.0|Okay, some of you have read my review for the Ready To Die CD elsewhere, and I am sorry. I was mad that day because of some reason and I took it out on Biggie. He's a good rapper and we all miss him. Sorry for any needs to kill me, guys. :)
B000089RVX|2.0|Dont get me wrong. This is good for starters, but PLEASE do not think that this is the best gothic metal band around.  <br />There are better bands out there that Evanescence have just ripped off, such as Lacuna Coil and Nightwish. Bands such as these deserve the REAL credit as being accomplished. And LC were there BEFORE Evanesence, so please talk some sense those people who constantly say that it's the other way around.  <br />This is an okay start, but for more diversity and symphonic metal, check out Lacuna Coil, Nightwish and Therion. Don't listen to those posers who slit their wrists and say, 'OMG! It says my suicide! OMG it's so gothic!' Because they're WRONG.
0783114893|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite horror movies.  Rutger Hauer is the title character, and he deserves a spot in the movie villainy hall of fame.  A lone driver on a deserted stretch of highway picks up a hitch hiker and a one way ticket to hell.<br /><br />Here's what is so scary about this movie-John Ryder's persistence.  Unrelenting horror really only applies to a handful of films and this movie is one of them.  From implied nastiness (\\"...because I cut off his legs, and his arms, and his head\\") to scenes of nerve shattering violence this is a movie you shouldn't watch before a road trip.<br /><br />Now here's the rub.  This dvd edition sucks donkeys.  Blue Underground or Anchor Bay need to step in and rectify the situation.  This is a classic that deserves classic treatment.  If you liked Steven Spielberg's Duel you'll love this movie.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Love Actually presents a series of charming tales underscoring the variety and persistence of love.  As the plot unfolds new love is contrasted with old love and lust with betrayal.  Some scenes are taken to believable excess but most remain in the romantic comedy reality.  If you watch closely I bet you find the love you have, the love you once had, or the love you long for.
0681658193|1.0|If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45. <br /> <br />All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.
B0002UOK04|5.0|Wintersun's 2004 self-titled debut is a monster Finnish melodic death record. Featuring Jari Maenpaa from Ensiferum on everything except drums, this Finnish duo sounds like another cousin (not clone) of Children of Bodom (a la Norther, Kalmah, Ensiferum, etc.), this band is incredible, with some very Laiho-like solos as well as some top-notch basslines. I haven't bought it yet, but I have listened to 2 full length tracks on the Nuclear Blast Germany website. I have viewed the video of opener \\"Beyond The Dark Sun,\\" and that song is one of the best opening tracks I've ever heard. I've also streamed track 2, \\"Winter Madness,\\" and it's a monster as well. Once I buy the album, I'll give you a full review.
B00005JNEI|1.0|\\"Oh, you have to see this movie, you're a lesser person to not see it.,\\" someone says.  Give me a break.  It's been a while since I played the \\"If you don't your a (...)..\\" playground game.  I feel like Moore sucked half my intelligence away with this trainwreck of a fiction piece wrapped in the \\"documentary\\" label that it ill deserves.  Here you go folks, DOCUMENTARY - Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter.  There's the definition, and whether or not you can bring yourself to understand this, Moore ignores the facts he doesn't like, and he is the king of editorializing.  So while this film contains some facts, it pulls them away from other facts and presents them in a way that leads you by your cattle-like nose ring to Moore's twisted view.  I'm not a Republican, I have the freedom of not believing any of the parties, so I can approach everything with doubt.  Do yourself a favor people, educate yourself, don't swallow what Moore shovels to you and call it the final truth.
B00005JMJG|3.0|If I were to write a review on the movie alone, I wouldn't hesitate to give it a four or five star rating.  However, this review is for the DVD presentation as well. <br /> <br />First, the movie.  The script, the performances, the direction, all brilliant and enjoyable.  I've been a big fan of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman since Being John Malkovich, and despite his inability to give his stories appropriate and satisfying endings, I think the end of Eternal Sunshine was a great improvement.  A creative genius. <br /> <br />The story said a lot to me, a lot I could relate to, about relationships and philosophy, thoughts that a lot of people believed only they would have, myself included.  It touches upon the old adage that without history, you're dooming yourself to repeat it.  But some histories are well worth repeating as demonstrated beautifully by the film. <br /> <br />My only problem is with the DVD presentation.  While it looks and sounds great, it doesn't have a lot of bonus features to offer.  There's the interesting commentary, a music video, a fake commercial for the fictional Lacuna services, a couple of shorts and a handful of deleted scenes.  While these are fine features for the price, it just isn't very much.  Directory Michel Gondry mentions coming very close to going overbudget and having shot a week's worth of film in a day.  Where is all this footage?  I'd like to know more about how this movie was made and I want to see more of what went on the cutting room floor.  The deleted scenes also need some commentary or at least a brief text description, so you know what context the scene was supposed to be in. <br /> <br />The overall presentation of the DVD just seems so very dull as well.  Completely static and silent menu screens, it seems like someone could've put together the DVD menus on their home PC.  It's a very dated-looking presentation.  I want to hear music from the movie, especially the main theme, during the menus, I want menus that lookmore than a website from 1994.  It's a simple lack of effort.  Also worth noting, as with most, if not all Universal DVD releases, is the annoying presence of a bunch of trailers for other Universal movies appearing as soon as you put the disc into your player.  You could bypass them, but you shouldn't have to skip something each and every time you want to watch. <br /> <br />For the money, this DVD is a good buy on the merits of the film alone.  Unless they release a special edition, I know I'll be watching this often.
0316168815|4.0|I found this book to be an easy and quick read although the subject matter is difficult. The story is told through the eyes of a young girl who has been murdered and is watching from heaven. It is a unique book that will make you cry!
B00005JMU2|4.0|I didn't go see this movie because I thought it would be Oscar worthy. I went because it looked cute and I am a sucker for the 'alls well that ends well' story. Don't expect a lot and you won't be disappointed. Katie Holmes does a great job, as does Marc Blucas. I love Michael Keaton, so enough said there. Very cute and fun.
B00005JNEI|5.0|When Michael Moore delivered his controversial acceptance speech after winning the Best Documentary prize for Bowling for Columbine at the 2003 Academy Awards, he lashed out at President George W. Bush and the fictious war in Iraq. Little did anyone know but Moore was also offering a teaser of his next film, Fahrenheit 9/11, a scathing attack on Bush, his link to the rich Saudi oil families, the \\"War on Terror\\" and the war currently raging in Iraq.<br /><br />Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Moore's documentary is that he puts a human face on the citizens of Iraq-something that the mainstream U.S. media has failed to do. He shows graphic footage of dead and maimed civilians killed by U.S. bombs and soldiers. He lets them speak and it becomes readily evident why many Iraqis hate America so much and why the mission to liberate them has so far failed. Moore also gives the U.S. soldiers a voice, interviewing several serving in Iraq and how some are clearly tired of fighting for people who don't want them there. Some soldiers who have come back home are also featured and they talk about their experiences and how their view of the war has changed. Moore also shows how the deaths of American soldiers have devastated their families with one woman in particular, Lila Lipscomb, whose story is quite compelling and resonates on a deeply emotional level.<br /><br />\\"Release of Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is an 11-minute featurette on the film's reception at the Cannes Film Festival. There is also footage of long line-ups and sold out screenings as the film made its way through the country.<br /><br />\\"Eyewitness Account from Samarra, Iraq\\" is an eyewitness account by Swedish journalist Urban Hamid on a U.S.-led raid in Samarra. There is incredible footage of U.S. soldiers arresting a man accused of funding insurgents that is narrated by Hamid himself.<br /><br />\\"Lila Lipscomb at Washington, D.C. Premiere\\" features comments from the woman that Moore talked with in the documentary and whose son died in Iraq. She delivers an impassioned speech at the film's premiere.<br /><br />Finally, there are seven additional scenes of footage, including interviews with more average Iraqis on the streets of Baghdad on the eve of the 2003 U.S. invasion. Also included is more with Corporal Abdul Henderson and his experiences in Iraq and a very funny segment with Arab-American comedians doing routines about the \\"War on Terror\\" and how they are persecuted on a daily basis.<br /><br />Fahrenheit 9/11 is an incendiary zeitgeist movie that taps right into what is currently happening on our political landscape. It is an angry blast, a howling protest movie against a Presidency clearly out of touch with what is really going on. It is a brilliant film for these troubled times and is what every American, be they Democrat, Republican or undecided, should see before they vote in November.ary and whose son died in Iraq.

B00005JNEI|1.0|A documentary can have a point of view, it cannot present 59 lies as the truth, By definition this is not a documentary but it is propaganda; and its a shame people will see this and think its the gospel truth. There is plenty of criticism one can put on the Bush Administration on, but believing in these \\"black helicopter\\" conspiracy theories, just puts one out on the fridge. Lets just take one example. We invaded Afghanistan so we can build a pipeline. Well, we have been in there three years now and NO PIPELINE is being built. The truth is two company's back in the mid 90s considered building a pipeline in Afghanistan, the Clinton administration even helped one of the company's by talking with the Taliban about it. But it never came off. if was considered unfeasible and not worth it. So its a lie by Mr. Moore. I can document all 59 lies (Which include rearranging of an article, misplacing Video as to date of events, and manipulating Video to the point that fact becomes fiction), but suffice it to say, if a witness is wrong on one materiel fact, they you must or may distrust all his \\"facts.\\"  I do not begrudge anyone from seeing this film, but also seek out alternatives such as Fahrenhype 911 and Celsius 41:11 Also see what John McCain has to say abort disingenuous film makers.

B00005JNEI|4.0|\\"All art is propaganda; not all propaganda is art.\\" - George Orwell    ...and in my opinion, Michael Moore's timely screed *Fahrenheit 9/11* is Art with a capital A, a near-masterpiece of skewed filmmaking in the fine tradition of *Triumph of the Will* and *Birth of a Nation*, though far more left-leaning than its predecessors.  Composed, with almost equal ratio, of damning evidence and below-the-belt circus antics; dripping with well-deserved contempt for the Bush administration; smothered with borderline-exploitative pathos and bookended by a shellshocked white-liberal's politik angst: *Fahrenheit 9/11* is immensely entertaining and highly relevant in our spin-era, and a must see for any self-respecting liberal (affirmation after affirmation for the leftest paradigm), neo-con (c'mon! Know thy Enemy, yaas?) and film-student alike.         To be honest, I'm highly ambivalent of Michael Moore as a \\"journalist,\\" or, for that matter, a social critic.  Nor am I affiliated with one of the two political juntas that currently split the U.S.A in two: to give this review a proper perspective, let's just say I'm one of those \\"moderates\\" despised by both camps for not kowtowing to the prevalent rhetoric of-the-moment.  And yet, the talent that composed *Fahrenheit 9/11* cannot be denied - this man knows how to push buttons.  Scruffy and slovenly, Moore's working-class faade contrasts that of his contemporaries (Huff n' Puff blowhard Bill O'Reilly, Oxycotin spokesman Limbaugh, the pathologically perverse enigma that is Ann Coulter), but the essentials of media-manipulation remain steadfast - selective information coupled with highly-skilled editing tricks; shameless pandering; carnival-barker crowd theatrics ... but while his contemporaries tend to shovel all of the tribulations of modern society on the catch-phrase explicate \\"liberal\\" - lowest common denominator ad hominem expressed in the most blas manner possible - Moore's focus here is centered upon the figurehead, the cowboy in control, the inexplicable but all too real joke that is the DUBYA.      \\"Was it all a dream?\\" Moore wonders at the beginning of the film, tickling a major sore-spot for his core audience with scenes from the 2000 election fiasco.  I have to admit that it's a guilty pleasure watching Moore take on Bush Co. with both barrels loaded and plenty of ammunition to spare; and although 9/11's cut n' paste technique is often misleading (yes, I've read the 56 deceits page), the material in itself is a damning enough portrait of greed, corruption, hubris, Wizard of Oz stylized fear-tactics, base stupidity...it's all here, folks, in voluptuous quantity.      And the music cues - oh, those music cues! - Moore displays as deft a sense at the mixing board as at the editing equipment, and the result is, at times, flat-out hilarious. Bush and family cavorting at the ranch and golf course to down-home country jams - gut busting! Bush's service record underscored by a few bars of Eric Clapton's 'Cocaine' - lip-quivering!  Sinister Arabic music, reminiscent of a villain theme for a James Bond flick, to introduce a rather offensive Saudi Arabian Bush Co. connection - sheer genius! The use of sound is not just confined to the humorous, however.  The black-screen treatment of 9/11, complete with screams and destructive rumbling, is highly effective, and I was surprised Moore showed restraint and did not include footage of the dual impact or the suicide-jumpers.  The burning of Baghdad is underscored by the dirge n' strum of a soldier's favorite carnage-score: the result is jaw-dropping, a horrific example of psychological triune-stroke to motivate battle-heat; when juxtapositioned with the burnt, mutilated Iraqi corpses, it inspired in me both nausea - for the brutality of life; and admiration - for the artistic will composting the film. *Fahrenheit 9/11* continued on, relentless, thoroughly exposing Bush Co. as a plutocratic nightmare to the concept of democracy; and my outburstsof laughter at the antics became edged with a growing hysteria-tone - for this absurd theater was/is all too real, not to mention readily and rabidly defended by the meme-drenched Republican masses.    Moore does fumble from time to time.  Certain segments went on too long, the African-American representative reaction being a prominent example.  The patriotic mother/slain child segment also occupied a bit too much of the running time, despite it remaining the heart of the film and its most melodramatic example of Bush Co. betrayal.  My major beef with the film, however (thus the reduction of one star) is that Moore barely scratches at the surface in regards to some of the subjects he brings up: *Fahrenheit 9/11* can easily be seen as a liberal-slander greatest hits package, with all of the accusation and little of the depth.  Still, I know Art when I see it, and Farenhight 9/11 fits the bill.  Big time.  It's status as perhaps _the_ watercooler film of the year (alongside the Catholic Guilt Catharsis of certain other independent 2004 release), when coupled with its explosive success and critical timing, is testament enough. F 9/11 is the most important film released in 2004.      Highly recommended.
B0000630BT|5.0|Limp Bizkit...Slipknot....metal!?!  Maybe after you turn 15, your mom will let you buy some REAL metal.  I'll give you a few bands to check out:  Death, Opeth, JUDAS PRIEST, Maiden, Children of Bodom, oh heck, maybe some more Priest.  Thing is, without this atari game music, as you put it, none of those bands on your list, and none of the ones on mine, would even exist.  Not only that, they've written more classic metal than any of your bands.  You may not like it, that's fine, but at least get your facts straight about what's real METAL, and what you listen to.   <br /> <br />Now as for this album...freakin' great.  Every song on there, with the possible exception of \\"Metal Meltdown\\" and \\"Battle Hymn,\\" are absolute classics, and even those are pretty awesome.  This is Priest at their heaviest.  Scott Travis' drumming added so many new dimensions to the band.  Probably the only drawbacks to this album, besides the two songs I mentioned before, are that the lyrics are...pretty cheesy.  But that's alright, lyrics have never been Rob's thing, and he's at his best here.  Besides, how much modern non-mainstream metal has decent, intelligable lyrics anyways?   <br /> <br />Bottom line:  If you like real metal, you probably already have this album anyways.  If you want to get into real metal, this is as good a place as any to start.
0786915749|5.0|This first book in the wonderful Dragonlance Chronicles Trilogy introduces a world that people have come to truly love.  The world of Krynn has given rise to what must be a hundred novels that loyal fans gobble up.  This loyalty is inspired mainly by these first three books in the saga, starting with Dragons of Autumn Twilight.  It was the first Dragonlance book I read (as it should be everyone's) and it is the one I will always remember most vividly.  The introduction of some of the coolest characters in fatasy literature and their crazy adventures through a new and unique world fighting draconians, goblins, and dragons.  Tas, Flint, Tanis, Caramon, Sturm, Raistlin, Goldmoon, and Riverwind will always be the classic fantasy heroes to me, whom I can compare and relate heroes from other books.  These characters are not the unrealistically superhero-like and unstoppable players like in some other books (Drizzt for example) but are instead very life-like (as far as fantasy goes) with some pretty major faults of their own.<br /><br />It is interesting to see how the writing style of Weis and Hickman has changed over the years and its obvious that in this first collaborative book they tried very hard to stick to the AD&D format which actually might take some good away from this first book of the series.  Overall though, this book and this series is one of the greatest fantasy stories I've ever read and has become a classic that every fantasy fan should read.
B00006AFUR|5.0|The music on this album is something like I've never heard before.  I am very picky about music, but when I do find something I like, I really like it.  Thats how I am about 30stm.  This cd is heavy, yet comfortable and relaxing.  I don't get a headache from it.  The music contains a very space, universe, organic feeling to it.  If you enjoy sitting in a comfy chair and doing nothing but listening to music, this is a great album to get...its just that entertaining.  This is music for enjoying alone in your home.  Its good for cruising around town in your car with.  Its good for your headphones while relaxing on the beach.  It would make excellent ambiant music in a dimmly lit planetarium or imax dome theater.  This album is where its at.  I love it.
B000002UAU|5.0|Brilliant album, totally psychedelic and beautiful. My favourite song is A Day In The LIfe its amazing. This album was extrememly influential but not actually as infleuntial as people give it credit for. For example, it is often credited as being the first ever concept album which isnt true as Frank Zappa's Freak Out was released over a year earlier which is absolutley mind blowing when u compare it to the other music of the time. Paul even admits to getting the idea for sgt peppers from Freak Out. Still its such a good album, buy it now <br /> <br />Oh yeah, Robert Warmington, you're a fool. This album is amazing but it is not the only good album ever as you seem to claim. Pink Floyd, Can, Radiohead, Frank Zappa, Miles Davis, Aphex Twin and King Crimson are all more influential than this album and you can't deny this because you probly don't have a clue who most of these bands are cos if you did you'd know how good they are
1400031354|5.0|You have to read this book just to know the poignant symbolism of the title! I thoroughly enjoyed this book; it was clever in all parts.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|It's a tad understated and I have no problem with that.  I need to find more time to listen to it.
037542217X|4.0|The book picks up where the third installment left us, the faithful readers of this great series. However, the author fails to clue is in to what depression it was that Matekoni had. Makutsis begins a typing school for men for extra money and it is a hit.<br /><br />Another clever book by McCall but really thought there were parts missing that would have helped the reader end the book better.
B00005JMJG|5.0|<br />Every moment I hear Jim Carrey is going to star in a new movie, I sit back and attempt at figuring out what exactly it is the going is going to do next. Sure we all know him as that goofball who has starred in big-profit comedies but there is that other side to Jim Carrey, that side which allows him to star in some of the most absurd movies. I think Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one such case.  <br /> <br />Ok so maybe Michel Gondry did have one real bad mess-up, it was a little film entitled \\"Human Nature\\" but in spite of that hiccup, I came across a phenomenal DVD from Palm Pictures called \\"The Work of Director Michel Gondry\\". Within the packaging of that DVD, you'll find a treasure trove of cool music videos, T.V. ads and various other little goodies. You know there are some who say Hollywood has just about run dry of really good ideas and is bled of the art of magnificant storytelling, replaced instead by sex, violence and well gimmick special effects. But than I realize, this problem is a result of brilliant director Charlie Kaufman, who has secretly stored in his cranium all sorts of really buzz kill movie ideas. This is the same sly, smart and sagacious guy who gave us such movies like Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. You take one young and energetic director (Michel Gondry), pair him up with the arcane and seasoned vet (Charlie Kuafman), and they weave together a playful script and nab a wide assortment of established actors/actresses. There are loads of great performances from Jim Carey, Kate Winslet to Mark Ruffalfo and Elijah Wood, heck even the ebullient Kirsten Dunst is in present form, offering perhaps her best career acting job.  <br /> <br />I think anyone who gives too much of the plot is a total fool, there are just so many sparkling moments here, they can only be cherished if you see them yourself instead of hearing or reading someone else describe about them. But the general plot goes like this, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) enjoy a brief but beautiful relationship with one another, until one day they have a nasty argument which ends their courting together. Clementine then visits Lacuna Corporation to have all her memories of Joel zapped dry from her memory. When Joel remembers his former lover cannot even remember him, the desperate dope goes off to have the same procedure done on him. When the process is being done on his mind by two techies Ruffalo and Wood, about halfway through it he starts to realize that he still loves her. About 3/4 of the movie is spent crawling around scene-by-scene in Joels' mind, these scenes shuffle by presenting moments of comedy so quirky that one can't help but put a grin on their face to moments full of sadness and bittersweet emotions. I will not go on because that in itself would be a real crime, but needless to say the colorful illustrations of our dynamic duo of directors becomes extremely clear.  <br /> <br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is clever, so off-kilter and supremely satisfying that it acts as a testament to what powerful movie making is all about. It also demonstrates just how much film makers and future ones to come, can brim with a little bit of HOPE, knowing that there is still is plenty of imagination to infuse within their little craft. This is hands down one of the most entertaining and original movies I've seen in quite sometime. Just the fact alone that it's sole concentration is on character development and story makes it already uniquely different from all those big-time blockbusters roaming out there.  <br /> <br />Go see this movie.  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Moore's film, an exercise in political spin, was obviously inspired by the political manipulations of one Karl Rove, Bush's political guru and master of double-speak.  There has been a lot of hue and cry about Moore's political ax to grind and this film wears it on its sleeve.  There is no doubt that Moore despises everything Bush stands for and that is the beauty of the film -- its unambiguous disgust at the current administration and their web of lies and deceit. <br /> <br />Granted, Moore pushes the envelope in terms of making his points.  Some of his facts are indeed somewhat exaggerated and the juxtoposition of imagery is obviously manipulated to reinforce his points.  But that's OK with me. <br /> <br />After watching hours of Bush's political spin and mischaracterization of Senator Kerry's record, statements and war record, I find it amazing that the Republicans find their own medicine distasteful when it's delivered from the other side.   <br /> <br />Buy this DVD and watch it.  Distill it down 50% and you will still end up disgusted by the lies of the Bush administration and the dangerous path they are taking this country down.  Oh, and if you're reading this (and watching the DVD) Mr. Rove, I hope you're enjoying Moore's appropriation of your hatchet political style!  If anyone deserves it, it's you.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is my first Radiohead cd.  I only bought it because my local big-box store had it on sale along with alot of other music I Knew was good.  I'd read all kinds of reviews raving about radiohead but, hey, I'm an old guy and I'm not going to waste my money on some New Thing.  But this cd is very good.  To me it sounds kind of like David Byrne singing in front of Pink Floyd.  It can be hauntingly, hypnotically, melodic with an almost opera-like drama and then BAM instant wakeup in a future techno nightmare.  An album to listen to in its entirety.
B000067J1Y|4.0|A hilarious movie, made moreso by the fact that the acting and plot are universally better than what you'd find in the object of it's spoofing, \\"Top Gun.\\" The film is loaded with Abrahams's usual sight-gags, puns, slapstick, and quick wordplay. There's always something going on in the background, making for fun repeat viewings. The overall cheesiness of the special effects really adds to the overall experience. Besides that, it's educational, too! You'll never again wonder what a chafing dish is.
B00005NGZX|5.0|I could go on and on, repeating what has already been said about this astonishing piece of work, but I won't. Simply, download the song 'Jane Doe', listen to it and fall in love with this band. If you don't, then this was not made for you.
6305127689|1.0|Quite possibly the most blatantly homoerotic film made that didn't involve Joel Schumacher, \\"Top Gun\\" is a constant comparison of genital size, interrupted by moments of bad dialogue and stilted acting. It lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety or intelligent scripting, opting instead for a lame, convoluted plot, obviously forced emotion, and love scenes completely devoid of any romance or eroticism. How any post-pubescent human being can enjoy this grand whizzing contest is beyond me.
0679720200|4.0|The Stranger tells the story of Meursault, a man who seems aimless in life and has stopped noting his feelings.  Events that would seem major to others do not effect him in any emotional way.  When his mother dies, he is not saddened in the least bit, and goes on a date the day after her funeral.  When he becomes involved in the dangerous affairs of an amoral pimp named Raymond, Meursault's fate takes a turn for the worst.  He eventually commits a pointless murder, and faces the possibility of having to face the worst consequence possible; execution. <br />  The simple narrative of this novel parallels the theme of existentialism, and the pointlessness of life.  This book definetely requires reading between the lines, so it is not for everyone.  Some also believe that the author's outlook on life highly influences the novel, while I believe that it does not hinder the potency of the message. <br />
B00005JNEI|4.0|I can honestly say, that just by seeing the film from start to finish, I can say that Michael Moore must have shown a lot of guts when it came to making this film.  It is easy to understand why many people would simply hate this film (they would call it lies, deceit, B.S., etc.).  But to those who hate this film without even seeing it, that is where I would have to draw a line.  <br /> <br />I did not like the film totally (I felt that there were too many cheap shots at Bush and company), but I do give him points for how he presents his information (if he says that he has people who check the facts he presents, then anything from those facts COULD be true).  This film does show that this is America, where we have a right to express our opinions, in the hopes that those opinions would never be suppressed by anyone.  Like I said, I don't agree with everything that Michael Moore says, but it is a good film.  Whether it's disputed truth or disputed propaganda, that decision is up to you.
B00005JN7O|3.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow was a ok movie. It was weird. It was like the 1930s from the future. There was so much weird stuff it was stupid. There was a World War 2 type plane that looked like a Mustang and then it changed into a submarine. There was also a flying airfield. The special effects was really good. If you like weird stuff you shoud watch this movie.
B0000584V3|5.0|You know those one-star reviews this cd has been getting? Don't pay any attention to them. Those morons obviously know nothing about music. Seriously, if you don't like the music then fine, but saying that the losers of Good Charlotte are better song writers? If I was God, I'd smite you with a lightening bolt for saying something so incoherently stupid. So unless your review is pure sarcasm, shut the hell up.  <br /> <br />So anyways. . . about the cd. This is my first Opeth album, so I'm a little new to the band. I didn't like it that much at first, but now that I'm used to it I love it. It shifts from this extreme metal to  some very beautiful and eloquent classical guitar. And so what if the singer growls? In fact, this is one of the only bands I listen to where the singer growls. This is, simply put, great music.  <br /> <br />If you're someone who wants to only listen to what MTV tells you to listen to, then stay away from this. However, if you want to do yourself a favor and hear great music, then listen to Opeth.

B0002OERI0|5.0|ok, green day has never been \\"punk\\". even they admit they arent anything hardcore so dont treat them as such, they're just a fun band with good songs...kind of like how NOFX isnt \\"hardcore\\" but just really funny, hense why they are awesome. ever since 39/smooth green day has been evolving and changing and this is where they went. american idiot is a friggen awesome record...i was worried because Warning, while not all bad, was definatly not the green day i love.  with american idiot they've gone back in the direction id like to see them go and i say go buy this album because its definatly worth it. if you're new to GD then go get their old albums too...nimrod is their hardest, insomniac is great no matter what anyone says, dookie...who the hell hasnt heard of it, kerplunk (yes they had albums before dookie) still has a sort of raw garage band sound and 39/smooth....GD at their best. <br /> <br />and to the hardcore punk guy that was all upiddy about hardcore punk back in the 80's...dude... \\"SLC: Punk\\", watch it. <br /> <br />other great punk bands (not all of them so dont freak out on me): NOFX, Anti-flag, Bad Religion, Distillers, Rancid, (Int)NC, Downset, Dropkick Murphys, AFI, and the Vandals.  check some of them out if you havent already.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Astonishingly moving and uplifting drama about a successful banker (Tim Robbins) who wrongfully receives two back-to-back life sentences for a double homicide.  He befriends inmate Red (Morgan Freeman) and a few others at Shawshank prison.  It's also astonishing that as I write this review I realize that even its basic synopsis would make it difficult to sell someone on seeing this movie.  This is simply more proof that a film can withstand the test of time and garner a status as ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICAN FILMS without needing a marketable title, marketable premise, or bankable director and actors.  The Shawshank Redemption spread like wildfire by good old-fashioned word-of-mouth.  It became a phenomenon back in 1994, and here it is again, on an impressive 2-disc DVD Special Edition.  Imdb.com's readers have voted this the second best movie of all time, behind only The Godfather.  That's pretty impressive company right there. <br />I wonder if the feeling I had when I first viewed the movie is similar to others'.  I felt during the first act that this would be just another prison drama, formulaic and trite.  Then by the onset of the third act, I was completely engrossed by phenomenal acting and directing, unexpected friendships by the characters, and a satisfying finale (don't worry, I didn't give away anything). <br />See it for yourself.  You won't regret it.

B0002HTZJI|1.0|The only problem i have with this cd is they dont go back to the Old Red Hot Chili Peppers, which much of the fans want to hear. The funk rock sound has been lost during the course of the Chili Peppers career, and buying this cd has made me realize that nothing good can come from the new Chili's, they will only sink further down into the pit of pop rock, and will never be heard by older fans of the Chili peppers. This proves true with the release of By the way and the newest release of Live in Hyde.
B00005JKC3|4.0|The Hulk is obviously based off a comic book, and happens to be, in my opinion, the best comic book based movie made. I thought Spider-man was okay(3 stars worthy) as well as the sequal. X-men was okay. Same thing as Spider-man, but I liked this one better. <br /> <br />It was very dark. Had a lot to do with Bruce Banner's strange past. Involving the death of his mother and his father being commited and all.  <br /> <br />The movie begins with a slow start. Showing the events that lead to his teen age and his adult age, where he is a scientist working on regeneration. He eventually he gets hit by gamma radiation and unleashes the monster within him. <br /> <br />One night, when Banner(still called Krensler) is working late. He gets pissed, and the Hulk comes out. Creates a mess and leaves. This is where the movie picks up. Gets more exciting. <br /> <br />A lot of people didn't like the whole, slowly revealing the past thing, but I did. I think, if you're going to have a mysterious past, then you should reveal it very slowyly, and keep the audience guessing a little. <br /> <br />There is one thing I did not like, and that was the comic book feel. I didn't like it in the beginning, but halfway through the movie you'll get used to it and actually begin adapting to it. Getting used to it. <br /> <br />I don't like comic books. So I don't care if they change a lot of facts from the comic book. Once again, I judge a movie on how entertaining it is. Not on how close it is to whatever it is it's based off of. <br /> <br />By the way, this was better than better Spider-man 2.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This man always could move you with his song. If I had to pick a song of his that I always enjoyed it would be Georgia. I heard it sung recently at Trumps' Casino in Atlantic City by Michael Buble and what a fitting tribute to one of the greatest artists of our time. Ray Charles was a master.
0790744295|3.0|That crappy director George A. Romero, partners up with writer Stephan King to create fun semi-fright fest. <br /> <br />It's a movie composed of many shorts movies. One involving a zombie after his father's day cake. Another involvig a meteor and a lonely guy(which seems to be the same idea that \\"Evolution\\" had). A story about a man getting some revenge against a few of his enemies. A story about a monster-filled crate, and a story about a man and cockroaches. <br /> <br />All them pretty funny. Had a few moments that would make you jump, but overall, it was only good. Did not find it very exciting, but I was sitting at a wierd angle when I saw it, so I don't know. If I was looking head on it might have been different. <br /> <br />By the way. It's not very scary.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|To the Michael and his producers/editors of this dvd:  <br />YOU DESERVE ACCOLADES. BRILLIANT DVD. <br />I was transported immediately and given an incredibly honest and personal look into my favorite singers life and world. <br />The mix of black and white photography with color images, and the unique joining of concerts worldwide is flawless. Add to that the velvet vocals of Michael Buble and his spontaneous, warm and funny repore with his audiences worldwide, it's the most enjoyable music dvd I've ever owned. <br />Now enjoying it for probably the tenth time I can say with some authority that it is a MUST HAVE FOR YOUR COLLECTION!
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Kind of a shock if you havn't seen this movie yet as either everyone that was a teen in the 80's or 90's have seen this movie and also its on cable like every saturday. But in case you havn't the setup of the movie is 5 kids are stuck together on a saturday detention for something they did which we learn about what they did later. The thing is, none of them are friends at all! In fact they are all in different cliqs and such are somewhat against each other. We have the jock, the princess, the badboy, the nerd, and of course, the psychopath (or the weirdo as shes called). This movie deals with everyday problems involving all these characters and the differences between them. While dealing with each other they have to deal with the strict overbearing principle stuck watching them. In the end they find out alot about each other and alot about themselves as well. A great classic movie that is timeless and really a must see if you havn't seen it. The DVD version is kinda funny though (I bought it with a 3 pack) as it really is just a copy from the tape as you can tell from the quality. One day when they need more sales they'll probably remake the DVD with better quality and sound and charge double the price, but for now we have this one and still its a keeper.
B000088E6D|5.0|Like the legends before him, Mr. Buble has that uncanny ability to \\"take hold\\" of the listener/viewer and sooth their souls! <br /> <br />This album is phenomenal, Buble's charasmatic sound is like none I've heard before and leaves me yearning for more - much more. I loved his duet on Jane Monheit's fine album, and really enjoyed watching him play himself on the television series \\"Las Vegas\\" that aired last night. What a gorgeous and talented man. <br />
B00005V9IK|5.0|How amazing that when this movie first came out, it was the greatest special effects and the most talked about movie at the time. granted its no Titanic, but still it pushed the special effects to the limit at that time (yes there were decent special effects before Matrix). OK enough with the griping, if you've never seen this movie then heres the concept. Aliens come and take over all the major cities in the world and start to destroy them. It's up to the United States (yeah of course it focuses on us in the U.S. no offense to anyone in another country) to mount a rescue with people from different cultures to figure a way to stop the invasion. When an idea is brought up, the world gets together and celebrates its own Independance Day. A pretty decent movie and a good sci-fi at that.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore's Masterpiece on the 9/11 disaster is something every American should see!  This is a movie based entirely on the truth and what has been going on in the American Government over the past 3 and a half years plus.  I get a kick out of people who say this movie is all about lies and false statements.  Let me ask, how can Mr. Moore make a movie loaded with lies when you see the actual people, Mr. Bush included, making the statements and going through the actual motions.  There is no film making trickery in this movie at all.  Every word out hear and person you see is as it is happening.  Why did it take Mr. Bush over 7 minutes to do something after he heard the 1st plane hit the World Trade Center?    <br /> <br />This is a must have DVD.  Every American should see this movie  before the November election.  If you are in doubt at all on who to vote for, check this DVD out.  I am sure your mind will reach a decision within 2 hours if not sooner!
B00006879E|1.0|The first time I listened to This Love, I was like WOW! Best song ever. Then I heard She Will Be Loved, good song too. Then Harder To Breathe, and I ran out to buy this. But I was greatly disappointed. Except for the 3 singles, the CD is plain BAD and repetitive. The CD enraged me, how come could it get so bad? And then they got commercial and did crappy videos that make me and my brother mad. I'm sorry for these guys, they should have tried harder. <br />P.S. I gave this disc to my friend's girlfriend. Of course, she only listens to 4 tracks.
068987474X|5.0|At last. A book that tells it like it is. I'm so tired of seeing women turn themselves inside out wondering what they need to do to \\"land a husband\\", like he's a 200-pound trout. Change your hair, change your clothes, change your face, send different signals, develop a talent for mesmerism, hang out at the Ferrari dealership, spend every night at the local sports bar ... Give me a break. That's so insulting to women AND to men. Like women should be expected to compromise themselves constantly to lure a guy in, and like men are so dumb that we'll fall for it. This book is so refreshing because it recognizes a simple truth: Girls, there will always be some guys who JUST DON'T LIKE YOU - NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. That's not an insult. It's just a plain biological fact. Finding \\"the one\\" isn't about making a marital wish list and going shopping. That pretty thing in the window is a human being, actually: he has tastes, he has preferences, he has his own idea of \\"the one\\" he's looking for. And if he ain't beating down your door, then it probably isn't you. But so what? That doesn't mean you're inferior. It doesn't mean you're doomed to be single forever. Just move on. Keep looking. Would you REALLY want to spend the rest of your life with a guy that doesn't like you?
B0000AQVCL|3.0|The first 4 songs, and Cold Hard B***** make the album alone. The rest is just filler. My fav has got to be \\"Look What You've Done.\\" Listen to the 5 songs I listed above and you'll have a great rock n' roll album. Bye gotta go to the bathroom XD

6304169558|5.0|In this movie, Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play scientists pursuing the most destructive weatherfront to sweep through mid-America's tornado alley in 50 years. <br /> <br />Helen Hunt stars as Jo Harding, a weather scientist who, as a young girl saw her father sucked up inside a tornado.  It is Jo's dream to develop electronic storm sensors which can be launched inside the tornado to provide data to create an improved weather warning system.  Bll Paxton stars as Bill Harding, Jo's estranged husband.  He's brought divorce papers for Jo to sign.  However, there still seems to be a spark between the two.  Both serverd as storm chasers together.  Bill has brought his uptight and jealous fiance Melissa, played wonderfully by Jami Gertz.  Melissa doesn't fit in very well with the storm chasers.  Bill is now a weatherman, having given up the stormchasing business. <br /> <br />Jo shows Bill \\"Dorothy\\", her storm sensor system which launches sensors inside a tornado.  Bill is the one who designed Dorothy originally.  The sensors bring back data such as windspeed and velocity.  The early warning system could give people as much as 15 minutes to reach safety, Jo theorizes. <br /> <br />Soon, the group is off chasing a storm, and Bill, realizing that he forgot his signed divorce papers, is tagging along.  The group soon encounters Jonas Miller, played by Cary Elwes, a fellow stormchaser from the same lab who received help from corporate sponsors.  Bill believes that Jonas is only in the business for the money and he refers to him as a \\"nightcrawler with no instincts\\".  Jonas and his group are chasing the same storm as Jo's group.  Jonas has developed his own storm system sensor called the Dot 3.  It is almost an exact copy of Dorothy.  The race is on to see who's system will work first. <br /> <br />A tornado is spotted, and Bill and Jo race to place Dorothy in its path, at the same time being pursued by Jonas.  Despite their arguing, Bill and Jo seem to be rekindling their romance, while Bill and Melissa are drifting further apart.  The storm flings Jo's truck into the middle of the road, destroying Dorothy, but there are still three Dorothys left.  Jonas shows up too late.  Soon, Dorothy 2 is loaded in Bill's truck, and the chase is on again. <br /> <br />Another tornado is spotted, but this one is much larger than the first.  Dorothy 2 is positioned, but unfortunately a telephone pole falls on it and destroys it.  Only two Dorothys are left. <br /> <br />Another tornado appears practically on top of the group, who have parked near a drive-in movie.  The tornados are increasing in strength, and it launches its wrath on the drive-in.  Soon, cars and other debris is hurtling through the air.  The storm passes, but the drive-in is completely destroyed.  Jo realizes that the tornado has shifted and is headed directly for her aunt's house.  Melissa, realizing that she can't compete with Jo and her crew, informs Bill that she's leaving him.  Jo and Bill reach Jo's aunt and rescue her from her destroyed house. <br /> <br />Another stronger tornado is forming and is said to be the strongest ever in the area.  Jo and Bill are off in pursuit.  What the group encounters is a massive funnel with a base one mile wide.  Dorothy 3 is placed in the middle of the highway, but a large tree knocks Dorothy over.  Now there's only one Dorothy left. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Jonas and his group have shown up again.  They are placing their own Dot 3 machine.  Jo and Bill try to warn Jonas that the tornado may shift, but unfortunately for Jonas' group, they ignore the warning. <br /> <br />Bill leaves Dorothy 4 in the back of his truck, Bill and Jo jump out, and the tornado picks up the truck with Dorothy in it.  Much to their joy, Dorothy works just as she was designed to, but the danger isn't over yet.  Bill and Jo find themselves facing the wrath of the tornado on foot.  Facing gale-force winds and flying farm buildings, Bill and Jo finally take cover in a shed, tied to pipes that reach far down into the ground.  The storm passes and Bill and Jo begin planning their future research as a couple again. <br /> <br />This is an excellent movie.  Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt do wonderful jobs, and Jami Gertz is teriffic as Melissa.  The high point of the movie is the top-notch special effects.  They are some of the best I've ever seen.  The tornado scenes are extremely realistic.  My favorite scenes were when the semi truck loaded with diesel fuel came hurtling out of the tornado and exploded on the road, and the scene where Bill drove the pickup through the house.  I highly recommend this thrilling and action-packed movie.  The special effects will keep you on edge, and you may even learn something about tornadoes along the way.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|To quote a previous reviewer who gave this movie a poor rating: <br /> <br />\\"They smoke cigarettes together. They drink. They smirk. They look out of the window. They stare into space. They don't even have sex (thanks mercy!).\\" <br /> <br />This, right here, is an inadequate viewer. They are obviously looking more towards the sex aspect (or the thankful lack thereof) and doesn't get any of the meaning in the movie. <br /> <br />Yes, if you have a short attention span this movie probably isn't for you. No action is during the movie, no amazing plot twists or backstabbing characters. This is a movie quite possibly in its purest and most brilliant form, one that explores its character's emotions as you feel the same along with them. <br /> <br />And I would like everyone to know, I'm not trying to sound pretentious arthouse-snob here. I like a huge range of movies, it just makes me angry when people post on here they didn't like the movie because they didn't get any of it. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for one of the few non-cliched love stories, and probably the best love story of our time.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|The fact that Dream Theater is one of the most amazing bands recording today goes without saying, so I would rather comment on the technical aspects DVD itself. The quality of the production is OUTSTANDING. A little disappointed in thier last DVD offering (understandable because of the age of the material), this outing delivers in a ridiculous fashion. Video quality is as good as DVD gets and it is WIDESCREEN!! The camera work is excellent with a good deal of focus on the hands of the musicians as they play the more intricate parts of the songs. The voice track lacks at times, but that's hardly a distraction and is often better. This has the look of a music video than a simple taped concert. As for the bonus disk...unbelievable!! The documentary is top-notch and gives a great insight into the band on-tour. Mike's drum solo is insane, of course. Overall this must be one of the best music DVDs ever produced.
B0000C8AV3|4.0|This is Bob Dylan for late at night. You've just gotten home after a long, pleasent evening and you are tired. You wanna listen to some music. How about Bob Dylan? Nah, don't wanna get to riled up right now...Put on Infidels. It is the 'chillest' Dylan out there (at least that I know of). When you don't want to think (Highway 61 Revisited), don't want to experiment (Another Side of Bob Dylan/Self Potrait) this is great.<br /><br />Three best songs:<br /><br />3: I and I. Very chill, reggae-ish. I'm looking forward to the version on \\"Is It Rolling, Bob?\\" the Dylan reggae tribute.<br /><br />2. Jokerman. Ultimate relaxation right here. Jokerman dance...<br /><br />1. Neighborhood Bully. A true rocker. The one way this album reminds me of that underappreciated (at least in my opinion) Dylan album Shot of Love is that they both have one song that everyone must agree rocks. \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" is that song.
0380002930|5.0|I first read Watership Down when I started high school some 25 years ago.  I read it again every few years  <br /> <br />One of the great things about the novel is that it can be read on a number of levels based on the readers age and understanding.  I appreciated aspects of the novel at age 30 that I missed when I was 15. <br /> <br />Watership Down is, first and foremost, an adventure tale about a bunch of rabbits trying to find a new warren and the friendships that develop during the quest.  This alone makes it a great tale.   <br /> <br />Yet, it is also a political novel looking at and exploring the dangers of different types of governments.  It is also a novel about faith and mythmaking and the importance of both in life.    <br /> <br />In short this is a novel that reaches people at many different levels.  Most of all it keeps me young. <br /> <br />
B0002KVULG|3.0|I saw an airing of this on tv (way back when!) that was a filming of the stage production.  It was probably the best version of Dracula I've seen, so when I ran across this on LD years ago, I was ecstatic to get it, only to be disappointed that it was nowhere near the experience.  It's probably still my favorite Dracula rendition, and I'm planning on getting the DVD, but I'd really rather get the stage production version...

0425129608|4.0|The beautiful and flirtatious Arlena Stewart is holidaying in the South West Coast of England with her husband, Captain Marshall and her stepdaughter Linda, staying at the Jolly Roger Hotel on an exclusive island. There she carries out a not too discreet affair with the handsome Patrick Redfern, husband of poor quiet Christine Redfern. Amongst the hotel guests are an American couple, a retired priest, a longwinded army chap, a spinster, a female friend of Captain Marshall and Hercule Poirot.<br /><br />One bright sunny morning, Arlena is found dead, strangled at Pixy Cove. Hercule Poirot and the local police are called in to investigate the matter. Could the jealous husband have murdered her or perhaps it was the long suffering wife. Could it be that Arlena was blackmailed by some unscrupulous cad? Could she have stumbled across a smuggling operation at the cove? Hercule Poirot fits the pieces of the puzzle together. Amongst the clues are a pair of scissors found at the scene of the crime, pieces of a green calendar and wax in the fire grate in one of the guests rooms, an empty bottle thrown out of a window, the sound of bath water draining from a tub at midday.<br /><br />This is classic Agatha Christie at her best. The scene is set, the characters introduced, the clues planted. As always the reader wil be left wondering right up to the end of the book as to who comitted the crime. As with all Agatha Christie novels, there are as many twists and turn in the plot to keep you changing your mind as to the identity of the killer. Agatha Christie is always a joy to read and this is no exception.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang
B0002OERI0|2.0|The only song on this cd that sounds like traditional GOOD Green Day is American Idiot...a good song with awesome lyrics that reflect what anyone could see is going wrong with America through the media....but the rest of the album is ballads!!! Green Day are a punk rock band, descendants of the Ramones...so why do they have to make a concept album? Rock N Roll isnt brain surgery and if they had stuck to their working formula this album would be absolutely kick-ass just like every other album from them. I'm not saying that I want the same album over and over again...Green Day doesnt do that. I mean Warning had slow mellow songs but it worked and it was quirky(like Misery). I love that album. But for the first time since the beginning I am disappointed. Hopefully next time they will make another Punk Rock record minus the piano and ballad sound. Stick to the good stuff, dont buy this one this time around.
B0002OERI0|1.0|More commercial bubble gum stadium rock - er, \\"punk\\" from the \\"Tommy James & the Shondells\\" of Punk Rock, Green Day.  Maybe you don't understand the significance of those references - probably because you were soiling your diaper (or not even born) when REAL punk rock groups like Minor Threat, Black Flag, and the Misfits were playing in hole-in-the-wall joints in front of 30 or 40 people getting expletives and objects thrown at them and their amplifiers un-plugged.    An album of songs decrying America - man, that's some REAL dangerous, uncharted material there.  Real punk.      Don't kid yourself.  There's nothing \\"punk\\" about Green Day or this album.  Hating Bush doesn't make you Punk.  Heck, the Dixie Chicks can do that, and what are they other than a bunch of Redneck-Wannabe Posers churning out bad Pop music disguised as \\"Country?\\"    Making fun of Bush or cutting down America isn't a statement of rebellion or non-conformity.  Its regurgitating a bunch of liberal dogma, spoon-fed to you by Michael Moore, Susan Sarandon, Al Franken, Barbara Streisand, and all the other aging Baby Boomers in positions of power and authority that control the media, college campuses, and other institutions across the country.    \\"Counter-culture\\" is the culture. Even your high school jocks have tatoos and earings.  Green Day sells millions of albums and performs in stadiums, brought to you by Pepsi and American Express.  Yeah.  Real Punk.
B000089RVX|1.0|\\"Experience the moving power of music with...Evanescence!\\". This is a phrase from the radio commercial that got me to listen to this CD. Since I figured it was a waste of money to buy a  CD for 29.98, I waited for 3 months to get it from the local library. After finally listening to this CD, here is what I have to say...IT'S HORRIBLE!!! Almost all of these songs are about empty souls, insanity, and death. Although these songs are free of bad language, they are just as disturbing as songs that contain the \\"F\\" word. There are a few good points about this CD, however. The song \\"My Immortal\\" is good, although on the sad side. Also, the main singer, Amy Lee, has an AMAZING voice; one of the best I've ever heard. If only she had made better use of her talents. These songs will get stuck in your head, and leave no room for anything else. Some of these songs even gave me nightmares! Other than to hear \\"My Immortal\\", I've only listened to this CD twice, and I regret both times. DO NOT buy this CD unless you want to turn your brain to Jell-o, and have never heard of horror movies.
0143034448|2.0|This classic is very difficult to read. Not only is it boring, but the way it's written is weird and jumpy. I did not enjoy the book. I only got through a few chapters before I gave up. It is also very long.
B00005N5S5|4.0|With rumours circulating about a fourth Terminator movie, featuring Arnie in a cameo-only role due to his high priority commitments as California govenor, this will probably ruin the whole trilogy for fans of the films. Arnie is the THE Terminator, if he doesn't come back in a decent role for the fourth, if it goes through (lets all hope it doesn't), I'll be mighty disappointed. Crackers without cheese is what Terminator would be without Arnie (oooh, cheese!)<br /><br />Michael Biehn (yum), and Linda Hamilton also feature alongside Arnie, trying to get rid of him. I actually prefer Linda Hamilton in the second one, the eighties hairstyle she has in this, is very bad. Very, very bad. Although she's a lot more masculine looking in the second, she looks loads better. I also prefer Arnie in the later movies than this one. He's so plastic/fake looking at one point, particularly the scene where he removes his eye, and dons the infamous shades. (One afternoon during a break in filming, Arnold Schwarzenegger went into a restaurant in downtown L.A. to get some lunch and realized all too late that he was still in Terminator makeup - with a missing eye, exposed jawbone and burned flesh.)<br /><br />Michael Biehn's character gets bitten on the hand by another character. This happens to him in every James Cameron movie he's in - see Aliens and The Abyss. The scene where the Terminator punches through a car's windshield was done with a hydraulic piston that was positioned next to Arnold Schwarzenegger, to look like his arm; they even had it pass through the arm on the jacket to give added realism. Auto glass is almost impossible to penetrate, by design, which required them to use hydraulics to get enough force. The idea stayed with Cameron and he used it again during the fight between the T-800 and T-1000 in T2: Terminator 2.<br /><br />To Arnie speaks very little in this movie is an understatement. His voice is used in exactly 16 lines, with 17 sentences spoken. The terminator has two other lines onscreen, one with the voice of a police officer overdubbed, and one with the voice of Sarah's mother overdubbed. There are also many lines with the voice of Sarah's mother, and we learn that the terminator is actually saying them, but we don't see it. Arnie also taught the world is now infamous catchphrase \\"I'll be back\\", which was originally scripted as \\"I'll come back\\". (Just doesn't have the same ring to it, does it?) There is only one time that Michael Biehn and Arnie are in the same frame together. It is when Kyle blasts The Terminator the second time at Tech Noir. When they finally meet in the factory, it is not Arnie, just a metallic puppet.<br /><br />As with all James Cameron DVDs (everything except Titanic - um, HELLO - and Terminator 3, since it wasn't done by him) there are loads of extras on this, most of them pretty tedious if you're not interested in a blow by blow account of every single scene. These include: Terminator A Retrospective; 'Other Voices' documentary; deleted scenes, four trailers (foreign, alternative, teaser, and TV spots); James Cameron's artwork stills; production photos; Stan Winston's photos; visual effects photos; publicity materials; original treatment script stills, and on the DVD-ROM: original treatment script, 1983 fourth draft script and final shooting script.<br /><br />Personally, I'll always prefer the second and third movies to this, but it's still great, as it really introduced the whole story to the viewing audience. The second and third have slightly better effects, plus the third has a female Terminator plus Arnie! Always a must for the guys in the audience.ator has two other lines onscreen, one with the voice of a police officer overdubbed, and one with the voice of Sarah's mother overdubbed.

B00000DCHD|5.0|After the enormous success of \\"The Stranger\\", Joel headed back to the studio. He decided to expand the sounds of \\"The Stranger\\", creating an album with a more sophisticated, jazzy feel to it. Joel moves throughout the album, paying homage to Steely Dan on \\"Zanzibar\\" with a solo from jazz great Freddie Hubbard. The album is glorified with Joel's uncanny sense of showmanship, and never shies away from melody. Although \\"52nd Street\\" isn't completely on par with \\"The Stranger\\", it still holds the best songs Joel's ever recorded.<br /><br />Joel kicks of the album nicely with the rocking \\"Big Shot\\". \\"Stiletto\\" and \\"Honesty\\" emphasize the Broadway overtones of it's predecessor beautifully. \\"My Life\\" and \\"Until the Night\\" rank among Joel's best work as well. Thanks to producer Phil Ramone, the production here is flawless, blending songs together seamlessly, making it a real treat for your ears.<br /><br />Joel really hit his stride in the making of his last 3 albums, creating a workable, marketable formula that holds his place in history as one of the most enjoyable hit-makers of the 70s and 80s.

The kind of laughter that, even if you're at work, or in church or on a plane, will shake your whole body. Sardonic, wild, socially observant and irreverant, this is the first Sedaris I've read and know now what the interest is about. Really goddamn funny.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Thank you Beck for making one of the most underrated realeases ever. Does anyone even know about this classic album. It is sad, it is touching, and it is incredible. What surprised me most about this album was that it was made by beck. I always hoped he's make a ton of albums like that last song on odelay, \\"Ramshackle,\\" and finally he did. It's the perfect album for a road trip in the quiet desert, or for a rainy day. This is the album to own, so please give it a listen
B00004X0Q0|5.0|At a time where not much new was coming out, they conquered everything. Hail to At the Drive-In! Unpredictable, never-seen-before, original, angry, authentic...one of the greatest band of the 90ies that turned out to be (without their consentment I'm sure) pionneers of that Emo wave. But please don't get me wrong. Dashboooooh and company are miles and miles and miles away from what the whole At The Drive-In catalogue has to offer. A disc many have to give it a couple of spins to finally totally get into, a masterpiece on every single note made or sung. The really, truly, totally only shame about this album is that Grand Royal (Beasties Boys's discs label) closed a couple of years ago, and a friend of mine can't even order this cd. He has to find it second-hand!!!! A masterpiece of that class!!!!!!! Please anyone who's reading this and has the power to make a difference...please do so! A grandiose album such as Relationship of command can't end up being a ultra-rare item. It has to be accessible to anyone who's hungry for intelligent music. Thank you.

B00005JNEI|5.0|I'll admit that there are some people who should not see Fahrenheit 9/11 because it will upset them tremendously.  For example, I know a man who spent his life honorably in military service and who would be hurt too much by the images of American soldiers being used and sent to fight by the lies of the Bush administration.  However, no matter the pain that seeing this movie causes, I urge most people to see it because NOT seeing it is just hiding from well-documented evidence regarding the war in Iraq.  We can't fix this problem without seeing that it exists.  Please see the movie and then judge for yourself as to whether or not we are fighting a just war in Iraq.  Share the movie with your friends and neighbors, and talk about it with anyone who will listen.

Toni Iommi is in his prime and his distorted guitar work is more excellent than ever in this album. Bill Wards excellent songwritin is more apparent here. Geezer Butler's bass is more planned out than earlier Sabbath releases adn Ozzy Osbourne's vocals has alot more dimensions and is unequealed in artcraft in Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. This is what real British rock is supposed to sound like. There is no way you could compare Led Zeppelin with this or Deep Purple, there just is no way.
0375507256|5.0|I thought David Mitchell was immensely precocious and talented when I read Ghostwritten, though not many of my friends were as taken with it as I was. Having just finished Cloud Atlas, I am thrilled to report that --in my opinion-- his promise has been realized -- and in such a brief time. The book is more than an endlessly fascinating puzzle. Each of the six characters and stories interwoven here are riveting from literary, aesthetic and philosophical standpoints as well as being great narrative page-turners. You might think that Mitchell was six different writers - all equally brilliant. This is not quite like anything you have ever read before - a new form and vision for a new century.
B000001ESF|5.0|Hey man, usually I would write a review, but this man A Amazon.com Reviewer \\"Stone Cold\\" is laying it down on these teeny-booper poseurs so i'll just sit back and watch them take his wrath. God bless you man!
0441003257|5.0|Terry Pratchett is one of my favourite authors and his collaboration with Neil Gaiman was a stroke of brilliance because they ended up with this wildly funny story of Armageddon.  I howled with laughter, particularly as I read parts of it while on my way along the M25 (designed by Satan himself)-with someone else driving of course...  If you know the book of Revelation, then you will really enjoy this 'take-off.'  If you've never read Revelation, then you might miss a whole lot of the subtleties.  Still, it is a very funny book.  Don't miss it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|The movie is outstanding, and the extras contained in this dvd are superb. Not only is this film significant with one of the most important elections of our time looming over us, it's also entertaining.  It's a very humorous film, mostly because George W. Bush, without meaning to be, is so utterly ridiculous. (It's been said all along that he has the best lines in the whole film!) <br /> <br />I do want to point out, in response to many of the accusations I've been reading in these reviews, that ALL of the facts presented in this film have been proven true.  They are indisputable. Moore's opinions are his own, and he arrives at them by some evidences that Bush supporters probably wish could have stayed buried, but facts are still facts.  Yes, members of the bin Laden family were flown home 2 days after 9/11, with nothing more than a cursory passport check.  Yes, Bush really did waste 7 minutes while the country was under attack, wearing a stupid, deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression, while a grade school class read \\"My Pet Goat\\" and people died horribly in NYC. (He didn't want to frighten the children, he said.  He wanted to project calm.  What do most of you do during a crisis?  Do you deal with it directly, perhaps staving off more harm, or do you sit motionless, befuddled,  wondering what to do, while poor souls jump out windows of 100-story buildings rather than burn alive?) Yes, the Bush family really does have very strong ties and interests in keeping the Saudis happy.  Yes, there's a very strong parallel beetween the grieving Iraqui woman and the grieving American mother of a KIA soldier in Iraq. No, we really had no business invading a country on false pretenses.  Weapons of mass destruction, anyone?  Anyone?  Where?  Oops, made a mistake, and only 1000+ Americans have died so far while the rich (like Bush's \\"base\\") line their pockets further. <br /> <br />If anything the only regret I have about this movie is that it makes me so angry. Our voting systemfailed us when Bush was selected 3 1/2 years ago. Please, please, rent or buy this dvd. You need to know, so the mistake isn't made again.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Get Born comes off as a mix of The White Stripes blues rock, AC/DC's cocky hard rock, and some New York Dolls strut added in, delivering a focused set of punk, garage rock and hard rock tunes from the Australia foursome. Jet play's fast, furious and loud on their hard rockers, while playing soft, melodic and soulful on their ballads. They actually come off as an incredibly tight band, as far as timing, breaks and mixing. Nic Cester (lead guitar) and Cameron Muncey (guitar/vocals) mix up the guitar work very nicely, playing a wide array of notes and tones. Muncey's vocals are very similar, screeching and loud at times, then reminiscent of power ballad vocals at times. Over a quarter of the album consists of ballads. The ballads work very well with the slow dreamy guitar and piano in the background.<br /><br />I feel that the radio has plagued this album from day one, with the single \\"Cold Hard Bi**h\\". That is the only bad track on the album, sounding much like a re-hashed Nazareth song. It's only saving grace is the track that comes right after it, \\"Come Around Again\\", one of the finest ballads on the album. The radio did come back to give Jet more credit with \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\". Looking at those 2 singles, people are left thinking Jet is a an all hard rock band and are commonly grouped in with the \\"The\\" bands. Sweet ballads such as \\"Look What You've Done\\", \\"Radio Song\\" and the early 70s Rolling Stones country ballad inspired \\"Move On\\" prove that they are a multi-faceted rock group. My favorite song here would have to be tight flashy rocker of \\"Rollover D.J.\\", a lyric that will speak to everyone with an opinion on the subject: \\"Hey Rollover DJ - You're spinning away - On my time - Hey, who cares what you play - Say whatever you say, I don't mind - Hey, roll over DJ, if you don't mind\\".<br /><br />\\"Get Born\\" is a promising debut that steals from all the right places. It rocks hard, even epically at times. They're not just another \\"The\\" band, their in your face and here to stay.face and here to stay.
B0002K73EO|4.0|Well, Nick Cave certainly knows how to suck you in. The follow-up to 2003's \\"Nocturama\\" is a solidly moody creation, a two disc set called \\"Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus,\\" courtesy of the ex-Birthday Party vocalist and his new band, the Bad Seeds. One minute mellow, the next bombastic -- and it's pretty good stuff.<br /><br />Certain bands age well, and thankfully Cave hasn't lost his touch. Though only God knows how he manages to churn out an album a year without burning out like a blind moth. Let alone material that is decent in quality -- \\"Abattoir Blues\\" is a warped take on gospel music, complete with a thrilling choir in \\"There She Goes My Beautiful World.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's been a strange, strange day,\\" Cave moans in the first disc. But \\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" takes a slightly different tack -- it's sweeter and more playful. After the heavy rock of songs like \\"Get Ready for Love,\\" the gentle pop of \\"Lyre\\" seems positively idyllic. The sprawling 10-minute finale, \\"O Children,\\" is a spookily beautiful composition that sounds almost prayerlike.<br /><br />\\"Nocturama\\" wasn't the best that Cave and the Bad Seeds could have done. Like a lot of good rock, it was good by objective standards, but not as good as he could've done. \\"Abattoir Blues/The Lyre Of Orpheus\\" fixes that -- it's just a resolutely solid album all around.<br /><br />Whirlwind bass and murky percussion mask the songs of \\"Abattoir Blues,\\" giving a sort of wild stormy sound. Even the lower-key songs like funky \\"Cannibal's Hymn\\" are spooky and weird. Things change quite a bit with \\"Lyre of Orpheus,\\" such as the opener of \\"Breathless\\" -- it's dominated by a gentle acoustic guitar and a flute. In the background of \\"Carry Me,\\" you can hear what sounds like a piano. The music sounds very textured and complete.<br /><br />And despite such brilliant instrumentation, it's hard to tell just how Cave can keep from laughing during some of the songs he sings here. Like \\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" -- he sings about Orpheus crafting a lyre that kills Eurydice, followed by \\"birdies detonated in the sky/bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees.\\" Where do they get these wickedly deranged ideas from? But the lyrics aren't all goofy -- \\"Cannibal's Hymn\\" is morbidly creepy, with its \\"your heart that is bruised but bleating/And bleeding like a lamb.\\"<br /><br />What's best about \\"Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus\\" is that both discs work as individuals albums. But taken together, they feel like a wild night out, and the lazy Sunday morning that comes after.s about Orpheus crafting a lyre that kills Eurydice, followed by \\"birdies detonated in the sky/bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees.\\" Where do they get these wickedly deranged ideas from?

B00005JMXX|1.0|Poorly done film. Bad acting, bad script. But I do not agree that it is \\"liberal bs.\\" I am actually offended that someone would say that. I am a liberal, that doesn't mean that I think we're on the brink of a new ice age. And by the way, you don't have to be liberal to know that the human race has done more harm to this world than good. <br /> <br />This film is awful, regarless. The premise was interesting enough, but the events were poorly researched, the acting was melodramatic and the semi-happy ending was sickening.
B0002234LS|1.0|I wish I could have seen this whole movie but J.Depp combined with a very slow start forced me to turn it off in the first 15 minutes.  The people who liked this movie  must be  very patient types.  I on the other hand was bored to tears. Did I say this movie was a bore? I like Tarantino flicks and movies like \\"Fargo\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\".

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|\\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" based on Stephen King's short novel \\"Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption\\" finally gets the deluxe treatment. This 10th Anniversary edition has a beautiful, rich, vivid and sharp transfer. While there's some minor digital blemishes, it looks remarkably crisp with a faithful reproduction of the original theatrical appearence of the movie. Although some of the darker sequences are a bit murky, the DVD compression doesn't effect the look of the movie substanially.<br /><br />Tim Robbins plays a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover on circumstanial evidence and send to Shawshank prison for two life terms. He befriends Red (Morgan Freeman)while on the inside and begins quietly trying to rebuild as close to a normal life as possible behind bars becoming a good friend to Red's circle of friends as well. Most folks are probably familiar with this well written and directed movie so I'll skip any additional summation of the plot. Besides, to reveal more would spoil the pleasure of viewing this treasure.<br /><br />The first disc consists of the movie with a great commentary track from writer/director Frank Darabont. Darabont discusses the difficulties in adapting King's short novel and the challenges to translating literature to the screen. He also discusses some of the changes he made to King's novel to make it work better as a dramatic presentation and the challenges of casting, performance and location shooting. It's an enlightening commentary track that educates as much as it entertains.<br /><br />The second disc includes \\"The Charlie Rose Show\\" segment devoted to \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and features Darabont, Robbins and Freeman in a great discussion on the making of the film. It's clear that all involved enjoyed working together and that atmosphere carries over to the film that they created together. We also get 2 marvelous documentaries; the first \\"Hope Springs Eternal: A Look Back at The Shawshank Redemption\\"  is a marvelous featurette that covers everything from what inspired Darabont to adapt King's short novel in the first place to the rigors of producing a film at an abandoned closed prison. \\"Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature\\" examines the powerful impact of the movie and features a number of prominent critics and individuals that both discovered this powerful movie when it played in cinemas and on home video. It's not as involving as the first featurette but does give a wealth of detail about the reach and scope of a work of art when it touches an audience in a unique, personal way.<br /><br />We also get the comic spoof of the film \\"The Sharktank Redemption\\" which is actually quite funny. I hadn't seen this before although you'll appreciate it best after having watched the movie. Storyboards, a still gallery and the original theatrical trailer are also included. All are of top quality.<br /><br />The Special Edition Boxed Set includes the BFI book published on the film. It's quite a good book and would be a great reference for film buffs. It's also got a wealth of insight some of which will be worthwhile to film students and hardcore fans of the film. On the other hand, the more casual fan will probably be quite satisfied with the two DVD set. The Special Edition Boxed Set also comes with the film's original soundtrack. The marvelous score by Thomas Newman doesn't have an isolated channel (my one complaint about this DVD)on the DVD so fans of the film who also like the beautifully written but restrained music by Newman will probably want this as well. Other than these two items (and a nice box) there's no difference between the two movies.<br /><br />Is this a great movie? It's a well made epic film that chronicles the redemption of two very different men that end up by circumstance becoming friends. Sure, it deals in some cliches but then so do all movies. It's used as short hand. What matters is that Darabont, like King, turns some of these cliches inside out for many of these characters. This isn't a film for those expecting the latest \\"Jason\\" movie but one that demands patience as it builds the characters over time. In many respects, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" reminds me of Frank Capra's \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"; it's about missed opportunities and a second chance to try and live life to the fullest again.ide out for many of these characters.

B00004X0Q0|5.0|the new music that cedric and omar are generating is creatively pushing \\"rock\\" where it won't be for years to come (mars volta, defacto, et al). however, the roots of this madness lies in ATDI, and this CD is, in my humble opinion, their best. polished, yes. but polished ATDI is raw as (...insert adjective here...) compared with today's overproduced, \\"indy\\" schlock. the guitars are a wall of dischordant sound. the rhythm deafening from the very first drum beat in arcarsenal. the vocals crushing, like cedric is trying to compete with the amplified band and his mic is off. the entire CD from start to end is a cacophony unlike anything you can buy that's been put out in the last year. it is no wonder ATDI played influence to so many other artists....
B00005J6RE|3.0|These are two OK episodes.  To me they are notable for the following: <br /> <br />Ultimate Computer -- Kirk's \\"all I ask is a tall ship\\" speech gives me goosebumps every time. <br /> <br />Omega Glory -- Kirk and Tracey beat the tar out of each other in several fights throughout the course of this episode.  As far as I can tell, William Shatner and Morgan Woodward do all their own stunts, which is pretty impressive as they're throwing each other around A LOT.   <br /> <br />Add to that the fact that Kirk gets roughed up by the Yang leader in that sequence in the prison cell and you have a pretty tough week of work for ol' Mr. Shatner!
B000069AUI|5.0|After I first was dazzled by Parachutes, I was immediately taken into the world of Coldplay, and it was my favorite album, and Coldplay was my favorite band. And then...A Rush of Blood to the Head came out. \\"This is just astounding,\\" I thought. \\"This is what music isn't and what music should be.\\" My favorite song, you ask? I tried to figure that out. I listened to each and every song, balanced them out, and came to a conclusion.    Every song here is worthy of being a favorite.    At first it was The Scientist, but it spread to Clocks, The Scientist and In My Place, but then it hit me.     NO SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS LESS THAN A MASTERPIECE.    If you like Coldplay, you own this. If you hate Coldplay, than too bad, you don't have a taste for good music. Go listen to your mindless rap, because this kind of great music is reserved for us. Smart people with good tastes only.  If you like MUSIC, get this album. If you hate music, get this album. Everybody who's anybody will like this album.    HERE ARE RATINGS FOR THE SONGS ON AROBTTH.    Poltik: 8.5/10    It's a love-it-or-hate-it song. I love it. People hate it because they think it is annoying. Well, true, in a way, but if you listen again and again, it will sound AWESOME with th heartbeat-style headbanging guitar and drums.    In My Place: 9/10    The energetic drums and that one simply AWESOME guitar riff I so sorely want to learn how to play, plus the great lyrics, makes for a worthy single, one of the better songs on this album, and my personal anthem along with The Scientist. My one complaint? It's a little repetitive.      God Put A Smile Upon Your Face: 8.7/10    The guitar is awesome and the slide guitar or whatever it is sounds great. The lyrics are also good. Another great song. \\"Don't ever say you're on your way down...When God gave you style and gave you grace...God put a smile upon your fa-ace\\"   A worthy favorite.    The Scientist: 10/10    Simply...astounding. In every way possible. Really. The lyrics speak of the conflict between knowledge/intellect and raw emotion. This is my favorite song EVER; and if you hate this, then I hate you.    Clocks: 8.7/10    Wow. This song is so unique. Some say these sound like U2 lyrics, (Lyrics.com) but...no. It pulls you into a parallel world. The piano at the beginning pulls you in. This song is JUST TOO OVERPLAYED on the radio. It was even on the Peter Pan (the new version) soundtrack. Now everyone's heard it, and it adds to the reason everyone says Coldplay is supposedly \\"sappy radio-friendly material\\". I DON'T LIKE YOU GUYS!    Daylight: 8.5/10     Great use of orchestra. It leans a little too much toward being filler, but it wins out with its piano and orchestra that draws you in even more than Clocks, even though Clocks is better.    Green Eyes: 9/10    Very sweet and emotional. It tells a simple love story and talks about the straightforwardness of love. These are the most direct  lyrics; in second place, Shiver, from Parachutes. THese lyrics aren't ones you really have to think about like Scientist or CLocks.    Warning Sign: 9/10    The song in its entirety is great, but it has a very sweet and simple chorus that I personally like. \\"Well the truth is...I miss you\\" The entire song aches with beauty, as with the rest of the album.    A Whisper: 7.0/10    It is weaker than the other songs, it is more repetitive, but it is nonetheless good. My complaint is that the music is annoying, drags on, and that the lyrics are SO QUIET compared to the annoyingly loud music. The closest to filler on this album.  I CAN'T HEAR THE D*** LYRICS!!!    A Rush of Blood to the Head: 10/10    It tells a story that will make you contemplate everything you feel emotionally and everything you do physically. Any mistake you make, just blame it upon a rush of blood to the head.    Amsterdam: 10/10    Simply awesome. A great finale. I can't say how much I love this song. It is slow and long, but certainly not boring. This is one of the the best songsColdplay has ever done. \\"But time...is on your side...it's on your si-i-ide now\\" Simply beautiful and is a PERFECT ending.    Coldplay was my favorite band once I heard Parachutes, and this just betters my reason for this being my favorite. There is something especially cool about this group. What is the genre? Is it slow rock? Is it pop? It's neither. They have created their own genre. (AND NO, THEY HAVE NOT COPIED RADIOHEAD, U2, PINK FLOYD, OR TRAVIS!!!! ESPECIALLY THE THING WITH U2-GOD, WHAT IS WITH YOU GUYS WHO SAY THIS COPIES U2??!!?)     TRACKS: 11  BEST SONGS: The Scientist, Clocks, GPASUYF, In My Place, Politik, Warning Sign, Amsterdam, Title Track  AVERAGE SONGS: Daylight, Green Eyes    WORST SONG: A WHISPER  LISTENABILITY: 9/10  RECOMMENDED? Of course!      PS. What is Coldplay's next album gonna be called? Any rumors or anything, I just wanna get some part of an idea! And yes, they are making a new album. Go on coldplay.com.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Growing up in the 90's led my musical tastes to be affected by what was popular. At the age of eight in 1995 I bought my first cassette (yes Cassette). This was Green Day's Dookie. Ok, so that was my point about the whole growing up bit. From the beginning basically i was a green day fan. Through the years i gradually bought all of their albums up until about 2 years ago when i figured out green day really wasn't that special. Three-chord progression pop-punk. When i looked at it technically i felt embarrassed about listening to them. But they still held a big spot in my heart (their poster still up in my room). Enough background. On to American Idiot.  First things first. Awesome album. I am relieved to know that Green Day had this in them. Their most experimental album sonically, they stray from their original format while still sounding like themselves. Kinda hard to explain, but here, to contrast the differences in styles. Take the simple blues rock of zeppelin I and then look at Houses of the Holy. Very different styles, but still very led zeppelin. Not saying this sounds like any of those, but the difference is great when comparing American Idiot to albums like dookie and nimrod. Buy this, pop it in, and listen to the whole thing at one time.  Rock rock on.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Before voting on November 2nd, be sure to see \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\".  Maybe it won't change your mind, maybe it will.  At the worst, you might come away with a better idea about why at least half the population of this country and most of the rest of the world are praying to see the end of the most appalling presidency since Warren G. Harding, and possibly since the formation of the United States of America.    The four years since the Bush administration took over in 2000 have truly put the previous eight years of the Clinton administration in perspective.  Back in the 90s I actually believed for a time that Clinton should be impeached for daring to question the definition of \\"is\\" before the House/Senate investigative committee.  Now it's time to admit that that was a mistake.  The Clinton administration gave us 8 years of never-before and never-again prosperity, and 8 years of relative peace. Clinton's misbehavior was child's play compared with Bush's Orwellian world of manipulation, spin, and double-speak that we live in now.  \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" documents this transition from the Clinton era to the Bush era, starting with the stolen election of 2000 and the complicit undermining of free speech by the U.S. media, and moving to the questionable relationship of the Bush family to the Saudi royals.  Of course, most heartbreaking are the stories of soldiers and their families who are most devastated by the decisions of the neocons.         In just 4 years the U.S. economy has gone from a record surplus to record debt -- the highest in U.S. history.  And how many wars have we been in since 2000 -- I've lost count.  But based on the nightly news and the Republican spin machine, you'd never guess that anything was at all amiss.  \\"Keep on shopping\\", they say, and everything will turn out fine.    Even though at one time I thought Clinton should be impeached, I'm now firmly convinced that Bush, Cheney, Rove, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Ashcroft, Condi Rice, and maybe Colin Powell should all go to jail.  Sure, other administrations have ruined the economy and driven us into war, but this one stole an entire election, exposed a CIA operative, and fabricated and lied about the reasons for going to war -- all treasonable offenses.  You can bet that if any Democrat had committed these crimes we'd be hearing about it 24/7 on Fox News.    And if anyone thinks that things can't get any worse, just wait.  The only thing keeping this administration under any kind of restraint at all is the fear of not getting re-elected.  A second term will make the first look like a day at Disneyland...      And speaking of Disney, don't forget to see \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\"!  You may not agree with everything that Michael Moore says, but the images are unforgettable. If you don't like listening to Mr. Moore, try watching with the sound turned off, the footage speaks for itself.  In those images you'll witness the catastrophic consequences of unchecked and misguided power wielded by a government that has only a very tenuous claim to legitimacy, in the first place.  Truly, these are themes that echo through the ages...
B0002WYS6S|5.0|<br />If you give this DVD less than 5 stars, I'll dropkick you. <br />   <br />Excellent video quality.  Excellent video production. Excellent light show. Excellent stage set-up. Excellent stage show.  Excellent sound quality.  Excellent(period).   <br /> <br />I have one minor complaint though... the guitar solos seem quiet... i'm not sure if it's just my stereo, but it's a little too much in the background for my liking. <br /> <br />Other than that, this DVD is prime and if your a real Dream Theater fan, you already have it and have watched it a couple times.  Also check out the live CD which is also really good (and u need it in order to complete your DT CD collection). <br /> <br />*****  \\"BUY IT NOW\\" <br />
B000001FVL|4.0|\\"The Age of Plastic\\" contains some great pop songs although the production is now starting to show its age a little.  The members of The Buggles, unlike many of today's so called pop stars, were all seasoned musicians.  This is reflected in the quality of both the playing and material throughout the album.  The arrangements are inventive and interesting and it is clear that this record was an inspiration and influence on many of the 80's and 90's pop acts.  The album is an introduction to the production style that would become Lead Singer Trevor Horn's trademark.  Fans of the 80's Yes albums \\"90125\\" and \\"Big Generator\\" will undoubtedly recognise some stylistic similarities in places.  Highlights include the worldwide mega hit \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\", \\"Clean Clean\\", \\"Elstree\\" and \\"Johnny on The Monorail\\".  Overall a fine melodic pop record.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Yes!! They Finally did it rite this time; 5.1 surround sound! I am a huge DT fan, I have met some of the members at autograph signing's and have been to five concerts. They have always been one of my favorite bands but now after watching this DVD I am really impressed. The sound is top notch and the video is very clear. This is the live DVD the band was missing. Jordan Rudess is the man. There is a special multi-angle feature so you can watch what each member is doing pretty close up. I watched Jordan and I was really inspired by his playing and he seems like a really cool guy too, Im glad he joined DT full time, it was a smart decision from DT to say the least. The angle of John Myung is cool too, the guy has some insane chops! up there with Getty Lee and Steve Harris. Maybe even better? All the members bring something to the table, truly a Dream Theater...PS I really thought the computer screen Jordan uses on his keyboard was innovative. The music score is displayed on a monitor so he just has to touch the screen to turn the page of manuscript, Great Idea..
B0002WYS6S|5.0|I bought this dvd expecting just to add to my dt collection. I saw them about a month before they filmed this concert, and i was excited to add the Train of Thought songs on video to my collection. THIS EXCEDED every expectation I had. The cinamatorgraphy and editing are absolutely beautiful. The music is recorded perfectly. <br /> <br />Not only do you see these guys playing songs from their new album, but you get to see them play songs from all their albums. The \\"instramedly\\" is BEYOND WORDS, and the extended solo section in \\"Beyond This Life\\" is stunning. <br /> <br />The bonus footage is fantastic. It takes you behind the scenes of DT's Japan tour and gives you an inside look at the technical aspects of putting their music together.   The documentary has some insanely funny parts too. <br /> <br />If you're a music fan of any genera, BUY THIS. It is worth well beyond the 20-something bucks you end up paying for it.
B00005JNEI|4.0|By way of introduction, I consider myself a true moderate.  That means that I watch BOTH CNN and Fox News, and I listen to BOTH local AM radio and NPR.  Apparently, I am in the minority, as most Americans seem to want to listen to only the people who support their existing viewpoint. <br /> <br />At the time this film came out, I looked desparately for a detractor who had ACTUALLY seen it.  Much to my chagrin, even John McCain, my favorite national politician (at least until he started serving as water-boy for the Bush re-election campaign), dissed the film without having even seen it. <br /> <br />As a piece of film (for which it is rarely judged), this is a very well put together - with a nice contrast between the comic and the tragic. <br /> <br />As a political commentary and indictment of the Bush administration, there is a whole lot of stuff that I took with the requisite grain of salt.  First of all, the fact that only one officer patrols the entire coast of Oregon is not only not within the jurisdiction of the federal government, but is not really that significant.  Secondly, I do not really think that the Bush-Bin Laden family connection, and financial gain to be had from a war on terrorism, inhibited the administration from stopping 9/11, as is implied by parts of the film.  The problem I have with conspiracy theories is that they assume a level of competency that is probably not there. <br /> <br />Ultimately, however, I believe that there are parts of this film that are effectively indisputable and ultimately cemented my opposition to the Bush administration.  The most telling part of the film is the footage of Bush, continuing in his photo op with grade school children, for several minutes after being told the U.S. was under attach.  Just watch the blank stare of a deer in the headlights, without Moore's commentary, and tell me that this is the guy you want to be the next president.  It says alot about the true nature of his character and the tremendousinfluence of his handlers that he did not get up, right then and there, and do SOMETHING.  We already knew from the 2000 election that this guy was no Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, FDR, or Reagan, but that footage (conspicuously absent at the time 9/11 occured) has convinced me that this has got to stop.  And I still haven't heard a rebuttal from the Republicans on THIS part of the film. <br />
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I bought this album the day after Christmas of 2003 along with \\"Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols\\" and \\"The Ramones\\". I loved The Ramones and The Sex Pistols, but for some reason I didn't like it when I first got it. I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it. <br /> Two months later, I brought it back out, and I'm glad I did. I was blown away from it. It was like I was listening to it for the first time. It was like Punk Rock, 60s pop, and everything else thrown together to create a great record. Most albums that have different kinds of music thrown together in the album, and that's it. But in here every single song has been weaved to fit the sound of everything that everyone loves. <br /> Every song on here is a classic. Whether a hit song or a song that did not become a hit, they are all classics. Now, don't listen to Henry McPruter. He calls bands like New Kids on the Block and Hanson Black Metal, says Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, and countless others are terrible, calls Fred Durst a \\"genius\\", says the only reason we consider Jimi Hendrix great is because he is dead, he was even dumb enough to say that Ramones are Green Day wannabes when The Ramones were around for 14 years before Green Day came around(I peronally love them both by the way). <br /> This is a great album and don't let someone who doesn't even know rock in the first place, tell you it sucks. <br />  <br />Love, <br />The Jones
B00005JNEI|5.0|Some of the previous reviewers criticized this movie because of what they say are factual errors, but if you look  carefully, outside of the movie, there is no data to support the critics. Most of what Michael Moore documents in this movie is true. Sad though it is. I think we need to be very careful of the lies in this campaign,  because I think we are being told the same things over and over again in the hopes that we will eventually think that the message is true even if our own instincts and common sense say that they are not. <br />Over all I give the movie a 5. Thank you, Michael Moore, for making us think.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I don't normally write reviews, but after reading a couple reviews here, I feel that it is necessary. 1: Wow, Green Day isn't punk? No Sh*t. They are as close to punk as NIN is to industrial. They are still good bands. 2: THIS ALBUM IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT!!! This goes to anti-bush fanatics as well as hard-headed cowboys. This is merely a concept album in the same light as \\"Tommy\\" by The Who. THIS IS NOT A PUNK CD NOR A POLITICAL STATEMENT.  <br /> <br />Now that that's over with.. <br /> <br />This album is a very good cd. You can't say that about too much music today. It is an album about coming of age, about rebelling against society, and finally coming back down to earth. It is nothing necessarilly new, but it is awesome. If you like good alternative/pop music, this is a goddamn good album. In fact, the single is definitely the worst song on here, it sounds like rehashed Green Day from Dookie days. The rest of the album has a great epic sound tying it together. There are a couple power ballads, a couple fast punk-ish songs, a couple songs closely resembling emo, and yes, some rock opera. This is just a good album.  <br /> <br />If you like good music, this album is for you. It surprised me as much as Sea Change by Beck surprised me. It is deep, developed, and is greatly structured. Green Day has the potential to be one of the best bands EVER. If they keep evolving.  <br /> <br />Buy it.
B00005JMH2|4.0|No celebrity this year has been more adversely affected by media overexposure than Jennifer Lopez. Her tempestuous breakup with Ben Affleck followed by her whirlwind marriage to Marc Anthony made her a permanent fixture on magazine covers and entertainment programs for months, and the public has grown tired of her unending series of hang-ups and heartbreaks. To win back her fans, Lopez has chosen to star in an adaptation of the 1996 Japanese romantic comedy classic Shall We Dance?, giving the actress ample opportunities to showcase her vulnerability and shake her internationally acclaimed groove-thing. Although her efforts to return to the A-list may be hopeless, it should be noted that her latest movie, while far from perfect, is a reasonably charming, consistently enjoyable little chick flick that will do her image no further injury.      Lopez plays the role of Paulina, a frustrated dancer who takes a job teaching at a Chicago dance school after a humiliating failure in a dance competition and a subsequent breakup with her partner/boyfriend. Her plaintive yet beautiful appearance catches the attention of harried lawyer John Clark (Richard Gere), who sees her in the window of the school every night on his way home from work. Clark is slowly being stifled by his dull job and predictable marriage to cosmetics hotshot Beverly (Susan Sarandon), and impulsively decides to join the dance school to learn more about the mysterious woman. In typical Hollywood fashion, he meets a lot of wacky classmates and daffy instructors, reignites the passion in his life through ballroom dancing, and ultimately helps Paulina reconnect to her art.    If this sounds like a rather scant plot for a movie that is almost two hours long, it is. Director Peter Chelsom and screenwriter Audrey Wells try to fill the time by crafting many redundant scenes where Gere performs awkwardly on the dance floor or Lopez stares resentfully at someone, and the results are sometimes sleep-inducing. They alsointroduce several subplots to keep the narrative flowing, with varying degrees of success. I greatly enjoyed the exploits of Link Peterson (Stanley Tucci), a colleague of Clark's who displays a macho faade at the office while secretly pursuing a sizzling dance career through the school. Link's efforts to conceal his identity on the dance floor through the use of a frightful wig are consistently hilarious, and his fear of being branded a (...)because of his love of dancing offers poignant commentary on the confining nature of gender stereotypes.    Another storyline involving an abrasive dancer (Lisa Ann Walter) who must collaborate with Peterson and Clark to triumph in a local dance contest is also interesting and well-paced, while the dance-off itself is one of the best filmed and best choreographed sequences in the movie. Conversely, the sections of the film where Beverly (unaware that her husband is taking dance lessons) hires a detective to investigate John's frequent disappearances are ridiculous and frustrating because there is no logical reason for John to conceal such prosaic information from his wife and no cause to believe that an assertive businesswoman like Beverly would be too mousy to simply ask her husband about his whereabouts.     For all its flaws, Shall We Dance? usually manages to get by on the enormous charisma of its cast. Gere manages to overcome his good looks to create an endearing and sympathetic portrait of a loser, and his game attempts at dancing are every bit as infectious as they were in Chicago. Omar Benson Miller and Bobby Cannavale win laugh after laugh as two inept dance pupils seeking to impress the women in their lives, but usually fail to steal scenes that have already been conquered by the delightfully over-the-top antics of Tucci and Walter. And although she is criminally underused, Sarandon is heartbreakingly realistic as the distraught wife (her deeply moving monologue on the reasons why people get married is worth the price of admission alone). The weakest link in this almost-perfect chain is J-Lo, who simply lacks the dramatic depth to make her character's frustration and sorrow seem like more than a protracted hissy-fit. However, since her only plot function is to lure Gere into the dance school and help him train for the dance-off (leaving her absent from more than half of the movie), she can win over the audience on the strength of her sexy costumes and fine dancing skills.               I consider myself a firm opponent of predictable, clichd romantic comedies, but Shall We Dance is graceful, enthusiastic and well-acted enough to transcend this genre for significant portions of its running time. It will absolutely enthrall romantic damsels who can weep for Gere and Sarandon and cheer J-Lo's ultimate redemption. Everyone else will enjoy a pleasant evening at the movie's that will neither rival memories of the classic source material nor induce nausea. When the box-office competition includes movies about talking sea creatures and horny firefighters, one could probably do worse.
B0002858YS|5.0|I heard \\"Somebody Told Me\\" on the radio one night, quite by accident, as I normally avoid listening to the radio. I knew by the song's conclusion that I would have to find and buy the entire CD (risky though that practice often is). Fortunately, every song on this album is likeable.   <br />The first song is entitled \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\", and it recalls the music of the 1980's with its synthesizers and its heavy beat. It's a delightful introduction to the album, and perhaps as lovable of a song as \\"Somebody Told Me\\" (which, obviously, is completely enchanting.) \\"Andy, You're a Star\\" is another of my favorites with its somewhat contemplative tempo and sharp guitar. The last song on the album, \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" is a pleasant, heavy yet delicate conclusion to one of the most excellent albums in my collection. I believe The Killers can be interpreted as a combination of The Cure, The White Stripes, and of course, their own admirable uniqueness. Their strong presentation, their memorable music and their willingness to use synthesizers (I've missed them so) create a CD worth owning and listening to with regularity. I proudly recommend Hot Fuss.
B000003CUJ|4.0|I know that many Wagner purists will dismiss this album with a wave of the hand since there are no vocals in it whatsoever.  Being a Wagner enthusiast myself (a Ring addict in particular), I respect what Maazel is trying to do here and I think that he pulled it off very well.  The way I see it, this album is useful for two main purposes: <br /> <br />1. To introduce new listeners and opera skeptics to the Ring cycle (a daunting task). <br />2. Face it, not everyone has 16 hours to devote to music.  This is a diverse sampling of Ring excerpts - most of the motives show up somewhere or another and most of the &#34;flashy&#34; orchestral passages are included.  Many of the transitions either _are_ smooth or _seem_ smooth to someone not familiar with the Ring (although some of them are outright annoying once you get familiar with the complete work - e.g., Rheingold prelude-&#62;Valhalla, Nibelheim-&#62;Donner, Rhine Journey-&#62;Horn call). <br /> <br />The real reason I love this CD so much is that it was my own bridge to Wagner many years ago.  If you are only familiar with the usual overtures and preludes, this gives you something more to listen to without the &#34;screeching sopranos,&#34; if you're against that sort of thing (although you will soon get over this feeling once you watch and/or listen to a full-length recording!)  I will admit that Maazel can be bland at times, and some of his tempi rather fast, hence the 4 star rating.  But a few of the passages on this cd are simply amazing, including for instance Dawn in the Gotterdammerung Prologue, Wotan's farewell in Die Walkure, and even the prelude to Rheingold. <br /> <br />So definitely go for this CD if you are relatively new to Wagner and want to hear more of his music.  I recommend it with reservations to listeners already familiar with the Ring, but unless you are completely anti-Maazel I think you will probably enjoy it as a complement to a full recording.
B0001Z36PK|5.0|This is one of the most cohesive and beautifully crafted records I have ever heard, and is very much a return to the old-style Divine Comedy with it's lush orchestrations and rich, opulent atmosphere.  I personally love the way Neil Hannon has chosen each instrument for it's particular sound, instead of just using what was available (ie. drums, guitar, bass...) on every track.  Although it does include a couple of 'dirges' and an instrumental track that goes nowhere, this is a great album overall with some really beautiful and uplifting songs, with all the lyrical humour, 1960s feel and Scott Walker vocals of old. <br />
B000002NIW|5.0|this cd is in my opinion by far their best work. alot of the songs are upbeat and full of energy and are very catchy. this cd isnt at all repetitive in anyway at all. its a short cd so you cant get bored at all through this cd. all the tracks are mostly straight-forward.

B0002WYS6S|5.0|This DVD tops them all for a live concert release. I am a huge DT fan and this DVD truly blew me away. It is light years ahead of their previous DVD releases. The technical ability of the band just never stops getting more and more ridiculous. All five of the band members display on this concert that they are at the top of their respective musical classes. The song selection is excellent. The video quality is superb along with the sound quality. I have noticed that in the last year or two, James Labrie's voice has gotten much better. He seemed to get tired on the last few concert dvds and started missing a lot of high notes about half-way through the concert. At Budokan, his voice is actually better live than on some of the studio recordings! Very passionate singing, great range, and knows when not to overdo it. If you are even a quasi Dream Theater fan, you MUST get this DVD. I promise, it will blow you away. DT is at its zenith.
B000001U3K|4.0|A wonderfully bizarre and entertaining album, TRANSFORMER features many of the qualities that make Lou Reed such a unique figure in rock.  Like his work with the underrated Velvet Underground, this album is quirky, unpredictable, and awfully clever.  \\"Vicious\\" offers a perfect intro to a fun and wacky endeavor.  Regardless of how one feels about Reed's music (or his notorious extracurricular activities), he is never dull or derivative.  Of course, the fifth track, \\"Walk on the Wild Side,\\" became the biggest song of his career, including his work with the VU.  Though \\"Wild Side\\" is a classic about the seamier side of New York City, it is probably not even the best song on the album.  That honor may likely go to the third track, \\"Perfect Day,\\" a haunting, dream-like tune that foreshadows the sorrow that would characterize Reed's subsequent BERLIN, one of the most thoroughly miserable albums of all time (though not bad, actually).  Though the music is pretty strong throughout, the second half of TRANSFORMER pales in comparison to the first.  \\"Satellite of Love,\\" perhaps the second most famous song from this record, is a little overrated, but memorable nonetheless.  \\"Goodnight Ladies\\" provides a nearly flawless ending to an extremely impressive effort.  The key ingredient in the mix may be Reed's tremendous sense of humor which shows up in various ways in most of the numbers.  Unfortunately, it is this essential Reed characteristic that is sadly missing on BERLIN, which pales in comparison to this triumphant accomplishment.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Remember high school bullies? The rich ones. There was <br />nothing you could do about them. They delighted in <br />dispensing fear. They never seemed to back up their <br />threats themselves, but almost always had others do it for <br />them. And maybe you got tired of it, and decided,  since <br />this is my high school too, though I don't have wealthy <br />parents, and am not the captain of the football team, I'll <br />tell someone. I will rat them out. But, no. Too scared. <br /> <br />You think maybe being a non entity is a good deal. I after <br />all am not bullying anyone, or  lying about people. I'm not <br />cheating on my exams. It will come back to haunt the <br />bullies. Because you believe in justice You hear about <br />things being for a reason. You hear that if you are good <br />and don't curse or drink or smoke, or hurt other people, <br />you're OK. <br /> <br />But the bullies drink and smoke. And think nothing about <br />hurting other people. They kind of enjoy it.  Some of them <br />drink and smoke a lot. You think it's so transparent. I see <br />the results of their bullying and getting away with it. <br />Where is the justice?  <br /> <br />And you think: If I  was mean enough, or if only I had a <br />rich daddy. If only I didn't have to study hard or at all, <br />and teachers still passed me to the next grade? So you go <br />home at night and you study three or four hours, then you <br />continue reading a book before school interrupted you <br />from real books and learning real stuff. Books like <br />\\"1984,\\" \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" \\"Johnny Got His Gun,\\" \\"Brave <br />New World,\\" or \\"All Quiet on the Western Front.\\" And <br />you maybe want to talk about them in English lit. class <br />because you've grown tired of the sanitized stuff in the <br />text book. But you know your thoughts are suspect.  <br />When did this happen? As you discover there are an awful <br />lot of bullies around. And they aren't all in school. And <br />they are not terribly bright. You just know they will make <br />it in the world. You just know they will get away with <br />anything. <br /> <br />You read later Bertrand Russell's definition of how <br />schools make \\"manly men\\" and how those \\"manly men\\" <br />die on battlefields, not knowing why, and it all has to do <br />with school, and learning to play the game and not earn <br />the enmity of \\"fools.\\" And maybe some of these \\"manly <br />men\\" who were bullies (the ones without money, who did <br />not get daddy to buy them out of the draft) got killed in <br />battle. War turned out not like another high school <br />football game after all. And yet, isn't this what Michael <br />Moore is saying? That it all starts then? That if everyone <br />will be a patriot to their school, things will be okay?  <br /> <br />Newsies don't ask hard ball questions of certain bullies <br />anymore. They just have their hair blow dried properly, <br />their make up done well, and they sit in front of a camera <br />and they read what someone wrote for them. And it's all a <br />high school setting. And that's where we are. Only it's a <br />billion times worse. A thousand American soldiers are <br />dead. Ten or more thousand innocent Iraqis. And few <br />been saying anything for such a long time. Just hot air. <br />Just noise. Katie Couric thinks \\"Navy SEALS rock\\" <br />however. <br /> <br /> If Michael Moore has to have courage to make this film, <br />if people have to have courage to go see it, or to tell <br />others about it, and not to have \\"propaganda\\" tossed in <br />their faces by  people who are so well, informed, they've <br />not seen it, or any of his other movies, or have not read <br />any of his books, then it seems the big quiet is on. Or was. <br />I happened to like my high school. And it made me mad <br />beyond words when one of the bullies was graduated like <br />all the rest of us even though his term paper for English <br />was copied word for wordfrom his sister's term paper a <br />few years before when she was in the same class with the <br />same teacher. The teacher nailed him right there before us.  <br />Threw the paper right at him. Furious. Said he would not <br />graduate. She lied. Or was told to graduate him. Which <br />she did. <br /> <br />It always takes courage to tell the truth. To have the facts. <br />To do the job the news has abdicated itself from in such <br />cowardice. That is what is called freedom. It takes no <br />courage to do nothing and pretend you do not see what <br />you see, or do not hear what you hear. <br /> <br />Death is not \\"Hoppy Rides the Range:\\" circa 1943.  I <br />didn't have to go fight a war though. I did not have to <br />lose a son in a war. I did not have to receive that horrible <br />phone call announcing with regrets....I didn't have to have <br />children die in my arms. I didn't have to have my friend <br />blown to bits beside me. I didn't have to have an arm or <br />leg amputated. I didn't have to have my guts blown out <br />and me with a bag on my side the rest of my life. I didn't <br />have to die for something that was not so. <br /> <br />Moore reminds us that right now, right this second, <br />someone is being cut apart by bullets, someone is being <br />blown to bits by a bomb, someone, a child, for instance, is <br />crying in her sleep because there is nothing but a scream <br />left in her, in a tent hospital somewhere in the Mid East, <br />and that scream is one heck of a lot more important, than <br />going along, than just hoping it doesn't touch you, <br />because it will, eventually.  <br /> <br />Michael Moore says so. Well, passionately, with the facts <br />to back him up. And for anyone not obsessed with doing <br />the second grade versions of the dozens on him because <br />of his physical characteristics, that should be the thing that <br />counts. Please see this movie. Facts are facts. And he has <br />the talent, the tenacity, the compassion, the humanity to <br />tell us so. And make me, for one, a little ashamed at how <br />quiet I've been. It's time we graduate. <br />
B00005NB8K|5.0|Alot of people have said that this movie isn't completely accurate...and even though that is true...the movie was amazing! The acting was great. They could not have found anyone else to play the part of someone as amazing as Jim Morrison...Val Kilmer was fantastic! You really felt like you were seeing Jim all over again. And while it is true that this movie only shows the wild and drug-addicated side of Jim, the movie...the acting...and the direction is great! Oliver Stone did a great job of showing Jim the way that Oliver saw him...and Oliver even said that was how it was supposed to be...an opinion and a vision that he had. So with that in mind...and the fact that Val Kilmer, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon, and Meg Ryan did an amazing job, this movie is one of those...turn out the lights and let your mind go...kind of movies!

B00005JNEI|5.0|IF.. <br />      You walk into this movie with an open mind, you'll be floored. This is war. You have a few deeply rooted mentalities doing battle in this country. It has never been this polarized. Those that manage the information flow are working overtime to silence or discredit the other side. Despite any negative things that can be said about this movie, here are the things that are true: <br /> <br />* A lot of the information in the movie is very valuable because the press wouldn't touch it out of fear of reprisal. <br /> <br />* NONE of the information in the movie HAS BEEN DEBUNKED. Period. There are plenty of radical attack sites with a bunch of strawman arguments, but NONE of them have actually disproven a single fact in the movie. <br /> <br />* Even a staunch Conservative (such as myself) will be very moved by this movie unless they are so blinded by rhetoric that they don't want to challenge their worldview. <br /> <br />* You can't argue with the footage. It's there. You see it. <br /> <br />* The movie is a rollercoaster of sometimes funny, sometimes very sad, and sometimes over the top scenes. At times it will make you angry if you have a heart beating in your chest. <br /> <br />* Much like the recent Presidential debate, there are scenes that simply make you shake your head, close your eyes, and just feel really sorry for our President. It got so bad at one point I almost had to stop watching. It's the kind of eye-opener that is necessary, but it doesn't make it any easier. <br /> <br />* The soldiers are the real stars of the movie. They steal it. As much as I dislike Moore, I have to thank him for showing our soldiers the way they really are. It made me proud. <br /> <br />* It's doubtful the movie is going to change your mind on much. If anything, it's an entertaining look behind the curtain covering the corridors of power. We ALL know that the Gov't does things they can't tell us about, and can't always be straight with us on the reasons behindreasons. You don't have to fear that you'll turn into a bleeding heart tree kisser with berkenstocks or whatever just by seeing this movie, unless you are truly worried you are that easily manipulated.  <br /> <br />However...... <br /> <br />There is definitely Mr. Moore's spin on things. I almost wish at points you could turn off his commontary and just watch the raw footage to draw your own conclusions. It's very easy to decide which parts of his dialog to pay less attention to. And to be fair, at certain parts there is only ONE conclusion to make, and he nails perfectly. This movie should be seen by anyone planning to vote this year. Oh, and it has a very impressive soundtrack as well. Although he doesn't give equal time to bashing the Democrats, he does do it often in the film and doesn't hold back. If anything, this movie made me respect Mr. Moore enough that I'm starting to add his work to my library so I can gain the benefit of an alternate perspective. I'm STILL voting the way I had planned, but I'm paying much closer attention now. This movie accomplished what it set out to do, and more. That's why I give it a perfect score. At one point in the movie, our President tells Mr. Moore to his face \\"Hey Mike, GET A REAL JOB!\\". It made me see a different side of our President that I hadn't seen before, and made me laught out loud. You see a human side of our President. Definitely a good show.
B00001U0GQ|4.0|I love movies with beautiful scenery and this is one of my favourite.  Add a great story, great soundtrack and good actors and you have my kind of movie.  As with all good movies I loose myself for that moment and escape to another world that is different from what I'm used to.  That is all I ask from a movie and this one does just that.  I wanted to give this movie a four and a half star rating but didn't know how on the review page.

This book assumes that you already know about refactoring and even states clearly that this book is best read with Martin Fowler's \\"Refactorings\\" as a reference. With that prerequisite in mind, this text does an excellent job of introducing the process of using refactorings to fix code problems by introducing patterns into your design. <br /> <br />Some of the strongest points include: editing, organization, and clarity. My hat goes off to the editor(s) of this book as I found very few errors even though this book contains a lot of \\"real world\\" code. Organizationally, this book does an excellent job of making itself useful as a \\"read-through\\" book for those that want to immerse themselves in the topic and as a reference book that can sit on your shelf until you need it. <br /> <br />One word of caution about this book is that it originally started as a paper and grew from there. Especially throughout the first few chapters of the book, this is very evident. Constant references to works done by other authors and numerous footnotes can, at times, become a bit distracting from the overall message. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an excellent book and, if you're into extreme programming and refactoring, it's one that you're going to want to have on your shelf.
