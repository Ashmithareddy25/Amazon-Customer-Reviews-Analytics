B009NQKPUW|3.0|I was expecting more from this one.  The story moved along pretty slowly and the drama and action seemed to be lacking.  It fulfilled it's prequel requirement and explained a few things in Alien.  Overall - so-so, nothing special

B007QUUJMG|5.0|Perks of being a wallflower was a raw, honest and exact depiction on how coming of age is. while i was reading the book i wondered why charley was at times odd, why people thinks he's weird, why his sister treats him that way and why does he kept crying. then as i continued reading further i understood why, i felt sad for charlie. I wish i had read this book when i was in high school. now i am keen to see the movie, i hope it's as good as the book.

B000IYV1ME|4.0|Syriana is a political drama/thriller that revolves the oil industry, along with the people involved and affected by it. Albeit much deeper and complicated, I'll leave the story at that to avoid a lengthy review. Syriana is a demanding and complicated yet entertaining and captivating film.<br /><br />The story follows four characters that are affected by oil industry politics. They are not directly connected and they never interact with each other, but they do relate. The story can be a bit overwhelming and confusing, which is why the film is demanding and complicated. You have to give this film your full attention to completely understand it, you should even go in with some background information. In fact, a second viewing may be necessary. However, the film still manages to be entertaining and captivating. Knowing the film had a complicated storyline, I actually didn't want to take my eyes of the screen and wanted to memorize the names, the locations, the actions, and the motives. The performances from the cast were also great; George Clooney being as charismatic as usual. The dialogue and conversations were immersive and authentic. The final 15 minutes or so were also deeply compelling. The music was great, as well.<br /><br />Overall, Syriana has an overwhelming story- a complicated yet compelling story; a story worth watching more than once, and one that can spark interest in the complicated subject. The film is technically great, from the superb performances to the great music. It's not a film for everyone, so I recommend a rental before purchasing.<br /><br />Syriana has strong violence and blood.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not really my style of writing. Story line very predictable.<br />I wanted to have more story line, with some surprises
8866130931|5.0|it was really hard to find this specific moleskine, I received what I expected. this is my second one. ..
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book has numerous jerky turns that make me put down the kindle and process what just happened. An amazingly well written series. Praise for the Mortal Instruments series.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I had little hope for any story, but I was pleasantly surprised. Very good blending of characters. I am a comic book collector from way back in the 1970 and I am getting used to movies wrecking the characters and story lines(example ..All the X-Men movies).<br />This movie had very good flow and the whole family( ages 5yr,8yr,35yr and45yrs) liked it .
B000056K04|5.0|Love DMB! I got this cd and cloud access too and it was cheaper than buying just the cd! Cant go wrong!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Great Anime, but the story was weak. Seems like the same old same old story, try to think  up something new (original). Or due what everyone else is doing, Steal a story that has allredy worked from England or Europe.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Thjis story of Alice and the disease that eventually consumes her was such a beautiful, sad story but I learned so much about Alzheimers which I am truly grateful for as my hubs is suffering and I could identify with so much and Ms Genova helped me to understand why some things happen and how the sufferer feels and thinks. An excellent read even for those not touched by this horrific disease.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Outstanding book, using the book with my reading circle.  Students are really enjoying the book.  It works well on my kindle.  I recommend the book to anyone l involved in a reading circle or group.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I found the book quite an entertaining read. I would recommend it. It is bit irreverent in parts but a fun read nonetheless

B008EZVNO0|5.0|After several weeks of listening to this cd, it dawned upon me that this music is much like the &#34;KInd of Blue&#34; album by Miles Davis: open, clean, and uncluttered.  It is a joy to listen to in any environment.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Makes shopping with Amazon a lot easier on the go. I've used this app on both Android and iPhone and both are easy to use.
B000MRA6AK|5.0|Having heard the song &#34;Poinicana&#34; on  numerous occasions, it was only upon listening to it at home did I truly grasp the sheer beauty of  the artisty of Ahmad Jamal.  I play this album daily: while reading, cooking, cleaning, as well as background when I have company.
B002H0C2T8|3.0|Rented for my wife on our date night. This is one of her favorite movies and I would recommend anyone wanting to see Johnny Depp, watch this movie. This movie shows everyone how talented of an actor Johnny Depp is and even at a young age.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game brings a lot of fun.kids have to be speedy and that makes it more entertaining.everyone can play at any age.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great love story that kept you wanting to continue reading.  There were a few night time got away from me and before I knew it it was 3:00 AM.

B000W93CHC|4.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth, this book was too much of the same. I'm enjoying it but feel some of his other work was better.
1401322786|4.0|Mitch Albom is an incredible writer<br />the novel had certain philosophical points that made me sit back and just think
B007IXWL2C|5.0|While I agree with all the hoop-la surrounding the 50 Shades trilogy, I did have a little trouble with the writing style. The repetitive use of certain words or phrases, was distracting. You are reading a story that includes Dominant/Submissive material, yet the silliness of some of the story tellers dialog sounds as though she is too young for any sexual encounter, must less THIS encounter. Ultimately it is the actually \\"love\\" story that gets you, pulls you in and makes you purchase the next book. You have that, need, to know what happens next. The author was also smart in not putting one of those cheesy pictures on the cover. Little things like that have made it what it is today. A hot but sweet fantasy love story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I liked the storyline.  It held my attention.  It was never boring...  I can't wait to read the next book!
B004U5WZG8|5.0|I love the album. Birdy is a wonderful singer who is on the verge of  worldwide stardom! I will be buying her future albums! I also  am totally happy and satisfied with the seller of the cd! The cd came quickly and in good condition!  I would shop again with them!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I like the storyline and it held my attention from the begining to the end.... I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Read this book in less than 24 hours.  Enjoyed every minute of it and wish there was so much more.

B002QKZLZ6|5.0|If you don't wear your headset all day long, this is a great way to keep it clean.  When I'm not using it, the headset ends up at the bottom of the bag.
B005LAII1C|2.0|The movie was really built up.  Everybody said it was better than the hangover.  I dont think so.  I am glad I saw it but it was not as funny as the hype.  And I'm not gonna waste 2 hours watching it again.
0375869026|5.0|This is an extraordinary read-touching, yet very realistic. It has been nominated for the teen book award, but resonates with all ages (think Hunger Games, House of the Scorpion, The Host). I've given it as a gift to several people who have raved about it. It's the story of a young boy with physical challenges, but is really a commentary on the value of family and friends and the intricate network of love and support that we all weave in our lives.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Good reading. Scalzi keeps the tone light but still manages to write an amazing story. If you liked Jim Butcher's Dresden Files you should definitely give this book a read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book will be added to my list of favorites. At first I thought I wouldnt like it becasue it was about HS kids. But the story surprisingly was very mature material. The subject matter was deep & at times a bit disturbing. Yet I loved the humor in the book. I enjoyed the interaction of Holder & Sky and the author did a great job of character development. This was just a great read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|really great game with more than you expect to do. though getting enough coins and gems is a bite but its worth it.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|The only problem is they watch it over and over and over and over.....again...  This is for  four and seven year old boys. It did not hurt that Jerry Seinfeld's son had been in one of their classes!
B007REV4YI|2.0|Started out with an exciting action sequence, with a few more sprinkled in between throughout the movie.<br />But I cannot, and will not, consider this as an authentic Bond movie!<br /><br />Why?<br />- No cool gadgets<br />- No hot chicks (spoiler alert- okay there was one, but she got killed just a few minutes after a half baked steamy scene.)<br />- lame storyline - this is quite subjective, but I was expecting a more complex storyline than the straightforward story of an ex-agent obsessed about killing M. (You know, something with more 'meat' on the plot, like Casino Royale. Something I would think about days after watching the movie.)<br /><br />Fans, before you hit the 'dislike' button for my review (or its Amazon equivalent), let me tell you that I loved Craig, Javier and M's acting, but I felt the movie fell weak on the plot part.
B005JABSB6|5.0|I own a Sharp LC60LE847U and these glasses work perfectly with this TV.<br /><br />Out of the box they WILL require charging, but this is not a major inconvenience as charging only takes 90 minutes.<br /><br />The 3D effect is good.  Do not expect the image to &#34;jump&#34; out of the TV at you.  Actually, the opposite is true.  The 3D effect seems to create depth &#34;into&#34; the TV if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with these glasses and would highly recommend them.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|real, touching and comical at times.  provocative subject matter.  sensitive subject matter, i don't think this topic has ever been<br />addressed
B00BETX5PS|4.0|As always the action in this one was top notch. The plot was weak.<br />The acting was great. And Bond failed in his mission. The bad guy got to his<br />target. And some of it was way to over the top. A detonation that drops a<br />subway train down to a lower level at JUST the right moment as to allow the<br />bad guy to get away. Sorry guys, just to cheesy. Looked like the whole movie<br />was just a set up for a new &#34;M&#34; character. Over all I liked this movie. But it<br />was just weak for a bond movie.
B001RLP862|4.0|I've had the red deck for over 2 years now. and they have held up very well over to test the time of my home games the paint has barely chipped off at all. Compared to Copag and Kem cards these are definitely up there in quality, durable, and the price point. The blue deck definitely fits right in with my red deck and my other decks of Copag. Long live cash games....
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|It kept me interested from beginning to end, it was well written and it described in such detail that I could picture what was happening
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book deserves 5 stars. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author. All his books are great. This book is by far my favorite. The ending was my favorite & I'm glad it was added in there. I would recommend this book to anyone & everyone.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|This game was not for me I am kind of a snob when it comes to the games that I like to play and this was not in my catagory.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|This movie is so unique, it bears watching.  The list of actors is surprising, such as Helen Mirren & Peter O'Toole.  I highly recommend it. Totally entertainibg.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved it! Read like Wally Lamb's &#34;I know this much is true&#34; which is one my most favorite books ever!! Would completely recommend this to everyone!  I want part 2!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I liked playing the ghost of maple creek its fun and not very time consuming something that can be played while waiting anywhere for appts. etc. and I am eagerly awaiting the second game Enigmatis 2.
1589795474|1.0|This book takes what should be a New Yorker article and stretches it into an entire book.  The book has one insight, live below your means and become a penny-pincher.  A terrible message -- become a complete miser, live a spartan miserable life, and die with a net worth of +$1 million.  Save yourself and pass this one up.
B003LL3LHO|3.0|As a fan and player of Guild Wars 2, I enjoyed this fun and easy novel. I liked being able to follow the paths of the party with the maps in game that I could easily visualize in my head. And since I had never played the original Guild Wars, it helped me learn the lore of the original game while tying it into the new one. It was entertaining and decently written.<br /><br />However, I realized at one point that I was about 75% through the book and the party hadn't even reached their destination. I feared a rushed ending with no real resolution, and that's exactly what I got. I'm quite disappointed by that and hope that a future novel ties it all up. It was an otherwise decent book.
159420411X|1.0|This book offers no real insights into forecasting.  Nate Silver got lucky by predicting a couple of elections and he has milked it way past its usefulness.  Silver has an interesting background with his baseball forecasting, poker career, and election predictions.  However, he clumsily attempts to translate his modest successes in these areas into some kind of expertise in subjects that he could not possibly be qualified to comment on in a meaningful way.<br /><br />The most disappointing part of this book is how disjointed it is.  The chapters are haphazardly thatched together with no real guiding principles.  The chapters go from the housing crisis, to weather forecasting, to baseball stats, to an overdramatized and dreadfully boring recounting of the Deep Blue v. Kasparov chess matches, to poker and sports betting.  There is NO logical thread that ties these chapters together.  I was practically pulling my hair out trying to figure out what Silver was trying to get at when I realized that he was just spewing vague information and pop-culture references that fall flat (odds of Lindsay Lohan getting arrested, yawn).<br /><br />Additionally, and many other reviews capture this point, is that the title \\"why so many predictions fail - but some don't\\" is never fully realized.  Silver criticizes almost all forecasting models with few insights on which predictions work.  The only conclusion is that Bayesian statistics are a good thing.  This book is a New York Times Op-ed turned into a 300+ page book.  Save yourself from this careless pop science and pass this one over.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|It was funny in a sad sort of way - a satirical comment on life in the USA.  Fortunately, a lot has changed since then.
1439190275|5.0|This is the book to have for the concerned weight watcher. I gives you everything you need to prepare your foods as well.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This game is addictive both for my 6 year old daughter and for me! You can use the sound effects or shut them off if you get tired of them.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game which can easily become addictive!  It has become one of my favorite games.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|You can disregard the negative comments about the PQ because the new BluRay has cleared that up.  It looks really great here.  I watched the original DVD over 100 times and i can agree that the PQ suffered there, but it didnt matter to me because the performance was so spectacular.<br /><br />This new BD is an amazing step up in clarity, keep in mind that it was filmed on 16mm film so its still not razor sharp but its very very good.  THe audio and performance is what this is all about. Gabriel in concert is second to none.<br /><br />Plus we get the performance of Red Rain here which i only had on my CD of the concert before, i onkly wish it were integrated into the concert instead of an extra.<br /><br />Get it, its the greatest.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|After struggling with calendars I have rediscovered this app. It is intuitive and basic and simple. The color coding is good for the visually inclined
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Similar to the Fox show &#34;Glee&#34;, but Rebel Wilson makes it comical. I would recommend for chick-flick night with friends.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I've been looking for a game similar to Mario for the longest time! It runs smooth on the kindle fire, controls are easy and it's just as fun as the all time favorite Mario, but with a great twist! Great job developers! I'd rate this 10 stars! BEST PART IT'S FREE! GET IT WHILE YOU CAN!<br /><br />Just so you guys know, it kinda lagged at first but picked right up once I exited and restart my game. No biggie!<br /><br />I also downloaded the second package so I know I have it ready and on standby, can't wait!  ; )
B007QDNKQA|5.0|I love this movie, I have watched it more times then I can count.  Mark Wahlberg is great in this movie with all the action. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a great action packed moive.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This was just what I needed to check my sons homework!! Now if only I can find an app that does algebra...
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|I  only purchased this book because I had read Something Borrowed. I really enjoyed  the first book so I thought I would like this one. I think the hardest part for me with the book is I didn't like Darcy's character to begin with so was hard reading from her point of view. I guess I was waiting for more Rachael. But it never happened.  All over it was a decent read.
B007549W62|5.0|Though it had its obvious flaws the darkness of the films feel is obvious including its shocking ending. A dark movie though flawed worth watching.
B007SGM084|3.0|Very repetitive through all 3 books.  A little too trashy for my taste. I think it was a waste of money.
B007ZZKWHY|5.0|Nazi's in space need I say more for a movie that's not meant to be taken too seriously.  I recommend this movie.
B00144VBBS|5.0|I love his music and play this CD all the time.  This is also in my Patriotic play list.  I try to play it every day.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I very much enjoyed seeing the second season.I purchased the first season thru my computer.  I couldn't understand the words due to the British accent, the poor sound system in my computer, and the fact tha I am hearing impaired and wear hearing aids.  Playing the DVDs using the closed captioning enabled me to follow the action.
B009LE7AU4|3.0|This probably would be great if you are a Huge Duran Duran fan. I am/was not, but as a musician was very in to his playing. He is very open about fame, drugs, success, and getting his life back on track. The book almost reads like he just needed to get some of it out in the open. Overall an ok read, but not one I would want to read again and again.
B0063GORYU|4.0|excellent. needs to be a little faster and some of the features. on my phone. are not available. on the kindle version. other than that its great
B000RUAR5G|5.0|I liked  The Space Jam Movie Thanks It is a very good movie I Cannot believe how wonderful it is

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just a great series.<br />Very well thought out and entertaining.<br />I'm glad they are continuing to keep the series going.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I like anything from Josh Groban - sometimes I enjoy his voice, sometimes the words, and I really enjoy it if both are working together.  On this album, &#34;Brave&#34; and &#34;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&#34; were really good, though my favorite was &#34;False Alarms&#34;.  The other tracks were not as outstanding, at least not to me.  Still, I was excited to get it and for a much lower price than I had expected.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My cousin reset my whole game I. Had 60 thousand coins!What do I do? HELP me I need my coins back but other than that I love this game...bye but help if you can.

B003CBTVNG|3.0|It is a funny movie but think of it as one long SNL sketch.  Will Farrell and Molly Shannon are their usual great comedians.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Amazing.  Will take some time to absorb, with many to chose from, this read I'm truly grateful.  Thank you Christopher.
1451695195|5.0|very true. like it very much. it teaches us love. it is the only university we need.Wish all people are loving and ready to share, no fear of death.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Great album, I personally prefer the raw Liveset 3 piece version on youtube over the fine tuned recording studio album but it is awesome all the same.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I FELT AT TIMES THE BOOK MOVED VERY SLOWLY.  ALSO A LITTLE, DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW WHEN THEY WERE FLYING ALL OVER THE PLACE .  HOWEVER, AS USUAL WITH GRISHAM IT'S THE UNEXPECTED THAT MAKES IT A GOOD BOK.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This is a huge issue I can not play a game for atleast just make it be for an hour or so.

B00005V9QJ|5.0|Sade is INCREDIBLE! and this live album is a must have. Growing up in the 70s I love live music. This younger generation has missed out on so much & doesn't have a clue what real music is. Her voice is amazing and her band is perfection. All of her classics are covered. Whenever I'm cleaning the house or just cruising on a long drive, I pop this CD in and chillax.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a new game to me.  I love puzzles and this one is very interesting.  Now that I have the hang of it, I just love playing it.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I side with the other reviewers who call this movie a waste of time. It's long and boring. There's not much story. Mankind's first mission to another planetary system is crewed by narcissistic punks. In classic Jurassic Park fashion, they go where they shouldn't, do dumb things and get killed. A comic book has better characters. Where is the plot and charm and suspense of the previous Alien films?<br /><br />There are pretty costumes and matte backgrounds from Space Family Robinson.  The boss alien resembles the Michelin Man. He collects black oil from the X-Files, gets raped by an octopus, and their kid looks like H.R. Giger's classic conehead. Must be a black sheep in the family.<br /><br />Let's hope humanity's real ambassadors are better than this. Let's hope Hollywood can do better than this.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It's been a while since a really good Clancy novel.  I was not disappointed in this one.  I like Mark Greaney's work as well so with the two collaborating how could you miss?
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Absolutely love this book. I read it as a class but I enjoyed every second of it especially when I read ahead :)
B00A71MUCS|5.0|This is the Monitor you want. Works great with awesome features. Worth the money for sure.<br />The interaction with the iPhone app is perfect from Anywhere!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Loved this book, would recommend it.  Easy reading, especially if your a new reader like I am, highly recommend it.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Thank you for the  quick service! I enjoy watching this movie and happy to now have it whenever I choose to watch it again and again.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a good solid read, stuck on Mars alone when a NASA trip goes badly wrong. Good science, lots of problem solving and several disasters that complicated the plot.... I thoroughly enjoyed the story and will look for other titles by this author.
0375413405|5.0|I have been wanting this book for a long time. Finally ordered it. Got to my home quickly. The recipes are very well explained. I really like that Julia explains the different types of cuts of meats you can use for each recipe. It is a wonderful book. I can't wait to make my own first meal from it. I have been lucky to have friends who use this book. And just thinking of the meals I have tasted makes me want them right now. Simple, easy, yummy, well explained, full course meals are what you will find in this book. Perfect for people who entertain and enjoy the better tasting foods being offered. You will never want fast food again.

B0089AD8IO|4.0|I always forget how much I enjoy this first series of new Doctor Who. Christopher Eccleston puts up a strong and quirky performance and Rose acts as a good audience surrogate to the world. The best episodes (Dalek, The Empty Child, The Doctor Dances, Boom Town) far outweigh the weaker (Aliens of London, World War Three, The Long Game). The finale is fun, if a little weak, but definitely enjoyable. It is no surprise that this series sparked Doctor Who's surge in popularity.<br /><br />The set comes with mimi-Doctor Who Confidential episodes that detail the making of episodes. It also contains trailers, commentary and other stuff that might interest fans. This is a great set that's sure to satisfy a modern Who fan.
0670026603|5.0|Very good and it gives you a lot to think about.  The subject is covered with humor and consideration.  I would recommend this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is a very good author.  The way this book was written is sooo good you will not be able to put it down until you're on the last page.....I felt the pain, the love, the lust being portrayed by the author in this book.

B005LAJ23A|5.0|Shipped within the time stated.<br />Was as marked in the descriptions with no surprises.<br />Had clear picture as you would expect from a blue-ray.<br />I enjoyed re-watching the series thus far as I bought both season 1 and 2.<br />Can't wait for season 3 to come out for I can see it.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|We saw this story on TV and had to get the book. It definatly makes you think about different cultures and what people go through.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|What a terrific series. We do not have Showtime, so the cd's are great. I recommend the series to anyone.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I remember reading this book as a child and I remember Jo as being my favourite.  I can't believe I haven't changed my mind about that.  It is stunning in that it has so many words I had to look up.  Such a shame that novelists  today are discouraged to use such language.  It is easy enough to read and I would imagine it would be a great one to read to young girls piecemeal on holidays.  I really enjoyed it.
0374531943|5.0|From what I've read and viewed of Michael Collins, he always seemed like a down-to-earth & funny guy; this book is no different!<br />I'm thankful to read his own words describing his experiences as a test pilot, joining the U.S. Air Force, becoming an astronaut, flying on missions Gemini 10 & Apollo 11 and thereafter.<br />I loved how I was able to connect to his words as if I were having a conversation with him...or reading his diary.  He \\"speaks\\" freely & honestly.<br />There are times when the words get a bit technical & over my head describing, for example, how the command module operated or a space-related formula.  I had to reread a couple times, thinking \\"wha-?\\"  Taking away a decent understanding, his explanation of such hard-to-grasp technicalities only highlight the complexity of their endeavors.  I remain in awe & amazed at the amount of work, time, effort & courage poured into these missions.<br />This period of NASA seemed like a bustling & motivated one, and you learn of various characters/personalities involved and the daily tasks & commitments made in reaching a goal as a country--the moon.<br />I was also excited to learn more about the Armstrong/Aldrin/Collins dynamic, and Michael does well in giving you a sense of their (commonly characterized as \\"amiable\\") relationship.  As such, they were a talented, dependable and fearless team I am forever proud of.<br />And this will definitely remain one of my favorite books.<br />x
B004M5HUXE|5.0|I can see what all the fuss was about when it was written and even today I find some of the dialogue mildly shocking: in other words I wouldn't normally read such words.  However, the general style is not too superfluous, like say Jane Austen.  Much easier to read.  I found it to be a real page turner.  Love it.  Recommend it.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Loved it!  It's very calming and the voice is spectacular. I love the music.  It's a great CD. I recommend it.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm trying not to give away anything in my review so some of it might seem vague.<br />In the hand of any other author the secret between Dean and Sky might seem derived. In Colleen Hoover's hand however it was totally believable and beautiful. Not the dark parts but the connection that they shared.<br />If you purchase this be sure to start reading it early because this is one of those books that will keep you up at 5 in the morning trying to finish it before you have to get ready for work.

It's no walk in the park, but it works!

B0042JSSVI|4.0|You never quite know how much of Robert Harris stories are fact and how much fiction.<br /><br />Pompei was another riveting Harris read, the excess’ of the Roman empire set against  the last hours of Pompei. Perfectly credible, probably more fact than fiction I thought.<br /><br />You don’t drown in characters in a Harris book. Whilst there is a good range of players, they are all relevant and not too many. Water was a character in this book.<br /><br />Harris’ characters always travel a bit so there’s often a map. My experience is that Kindle doesn’t really do graphics like photos & maps so this was lacking in my Kindle copy. I’m lucky enough to have been to Pompei so I could visualise the places the book travelled through but others would have to look at a map.

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I'm not sure anyone had high expectations for this movie, but I saw that it had a lot of good reviews so I wanted to see if it was any good.  And as a lot of others mentioned it is an entertaining action movie.  It's not like the original Stallone movie at all, but goes on it's own story line. I wish they had gone into more of Dredd's background, but I guess it would be reserved for a sequel, which unfortunately I don't think will happen.  I would totally watch a sequel of this movie.

B00AYB1RGG|3.0|A mindless joyride of blood, violence, explosions, and action sequences that look great but rely too much on slow-motion and exhibition at times when the story needs to be moving forward,  instead gets boged down by its on indulgences. Albeit, its fun and knows what it is, I felt no attachment to its lead protagonist ,no real story arch , except maybe Dredd's partner whos character seemed a little out of place at times, but had a more interesting back story.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|I had previously purchased a LifeProof case from the same retailer I purchased my iPhone 4s. I loved it. As a result, I purchased a pink LifeProof case for my girlfriend's iPhone 4s. Her case is horrible. There are bulges and bubbles in clear plastic over the touch screen making it very difficult to use the phone. Worst of all, the phone's camera will not work properly with the case installed. Pictures are dark and extremely blurry. I have tried cleaning the case with no effect. This new case is such poor quality I am suspicious that it may be a \\"bootleg\\" version.
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|Fun, simple, entertaining.  For me, easy (prob. BECAUSE the tilt control was so smooth, easy, and comfortable...and I like that sort of thing).  I finished the whole game, including all the accomplishments, in less than a day (off and on playing) and in probably 1 hr.(?) of total game-play.  So I would have liked it to be more difficult and a little more varied, too, as well as with more levels.  Its beauty is simple with relaxing music much like an Orisinal game, for those who know of these.  And so the game-play is not overly 'exciting' (like Temple Run, for instance), but more relaxing..  I thought I would keep it on my kindle fire as the arcade games have some replay value for me, but I was bored with it...  Even so, I liked the experience and nothing is wrong with the price.

B006UIUJ2A|4.0|I found this book compelling, tragic and an almost unbearable read.  I don't want to believe it has any truth in it but I am convinced that is based on real facts that we should be made aware of. What a terrible world some live in that they can be made to be so cruel to others from fear what they might suffer if the don't conform.<br />The format of the book I found confusing at first but eventually understood why it was used.

B008M721MS|1.0|I am really peeved that the Skype download for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 does not allow for you to add the area/local code, so that you can obtain a number for your device on the local network.  This renders video chatting with other friends on Skype useless, since they have no contact number with which to reach you.  I tried to delete it twice and reload the application, and even tried the android application.  Nothing I did corrected the problem.  If you don't put the area code in and just have the state, like Texas, it gives you a phone area code for San Antonio, which is 5 hours away.  Someone needs to seriously look at this and make a correction to the app., or give us a way to fix it.  Skype is one of the main video chatting apps that most people use.  Had I known it was useless I would have spent my money on the Ipad, but i figured all i needed was to video chat and didn't need to have a camera on the back for vidoes and pictures that the Ipad includes.  At least Ipad can use SKYPE!  I'd give this app a zero if it allowed....

B000K7VHQE|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine is a comedy/drama road film written by Michael Arndt and directed by husband and wife team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. It follows the dysfunctional members of the Hoover family, Richard (Greg Kinnear), his wife Sheryl (Toni Collette), and their two kids Dwayne (Paul Dano), and Olive (Abigail Breslin). Along for the ride are Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carell), and Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin), as they travel in a yellow van to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant so the daughter Olive can compete. Each member of the family brings their own brand of humor and tragedy to the mix. This film is a prime example of how dark comedy should be done, the film has it's fair share of dark, sad, and tragic scenes, but these moments are balanced with a healthy amount of light and humor to keep the film from being too depressing. While each  member of the family have their own issues to deal with, Frank, Dwayne, and Olive are, by the end of the film, clearly the most tortured of the bunch. Frank is probably the darkest Steve Carell I've ever seen, being used to seeing him in shows like The Office and films like Date Night and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, in this film he plays a rather subdued, introverted man who is clearly disturbed and in need of help, he kind of reminds me of myself, who has a long history of psychiatric problems, minus the suicidal tendencies. Paul Dano's portrayal of Dwayne as an unhappy teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his goal of being an air force pilot, is both subdued and very emotional, particularly after he discovers he's colorblind. The youngest member of the family, Olive, brilliantly portrayed by the lovely Abigail Breslin, is clearly affected by all of the dysfunction which constantly surrounds her, as she suffers from obesity and low self-esteem, and her weird, and slightly disturbing dance towards the end also shows how messed up she really is. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, with it's hilarious comedy and oddly sympathetic characters. The few things that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating was that it was a little too vulgar at times, especially in certain scenes involving the grandfather Edwin, who is a world war 2 veteran thrown out of a retirement home for abusing heroin, and Dwayne, who, after he breaks his vow of silence, tends to swear far too much for my tastes. It almost seems as though he picked up where Edwin left off after he died. The acting was decent all around, and the film has a good balance of comedy and drama, unlike some other supposed \\"dramedies\\" like Everything Must Go and Margot at the Wedding, which are basically dark dramas with a few funny scenes added in to lighten the overall mood. A well-deserved 4 stars.larious comedy and oddly sympathetic characters.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|I'm off to read the second book, but know that while Martin is a wordsmith, he's also overbearing with his length at times. Skip a chapter of a little girl running around town? Yes. Skip a meeting in a King's hall? Please!<br />Of course, I'll take all of that to read the intricately-woven plotline that he has going. It's no secret that he is crafting the modern classic of fantasy literature. Enjoy!

After the first episode of Season 3, I purchased this, and we watched it voraciously to catch up.  Beautifully produced, directed, and acted.  Loved the supplementary information included about the house and the cast.  I will probably watch it again (also downloaded it onto my Kindle fire).  If you love period drama, you will love this.

Dan might want to use that for the rewrite because for me it came rather sudden.

Like in his other works he provides excellent back up and followup resources. Excellently done and highly recommended.

I immediately feel for Ralph and his situation. From then on, I am involved with his journey.<br /><br />Has one of the saddest scenes in animated history...I think only Mufasa's death in The Lion King can beat it.<br /><br />I am trying to think of a critique...nope, can't think of one because the movie is that good. I saw it twice in theaters.
B00846F1YW|2.0|This was an ok hidden object game until I got to a level that one of the objects was under the top banner.  This happened in the first Mysteryville also.  It appears the kindle fire screen is not big enough.  I spent twenty minutes trying to get under that banner.  It is not that good of a game to keep me working on it.  I deleted it and posted this review.  The directions are useless for helping you out with this.  I could not get the screen to move down to get that.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This book made me so happy! The love story of a prim, overly-rational heroine and the good man who fell for her because of her brains... There simply aren't enough books like this out there nowadays!! I love Ms. Milan's stories for her characters, and this story does NOT disappoint!<br /><br />Oh, how I adore this story!!!!!
B005LTDPJI|4.0|Although I grew up to all the hits, I can remember sitting in the back of the family car and hearing &#34;Telephone Line&#34; for the first time.  I never really bought the albums because around the time I started buying 8tracks and LPs ELO was hitting their &#34;Disco? Very&#34; phase and besides what I had to endure on the radio I didnt want more.<br /><br />Years later as an avid underground recording collector I began to collect the Lampinski series of recordings and in them were 2 recordings of ELO from 74 and 76 that absolutely blew me away.  I bought this collection to fully expose me to those early albums and after a few listens I was not disappointed.  I pretty much stopped at Disco?very but really enjoyed those records leading up to it and would certainly recommend this box set to any real fan or fence sitter.  For the money you are getting some fantastic recordings with personal liner notes from Jeff Lynne, cant beat it.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Incredible movie. My kid watched this in high school a couple of years ago and I finally watched it. I'm so glad!!
B005L12SB2|5.0|Sadly CDs are fading away and in their last gasp we are seeing these fantastic box sets by the very best bands the era has to offer.  Kansas, ELO, BOC, and more released in multi disc boxed collections that are compact on your shelf, light on your wallet and fantastic to your ears.  This is an absolutely brilliant collection that has me spinning Kansas at home for the first time in a long time, and it was long overdue.
B00AIBZLVY|2.0|Kids are scary. That's a general rule of thumb in most horror films. But what's scarier than children? How about a mother, more specifically, a horrific ghost that adamantly protects her young? That's pretty unsettling, too. However, there is also a popular rule of thumb where you don't show the monster until the end of the movie, and when you do, the payoff had better be worth it. Guess which rule \\"Mama\\" violates?<br /><br />\\"Mama\\" centers around two girls who were abandoned in an old cabin in the middle of nowhere. And by \\"abandoned\\", I mean that their father kidnapped them, brought them to said cabin, and was about to kill them before someone (something) intervened (mutilated the father) and decided to take care of the children themselves. Long story short, the children's uncle finds them after 5 years of searching, and when taken into his care, something else tags along. That premise alone is an interesting one made moreso by the idea that at the time of their rescue, the children behaved in the same manner as the apparition that watched over them. Observing how the two girls move, communicate, and interact with their new surroundings is equal parts fascinating and frightening, like peering into a window where something more sinister lurks inside, and just out of your line of sight.<br /><br />And, for a good portion of the film, it does pull that idea off successfully. There are some clever implementations of common horror elements (with a few cheap jump scares thrown in) as well as a few uncommon ones as well. However, there is only so much unique fabrics you can use before you get to the end of the tapestry and discover that you've run out of good threads. But rather than substituting uniqueness for something a little plain, yet visually digestible, someone else does a hack job at the last minute, resulting in the entire body of work unravelling at a rapid pace until only a heap of rubbish is left. That analogy accurately describes the last third of the film,which is so laughably absurd, that it would fit more into the category of parody than anything else. This problem rests largely with how \\"Mama\\", the spirit that took care of the girls, is presented to us. Instead of having a terrifying demeanor and equally frightening looks, \\"Mama\\" looks like a cross between the Wicked Witch and a deformed cabbage patch doll. Just as unintentionally humorous is when the film attempts to provide a backstory for her. Instead of being insightful or, dare I say it, engaging, it's so embarrassing and poorly conceived that it would've been a better idea if it had been left to the audiences imagination.<br /><br />It is noted that Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy) produced and presented this film to a wider audience. Normally, it would be surprised that such a talented director would associate himself with this mess, but looking at his past production effort (the highly disappointing spanish film, The Orphanage), the shock is less severe this time around.<br /><br />With all that said, \\"Mama\\" is a waste of something that could have been much more. If they had provided an ending that wasn't plagued with ham-fisted writing, awkward scripting, and laughable \\"horror\\" sequences, then \\"Mama\\" would've been considered a decent, but interesting, horror film. Instead, it's like a moth driven to the flame: something that manages to get off the ground, but meets a horrific end soon after.
B008S80OU2|5.0|As a long time BOC fan this collection allowed me to finally get rid of all my old, pre-remaster, mostly Columbia Record and Tape Club era collection and enjoy all remasters with bonus tracks in one tidy little package.  My old eyes cant read the info on the miniLP covers but the booklet has all that and more.  The DVD was a bit of a disappointment as any long time BOC collector would already have this complete show in their underground collection.  But what the hey, I bought this package for the audio.<br /><br />As CDs breath their last dying gasp I think we will see more of these low priced box sets (i have been buying a lot of them lately) appear and that will be the last time ever released on physical media.  I guess I am old school and I like my CDs (first home deck was 8track) so you can have your downloads and clouds and mp whatever....  give me these great remastered but low priced collections of physical media and I can make my own mp3.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have read every book from this series and by far this was the best and all of them where good
B002OG5GT8|5.0|I was looking for a slight boost for my Nexus 7 to amplify the audio of some of my movies (recording level was too low) so I can watch them on my daily rail commute.  The Fiio E5 is perfect.  Amplifies without distortion - perfectly clear even with cheap headphones.  Total boost is way above my needs.  Great product!!!

B002ZG99N6|5.0|I love Ben Affleck!! This is a great movie about crime, getting away from the Mob, and falling in love with someone you shouldn't.  On the edge of my seat during this movie!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's great like the first but hardly different enough to be its own game. Same characters, same upgrades, the only changes are different graphics and the mine, which I enjoy. I was glad when I didn't have to pay for gems, though.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This movie is amazing!! I saw it in college and it is great!! Looking at when it was made, it is amazing that there are computers and animation in the movie! The creator is a genius!!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This works better than I expected and isnt as bulky as other reviews made it sound. So pleased and couldnt be happier with it. Great to have it in my pocket during a meeting and then its fully charged for the rest of the days tasks.
B002ZG997C|1.0|Bought this movie on a whim because a friend was always talking about how great it is.I had it on for MAYBE 30 minutes and shut it off.  I've never put it in my DVD player again.  I just wasn't into it!
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Never read a book like this but was intriguing and was awesome to see the differences from the show. Would recommend it to walking dead fans who have only watched the show like myself.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I had this movie on vhs and wanted to get it on dvd but I could never find it in the stores. I was so excited to find it on amazon! I can't wait to watch it this year!
B002KSA4F6|1.0|For some reason the blu ray did not play in my PS3.  Maybe it is not truly region free.  But, the Life series itself is truly 5 stars
B000001FK3|5.0|This was great in when it was first released and it is still great. He is an amazing musician and I love his music.

B005EHILV4|4.0|This thing is cool as heck. Good for the DIY  persons. I recorded my whole album in my living room with this thingy. My voice came out decent even though I was using a cheap mic. This thing is good for any person who is beginning to work in voice recording.

B004HW7JH4|5.0|Always so good! Great way to end a season, new, story line with out hurting the quality of the show.
B006XOBFJC|5.0|I had been looking for a reasonable version of Wagner's ring and this is the only one I've found. I've only listened to a little bit, but from what I have the sound quality is very good. If you want the Ring without spending hundreds, I think this is your best bet.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|we love, love this story, watch it once a year, thought we should just buy it.. It's all about the love.
B00821OX98|3.0|I stopped watching when the survival effort couldn't stop using &#34;magical thinking&#34; that assumed everybody will play fair, and everything will turn out OK if they just CARE deeply enough.
B00821OX98|5.0|All very likeable character's in series one of Falling Skies.  The series has a lot of tense moments.  The \\"skitters\\" are real scary creatures.  Sure would hate to meet up with one of them on a dark street.  Very nice color and sound on my 8.9\\" HD  Kindle.
B00881VLCE|1.0|as soon as I downloaded this app my ANTIVIRUS stated going nuts I did not even open it took app off right away. if you don't want your device hacked up leave this one alone.
B009X01C64|5.0|It is a great case, protects well and provides multiple viewing options.  My husband bought a different case and after seeing my case and how great it is, bought one too.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|So, okay, I love the concept and execution of the set. It's a simple set with a single Blu-Ray format case housing first the Blu discs, then the DVDs, and coming with a single UV redemption code for the whole season in high def.<br /><br />It comes with a couple bonus features on both the Blu / DVD discs (last disc, I think?)...<br /><br />Overall, I like the execution. I think this is how things should generally be released going forward. Kudos on that, WB! Blu for high def, DVD for low-def or for sharing with friends who haven't yet upgraded and UV for online streaming or downloadable personal digital copy. Kind of like future-proofing. Makes sense to me.<br /><br />However, I'll note that, for whatever reason, the 'high def' video quality doesn't seem all that great. Especially watching on UV via VUDU (haven't tried yet via CinemaNow to see if the same problems persist via a different UV ecosystem provider). It's especially apparent on the pilot episode, but seems endemic. While it's high def there seem to be lots of compression artifacts abounding making he picture look pretty poor quality, especially noticeable on my 60\\" TV when you get right up close. It looks pretty bad...<br /><br />So, I put in the Blu-Ray just to compare. It looks *a bit better* on Blu-Ray proper, but there's still quite a bit of graininess. So, I'm a bit disappointed. I don't know if it's 'cause the original was shot at lower def and upgraded, or whether the transfer just wasn't done cleanly from film or whatever.<br /><br />I haven't yet looked closely at season 2 Blu's yet to see if the problems persist with the transfer. I'll take a look more closely at some point and find out.<br /><br />Overall, though, I love the set and the show itself. And since one sits the better part of 8-10 feet away from the screen the artifacts aren't terribly noticeable at that distance. Right up close it's VERY noticeable, especially streaming, probably due to compression algorithms being somewhat 'lossy?' But I can forgive it sin ethe overall set is great.<br /><br />Can't wait for Seasons 3-4 to update to the Blu+DVD+UV format, since it looks like they were originally released in Blu-only format (no DVD or UV). Once you ship 'em that way (combo pack), I'll pick 'em up, very few questions asked. As long as they're done as well as these are. I'm all for it! And the combo-ness is a good thing, sinec my friend who loves the show hasn't yet upgraded to a Blu-ray player and he LOVES the show too, so with the combo pack, we can still enjoy them over at his place and laugh our butts off for hours on end. Thanks!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was a little slow to get going but once it did I really enjoyed the story and the characters.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a really good book! It was your typical drunk night setting but it turned out to be very good and consuming.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm a fan of the series so far and this has definitely been my favorite of the first three books.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I bought this for my son and he loved it! It made a great Christmas present! I will be buying other albums in the future...
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|I knew the outline of the plot (doesn't everybody?) going in, yet the movie was as interesting and dramatic as I have seen.  The actress playing the CIA agent holds the entire movie together and does a superb job.  The fact that a woman is the central protagonist in a violent movie, makes for interesting takes on the drama and feminism -  there's no off-duty whooping-up, letting off steam, at most there's a dinner with colleagues (which ends in an explosion), the scene at the end where the pilot asks `where are you headed', I presume was meant to be a question about the USA, but I came away thinking `will she be able to settle down and have a family' (sorry).<br /><br />There has been a lot of comment about the torture scenes, I think the film is pretty clear that the intelligence picture of Bin Laden's associates was gained by torture, and that the torture itself involved physical and psychological elements.  It looked pretty brutal to me, though its impact on the torturers seemed underplayed - surely it depraves both the victim and the inflictors?  If anything the torture sessions seemed to have been tamer versions of reality - there are some similar, though more graphic descriptions from a recent book by Stuart Couch called The Terror Courts: Rough Justice at Guantanamo Bay.<br /><br />I thoughts some parts of the script were a bit weak - why does the central character have to swear when she is at her first meeting with the CIA director and others after having found the safe house?  Is it really credible that the CIA would have to bribe a Kuwaiti with a sportscar, to get a telephone number?  On this one, I presumed it was too crazy not to have been true.<br />Why does the CIA director find her in the canteen and ask her what else she has done for the CIA? When she replies `nothing', he says `you are very good at that'.  What is this about?  Is he trying to undermine her analysis ?.  It seems like a worms-eye view.  I can't see Leon Panetta doing that.  Still it was good to see Tony Soprano again, though I'm worried about his weight.<br /><br />These, however, are just quibbles.  The movie was excellent, the pace was terrific, the plot was very tense, the main character (on the whole) was very credible.  I would watch this again.<br /><br />I left the cinema thinking that we know this story so well, and its so controversial that I wouldn't be surprised if its an elaborate hoax, that Bin Laden might have been betrayed by some members of Saudi Intelligence or his extended family (a number of his wives were in the house) and that this is a cover story which protects them from retaliation.  But that's real-world stuff, the movie is excellent either way.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I bought one of these to enhance the sound from my computer to my headphones.  The difference between the sound quality with it and the sound quality without it is night and day.  I loved it so much I bought 2 more.  One for my wife's car and one for my office.  With this amp, it makes my wife's stock stereo system sound much better when she has her phone connected to the stereo system.  I considered replacing her speaker system prior to buying this amp but with it improving the sound quality as much as it does, it's a cheap alternative to buying new speakers.<br /><br />It's amazing how much power this little thing packs.  It's a must have for anyone who uses headphones on a regular basis.
B009AMANBA|2.0|I saw Zero Dark Thirty in the same week as I saw this film, in both cases I had a good idea of the plot beforehand, yet the Bin Laden movie was gripping and dramatic, whereas Lincoln was leaden.<br /><br />But first the good bits, it definitely made me want to read the book Team of Rivals.  The details of why Lincoln needed the Amendment, after he had declared Emancipation are well explained,  (though not really through Dialogue, the explanation comes in a meeting, but it was as if Lincoln was reading a paragraph from the book).  I had read William Safire's Emancipation long ago, and while it was a wonderful read, it stopped at the Declaration. This film gives some idea of the sheer difficulty of eradicating the conditions which rendered slavery normal.<br />The other good bit is Daniel Day Lewis' acting.  He brought Lincoln to life as a gangly, astute, manipulative, wise-cracking, tortured man.  I think Day Lewis is overpraised, and I thought his last two roles in `There will be Blood' and `Gangs of New York' were outrageously over the top, but this was good.  A lot has been made of his accent, which I think is decent - but I did think it slipped back into Anglo-Irish when he raised his voice to Mrs. Lincoln.<br /><br />So overall though  I thought it was undramatic, and overly respectful.  I couldn't figure whether the story was asking us to  focus  on  Lincoln or Congress or Slavery.  Lincoln is given great wedges of text, but very little cut and thrust, he tells a few tales, but we know however close the vote, he will succeed.  The Congress debates are failures in two ways - the anti-Amendment side is not treated with any understanding - this may be a signal of the USAs ability to change completely, rendering the anti-Amendment arguments incomprehensible to today's generation - but as a result the opponents are portrayed as Caricatures, we get no feeling for the vehemence of their opposition. Also the debates are highly stylized, I presume the language is authentic to the times, but comes across as arch and false, the multitude of characters themselves - some manipulative, some fearful, some corrupt , all with huge amounts of facial hair, add to the strangeness.<br /><br />One of the characters says that if this amendment passes, whatever would come next  - voting for Blacks?  And the congress gasps,  Intermarriage?  More gasps, votes for women ? Outrage.  Ok , so we think they are dinosaurs, and this scene is sort-of played for laughs,  but I think the film would be more honest it could portray their fears more clearly.  Even Tommy Lee Jones, who has a goodish movies, goes home and hops into bed with his black servant, who, we presume, would be his wife if such a marriage were allowed, but we know the actress as the tough police lieutenant from Law and Order, so even this seemed (to me) to fall flat.<br /><br />And then, there is the Spielberg emotional manipulation -  we all know that when Lincoln is leaving for Ford's theatre, that its his final journey.  The scene shows Lincoln walking away  framed against a starry night sky seen through an arched window.  I looked to me like Spielberg was trying to say `See his going towards History now!', but it conjured up for me a scene from ET.  We also see Lincoln's Butler well with tears as Lincoln leaves - but as far as the Butler knows, he's just off for a night out.  Oh dear.<br /><br />So overall I think the movie fails for not knowing what its purpose is, we are not convinced about the depth of the arguments on each side, about how precarious the vote was, and because I think the makers are too concerned to be respectful to the past and  faithful to the facts without showing us the life and death drama of the times..
B00BHAVRDG|5.0|I think that when the writers introduced the character \\"Michonne\\" to the cast of the Walking Dead it did SO much to create and renergize this show.  Every time I see her in action, chopping off heads of the dead with that kick-butt sword and basically creating a this one woman army against the army of the dead... I just get such a kick out of her personality and character performance.<br /><br />Michonne reminds me so much of Uma Thurman in \\"Kill Bill,\\" which is one of my most favorite kung fu flicks, when I watch her in action.  I have a feeling MANY of you out there that love this show really dig her too.  You cannot but love this quite yet physical woman.  She is Xena, Black Mamba (Kiddo), and Wonder Woman all in one.<br /><br />SPOILER:  I just got through watching \\"HOME\\" and I was thinking to myself of how the action was getting a bit slow, but then the writers blow me away again with the attack on the prison and I find myself once again gripped by the drama and action pack fighting and the brutal struggle against not only the dead but the wretchedness of Woodbury's governor!<br /><br />Can't wait until next episode, I have a feeling its time for revenge against the Governor's well armed town.  And just between us, I think Michonne is very, VERY fond of Andrea and would not be at all surprised to find out she confesses her feelings for her later in the season. Could be wrong though?<br /><br />Keep the drama coming AMC and well done with casting Michonne!  =)<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!!  It's addicting and a great way to feel close to my own horse when j travel!!
B000P6PVLC|2.0|Random art film with no plot and no point.  I like art films like no country for old men.  But this one wasn't going anywhere.  I hung in there until almost half way through but I couldn't do any more.  Maybe it gets really good and maybe I'll come back to it.  But I doubt both because I'm not the only one that thought it had no point.  I can watch almost anything but this thing is boring.
B00A83075M|5.0|This was an excellent film. These animation films I believe are some of the best out there. Especially compared to all of the dumb horrors and gory films that come out every week. Fun and enjoyable for the whole family.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|The animation is so well done and it really is fun to watch, so I almost gave it a 4.  But it seemed a bit too long to me, and I was more than ready for it to end.  I'm not sure who the right audience is for a movie like this.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Matching game.  Fast pace but not too hard. I would like more games on this game. Can be fun but not to much to it.

B0042FZOFU|5.0|These are classic movies, and this blu-ray box set was a bargain.  My kiddos loved opening these on Christmas morning, and have watched them over and over since.  We didn't want all the extra features, so this set was perfect.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I've got a friend with Aspergers tendencies.  He recommended the book and it was not only a delightful read so very insightful.  It really helped me understand that we don't all interpret information the same way.  An investigation of an innocent mind.

B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|I have been a HALO fan for years and enjoy the books and games.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this movie -  unique story, good acting and quality special effects.  However, this is not an action movie, although the action picks up at the end.  My wife also enjoyed the movie and knows almost nothing of the HALO universe.  Hopefully we will see 343 make another film.

B00821OX98|5.0|I had always wanted to watch this show, but didn't want to pick up in the middle.  I signed up for Amazon Prime and am quite happy I did.  This show proved to be worth the wait.  I love it.  It's a good story with good writing and doesn't have the lull episodes many shows suffer.

0425263908|3.0|I'm not so sure I liked this book.  It was way to close to the 50 shades books.  I understand that it was suppose to be like them...but exactly like it?  No thanks!
B00ANW33CM|1.0|This is not mahjong.  With this game you have to turn the board around to find matches.  It's impossible to remember where anything is because you are constantly turning the board.  If you want a matching game that makes you dizzy and annoyed, get this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Ease of use in any app is the measure of success and this one does.<br /><br />Keep up the great work!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I use this app a lot.  It has a lot of different sounds to choose from.  You can set it to turn other sounds off while it is running so you won't be interrupted during a nap or when going to bed.  You can set it to play for a certain amount of time of your choosing, or have it set to turn off at a certain time.  It also has a fade out function so the sound fades out so it doesn't just go quiet all of a sudden.
B001886LQU|5.0|the amazing part is that at times, there are stills of past monster movies. one is the ant from them. another is king Kong. the 3rd and final one is the beast from 20,000 fathoms.
B00280LYIC|5.0|5 star or more I had fun reasons this book thanks to a audio book on YouTube  from PersephoneHades99. Cody Kirkham
0345803485|1.0|Five Reasons Not To Read This Book:<br /><br />The book is written in first person.<br /><br />I don't care for books written in first person. I feel that it is amateurish and limits character growth because the viewpoint is restricted to the narrator.<br /><br />Poor character development.<br /><br />I found myself liking the characters on one page and not liking them on the next. Christian Grey is charming one moment then cold and arrogant the next. There is nothing he can't do or have. He is the epitome of perfection - billionaire, pilot, pianist, athletic, good-looking and even philanthropic. His only fault is his complete self-obsession, which Ana seems to completely disregard because of all his other stunning qualities. To me, this makes Ana's character seem shallow; she is a poor judge of character.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is clumsy and misspoken one minute then witty and confident the next. I found Ana boring; the complete opposite of Christian Grey. She has no likeable qualities, nothing that makes her stand out and attract a man of status like Christian. I, also, often found myself annoyed with the naive nature of Ana. Because of this, I find her desire to be dominated by Christian unrealistic.<br /><br />The author is very repetitive in her descriptions.<br /><br />I became annoyed with the word sandstone in the first chapter alone. Then came blushing, lip biting, lip curling, darkening eyes, husky whispering, etc. Oh, and let us not forget \\"double crap.\\"<br /><br />Some events seemed forced and out of place.<br /><br />I felt that the author was trying to string together a line of events that made sense as to how Christian and Ana end up in bed together. It was forced, happening in a matter of five chapters, and a lot of the events felt awkward and unfinished.<br /><br />- The scene where Jose shows up with champagne. I felt like this was meant to add depth to Ana's character, particularly why she is still a virgin and boyfriendless . However, it left me wondering why she hasn't at least entertained the idea of a romantic encounter with Jose. After all, she seems to have much more in common with Jose than Christian.<br /><br />- The scene at Clayton's when Paul interrupts her conversation with Christian to give her a hug. I find it hard to believe that the store's brother would interrupt an associate to tell her she looks good while she is making a sale. It just doesn't add up.<br /><br />- The coffee date. The dialogue is all over the place. The author tries for depth, but fails miserably.<br /><br />Ana is far too trusting of Christian far too soon.<br /><br />Christian sends Ana a package and takes her home without ever asking her address. He also traces her cell phone to find her at a bar. In my mind, this has psychopath written all over it. Kate, her best friend, even warns Ana about a not-so-good feeling she has about Christian. Although she does question it; Ana doesn't get upset, concerned or scared by any of this. In fact, after all of this, she allows herself to be alone with him in a city nearly three hours away from her home.<br /><br />Too many things didn't add up for me and the writing was of such poor quality that I couldn't get past the fifth chapter. I was also quite shocked to find out that the sexual nature of the book is one of dominance and BDSM , two things that I don't find attractive or a turn on. Maybe the books get better as they go, however, I won't be one to read them and tell you.t me wondering why she hasn't at least entertained the idea of a romantic encounter with Jose.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely amazing<br />Great for children and adults<br />I play it all do the time and so do mg family<br /><br />I would recommend anyone buying it to play it everyday for a year
B004DAV38G|5.0|Wonderful wonderful wonderful. Just watch it and see! This is one of my favorite films of all time! LOVE IT!!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was the first book I ordered for my tab so I am a little bit partial to this one
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig's Bond is less prissy and relies on grit and determination instead of gadgets and luck. Skyfall has great characters surrounded by a solid storyline and I feel it's one of the best Bond films ever. The Craig Bond films have modernized the storytelling and pacing to fit today's movie audience and the change should broaden the fan base for future films. Every actor portraying 007 has brought their own savvy and quirk to the screen, but along with Connery, I think DC really nails the role. Think of Craig's Bond as the Kirk to Roger Moore's Picard!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|NO ONE T HOS BOOK IS SO STUPID NOT EVEN YOUR MOTHER WOULD READ IT! I'M CALLLING THENPOPO ON YOU AND YOU WILL NOT HEAR THE LAST OF ME PP.S. I LOVE YOU SO MUVH
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome i whould  love for it to have more skins<br />And mods also texture packs no wi-fi to play muitplayer
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I loved this book soooooooo much p.s. I will read it again!!!!!!!!!!!and again and again and again and again p.s.  love you
B00804W5M4|1.0|I was excited to be getting this product in the mail, but that quickly changed when the product was not what I had ordered.  It was not the steelbook version of the movie, but rather the movie in a regular, plastic case.  I paid a lot of money for an item that was supposed to be a steel book, but instead got something I could have found in the store. Very disappointed with this order and seller.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I love my lightweight cover!  It's slim, not bulky,  and very easy to use.  The only problem, is that I will not stand vertically.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|good research into the life of LHO and a nice twist in acknowledging that mafia bookies can play hardball with people they think are cheating them but the shtick that the past doesn't want to be changed and that JFK's survival past 11/22/63 would somehow crack the earth with progressively worsening earthquakes which swallow entire Islands is just not believable.  Bruce Sterling hinted at a more believable outcome in Black Swan where it's mentioned that an early end to the cold war resulted in accelerated climate change with the few remaining humans clustering at higher elevations and latitudes.
B00AFEY354|1.0|I guess I am not cool or something but I thought this movie was so boring and dumb. Starts off like it might be ok but never really got good. Dont know what else to say, just lame.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Let us start by saying it was a great book well worth a read and much could be learnt about the 2nd world war that I did not know.  It is some times good to already have a bunch of characters that one is already familiar with and fond of.  How ever like most second books this one is not as good as the first \\"Fall of Giants\\" too much history was squeezed into the book. The second world war was over and I felt then there was a race on to get to to the Russians setting off their bomb and the partition of Germany.  So much was glossed over.  All in all a good read but not up to the quality of \\"Fall of Giants\\".
B00076RT24|5.0|I like the star wars sagas andthis is the first episode and worth the money to me. would recomend to other starwars fans
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|A home run of a film.  Spectacular acting, beautiful story, touching and heartfelt and cute, a joy to watch despite the occasional tear two . . .  and a fun soundtrack too.  Without a doubt one of the better films I've seen in a long time.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|best of the star wars saga. get this  trilogy pack and enjoy the best of the 6 episodes would recommend.
0470503696|5.0|i gave this as a book for a gift and it was well worth the price!  good investment and good gift

B0042J6VUS|5.0|It does the job.it sets up like a video camera stand. No more having to put the phone on the pillow now I can either lie down or sit up to look at the phone like I would television.  Good product
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Reacher is great alone - with his team he's awesome. This is one where he wins and loses. Live it!

B007XHWROK|1.0|i'm not trying to be a hater all the time, just now...this album is as bad it gets...well until he puts out his \\"comeback\\" album (and subsequent tour) in 2029.  (bieber xx anyone?)  never say never but i'll never buy anything this wanker puts out...and i buy more music than 99% of people on this planet...believe that!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|my wife is into any thing with vampires and loves these dvds she already read the books but she said the dvds are a little differt that the books
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun game, addicting.  You can spend hours on it.  It's lots of fun at any age.  Great graffics and colors.
B001G5IJVK|5.0|this goes great with my KISS collection. very cool item. and will show it off as much as possible thanks
B002RI9UBS|5.0|One of my favourite books of all time!  I love the imagination and the imagery.  I read this book so that I could go and watch the movie and I was not disappointed!  The ending was EPIC!!!
B003L77GH4|5.0|my wife likes all these movies so I got this for her for a surprise. she was really really happy
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I rate this book in my top 20 favourite books of all time!  It was interesting to get a look into the despair of a quadriplegic!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Probably not as good as her previous books which I have not read.  I read this after reading a review.  I think it should have said to read the others first to get the most out of the book.
B008L1F91A|5.0|great detail. the skin variation is great. great size. the slight dust of green on lanterns fist is great. the figures stand fine on their own but with the magnetic stands it is even better.  just wonderful!. great buy and delivered fast. two thumbs up!!
B008AX1HD8|3.0|This book certainly is not as &#34;thriller&#34; as the others but still a good read.<br />It was good reading what someone else thinks of Australia in a fiction novel.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Such a good little game too have, easy to play. Fun for all ages. Doesn't require a lot off skill to be able to play this game, relaxed environment for all you casual gamers
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|If you liked the movie, the soundtrack is worth a purchase.  To me, the music is what makes the movie.  The tunes are catchy and my 5 yr old likes it to sing along, which is great fun too.  I like to listen to music to pick out parts and see how somebody else &#34;re-arranged&#34; the music.  It's also fun to sing the different parts.  That way it's a little different every time you listen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|cus i can rate it as high as i wanted lol leave me alone  ok ojk ok ok ok ok
0061692042|5.0|The book is in very good condition. The novel ist exciting and very well written. It´s a joy to read it.
B005T87QCI|4.0|You can race and<br /><br />Create your own robot<br />And New robots are 13  and up  yes  or  no  and  fight
B006HL9G10|4.0|You'd be right not to expect to much from this app.  Quite simply it is a very good meditation timer.  It has a non jarring bell chime, (you can choose different bells) that you can set for alerts.  One to start the timer, if you wish a halfway chime, and of course an ending chime.  You should set the volume before you begin, as I'm sure you are aware that during meditation all sounds become magnified.  It is attractive, loads fast, and there is a community that you can interact with if you wish.  One suggestion I'd make would be for the app to include a quotations section.  That would give you a thought to carry with you all day.  I do not have any negative comments about this app.  It is a timer, and that's about it.  But that is just what I want it to be.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|The movie itself looked interesting, however we had streaming issues.  The video would stop about every 10 mins and reload, then stop, reload, etc.  After this happened 3 times we gave up. We had no issues with Netflix or Hulu though. I did contact Amazon customer service and they provided a quick refund.  Just a little hesitant to use Amazon for streaming again.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I installed this app on my Kindle Fire.  It works well, does all that I need it to do, and has a clean interface.  If you've worked with Windows explorer at all you will just jump right in and manage your folders and files easily.  I like it very much.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|The technical quality of the movie is great, but that quality can't make up for how tired the whole Bond franchise has become.  Of course the acting is mediocre, but you don't watch Bond for the acting.  The special effects and stunts are wonderful, as always, but can't make up for the lack of imagination in the plot and screenwriting.<br /><br />In the three Bond movies he's been in, Daniel Craig has been an enjoyable new type of Bond, a good, earthier counterweight to my favorite, Sean Connery, but he needs some help that he's simply not getting.  I've enjoyed the Bond movies since &#34;Dr. No,&#34; but unless the current torpor and lack of imagination in the productions are overcome, Bond has truly jumped the shark.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I think the lightning thief was really good because Rick Riordan  worded it very well and that the story was awesome
B002J2PB10|5.0|If you enjoy the dialog and revenge action that typifies the Tarantino experience, this is the movie for you. The second half is more interesting to me than the first but entire movie is worth watching and unforgettable.
1423140605|5.0|An amazing book i am a big fan of rick riorden and this is by far one of his best books.
B007THA4FI|3.0|i THOUGHT THE CHARACTERS WERE NOT VERY WELL DEVELOPED AND SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. i WAS DISAPPOINTED AND EXPECTED MORE FROM THE AUTHOR AFTER READING THE HARRY POTTER SERIES.
B00846F1YW|2.0|The game didn't offer any hints and it punished you for randomly trying to find the objects.  I uninstalled it right away.
B00821OX98|5.0|Awesome show and looks great in HD.  I hope there will be a Season 3 soon!  I highly recommend watching this if you like sci-fi shows.
B005HSL626|1.0|Did not like this Fruit Ninja game.  I guess I enjoy word games more.  Couldn't really get the hang of it.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|I thought that this was another excellent work done by Tim Burton.  Thank you so much for having it available online.<br /><br />It is so awesome!<br /><br />Kelley F.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Always have my kindle with me and it is nice to have this calculator app for quick and easy use.
0345803485|4.0|I just finished the first book in the trilogy and plan to go buy the next two tomorrow. The story is absolutely addicting! It was more humorous then I expected it to be, and a little snarky which I liked. It had it's dark moments, and its VERY dark moments. But not as many as I thought there would be. It was actually a very relatable love story.  It markets a relationship as it can  be in real life, hard. Most relationships are not Nicolas Spark novels. They involve compromise, understanding, and usually come with poor timing with your current life situation. Which I thought this book depicted very well. You hate the characters when you should, and in the same breath fall in love with them as they evolve.<br /> My only complaint is the authors repetitiveness in her writing. I think she does it for dramatic affect, but there's only so many times you can read glare, chin lift, and body wash in one story. Other then that, I'm excited to read the next two novels.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Use this alarm clock all the time on my kindle.  Great reminder and extremely handy when you're busy doing other things and lose track of time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. I have recommeded this book to so many people!<br />It was hard to put the book down!
B0095P3ULC|1.0|Standard Michael Bay garbage. Totally removed from the original idea, especially concerning Optimus Prime's character. The ideals the character originally stood for are completely ignored in favor of kill shots and 'Murican tough guy crap.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice and easy to play, lots of options including making it as easy or hard as possible, no-one to play with? Play with yourself!
B007EECSFA|4.0|This story keeps you reading - very real and believable characters.  I enjoyed the way the author went back and forth in time and left you wanting to fnd out more at the end of each chapter.  If you enjoy a good story and a little suspense I would recommend this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game sooooooo much. Its very addictive. I play it 24/7 if u like temple run you'll absolutely love subway surfed. Ps TWERK TEAM. IM CAPTAIN.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|too much of \\"inside the locker room\\" settings....don't think it set the scene for the successful assination well..<br />the death of the truly evil UBL and what he had done was sublimated by the mentality of the boys towel snapping locker room jocuarity
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I believe this is the best James Bond movie yet. Really enjoyed it! Would recommend it! This one has lots of action that has you waiting to see what happens next....Daniel Craig makes a great Bond!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game Ive ever played. Its awesome with a capitulate a. Thank you to the creators of this game. U r brilliant! !!!!
0688103111|3.0|This was difficult to find. It is an autographed edition. It is now rather dated, having been written in the 90's and, true to form, Bill does a lot of walking. It had amusing moments, but I'm not sure I would recommend it. I have enjoyed his more recent books.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This is a blend of instrumental and electronic music that definitely breaks the mold. I haven't had this much fun with electronic music since the early days of Trance/Trance-Progressive. This music evokes positive feelings.  Everything about it is lively, positive, and uplifting.  Perfect music for exercise, dance, and crafting. I'm looking forward to Lindsey's next release.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Have always loves to do puzzles and this is the perfect way to do them, nice and easy.  thank you.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|season two is a really great season for stargate SG1 the third to last episode is my favorite of all.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I really loved this game until i got to the point where i had to start buying bubble to play it, so not fair.  You have a great game for all ages and you do that.  Not cool.  I took it off my kindle as I  will not pay to play a game. You can keep it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|revenge two is a very exciting season . this last episode and what happened to Amanda and jack. so sorry for Emily.
0061537969|5.0|Great book for any dog lover! The author describes the dog's emotions perfectly. Warning: Do not read the end in public and have a box of tissues ready!
B00569LSUG|5.0|It's Pink Floyd meets The Beatles with some ad T-Rex vibes thrown in for good measure. It's somehow raw and refined at the same time and the more I listen to it the more it grows on me...
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Great movie for the horse lover or anyone that has a dream that they won't give up on! Amazing story!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|T This app is very very interesting the games are in a wide variety of word games to racing to puzzles.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I think this is one of the best album I herd in a long time. Can't wait for the next.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to use and set up. I use this app daily to keep stuff organized and jot things. Great work guys!
1400062756|4.0|I was looking for a little more on the sales side of mindset, but it is a very good book for what I need it for. I would not say it is over the top.  I think the later parts of the book lag a bit.
B000NIVJEU|5.0|I love this movie. They really set you up for a sequel, I wish there had been one. But the movie does and can stand alone. Great adventure!
B0026PA05M|5.0|I can't believe i hadn't heard of this band. It is all i want to listen to. I can't wait to see them in concert.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I recommend this game for all ages. You can choose from many different characters and boards. Don't listen to the haters. This game is off the chain!!! Download this game!(It's free!)
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've bought lately... I highly recommend. I haven't taken it out of the CD player.
B0095P31L6|4.0|I don't usually watch cartoon movies but since Johnny Depp was a character, I gave it a try.  I was surprised at how entertaining it was.  The characters seemed real and were engaging.  I even recommended it to friends.
075669812X|1.0|Well, we're at a month and still waiting.  I get that there may be some reasons that things might take a LITTLE longer - let's go nuts and say twice as long, shall we?? - but this is ridiculous.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found it very good and much darker than the first two books. So many deaths but always felt that's how it would be. I wish the ending had been a little different but it's okay. Glad I read all three books.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Needed this volume to complete set.  Enjoyed entire series.  Outstanding TV series.<br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys cop/action series.

B004HD61KE|4.0|I just love books by James Rollins and this is no exception. A little (lot) far fetched by a good read. Great continuing characters.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|As soon as I got the Kindle as a Christmas gift, I knew I would need to buy a case for it as soon as possible.  The first cases I looked at were clip-ons, but all the ones on the market seem a little cheap and plastic-y and are still in the $40-$50 price range.  Considering there are hundreds of stylish and fun iPad cases, I wanted to find a Kindle case that was both functional and visually appealing.  I originally bought this carrying sleeve as a temporary and affordable solution, but I've found that I like it much more than any other Kindle case I've come across.  It doesn't clip on to the Kindle, which I like, and the lining is soft and thick enough to provide screen protection.  Plus, I love the red color!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Wish this were not the last book in the series!!!!!! Amazing, turns and twists on every page! Lots of history and facts too.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I am finding this game enjoyable and very addicting. How something that you would think is simple really tests you at times.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Not as fast paced as book one (until the end) but every bit as good, in this one you gain a deeper understanding of the characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well It is a little hard at first but then you get used to it you should also buy temple run two if you like this game
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Nicholas Sparks has out done himself again. This book was a real page turner. I can't wait to see the movie! Well done Mr. Sparks.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|The lovely language in this book is just one of the reasons why I loved it. A unique plot, fascinating  characters, and excellent descriptions. I would certainly recommend this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I seem to lose myself when logging in and exploring.  I've gotten countless recipes, hairstyles, and party ideas. I love it!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I thought I was going to by a 3D TV, but I didn't. I just watch it in 2D Blue Ray and I am impressed.
B0099114WO|5.0|...meaning.... it is understandable that, after 31 years... too much stuff can get swept under the carpet.  DO NOT LET IT and then you will not have regrets in your life.  GO FOR IT&#62;&#62; pay it forward .... and LOVE WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TO OFFER EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE&#62;  Thank you Meryl and Tommy Lee
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I never wanted this book to end. I loved every minute of it, and would recommend it to everyone who loves to read.
0525478817|4.0|This was the selection for our book club ... I really enjoyed the story line ... will make a good book club discussion
1469259192|5.0|Im hooked on Jack Reacher. Im embarrassed to admit my first exposure was the most recent Jack Reacher film. I decided to grab the first novel. It was awesome. I would sit in my parking garage  for a while because I couldn't stop listening. Im going on the 3rd novel now.
B003TJR2HS|3.0|Received the adapter a week ago and was initially very unhappy with it.  In order to get it to fit the Lifeproof cover, you have to open the connector cover past the normal limit, because there is a bulge in the back of the adapter where the Lifeproof connector cover sits while the iPhone is charging.  I crossed my fingers and went ahead and inserted the adapter, despite my misgivings, and found that it does work.  Barely.  The design of the adapter would have been greatly improved if they had flipped the plug over, so that the bulging side is facing the front of the iPhone instead of the back.  Like I said - it fits the Lifeproof cover, but it isn't a comfortable fit.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|Matilda is very entertaining and keeps you at the edge of your seat reading for hours and hours and makes it seem as if only a minute passed Roald Dahl is an extraordinarily resplendent author.Anyone would read the book and like it. I also think that the book is way better than the movie.

0547884591|5.0|I'm an undergrad in college. Heard Tim on the Joe Rogan Experience and later on London Real. He makes me think personal productivity and efficiency is the bees knees. This book isn't boring but its FULL of info. He inspires me to be great.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I came to this book (like many people I expect) through recommendations from others because I liked both [[ASIN:B00877R85I The Hunger Games]] and the [[ASIN:0007420412 Divergent]] series. As a 40-something woman, I'm definitely not the main target audience for these YA dystopian trilogies, but have enjoyed them as easy to read, escapist reads that capture the angst of growing up in a form that allows for social commentary, and 'women warrior' characters. I wasn't sure at first that this book would fit that bill, because it warms up quite slowly. Lena lives in Portland, Oregon, in a society in which love and passion (deleria) are considered a disease responsible for all the ills of society. At 18, individuals are 'cured' through an operation, and matched with a suitable mate and career to live out their life. The conditioning and social manipulation themes are interesting, and because the series focuses on love, allows for an exploration of what this really is. I won't share much more because I don't want to throw in any spoilers, but I will say that the writing is quite good - better than the other 2 series I mentioned.<br />The only drawback is that the pacing is slow - the book doesn't really get going until towards the end. I'm halfway through the second book in the series now, and it dives right in, so this seems to just be because it is the first in the trilogy. So stick with it, if you like this kind of fiction, and you will be rewarded.
030746363X|5.0|I'm an undergrad in college. Heard Tim on the Joe Rogan Experience and later on London Real. I got the book and went straight to the chapter on female orgasm hahaha. It's all true stuff and its fun to read.
B000FCKBCU|2.0|I'm usually a fan of Kinsella's books as light, escapist romps. But this one just bored me. The plot can be summed up quite quickly (SPOILER ALERT - although honestly, you learn this much in the first 2 chapters) - Samantha is a hotshot London lawyer, makes a big mistake, and ends up in the country as a housekeeper. Much chaos ensues, as she has no domestic skills, and of course there is a love interest. I think the reasons this book doesn't work for me are 1) the 'country' setting is dull, compared to the hip, urban settings of most of Kinsella's books (the 'scene' is half the fun, usually), 2) the domestic chaos is not humorous but absurd (this woman got through law school?) and has all been done before on sitcoms (bad ones), and 3) the love interest is really dull.<br />So, for me, this just didn't have the characteristics of the usual fun Kinsella romps. Oh well.

B00884GR0W|1.0|Bought the Kindle (Android) version. This game wasn't bad (a little confusing) but nothing like the PC version. Most of the Quests, the things aren't there for you to accomplish. Then, during the weekend of 2/16/2013, an update loaded and screwed up the graphics and now most of my inventory is gone.  In addition, some of the things you could do before (creating) are now locked. Addicting, but not worth it in the long run, if they are going to do random updates and mess it up even more than it was!
0451232852|5.0|I have been reading Ken Follett for years. This second installment of the trilogy continues his excellent, well researched work.
B005LAII80|5.0|I have been a Judge Dredd fan for a long time now and this movie does the character justice. The film has captured the dangerous and crazy look and feel of the comics in so many ways from the characters that it portrays such as the Mama clan, to the giant Mega City block towers, right down to the Judges uniforms, guns etc. They tweaked some things here and there, especially with the Lawmaster bikes that the Judges ride on, but that is understandable. And the story, while maybe not the most involving plot that you have ever seen, was still decent enough for what it does, which is to show you an average day on the streets of Mega City 1 for a Judge.<br /><br />The movie also introduces a well-known and favorite character of mine from the comic books, Judge Anderson, the psychic sidekick who over the years has helped Judge Dredd to solve many tough cases within the city. In this movie we see her on her very first day of duty as she is being trained by Judge Dredd to see if she has what it takes to become a Judge. She does.<br /><br />This movie was so action-packed and riveting that it literally had me on the edge of my seat the first time that I viewed it at the theater. It really made you feel what life would be like to live in such a dystopic society. Something that I would not enjoy very much I'll tell you that. This is a bleak, dreary, and oppressive world where life is tough and unemployment and the crime rate is through the roof. The Judges can only do so much to try and keep law and order in this huge overcrowded city. And Judge Dredd is the best of them.<br /><br />I am glad to see that this movie is making waves on the home video circuit because it tanked pretty badly at the box office. I hope that it's success continues to grow and that maybe if we are lucky we can get a sequel to it made in the not-too-distant future. There are many more interesting characters from the comics just waiting to make an appearance on the big screen, some that would make for very interesting villains in a future release. I am referring of course to the well-known Dark Judges, Mortis, Fire, Fear, and Death. These ghastly supernatural beings from another dimension are just dying to be seen on the big screen.y interesting villains in a future release.

B000YDI9UG|5.0|I have worn these boots for a week now and can confidently say they are the best boots I've owned. If previous reviews regarding soles wearing out prove true, I will definitely take them in for repairs. Doesn't hurt that I've already received several compliments from the opposite sex about the looks of them too!
B002R02FDG|5.0|Great Item to talk about.  One CD you can not use due to an expiration date but not a big deal.  The packaging is great.
1616550414|4.0|Love the book and all the information covered in it. I am a big video game fan and when I can learn more about the games I play it's even better. My only disappointment in my order was that the book came with clearly visible bent corners like it had been mishandled. The shipping box was in perfect condition so it had to of been before the item was boxed and shipped.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I've been wanting and waiting to read this for a long time. Pretty Intriguing. Restores faith in the goodness of human nature.

B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Denzel usually is a great actor but this flick was not that great! The story draged on and watching Danzel drink himself into oblivion was very boring. The best scenes were at the beginning of the movie.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Nothing very exciting about the story. Short book. Not sure why the main character sounded like a young boy. This might be one where the movie is better than the book. I've never had that happen, so maybe the movie won't be very good either.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Started off slow and soapy but then this show picked up! The best season of this series. Mostly because of the vampire Daman. Bad boy villian at its best. He is the show. The good vampire is a wuss and he loves Elana. He is boring. Damon is the man. The story is very good. Very good action and not like twilight. They rip out heats and break necks.Very good action and storylines. One of the best shows on tv and guys do like thiis show. If you like vampires this isa good show! Avoid that Tru Blood crap. Way better than that and Twilight is is too soft and awful as well. This is how vampires should be. They are cool. Like vampire series than this is for you.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Somewhat boring at times.  I like it better when I have not played it in a while.  This is more for a ten year old.
B0024F08RO|5.0|This season was better than season 3 which was boring as hell. Brought back  a lot of players from the first 2 seasons and got rid of a boring person from the third season. This show had good twists and a shocking ending. Wrapped everything up nicely.Overall a good series.
B005ES0XVO|5.0|Although probably the ugliest footware on the planet, I just can't find anything better than crogs for my lifestyle.  The biggest issue with croc's is when they wear  down a bit, they are like iceskate and wet smooth surfaces and very dangerous.  I bought this new style hoping then new style bottom will prevenent this.  To soon to say for sure, but they should from what I can tell.  They are also more comfortable than the orginals.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|This show was one of the best on tv for 6 years. All the twists and turns and all the questions you wanted answered was not solved. You had more questions than you had answers. It was really a weak ending. A good season but it ended flat. This svd is good to have if you loved the show and want the end to the collection. It could have been so much better.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|G5 games rock.  I love this type of game.  It had all the elements I like.  Hidden objects. Puzzles. Creepy atmosphere.  Some fun scares.  And it was just hard enough to be challenging but easy enough to play after a hard days work to unwind:-) :-)  Keep these types of games coming G5.... It was worth the price.  I know some people don't like having to pay within the game but I kind of like it because you can try it out first and if it works good on your device and you like it then you can purchase it.  If it doesn't work or u don't like it. You are out nothing:-)  sincerely. Lori M.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|This is a good series. Has a lot of sex, violence and coarse language. A good begining. Only problem with this show is it has way too much cgi voilence. The kills look real fake at times. Hate cgi. Also the plot is just a lot of fighting and killing. If you love action then this is your show. A better show is Game of Thrones. That has a better story.
037582913X|5.0|Husband had to get this book as a remembrance of childhood. Everything he remembers and more :) I like the new style of bounding for Golden Books. This order shipped fast :)
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This series was a hit and it was must see tv. The plots and mystey were very good. People were hooked . This season had a lot of action and twists. A very good villian was introduced and some shocking stuff. A action packed season that left you wanting more.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Can't Stop reading it.  I enjoyed reading Abby's point of view as to how she left home to create an entirely different future than the one waiting for her by relocating to another state, only to find what is all too familiar in Travis.  It leaves Abby refusing to admit love at first sight and fighting it every step of the way.<br />Guys always seem so stoic and unfazed until they open their mouths and you get to know how unhinged they can become. Can't wait for Walking Disaster and Travis's point of view. How did a womanizer become a one woman man? When did he realized Abby is the girl he can't live without?  Why he seemed to tailspin every time Abby walked away?  How he managed to get it together and worked through getting Abby back?
B001C4CI8U|3.0|This is another show like X_Files. A lot of weid things happen. This season was not that bad but this show never hooked me.Hated the father Walter. He annoyed me. The main lead girl was boring. Best thing in this show is the Jackson guy.If you are into deep mystery and stuff that repeats itself and weid twist then buy. Overall it is not all that Glad this show is off the air. As the show went on it got worst.
B004I744AS|5.0|app is easy to use and has a lot of info on words. very User friendly and has choices for different languages.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Not as good as the first season but it still kicked butt! Action packed and it had surprises as well. At the end it kind of got weak when they brought in some new people. Still had some good fight scences and shocking deaths. Damon is still the man to watch on this show. Liked season one then you should get season 2. A very good vampire series.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|This app used yo be great, but after recent updates I am now forced to log into the Appstore before each use.  Very annoying to have to login just to look at my calendar or add an appointment.
B000EQ5TSI|5.0|First one really sucked and was boring as hell. This one picked up the pace and action. Cruise was better. The plot made  more sense as well. Best to watch this and part 3. Part 4 really sucked and was all over the place!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Great show, love the twist on zombie apocalypse. Has a good storyline and character development. It is gory, I mean the dead are eating the living and there is blood and guts and decay but I have to say it wouldn't be a bad show for teens to watch with parents, there isn't any nudity that I recall or lots gratuitous sex scenes to make it inappropriate or uncomfortable.
B001IF252M|5.0|I got this for my macbook and it has not failed me ever! I bought another one before and it was some cheap brand and it failed after a couple of uses. I guess you get what you pay for. Getting original equipment from apple can be a bit expensive but it is worth it in the long run. This was a good investment that will last for many more years.
1451673442|5.0|The book came in grate condition, in a reasonable time and was a great read! Highly recommend this and the others of the series.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a silly little waste of time but overall challenging and entertaining. Some games are near impossible or I would give it five stars.
1608871452|5.0|It was really neat like a big scrapbook for supernatural!  I loved all the extra stuff that looks like it was just stuck in there!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I chose this book to read before going to see the movie. And still the book is better. An interesting reading on a hard topic for many to understand.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I actually put this on my kindle for my grandson who just loves it. He tells me, &#34;look maw-maw&#34; all day. Thank you for giving him another game to keep him occupied.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|JJ Abrams and friends have distilled another fantastic storytelling elixir. Brimming with offbeat and loveable characters, and canny villains, this series is screenwriting at it's, best - and uses authentic contemporary 'fringe' science to back it up! A real Gem. All the actors are genuinely engaging. Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson are great, but John Noble steals the show as the eccentric and loveable 'mad' scientist Walter Bishop.
034580404X|5.0|Loved this series....cant wait to see if she actually comes out with the rumored fourth book. all the books are sooo good
B005LAIH54|2.0|I grew up with the original Clash of the titans with stop-motion clay puppets. And that version was immensely better than the prequel of this movie with the same title.<br /><br />This could have been so much more. I just felt... empty. Bleak. Devoid of story, character and even a decent SFX budget.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game to past time with easy to play too.  Good for young children. I recommend this game to anyone
B005QN3ANK|5.0|And Aqua is back with their first album of new material since 2000's Aquarium, the boy was the wait worth it. The still contains their signature Europop but with a electro base that is more suitable for this era. The album starts off with the second single \\"Playmate To Jesus\\"  which is a downtempo electropop song. And then the album moves into some of the best songs on the album; \\"Dirty Little Pop Song\\",  track three kind of kills off the moment but it is quickly repaired with \\"Like A Robot\\", \\"Viva Las Vegas\\",  and \\"No Party Patrol\\" which are arguably the best songs on the the albums and builds a momentum that is kept for duration of the album but unfortunately is not surpass. Overall this what a comeback should like after a decade of absence from the scene.
B005K17RU0|4.0|gives me a nice quick at a glance idea of the weather, very nice and useful. accuweather is right most the time, which for weather is saying something
B005GRTNXC|4.0|Leona Lewis's third studio album Glassheart is in my opinion the best album she has put out yet. With a excellent blend of both her signature mid tempo & ballad songs mixed with electro-laden and club ready songs. The best songs on here are the ones with high beats per minutes. The album opens up with the midtempo and solo verison of the song \\"Trouble\\" which starts the album off in a good direction. But it's the uptempo electro-ballad fourth track \\"Come Alive\\"  that really kicks the album off in a new direction away from typical Leona style but keeps up with the substance of her other works. Track seven \\"Shake You Up\\" which is another dance track drop the electro for some bass me then is followed by \\"Stop the Clocks\\".  It both nine and eleven that are the albums real standouts. \\"Favorite Scar\\" which is track nine, heavily samples the 1985 song \\"Head Over Heels\\" by Tears for Fears effectively rendering it sounding both familiar and fresh. And then track 11 which is the title track \\"Glassheart\\" which is a electro heavy dance. Both the acoustic verisons of \\"Glassheart\\" and \\"Come Alive\\" sounds just as beautiful if not even more than the originals and are among if not the best ballads on the album. Overall great album one which has been in heavy rotation since I got it.

0060574216|5.0|This should be required in every public school. Helps us understand what is really going on with communication between men and women. This book changed my life.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|Since wide screen  television sets were introduced for use in homes, I have looked for the perfect family movie for a wide screen TV. The blue ray version of The Sound of Music is the perfect family film for a wide screen television set. From the outstanding panorama shot of the Alps at the beginning of the movie to the end, this blue ray transfer shines. This 3 disc present station includes a wealth of extras.<br /><br />Enjoy !
B00821OX98|5.0|This show was refreshingly creative and suspenseful. I thought  the acting was consistently good. I am not a big scifi fan, but I am a big fan of this show and await the new season.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|The holder works well, however the tripod I tossed because it falls apart when you try to use it. The tripods legs collapse and there is no way to lock the rotation of the tripod. So the phone just flops around.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|The twists and turns.  The intrigue and the characters all make this awesome 1st season.  All star cast.  What an opening scene with Claire Danes rolls into her bathroom and freshens up by wiping the sweat between her thighs with a wash cloth. . .seriously.  The realism and the potential for realism is there.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Enjoying this very app very much. Thank you! It's very convenient to have right at my fingertips. I truly appreciate how easy it is to use.
B002NUULNG|5.0|This version 2.0 has awesome graphics. . .so detailed.  One of the best anime's ever.  Great visualization of a future that could potentially exist.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Months before it was released, I found its production blog and had been excitedly following it. Aardman Animations is an incredible company. The work that was put into it was insane, but I still found myself dreaming of one day working for them. When the commercials came out, I was so excited! Then, I saw it in theaters the week it came out and it was even better than I was hoping! I had to travel many miles to see it, but I didn't care, and I got some friends to go with me and we dressed as pirates. The plot was not at all what one would come to expect from the commercials--it was even better. It had many hilarious moments (Brit humor is the best!!!!) and many heartwarming moments as well. It was done beautifully. The voice actors did a great job and of course the animation was unbelievable. When this movie finally came out on DVD I ordered it and gave it to my dad for Christmas. This is not a man who always appreciates children's movies, but even he adored this movie. It has something in it for everyone.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|great. math problems are a nice feature that prevent you from falling back asleep. I would definately recommend this app
B007V65R54|5.0|If you like Malcom Gladwell books , or the freakonomics books. This is a must read for you. Nate is a genius and the book is fairly easy to read for how complicated the subject can be. If you occupation is anywhere from wall street to a poker pro i would advise you to pick this book up.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Pretty good movie. It was full of suspense. Russell Crowe did a great job in is acting role. I would watch again.
B009B4ZEMA|4.0|Most people, including many of Xtina so-called fans, have trashed her album Bionic; calling it unfocused and too experimental. She has released her newest album Lotus to dissapointing sales/critics (this girl can't catch a break).<br /><br />I dare to say Lotus is one of her best albums yet, it has a modern sound with lots of pop, electronic sounds, dance, and power ballads. Her vocals are strong but not screeching as they tended to be on Back to Basics. In the majority of tracks she displays tons of attitude and sass (Circles, Army of Me), sexuality (Red Hot Kinda Love, Your Body, Let There Be Love, Around the World), and vulnerability (Cease Fire, Best of Me, Lotus Intro, Blank Page, Light Up the Sky [on deluxe version]).<br /><br />As is a bit clear, Christina tends to focus to much sounding \\"defensive\\" in Lotus, which is the only downsize to the record. Nonetheless, there are many gems in here that deserve to be heard... repeatedly!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you're into a good, &#34;dry&#34; comedy (like many of us are) this movie is for you.  The acting is fantastic, the storyline is original, and the laughs are constant.

B006MOW98E|5.0|Three nice little Christmas stories in one pretty little package.  I bought this because of John Green, but in the end I liked the stories by each of the authors pretty much equally.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I thought it to be fun and a little challenge. I enjoyed the mini games as well as the hidden object parts. Then I really like them when there is a story as well.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This app is really cool and addicting. People may say that the popups are dangerous, but you just have to pay attention to what you click on. I for one am a 14 year old and I have no problem with this app. Add me : aspenbloom
B007MG360G|5.0|This is the best game ever! I love how you can make soooo many animals! Like you have a polar bear and a Fox you combine them and you get a polar Fox!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I've had this app for a few days now, and so far so good. I  can choose the design I<br />want, despite what a previous reviewer said, and I've enjoyed playing an old favorite. I've even gotten my 7 yr old son and 4 1/2 yr old daughter to play with me -<br />we've had a lot of fun competing and taking turns. Totally worth the 99 cents.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|It's hard to know where to start on this one.  Reading the reviews I expected so much more.<br /><br />First, there were so many inconstancies that broke me from the story over and over.  First this is set in the Appellation Mountains.  LoL.  Do you really believe people from a capital could ever beat rugged men and women that live there? Much less let their children be sacrificed for 70 something years.  Wow!  Ok I know your going to say it was like the Civil war and the capital used technology to win.  If they had the that kind of technology then they would not depend on humans to mine for coal. They would have some other source of energy or machines to dig the coal. Then if they can genetically engineer animals, then there would be no hunger because they could just as easily engineer food. There are easier ways to subdue a populace than starvation and killing their kids. If anything thats a recipe for revolution, especially if the people are rugged Americans and it certainly would not take 70 years to start.<br /><br />As for the seen it part, Battle Royale. lol I think the author of Battle Royale should have sued for a piece of the pie.<br /><br />I think the primes of the book was what kept me from enjoying the rest.  Then to have such an emotionally odd lead did not help either. Overall, I read 90% of the book and stopped reading.  Maybe the other books in the series redeems the first but I'm not going to waist the time or money to find out.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|It works really nice. I can access my computer through my kindle and I am able to use it ( the computer) as I was sitting on my desk. However, the controls in alittle bit confusing in the begginings...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another amazing book. Such a tough subject matter, done so in very positive way. Will absolutely be recommending this one as well!
B0098XY5VK|5.0|If you like time managing games, you will love it! I played this game before on the computer, but the touch screen make it way better. I recomend it and I am wating for Hot Dog Bush 2 :)
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|The Deluxe Version is very good, great music especially if you like Kelly Clarkson. I would highly recommend this CD and the Vendor.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I don't know I they do that with the Kindle. My kindle HD is amazing, but I dont know why they charge for things that should be included, like this font pack and the camera for example. And the kindle doesn't come with a charger?<br /><br />In resume, the app works, I just dont like the fact that we need to pay for it.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|This was an excellent, movie, great combination of actors, especially with Micheal Caine, Noel Coward and Benny HIll.<br />Extremely funny done to the end.  If you have not seen the original Italian Job, you are missing a great classic.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I love this product. I usually use on commercials, when I can hear just a little piece of a song that interestes me :)<br />It is easy and fun :)
B00881VLCE|5.0|It gives me something to do in my spare time i love it so much it makes me want to scream
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game. It is addictive and fun. I have it on all my phones and kindle. That way I can play it any where and any time.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I like the way the scenes were done in this. I am not a huge 007 follower so I can't give a really accurate rating, but in my opinion it was pretty good not quite a perfect five though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Thus is an excellent kids game. They will spend hours and it is so realistic. I would recomend this to anyone who has children to purchase this free game.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|The way it started I thought it was going to be very predictable, but it ended up having a good twist. Still just another scary movie though nothing epic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is probably the best game i have ever played.  I mean, there are no restrictions, just an open world for you to build in.  If i could choose one app to have from the entire app store this would be the one i choose.  Thanks Mojang for the great game, and people don't forget to buy the computer version!  I mean you think this is good? Your Wrong!! Computer version has so much more you can do, but this is a great portable version.  This is also a great time passer, but i don't want to bore you people, so this is a great app THANKS SO MUCH MOJANG!!!!!!!
B008R14YBK|5.0|I never would have thought this was &#34;Teddy Duncan&#34;.  Quite a surprise that this voice is coming from her.  What talent!  You should buy this album.  It's not your typical children's favorite character from a disney show cd.  Very impressed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitare is fun and keeps you busy when your bored. You also don't need to find space for your card set up. I like this app.
B009GESJH2|5.0|As always, Kid Rock delivers another great album.<br />I would recommend this to all the Kid Rock fans out there as well as those who are on the fence about him.  This album show a great range for him.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Great acting by Colin Firth. Gives a lot of insight into some of what it means to be part of the royal family.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My 4 year old LOVES this cd.  And it's catchy.  There's songs I even find myself singing after listening to it with her.
B001NHNG64|1.0|If you read it back-to-back with Jack Reacher No. 1, you will see a very similar story line and very similar cast of sadistic characters.  It is a form of pornography; I'll never read another one of his books.  Too bad because the guy can tell a story.
0765325950|4.0|I enjoyed reading A Memory of Light.  I thought that Brandon Sanderson did a remarkable job of ending this series.  In my opinion he did a wonderful job of keeping the characters and the story line consistent with the earlier books written by Mr. Jordan.  Overall I thought that it was a very good ending to a great fantasy series, I think Mr. Jordan would have approved.
B00821OX98|5.0|My husband and I love sci-fi.  And we have been hooked by watching Season 1.  It is well-thought out and suspenseful - a perfect mix.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Purchased Season 3 for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I am new to Downton and wanted to catch up with the character's and story. Also watched for  free season's 1 & 2 with my Prime Video Account. The picture was so clear and wonderful. I do recommend if you need to view the one's you missed this is the way to go. Very reasonable.
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|This movie is just so-so. It covers the story of the manager of the Oakland A's baseball team and how he changed the way management hired and fired players.He adopts the use of statistics versus the old school methods of hunches and crowd appeal. This movie looks like a pet project of Brad Pitt. It never ignites.
1594487154|5.0|Add Daniel Pink to my short list of authors whose books I approach with a \\"just buy it\\" mentality.  As he did with Drive and A Whole New Mind, this latest work delivers a much needed update with clarity, humor, and the data to support his positions.<br />I'm excited about this new way of thinking about sales.  As Pink describes, in today's world we're all in the business of moving others, both personally and professionally.  This book is full of practical ideas for improving these moving skills and, in the process, our ability to have a positive impact at work, at home, and in our communities.
0425264351|5.0|Addictive and fast paced, Jack Reacher is a bada**. The movie, however, does look like garbage. Books good, movie bad.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, very entertaining. It has a quality sound and picture, would recommend for anyone that likes action pack entertainment.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Very Good Movie- not what I expected.  Loved all of the supporting roles especially Don Cheadle.  The movie seemed very real and relateable.
B006FE83U4|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites. I have truly enjoyed watching this with my family and friends. Love it and am glad I own it!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|couldn't be any happier! just as advertised and it doesn't lag!! I can't wait to buy the rest of the game and finish it!!
B003UESJ9W|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Quality picture and the sound was terrific. I have no doubt this is worth the price.
0425264351|3.0|\\"The Killing Floor\\" is Lee Child's first Jack Reacher novel, and it shares the attention to detail and meticulous research that has made the better Jack Reacher novels such compelling reads.  Unfortunately, Lee Child chooses to write the novel in first-person, and it's hard to identify with a 6 foot four killing machine, and I found myself skimming through this predictable and shallow novel.
B0068FYZCA|5.0|This is great to have in your collection of oldies but goodies. I have enjoyed watching it with my family.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing story about courage triumph love and family. Proves that no matter what love can concur all.. and there are more then two hearts involved in love
B001AQT0UY|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a family member. It is a nice movie and we have enjoyed watching it together.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This book tied together several of the previous books in the series.  I had a nostalgic moment when the story traces back to when Constance was introduced.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Our 4 year son loves this movie and it surprisingly has less violence than Cars 2, so I'm frequently putting it on for him. The CGI is incredible, acting is okay, and the plot definitely requires renting the original Tron (don't let the original set your expectations, just use it as an opportunity to be in awe of how far technology has progressed) to forego any unnecessary pauses to bring new viewers up to speed.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Very slow book. Ending worth the wait. Took a while to finish bc it kept dragging in the middle. Great ending. Not predictable
B00005OCMR|4.0|He's told me dozens of times how amazing the original Tron is so I bought this for him. He's right; I was amazed.... at how I hadn't realized how far technology has come in the past few decades! The plot is silly, the CGI is nonexistent, and the acting is smphhhh. [insert stifled chuckles] But it is an important segway into understanding the plot of the sequel and I was entertained. If my husband were writing this review, he'd give it 6 stars. I'd give it 3, so I averaged it between us. ;)
B00AR1G3FS|3.0|How can there be all these reviews for the Fare well tour when it has not been released on Blu-ray?<br />This concert will not be released on Blu-ray until 2/26/2013.<br />I would expect that it will both sound and look great, but there are no actual reviews for the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />Realdeal
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I have read many of her books and with everyone you cannot put it down.  You don't want the story to end.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Just wanted to give my 3dtv a boost with a decent collection and this movie is excellent. Story line is kinda basic at best but the visuals are totally awesome. I have the vizio 32&#34; 3d tv and the visuals don't really fly off the screen, but gives you a depth and floats a little off the screen but not like some LG ones I have seen that fly at you
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|That summaries the plot of the story - interesting, absorbing, realistic and unpredictable the twists and turns in the story.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Such a fun and classic tail of two good people who have a great deal of person integrity, who are both force by their personal honesty re-evaluate their prejudices and opinions.  Once start their intregity cause them to make significant adjustments to their behavior and opinions and see the good in the other that what they had previously found abhorrent became quickly their ambition and goal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a great read! Even after seeing the movie before I read the book it had me at the edge of my seat!! Can't wait for the next 2 :)
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I am amazed at the planning that must have gone into this series.  It is so intricately woven.  Can't wait to dive  into the next one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept you guessing all the way.  At the end, I'm still not sure who was the bad guy.  Maybe both.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and better than temple run I enjoy this game and I'm happy that it's free:)
B006P0FD4W|5.0|Glad I got a copy of this movie and I'm glad the product arrived intact and in a timely fashion.
B005HSL626|5.0|never played this game. it sounded silly so I never bothered. I recently saw a geico commercial with the pig playing it. I decided to check out the reviews and they were all great. ill let ya know!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is GREAT!!! It's worth the money and it's only $0.99 anyway! I really recommend this app. It's fun challenging and awesome time passer!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|All books were incredible and I'm sad I have no more to read... at least I have the last 2 movies to watch.
B005HSL626|5.0|Love this game! Before I got my kindle fire I loved playing it on other people's tablets...I didn't this it would be free but, it was! I highly recommend this game it's a great time passer!
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I loved this whole series! Ended Wonderfully! I would definately purchase this all over again! Sad its over I have to say!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story was heart warming. I usually read intrigue books and this was a breath of fresh air and I will read more of his books. I have already started another.
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|I really enjoyed Lost. I wished I had enjoyed it for 6 years instead of 2 months by watching through Amazon Instatnt Video, but I am glad I watched it. Enjoy!
159514188X|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is the best book I've ever read. Being a teen there is so much you can relate to.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|It´s always hard to review a movie, since everyone´s taste is different.<br /><br />I got this streaming version when I bought the physical blu-ray and decided to give it a go.<br /><br />The streaming experience was very good. High-quality picture and sound, easily accessible and fast &#34;download&#34;-time (no buffering, but again, this might change depending on your internet speeds).<br /><br />So the product itself is good, I can´t complain about that.<br /><br />The movie on the other hand was quite meh. You might be wondering what &#34;meh&#34; means, but it´s just that. It´s not no, it´s not yes, it´s like in between, it´s alright.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first movie in this series and did have some expectations to this, however they weren´t met. I feel it´s the same movie in a lot of aspects, and therefore I got the feeling that I´d seen it before. Robert Downey Jr is a good actor, but I´m getting a bit tired of him to be honest. He´s the same character in all his movies; the cocky, knowitall, charming, &#34;sarcasticly&#34; witty guy.<br /><br />I wouldn´t really recommend it, but I´m not gonna say &#34;don´t watch it&#34; either. It´s all up to you obviously. It´s entertainment, but not a good movie.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I really enjoy these actors, and the story, though a little weak, hits home for those of us who are getting older.  I get the feeling that the subject matter was just a little too meaty to deal with in film. I was expecting a silly comedy, but the funny parts were laced with pathos, so it was bittersweet rather than &#34;lots of laughs.&#34; Streep was really brilliant, as was Steve Carrell, who played the marriage counselor. I've decided that the movie was worth watching, but I won't watch it again to catch easy-to-miss moments. The value of the movie is what it evokes in the viewer, which is a personal review of one's own life. I'm not sure that younger viewers will really get it; as a matter of fact, I hope they never do.
B007SGM084|1.0|todas mis amigas me lo aconsejaron y lo compre, no he sido capaz de terminarlo, es absolutamente aburrido y monotono.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|You won't be surprised to find that a central story in this book is a headline story in today's paper.  How does he do it?
B0067TGSOK|2.0|If all you want is cheap, short-lived inspiration, look no further. If you're interested in specificity, guidance, or practical detail that will help you create a successful business, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Because the book description made claims such as \\"not content to talk in generalities, Chris tells you exactly how...\\", I expected this to be a guide. Instead, it's a collection of surface-level, feel-good anecdotes about people who started successful businesses with little cash. Chris Guillebeau, as it turns out, is highly content to talk in generalities.<br /><br />For a more in-depth look at a repeatable framework with which to build a business while minimizing risk, I recommend Eric Ries' excellent The Lean Startup. For more concrete details of how to test and start a business on a shoestring budget, I highly recommend The Four Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss. For more in-depth examples of businesses built with little resources, I recommend its accompanying blog, fourhourblog.com. All three of these offer both inspiration and actionable guidance, while The $100 Startup can provide only the former.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|All the more fascinating because it is true.  This is the story of the training that it takes to become someone special and the call to heroism that each man of Seal Team 10 responded to.
B005LAII3U|5.0|action packed gets you from the beginning of the movie and keeps your attention.is much better than the orginal movie
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is one of my favorites out of all the ones I have read. There is so much detail in it and it shows the life of a little girl during the holocaust period. I have read this book twice already in the past two years.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Hello. I do not normally read contemporary material, I'm more of a classics girl, but this book was soooooo exciting I am now going to read her other books. What a talent......
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A very awesome app!!! If your parents wont let you have a horse in real life, get this app!! It is soooo cool!!
B00004STPT|5.0|I've listened to this sound track many times and it still inspires me. a great piece of work. a great movie!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Each chapter added just enough information about the mystery to keep me guessing and wanting to read more.  The characters were well described and interesting.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|If I wasn't Vegan before reading this book, I would be after. Sad truth about the way farm industry treats animal.
B007REV4YI|5.0|As usual some people brought the total star rating down by giving bad reviews because of technical issues,like a DVD that didn't work. So dumb. These reviews are supposed to be about whether or not you liked the movie.<br /><br /> Director Sam Mendes gets a lot credit here. First of all, the cast is perhaps the best ever in a Bond film. Some of the films have been hurt by poor performances by models who couldn't act, such as Denise Richards. None of that nonsense here, great casting. Javier Bardem was particularly good as the villain. This film doesn't have action every second, which is another plus because it makes it feel real instead of cartoon-ish. If you like the tongue-in-cheek things from the older films you may be disappointed, but all of the Daniel Craig versions have been more realistic. The photography in this film is magnificent, just a brilliant production with beautifully shot scenes. Anyone who appreciates cinematography will love watching this. Cinematographer Roger Deakins is one of the greats. Definitely one of the best Bond films ever and I'm sure many will say the best ever, a remarkable achievement considering how long this film franchise has been around. The Blu Ray has stunning sound and the picture is first rate. The extras aren't anything special. A bonus for Adele fans is getting to hear her Skyfall song in DTS-HD 5.1 surround sound.
B004QOB8SO|4.0|My wife and I are great fans of the Sherlock Holmes genre.  It is nice to see a modern interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved this movie a lot, i related to it & thought it was really well done. the movie was original and i would watch it a hundred times over!
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|These are asas expected whenwhen viewing the pic. Our daughter has fun with them on her hands or feet. The  rattles inside are more like bells. They still distract and entertain her at 10 months.
B005HED11Y|4.0|An original that I still enjoy. Gene Roddenberry put together a cast that clicks and the characters mesh well. &#34; Star Trek, the Next Generation&#34; is likewise entertaining for the same reasons. However &#34;Star Trek Voyager&#34; destroys the feeling of a &#34;tight knit&#34; group because the characters have evolved into a stress based, ego wielding self serving crew.<br /><br />I don't mind reviewing the shows I have watched, but I don't like the fact that I have to sign in to do it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching the film, I had expected the book to be quite similar. I was pleasantly surprised to find a more elaborate story.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Delightful characters and setting, very family friendly viewing, very entertaining. I wish they'd made a few more seasons of this series.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|Best ever.  My kids are at the perfect age for this--5 and 7.  Classic family movie.  Do you really need to read my review?
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Definitely interesting to see how I should have paid more attention to physics and geometry classes while in high school.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story is a challenge to follow at first and at times feels like the author doesn't know where the story is headed. I really enjoyed the story but the thoughts and story is disjointed. Worth reading for sure.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Gave coin dozed 5 stars. I love going back to this game everyday. Definitely addicting! I could play for hours. There needs to be more coin levels tho. But great game!
B00005JJX8|5.0|Great scenery in the movie. Very good blend of suspense and light comedy. Grace Kelly is probably one of the best looking women ever.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I just love this series.  I will end up buying every season and probably do a marathon at some point. Well done Series
B004I2K4DY|2.0|Was not as good as the 10th Anniversary concert. Did not like the performers. Was not worth watching more than 10 minutes.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I loved the descriptions of life under Stalin. It really reminds me how fortunate I am to be an American.<br />The story is riveting, and I can't wait to read the next 2 books. I bought them today.
B005K2KCPG|5.0|For a &#34;part time&#34; band, these guys really rock.  Really works without stepping all over each other.  Each album seems to get better, the more they perform together.  Rock on dudes!!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I had already read this book four years ago after Barack Obama was elected president and he mentioned it as an inspiration for his presidential aspirations. Then before the Lincoln movie was released I decided to read it again to refamiliarize myself with the details. I can honestly say that I enjoyed it as much or more than I did the first time through. Doris Kearns Goodwin and her editor do a masterful job of storytelling. This book is insightful, intelligently organized, and completely enjoyable to read. I highly recommend it, especially if this is your first book on Lincoln.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I use it with my powerex 2700 batteries. It works flawlessly with my D7000. the photos come out with such a big difference than using the built in flash
B0060D15AK|5.0|I am so sorry, I nver watched the video on line a few days back, when it got ordered.  I did not mean to order it to watch.  I was trying to buy it on DVD, to have and keep.  I have seen  it in the past on tv.  I ordered the DVD today.  I have no time to just sit and watch a whole movie at one time, so I prefer the DVD to watch.  I do not have time to sit and do these reviews much either.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This movie is such a good, good wholesome movie. Teaching friendship and THE BEST ending ever. I watch it quite alot.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|PBS doesn't get any better than this. Can't wait for season 3. Come on Amazon,  hurry and run this on your streaming video.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|My wife loves it!  My wife had this listed on her Christmas Wish List and since receiving it, has listened to it many times!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a great series! I look forward to reading many more books of hers in the future! I could hardly put any of them down!
B00ANW33CM|2.0|It's mahjong, in 3d, which would be cool, but the controls are painfully bad and generally unusable. I've already uninstalled this. Not worth the price I paid ($0).
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I can not get tired of watching this movie. It's the story of leaving a sheltered & protected life because of a family curse that gave Penelope a pig nose, then wanting to leave it all behind for something more fulfilling.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Could not put this book down. Begging is hard to get through but once you get into a few chapters you are hooked. good book.
B0089XH38M|5.0|So far this AntiVirus by AVG seems to be working just fine. I see it scaning the new apps I down load.
B00BEDFCRI|5.0|I love this show. It keeps you wanting to watch more and more. I like the way they go from our world to fairy tale world. When they do that, it explains a lot about what is going on in both worlds. I'm almost done with season 1and can't wait to catch up on season 2. Keep up the good work. There is no other show like this.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|after downloading this app I never forget to charge my kindle..its so handy and easy to access. and the ability to change the colors to &quot;suit&quot; your mood is awesome
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|Never could get it installed. It downloaded and then just hung during the install process, so I never could even try it.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|JUST A SPELLBINDING SERIES SAW THE LAST COUPLE OF EPSODES ON TV AND WHEN I SAW THAT IT WAS ON<br /><br />THE FIRE I HAD TO WATCH FROM THE START OF THE SERIES JUST A GEM.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|We cannot review this item since we have not received it as yet.  I have paid for it but have not received it.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Plenty of practical tips mixed with fun stories.  Useful if you are considering taking the leap to run your own company, even just part time.
B008476HBM|5.0|Such a beautiful and well told love story! I fell in love with Mr Darcy while becoming envious of Elizabeth's charismatic character at the same time.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it is not a good game because it will not let me play the game. but I really wish that it would let me:(
B009329ZF2|2.0|If you like completely over the top action packed unrealistic movies, this one's for you!  I was not impressed at all.
0451232852|5.0|The so called protective cover does not protect the I phone 5<br />The shields were extremely hard to put on.  Directions not clear<br />Replacements are in order
B000007MVD|4.0|It was in good condition, except for one thing. It had a little scratch on it, not the CD, but the cover thingy. And I think I am missing a small book thingy, not even sure.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased these to replace my aging Plantronics Gamecon 666(?). They lasted a good five years and were falling apart, was time to move on.<br /><br />With my daughter learning to walk, I figured it was time to try out a wireless head set. Reading some of the reviews I wanted to give the 930 a shot but the price was killing me. I waited until a sale came up for 80$ round about.<br /><br />Glad I did. This set has been wonderful. The sound quality is outstanding. I use it mostly for gaming, and it has brought great depth to some of the titles. The 7.1 sounds good as far as I'm concerned. The charge has never failed during a gaming session. I knowing ave gone a solid 6 hours without a problem. Even if there was one with the charge, the 939 can be plugged in via an unobtrusive USB connection and charge while in use. The cable is one enough to not be any kind of hindrance. The 930s range is really neat. I can go easily 30' away in another room and still have good sound quality. I've gone as far as across the house and upstairs and still been able to hear what was gong on with minimal interference. The 930 is easily as comfortable as my old Plantronics, which was great. I have never had an comfort issues after hours of use.<br /><br />The only down side is occasional inference from my cell phone. This only happens if the phone is downloading something and sits infront of me or between me and the receiver for the 930. If I place the phone an arms length away, no issues. Oh yeah, the normal price is a bit high to. I think if it hovered closer to 100$ more often it would be spot on.<br /><br />So far the 930 has been great. I recommend this to anyone in the market that can afford it.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I showed this game to a friend and she wouldn't let me have it back. It was great. We are trying to put it onto her Kendle.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a wonderful story that draws you in and keeps you so involved that if you are unable to complete this book in a weekend , it would be surprising.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This was the first game I put on the machine. I enjoyed playing and it took me a while to get through it. I went to another game like it but haven't like it at all.
0307593312|5.0|From my own perspective as a writer, and this is a very fundamental and troubling concept for me, is there even a possibility of narrative or story in the hyperreal dystopia we live in?<br />What was the completed story cycle( beginning,middle,end) in Infinite Jest, The Recognitions, Gravity's Rainbow, Ada, or Ardor? Were they writing, and were you reading, about nothing, something, anything? What were the exact, specific contents of the film Infinite Jest? What was the real payload of the V-2 in Gravity's Rainbow? Where Van and Ada really brother and sister?<br />I find 1Q84 enchanting, dreamlike, immersive, illusive, fantasy-not-scifi, and amusingly filled with Western-style cultural iconography( a la Ian Fleming). Two wonderful insights made by the author- you cannot know love unless you experience it by giving and receiving to and from another, and the world needs a Foucauldian balance between power and resistance.<br />My daughter suggested I read it, and I'm glad I did! I even sent her a gift hardcover edition.<br />Will Murakami usurp Nabokov as my fave? Jury still out, tune in next time for the exciting conclusion...<br />One thing that puzzles me is how the figures of speech and idioms that I read in English from this book were translated over from Japanese. I think Nabokov thought in Russian, but wrote in English. And I don't get the same feeling from any translation of Proust, whether it's the old or newer translations from French. Just sayin, ya know?
B0058VW36U|3.0|My grandson has really enjoyed showing me while we play this game. It has been enjoyible to be able to do this game together.
B00846TTDG|4.0|I rated this movie 4 out of 5 , but if i could it would've  been closer to 5.  Great story line, lots of good action scenes.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Captivating read loved the problem solving.After so many triumphs one would have to believe in the intervention of God .
B005NJU8PA|2.0|The book was entertaining, as I imagine an evening with Mr. Ferriss must be, but it improved cooking skills I will hardly ever use. Cauliflower cream bulle. If your cooking that at home you're bored beyond repair. Guess he should listen to his final advice: simplify.
B00APJLFEG|1.0|It didn't even work. :( wah it was the worst 3.99$ I have ever spent.<br />it is the biggest fail in the entire world. i hate you amazon, i hate your kids<br />and your grandkids bye.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The case doesn't fit ...can't use it and its junk ...screen has bubble in it and waste of money don't buy
B006H07PG4|5.0|I am reviewing the Kindle edition of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, created from the World's Classics edition published by Oxford University Press.  Although there are editions of this work and collected editions of all of Austen's novels available for low prices or even for free, I highly recommend spending the few dollars to get this World's Classics edition, which was $4.28 when I purchased it.  First of all, you get a carefully edited and accurate text, prepared by Oxford University Press, which has been publishing Jane Austen for longer than most publishers have been in existence.  Within the text, there are footnotes, easily clickable on any touch-screen Kindle, giving background information on elements possibly unfamiliar to the modern reader, such as conveyances; it does add to the book's value to know the difference between a barouche and a curricle, for example.  There are notes on occupations, landscaping, theater, and many other elements.  There is a substantial introduction, exploring the creation of this novel and interpreting some of its themes.  You also get an appendix of essays on rank and social status, dancing, and \\"Austen and the navy\\".  In sum, if you are interested in this work, pay a few dollars and get a well-prepared edition.<br />As for the work itself, I very much like all six of Jane Austen's novels, but I think Mansfield Park is especially fine.  She has a firm grasp of her characters and the way they interact with one another, as well as a marvelous and detailed picture of all of the different locales where things take place.  There are scene after scene, and even line after line, which are as memorable as the wonderful parts of the better-known novels (Pride and Prejudice, Emma, and Sense and Sensibility).  All of her novels are wonderful, but I feel this is a work of her maturity, by which I mean at the peak of her powers.  (I also consider Northanger Abbey to be among the best of the best.)
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|its fun and really creative I think its a way for people to use good handled eye cordiation!  I love it
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Visually and mentally stimulating and challenging.<br />I loved it instantly, I have a funny feeling you will too ... be ready for the cube attack mode, it gets intense.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I am huge Bond nut myself so glad to see the franchise continuing on with good direction. Danial Craig does a great job in the role. I found the movie exciting with action we have all come to expect from Bond films and suspense as well as twists. They did take it back a little old school towards the end with nodes to previous Bonds. I watched it twice myself. If your a Bond fan you will not be disappointed. At least I wasn't....
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This second part of the trilogy was so much better than the first.  The events were not at all predictable...I love the twists and turns. I can't wait to read the last one.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|I love it, lots of small parts but not to difficult to assemble. However this was a gift for an adult and not a child, and he loves it :)
B008HTQ28K|4.0|Suspense and twists all the way.Grisham knows how to make the nreader keep turning the pages. You don't know whats comming next. unputdownable.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|great game but need to remove apps memory is full on my kindle wish it jhad more memory or a sd slot
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I bought this album for my wife and she absolutely loves it!  She's been a fan since American Idol and has seen her live quite a few times.  I actually saw her live as well at the Orpheum Theater in Boston with my wife m freshman year of college.  i must say, I'm not usually a fan of this type of music, but Kelly has an amazing voice and now I listen to her stuff whenever it on the radio or my wife has it on in the car.

0765325950|5.0|Although I am certain that most WOT fans would have become enraged, I was hoping that the final word used in \\"A MEMORY OF LIGHT' would be \\"flicker\\".
B00005V0X5|1.0|when I ordered this cd i was expecting to hear the music the way it was orginally recorded. Instead on the last track almost all the words are bleeped out because of the language. No where on the page I ordered it on does it say that the music is censored, it says on the package explecit language but it is a lie. I am very unhappy with this purchase and it is very wrong of you not to inform people that what they are buying is not the original music. It will be the last time I buy anything from amazon again.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm excited to watch it over and over.  Can't wait to see the unedited scenes (usually about 15 mins per episode left out in the USA shows.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The graphics and colors are great!!  Playing in HD is awesome!  It is like holding it in your hand like the rubics cube.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|As an admirer of Alice Munro, I savored these stories. She takes an unflinching look at relationships, character traits, with poetic intense clarity. Her unique voice is an inspiration to those of us who love serious literature, and enjoy a profound look at what it is to be human.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I am a bit surprised by all of the negative reviews surrounding this novel. Yes, the characters are often unsavory, immoral, self-centered buffoons, but does that make a book any less good? The characters, despite their less redeeming qualities, are well-crafted, believable and sometimes sympathetic. This novel isn't all hearts and flowers--it reveals some of the really ugly aspects of human nature and it will stay with me for a long time. I absolutely loved it and will read it again later on down the road.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This wonderfully written book contains one of the most detailed and extraordinary accounts of a near-death experience. It is extremely persuasive of the existence of an afterlife, and contains in depth accounts of the entire event, reading in a very accessible and heart-warming way. Adding even more credibility to this memoir is the fact that the writer is a neurosurgeon.
1433502410|5.0|Full of excellent commentary. Great introductions to books with background to help reader understand the context of the book. This is not a good Bible for devos. Pick up the Life in the Spirit Study Bible for that.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am a great fan of Harry Bosch!  I have read all ofMichael Connelly books featuring Harry Bosch, and am looking forward to the next installment.  I have read some of his others, but Harry is the best.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a  ex because of my love of The Smiths, so I dove right in. ReAlly enjoyed the characters
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but it was definetly my least favorite. Way to much sitting around in Mereen, and I didn't really care about any of the new characters. Also, Tyrion's arc is starting to seem a bit ridiculous. I'm really hoping he turns it all around in the next one.
B00881VLCE|2.0|the pictures shown are not the actual puzzles used to play with.  the puzzles were mostly cats, kids, no scenery pictures as shown.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I tried watching the show before I read the books and I fell asleep in the first five minutes. I found the book to be much more intriguing. As you've probably heard it's a good mix of human drama but also fantasy and other things. I am going to read the rest of the series but am taking a break first, as I think it will help me enjoy the rest of them more.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Although Baum's writing style improved as he wrote the subsequent Oz books, the original Wizard of Oz is by far his best, as far as stories go.  It is also the most frightening.  In hks later books, Baum portrays Oz as a wonderful land where everyone lives in peace and no one can ever die.  In this first book, however, death lurks around every corner.<br /><br />You will find few happy and contented folks in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.  Half the population lives under the tyrannical rule of wicked witches while the citizens of the land's capital, the Emerald City, are suppressed on a daily basis, forced to wear glasses that alter their perception of reality, making them believe that everything looks better than it really is.  While we all want to be happy and content, hungry and driven makes for a much more dramatic story.<br /><br />As does danger.  In the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and her new friends face danger and death at every turn, and the body count is quite extensive.  Two witches, a pair of monstrous kalidahs, one wildcat, forty wolves, forty vicious crows, a swarm of bees and a giant spider.  For the heroes it is often kill or be killed, and most of the deaths are quite gruesome.  Flattened by a house.  Heads decapitated.  Necks wrung one at a time.  We fear for our heroes and are relieved when they ultimately triumph.<br /><br />As good as all of Baum's Oz books are, this one will always remain his best.<br /><br />Mike LaMontagne, author, The Wizard of Oz: Dark Witch Rising trilogy [[ASIN:B006P8DVCA Rainbow's Emissary (The Wizard of Oz: Dark Witch Rising)]][[ASIN:B008QNCC9K Witch Hunt (The Wizard of Oz: Dark Witch Rising)]]
B001NLKT60|5.0|I read the first book of this series about a year ago, and liked it but thought it had gotten overhyped. So when I picked this one up I was expecting to be entertained but not much beyond that. With the right expectations, I thought this book was awesome. I have always really liked the characters and the way they interact. I like the way he clues you in to information as the characters are finding it out, so you are in the plot with them. I am anxious to read the next one!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|4 stars because it was fast and had enough twists and turns to keep it going. KIND of like the tv show Touch!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Go my parents hooked on kindle and reading some of my favorite books.  The best invention ever.  No more bulky books just my app!
B001JU4S44|1.0|One of the most over-the-top, not to mention completely unrealistic action movies I have ever seen. Meh. At least the leading lady is gorgeous.
B0063IH60K|5.0|When sitting and trying to listen to something this is fun to play.  Especially if it is a training or lecture!
1451695195|5.0|Well written and hard to put down. Unique personal writing style. Very convincing story of spirit and conciouceness outside and distinct from our physical bodies in this world. Takes a rational look at the complexity of multiple universe's and how our human experience is a brain filtered process of something marge larger where time and space are not the same as in our world on earth.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My favorite place to go when I want to learn how to do something.  Someone was brilliant when they made this app!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that I can both read the Word in a wide variety of versions and can also listen to it in several of them. Easy to use.
B004U52VPS|1.0|This game really sucks.  The plastic &#34;wood&#34; pieces are so cheaply made that they are really hard to stack on each other--uneven seams, really light and rigid plastic.  The only fun my kids have had with this is slinging the birds with the catapult, but I could have made my own for a lot less money.  Really disappointed!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is an awesome game to play, I love the animal graphics and the way the cubs and xp falls
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A good read for Stephen King and \\"what if\\" fans.  A little long in places,but worth the time.  Yes, do read it.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This movie was fantastic. The villans were dark & twisted, Batman was strong but vulnerable which I loved since he's just a guy with great gadgets. The story pulled from the comic base with some really interesting changes. I love Fox, Commissioner Gordon, and Blake, but my favorite addition was Serena Kyle (aka Catwoman). This is by far the best depiction of her character. She has sass without being cheesy and she's clearly an anti-hero more than a villan which is super compelling. Great movie and definitely makes me want another go round.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|To make this short, I appreciate any book that can relate to not only my own, but every ones life as well. I don't have any fancy words to describe just how much I enjoyed this book, but I assure anyone reading this that I did, more so than even tfios which is a favorite with most teenage girls. I love John green is basically what I'm trying to say.
0307341577|1.0|Interesting POV switch throughout until ending which I thought horrible. Author's choice of plot and character twist not believable. Do not recommend.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I love this calendar. I have tried others but always come back to this. It's easy, can link to other calendars like Gmail, etc. You can customize. It just works great for me.
B007PS0DTI|5.0|Really enjoyed this next chapter in the Underworld series...an awesome addition to the series! Hope to see the next one soon;0)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We enjoy the drama and character development in Downton Abbey. There are always multiple story lines going with interesting characters, mixed with the historical details of the day. Excellent!
B008AT9XOC|5.0|5 stars because it got here fast. Just in time for valentine day. glad i was finally able to find this movie.
B001P3SA94|5.0|It was very entertaining and had historical value. I watched the movie 5 times and each time I saw something that I missed.I have suggested this movie to my friends.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I had never heard of Florence and the Machine, until \\"Ceremonials\\" was listed on my nieces' wedding gift wish list. Being a lovingly curious aunt, I listened to it here and purchased it ASAP., (I sent her money instead). I love the tonal quality of her voice, the emotional power of the music...I even dance to the music in my kitchen ..much to the dismay of my 3 little dogs.<br />I am from the music culture of the 1960's and this fit right in with my collection...now if she would just sing faster for another CD!!<br />For those of you in my age range..and enjoyed the music of the group \\"Renaissance\\", I do believe that you will enjoy \\"Ceremonials\\"<br />Sing on, Florence
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. Howard Shore is astounding, as usual. If you haven't seen the movie, do so. I bought the soundtrack and listened to it for a week straight before the movie came out, and it was well worth it.<br />As usual, no problems with Cloud Player.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|As usual Josh's voice is outstanding, but the songs are not comparable, or anywhere up to quality of albums such as Illuminations. In other words, I am spoiled by the earlier albums. Illuminations for example has got to be about the best of the very large library of popular and classical or pop that I own. This the combination of voice and song perfection.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Finally a calculator that is basic and simple.  The numbers are large and it works great!!  This will be an asset when unable to find one at work.
0596009208|5.0|Head first does a great job of setting up the foundations of Java and building off of those through out the book.<br />The writing style makes is very easy to follow along and stay interested.<br />Highly recommend working through all of the exercises (both programming and pencil and paper) because it helps round out the knowledge that is presented in the book.<br /><br />Must read for those who are getting into Java.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|This album has showcased the bands confidence and experience! Love Lzzy and the boys! Grammy winners for a reason :)
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved this movie! If you love music you will too! Great singing, acting and story lines. Filled with laughter,love and life lessons. All presented in a believable format that could have easily turned hokey!
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Addictive game and fun as well. Challenging enough where you don't get bored. I highly recommend this app. Just dont' play it if you have stuff to do. lol
B0063M22QO|5.0|The game gives you a challenge from the start, I love Mahjong and this is one of the better ones I have played.
B0030F5W5K|1.0|It's unfortunate when a good story line has to involve so much swearing. Not anything I can sit down with even teenagers to watch.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Great rebuild, easier to understand, better anime style, clearer picture, and all around a better version of Evangelion. Will purchase the others as they become avaliable for purchase. English lang. and better character roles make this a MUST HAVE for the Evangelion Fans.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Would recommend this app for children who love horses. It is really entertaining and engaging and I think quite a nice app. My only frustration is with the interruption of ads constantly.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|..  Fun game to play.  Very easy to set up and .get started.  I would recommend this game.. this is a great time killer.
B00354YA2M|5.0|This is a tongue in cheek history lesson.Well written and researched it is a merry romp across Australia in awhirlwind fashion as Bryson hops around the country.I liked it so much from my book club read i Bought it for my Kindle for DH to read. he liked as much as I did
B0015AARJI|5.0|The controls came in quick and in great shape they both worked fine.  Definitely going to buy all my accessories online from now on.
B0068THAGY|5.0|This is a very cool movie.  I really enjoyed the plot and characters.  The train wreck is a beast!.  Probably the worst train wreak I've seen in a move. Special effect top notch!  Monster very well done.
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|Reading the Orphan Master's Son was like a journey through Hell; the reader is in turns horrified, stunned and completely disarmed by the lives of terror graphically presented by Adam Johnson's protagonists, Jun Do, and those his life touches. Yes, its a fiction novel but with unarguable roots in fact which Johnson carefully researched during his own Odyssey traveling in North Korea. This it what makes the Orphan Master's Son all the more compelling, believable and what rivets one's attention, even when it is painful to keep reading.<br />  North Korea is as unfathomable to westerners as another planet.  Far worse than an alien world, it is s place where personal identity is nullified and turned into a tool of the state.  No one owns their name, history or destiny.  Central character Jun Do ( John Doe? or Nemo?)is labelled an orphan, even though he knows his parents and has lived with his father. His life is continually modified by the demands of the State and his ability to survive is strictly linked to his ability to adapt.  But we learn that every North Korean citizen must live in this half-world of lies. No has personal space and no one dares speak out - unless it is in constant praise of the Dear Leader.<br />  We can hardly imagine the suffering the central characters endure. Each one is molded by the will of the Dear Leader's regime, even their names must reflect what Dear Leader wishes, and if a citizen transgresses he/she is removed & replaced, the vacant personality reinstated by another convenient citizen, as Jun Do experiences when he assumes the identity of Commander Ga. Yet ultimately there is salvation & deliverance ( of a sort) at the end of Jun Do's journey.  Not for the average North Korean,but for a few characters we have watched survive in this most unspeakable of terrorist regimes. Be prepared to feel pain but gain by the experience.<br />  Highly recommended.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|edgy, odd and a little askew, just like i like and a bit like me. i gave i 4/5 stars because it's only the 1st season and always room for improvement.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|This LCD is small and nothing special... the touch controls are a little finicky. But, it helps you frame your shots live with your GoPro, and for that, it's worth it.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|i just could not get in to this movie.  maybe i was my mood or some thing.  i've seen all the others n liked them.  the original still is my favorite.<br /><br />'
1476715904|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I felt this book deserved recognition. I've never read Colleen Hoover's books before but was ask to read this in a club. I loved it. I loved the characters, the little touch of laughter but most of all the emotion. I am not about poetry but this book makes me want to explore it. There is only a touch of it, but what's in it is powerful. Great book!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|just my cup of tea action action action, Tom and JEREMY RENNER.  always have loved IMF and this is best
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is an amazing book that tells the story of a boy who loses his best friend to suicide, and gains some new and different best friends. Truly an amazing and heart-warming story about a boy who becomes a secret keeper, and best friend to outcasts in high school
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|liked the original better. it did have great visual effects but granted some effects werent available when Arnold did the first one
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|This might be the best lego set I own. The touches like the logos and shape of the launch pad are fantastic. Its a big set and really satisfying to build with very little repetition.
B000IZA9PI|5.0|This is the best of the movies.  Great acting.  Great plot and story telling.  Spoiler alert.  It showed how close the main characters get.  and i was surprised how much Deanna troy knew about the bridge and the actually &#34;running&#34; of the ship.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|An easy read. A sad book with a slightly strange setting. Might have enjoyed it more as an early teen.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was such an insiteful book. I would have understood WWII much better if I had read this book earlier in life. I'm looking forward to the third book. It's so much easier when characters are involved. I wish that this book had been available sooner and closer to the previous book so that I could've remembered the characters from the book before this one.<br />Historians will love this book.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Fun packs in solid tracks in this album. I normally don't listen to FUN but I'm hooked on this album.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was absolutely magnificent. I absolutely enjoyed it though to be fair I would never really read this book on my own if it wasn't resorted by it school. I'm very glad I chose this book out of the rest.
B00499NHLC|4.0|As a disclaimer, I have so far only seen 2 out of the 3 episodes in session 1.<br /><br />Its is definitely a European thing to have short seasons (3-4 episodes) as this show does, but each one is 1 1/2 long so you don't feel cheated.<br /><br />However, while the characters are well developed and enjoyable and Sherlock's deductions plausible, the show suffers from mysterious murders that seem to have been written for a 1 hour show and drawn out to fill that extra 1/2 hour. This leads to definite slow spots and a feeling towards the end that the murder should have already been solved by all accounts.<br /><br />I do have high hopes for episode 3 and season 2 though so I will continue to watch.
B000NQ19QA|5.0|This is one of Dame Christie's better mystery novels  that will keep the reader spell bound and wanting for more.  The twists and turns of the novel will suprise and shock you.  I would recommend it to all readers who is interested in an old fashioned who done it.
0375413405|5.0|I have cooked three recipes with my girlfriend out of this book and we love it. Each recipe has given us really rich flavors to be remembered. This is a classic cooking textbook!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This season was very good I watched all the seasons. Love the actors  and  actresses. The show keeps you wanting more.
B008220DIC|5.0|This review does contain spoilers.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of this Blu-ray for review.  The Master is a post-WWII drama starring Philip Seymour Hoffman (Lancaster Dodd \\"The Master\\"), Joaquin Phoenix (Freddie Quell), and Amy Adams (Peggy Dodd).  The movie starts where WWII ends basically and shows some war veterans being treated for PTSD as they are talking to doctors and trying to adjust to life after the war.  The movie suggests that life would be hard in the world after witnessing the horrors the war had to offer.<br /><br />Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is an alcoholic and likes to mix things together that is readily available to him to make his own alcoholic drinks.  At one point we see him mixing drinks with paint thinner.  Anyway, after the war, Freddie starts out as a photographer in a department store taking pictures of families and individuals.  He eventually gets into a fight with some guy and runs away.  After being a photographer for a while, he ends up in a cabbage field harvesting cabbage.  He gets run off by the people in the cabbage field because they accuse him of poisoning someone with one of his mixed alcoholic drinks.<br /><br />Eventually, Freddie ends up on a ship, although he doesn't really know how he got there, this is where he meets Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), or \\"The Master.\\"  Lancaster tells Freddie that he stumbled drunk onto the ship and that's why he doesn't really remember how he got there.  He also tells Freddie that he looks familiar or has some sort of familiarity about him.  Lancaster seems to be some sort of hypnotist on the ship as the movie shows him going through a session with a woman.  The woman, under hypnosis, seems to recall details about her past.<br /><br />Freddie and Lancaster sit together to talk a bit, but Lancaster has other plans.  Lancaster starts recording the conversation that he is having with Freddie and he starts to ask him numerous questions, in which we find out alot about Freddie's background in this part of the film.  Lancaster calls this process of asking questions \\"processing\\".  During \\"processing\\", Freddie recalls his 16 year old girlfriend, Doris.  At this time, Freddie seemed to be hypnotized by Lancaster.<br /><br />After a while, the ship arrives in New York.  Lancaster is performing a session in front of a crowd of people where the woman he has hypnotized thinks she is a man for a brief moment.  A skeptic calls Lancaster out on his sessions and we find out a bit more about what is going on.  Lancaster says that people's spirits live on when they die and later they may take on a different form called a \\"spirit vessel\\".  We find out that Lancaster is performing some sort of past life hypnotization, which he calls it \\"dehypnotization\\" or an awakening.  The skeptic calls it \\"time travel hypnosis,\\" which he doesn't believe in.  After arguing a bit, things calm down.  Later that night, Freddie goes to the skeptic and beats him up for questioning \\"The Master.\\"<br /><br />Lancaster has a warrant out for his arrest for operating a medical school without a license.  At this time, Freddie gets arrested as well for interfering with the police officers.  Lancaster gets out of jail before Freddie and this is where we find out about \\"The Cause.\\"  At dinner later that night, Lancaster's family discuss \\"The Cause\\" and express concerns that Freddie is not totally committed.  Lancaster's son-in-law even goes as far as to say that Freddie is a spy or imposter.  Lancaster thanks them for their honesty and concerns.<br /><br />When Freddie gets out of jail, they all go to Phoenix, Arizona to release \\"The Master's\\" second book called, \\"Split Sabre.\\"  Freddie talks to Lancaster's publisher about the book and the publisher voices his opinions that the book isn't very good at all.  Freddie takes him outside and attacks him.  While in Arizona, Freddie, Lancaster, Lancaster's daughter, and her husband all go to the desert and play a game.  The game is called, \\"Pick a Point,\\" where they must pick a point off in the distance of the desert and ride a motorcycle as fast as they can to that point.  Lancaster goes first and returns.  After Lancaster, Freddie goes.  Freddie keeps going and we don't see him coming back.  Some people see this as Freddie wrecking the motorcycle and dying; however, my interpretation of this part is that Freddie has finally escaped his past and has been awakened.  He is finally free of his demons.<br /><br />After the \\"Pick a Point\\" scene, we see Freddie going to Doris' house to find her.  He finds out that she is married in Alabama with two kids.  This does not seem to bother Freddie too much as he knew she was too young for him anyway.  The movie then shows Freddie asleep in a movie theater.  He receives a phone call from Lancaster telling him that he is in England and that he can help Freddie if he goes there.  After Freddie arrives in England, we find out that Lancaster and Freddie used to work together in a past life releasing messenger balloons.  That's where the familiarity comes into play for Lancaster.  After finding this out, Freddie leaves as Lancaster's wife says that he cannot be helped.  Freddie picks up a woman at a bar and eventually starts to ask her questions in the same way Lancaster asked him when he was \\"processing\\".  The movie ends with Freddie laying on a beach next to a woman made of sand that looked like the same woman made of sand at the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was, in my opinion, a very good movie.  It's really a movie that warrants at least two viewings in order to catch every detail that maybe you didn't catch the first time around.  The Blu-ray/DVD/EC Combo pack is loaded with 102 minutes of special features including: \\"Back Beyond\\", which are outtakes and additional scenes, teasers/trailers, \\"Unguided Message\\" an 8 minute behind-the-scenes short, and \\"Let There Be Light\\" (1946) John Huston's landmark documentary about WWII veterans.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is superb; however, I've always been a fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix, so I may be a bit biased.  The story line is great as well; however may be hard to follow for some.  Overall, I give this movie a 5/5 rating.<br /><br />Overall Rating:  5/5
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Amazing read! It was descriptive and moving and a book that I took my time to read and enjoy. A great read before you see the movie!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watch very little television, but I never miss this excellent show!  I am addicted to this wonderful series and hated to see season three end!  I love this show so much, I have started re-watching  it from the beginning,thanks to Amazon Prime.  For anyone tired of all the REALITY shows out there, this series will capture your interest from the very first episode.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a good book for a weekend of relaxing. It was a fast read and was entertaining. I could, like many reviewers, write an essay on why or why not it's realistic or should be taken seriously but I think as far as purchasing this book, enjoying the read, not taking it too seriously, and thinking, hm that was entertaining, it wins.
B0056CUZRA|4.0|Good Story with accurate history facts and would apeal to a large number of readers.<br />God spread of people involved in the story.
B0083DJUMA|4.0|I belong to a maker space and run my own interactive installations company so this book was perfect (and echoing of many conversations I've had). I plan to reference it in future writings because the arguments are well made. A good read for anyone interested in what's happening in your world today, and what your future will look like.
B00ANW33CM|2.0|This was an ok game but not as much fun as the regular mahjong or barnyard mahjong.  I had a hard time playing it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|If not taken too seriously, it's a great read. Entertaining and captivating. Of course, there's tons of social and psychological issues that one could discuss for hours (maybe it's good that it's provoked so many people!) but overall a good read. A bit repetitive after the first book - more of the same. I'm not bothering with the third book but I can say I enjoyed reading this.
B004Y042N8|4.0|This app is super fun. I enjoy doing the puzzles when I get bored. If you want a fun app...here it is!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Might be a &#34;young adult' series but you know what - it's allll about modern society and reality tv and our perceptions and reactions to the world around us and how we dismiss the serious and the many sides of the world. I found this book to be inspiring and fantastic and a reminder of the world we live in.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a lot more fun than the first temple run. It has more cool terrain types such as a zip line or minecart. Awesome. Also, it doesn't make the kindle fire freeze like the old temple run did.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Might be a &#34;young adult' series but you know what - it's allll about modern society and reality tv and our perceptions and reactions to the world around us and how we dismiss the serious and the many sides of the world. I found this book to be inspiring and fantastic and a reminder of the world we live in.
B006O3MU96|4.0|This is a fun app. It has cute graphics and has a fun Christmas theme. Plus...it is a free app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Might be a &#34;young adult' series but you know what - it's allll about modern society and reality tv and our perceptions and reactions to the world around us and how we dismiss the serious and the many sides of the world.

B00884GR0W|3.0|This app is not as fun as minecraft to be honest. It has more animals and characters but it isn't as fun as Minecraft.
B002RI9YE6|4.0|This first person narrative was beautifully written and has layers of meaning. Ishiguro uses hints and subtle nuances  to give the reader a sense of the important issues and meanings under his character's detailed narrative of his life as a butler and his beliefs about butler perfection.  The butler Stevens' avoidance of anything emotional or thought-provoking in his life means that eventually he has to reassess these values and make the most of what is left of his life.<br />It is easy to become irritated with Stevens, who is determined to put minor needs of his employer's guests above his own relationships and human needs. But is  also easy to feel sympathy for him as a product of his circumstances.<br /><br />I like historical novels on the whole, and particularly ones that give a new perspective on a time or people from that time. But I think that there is an even wider significance in this novel - people today, like Stevens, mould themselves into their work personae and measure their own value through work successes or failures (we've probably all done it at times) So I think this novel has relevance for the present.<br />But beyond any moral lessons. this was a good read,
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This game was fun at first. Eventually though, it got really boring and you had to buy certain animals or it wouldn't let you continue.
B005FLX1HS|4.0|I found Skrillex through youtube somehow.  I found myself listening to the Bangarang album over and over as I worked around the house so I bought it through amazon.<br /><br />If you are looking for great composers with incredible skill, get out of pop music.  Seriously, go look at classical and work your way through history and the great composers/performers.<br /><br />That being said, I definitely wouldn't pick this as my favorite choice of music above all others.  It does what I want.  It's fairly mindless with subtle energy.  To me it's relaxation and energy, perfect gym music.  I don't want to walk into the gym tense and angry.  I want the driving energy and power but held with a silk glove, not a gauntlet.  Drowning in music compared to being beaten to death with it.<br /><br />It's just my style.  I love Metallica's S&M album for similar reasons despite not really being a big fan of all the songs on there in their original format.  You can tell from the clips whether you will like this album and if not, google it on youtube.  If you like it, buy it.  If not, leave it be.  Judging anyone's mental capacity based on their music preference is bad form.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game. Like that you can select a random shuffle or a winning game. It's easy to click past the ads too, so it isn't too annoying to have them before each game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching the series after everyone had been viewing for 1 year... I was behind the curve and had to catch up quick... Soooo I watched all of year 2 and then bought this series and have watched all that I can so far... I knew the ending before the rest of the viewing audience. Wow I love this series and hope for more years of watching... Thanks Amazon for providing me the ability to catch up with the rest of the world....
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I would give this an excellent all the way around.  The storyline is quite interesting, the actors/actresses topnotch and we will definitely keep the series as one of our favorites.
B009K0P10K|5.0|After looking all over to get up to speed on this series, I found Amazon Online Video... Wow what a find I made. I found season 2 and was caught up in no time with the latest chapters and am now up to date and have now gotten my husband and my grand daughter caught up in the series.. I have watched some of the episodes a couple of times and they are still great to watch. Love the ability to catch up with the episodes that I missed...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All three of these books are amazing! I've read and reread them all over 5 times!  If you're looking at reading these books then that means you probably have some idea of what they're about.  If you're not comfortable with reading about or talking about sex, then you won't enjoy these books.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Lives up to the expectations with her strong voice and lyrics.  Good songs.  Good voice. Good instrumentals.  What more do you want.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All three of these books are amazing! I've read and reread them all over 5 times!  If you're looking at reading these books then that means you probably have some idea of what they're about.  If you're not comfortable with reading about or talking about sex, then you won't enjoy these books.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like this app but it goes all stutterie on me when I'm not connected to the Internet. like I try to jump but it wont jump and suddenly stop I get soliloquy frustrated but when I'm connected to the Internet it runs smoothly.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put these books down! I'm so happy I was able to get all three in one continuous &#34;book&#34;.  It was much easier to read after seeing the movie, it makes it easier to visualize everything going on (maybe that's just me though).
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Why does it say it is free but when you click it it sayes payment was invalid if you goin to say something is free then make it free.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three of these books are amazing! I've read and reread them all over 5 times!

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I selected this game because of the good ratings. I liked the picture also.<br />Playing the game is a most too much fun. You would enjoy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read this book 3 times and j loved it every time its heart warming and a great romance story
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is arguably the best movie of all time. It has an all-star cast, and manages to be laugh-out-loud funny about an out-of-control war hawk general and the nuclear destruction of the world. &#34;You can't fight in here! This is the War Room!&#34; Directed by Stanley Kubrick, &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34; stars Peter Sellers in two roles, as the President and the partly-mad Dr. Strangelove, George C. Scott as a Patton-like general, Sterling Hayden as the general whose individual coup sets off a nuclear showdown with the Soviet Union, Slim Pickens as a bomber pilot and rodeo cowboy with a unique steed, and a very young James Earl Jones.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I jumped on the bandwagon and picked up this book just to see what all the hype was about. Like many novels, the story was wayyyy better than the movie. Again, this was an easy read that had a hard type putting down until I was done.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love this series..Everything from the costumes..the writing. the acting..Everything is just excellent.This series the best that has been on television in a very long time..Hope we have many more seasons to come.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I can say nothing negative can be said about IL DIVO!  The group is fantastic  Such a gift they were discovered recently.
0440245206|4.0|I give this 4 stars simply because it was a nice interlude read that was easy and entertaining. The story is quite cliche' however endearing. My big complaint is how the author treated the reader as stupid throughout the book by reiterating situations like the reader has a super short memory and would not have remembered. Not having read a Danielle Steel book for umpteen years it just may be the authors standard style.
1476715904|5.0|this book has now become a favorite...I do not usually cry while reading, though I do get emotional...this book had me truly crying and feeling for the characters. I sincerely loved this book and feel that the author did an outstanding job of creating likable, believable characters and a great story. I have already moved on to the sequel Point of Retreat. I highly recommend Slammed, it is a must read and should be on everyone's list.
1613821395|4.0|A well written & captivating short story. A nice twist with a touch of rye humor. Simply delightful and worth the trouble to read.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|love this movie! It had my boyfriend and I laughing the whole time! Not for children, strong adult themes and actions
067960085X|3.0|I found this book rather irritating. I have never seen the movie and I think I would be bored with it.<br /><br />Yes it is well written and quite a smart story however Holly Golightly is an irritating, self centered immature girl. Certainly not a young woman even if she thinks she is.<br /><br />I don't quite get what the gushing over the movie is other than the sex appeal of Holly and the fantasy she depicts.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great App! I really like being able to pull up and see my current weather, wind, etc. as well as check what the upcoming forecast is -- I can find for whatever area I want, it is great!
B004NOH9LC|5.0|This is the best movie I have watched in months.  It is was so funny and had every aspect of a good movie.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It was okay, not much else to say about it. Guess I couldn't understand it in some spots,  just drug on but other spots in the book were quite exciting.
0345525558|3.0|I will admit, this novel held my attention. Even as it did, though, I found it somewhat unsatisfying. I think the characters and even the plot were a bit one-dimensional; I didn't walk around feeling like the characters were a part of my world, as I do with a really great novel. I find the most memorable part of this novel the flower dictionary in the back - the exploration of the language of flowers fascinates.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|Wasn't too bad to work, had some interesting choices to edit. Very creative. I enjoy using it once in awhile.
030796664X|5.0|Interesting. Not too technical with many examples of studies done to make the mapping of habit possible.  I have the audio version and it does well for listening in the car.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is addictive fun! Both I and my husband really enjoy playing it -- I hate the pigs (just kidding)...the whole game is fun and challenging.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I always try out apps before I let my grandchildren play them.  The five year old can play much better than I can and even the three year old was able to have a lot of fun even though he can't read.  This game is family friendly with no violence and appeals to my whole family.  The graphics are very cute too.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|the movie got here on time and was very enjoyable to watch. I freaking love DC movies. and Got it at a good price
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|Starts out slow and the best part is at the end, but sadly not as great as previous. Don't waste your money.
044024630X|5.0|The Jack Reacher book takes you back in time to the last case that he worked while still an army MP. As with his other novels, Lee Child keeps this one at a brisk pace that makes it difficult to put the book down. I have to admit on this one that I figured out who did it by the middle of the book, but the ending kept it very interesting.
B00127RAJY|4.0|These are good sweat-inducing workouts, they get the heart beating, and really stretch out the muscles.  The best thing I like about this video is the audio options -- once you know the workouts, you can switch off Jillian's voice and do the exercises simply to music.  While I find that  the workouts are do-able, just the right duration, and effective, there's something about Jillian's voice that makes it seem that she herself doesn't enjoy the workouts, that the whole process is painful for her (the \\"no pain no gain\\" philosophy I suppose).  Exercising and weight loss doesn't have to be painful.  I have used this and other workouts in conjunction with Weight Watchers and have lost an average of 6 pounds a month for the past 4 months.  And, the experience has been enjoyable.
0743454537|3.0|Picoult is a novelist who knows how to spin an intriguing and complex story, but this novel has one obtrusive and, as far as I'm concerned, entirely irrelevant sub-plot that came close to ruining the book for me.<br /><br />The story of a couple whose two-year-old daughter is diagnosed with an acute form of leukemia and who therefore decide to have a genetically engineered third child via in vitro fertilization, in order to use the blood and bone marrow of that child to keep the older sibling alive, presents a series of moral and ethical conundrums sufficient to fill a shelf-full of books. It certainly provides enough material for a novel just in that one story! Eventually the sibling who is being used to keep her older sister alive rebels and finds a lawyer to argue for her \\"medical emancipation\\" from her parents.<br /><br />But then the author has to over-do it by introducing a sub-plot involving the lawyer the 13-year-old girl hires to plead her case. Who gives a damn about him? The woman (coincidently!) appointed as the \\"guardian ad litem\\" of 13-year-old Anna, turns out to be an old lover of his, and their romantic history and its tiresome developments repeatedly interrupt the flow of the story for no good reason.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is so much fun my falimly love it so much and there's even fun goals take my advise.I love it
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I think that littlest pet shop is a wonderful animated world to explore and collect adorable little animals. Whoever created littlest pet shop is a genius and they are my best friend!!!
0446572764|3.0|As my review title suggests, this novel got off to a promising start... but I found the ending chapters to grow ever more lackluster as the story wound down. This is (of course) a work of fiction, but the wrap-up of the story (no spoilers here) just seemed a little TOO fictional, if that makes any sense. The killer's motivation(s) just didn't ring true in my mind. The whole story builds towards an end that dies in a fizzle. Too tidy. Too practical. Too neat. Too predictable. Like the writer just ran out of paper or something.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it three stars at all was because I think this author holds promise, and I may try the next book in the series just to see if that promise holds true.
1452113432|5.0|When I saw the first episode of her show on the Cooking Channel, I immediately checked whether Rachel Khoo had a cookbook.  To my delight, the cookbook has most of the reipies in her show.  I already made a couple, especially the Croque Madame in the muffin tins and the honey/lavendar chicken.  If she can make these recipies in her tiny kitchen, then I can make there in my kitchen.  I recommend this book to anyone that wants to try their hand at French cuisine without complicated recipies, techniques or equipment.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|By the cover I wasn't sure how Unknown was going to be. It turned out to be pretty interesting along the lines of Liam Neeson as being similar to Jason Bourne. If you liked the Bourne movies then you will like Unknown. It's a little slower than a Bourne movie, but it's similar in the mystery aspect of trying to figure out what's going on with the Liam Neeson character. It's like Jason Bourne in his fifties. Soon there might be Grandpa Bourne, \\"When I was younger I couldn't remember who I was,\\" \\"Grandpa Bourne, you can't remember who you are now.\\" So, to fill the gap in between those is Unknown.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|this was a good movie although at certain times it does get a little slow.  russel crowe is amazing in this movie
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm a teacher and I need to keep up with what the students are reading and learning from books these days. I thought I would be slightly disappointed and I wasn't the slightest disappointed at all. I appreciated the way the author dealt with various topics such as love, nudity, humility, war, predudice, social class, social injustice and even violence. I can take a book like The Hunger Games and teach to so many levels and create the deep, critical thinkers that every teacher wants their students to be when engaged and learning. Excellent read, and very well written for young readers!<br />Cheers Ms. Collins!<br /><br />-Ms. Lee, Tn
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game i have ever play i have play this game for 4 months and have not got bored
B0090SI460|5.0|I know that many if you have seen this movie before and that you probably know what to expect (either from experience or from the many other reviews here), so I'd like to focus on the 3D aspect of the film. Let me tell you that I was very impressed with Pixar's UP and Finding Nemo in 3D, but they do not hold a candle to this movie in terms of 3D depth and quality. My favorite part was the blizzard. The amount of depth seen was ridiculous, from the copious snow blasting down in the foreground, the characters in the middle of field, all the way to inanimate objects in the background.<br /><br />My bottom line: If you like Monsters, Inc. and are looking to dive into the 3D version, I would give it my highest recommendation.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Got this as the FAOTD, and now my kids don't  leave my phone alone! They don't play the free version of minecraft anymore.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun!  The graphics are great...I am a horse lover and I love how you can groom, feed and compete with your horse.
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|Finally a Thriller that doesn't use CGI tricks to keep us on the edge of our seats!<br />The movie is based on a true story about a &#34;Dibbuck Box&#34; (Jewish folklore) which contained<br />an evil spirit (a &#34;dibbuck&#34;) that is unwittingly released by a young girl.  The girl's family is struggling<br />with divorce when the Dad (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) then finally mom (Kyra Sedgwick) notice the changes<br />happening with their youngest daughter (Natasha Calis).<br /><br />The movie is intense and is truly fulfilled by the amazing acting of Natasha Calis. Subtle tears and anguished looks tear<br />at the audience as we watch the demon inside her take over.  Great chemistry between Dad and daughter... truly believable<br />relationship.  Surprising twist at the end.  Not really a horror movie, more of a thriller... but certainly well done!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This new version of temple run is amazing. It has a zipline and it also lets you ride on a minecart. This new temple run also provides a harder challenge than temple run 1.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Second season, came as stated, arrived very quickly. I just finished the 1st season again, and this one arrived just in time.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|Easy to download, and great to be able to watch it when we have time. We don't have a DVR, so we are not able to record the shows. Am thinking about doing HuluPlus in order to watch the current season, if we miss the show.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Loved it a lot more than I thought I would! Hope that seeing the movie does not ruin the book<br /> =)
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Thank goodness this game was free and I never dished out any money for more energy, cash, etc because I am very disappointed. I have had to start this game over 3 times because after helping neighbors I end up with some kind of bug and I get another farm on top of mine. If this had not been my favorite game as a kid I wouldn't even waste my time.
030759565X|5.0|I am smitten over smitten kitchen. I would recommend to purchase this cookbook!! My husband has adored everything I have made out of it. My favorite main was the mushroom bourguignon and my favorite sweet was the gooey cinnamon squares. I used all of her recipes for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year for my family of 12. Amazing. If you are not buying this cookbook after this review, you are missing out.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I bought this to find out how good the series is (my co-workers were raving about it). The first couple episodes were really boring and drugged on and on, after that it was good.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|A real different twist on matching games, with retro simplistic graphics that add to the matching challenge. Works very smoothly on the Droid DNA and makes a great time killer.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first book is so awesome, the other two books do not come close. A little disappointed, but I still read them:)
B004SH40BQ|4.0|I use it when I travel and at the gym.  Perfectly syncs with my bluetooth wireless headphones.  Very compact and reliable.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I thought this book was well written and had a roller coaster of emotions. Looking forward to reading more by this author.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|My bias would show even if I did not declare myself an Asimov addict, as he defines high quality Science Fiction with his novels.  Add to that his incredibly long list of factual science books that are also entertaining to read, and there is no doubt that Isaac was most likely alien himself, unworldly in talent (much like Jimi Hendrix or hsi namesake Isaac Newton, they just had to be alien). While not his most readable of books, his exploration of alien life form is exemplary in detail and logical construction.<br /><br />Asimov adroitly meshes three storylines that are all entertaining, but in an unusual departure from his typical stories, he does not fulfill all expectations for resolution.  Other reviewers have addressed this shortcoming in far greater detail, and I do not disagree with them.  Having ignored this book in the unread pile for far too long, I have been marvelling that it is not one of his more acclaimed novels.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Look, if you have a kindle fire DO NOT buy minecraft!<br />I would of rated this higher 10 minutes ago but then I found out that I couldn't update it!!! Every other device gets instant updates and kindle fire is like 1 year behind! The only reason I found out was because I wanted to make a portal! I looked up how to do it and I saw that you could only do it with flint or steel!!! You can only get flint and steel on survival and I wanted to do it on creative cause I didn't have it on survival! I just think it's stupid! So if minecraft wants more buyers they should lower the price or update it more for kindle fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />  Just saying!!!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Mr Larsson has left a void in the literary world with his early departure, as this is an incredibly great story and trilogy.  Each book feeds off of the amazing characters of Lisbeth and Mikael.  Hidden stories abound, deceit and treachery rule the world and Larsson was put on this earth to make us question our facts, laws, judiciary systems and human nature.  The intricate plot weaving and full throttle pacing keeps the reader eager for more.

B001IF252C|3.0|It works. It's unreasonably expensive. If you're trapped on a mini that needs it like me, it sucks to be us. I'm using it to drive a Dell 27&#34; 2560x1440 monitor.<br /><br />One very odd thing is happening with this cable : Occasionally after the monitor goes to sleep it will wake with a kind of static fuzz on the screen reminiscent of &#34;snow&#34; on old broadcast signals. Resetting the resolution to 1080p and then back to the higher rez seems to fix it.

He breaks the processes down for SPSS so that someone who has never touched the program can understand how it works. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning the program!
0375413405|5.0|Great cookbook, easy and healthy recipes.  REAL butter is actually very healthy especially for growing kids.<br /><br />I put this item in my wish list and someone purchased if for my birthday.<br /><br />As weird as this may sound, I could feel Julia's energy and warmth as I read and prepared her recipes. The reason could be because I used to watch her on TV when I was a kid.  She was full of energy and a joy to watch!<br /><br />A definite for every kitchen!  Love this cookbook!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really liked this book. I grew up on the classic sci-fi of Heinline, Norton, and other (space ships and Mars) type books. It was a treat to read an updated version of the same type of SF. Thanks Andy Weir. Billie Smith - Monterey La

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Maybe it is just the freak in me but Ana ,the main character, is so annoying. She needs to grow some balls and self confidence. She is like that fat friend that is always talking about how fat she is. Also I'm 22 and I know she could not be that much older than me by she could easily pass for a 12 year old. More Christian less Ana . If you read this book you I'll probably get frustrated at the fact she is a little punk and won't just go for it. She is 12 and just started her period . She is that freaking emotional in this book. Granted fairing someone with this sort of taste can be overwhelming  , I personally would have just com for the ride and enjoyed every minute of it but that is just me .hopefully next book will be less \\"OMG girl come on.\\" And more \\" that's right get it girl.\\"  Ps thanks to miss \\"you scare me\\" the book is not at the sexual potential it could be .

B000SEGMAU|2.0|I couldn't get interested in this book. Number one because of my own beliefs about death and heaven, just wasn't matching with that of the writer. I'm usually pretty open-minded and will at least read the whole thing. But I couldn't get myself to continune reading. Maybe I will try again.
0062238868|1.0|After reading \\"No easy Day\\", a wonderful book about the SEALs, I was really unimpressed by this book, to the point where I wanted to toss it away after only a few pages.<br /><br />While \\"No easy Day\\" was well-written and accurate both politically and on a military basis, \\"American Sniper\\" was not very factual, and encensed more the author than the forces he served with.  Calling all Iraqi \\"savages\\" set the tone from the start, and there was no indication that the author had looked at facts rather than repeating anti-French and anti-German propaganda.

B003UYUP58|5.0|As a 25 year cancer survivor, I have so many more questions answered. It was fascinating to follow the history, frustrations and setbacks. My family and I realize how very lucky I am to have survived bone marrow transplant and relapses in the 1980's. I always felt timing was everything with cancer.  Having participaed in clinical trials, cancer legal issues and politics, I feel as if Mukherjee was following my life with cancer and responding to my unanswered and never posed questions.  A new reference book for my library and yet reads like a novel.

B003U0AHBO|5.0|I admire the work of both Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe.  They did not disappoint with this movie.  Even though this was a fictional portrayal as there was probably more than one Robin Hood, I feel it is a significant historical tale that should be told time and again..
B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|The story of teenagers suffering from cancer is told from a new and original angle. Characters are convincing and authentic. I enjoyed this book.
1594487154|4.0|The core idea of the book is that we are all nowadays is in the selling business: selling ideas to our bosses, products to our customers and holiday plans to our families. And also that successful selling today is not about charismatic persuasion but about listening and putting yourself into the other person's position.<br />Pink describes how selling has changed over the last few decades from \\"ABC - always be closing\\" type persuasion to more \\"human\\" cooperation between the customer and the seller. The reason for this change is the availability of information and increased competition. The buyer can easily access product information and peer reviews and thus be very able to spot any foul play. And even if not all the buyers would be knowledgeable beforehand they most certainly hold the power afterwards of hurting the business in case they feel cheated.<br />If you have an idea, a product or a skill that you're sure others would have some use, you have to make other people see the value or else it's worthless. And making others see value, is selling even if you would not be getting any money from it. Pink argues that if you look at sales by this new way in an organisation, it isn't really anyone's job, it's everyone's job. Pink suggest also a new ABC of selling: Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity. Attunement in essence meaning listening instead of speaking, buoyancy meaning positivity and clarity meaning being clear on options and consequences.<br />A great example of non-sales selling these principles apply is management, which according to Pink has changed from giving orders to \\"making sales\\" and making sales is not trying to force someone to do something they don't want to do in the first place, but rather listening and finding common ground where the boss and the subordinate together try to figure out what is the best way to make the personal aspirations and organisational goals match.<br />Pink is a great writer and storyteller and I enjoyed reading the book, although didn't really get all that much new from it. The first two-thirds of the book is clear, logical, well-structured description what professionals need to success in work life social scene and it's filled with lots of memorable real-life stories, but the last third of the book is more or less an incomplete list of marketing and \\"Dale Carnegie-style\\" influence tricks, although some of them no-doubt effective.<br />For the occasional reader of pop-social science or sales literature I would definitely recommend the book, but for anyone who's read for example 7 habits of highly effective people will not get much new perspective from this.

B0085Y4JF0|4.0|Product is pretty sturdy, the quick detach points could be made of more sturdy material but still good. I am a large guy and this extends out enough to fit me. Anyone 2XL or over probably won't fit well. Retains rifle and pistol magazines well so far. You will be fairly high off the ground should you need to lay down in this, so take that into consideration.
B008JFUMT2|2.0|It has been 25 years since the first “Die Hard,” featuring the world’s unluckiest cop John McClane, hit the screen in 1988. None of the three sequels made so far is as good as the original (which was Oscar-nominated in four categories, including Best Film Editing), but they all are still decent action movies – probably much better than “A Good Day to Die Hard,” the fifth installment which is easily the least effective of the popular series.<br /><br />Once again, Bruce Willis’s John McClane finds himself at the wrong time in the wrong place. This time the story begins in Moscow, where John is reunited with his estranged son Jack, in the middle of the attack by heavily armed men trying to capture a certain Russian witness. This is a pretty contrived set-up, but we can ignore it as long as the action set-pieces that follow are good.<br /><br />Action sequences are fast and loud, with so many cars sliding, flipping and crashing into each other, or so many bullets flying and finally everything in sight exploding, but the film fails to build up tension because of the poor editing and redundancy. The film’s action scenes just drag on, not knowing where to go or when to stop.<br /><br />But perhaps the most disappointing part of the movie is the lack of charisma, if not on the part of the star. Bruce Willis’s character needs a supporting character, be it a villain or ally, who can hold his/her own, someone like Samuel L. Jackson’s Zeus Carver or, of course, Alan Rickman’s Hans Gruber. Jai Courtney as Jack McClane is not bad; he is just passable. As to the Russian “terrorists,” they are mere cyphers, absolutely no menace to John McClane from the beginning.<br /><br />With the weak storyline and unmemorable characters, “A Good Day to Die Hard” is at best another routine blockbuster. It is not terrible, but a routine action movie is not what we want from the “Die Hard” series.
B005LAIHTA|5.0|The movie begins in Boston with a young, scared woman running with a bag in her hand.  The police are looking for her.  She gets on a bus headed for Atlanta.  When it makes a stretch stop at the quiet water-front town of Southport, North Carolina, Katie gets out to stretch her legs and just doesn't get back on.  She soon gets a job at Ivan's Fish Shack (local restaurant) but she is obviously hiding from something and/or someone and her fears make her afraid to get close to people, at least at first. While Katie is trying to go on with her new life in the small town, the Boston police, at least one police captain, seems obsessed with finding her.  He obtains tapes of the busses and begins searching.  It's only a matter of time before. . .<br /><br />Meanwhile, she meets local widower Alex, a really nice guy (and handsome) with two young children.  Alex seems immediately attracted to Katie, and the dance begins.  Of course, as any good movie-viewer knows, whatever Katie is hiding has got to surface, cause that's just the way it is in movieland.<br /><br />This movie is part drama and part feel-good.  It has thrills, chills, danger, and love.  It is the story about a young woman who overcomes obstacles to become whole again.  Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel had great screen chemistry.  The very very end was soooo cool, too.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this movie and plan to buy it when it becomes available for my collection.  As a side note, if you liked \\"Sleeping With The Enemy\\" with Julia Roberts, I believe you will like this movie as well for it's similarities.<br /><br />BTW--It actually does take place in Southport North Carolina.  I have to put that place on my Bucket List to visit.

B0050CJNJ2|4.0|Although I love this record ( :) ),  I'd be curious to see where they're headed next in the recording studio.  They are about to &#34;run dry&#34; on the writing processes that in the past has generated and sustained their hard earned, well deserved success and their penchant of making hit records.  This is unarguably their best collaboration, so far, however.  My two cents..

193413712X|5.0|With so many reviews available, I'm not going to address the good/bad of the book (although I loved it from the beginning). I just want to share  my viewpoint as an epileptic:<br />Epilepsy was untreatable and epileptics were often locked up when Howard was living. Epileptics need regular hours and rest. Howard was working hard, excrutiating hours which would have exacerbated his condition.<br />Epilepsy is not typically inherited. It is more usually due to a head injury.<br />Epileptics typically suffer secondary injuries due to a seizure.  When ordinary people fall, they brace themselves on knees and elbows. Epileptics are almost thrown to the ground and they hit hard. While they are seizing, they clench their jaws. Poor George, but Howard wasn't biting him deliberately.<br />Epileptics are associated with mysticism and spiritual,and there may be an actual physiological tie for that. Howard wasn't just mooning over the falling of the snow. He was really living in the moment in the way that others -- like his wife -- could not. George by way of contrast could mark each moment of the passing day with his engineer's precision.<br /><br />Like many people suffering from a disease, Howard was affected by his epilepsy very deeply, and in reading the book, it's important to remember that, especially since he begins to heal towards the end.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series.  Make sure to watch them all.  Beautiful costumes, setting and story.  Maggie Smith is my favorite part of the show.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Yes, everyone knows that Parts 1 and 2 are two of the greatest movies ever made and that Part 3 is a joke - Coppolla's huge ego trip, but seeing them in this pristine collection is simply jaw-dropping on my plasma monitor. The colors are so vibrant and crisp while the sound is just amazing. This is a must-have for movie aficionados.

B009C7JS14|5.0|love this app,its so handy to get weather up dates locally and it other areas that are of interest to me
B007PBKG5G|5.0|The best singer and band I have heard in ages.  They have a somewhat Johnny Cash sound and blues, rock, and just about any other genre you can name.  To me they are a new sound unlike any one. They are just that great you have to buy and you will play it over and over again, and never grow weary. If they don't win an Emmy something is wrong.

B001I8A76A|5.0|I had only listened to PINK rarely.  And I've never really liked her personally.  But I have to tell you, this is one super great album and I've listened to it again and again and again.  Even if you don't like PINK the person, I think you might like the songs on this album.
0307949508|5.0|When I started The Girl Who Played with Fire, I imagined that it would be a letdown from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, for such is the case with most sequels.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  To be honest, the second book in Larson's trilogy is even better than the first.  I found it much easier to keep track of the main characters.  What's more, I found the plot more interesting and the suspense all the more exhilarating.  I know it sounds a bit clich&eacute;, but I found it nearly impossible to put the book down once I reached the last third of the book.  Althoughthe story lacks the interplay between Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, that doesn't take anything away from the story.  In the second of the series, we learn more about Salander, a fascinating and unforgettable creation with a complex psychology. The second book in the series is not just a thrilling read, but tackles head-on many of the issues raised in the first novel.
B002X02V02|4.0|Yeah, yeah, I have a wide range of music likes and dislikes and while I'm not blown away by Lady Gaga the person,  I do like her music.  And this is a very, very good album with a very good selection of her songs.  You won't be wasting your money if you buy this album.  I think it's great.
B009AMANBA|5.0|If you love history & political science you should love this movie. If you love a movie where you can get lost in characters you should love this movie. But if you can't follow a plot without constant, savage action. You should go to a Bruce Willis movie, He's great at what he does but this is not that movie. I saw Lincoln three time & ordered the DVD !!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I've been working my way through some of the interesting Kindle sci-fi books, and this one is a real gem.

B002MUAJ2A|4.0|This book dismisses many of the absurdities surrounding business today. It basically says to stop doing what you think you're supposed to do and just do what you know, and do it really well.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Looking forward to seeing the movie.  Chbosky tells the story that made reflect into my teenage years and had me comparing.  Great read.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|I bought it for &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; and the fact that it's a local artist {Seattle} makes it even more fun.  The rest of the album was a very pleasant surprise.  Very real lyrics, heavy on expletives- so it's not for the angelic or meek of heart.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This was the first book I have read by Brandon Sanderson, and I must say I was very impressed!

B0088W2LC2|5.0|I watched all five seasons of SGA as the episodes premiered on SciFi (and it was still SciFi back then), I bought the DVDs when they became available, and Rising remains among my top five episodes not just for SGA, but SG-1 and Universe as well.<br />I do have a major gripe with the version available for streaming via Prime however, and if there were a way to rate Amazon's service separately for this I'd knock it down to three stars.  (Don't get me wrong though, I do like the Prime service in general; this is strictly about this one show).<br />The reason?  The streamed version is the one for broadcast, not DVD release (there are blatant inserts for commercial breaks, complete with the title screen), and there are even scenes missing.  I haven't streamed any other episodes yet, and now I'm not sure I will, even if it is convenient when I travel, if it means getting an incomplete experience; this is the series premier, setting the tone for everything coming after, and they couldn't even bother to post the whole thing?!  Some of these scenes aren't major, but they all include dialog and a few contain important plot or character development information that may leave new viewers scratching their heads.<br /><br />Final thought: SGA is and will always be an awesome show, but do it justice and watch it on DVD or BluRay.
B0048LPRD2|4.0|I won't bother to tell you too much about the actual film since you can go to IMDB to read about it, but I will tell you that it is a one of a kind movie and you will never see anything like it! The bluray was ok. It is filmed in a manner that has a grainier look to it so things seem a bit blurry at times, but that was the way to blend in the surreal visuals with the reality. It looked grainy on the dvd and also the bluray so not much of an improvement there.
B008NNA6OG|5.0|This is a classic!  I love this musical and Gene Kelly!  Although not a big Debbie Reynolds fan, she was excellent.  I could watch this over and over!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A most amusing and enlightening book. It's almost impossible to stop reading it up to the end!!  Really enjoyed it.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Traditional Scarpetta novel.  Always love the characters and the plots.  Lots of suspense with an interesting but a quick ending.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I read the book and watched the movie.  I loved both.  I may have even liked the movie more than the book!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|this is a very moving story, but can be at some times hard to swallow - great historical fiction read!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|because the cd was great, all the songs, i would recommend it to everyone that loves christmas songs, and rod stewARD
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I have always enjoyed Nelson Demille's character Joe Corey..this book was true to form except that it went on too long before the story really developed which happened in the last part of the book...good read
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|I have watched Lost  for the third time now ,and each time you find things that you say&#34; wow ,&#34;so that's why they<br />it this or that way so cool, and the back ground being in  Oahu  makes it even better.
0385339607|5.0|Ijust finished this one and it was one of the best of his that I have read.  On to reading The associate now
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever! Totally worth all the money(even if it is a bit much) It lets you experiment with architecture and survival. For some reason when I play it I think of the hunger games.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Can't stop playing! Doesn't take very long to get the hang of it.<br />Great graphics.  Easy to learn and play.<br />Recommend for everyone.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie was a gift for my brother; he hasn't had any issues with it, and I haven't heard any complaints. Between that, and the awesome price, I'm giving it 5 stars!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I bought the story yesterday and finished it last night.  The journal entries and the transitions in style between them and the other sections is so well done.  His writing remind me of old Michael Crichton.  I don't write too many reviews, but this book was well done and for 99 cents you can't beat it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|just started playing it and already am addicted!  I love the way you can rotate it all directions.  great free app.!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Found this book a bit hard to get into. Dont know if I like the way the author writes, ie: past, present then past and present again. Needs a bit a getting use to. However, the story is fantastic. Wonderful blend of what  change can break up life long friendships, destroy life long lovers. Amazing how far people would go for the love of their life. Would have been nice if it works the other way around as well.  Loved it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I am writing this on my mom's account: My brother bought the Epic a few weeks ago and I am torn over it. On the one hand; it teaches good hand eye coordination, patience, it is a mind binder, and can be pretty fun.  We like to pass it around and see how far we can make it.<br /><br />On the other hand: Those who created this monstrosity are WARPED and are bent on destroying the will and torturing those who like to take things from start to finish. I have spent HOURS with it and have only made it to check point 50 of 125!!! I have made hundreds of attempts, literally, not joking. Anyone who says they made it on their first try, or even on the tenth try is either a liar or a robot.<br /><br />I would not recommend this as a gift for someone who is easily frustrated, or even hard to frustrate as it will cause a cloud of depression to settle on them and everyone around them. I am not one who is prone to violent outburst of anger to the point of throwing or breaking things, but I will admit to trying to melt it with my brain after the little metal ball, that is clearly possessed by demons to the point it can climb up hill, jumps off the track for no reason time and time again. More often then not, I find myself having trouble getting on the start platform, or getting past the first obstacle.<br /><br />Despite all this, I am addicted to Perplexus Epic. I can forgive the creators of this demonic spear as I do enjoy trying to get it past all the obstacles, twists and turns. I can't imagine how PlaSmart will be able to make anything to top this.
1423140591|5.0|Love all these books.  Very easy read and keeps your attention with no problem.  Readers of any age that even has a remote knowledge and like of the mystical gods should enjoy these books.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|For PG, this is a fantastic film. I enjoy the 3 Flynn's: Clue, Lebowski and young idealist son. The glass/digital grid was more visually satisfying than blood could ever be. The music was great, and Olivia Wilde was sexy without having to be sexy. That's more than this kind of movie usually delivers, and it's better for it. It felt more realistic than gratuitous depictions do.
B004TI5N38|4.0|the books the forgotten and zero day are the kind of suspense novels that i enjoy. can't wait till i finish to get the final results.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app. Could play it for hours. Good graphics, responsive. Can't wait to get it for my Galaxy tablet so I can play on a bigger screen. Looking forward to buying more horses.
B004XQO90E|5.0|This movie is great for those looking for good character actors and intellectual development of a plot. If you like surprises and movie trivia as it relates directly or indirectly to a movie, then you will like this movie. It is worth the money! And don't miss the connection with Quantum Leap! LOL! That's the kind of little trivia that I really enjoy!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|love the graphics ! Interesting story plot, ghostly fun, a love story, something for everyone all ages, bought the full game, well worth it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome! ! my friends. love it. we played for like 6 hours and had thumb blisters :( otherwise its amazing! !!!!!!!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|this series is great! it keeps u on the edge of your seat each episode! I can't wait till the next episode after each one. GREAT SHOW!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It is one of those books that you start reading and suddenly you realize that sleeping is not an option until the book is finished! I read it all in one day. The main characters Sky and Holder share a very sweet love story which I found so endearing and genuine. They seem to be wiser and more appreciative in the significance of their feelings then one might think someone of their young age would typically be. The story was so well written and thought out that it constantly had me trying to imagine the possibilities and explain what answers might lie ahead. Of course I was blown away when the answers finally came as they were not at all what I expected - much more profound than I had imagined and definitely left you feeling ....hopeless. It tugged at my heart to see/feel the love these characters have for each other to see them through such emotional situations. I absolutely loved this book!
B003ELOQCU|5.0|Fast shipping. Thanks. Great product. Will do more from this Seller soon. U2 will wlways be near and dear to my heart. We all should listen to their music and live as &#34;ONE&#34;!!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I purchased this after watching it on DVD from the library. It is a great series with action at every turn. If you love the midevil era, love, politics, betrayl and heroism you will love this series!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very easy good read and was entertaining. Very adventurous. I cannot wait to here more of young thorns journeys.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|How can you go wrong with all 3 Jurassic Parks??? They arrived in great condition in a box set. The price was also great for all 3 of them.
B004XUMRBI|5.0|The story is classic, the characters are genuine. It was a good series and I'm sorry to have only seen one season's worth. Well done and reminiscent of a TV show you'd expect to be only in the past.
B002BWP49C|5.0|If you love the Twilight Saga then this is the DVD for you. This is the 4th DVD in the series. If you havent seen the first 3 then I suggest you do that first.
1932735410|5.0|my husband bought got this book and understood the material way better than in previous attempts.  what a great buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good idea to have a lot of people who are in the game and talk about how fun it is.I would give subway Surfers five stars!!!!<br /><br />  AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0082A3HTQ|3.0|Saw the movie and loved the music. Was not disappointed with the CD soundtrack. Quite an eclectic compilation of tracks but it works. Recommend it, especially if you are fan of Earth Wind and Fire
B00ANGSSWS|3.0|A really long album, has some great songs in it, but not as I was expecting. I like their first two album the most.
B008VBYN80|4.0|It would be a five star rating but you have to have energy just to collect money. That is the only reason why it is bad but otherwise the game is fun.
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|It is one of those games, that if there is NOTHING else to do, I will play. It basically does the same thing over and over, which isn't bad if you like that type of game, I do, depending on my mood.<br />I would never pay for this game, it wasn't all that fun. (got it as free game of the day).
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Good show with a good underlying message. Denzel did a great job as usual and I would definitely watch it again.
B007N85POS|5.0|Love Angry Bird Rio, it is my favorite Angry Bird game! It is one of those games that I never can play very long though.
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|As he ages, Nick Cave seems to court risk even more than he did in youth. After distancing himself from his mellower side with Dig and Grinderman comes Cave's quietest album in ages. That's not to say its laid back in the slightest. There is a dark, unsettling undertow to these songs. And an almost claustrophobic sense of voyeurism.<br /><br />The ghostly We Know Who U R sets the tone by taking you by the hand and leading you through the dew of the morning with trees like pleading hands. Warren Ellis' yearning violin provides fitting accompaniment. Wide Lovely Eyes follows and is one of Cave's most beautiful ballads since Boatman's Call's Into My Arms.<br /><br />At the Water's Edge the women part their legs like Bibles but over all, most of these songs sound submerged in the depths of a vast sea, their protagonists floating in a twilight world between reverie and nightmare. Jubilee Street hints at Red Light District blackmail and murder peppered with surreal images like \\"walking a fetus on a leash\\". We Real Cool maintains a suspended sense of menace which characterizes the entire album. Cave has a long tradition with messing with the conventions of Greek and Biblical mythology and Mermaids continues the trend.<br /><br />Higgs Boson Blues is the albums centerpiece and rises to climax with a sprawling travelogue which includes driving in the Alps, Robert Johnson on the road and Miley Cyrus floating stoned out of her gourd in her pool. Push the Sky Away ends it all with the childlike but powerful simplicity of a nursery rhyme.<br /><br />Cave's records often have much to commend them. As a songwriter he's up there with Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits. And despite any fluctuations in line-up The Bad Seeds prove once again to be one of the most versatile and innovative bands around today. Together they have created a unique, eerie and mysterious masterpiece.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|This is a fun game. Way to challenging, but that is one of the reasons I like it. I got this game as the free game of the day. Even though it is really fun, I probably wouldn't have paid for it. I've only made it to level 7 and gave up with it.
0393324818|4.0|Good Read! Good behind the scenes story about how baseball changed during this period.  Gives more background than the movie.
B00000IQV7|5.0|This is a movie that I purchased for my girlfriend. It arrived in great time and condition. If you haven't seen it, you should purchase it for your collection. I had never seen it, but was glad I did.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|Every Monday night when this comes on its a must watch for me! I'm literally in tears laughing its that funny! Buy this box set! This show is absolutely a riot! I can't wait for season 2s box set its gonna be a must buy!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is super addictive. Tomorrow I will ask My mom if I can get flow bridges. Maybe after I will get flow connect next when I look at the reviews.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is one of the best TV series to come out in the past 10 years.  This show really makes you feel like you are one of the few survivors of a zombie apocalypse and anything can happen.  Many unexpected things happen to some well known characters in this season and it will change everything, yet again.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
0143116177|5.0|Its a great book so far, I am not done with it yet.  I will let you know when I an done.
0345522303|5.0|Excellent continuation on the Nightrunner series. I do hope she continues to write these facinating and fun characters for years to come. It's one of my favorites!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Ted had potential to be hilariously funny. However, it fell flat. I wouldn't say it was great, but the word Okay fits pretty well. Overall, I say watch it if you  have the time and you enjoy that sort of comedy.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!! It's kind of like temple run but there are more obstacles in the game!! It's a great game and you should get it!!!
0307474259|4.0|Very convincing. I wish he an also get into more detail about the saturated fat and non saturated fat. E.G. Coconut oil myth etc.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game. It is fun and helps pass the time.Kids can play as well as adults. Well worth the money.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Blue Sky Riders \\"Finally Home\\" is the best CD of 2013!  Hands down, these 3 critically acclaimed singer/songwriters have produced an incredible debut CD. \\"Dream\\" and \\"A Thousand Wild Horses\\" do it for me. Excellent songwriting & production. Come to think of it, Kenny Loggins should be in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame for all of his accomplishments in his 40+ year careeer. If this CD doesn't spawn at least three #1 hits on the country radio charts this year, there is something seriously wrong in the music business.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is very much a teen book, but at 65 it felt really good, to feel horny again.  She knows lust!!!
B004EPYZPS|3.0|I like it but they could leave out the swearing.  It's bad enough when adults do.  However, the girl did an excellent job of acting, especilally for the film they were making.
B008Q08PIK|4.0|THis movie is a classic. It may be a little slow for modern movie goers but if youstick with it you get t aweet love story that has no happy ending and the lesson that sometimes duty is more important than oneself.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Love this game.very fun and exciting. I like this game better than some of the other games i have put on my kindle.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Simple game. Not very hard.  Would give more stars but hate being asked constantly to rate an app.<br />Two words
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This movie is good because at the end of the movie, you realized you just watched a bunch of depsositions and back stories, but such good back stories.<br />The number of quotable lines, the great acting and the sound track all make this a must see.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I was absolutely pleased with this DVD edition. I ordered it because I will soon not have a VHS player and needed to have Pride & Prejudice always available.<br /><br />I had some misgivings about ordering this when I read reviews; some people said (1) the coloring was too blue, some said (2) the sound quality was terrible, some said (3) the interviews were boring. As to the first complaint, I definitely saw some wonderfully rosy complexions, so don't worry about that. The sound quality was just as good or even better than the VHS recording, and the interviews, while they didn't feature Jennifer Ehle or Colin Firthe, were still worth my time.<br /><br />I'll definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants a copy of Pride and Prejudice.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I got to agree with an author saying this was his best work concerning novellas. Simple as that. Really, really loved it!
B004PGO25O|5.0|Pressfield has stuck a vial of smelling salts under the nose of his readers with &#34;Do the Work.&#34;  Clear and concise, heartfelt, yet gravely serious- just get the damn thing done.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|This is the one that me started i will never wear another companies watch on my arm. Thank you Invicta you are the best!!!
B000W965QW|5.0|Perfect for anyone who has a sick obsession with music or with the number five. You get stuck in Rob's head and never want to leave.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was a book<br />that always kept me guessing, and I didn't want to stop reading it. When I was finished, I just HAD to get Mocking Jay to find out what Catniss will do next!
0740797719|5.0|I feel this will really give me inspiration.<br />I'm a self taught artist and enjoy learning all different different techniques.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A very relaxing, non-timed, soothing game.  No dexterity required; this is a planning game, not an action game.  It really takes me away to another world and I forget about everything.  Challenging but not impossible.  This is one of those games I would have paid ten times as much for, if I'd known how much I would like it.  Works great on both a first-gen Fire and a Droid X.
0740785508|5.0|I am pleasantly surprised and enjoy Gurneys work.  I hope to learn some of his techniques.<br />Very satisfied, I'm sure I'll gain from the experience.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I felt like I was in the middle of a Tim Burton movie the whole time. Some if it I'm still nit sure about. Very confusing and I felt like it went round in circles. Guess I'll have to read it again.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The app is great I absolutely love it but it does crash a lot and asks you to force close it.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I have had zero problems with the game play but I've only been playing for a few weeks. The only issue I have is that my characters don't transfere between platforms. I have an iphone and kindle fire and I can't level the same character on both of them.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|amazing headset great quality of sound easy set up comfortable fit and easy to use durable for long use while gaming
034580404X|3.0|Interesting read.  I enjoyed it more than I thought I would after all I had heard about the books so I would recommend the books to someone who wanted to read a different love story.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game it's so much fun. I say everyone get it it's fun!!!  It great for all ages.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I watch this movie with my six year old grand daughter and we enjoyed it very much.  I don't know how may times she ended up watching it but it seemed like every time I turned around she was on the kindle watching The Adventures of Tintin.
B0015DROBO|4.0|enjoyed the complexity of the story and main characters, with satisfying ending. The one discordant note was the overly detailed technical specs of the Salander's laptop and other technical terms he threw in, as if to prove his knowledge, when instead it just made him sound ridiculous and overcompensating. This improved later in the book when he stuck to the essential, instead of throwing terms around.<br />looking forward to the next book!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I absolutely love the app. It works great and moves fast. App is really cool and I really enjoy it.
0525478817|5.0|Words cannot describe how amazing this book is. But I will try. This is the second John Green book I've read and I was not let down.<br /><br />The book is believable and catching. It draws you in so that all you can do is sit there until the book is finished. I like how even though the plot seems simple - perhaps boring - in of itself (cancer girl finds love with a cancer boy), the story and writing is so well done that you can't put the book down. The characters are relate-able (at least in my opinion). I loved Augustus the most. He cracked me up even till the end.<br /><br />I love how John Green had hilarious scenes and then would put in one or two sentences of deep and thought provoking ideas. This is the type of book that makes you think. And while I'm not always a fan of those, I love how John Green works it into his stories.<br /><br />While the story is a love story it has both its happy and sad moments. And I enjoyed that emotional roller coaster. I stayed up till four in the morning finishing the book. And then immediately afterward I called my boyfriend to tell him how much he means to me. Yes I cried while reading this book - as did probably many others who read it. I cried because I could see myself in the shoes of the characters. I could picture the heartbreak and it felt real to me at times. I was probably reading through teary eyes for the last 50 or so pages.<br /><br />It is an amazing book about life, love, loss and hope. I highly recommend it to teens, young adults and adults. It is definitely a book I'll pick up and read again when I'm in the mood for a sad and yet happy love story.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|I absolutely love the app. It works great and moves fast. App is really cool and I really enjoy it. I love everything about it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I needed a bigger bag because I purchased more gear but the name brands are expensive so I took a chance on this one. For $35.99 I have a bag that holds a Nikon D7000, a Nikon D3100, a 70-200 f/2.8, a 17-50 f/2.8, a 35 f/1.8, a 18-55 VR and all of my other little accessories. Oh and I can even strap my monopod to the side. GREAT DEAL
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love the app. It works great and moves fast. App is really cool and I really enjoy it.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|My Kindle Fire HD has been spending more time on the charger than getting used (read) and this app was a suggestion.  I also read the threads on this topic of the Fire not holding a charge for very long and this app was recommended.  I also did a hard reset, actually 2.  No luck.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I absolutely love the app. It works great and moves fast. App is really cool and I really enjoy it. One of the best and fastest apps for email.
0307742539|5.0|I loved the Movie!! Loved Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig!!<br />Loved every book but maybe because I love courtroom drama and revenge this was the best!!
B002KANXXE|5.0|What a wonderfully written account.  Without giving anything away, I would encourage the reading of the intricacies of relationships, motives, and the awkwardness and variety of such.  Nothing in humanity has changed, but the written expressions of such.
0307949508|5.0|No one could stop with book one of this series!!<br />It just keeps getting better as you go!!<br />Wish the story never had to end but book 3 is my favorite of them all!!
B003U51D58|5.0|Unlike many viewers, I loved Season 6 and I watch it regularly to remind myself how to be and what to expect in my own life's adventure. Why do I see this season so differently from so many others? (Or, for that matter the whole series.)<br /><br />First of all, Lost was never meant to be taken literally.  It's the hero's story, pure and simple, following in the vein of Joseph Campbell. The producers make this point in one of the \\"behind the scenes\\" interviews.  Such stories are written to present life issues to us in a way we can learn and grow, all while being entertained.  In Lost, however, we have something like 14 heroes to watch and learn from.  There is some little part each of these characters in each of us. Who, for example, hasn't felt as totally lost in life as Jack does in The Lighthouse; as demoralized by past events that one regrets as Sayid; as scared by the whole experience as Hugo?  Who doesn't feel that he's going along life's path not knowing exactly where he's going or why, but embracing the experience anyway?  From the Year One shot of people on the beach after the crash onwards, every scene contains life lessons we can learn from.  I have watched each one go thru his/her trials and have compared their experiences to events my own life -- and I have learned from them. Each character mirrors some part of me and I see how I look.<br /><br />Secondly, many have objected to the \\"alternate\\" story -- what might have happened had the plane not crashed.  Haven't we all wondered how something MIGHT have gone had something else not intervened?  The writers get to point out that we all carry with us characteristics that haunt us until we overcome them, as we see when Ben tries to take over his principal's job -- there's still a bit of the angler in him that he must rise above.  And, we get to see Ben finally redeem himself when he chooses in favor of Alex over the principalship and when he chooses to stay \\"in life\\" to work out his relationship with Alex and her mother.  None of these points could be made so well without that alternate story.<br /><br />And, from a still different perspective, is there really \\"death\\"?  Is there really time and space?  Einstein wrote that they were a delusion, and modern science is corroborating what he said.  Alternate versions of the story destroy the \\"only-ness\\" of any one of the versions. Each version is just that -- another version.  And, there's always another one.  Existence becomes holographic.<br /><br />As for the ending in the church, much of the material presented here has been written about by people who have experienced \\"near death\\" and by many who are investigating what \\"life\\" and \\"death\\" really are.  Are they what they seem to be?  Is there ever really life and death? Or, do they reflect one's limited perspective?  And, for those who've studied the issue of reincarnation, this scene certainly brings it up.<br /><br />Frankly, I thought the idea of presenting alternative \\"versions\\"of the story, jumping time periods, and presenting scenes in a non-linear order was absolutely brilliant. They may have come as close as one's likely to come to presenting the universe as the holograph some now believe it to be.<br /><br />Finally, even though the background story of Jacob and the Man in Black seems to interrupt the flow of events, these beings have been too crucial to the story for us not to know their history. Granted, this episode seemed to interrupt, but to tell it any sooner would have explained too much too soon, and it couldn't have been placed any later.  If anything other than the story of our heroes is important to this story it's Jacob and his brother -- the man of hope and the nihilist.<br /><br />Personally, I applaud the creators for such an intelligent work of art.  The story and points made have given me an understanding of life I feel I never quite got growing up - and I wish I had. I know who I want to be like, and who I don't want to be like.  Anyone really want to be Shannon screaming on the beach?  Or Neil pitching his \\"fire\\" fit?  Who would you want to be like?  How do you want to be seen handling life?  Thanks to Lost, I'm reminded that when life upends me, it's really no different from  Kate and Jack being \\"netted\\" while on the path to somewhere.  Any unexpected \\"turn of events\\" is what makes life an adventure. Life IS really very much like being in a jungle on a mysterious \\"island\\" somewhere in space, and we walk the path thru the jungle of life never knowing what's coming next. But, all that ultimately counts is HOW we take whatever comes.<br /><br />And, that's what our heroes ended up doing. The island exacted a huge price from each of them, but look at what they became in return. Each ended up being so much more than he/she was at the beginning. Even Ben gets redeemed! And, that's what we are intended to do: to give our very best to life no matter the cost. To be like Sun, letting her tragic lot play out without bitterness. Or like Charlie, giving his life willingly to help his friends.  Or, like Juliet with her life repeatedly dashed to pieces going on gracefully anyway. Or, finally, like Jack, giving his life willingly to achieve humanity's safety. And, having done so he could indeed depart in peace with a smile because he had achieved a noble purpose - a purpose worth living and dying for. Would that each of us could do so well.<br /><br />So, I suggest viewers take Lost like a fine French impressionist painting where what is is only hinted at, and nothing that seems to be is ever quite so. Don't expect Lost to be a Law and Order type of story. It's the hero's story, meant to entertain and to teach, to teach us all how to live, and it has done both superbly well.<br /><br />As a final note -- one simply has to see the series 3-4 times for many of the fine points to become apparent.  This is as richly detailed a story as a Shakespearean play.  It's small wonder it's being studied by groups to this day.ant to be Shannon screaming on the beach?  Or Neil pitching his \\"fire\\" fit?  Who would you want to be like?  How do you want to be seen handling life?  Thanks to Lost, I'm reminded that when life upends me, it's really no different from  Kate and Jack being \\"netted\\" while on the path to somewhere.  Any unexpected \\"turn of events\\" is what makes life an adventure. Life IS really very much like being in a jungle on a mysterious \\"island\\" somewhere in space, and we walk the path thru the jungle of life never knowing what's coming next.

And, that's what we are intended to do: to give our very best to life no matter the cost. To be like Sun, letting her tragic lot play out without bitterness. Or like Charlie, giving his life willingly to help his friends.  Or, like Juliet with her life repeatedly dashed to pieces going on gracefully anyway. Or, finally, like Jack, giving his life willingly to achieve humanity's safety. And, having done so he could indeed depart in peace with a smile because he had achieved a noble purpose - a purpose worth living and dying for. Would that each of us could do so well.<br /><br />So, I suggest viewers take Lost like a fine French impressionist painting where what is is only hinted at, and nothing that seems to be is ever quite so. Don't expect Lost to be a Law and Order type of story. It's the hero's story, meant to entertain and to teach, to teach us all how to live, and it has done both superbly well.<br /><br />As a final note -- one simply has to see the series 3-4 times for many of the fine points to become apparent.  This is as richly detailed a story as a Shakespearean play.  It's small wonder it's being studied by groups to this day.
0307949486|5.0|After seeing this movie I thought it too late to read the book.<br />I Was Wrong!! So very much more in the book! Could not get enough!<br />Went through all three books in record time and can not wait for Movie #2.<br />Rooney Mara is PERFECT!!!!!!!!!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|This product is no where near as fun and addictive as Angry Birds was.  I completed a few levels before I was entirely bored of it.  I guess if you like to assemble handcarts, this could be fun.  As for me, I'll find something else to entertain me.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is one of the best games ever! I have spent hours playing this and never get bored! If you like Angry Birds you will absolutely LOVE Bad Piggies!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love PicsArt.  There are so many ways edit any photo that you have.  It's simple and awesome all in one!  Definitely recommend it.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This game was a free download over the Christmas Season (Thank You Amazon!) and my whole family has had a good time playing it.
1451695195|5.0|The book was excellent.  It took a lot for this man to come to his conclusion about life and death and more specifically, near-death experiences.  He clearly was convinced by his own experience that there is &#34;something&#34; to look forward to in the death experience.
1250006341|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo30X9SFJXTPMNH]]This companion to Downton Abbey (seasons one and two) is filled with such lush and arresting visuals I had to do more than merely write a review! I hope this little video I made of the chapter pages and included flip-through help illustrate the gorgeous artwork, stunning layout, and massive amount of information to be absorbed in these pages.<br /><br />Fans of the ITV/PBS miniseries will delight in learning more about the Edwardian time period, the daily routines and lifestyles of aristocrats and servants, and the real-life stories about people who lived during this Era. I especially enjoyed the little nuggets of information and history that came from diaries, journals, and memoirs of people who spent their lives in service. In addition, I loved reading accounts and descriptions of the real-life people who inspired characters in the series such as Lady Cora, Sir Richard Carlisle, and The Dowager Countess. I truly believe that every Downton Abbey addict and devotee NEEDS to own this sumptuous, illuminating, and thorough companion novel!<br /><br />Austenesque Reviews
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is amazing I have so much fun playing that sometimes I forget what time it is, but I wasn't sure what the update was going to do to my kindle but my friend got the update and I saw it was ten times better so now I've been trying to find the update and I can't find it and it doesn't show up. Other than that I love this game. I recommend it !!!
B007KYQIEQ|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!  QUALITY IS GREAT ON KINDLE HD.  WOULD RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU LIKE HUGH JACKMAN.  JUST STARTED WATCHING MOVIES ON THE KINDLE AND THIS ONE IS ENTERTAINING.
B0014CDKVY|5.0|The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you want more and to see how it happened and where it does. I have never wanted a sequel or a prequal so badly.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I have watched all of them. They mixed the old and new, but you have to know the first Bond movies to get the hidden parts. Like Money Penny. I thought I was getting a 3D movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a great fun game but Mojang please please please put levers and buttons and pressure plates in it that would make it much more fun
B005LAII80|2.0|The movie was a big disappointment. It was stupid. The guy was trying to be Sly Stallone. I watch allot of 3D movie's and this reminded me of the ones that sell for a dollar.I hate wasting my time and money. Two stars was generous.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I wasn't thrilled with the storyline, but watching Channing Tatum was worth it! Oh my goodness, he is such great eye-candy and dances so sexily! His back-up guys were okay, including Matthew MacConaughey, but when Channing was dancing, the others just sort of disappeared for me!!<br />The female lead lacked the fire she needed---she couldn't match his real life wife's performance with him in a former movie.<br />But, for a chick flick, a girls' night out/get together, this movie is good. How could a couple of hours with your BFFs and Channing Tatum be a bad thing? Just keep the cheering down to a quiet roar so the neighbors don't complain...
B00A18KCSQ|5.0|Been listening to them for about 5 years and followed every single, album, and live recording they've released. This album shows the growth of the band as a whole, becoming fuller and stepping away from the arid feel of there previous album but replaces it with powerful choruses and beautiful instrumentals. Any avid Math Rock/Indie Rock listener would and should indulge in this album.
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|I didn't know what to think of Push the Sky Away when I picked up my exclusive advance copy at a neighbor's recent garage sale. However, I quickly became impressed with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds after listening to this CD; I think they're an alt-metal band based on the songs I've heard on this CD!<br /><br />What I think speaks to me on this CD is the fact that Nick Cave knows his way around a guitar. Yes he does! The way that he plucks the strings of his 6-string is just unbelievable. He's almost as good as the guitarist from 3 Days Grace and even the guitarist from Trapt. Yessir. Almost! I also like the Bad Seeds, which I think, if I'm not mistaken, is a reference to his backup band. The Bad Seeds ain't bad as a unit; they're almost as good (almost!) as the backup band of Hillary Duff when she goes on tour. Almost!<br /><br />I love songs like the fourth one and the ninth one on this CD. They are such stellar offerings that, for but a split second, I almost forget the hellish cover up of the Benghazi scandal that Obama has spearheaded from day one! Unbelievable, homes! Unbelievable. I think the fourth song is a Morrissey-style offering that really rocks like Joan Jett on speed, while the ninth song is kind of a Linkin Park-style song that makes me think of 2001.<br /><br />Please buy this CD right now, folks. The best thing you can do right now is go out and stimulate the economy, so buy this CD from Amazon right now! You won't regret it, dude.
B00005JLPK|1.0|I know this was a used dvd, but for some reason the movie dont work on any of my dvd players or my computer. I dont blame the seller about this, i blame my self for buy used stuff.. I buy a new one from a different seller,and that was one of the best movies i love it!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|The graphics are wonderful, but the regen time on energycould be faster. The game would go much faster if you didnt have to pay for things needed to enter rooms.
1609611543|5.0|I am still reading this book, and it expresses a very interesting viewpoint.  I love how the author includes some real life cases and the effects of his no-wheat diet.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I liked this one. It shows more of who Ethan is and how he is finding his place in this world that he is living in.
B002ZP1STK|5.0|This is one of those you will never forget. Full of hope and optimism it will leave you teared up at the end. Top 10 for me all time I think and I have seen it a dozen times perhaps? You will not be disappointed if you love music and a good story.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I would rate this album as one of the best that Maroon 5 has ever released! If you like Maroon 5, buy it
B006PKV2QU|4.0|&#34;I Think It's a Rock ...but Maybe Not!&#34; by Peter W. Collier is a cute rhyming bedtime story for young children. Mac is coloring with chalk on the sidewalk, when he feels something in his shoe. He thinks it's a rock, but then thinks maybe it's not. His imagination carries him away as he considers all sorts of possibilities. Could it be a small piece of chalk? How about a bee, maybe even a queen bee who will call all her soldiers to set her free! Maybe it's a spider who will tie his toes together with its web, so it can suck on all the good stuff there!<br /><br />Soon Mac's Mother comes to the rescue, as she chides his wild imagination. So what does she find in his shoe? I think it's a rock... but maybe not! This is surely a soon-to-be favorite with your &#34;read me a story&#34; bedtime crowd... well worth getting.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I love this whole album! Christina shows off her versatility by singing a duet with Blake Shelton, and she actually sounds liek a country singer, yet on all her other songs, she sounds like the powerhouse she is!!  Great!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandson loves this. He wants to use my kindle to play every time I see him he asks for it.
B001I8A76A|5.0|Pink is so versatile!  She rocks it as usual on this album.  I would buy any thing she puts out.
0061689246|1.0|I watched the movie a million times and wondered what the book was like and I was disappointed.  The movie was a better story.  I made myself finish the book because I kept telling myself that it would get better.  NOPE!
B004Y042N8|5.0|Great addictive game!<br />A good way to pass time when waiting for kids, doctors, or any other kind of appointments.

B005LAJ23A|5.0|This is my favorite show wrapped up in the magic known as Blu-ray. The quality is fantastic and the show as always is as well.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|Robert Pattinson was amazing and the movie followed the storyline from the book. And Paul Giamati even though he was not in the movie that long, he played his character to a &#34;T&#34;.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Kids learn a lot about friendship.  It is a great family movie, well made with great acting.  Interesting enough to keep adults interested and kids totally engaged.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|I have read the book and the movie kept pretty on track.  The actors, especially Robert Pattinson and Una Thurman were superb.  I would highly recommend it.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This is one of the BEST horror movies i have seen in a while...the acting is supperb..and is a great movie from start to finish...and it is VERY CREEPY!!!

B00846F1YW|5.0|It a very fun game to play it not to easy and not to hard. Hard to stop playing once u start it worth the money
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The research behind this book was incredible. As an introvert, I could relate to many of the issues that were discussed. This book made me realize that it's ok to be me!
