B00B99KJR0|3.0|Not worth paying for.  It's a jewel game with a stolen story.  Has no variety of puzzles, and doesn't transfer to the SD card. It needs to have adjustable difficulty levels, because the timer is too fast on some levels.
B0001XAODY|4.0|This movie shipped quickly arrived in a great condition and was decent to watch. I am happy with this product I would recommend it again.

B0063GORYU|1.0|This will not work on a Kindle Fire. I have loaded it twice and both times when I tried to drag cards from one column to another they won't move. I have no idea what the problem may be but even though the price is zero it isn't worth the aggravation.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|All the other books were good, but l never would guess that this book was so addictive and twisted,It really knocked my socks off. The end of every chapter was filled with suspense, and I didn't want to stop reading! The Kill Order was amazing.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book will really change the way u look at what life is or should be about...especially if u are like most of society and live life in go-mode and allow time to mean more than what truly matters. Finding this book was a blessing....you'll be glad you read it!!!!!!! :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I read in a long time could not put it down. Coleen Hoover just became one of my favorite authors.  Will be buying her other books now to read

B0060MYM7O|5.0|I bought the combo set as a pre-release and so far only watched the blu-ray version, which is excellent. Enjoyed the audio commentaries and extra features. Amazon lowered the price after the release date and automatically credited me the difference without having to ask. Looking forward to the third season!
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I've often wondered how his older sister is still in school if he is a senior. He was born in 1962 and she was born in 1960. Did she stay back twice?
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Sorry, despite the great reviews, I found this a tedious and boring read. What happened to the Stephen King of old? The story line seemed interesting at the outset, but then it turned into chapter after chapter of repetitive back and forth between the main character and his love interest. Cut out most of the middle and this could have been an interesting book.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|nickelback has such honest music...no trying to make it all nice and proper...just raw emotions. they are the best as far as I'm concerned.
B004SEUIWO|5.0|The video was excellent. Will keep until DVD's go out of style. Acting was superb and quality of video was excellent.
0062082353|5.0|CHRIS KYLE saved so many lives in combat...the irony of his death was he was shot and killed in a non combat situation by a troubled vet. he left a grieving family and a lot of grateful americans that thought he was a hero!! everyone should read this book...he tells it like it was not the version we get from the biased media. he is sadly missed by many!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really am enjoying the game.  got me playing a lot the first night.  the graphics fantastic and life like  thanks SM

B00005JMJG|5.0|Not your traditional love story by any stretch, but in those terms becomes one of the most real and endearing. Probably the best performance by Jim Carrey I've ever seen. Watch this on a date night or with friends, it's lovely!

B000002JEV|5.0|A BBC recording's always good value; contained within this set is a studio version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" I've never heard before and live, the same song recorded 3 times within about a week - totally different every time! Led Zeppelin in full flight - no wonder they became the most successful band of the 70's by the early '70's!!!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Doesn't seem to remember where I live. Always opens in New York. I finally deleted it. Other apps were easier to use.
B00008OWZC|5.0|It's Led Zeppelin live - they knocked over the USA & blew away the then-biggest band (US) in the world when their own country (England) ignored them! They displayed that live performances could be more exciting than supposedly over-produced/over-overdubbed (some tracks containing 3-4 guitars/recorded in sections rather than as continuous performances) albums - what could be wrong a live CD or 3?
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Easy to set up and works great as a booster for my powered speakers. I use it with my cell phone and Spotify! :)

B0043WDK2G|5.0|Had to see this episode after only seeing part one! Will have to break down and buy the rest of season three!
0425263908|5.0|loved the storyline and steamy sex scenes. the limo love scene couldn't have been better!<br /><br />was annoyed at eva's sudden temper tantrums and accusations of gideon doing unfaithful things to her.<br />I was touched by eva's traumatic history as a rape victim and by gideon's child abuse history and the fact that his father committed suicide when he was only a child.<br /><br />I got so upset when Corinne came into the picture. I was so afraid during the course of reading the book that eva and gideon would split up. there were so many opportunities for a split to happen that it kept me on the edge. so many women could have been for gideon but yet, he chose Eva and still stayed with her when she told him of her past. and this is why I loved the storyline. the author chose two characters with severe traumatic histories. and yet the sex and the love still came about like fire. yes, they were so sexually attached to each other all the time, but they were trying to find a way to be with one another. it seemed like they were better off being alone at some point in the book but the fact that they knew of each other's history and needs just couldn't keep them away from one another.<br /><br />I couldn't wait for the second book and pre ordered the third one. it will arrive in june and will probably read it in one day..
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Temple run Oz is the best game by far that I've ever played, the great scenery just makes the game even better!!!!!
0374533571|4.0|Excellent book that I think both sexes would enjoy. Read this book in about a week, I couldn't not put down. The quickest I've read a book in awhile.<br /><br />The Silver Linings Playbook, centers around the character of Patrick Peoples, a man in his mid-thirties, who has just been released from a mental institution and is living with his parents as he tries to piece his life back together. He obsesses over his ex-wife, as he can't remember several years of his life, including his break up or what landed him in the institution. He befriends his neighbor, Tiffany, a young widow who has been in a deep depression and has moved back in with her parents.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing the movie.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Did we expect too much, perhaps?  With LOTR already having set the bar soaringly high, it seemed as The Hobbit's first of three acts, this being &#34;An Unexpected Journey&#34; had no choice but to disappoint. And seemingly a 300 page book stretched to three movies is a bit of a stretch- in fact, the book's infamous opening line, &#34;In a hole in the ground, there once lived a hobbit...&#34; doesn't ring out of the speakers until exactly 9 minutes and 18 seconds into the movie. Thing is though, people have to realize that this isn't something epic... well, it is, in its own way. But it's the beginning of something epic, first and foremost. The Hobbit was always a simple tale, and while the simplicity is there in this first act, I can gladly say that the Hobbit deserves more put into it than perhaps people want to admit. As the great grey wizard himself says, &#34;All good stories deserve embellishment&#34;.<br /><br />I saw this film twice when it was in the cinemas- once at midnight in 48 FPS and again two nights later in IMAX 3D at 7 PM on a Saturday. While I loved it then, at the same time I needed to give it time to &#34;sink in&#34;, sort of. People fail to realize that as simple as Tolkien's masterpiece is, there's more to it than the books allow us to see. The appendices are full of material that add to both The Hobbit and LOTR, and I'm glad to see they brought some material into the film. One good example was how they handled Radagast The Brown- played by Sylvester McCoy, formerly of Doctor Who fame. His inclusion could have been a disaster, but the way they handled him, he fit in there comfortably, and his role in the story does a lot more than most realize.<br /><br />What really did it for me about this film though, other than what they included and excluded (because face it, it's a MOVIE, not a book. The book was great but it's time to hand in our brains and just try to enjoy the movie) is how they handled the story in terms of tone and technicality. The first half charmed me and was just plain cute. Sure it had the typical &#34;R-rated opening&#34; that the previous films had, but after that, when we get a glimpse into Bilbo's life and the introduction to the 13 elves, from there on it is as endearing as a beloved children's tale. Yet even then, the first half isn't afraid to get all dark and gritty- Thorin's telling of the story of the White Orc is beyond tragic and you really feel for the elves. And when we shift into the action-packed second half- from there on the film just blows your mind. I loved Gollum's cameo- it was funny as hell and scary too, and his scenes with Bilbo are just as fun as the intercut action scenes between the orcs, Gandalf and the elves. Also, the last 30 minutes may be the most exciting in a while. I can't remember the last time I've been that on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Is The Hobbit a &#34;great&#34; film, per se? Maybe not. I don't know, honestly. All I know is that I really enjoyed it, as a fan of the book, and if anything, as high as my expectations were, they weren't high enough, if the multiple viewings were any indication. I definitely feel that the book has been done great justice, and it does what all &#34;first act&#34; movies should do- leave me wanting more. Sure it's full of flaws, but isn't everything, nowadays? And besides, The Hobbit gives another few years of Middle Earth to look forward to, so that's a plus. I'm proud to say that Jackson has proven himself to be a great adaption master yet again!e first half charmed me and was just plain cute.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun to play!!!! Entertains me when I am bored. It's easy for me to get diamond's but pretty hard for others. I wish the competitions would be a little faster.
B0080K3G4O|4.0|I'll keep this short. The only real flaw is that it's a bit anecdotal at times. Overall, I see this book as an explanation of purpose for emotions and affects we typically associate with ONLY negativity. All emotions and bad moments in our lives have purpose -just like the good ones.
B00ARVRD1Q|5.0|I have an extensive collection of 78s, including a lot of &#34;Hot Jazz&#34; from the 1920s.  I also produce a weekly two hour &#34;Old Time Radio&#34; show for the local college radio station.  The Bryan Ferry Orchestra's &#34;The Jazz Age&#34; is an effective and engaging trip back in time 90 years.  Very well done, capturing the sound quality and recording limitations of that era, but more importantly this release is an exciting and spirited set of tunes true to the essence of Hot Jazz and what made that music so special.  Kudos to Ferry for thinking &#34;outside the box&#34; and coming up with a real gem.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Works perfectly with the Kindle Fire. Doesn't add to the bulk or weight of the tablet. Could be a bit more protective.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|So never had a problem with this app. If you don't need the interface at your side get some simple stereo speakers and plug this app in. To all that love this and haven't plugged into a stereo format with this I humbly beg you to try it. Especially with the binaural beat aspect of this program. I could be wrong,  but I would imagine you would have an increase of the intended purpose of this program; as well as love it. I do!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to use and entertaining. I would recommend it to someone as a leisure game to play, there is no real action which I like.
B007REV4YI|4.0|but also up there with all the current Bonds.  I think Daniel Craig will be around for a while : ))
B002JVWR9U|5.0|excellent shape , like new. very good quality. Nothing bad to say.<br />I cant wait for the season four !

B00B671W6W|4.0|Anthrax's choices of covers for this EP may not be agreeable to some of their fans, but I can appreciate what they're going for here.  If you've only ever stuck with the albums, you may not be aware of the covers Anthrax have done throughout their career.  Radiohead, The Police, U2, The Sex Pistols, Discharge, KISS (quite a few times), Celtic Frost, and Husker Du are only some of the artists who've been given the 'thrax treatment over the years.  Thin Lizzy and Cheap Trick were also covered about 10 years ago as well.<br /><br />It's not surprising to me that covers of songs by Journey and Boston are here (\\"Keep On Runnin\\" and \\"Smokin,\\" respectively), being that Joey has openly admitted to being a fan of both band in interviews over the years.  Joey's also got the chops to pull off the vocal range and the EP's strengths, to me, are in these covers.  The Boston cover might be the best thing on this release.  They pretty much nail it.<br /><br />I like the choices for the Rush and Cheap Trick covers, but minus a star for execution.  Charlie Benante turns in an admirable effort for \\"Anthem\\" but the playing and pacing feels sluggish and a bit too heavy.  It's missing a bit of the \\"bounce\\" of the original.  The cover of \\"Big Eyes\\" is done well but I would have preferred to hear Frankie employ an 8 or 12 string bass.  Tom Petersson gives a lot of added weight to the bottom end of songs like this and it's just a bit flat and empty in that respect on this, for me.<br /><br />In all, it's good and worth the 6.99 purchase plus the Auto-rip.  I wouldn't call it an essential purchase but for 7 bucks, it does what it does well.<br /><br />Now let's hope another 8 years don't go by before the next Anthrax album!
B000KUD2G4|5.0|I was a bit skeptical in the beginning, because the humming noise for our church's monitor was very loud.  I know it was because of the ground looping problem, but wasn't sure if this cheap device can complete get rid of the noise.  We plugged it in, and wow, what a difference.  The sound was very clear.  I would certainly recommend this to anyone who has the ground looping problem.
0525423656|4.0|This is a good series. I do wish the book had more exciting events that were different. Good over all.
030758836X|1.0|Can't believe I wasted precious time reading this book - I'm thankful I got it from the library, and didn't also waste money.  Why anyone would give it more than one star is beyond me.  Not well written, completely unbelievable, and was crass to an extent that made me uncomfortable at times (and I am FAR from a prude).  I kept reading, because I thought it had to get better, considering all the great reviews and the references to a \\"stunning\\" ending.  Unfortunately, it only got worse, and the ending was anything but stunning.
0142420891|2.0|The first book was MUCH better. This was not what I expected at all. Could have been better thought out.

B009LXEBD4|4.0|I bought this one for my daughter. It's a great CD. It's fun. We can't wait for Kelly's next Greatest Hits-Chapter Two but we're looking forward to the many years and songs that we'll get to enjoy from her until than.

B00785P2QC|5.0|Had fun playing it.  I would recommend it to a friend. Very realistic .It is a  really good game. Exciting .
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The mouse and the Software Program that comes with it could not be better thus I give it a 5 STAR rating even though I do<br />wish I'd bought one that was more LEFT hand friendly...........I only have the one hand and it definitely was NOT made with<br />lefties in mind.  It still deserves the highest rating!!!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Always loved the MIB movies.  This one's the best!  The guy they chose to play young K was PERFECT!! This movie is action packed, funny and moving.  The special effects are awesome.  This movie is Great!  I'd recommend it to everyone.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  I like the auto finish feature and the graphics are good.  It makes a good game for break time.  I like the auto save as well.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The people are the same in both but different relationships. Good and easy read. A read once kind of book.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Enjoy the game, but agree with others that the hints still display even after unchecking the option. Having hints shown to me after only a few seconds of consideration of my next move is actually distracting and detracts from the enjoyment. Especially when the suggested move is often a strategically poor one. That's why I give 4 stars.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|One of the few albums worth purchasing in it's entirety. This could have very well have been a Micheal Jackson album. Many similarities yet a bit on this side of the millennium. I just reactivated my old MySpace account. Good music can make you do strange things.<br /><br />Two Thumbs up! way up!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />3-26-2013<br /><br />Replaying the hell out of this CD . . . . I've had this CD for a week now and undoubtedly this is a great CD. Justin's talent is undeniable - just to think that he was an 'N Sync member. I guess some people just have to do the dirty work before that can get their foot in the door. I hear he's got a second album coming out this year as well!! If it's anything like this one, he's got my chunk of change.

B00B1E6FF8|2.0|Update: 1/20/16 Just read a great review by Eileen Jones (look for it). &#34;It’s one of the hammiest films I’ve seen in recent memory, full of those big phony “moments” when the whole room stops so someone can say his or her big line and get a big contrived reaction.&#34;<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/9/14 In light of the Senate report on &#34;CIA torture&#34;, it's important to point out that this movie is not quite a documentary. The depiction of torture therein has been disputed by many, including Jose Rodriguez, Jr., head of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center from 2002 to 2004 and then director of the National Clandestine Service until late 2007.<br />&#34;Despite popular fiction -- and the fiction that often masquerades as unbiased reporting -- the enhanced interrogation program was carefully monitored and conducted. It bore little resemblance to what is shown on the screen. ... To give a detainee a single open-fingered slap across the face, CIA officers had to receive written authorization from Washington. No one was hung from ceilings. The filmmakers stole the dog-collar scenes from the abuses committed by Army personnel at Abu Ghraib in Iraq.&#34; If true, the film does a terrible disservice to our men and women in the CIA. I also urge you to read the rebuttal to the Senate report at ciasavedlives. I'm taking one star off for plain deceit. OH - and I managed to sell my copy! Update ends.<br /><br />This is NOT a &#34;high-voltage thriller&#34;. It's actually quite tedious.<br /><br />For most of the movie, you will be watching a police procedural. Some torture at the beginning may be the most interesting part; the raid at the end is mostly in too much darkness. The rest:  investigation, investigation, investigation, punctuated by a couple of explosions.<br /><br />The heroine, Maya, becomes insufferable. Yes, she's obsessed with finding &#34;UBL&#34;. But she becomes horribly arrogant, telling the SEAL team &#34;You're going to kill him for me.&#34; It's one thing to make her a bad-a**; here they overreached. After that line, I couldn't take her seriously anymore, and I didn't care about her character. Except for finding her contemptible. Near the last third of the movie she is put on such a high pedestal and praised so much - super smart, super confident, etc. etc., it's frankly quite nauseating.<br /><br />In another part we are treated to watching a Pollyanna-ish agent (different woman - are there really that many women in the interrogative services?) getting giddy about meeting and interviewing a potential lead, terribly endangering the people around her by insisting on relaxing security measures. Some tragedies ... are avoidable.<br /><br />It is interesting watching them track the cell phone user who leads them to UBL, near the end. But the raid, as I said, is botched - it's usually too dark to see what's happening, except for the night vision parts. I tried different settings on my TV, and it didn't help much.<br /><br />And they didn't show UBL using his wife as a human shield. A strange omission.<br /><br />Speaking of omissions, one character says that &#34;the President is a thoughtful, analytical man.&#34; So thoughtful, in fact, that he took 13 or so hours to decide to give the go ahead, and then only after he had crafted a document to sign that absolved himself of all blame in case anything went wrong. (The blame would fall upon the military.) They left that part out. Strange.<br /><br />I will probably be selling my copy. Maybe that's why Amazon's not letting us sell them yet? (Like Argo.) RENT AT REDBOX (or something comparatively cheap) FIRST to see if you want to buy. I wish I had.eached. After that line, I couldn't take her seriously anymore, and I didn't care about her character. Except for finding her contemptible. Near the last third of the movie she is put on such a high pedestal and praised so much - super smart, super confident, etc. etc., it's frankly quite nauseating.

But the raid, as I said, is botched - it's usually too dark to see what's happening, except for the night vision parts. I tried different settings on my TV, and it didn't help much.  And they didn't show UBL using his wife as a human shield. A strange omission.  Speaking of omissions, one character says that &#34;the President is a thoughtful, analytical man.&#34; So thoughtful, in fact, that he took 13 or so hours to decide to give the go ahead, and then only after he had crafted a document to sign that absolved himself of all blame in case anything went wrong. (The blame would fall upon the military.) They left that part out. Strange.  I will probably be selling my copy. Maybe that's why Amazon's not letting us sell them yet? (Like Argo.) RENT AT REDBOX (or something comparatively cheap) FIRST to see if you want to buy. I wish I had.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome.I play it so much and its adicting. I begged my parents to get It and they said it was a wast of money but they were wrong by so much but the updates make it more awesome!!!
B000RIWB16|5.0|I was very pleased with this album, although I was bummed it didn't come with a download card, as I had heard others say that it did come with one.  But the sound quality on the vinyl is top notch.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I love the hunger games series! I would recommend it to anyone, however this last book I felt dragged on. I didn't like how they separated peeta and katniss for almost the entire book, and then quickly summed up the ending. I felt like I was living day to day with them on got bored during the middle. But overall, it was a good book and a great series
B003Z9Q4S0|5.0|Very pleased with this album.  Although yet again I was hoping for a mp3 download card as people on here and other sites have mentioned it does come with one.  But I guess they quit sending them with the vinyl.  But Jack White takes his vinyl seriously and the sound quality is pretty amazing.
B00000JFV9|5.0|My Husband loved this, and I lost it ,so this was a great buy and now Ihave a happy guy
B005URRCNQ|5.0|This album really did it for me.  IMO, it's far and beyond better than the rest of the Black Keys albums.  I can completely understand why it was nominated for Grammy awards.  And thanks to the Black Keys for including the CD as well.  I'm not much into listening to an album over and over again, but this is the first one in a long time that I cannot get enough of.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This item was bundled and shipped early...was very pleased since it was a gift for my son's birthday which was the very next day

B008VVT51U|5.0|I loved this movie, I would recommend it to everyone,but especially anyone over 60. Maggie Smith and Judi Dench are magic.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|As the second season of Game of Thrones picks off right where the last one ended, the plot thickens! If you love Tyrion, aka the Imp, then this season is definitely for you as his intelligence and sense of honor becomes unparalleled. I don't want to give too much away but I will say that the Young Wolf continues to rise in the North while the Mother of Dragons spreads her wings across the sea. Just watch it; you won't regret it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|5 stars!!!!! I love love love this story of bravery, selflessness and determination to remain human in an inhumane world. And I love that it isn't some girlie love story.. satisfying from beginning to end..
1450419895|5.0|If you are really determined to do a good workout this book has everything you need to know or learn about the workouts, your body, nutritions, you name it!
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|If You want to watch something with Your kids, that will reveal secrets of real life, with safety and danger, love and hate, friendship and loneliness, then this series is good choice. Unfortunately, polish speaker is not available in most of Disney Adventure series, including this one.
0736092269|5.0|Simple book to workout with. If you know what muscle you want to workout with just look that muscle up and it will give you lots of exercises for that muscle. It will also use colors to show you the muscle it works and will tell you what muscle it works the most. PERFECT!
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Because this movie completed my Jame Bond collection.  I now have all the James Bond 007 movies. Thank you very much.
B000083E79|4.0|This CD has a variety of songs with Cher and Sonny and Cher. There are alot of CD's out there but for the money, this one has alot to offer.
0439023521|1.0|I realize I'm apparently in the distinct minority in that I don't believe quality writing should trump a story that is morally bankrupt.  The admittedly absurd plot involves putting some 24 randomly chosen children and teens into some sort of cockamanie arena to murder each other while the whole nation looks on.  The author then makes the main character some sort of a hero because she survives by among other things shooting one of the other children through the neck with an arrow while that victim is in the process of driving a spear into the body of a twelve year old.  For me that crosses the line.  Every time we have a mass shooting you hear the cry of \\"how could any person be so desensitized as to do such a thing.\\"  I realize it is a stretch, but when a book like the Hunger Games is a popular as it obviously is, I would just say \\"well, duh\\".  I normally send my books on to friends after I read them.  Not this time.  Unless one of the sanitation department workers extracts it from my garbage can, this book is on its way to the landfill.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|Very well done. Just misses out n Disney Greatness, but very good overall.<br /><br />Seven more words required to complete this.
0385349947|4.0|I think people in the media unfair judged this book before reading it. The author offers some insight into little ways that women can sabotage themselves unknowingly and also how to make the most out of one's career. She uses anecdotal stories along with researched data to make her point

B0054JZC6E|4.0|its not perfect.. i have it for my DS and it works better on there.. o  here its way more difficult. im not saying its a bad game but its not as fun because its more complex and hars to deal with when im bored.
B00BQXM558|5.0|my kid loves the games in this app. one of the better English learning apps ive seen.  not just flashcards but fun fun games.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I was a little skeptical at the outset since this album was being offered for less than a dollar, but the CD and case were in like-new condition. Talk about affordable!
B006YXTRHY|2.0|This movie is so boring. So glad I didn't gone waste my money on it at the theater.  I'll still watch part 2 if it's free, but hopefully it won't be so boring.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Nice OEM controller to replace a old worn out one.  This is a OEM SONY CONTROLLER and in my book worth every penny when you need one.  Cheap controllers last a fraction of the time and then usually have connection issues, not this one - it's PERFECT every time.  Price is competitive and as always Amazon ships FAST!!
8866130931|2.0|Not great for planning, 2 pages for a week on a small notebook not enough. The appointment times are strange - why would you need to set appointments at 1 in the morning?
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|Seriously? People are listening to boy band music again because one of them was in some facebook movie and wears a suit now? It sounds like car commercial music. Things that remind you this is the yuppie generation all over again.
0061733199|4.0|A mix of practical information you may need in an emergency and less practical information if you are stuck in a jungle. Just flipping through it I learned facts like what foods you should and should not eat in the wild. Did you know there is a mushroom that is safe to eat on it's own, but poisonous with beer? Also a helpful list of what you should have in your car in case of an emergency. A bit slow on the shipping.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Relaxing game and easy to play. This is much better than carring  a desk of cards with you. I play every night.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I have a Polaroid Colorpack camera and I LOVE the fact that I can buy this film for it and still use my 40 year old camera! Pulling tabs out of the camera to get my pictures was a different experience, but that's why I love my camera. The pictures turn out GREAT! Very crisp and clear. Do NOT throw away the negatives - You can scan them and then invert them and get beautiful scans. There are plenty of Youtube videos that will walk you through the steps. Again, AWESOME film - Fujifilm - never stop making this film!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I had to get used to the small screen,but I play it often. I like the flying birds whyou break tne cages.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|It's okay. Some of the music is catchy but overall it's not as strong as their last album. Still love Muse.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is another one of those apps I downloaded because it was free and I enjoy playing a video game every once in a while.  The reviews I read were favorable and, since I was curious, I downloaded it.  The graphics are just as advertised.  You draw a stick figure and his stick buddy and go off on an adventure.  It is, in the simplicity of its graphics, programming genius.  I'm no gamer so I've yet to finish the game (that probably says more about my gaming abilities than I intended) but I've got to tell you, this is pure, simple fun.  I applaud the creators.
1451695187|5.0|Easy quick read. very interesting. helps to relieve the fear of dying as it's very believable. I think it's wonderful to know that our soul lives on. Highly rec. this book!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci creates another suspenseful mystery with a twist.  Quick, fast read leaving the reader wanting more introducing a new character with a past!
1926778103|5.0|I enjoyed every single piece of artwork in this book. Mr. Madureira is an extremely talented artist and every fan of his work must get this book.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, but expensive.  It's also nice to have the 5-6 player extension, because the game plays well with that size of crowd, and it's a bummer to leave people out.  This, of course, only increases the price...
1401229921|5.0|Any fan of Batman should have this book. This book gives the reader a different view of the comic book with no inks or colors. If you're into the penciled look of every page, then you should get this book.
B001KR9AP8|5.0|This recording wasn't DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE by any stretch of the imagination, but I found myself really enjoying this disc.  In my opinion, the headboppers were on point and the slow jams were a little more passionate than in any of her past recordings.  This cd carried me thru and I really loved it.  I wish that it hadn't been broken up in two discs, but I guess that's the reason for the season...get the money while it's out there.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|Case is a little on the flimsy side.  I would buy a better quality one next time!  When this one wears out.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I got this first (prior to II) but I get annoyed that every puzzle has the same forms on it (repetitive) that is why I ordered II. And, then I just got the same icons, to  me there is no challenge.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I've been using these headphones for 40 hours a week over the last 4.5 years.  Simply put, they're amazing!  I wear them during the day while working, as ambient noises greatly disturb my train of thought.  Prior to purchasing these I was cycling through cheaper headphones every 6 months or so. Usually they would physically break or the wiring would go bad.<br /><br />At some point I had enough, and decided that maybe it was worth the extra money to just buy a single pair of headphones and make them last.  After talking to a few audio and music enthusiasts, I was pointed to the AKG 240's.  I haven't regretted it for a second!  They're light, comfortable, sturdy, and the audio quality is excellent.  Even better, you can purchase replacement ear pads (which I recently did and it made the headphones feel new again) and wire.  It's cheaper in the long run to buy these rather than cycling through $40 cheapies every 6 months.<br /><br />Buy these you won't be sorry.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|It has great graphics and game controls. Missing a star because it wont open from the title page after a few hours of playing ( is that my fault? ) :( I'm gonna have to uninstall and lose my progress to try again :'(
B000TEUSJK|1.0|just a soft porn film disguised - terrible acting - the stars just took the money and ran - made very cheaply
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wow!! I read this book in 3 days!! I couldn't stop reading it!! This book was recommended by friends of mine and I can't wait to thank them! Great read!
0765326353|5.0|I originally checked this book out from my library because I enjoyed Brandon Sanderson's other books, and I loved it so much I bought my own copy as soon as I finished reading it! Don't let the length (1000 pages) intimidate you - the story is incredibly well-paced, never dragging on or making you feel like you're waiting for things to really get going.<br /><br />The characters are diverse and lovable, even the ones who only show up for a chapter or two (there are several I'm desperately hoping will play a larger role in other books in the series). The magic is unique and fascinating, and the world - with its history, culture, politics, climate, geography, and flora/fauna are all so well thought out and original that I want to go back to this world over and over again. (As an aside, Brandon Sanderson is the only author I've read who can make the physical world of a book feel so real and interesting. I'm a biologist, but this is the first book that's made me wish the fictional plants and animals were real so I could study them!)<br /><br />The series is going to be a long one - 10 books in all, with the second volume due out later this year - and I absolutely can't wait! Sanderson strikes a delicate balance between giving this book a genuinely satisfying ending, and yet leaving enough unanswered questions and unresolved dilemmas to make me want to buy the sequel the day it's released!<br /><br />All in all, I simply can't recommend this book highly enough.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The end of this story couldn't have been more tragic or more perfect. The loss of so many makes the end of this story so much more than a work of fiction. Suzanne Collins has managed to tell the story of anyone who lost someone they loved and live with the guilt of their part in it. I really appreciate a story that can move me to tears. Once again thank you so much Suzanne Collins for your beautiful and powerful story.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I get to watch movies when my boys are asleep and this movie had me covering my mouth so i would not wake them. Its not like most other movies and has funny parts that are worth watching/owning this movie
B003JA5NVE|5.0|What a way to end the series! Loves these girls and the cast they have supporting them. I would highly recommend this series!!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I read this when it first came out in book form and look forward to reading it in this format.
B000KZFMZI|4.0|This is a great season where you see the friendships take on new facets and the beginning of Ross and Rachael.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I haven't read a book in quite a while.  I was curious about this book since everyone was talking about it. I read all 3 books in record time; they all maintained my interest.  I hope E L James continues on with the story in some way because I would surely read them all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game my daughter loves it...every bit of it is exciting. Its a kids version of temple run and fun to play<br />Over and over again. Excellent game.
B002KKCVR8|5.0|Love amazon saved 30 bucks off retail and ordered on sunday and got shoes on thur what great service too.. Sandals rock great arch support, but still breaking them in im sure with wear they will be comfy as my old Tevas...
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I don't know why I need twenty or more words to say that this DVD was OK! It was OK.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I love this game! It was a little confusing at first, but as soon as I figured out how to drop the items off the playing board I loved it. If you like Bejeweled or any other match 3 games, you'll like this one too! Definitely worth the price.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|so much fun. graphics are awesome! a must to download. makes me wonder y the state gave me a real license though. lol!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The Pocket Edition for Minecraft is the best game for Kindle Fire. I reccomend using the Creative Mode first as then you can freely place blocks and learn the controls. Also there are no Creepers or the like to mess up your world. Then,  when you get tired of eternal daylight and peacefulness, you can create a new world and choose the game mode to be survival. Here, you start with nothing but yourself. The first step is to punch a tree and craft a crafting table, which gives you a 3x3 grid instead of a 2x2 one.<br />  I could go on and on over the epicness of MineCraft, but I don't want to ruin others' fun. Creepers do that already. Note to Remember: If you hear a 'hssss' then RUN!<br />  Its a bit dissapointing that PE (pocket edition) doesn't have wolves, Endermen, Jerry (Slimes), ocelots, the End or the real Nether, or even the clouds, sky, or sun, (at least on the Kindle Fire edition) but as its only in Alpha its still being updated by Notch and Mojang, as are the X-Box and PC editions.<br />  Congrats to Mojang for another excellent game and I expect great things from you!
1579129129|5.0|a friend of mine was raving about this book and asked me to order it from Amazon. I had it sent directly to her. It was &#34;New&#34; from the seller and at a greatly discounted price from the original retail. The seller delivered exactly what was expected. The book has been a thrilling experience for my friend. A pleasing transaction overall.
1452113432|5.0|This is so fun and great twists on the genuine classics..males FRENCH cooking not so difficult. Two breakfast dishes I crave all the time. I am a huge fan of the food network show as well. Don't miss it ir the bk.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Enjoy playing the draw something game. However, the game has slowed down and now does not show the opponets trying to guess what you drew. It is taking longer for you to play. Don't know if I will continue to play. These bugs need to be worked out.
034553154X|5.0|I love this calendar. I got one for both my boyfriend and myself. The artwork really brings back scenes from the books.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|This was bought for my son because he saw it on T.V. one day and became obsessed! We watch it all the time. It arrived quickly and works perfectly!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|A great way of teaching sustainability to kids.  The singing and the music are great, too.  Loved it.  My nephew and nieces have memorized the songs already.
B007HACDLK|5.0|We need R E A L  people like Mitch Rapp!!!!!!!! We need more people like the main charictor in his book
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Intrusive in its permissions and not very reliable. Again it's very intrusive and I don't trust this app maker any longer.
0802473156|5.0|Easy read, big impact.  I'd recommend this to anybody as it can help you understand all your relationships, not just romantic ones.  Further, I would really recommend it to any couple about to get married or those who have been married a long time.  Great insights; some new and some old, but a great read nonetheless.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Gilmore Girls: The Complete Series Collection has given us many hours of watching pleasure of this fun, witty series. One of the best parts of watching them on DVD is that we don't have to watch commercials. Now that we are retired, we watched the entire series over this last couple of winter months and enjoyed watching and laughing together. My husband and I are both glad that we purchased this collection with the nice carrying box and books with information about the series.
B00A17AD36|3.0|I thought I would have enjoyed his album more; however, after the first ten songs I got tired of his voice and the content of his lyrics. Thirty songs is a lot to only be singing about sex, drugs, and &#34;love&#34;
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is the best way to do your math homework and your teacher would not even know hopefully. so that's why you should get this app
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I absolutely love Bruno Mars. This album stays on repeat. I can listen to him sun up to sun down and never get tired of his beautiful voice. Gosh I love Bruno Mars
B00BESIKWM|3.0|There were only two good chilling parts and was not nearly as good as the first movie. Looked more like a video game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this series but I have been hooked since the first episode. Wonderful show and fascinating characters, so different from anything else on television right now
B00B19F3PG|4.0|It was good. The movie started out with a very thrilling part and that led to high hopes for the rest of the movie which was pretty good.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|All the tracks on this cd are amazing. They just pull you in. I love so many, but &#34;Empty Chairs At Empty Tables&#34; & the new addition<br />&#34;Suddenly&#34;  hit the spot for me.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This was by far the BEST version of Snow White I have ever seen. Was very dark and melancholy the way I always imaged it would be in the &#34;real&#34; world.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|The music is haunting and yet familiar at the same time.<br />My favourite is the Misty Mountains Cold. Although in saying that there are many tracks that transport you to another world.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I can't write a review for this because I haven't see it yet. All I have seen so far is the preview.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|This album is in my opinion Kamelot's best album to date.  It has all the feelings of a Kamelot album with the melodies, strong opera and symphony vibes, while not being stale and boring as &#34;this is the same stuff&#34;.  New lead vocalist Tommy Karevik is absolutely incredible.  When Roy Khan left the band I was unsure how I would feel with a new singer because he was all I knew.  But after hearing a few songs and getting to see him live, he blows away any expectation I could have possibly had.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a very easy quick read that you don't want to put down.  Even my husband like it.  :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading this series at first, kids killing kids is not what I would consider interesting. There is a story here that is well put together. I will reread this series again and again

1608955702|4.0|Great book, lots of good information and well packaged up for those who prefer to read a physical book then to go through Neil's website, where a lot of the information already is.<br /><br />My only real complaint about this book is the &#34;build quality&#34; is fairly bad.  It feels like a lower quality binding job, with the pages not *quite* fitting together right.  However there's no issue with the spine or quality of paper.<br /><br />Definite recommend if you're an amateur or mid-level shooter interested in getting more information about making your portraits pop, and learning to see different lighting options all around you, from natural light only to one flash to multiple flashes.  The focus is not much on gear, and much more on technique and seeing light.  Highly recommended.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Always liked the puzzle games; Fun-fun... Makes passing idle time worth it all!! Keep inventing those must play games comming.
1582701709|5.0|Simple, short, life changing, yet deep and inspiring. I have bought over 25 copies to give to friends at a time when they can use some hope and motivation! Extraordinary!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Very good.  I couldn't put it down.  I'm a big fan of Nicholas spark.  He is a favorite author of mine.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Had me from cover to cover, Hoover has a way of making the audience FEEL like they're a part of the book and that everything that Sky goes through, we do, too. The main character is easily relatable on every level. She [Hoover] took an interesting concept and executed it brilliantly. I just don't believe in perfect otherwise this novel was easily a 5-star piece of work.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book was great.<br />I really loved it, though the first time I read it I didn't like it. It is a great book.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|The collaboration here between Susan and Derek is magic. When Susan softens her vocals, you can just feel the emotion coming through.  Derek Trucks's solo albums always featured his guitar works, but his guitar here has a more mature(?) sound to it. Every note is well placed and played. The balance between Susans vocals and Dereks guitar sounds like a working marriage (no pun intended). Its two people playing as one. The band does an outstanding job and I always liked the sound the organist presents. The keyboards on this album deserve to be listened too as well. The song writing, production make this one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. I agree with the other reviews that from the first to the last song, none are weak. This reminds me of albums from the sixties when you listened to every song.  This is truly an Album and not a bunch of sonds thrown together.  I am already anticipating their next album. This one is a winner.
B00A83075M|5.0|Bought this for my nephew,and he loved it.He had been waiting for it on DVD because he missed going to see it at theaters,which are so outrageously overpriced!! Plus got free 2Day S&H so no complaints here.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have always been pleased using Amazo for<br />all my purchases. Their policy is fair on any<br />tractions and their employees via phone or email have always been helpful,courteous,and knowedgeable.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a wonderful app to have. It can help with the children's homework. I love the fact that it has all the extras on it like hangman and the horoscope....I'll be using this with my 2 year old. She's very smart and it will definitely get her into learning words. She already wants to go to school. :) definitely recommend this app and I will be buying dictionary pro.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is like a real horse without the horse poop and all the work that comes with a real horse.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|If you're a Reacher fan, you will fly through A WANTED MAN. If you're not, you might want to start with an earlier (older) Reacher to get into the spirit.<br /><br />Early on, the book exudes the typical whimsical, mildly sarcastic Lee Child style that we fans can appreciate. Irony. At the same time a bit difficult to believe as being a real-life situation.<br /><br />I found the first quarter of the book to be a little \\"non-directed.\\" But in most Reacher books this is the case. Mr. Child likes to take Reacher (and us) on a bit of an Alice in Wonderland / Mystery Tour for a spell before he begins to sketch out any real purpose. The beginnings of most Reacher books are \\"about nothing,\\" as Jerry Seinfeld might say. Just a guy hitching rides.<br /><br />Long before the half-way mark, things happen. Hostages, shootings, disappearances... Intrigue. Honor. Righteousness, but never self-righteous. In the end, as in ALL Reacher books, we have a very smart (and street-smart) man. A nearly monstrously-built, intelligent gentle giant. A man who exhibits foibles of the most respectable types. Small flaws in appearance and action that make Jack Reacher both a mountainous hero, and a regular guy. The guy most decent guys want to be!<br /><br />You will not regret the exhilarating time spent reading this book... Having the opportunity to walk alongside Jack Reacher. (Don't call him Jack--nobody else does.)
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|I spent extra for the complete package with the digital copy and found I am unable to actually use the digital copy. This is not an iTunes copy which is how I (and everyone I know for that matter) manage all of my digital media but instead some site that wants you to register and create an account. It sounds like this is some streaming product instead of a digital copy so, again, beware of the misleading advertising.<br /><br />I am currently debating if I am going to return this or not. To the best of my memory when I preordered this a long time ago the \\"UltraViolet Digital Copy\\" was not there, it only said Digital Copy because I've had run ins before with this service and it would have been a huge red flag for me.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I cannot remember the last time I had to switch to an audio book to get through a novel. The story is entertaining but the writing style of Martel never flowed for me. I just couldn't get immersed.

B008EKON56|5.0|If you've been looking for a way to still charge your i-Device while using the LOD connector, then this is the ticket.  I love this adapter - clean sound output with the ability to charge at the same time.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I have watched this several time and enjoyed each time.  It is a fun movie and I will watch it again soon
B00785P2QC|4.0|Virtual City is a wonderful game if like to challenge your ability to be creative. Its hours of fun. The only thing I would change would be to have a rotation when building. Some buildings don't look realistic if the entrance is to the side of a road.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I enjoy this program and have missed many weeks, so this is great, and I'll enjoy when I wish to.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Well written and well thought out, it was truly a pleasure reading. Twists and turns that will leave you wondering how you never saw them coming. Can't wait to read the next.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I enjoy the program and all charaters.  I love to laugh and this program hits the spot.  Thank you very much
B007HACDLK|5.0|another mitch rapp story with the cia.  This has really been a wonderful series.  I really enjoy the spy aspect of this series.

1451696191|1.0|Heterosexual sex, oral sex, rape, homosexual sex, abortion, drug use, sexual abuse<br />Our protagonist is exposed to all this in his sophomore school year.  There are no negative or positive thoughts expressed on any of the above acts in the book, but the wallflower is soundly criticized for one act:  thinking of others before himself. I have thought about this book a lot and I've wondered if my negative impressions of it are due to my 56 years of age. It's possible, but I really don't care what your sexual orientation is or what you do with it, and I don't care if you use drugs (as long as you don't harm society in the process). But I do yearn for a more genteel society which is clearly not present, nor condoned in this book. If the author's purpose was to provide a springboard for discussion, then I think he's succeeded. But I wonder if this point is missed by many of the 5 star reviewers.
1878424319|4.0|Very practical guide for self improvement and positive thinking. Could relate to people and situations. Definate booster to help improve moral.
B00AG51RU6|5.0|I like Bruce Willis as an actor, it was a good movie, and Henry Cavil played a good actor as well.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I enjoyed it very much even though it was a dark book.  I hope young women will read it .

B00AHEDXXA|3.0|This film was technically good I liked it and wanted it to be in my collection. But my family did not like it.
111846446X|5.0|This is an excellent intro to the Pi and covers history, basic use and simple programming. A good starter book to this amazing piece of technology.
B000N6UERK|4.0|Deja Vu is a 2006 crime action thriller with elements of science fiction directed by Tony Scott & produce by Jerry Brukheimer starring Denzel Washington as special agent Doug Carlin from the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Fire Arms & Explosives and Paula Patton as Claire Kuchever victim are the main characters on the movie and the film is about special agent D.

Washington's partner - Adam Goldberg as DR Alexander Denny - Elden Henson as Gunners and Erica Alexander as Shanti .<br /><br />This movies starts off with a big explosion sinking of the ferry in New Orleans and at first keeps you wondering why and gets even better towards the end but a bit confusing in some scenes & according to some critics this movie received mixed reviews and one was below average ,Filmed before and after Hurricane Katrina , I didn't mind Deja Vu and picked it up for a good price with a good picture and sound a PG rated film approx 126 minutes long and rating it a 4 for a good show  .
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Story and graphics were good easy to maneuver through would gladly recommend. Cant wait to see how the sequel carries on the story.
B00B23O96A|1.0|I believe an imposter has recorded these songs...this is a terrible CD.  Where's the old Eric Clapton gone?  All of these songs are dull, slow, boring and some not even his own.  Very disappointing!
B0015FML06|5.0|This is a great package, putting together the &#34;mini LP&#34; (how is 34 minutes a mini? I've got &#34;full length&#34; LP's shorter than that!) with the expanded DVD version of the video package.  I've been listening to this a lot since I got it, even ripped an audio CD of the DVD soundtrack (for my car). Great nostalgia.  I just wish they had included I Fall Down, and the bits of other songs that were edited out. But I won't knock a star off the review for that.  The packaging, liner notes, pictures are very nice.
B000NY12LO|5.0|. I like her books because they deal with real contemporary moral issues. This one tells the story of bullying and its effects on the givers and receivers. It is so typical of the behaviors of teenagers. It was painful for me to read because it is so true. Excellent character development of typical teen life in all its wonder and ugliness. I would highly recommend it to all ages. Would be a good discussion opportunity if read by parents and their children.
B009GFEOY8|3.0|The price paid for such a volatile product is just another justification of the raging nostalgia appeal behind this and similar products. Give it 5 years and the might have a decent product in an affordable range.
B008476HBM|4.0|I chose this book because I have seen the movie and I knew I was missing something. I love to have the blanks filled in. The only issue is the manner of speech which is a little hard to follow.
B009GEYX5E|3.0|This film is priced way too high for such a poor emulsion. Even understanding that they are developing, I would never expect to pay this amount for an equivalent beta product.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|It does what it is supposed to do, it charges my phone. The coiled cord is handy, keeps the console area cleaner.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Great streaming rate as well as better than DVD quality. The only complaint would be that it requires a beast of a wireless signal to maintain the stream at HD quality.
B003O86FMW|5.0|@ first I thought it was going to be all happy but then a ton of awesome action comes in like blowing up the arena!!!!!!! :D
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|From the music to the lyrics, this CD is a MUST for every music lover!!! It's folk with a hint of new sounds. It is an amazing CD!!
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|In just the past year, Bastille have released several singles that are readily available to view on the internet. Their latest is \\"Pompeii\\" which has the voice and passion of a Coldplay track but with added synths and guitar riffs..<br /><br />This may well be England's next best artist and \\"Bad Blood\\" will end up being in the Top 5 cds for the year. It will bring them the well-deserved world fame and attention that Emeli Sande's debut cd brought her last year. Nearly half of the album's 12 tracks could easily become singles played on Top 40 radio or in the world's best clubs....
B005LAIII0|5.0|The 411 by Maria:<br /><br />In it's most basic form the movie is about Pi Patel, the only human survivor after his parents commission a ship to move their zoo from India to Canada. Along with Pi is an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra that broke it's leg when it feel into the life boat and an adult Bengal Tiger (who is named Richard Parker).<br /><br />After the other animals are killed by tiger, Pi and the Tiger learn to coexist on and off the life boat until Pi is rescued in Mexico 227 days after the ship went down.<br /><br />OK...now that I gave you that very brief summary, let's get into how and why I liked it so much. The movie is exquisitely done with amazing cinematography and CGI effects. I truly love how beautiful it was and wish I had seen it in 3D!<br /><br />Pi played by Suraj Sharma as the shipwrecked younger Pi and later Irrfan Khan as older Pi, is amazingly resourceful as he struggles to keep himself and Richard Parker alive.<br /><br />My husband says it reminded him of Tom Hanks Castaway, I can see why he would say that but visually, it is way above Castaway.<br /><br />Very cool effects!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graghics are amazing and the game itselve is just so fun! their is so many things you can do. it has unicorns and magical forest. I have real horses and this game is just like taking fare of a real horse. GET THIS GAME!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have placed this app on my tablet and phone.  It is most comforting when you cannot carry the book with you because it makes others uncomfortable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed the book and all the twist and turns. Interesting characters and relatable story line. Loved the character and the &#34;rumor mill&#34; concept... Great to know the truth.
1401937268|5.0|this a beautiful deck the only thing that i how ever do not care for is that they are nothing like the traditional deck they are gental and safe but there is to much sugar coating with them in my opinon please make sure that you are skilled in the art of the tarot before you get into this deck. because you ar not dealing with suits you are facing the elements they are associated with. the major arcana is completly renamed. as stated above beautiful deck but I would not suggest this deck for a beginner. also the cards are  bit large and can be hard to work with if you have small hands like me
B000X5SPBI|5.0|think the video quality was great and big fan of the series think the price is kinda  high for the series but enjoy it.
B000001Y79|4.0|Great band that I've always liked and there were no scratches on the disc. The whole plastic case that it came in was broken all over but I was happy the CD was fine.
6305280762|5.0|My mom loves this movie and since I am her go-to person for movies, (she doesn't like shopping or buy things online) she asked for this movie for her recent birthday.  She was so excited to open it and it was great to see her face.  She wasted no time in watching it.  I trust buying used and I was very happy with the condition this one claimed to be in and arrived in.  I will be borrowing this movie from her as I've never seen it and am a fan of a number of actors in it.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|I liked how the movie came in a time appropriate manner. Plus there are no scratches on the disc as I had hoped.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|The concept of delirium was very intriguing. I think Lauren Oliver did a great job delivering the story and it was a good book, but there was something missing. I don't know what it was, but it will not hinder me from reading the rest of the series. I liked the way Lena fought for love because that is something I believe in. If I lived in that society I would go crazy. So over good book and hopefully the next one will be the same.
B000002MY3|4.0|Came in a timely manner and it's a wonderful CD with no obvious scratches. There was some cracks on the case but I don't mind, I use a CD case for all my CD's anyways.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|it is realllllllly addicting and awesome I find it to be a great game and even though a small industry made it the industry will most certainly become a massive corp
B0096HI226|5.0|BRAVO ...... A movie about male strip tease done with  CLASS!  Channing Tatum is awesome in this, and I hate to admit I am middle aged and LOVED it.
B00162GWFS|5.0|The speediest metal band known worldwide. Tom Araya&#34;s descriptions of hell described as a dark , demonic imagery of the coming Armaggedon , thermonuclear war , and the perverse destruction of mankind&#34;s soul. Tom Araya&#34;s creative lyrics is accompanied by quick guitar solos and fast drumming by Dave Lombardo. Abandon all hope you who enters here.
B00385TM3K|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Michael Douglas and or Andy Garcia.  It is fast paced and very realistic.  Its a shame BUT something like this is probably happening right now.
B0011Z32PS|5.0|An excellent compilation of heavy , thrash , and speed metal music. James rhythmic guitar riffs matched his growl. Kirk&#34;s guitar solos soars with every break in the songs , Jason&#34;s deep growling bass , and Lar&#34;s prowess on the drums sums up a force to be reckon with.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|This album is fantastic, songs are very catchy and lyrics are great.  Another homerun for JT! I at first didn't care for the album, but after listening to it a few more times I grew to love it.
B001229W22|5.0|It has a good mix of heavy , thrash , and speed metal music genres. Catchy tunes to make you headbang along with Lar&#34;s upbeat drumming accompanied by James and Kirk&#34;s quick guitar riffs and solos during gaps in the songs. I recommend this product to all the world&#34;s headbangers.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|very good game. held my attention and very good graphics. well worth buying the full version of this game.  would definitely recommend to others.
B0093X805W|5.0|My daughter loved this book very much. She is eight and loves Roald Dahl. This is one of her favorites.
B008YCMM2A|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite line up and this box set is a great document of a group that never recorded in the studio.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This was a very detailed book. It got kinda boring at times but it was worth every bit.<br />Thank you George R.R.Martin.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I still think about this series every now and then. The sex was definitely kinky but I was more consumed with the lives of the handsome Mr. Grey and Ana. I could not put this book down and it's one of those series you never want to end! I recommend this series to anyone who loves romance,drama,and a little action.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't usually write reviews but this one was good enough to change my mind. Will be buying Walking Disaster as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a good bork and I've been thinking of reading the trilogy again I loved it so much. The author does a great job of hooking you in and keeping you entertained!
B00377V6J2|5.0|If you like the Blues,you'll Love, Albert King.Albert King is one of the Old School,Blues Masters. Stevie Ray Vaughan is New School Blued-Eyed Blues,at it's BEST. Combined, you have two MASTERS of BLUES GUITAR. This CD/DVD is worth every penny of the price you pay for it. Enjoyment, tune after BLUES LOVIN' tune.Buy several,and give them to your BLUES LOVIN' friends & family.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in about 3 days. I had to read the next one ASAP! I was drawn into a world I didn't really know about but found myself dreaming of my own mr. Grey. He is so complex and broken. I do love my husband very much but it nice to escape reality sometimes:)
B0026772N8|5.0|This is a classic. I've read it many times and now it travels with me as an e-book wherever I go.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved every aspect of this book.  Well done, and nicely written with great character development.  I would recommend this.
B00746O3X8|5.0|It works so wonderfully, I love it.  It was exactly what i needed.  I have joint issues in my shoulders, and this harness does wonders. when my shoulders start to bother me, i just hook the camera's to the harness, and take a break.  I would say everyone should have one of these in their photography equipment.
B007UXT6T6|3.0|Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg make this movie watchable! A lot of the scenes were very predictable and too much CGI.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Yes, this is an R rated comedy, so if your into immature humor, then this movie would be for you.
B00A83075M|5.0|My kids and I watched this movie for the first time last week, and I absolutely loved it. I watched it three times in two days and am currently obsessed, which says something because as much as I adore animated films, I usually don't feel compelled to watch them over and over.<br /><br />This movie is like \\"Toy Story\\" for the younger generation. Instead of toys, you have video game characters that come to life and interact with each other when the arcade closes. The concept of the story is so original and interesting, and I fell in love with all the characters and the father/daughter type of relationship that formed between Ralph and Vanellope.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting this movie to tug at my heart strings the way that it did. Admittedly, I may have cried once (or twice) while watching it.<br /><br />John C. Reilly was perfect for the role of Ralph and brought a lot to the character. Sarah Silverman also did a wonderful job as the voice of Vanellope.<br /><br />My kids, 6 and 2, both sat through the entire movie, which is also a big deal because normally they get bored and antsy during most long animated films.<br /><br />In short, this movie was fun, enjoyable, and heartfelt. The dialogue between the characters will make you chuckle, and it had quite a few parts that made me laugh at loud. I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't have kids. It's one of those films that anyone can enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW!!! Wonderful read. When I started this book it consumed me. I cried, laughed, smiled a lot and it was just amazing. It took me 2 days to read it. I couldn't stop, BUT I did have to sleep. I would highly recommend this book. Absolutely loved it!!! Thank You Colleen Hoover for such a good read.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|I bought this for my mother's birthday, she really wanted it, knowing the main character was from Band of Brothers. Well she couldn't get past all the nudity and the swearing.  I'm sure the actual plot is quite good, it has great reviews, but just not for everyone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book keeps you on your toes and keeps you guessing such a great book about overcoming tragedy i will be reading this book again
0062238868|4.0|It was a great read...really enjoyed it.  I have a deep appreciation for our special forces; especially the Navy Seals.  Chris Kyle is a true patriot that will be sorely missed.  The nation needs 500 Chris Kyles.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app, i love it.  Its like your actully taking care of a real horse.  But I can also say that if you have a big screen that its much better on that.
B0026I4EU6|5.0|Every high school aged kid in America should read this book.  This is a true story of a hero that was fortunate enough to survive a tragic event and tell the story of his friends (also heroes) who did not live to tell their story.  It is a heartbreaker...be warned.  My son has also read it and loved it as well.  We should all appreciate our armed forces more; this book will open your eyes to the sacrifices made daily in your behalf.  Buy it and read it!  You will not be disappointed.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is addicting, the search for things are hidden very well, I get stumped sometimes in searching for the items. Graphics are very good!! I love these games. Keep them coming  Great job.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|I bought this to show to my teenage son who will be in high school next year.  I believe that all teenage kids shoud see this movie for the history of what happened and to have a better appreciaton for our men and women in uniform who protect our freedoms.  You will not regret this purchase.  God bless America.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I have been looking forward to getting this album since he won last season.  He did not disappointing.  I feel like this artist has staying power.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is super fun and relaxing... yet it still remains challenging. I love the music and graphics. Very nice!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Really good description of the operation.  No bias or politics and a good view of how this was the pinnacle operation for the team.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Without giving anything away, it is fair to say that this Wool is unique. It is a fresh and new take on post-apocalyptic science fiction. I especially enjoyed how the story progresses with different characters, each human, engaging and believable.
0316010669|3.0|The information was good,but I was looking for more &#34;scientific&#34; findings than background on the science used.<br />Did order other Gladwell books because of it.
B0084HJE0S|5.0|A good book introducing the relationship between html5 and JavaScript. Javascript will continue to be an of integral part of the web
B000I0QK74|2.0|I am a big James Taylor fan. I've seen him perform live many times and have a few of his albums. But this XMas CD just doesn't cut it.
B003XMXZCW|4.0|Both versions of the movie are great.  My problem with this disc is the way the movie version selection process works.  When I put a disc like this in the player, I expect to see something that allows me to select which version I want to watch now.  I expect to see the 2 titles and a method for me to select one.  Instead, a loop of a scene from the movie plays in the background.  At at the bottom, several phrases appear any of which I can select and the only thing that is close to what I want is &#34;watch movie now&#34; or words to that effect.  When I do that, nothing happens, or so it seems.  After a call to Lionsgate to complain, I discovered that the movie titles do appear, but they are small and in white letters.  If I select &#34;watch movie now&#34; when the white smoke or fog is in the background (as I did), the titles are very hard to see.  Since I had given up on being able to select which movie when I selected &#34;watch movie now&#34;, I was not searching for movie titles to appear, I was expecting one of the movies to play.  To be logical, the phrase &#34;watch movie now&#34; should be &#34;select which movie&#34;.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|First, I saw the concert live when James and Carole came to Pittsburgh. And now I have the CD & DVD to relive those great memories of a wonderful show.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This tale held my attention right till the end; a fascinating read.  Kate Morton doesn't give anything away, maintaining the tension with her masterful characterization and control of the plot.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|love it, have seen every episode several times, and really enjoy the music as well, hope it keeps going on
0345803493|5.0|I thought I was a fast reader, but I couldn't read fast enough. An amazing story that kept me in suspense as I turned each page. E.L. James' unique style of writing certainly captivated me, as I'm sure it did to many other readers. I will definitely purchase the trilogy which I'm sure will keep me up way past my bedtime. Thank you E.L. James for a great and entertaining read.
B00AEJVXC6|1.0|The drive arrived in a non-functioning state.  The first time it was turned on it sounded like it was grinding its internals into plastic dust.  I tried inserting a CD and the sound was even worse.  There's obviously something seriously wrong with the drive mechanism.  I've filed a return with this vendor and I'll update this review with the status of the return.  This particular Plexstor drive model is really decent and I'd intended to use it for audio CD ripping.
0345803485|5.0|A story that I consider better than a bestseller. The turns and twists keep  you in awe. Full of surprises, suspense and innovative turn of events. A writer who knows how to capture your attention. I could not put this book down and lost many hours of my beauty sleep reading it, It was well worth it. I'm looking forward to book two and three.  Thank you E.L. James for your excellent story and for  entertaining me.
B00A6RVRXG|5.0|Anything by Yo La Tengo is good.  Delivered on time.  Good quality and sound.  I would recommend this. Usually anything related to music seems to be delivered on time and works fine.  Nice CD.
0345803507|5.0|At first I found myself not getting into the trilogy, but continued reading only to find my fingers turning the pages as fast as I could read, again!  The turns and twists kept me in awe wondering what to expect next. The suspense was thrilling and the ending is more than I expected. A must read!
B00A8LRIEW|5.0|Anything by New Order is good.  This CD was the completion of Waiting For The Sirens Call.  Good quality sound and delivered on time.  If you like New Order I would purchase this CD.  The price was reasonable, and it was shipped and packed carefully.  Usually any music item seems to be delivered with no issues.  Nice sound, good music, and more quality stuff by New Order.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|I thought that this game would be fun.  However, from the very first I found that it responded sluggishly.  At first I thought that it was just a learning curve sort of thing.  This proved not to be the case.  During my third time playing it the game just stopped.  This would have been bad enough in itself but it totally shut down the functions on my Toshiba Excite 7.7 tablet.  This finally necessitated a hard shutdown of the machine followed by a forced reboot.  Conequently, after getting the tablet back up and running I uninstalled the game.
B007REV4YI|4.0|To give the reader some perspective, I never understood everyone's love affair with the first Daniel Craig Bond movie and the second one was a disaster.  Skyfall is a return to the Bond movies we know and love and consider it to be much better than the previous two.  Three and a half stars.<br /><br />Spoiler alert.<br /><br />Despite the unrealistic conclusion to the the opening sequence (where the agent only shoots Bond but doesn't take another shot at the evildoer) and the overly long climax (is there an editor in the house?), this Bond movie was very enjoyable.  The opening credit sequence was extraordinary, well orchestrated with the song by Adele.  I'm glad they continue that tradition.  It could have had a few more gadgets and a tighter script and pace, but that's Hollywood these days!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This is one of those albums you have to listen to over and over and on loud to let it sink in just how great all the songs are. This is not the pop EDM autotuned throw away music that is permeating radio today. This is music that years from now will still sound fabulous. In my opinion this is, by far, Timberlakes best album to date.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Read many reviews with a lot of criticism about it not being historically and politically correct.  And this is true in part.  But it's a movie and it's entertaining and I think you can put 2 + 2 together and figure out why there would be a need for discrepancies.  I would recommend viewing it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thank if you need something to do thin this is your game but if you are under 5 this is not your game
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|What the Heck? Did not enjoy the movie and after a while I was hoping for a bomb to take out my TV, myself included if neccessary. What was that? Hated it!!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Great but could use a thesaurus helps a lot with homework for English.thanks for helping though.sincerely Kasey Mata good bye
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I finally got Modern Combat 4 to install and I love it. I do not know what the problem was, but it was worth the wait. Thank you Game Loft and thank you Amazon!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like this book because it didn't waste my time like my games do. I would like it if you guys could sell more of his books. And my kids like it to. They even think it's funny humour!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much!!! it.is completely awesome! I don't get what other people r saying.about updated.on their kindle.I get up dates mostly every time so DONT LISTEN to them other wise GET THIS GAME!!!!! IT IS WORTH IT!!!
0385349947|4.0|I have looked at other reviews of the book and I think people are missing the point, or are falling into the very trap that the book highlights.  Her background and circumstances while above average did not protect her from the gender biases that occur in business or business like settings.  I didn't have nearly the same education, I come from a blue collar family and have the additional issue of being overweight.  As a woman I do feel I had to try harder to fight my own statements about being successful in the workforce, or even in volunteer leadership roles.  I too have made the statement, what if they find out I am not nearly good enough for the position I hold.  She is trying to get us to change the statements in our heads - and the statements that get voiced in the work place.  While I agree she isn't really expressing a new message, the message is clear and easy to understand.  I get it, I got where I am, a high position at an investment bank, by leaning in and not backing away from hard choices, but I also had to learn the hard way when to say no.  I think this book is as relevant today as it was when I started my career 31 years ago because it reminds both men and women gender bias still exists.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Love the book!!!!!!!!! This is my favorite book this it is so cool you will like it so you should read it!!!!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I have watched this twice. I will watch it again. Just for a reminder of why I do not want to eat meat from commercial slaughter houses or chicken from the \\"big\\" names. Americans need to wake up to where their food is coming from. It's a shame that it is more expensive to eat healthy than to eat poorly. This movie is a good documentary to start with.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Thought this movie was excellent; very well written, directed, and acted.  John Goodman and Alan Arkin were my favorite, but Ben was a close second.  The scene on the airport runway was a bit much, but it didn't detract from the overall quality of the movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.  I only rented the movie via Amazon Instant Video, I didn't purchase it.  Segue... I've been very pleased with Amazon Instant Video.  I have an Amazon Prime account so I watch a lot of TV shows and movies for free, but I think the $4.99 to $5.99 I pay for movie rentals is more than fair.  I normally stream through my TV, but occasionally I stream movies on my iPad.  Every once in a while I have a problem with bandwidth but that may be more of an issue with Comcast Xfinity that with Amazon.  If you're thinking about renting movies from Amazon, I recommend it.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I own the DVD (double disk) version of this concert and it is one of the best concert disks I've ever seen (and heard). I would search from time to time to see if there was a Blu-ray version, and then one day - here it was! So now after watching (and listening) to both in my designated Home Theater room I can say that it was well worth buying it twice. The video quality is sharper and more vivid (on the Blu-ray version). The audio mix was incredible on the DVD so if this is better - it's not by much (still not 7.1, but the 5.1 mix is top notch).<br />This is the single best concert disk I own - the audio mix is second to NONE - even at 5.1!<br />If you are even a casual Eagles fan - this is a must own!
B001NLKZZ0|5.0|The author has been there and done that starting off as a 90 plus golfer and getting to below 70 in the time to wirte the book.  The book enables the reader to pick and choose various inner game exercises and to develop his/her own to focus and turn off the doubts created by Self 1.  I will keep this book on my Kindle for a long time.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Does anybody really like the Ultraviolet service?  The combo packs were so much better when they came with true digital downloads.  I use iTunes and have all my movies there...now I have to have a different desktop software to download and watch movies, and I can't use Apple TV to watch them.  Makes everything harder.  I'd rather buy the movie from iTunes than the disk if it comes with Ultraviolet.
B009NET0H8|3.0|Great photos, great photographer, questionable editor and publisher....<br />The images are so small that they do not fill the iPad mini's screen.

030758836X|2.0|This novel moves along seamlessly and provokes the reader to turn page after page as the mystery unravels.  Unfortunately, it fails miserably to provide the reader with a satisfying ending...author took the easy way out.  Made the read seem like a waste of time.

B004BLDD9Y|5.0|Bought this with a motion light and it works great. It puts out a very consistant bright light with no flicker at all. It's light is very white so it seems to put out more light the it says on the box as it says it the equivilant output of a fifty watt bulb. It seems brighter and whiter. I love it.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I REALLY wanted to enjoy this book, I really did but the characters just did things that make no sense at all. What army would send a new recruit out into the front lines after literally less than a week of training? Especially when they're the youngest recruits by far? While the entire court has seen what Thor can do they continually ignore his warnings about everything. As I said, I really wanted to like the book but the characters and they're random, nonsensical acts just ruined it.

B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Ok, I have had this app for about a month since it was the faotd. It has quickly become my favorite app. My projector at home and the big screen at work both have xbox's hooked up to them so I use this app to watch movies on my phone on those devices. I call this a top 10 app because they have some work to do to make it more stable, but once it is, it is a top 5 app. My desktop computer is becoming more and more useless everyday and this app just drove a huge nail in it's coffin. I wish I didn't get this for free because I would like my money to have helped them develop this better.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Awesome book.  A little slow (too descriptive) in the beginning, but once you get into the story it is riveting!<br />Great read

0887431453|3.0|These were good, but a little too easy for even my 3 year old.  He needed a bit more challenge, but the kindergarten one seems to jump quite a bit. I wish it started easy and got harder, but its really the same level throughout the book.

086571701X|5.0|This book made we want to run to rural king and get started.  But logistically it brought me down from thinking I was ready to order some fish, to a very good look at what can actually go wrong and the true cost of owning the system.  I totally still want to make one, but I am going to wait until I can gather the perfect parts from the beginning, instead of hodge podging it together.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to look further into the aquaponics before diving in.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to pick up this game for free as a deal of the day. Very entertaining and challenging too. The graphics are beautiful. Take this magical trip you won't be dissappointed!
B004XUMMFE|4.0|The space western is a genre that gets very little attention outside of anime. So its great to see a live action series that nails it perfectly. The show's various settings and situations really give a sense of remoteness and lawlessness. It truly feels like the &#34;final frontier&#34;.<br /><br />The characters and acting leave a little to be desired, but it doesn't take away from the overall experience.

B003RRY60S|3.0|I've been really disappointed in the books written about Doctor Who that I have read so far. They don't seem to have the pizzazz as the TV show has and the storylines seem to be geared more towards young teens rather than adults. Maybe I'm asking too much since I really love the tv series, but I'm still holding out for that one great Doctor Who book that I have yet to read. Anyway, it was an ok story and David Tennant looks good in my imagination no matter what the scenario! :)
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This is the kind of CD that really shows you that age has nothing to do with talent. It's a surprising blend of new & old sound that Bowie is famous for. Don't judge the CD by the pre-released video &#34;Where Are We Now?&#34; This is Bowie the way he should sound, New and Rockin'!
B00746O3X8|4.0|I do a lot of hiking and always hated having my camera bounce all over the place.  I used this with a t2i and bulky 28-300mm lens and it reduced the strain on my neck and the movement of the camera.  Haven't used the second holster, but the primary seems to work good.  Seems to be lightweight as well.  This doesnt fit me 100% as I am fairly skinny and lengthy (5'11&#34;, 135lbs), but I feel it fits good enough to do the job, especially for the $$$.

B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Darlene Zschech is one of those artists that I don't think I'm familiar with and then I start reading her bio and listening to her music and realize I am very familiar with her! She wrote Shout to the Lord which is one of worship songs we sing in church all the time along with millions of others all over the world. Revealing Jesus is a live worship CD and she also wrote a companion devotional.<br /><br />I think that live worship CD's always have an additional energy to them that really make you feel more a part of the worship experience as a whole. It's almost like you are there with her and all of those people. You can just feel the power of the presence of the Lord in that room.<br /><br />Some of the songs like In Jesus Name are really fun and high energy and some like Victor's Crown are slow and moving. All of them have in common that they are scripture breathed and full of honor, truth and worship.<br /><br />When I read that she was one of the worship leaders at Hillsong I half expected her music to sound exactly like a Hillsong CD but she really does have a style and sound all her own that sets her apart as a solo artist.<br /><br />Revealing Jesus is an awesome worship experience and the depth of Darlene's faith is evident in her lyrics.

B002SS8S7E|4.0|Batman Begins is a moody, gritty, wonderfully flavorful, yet muddled origin story of the Dark Knight, Batman.  Christopher Nolan successfully creates a mostly believable world for Gotham City to inhabit, standing apart from other cinematic adaptations of the source material, yet not so far apart as to rub fans the wrong way.  The movie is careful to position this Gotham City and this Batman as belonging almost to the same world we inhabit, though with the addition of some ridiculously precarious elevated monorails.  The film succeeds in taking us through Batman's evolution from angry, driven young man into caped crusader beginning a war on crime.  The fledgling relationship between Batman and Jim Gordon is effective, the loyalty between Bruce and Alfred is touching.  Philosophically, though, the film flounders.<br /><br />The film grapples with the theme of fear, sometimes effectively and other times clumsily.  Of particular curiosity is that Batman wants to be both a symbol of hope, but also a symbol that strikes fear into the hearts of criminals.  Batman also consistently seems to believe that criminals are somehow fundamentally different than law-abiding citizens, though he stumbles through some explanation about how stealing to prevent starving gave him some sympathy... without going as far as to say he identified with people who might do so.  He fails to note that vigilantism is a crime, and therefore, technically speaking, Batman himself IS a criminal.  He also fails to consider that among the lower income citizenship of Gotham, a family might have a son or uncle or mother or father who resorts to crime.  Should Batman strike fear into that family member's heart, he will not inspire hope in the hearts of the remainder of the family.  Batman seems to have a very black and white view of the world -- which is fine for Batman, but the film fails to present a different voice.  This is the largest failing of the film.<br /><br />Since the movie attempts to position the Batman story in a more realistic context, it should position Batman himself -- a morose, disturbed, costume-donning vigilante billionaire -- in the same context, as a complex, unbalanced, individual, rather than simple &#34;the protagonist.&#34;  The movie seems to share Batman's moral compass, which, given how unstable the guy is, seems dubious at best.<br /><br />Another point, far too much is made of Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne's father.  Multiple flashback sequences present the guy as a saint, a perfect, magnanimous caring, giving, charitable billionaire.  At the same time, Martha Wayne, Bruce's mother is a non-entity.  She has perhaps a single line, which has no lasting meaning.  Perhaps Bruce Wayne had a cold and distant mother, but since this doesn't seem to be an important part of Batman's profile, why present her as only window dressing to Thomas Wayne.  I know why, because this movie is essentially a sausage party.  While Rachel Dawes serves as an important grounding force for Bruce Wayne, she also serves as damsel in distress, with one of the more noteworthy action set-pieces being designed entirely around saving her.  So.<br /><br />None the less, the film is still a thrilling adventure that makes you believe a depressed angry billionaire orphan could become a bat.  And it's realized so effectively that even as you squirm at the muddled socio-political implications, you can't help but enjoy the ride.  So, four stars, in spite of myself.the Batman story in a more realistic context, it should position Batman himself -- a morose, disturbed, costume-donning vigilante billionaire -- in the same context, as a complex, unbalanced, individual, rather than simple &#34;the protagonist.&#34;  The movie seems to share Batman's moral compass, which, given how unstable the guy is, seems dubious at best.<br /><br />Another point, far too much is made of Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne's father.

0871404133|4.0|The book is about the rise of social organisms on the planet and how they have come to dominate their ecosystems. Wilson uses ants and humans as his main examples of the success of sociality.<br /><br />It's aiming to be a popular book. There are, in fact, a few scientific references in the book, but if you're not careful, you won't find them until you get to the very end - where they are clustered together in a list.<br /><br />The first 100 pages of the book is a history of the rise of humans. Alas, I'm one of those who often finds histories boring, so I had to push a bit through this section of the book. Then there's thirty pages on social insects. Then there's sixty pages on the theories of social evolution. This is really where Wilson comes unstuck.<br /><br />Wilson launches into a misguided attack on kin selection theory. Obviously, Wilson has some understanding of kin selection. However, he doesn't have a sympathetic understanding of it, and instead seeks to destroy and discredit it. Alas, in order to do this, he has to set up a series of straw men and then vigorously attack them. This might be entertaining for some - but Wilson is a popular author, and here we run the risk of an eminent scientist confusing and misleading the next generation of students. About the best that can be said for Wilson's attack on kin selection is that it is embarrassing and half-baked. I noticed that, as if to illustrate that he doesn't really know what he is talking about, Wilson gives an incorrect definition of inclusive fitness, saying:<br /><br />  \\"The inclusive fitness of the individual is its personal fitness, in other words the number of its personal offspring who grow up and have children of their own added to the effect its actions will have on the fitness of its collateral relatives, such as siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins.\\"<br /><br />That definition is wrong. Those familiar with the topic will recognize that it's only two thirds of the correct definition. Wilson goes on to discuss the claimed equivalence of kin and group selection. He says:<br /><br />  \\"Further there are mathematical difficulties with the definition of r, the degree of relatedness. These difficulties render incorrect the oft-repeated claim that group selection is the same as kin selection expressed through inclusive fitness.\\"<br /><br />After supposedly demolishing the decades of work by kin selection theorists, Wilson goes on to present his preferred alternative theory of social evolution - which is based on group selection and the idea of group-forming forces - where Wilson gives a \\"defensible nest\\" as his main example of the latter.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Wilson's book is probably exhibit number one when it comes to showing how group selection leads to confusion about evolutionary theory. Wilson is evidently in a hopeless muddle about kin selection and group selection. It seems hard to avoid the conclusion that group selection lies at the root of the problem. While Wilson might have been trying to help the cause of group selection in his book, it seems more likely that it will be an embarrassment for group selection's proponents.<br /><br />Group selection's main problem that it faces a well-armed opponent. Kin selection explains all the same things that group selection explains - and has been scientific orthodoxy for decades. Most modern group selection enthusiasts seem to have finally agreed that group selection makes no predictions not also made by kin selection. The main case for group selection these days seems to amount to the idea that it represents a stimulating alternative perspective. High-level selection can be a form of holism to counter kin selection's reductionism. Group selection models can be tractable in some cases where lower-level kin selection models are not. This is all reasonable: group selection does have a positive side. The problem with group selection is that historically its use has often led to junk science. People tend to invoke benefits to group willy-nilly - without doing the math, or even sanity-checking their explanations. To many scientists, group selection explanations thus often look like a poor substitute for actually understanding what is going on. Many explanations based on group selection, on closer examination, have turned out to be wrong or misleading. In the cases group selection is useful, kin selection is often more useful. SO, group selection has its merits - but needs a health warning.<br /><br />Wilson claims that humans are a eusocial species - even though we mostly lack one of the primary traits associated with eusociality - namely reproductive division of labour. Wilson doesn't explain that his use of the term is unorthodox and controversial.<br /><br />Wilson's examples of eusociality are all from animals. He lists beetles, aphids, thrips, shrimps, mole rats and humans. However there are other examples of social behaviour among microbes, plants and fungi. In particular multicellularity is a common form of eusociality. The examples of its evolution illuminate the topic of social evolution. However, Wilson makes no use of these examples.<br /><br />Wilson attempts to apply the study of animal social evolution to humans - and this leads him to the kin selection (or group selection) axis. While important, this leads to a pretty myopic perspective on human social behaviour, which is heavily influenced by reciprocity, reputations, byproduct mutualism - and manipulation of humans by memes. You can't really coherently discuss human social evolution without casting your net wider than this.<br /><br />Lastly, the book ends up with a review of cultural evolution in humans. In the 1980s Wilson was a pioneer in applying biology to human culturally-transmitted behaviour, writing two books on this topic. Wilson at least understands that culture evolves - and that memes coevolve with genes. However, his older books promoted a pre-memetics perspective, in which everything boiled down to DNA genes. Checking to see if Wilson had moved on 40 years later, I was surprised to find that little had changed. He cited his old work, and trotted out much the same theory that he advocated back in the 1980s. This idea has been totally superseded in the mean time by the application of Darwinian evolutionary theory directly to cultural variation - along the lines pioneered by Richard Dawkins in 1976. Wilson's discussion of this work is confined to one paragraph. He chastises the researchers involved for paying insufficient attention to the interactions between genes and memes - and then launches into a laundry list of such interactions.<br /><br />This hopeless treatment of cultural evolution might not matter - but this is one of the few books addressing the topic that I regularly see in bookshops. This might be the first exposure to the topic for many. A teaching opportunity has been squandered, because Wilson is stuck back in the 1970s on the topic and has failed to grok most of the more recent literature.<br /><br />In the book, Wilson expands on his old claim that genes keep memes on a leash by presenting an argument against the possibility of a memetic takeover. He says:<br /><br />  \\"I am further inclined to discount the widespread belief that robotic intelligence will overtake and potentially replace human intelligence.\\"<br /><br />What are Wilson's reasons? He goes on to give them, saying:<br /><br />  \\"To advance from robot to human would be a task of immense technological difficulty. But why should we even wish to try? Even after our machines far exceed our outer mental capacities, they will not have anything resembling human minds. In any case, we do not need such robots, and we will not want them. The biological human mind is our province.\\"<br /><br />Wilson's objection seems simple-minded to me. He gives me no reason to think that he knows much about machine intelligence or futurism. He's just a famous biologist speculating on something about which he knows little. The idea that people will lack motivation to build superhuman intelligent machines just seems daft to me. The motivation is obvious.<br /><br />So: this is not a good book. It is quite readable, but it's full of outdated or wrong science. Readers should be warned that, while Wilson speaks authoritatively, he doesn't really know what he's talking about in many places.iled down to DNA genes.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I bought each book one at a time thinking I wasn't going to &#34;need&#34; to read all of them...but you do. It's a guilty pleasure and a fun read. Gets increasingly more sentimental and emotional but it is a girl book after all.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Massive model, huge amount of fun for young and old !  Good value for money considering the amount of mini figs included.<br />Highly recommended!
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album is great gets everyone going and then brings up some important issues of todays society. Highly recommend this album.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I attemped to download this app. I did, but it continued to install all night. It was plugged in but it drained my battery anyway as it continued to try to install all night. POS
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book it's my new favorite book set aside so b it. I can't wait to read the full serice
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I don't like angry birds, but I love star wars and seeing clones as pigs? Oh yes. This game made me a believer.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Not having tried it yet, I can't speak to its effectiveness.  However, it seems to make sense.  It is flexible enough to be incorporated into any lifestyle. No calorie counting, no guilt, and no deprivation. Not many diets can say that. Even though I've lost about 30 lbs on a traditional diet, I'm stuck and need to lose another 20. I'm going to give this method of eating a chance and see what happens.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works just like the desktop version does. Absolutely wonderful. You can download anything online and open it there, you can delete the file, Mark the file up with notes, etc. Love it.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|This book was very well written and I enjoyed each page. Would recommend reading this novel as alot of people could and I am sure would relate to the story.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Most definitely not the best out there, not even close. You're probably thinking &#34;solitare is solitare&#34; but NO. Just skip this one and move on.
B007REV4YI|4.0|This is very Good. At least it gives more of the background to the legend that is James Bond..Highly recommended film.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|No, you can't have multiple pages up but that shouldn't be a big deal...the only reason you need to have multiple pages is for a research project and you shouldn't be doing your homework last minute on your mobile. I love having wiki right at my fingertips because my boyfriend and I often disagree on a lot of stuff (\\"Look at that! It's the ranger from LOTR!\\" \\"No, it's not.\\" \\"Yes, it totally is. Look at that guy and tell me that's not him\\" \\"You're blind, put your glasses on\\" \\"They are on\\" \\"Well you're still blind, look it up.\\" and straight to wiki I went. I'm the one who thought it was the ranger, and I was wrong). Conversations like this are daily, and I'm glad to have wiki right next to me on my kindle.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|This is excellent, it follows closely to the books. I hope the rest of the series is as good as this
B005HSL626|5.0|When I first saw this (on a iPad commercial) I thought it looked silly. I was so right, right but it is awesomely silly and addicting. It even has challenges! It's awesome.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Very light reading, totally unrealistic scenario, but it was fun to read from a pure fantasy standpoint. Could pass for youth fiction, so if you're looking for something deeper or more meaningful in your adult life, this is not going to do it. The mystical threads were left hanging, and instead it focused on the heavy reality of the main character trying to survive in the world. I can't really recommend it except that if it happens to come your way and you're looking for something to pass the time, it's readable and entertaining. I needed something light for a long day of travel, and this worked out fine, keeping my attention but easy to pick up and put down.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|I order for my little sun. I get in time , quickly and everything. Just perfect. If I will be need some LEGO item I will order again.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read this in about three hours. It takes a heavy topic and manages to convey it in a realistic but entertaining manner. It was more realistic and deep than the movie, although it used a very convenient device (writing letters to explain feelings) to wrap things up a bit too neatly. I did enjoy reading it but it was pretty lightweight as far as literature goes. If you're looking for a quick and engaging read this is a good choice.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love the show, BUT,  what I love the most is that I am able to watch it right now in Argentina, no problems at all, I love Amazon and always will. One more time, thank you!
B005BY3XHC|5.0|This book was required for a class on prosperity. I've read it before but never took the time to really absorb the teaching. Because of the pace of the class, I took my time, integrating each Law into my daily practice. This makes such a difference. My life outlook is changed. Very grateful!
B0042816YK|3.0|She got it for the scenery more than the story.  Personally (In my opinion ONLY), it seems like a stupid story about a tramp taking a world tour and having a guy in every port.  The whole &#34;finding myself&#34; BS is lame too.  Like I said, just my take.  Opinions vary.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good continuation. Wish they would go on with the book and make a full series of Fifty Shade. Need more!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|If you are buying it you probably already saw it and want your own to watch whenever.  That's me.  It was really a good film.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Took  me a few chapters to get into the story. But once I did, I was hooked! Couldn't tear myself away. Loved it!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|My wife really liked it and ordered it for her mom and my step-mom.  It's alright,  better if you are of the female persuasion.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|The first time I listened to this album, I did not think it made as great as an impact of Bruno Mars's previous albums. However, after a second listen, I started to fall in love. Gorilla is my favorite song.
B00005614N|5.0|This CD is seriously good.  Do NOT dismiss it when considering the next addition to your collection.  If you're a tech geek you'll hear a bit of the conversion process to modern media, but that disappears quickly into the performances.  This product is a solid winner.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I prefer watching this program on my Kindle Fire than on broadcast television. I prefer the originial UK version. Thanks for making this available to your Prime members. I love this membership and tell all I know about the benefits of your Prime Membership.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|would like more control over themes. and the icon is kind of hideous, but the app itself more than makes up for it
1416575464|5.0|Its everything you can ask about decorating if you are beginning to be interested in the small details that take you towards a home you'd be proud to show anyone! I read the book within a couple of hours after receiving it and filled it will stickies to remind me of things I have to keep in mind once i move into my new apartment! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking into the subject. Yes many things you can eventually bump into online completely free but i appreciate books, and the fact that everything is in one place.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the graphics, the challenges. It's so much fun! What else can i say about, I just love it!
B00AA8Q0FQ|4.0|We love the Monster High storylines, and this double feature didn't disappoint! As a personal preference, we wish the CGI renderings were a little more similar to the look and feel of the look and feel of the original web series. But, none the less, these movies look great!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a nice match 3 game. One of the better free apps of the day. I certanly would recommend it if you like match 3 games.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I'd heard the song &#34;Lights&#34; and wanted to find out who sung it. I bought the MP3 and listen to it very frequently.
B000W4RFHK|5.0|After Jack Kerouac's \\"On The Road\\" exploded upon the minds of the nineteen fifties youth, the spontaneous, wandering philosophy, combined with jazz and drug induced visions became the bel esprit, the beau ideal, the pulsating throb that beckoned, wandererlust with the sole goal, a blissful, beatific way of life.<br />The paganism of San Francisco's Bohemia enticed with siren voice, many away from homes, touting marathon drinking bouts, free love, drug experimentation, and wild poetry jam sessions. All believed they were, \\"on the road to Heaven.\\"<br />Japhy Ryder aka Gary Snyder, was the number one Dharma Bum, a spiritual model. Ryder and Smith were eager to climb the Matterhorn, enjoy a Happiness Conference deep in the Sierra wilderness, or learn about yalyum from a naked woman, a Bodhisattva, who desired to be a holy concubine in a ritual cave. They wanted true,sweet sleep, meditation, and intense silence.<br />The trail had an immortal look, the lake below, a toy, the fallen snag made a perfect bridge. The ferry and a cold drizzle displayed Puget Sound,the Northwest,<br />Mount Baker, and the Port of Seattle. The Hotel Stevens had a clean skid row room for a dollar seventy five. First Avenue had a Goodwill Store, wool socks, and bandanas. Smith was headed for a week at Fire School. He'd hike the Skagit River in a wonderland of emptiness of the golden eternity. Alone on Desolation Peak, he found the Great Truth Cloud, Dharmamega, the ultimate goal.<br />Kerouac sought inner peace. Not so much to explain the way of the world, nor to understand it, but to accept life as it came, and to appreciate the raindrop in the illimitable ocean which is awakenerhood. Another James Joyce, creating new words to accept, or not. The Dharma Bums has a swing, a feeling for nature, and enough self-doubting for all readers. It had been ten years since I bought and read Kerouac. Rediscovery hides around every corner.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I think it is a great album, it is a more mature sound, that feels honest to me. I can listen all the way through with no skipping.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Great choice for the free app of the day. It is so addictive that I can not put it down. Definitely worth recommend to others
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|I bought this album mainly for the fact that my daughter loves the &#34;lazy song&#34;. I listened to it with her and really dug a lot of the other songs on there. It's pretty dope.
159514188X|5.0|I loved the back and forth narrative between the tragic victim and the boy who is desperately trying to<br />track her ending.  It is a deeply moving and very relevant story of teenage love and need for acceptance.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Love this movie, I love cars and I loved these movies but I never had established my collection and I truly believe in buying used movies, no need to pay full price. Thanks, movie was in great condition.

B006886962|5.0|This is a great show showing, with realism, the 1st Recon Battalion's deployment in Iraq. The actors are great, there is no unnecessary addition of music here, so it feels like a documentary. I would love to see Amazon add CC or subtitles because I'm sure the blu-ray version has it. I bought the whole series here, and I would expect to see at least CC.

B00BETX5PS|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie as a rental. Great picture quality, although the sound tended to change in volume between background noise and character talking, which was annoying, but may be more an issue with the PS3 as it does the same at times through Netflix.<br /><br />Only gripe with the Amazon system is that you can't rent a movie, and then apply that fee towards purchasing it permanently. If Amazon allowed this, I'm willing to bet digital movie sales would increase.

B009YQJ322|5.0|I saw this movie in 3-D when it came out in theaters and when you watch Karl Urban become the law with the futuristic special effects in 3-D this movie is great! If you're a Dredd fan I recommend that you give this movie a try.
0316113077|5.0|I haven't tried any of the cakes in the book yet but I am looking forward to getting started.  Everything looks easy to follow which is good to a novice baker like myself.  I am glad that I purchased this book.
B000FBJG04|4.0|I read this book in 4 days; not because I wanted to, but because I had to. But heck, it was a pleasure reading it and I had not much difficulty doing so. The author has a unique style of telling, he kept my interest and kept me hooked through out the story. By the end, I found myself feeling like I had gone through the war with Easy Company! Loved it and would definitely recommend it. By the way, im a 17 year old who doesn't enjoy reading too much...

Now I'm waiting to test blood at dr. to see if my cholestrol has dropped!!!  Thank you!!!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I give this book a 5 star review because it is truly a story that opens your eyes to what you and others think and feel and it helps put some of you thoughts and feelings into words when you can't explain it. I would recommend it to anyone but I would most recommend it for a teens who may be unsure of who they are. I myself wonder who I am everyday and The Perks Of Being A Wallflower has become my favorite book.
B001PPLKI0|5.0|I bought this 66 song collection for one 2 minute song in particular that I wasn't able to find anywhere else, but was delighted to find the entire collection just as delightful and enjoyable.  This is Elvis at his best and seemingly most natural.
0792164903|4.0|Tim Burton's 1999 gothic horror film Sleepy Hollow, loosely based on Washington Irving's classic short story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, is a cinematic gem. While it does have minor flaws which become more noticeable towards the end, overall it is an extremely well-made, well-acted, creepy but darkly funny film. It stars Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, only in this adaptation, instead of being a schoolmaster from Connecticut he is a police constable from New York City who is angered and irritated at the medieval methods of punishment and conviction doled out by the courts in his native city. At the beginning of the film he is informed of a string of serial murders being committed in a small upstate New York village called Sleepy Hollow. He is sent there by a judge played by Sir Christopher Lee and upon arrival finds out from several of the elders of the village that they believe that it is not a mortal man who is responsible for the slayings but an undead headless horseman who was originally a brutal Hessian mercenary beheaded by his own sword during the Revolutionary War. They believe he has come back from hell to find his missing head, which is why all of the victims are found headless, with there heads nowhere to be found. Equals parts Mystery, Drama, Suspense, Horror, and Fantasy, Sleepy Hollow, is in my opinion, far better than the story that inspired it. Although the story is good in it's own right, the Burton film is far more engaging and suspenseful, due to it's multiple plot twists and eerie, gothic atmosphere. My favorite thing about the film, as a matter of fact, is the setting and atmosphere, which is incredibly dark and brooding with numerous shots of misty autumn forests of gnarled old trees, gray leaden skies, and old fashioned gothic architecture. The second best thing are the characters themselves and the dialogue, both of which are incredibly charming and old-fashioned. In addition to Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane the film stars Christina Ricci as Katrina Van Tassel, Marc Pickering as Young Masbath, Miranda Richardson as Lady Van Tassel, Michael Gambon as Baltus Van Tassel, and in an out of character role, Christopher Walken as The Horseman! I thoroughly enjoyed Sleepy Hollow, and this film is without a doubt my favorite Tim Burton film!trina Van Tassel, Marc Pickering as Young Masbath, Miranda Richardson as Lady Van Tassel, Michael Gambon as Baltus Van Tassel, and in an out of character role, Christopher Walken as The Horseman! I thoroughly enjoyed Sleepy Hollow, and this film is without a doubt my favorite Tim Burton film!
B003VPOXAE|4.0|It took me years and years to read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  Despite its sweetness and naïvet&eacute;, I must say I'm disappointed.<br /><br />I don't think there's a lot of point writing an extensive review at this time.  I'll just say that I'd expected this to be fine literature, when it's more accurate to say it's a fine story for 14 or 15 year-olds; or rather, it would have been back when it was first published in 1960.  Because of the old rumor that it was really a Truman Capote book I expected more.  Clearly this is not a Truman Capote book, and it's difficult to see how it might be mistaken for one.  Unfortunately this novel is nothing but predictable, and worse, it's purple, with unbelievable deaths which are far too convenient for the story's credibility.<br /><br />I might point out that we barely know the black characters in this book at all.<br /><br />Almost certainly this novel tells us far more about those who made it a best-seller in the early 60s than it does about either its subject matter or about Harper Lee.  Perhaps it can be seen as playing a role in advance of the Civil Rights Movement akin to that played by UNCLE TOM'S CABIN before the Civil War.  Worth reading?  I suppose so.  A classic?  Literature?  No.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Loved it  Awesome show Second time watching it.  Can't wait for season 5.  I live in Albuquerque so great to see all the places I know

B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie would be good for even a non Bond fan. Skyfall was more serious/dark and had fewer of the classic one liners James is known for.
0802473156|5.0|Although the writing style is slightly dated, it doesn't mean that the meat of this book is without value. For anyone wishing to communicate inside their marriage and their life with logical ideas about who they are and how they relate to others - this is a great book!
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|The positives:<br />1. Beautiful.<br />2. Tiger is amazing.<br />3. Everything that happens in the ocean.<br />4. Anything that happens at night.<br />5. The use of dark skin Indians vs the usual.<br /><br />The negatives:<br />1. Too much preaching about god and religion (I don't like buying propaganda without being warned first).<br />2. Story is weak.<br />3. Not much character development.<br />4. Not sure what the point of the movie was and I could have lived perfectly fine without ever watching it.<br /><br />Don't know why some think this movie is a deep religious movie. This is as shallow and simplistic as a modern practitioner of Christianity. If the bible were made into a movie it would be the most x-rated, violent, incestual, racist, xenophobic, masochistic, chauvinist movie ever. This movie takes the idea of god and religion and turns it into a simple message of pretty covenient nothingness.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fast read. Intelligently written. The use of email in place of dialogues is clever.  I am now looking forward to part 2..

B004JZBGWI|5.0|So long to the 3 pound organizer where I kept everything relevant about my life written down in a variety of different pen colors. And good riddance to December 31st of every year when I'd have to go through the entire year of notes just so that I could transfer them into the new year's organizer! I now have everything that my organizer provided me without all the extra work and aggravation. Shopping lists, appointments, bill payments, there's no end to what Colornotes can be used for. My only complaint is that there isn't a PC version that would tie in with the phone app. That would make Colornotes absolutely perfect, especially right now when my phone has developed some problem with its screen.

B000N2HCKQ|5.0|I read this book as part of a book club with the Marketing team at work. We met weekly to discuss each chapter and were able to easily discuss ways we would incorporate the ideas into our everyday work. We also frequently found ourselves quoting the book in meetings and conversations.
B000UBMSB8|3.0|The DVD containing the Director's cut of the movie is fair, HOWEVER the enhanced quality of the movie and extras are very nice (KUDOS), if you are familiar with the original version. However the Director's cut in this set has a terrible ending and is missing Harrison Ford's narration throughout the movie as in the theatrical version which is important in understanding what is happening and why in the movie. Ideally, if I could, I would use the theaterical version with all the upgrades and extensions included in the Director's cut. In fact I wish there was a version done this way, I'd buy it and sell this one back. The movie deserves 5 stars, the upgrades are worth 5 stars, the extras are worth 5 stars, but what the director removed from his version (i.e. narration and ending) is what makes me give it an overall 3 star rating.

B00BESLHEA|5.0|Plot: Rza, after escaping slavery and shipwreck, just wants to escape with his hot chinese lover. But no! There's the emperor's gold to steal... everybody wants it, anybody can have it, except the orphans! Unstoppable kung-fu grip action with a dirty Wutang beat!<br /><br />Seriously, this movie is hilarious. Take it for what it is, and if you like Wutang, and/or black belt theater, this is great stuff.  Lucy Liu and Russel Crowe add acting chops to an otherwise nonsense script, but leave your critical mind at the door and enjoy the bloody entertaining fun. ;)

B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is really a good BASIC backpack camera bag. It really isn't big enough to hold more than one body and a few basic lenses. If you want to carry two bodies and some useful lenses, you better look into larger bag. It is rather stealthy, looking much like a middle-schooler backpack, so I really like it for that. Does well behind me on my motorcycle too.

There's some great remakes of some old standards like Goodnight Irene, All of Me, and especially Still Got The Blues,  and there are also a couple of new songs.  Clapton sings with so much feeling it almost overshines his great guitar playing.  This album is a definite keeper!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Disney. Blu-ray quality is great and it has many fun special features. Not too scary for my four year old.
B007R21JJK|5.0|Purchased this motherboard to be used with I5 3570k and 670 ftw. No issues at all. Installation was simple and the uefi performed surprisingly well.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|The blu-ray of this movie is crisp and beautiful. I love that you can see all of the hard work the animators put into this gorgeous masterpiece and it has great special features, too! Great for kids of all ages. I love the fact that they put separate subtitles for the English and Japanese versions! Finally! Great for sub and dub lovers!
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was very informative it brought confirmation of how class and nationality played a huge role during that era and how although there has been advancement in science some practices remain the same they have been modernized and commercialized more effectively but the value of the person or persons is still left in limbo.  If HeLa cells made science and health care what it is today and what it can be in the future why not recognize and compensate her children and descendants there are many ways to compensate it's not always about money quality of life.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I remember this movie. When I was little kid and watch this. It reallly good movie. For while, thought about it and buy it. I really enjoy it to watching it. Part favorite scene is Cher and Rocky singing &#34;LIttle Egypt&#34;

0062082353|5.0|I loved this book. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. Mind you the weapon description was over my head being a woman. Other than that it opened my eyes to the military world. Confermed my doubts about the government also.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|CS Lewis once said that the best teachers are often advanced students because they have recently begun themselves. This book is a roadmap written by a young artist for those who will come after him. It contains almost everything I wish someone had told me when I was first starting out and a few things I still needed to learn ten years later. Does it give you everything you need to know to get you writing that best seller right away? No, it offers something better, wise advice to get you started on a lifetime of good work.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Great surfing movie and awesome storey about a legend in the making. if you're from Northern California you're probably already know the name, great backstory about an amazing Surfer.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|Thought this was fascinating. One's perspective and loyalties to the two main characters fluctuates continually throughout the book. Guaranteed you will want to finish the book ASAP to see how it climaxed

B007N5YIUS|5.0|Awesome app, way to go Rovio, keeps the little ones very entertained while doing boring errands. This is much appreciated!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|It is a very good movie. I watched it on redbox on valentines day and it was perfect because hotel transylvania is all about how Dracula's wife died because and angry mob kills her and the dad and the little girl/his daughter get away and so he builds a safe, hidden place for monsters in the woods. But when shes older she wants to see the outside world! So its a story about his love for his daughter and her new human boyfriend ( but thats a different story ).
B005NFJAMG|5.0|Fast delivery, good quality and sound and I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes grea entertainment and non-stop action.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The movie itself was great. If you enjoyed the first three then you will certainly love this one. The soundtrack is ask phenomenal. They did a great job of bringing back the same actors and they each delivered better than ever.

0440237688|5.0|Jonas lives in the \\"perfect\\" world. A world where the needs of the whole outweigh the needs of the few. A world where there is no reason to go to war. A world where everyone in the community has a job, a spouse, and children assigned to them. A world where \\"sameness\\" is achieved, and no one is different. When Jonas is assigned to become the new \\"Reciever of Memories\\", however, Jonas soon realizes that this \\"perfection\\" comes at a steep price.<br /><br />Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" is a truly masterful piece of Young Adult literature. It captures the readers imagination while making some very deep insight about what it means to be human. Lowry skillfully crafts her language in a way that cultivates a readers emotions. As the reader journeys into Jonas's world, they identify very quickly with this very special young man.<br /><br />This Newberry Award winner is suitable for most children twelve and up. Because of some of its sexual and violent content, the book has been banned is some districts. It is, however, very well done and could be used in most schools.
B00A17AD36|5.0|Idk what about it that caught my attention I just liked it as soon as I bought it...kind of reminds me of prince..lmao
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Very impressed with the drama and acting. Chiklis is amazing. Looking forward to watching the rest of the series and episodes.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is amazing and in just 7 days, I could see definition in my arms that hadn't been there yet. I'm only on level 1 but can already see a major difference in my body and it's only about 22 minutes long!
0425264351|2.0|I find it difficult to believe the manuscript was ever appraised by a professional editor. The success of this series must bring a glimmer of hope to every wannabe author with a half decent story but no writing talent. The plot is so full of holes that I look forward to what will certainly be many spoofs of this work. Only my masochistic nature kept me going on this dog.<br />Yet despite the unmitigated awfulness of Child's writing style, there is something in the Reacher character that makes you want to keep turning the page. Sort of like that thing you find at the back of the fridge. You know its been there for ages, is going to smell really bad, but you just have to take a sniff......
B009M588K8|4.0|This was a very good read; however, thought the publishing was less than expected.  I felt like I was back in 2nd grade reading - big type & lots of white space.  I suspect this was done to allow a higher $ sale.  Don't get me wrong - great read and interesting, but publisher gimmicked it to much!
B0025KVLRO|5.0|50 years ago, this week, PLEASE PLEASE ME was originally released to astounding public and critical acclaim.  Unfortunately, the USA would not see our first Beatles album for almost a year, and of course it has been drilled extensively, until there are no more places to find for drilling, in the endless reviews on Amazon, for each and every Beatle album available today.  I doubt many will read this review, so I am taking a new tack in my headline, and in these Beatles reviews.  The history is so intensively covered and anyone with the slightest curiosity or failing memories, can pretty much look up their answers about The Beatles in about 10,000 places on the world wide web.  I keep getting nudged by readers to write Beatles album reviews in concert with my pen name, something I have avoided because of the monstrous amount of reviews already posted, and because essentially, what more is there to say?  Okay so there are billions of fans, old and new, and with any keen interest, as I indicated, you find your answers almost anywhere.  So in celebration of the 50th anniversary, let's forget that a little less than 49 years from now, on my 8th birthday, I watched The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show and fell in love with what my father called that insane yeah-yeah-yeah music.  Let's forget the personal histories and the critical histories, and the Beatles analyses and histories, and let's talk about the music!  I want to introduce the young people who have heard OF the music, who might even KNOW the music but who are replacing the lexicon of the \\"classic rock\\" idiom with \\"classical\\" idiom.  When I was kid, The Three B's were Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms.  By the time I was in college, pop culture had replaced The Three B's with Bach, Beethoven, and Beatles (a much more likely candidate anyway since Brahms was sleepy lullaby music, LOL).  Okay, so now The Fab Four have cemented their place in history and I am sure that in some not too distant future, rock and roll as we knew it, will have established itself as a cultural art form in the genre of classics.  The Beatles then will be the masters of that, no doubt, and I dare say there will not be one dissenting vote on that anywhere on the planet.<br /><br />The Beatles UK and USA catalogues were so vastly different up to Sgt Pepper's release, that I did not own this particular version of PLEASE PLEASE ME (PPM) until it was released as an import from Parlophone in my college days.  My mom was indulgent enough to buy me Beatles albums for birthdays and Christmas as a youngster so I had a nice Capitol Records collection, most of which was worn to shreds by the 70's.  The Parlophone import was a stereo version and pretty much rivals the new remastered discs (2009), more on that in a moment.  According to Mark Lewisohn, PPM was recorded on a two-track BTR tape recording machine, with most of the instrumentation on one track and the vocals on the other, allowing for a better balance between the two on the final quarter-inch tape mix-down in mono.  My 70's \\"stereo\\" release was more like \\"High Fidelity\\" which was a fancy way of saying Mono with characteristics of enveloping sound, but not true stereo!  In '88, after the release of the original UK Beatles catalogue on CD, my wife bought me the whole collection in a nice collectors \\"Breadbox\\" with a roll-top.  All of the first four albums on CD were of the same HiFi mono but I have to say the sound is spectacular and better than many stereo \\"remasters\\" of classic rock.  If you own one of the 1987-88 CD's, you might want to think twice about the 2009 remasters.  For purists, Beatlemaniacs like myself, the '88 CD catalogue is indispensable and mathematically perfect in an auditory engineering perspective.  However,  the curious (myself included), the un-initiated youth of now, might more enjoy the 2009 remasters.  Just bear in mind that previous explanation of the two-track BTR tape recording machine, with most of the instrumentation on one track and the vocals on the other, that the stereo mix was made at the same time as the mono mix, with one track on the left channel and the other on the right, as well as an added layer of reverb to better blend the two tracks together. This was common practice for playback on stereo consoles in 1963 when this album was engineered.  Listening to it in \\"stereo\\" this way is singularly unique but many of us have found it rather disconcerting.  I have only purchased this album PPM, and BEATLES FOR SALE (the fourth and last of the original Mono engineered remastered in Stereo in 2009) in this manner, and that was by mp3 because from all I had read, I was not sure I was going to like it (and still remain on the fence) and my CD's are still perfect to my ears.  No Reply on BEATLES FOR SALE seems to have gained the most from this new Stereotomy, at least by my liking, but the music is definitely enjoyable and no one should shy away from the new releases on my say so, not by any means.  However, if you are \\"new\\" to the Beatles, are a purist musicologist by any measure, and want historical accuracy in your explorations, I do urge you to seek out and find nice fresh copies of the '88 releases.<br /><br />Now, about the songs!  This review is for the young and novice Beatles explorers.  Again, will not waste time with repetition of a thousand and one historical docu-dramas on The Beatles and the history leading up to this album, that can be found ad infinitum on these pages, so let's talk about the songs.  It might fascinate one to find out that all this album was produced in what has been called a \\"marathon recording\\", at 10:00 am on Monday, 11 February 1963, the Beatles and George Martin started recording studio tracks of what was essentially their live act in 1963, and they finished 585 minutes later (9 hours and 45 minutes).  There were very few overdubs and edits used in this session so what you hear is almost what went down note for note in the studio.  Some vocal overdubs are really as much \\"editing\\" as was accomplished for this astonishing feat of music.  Lennon said of their songs during this period, that he and McCartney were just cranking out \\"pop songs with no more thought of them than that--to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant.\\"  Hence, you have simple early 60's rock and roll in its purest form.  What The Beatles brought to this continent, in their electric guitar rock, was a fresh and dynamic image of the already innate American sound of Bill Haley & The Comets, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Chuck Berry.  Listen to I Saw Her Standing There!<br /><br />I Saw Her Standing There was built like this (according to Paul) \\"Here's one example of a bit I pinched from someone: I used the bass riff from 'Talkin' About You' by Chuck Berry in 'I Saw Her Standing There'.  I played exactly the same notes as he did and it fitted our number perfectly. Even now, when I tell people, I find few of them believe me; therefore, I maintain that a bass riff hasn't got to be original\\".  The lyrics leading up to the marathon recording were a different matter, but it demonstrates the dynamo that was the Lennon-McCartney team, in their best days they did not \\"fight\\" over the collaboration, just accepted each other's ideas intrinsically.  \\"I had 'She was just seventeen,' and then 'never been a beauty queen'. When I showed it to John, he screamed with laughter, and said 'You're joking about that line, aren't you?'\\",  \\"It was one of the first times he ever went 'What? Must change that...'\\".  I Saw Her Standing There is one of the great rock and roll hits (#139 on Rolling Stones' 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time), a perfect catchy tune, great early electric guitar punch, and the best song possible to be the first track on the first album of a historic run.<br /><br />Six of the 14 tracks on the album are covers, brilliant covers, which many agree are summarily better than the original recordings!  You might be interested, if music history is your bag, to know something about these songs.<br /><br />Anna (Go To Him) was an original 1962 soul single by Arthur Alexander that fared okay, but The Beatles cover, with Lennon on emotional lead vocals received the high recognition for the song.  It has some unusual drumming and terrific hi-hats by Ringo that serve to accent the vocals perfectly.  You might remember Al Bundy in Married With Children obsessed with the tune, trying for a full episode to figure out what the song is that he is humming and won't get out of his head.  That has been a true effect of the tune for many people over many years.  It sticks inside, but in a good way.<br /><br />Chains is a classic originally composed by Carole King and her husband Gerry Goffin during their tenure as the Brill Building machine.  It was recorded as a hit single by The Cookies (Little Eva's backup singers) in 1962.  It is another standout rock & roll track but not nearly as emotionally delivered as the first two album tracks.  Critics weren't receptive, thinking the original a much more appreciable song, but Beatle fans loved it and Chains was a regular cover song performed by many British rock & roll bands in those days, it was almost a staple.<br /><br />The fact that The Beatles loved American girl-groups is inescapable now, as you will see.  Their next cover (and another on side two of the vinyl album) was by their favorite group The Shirelles.  \\"Boys\\" (by Dixon and Farrell) was a B-side to The Shirelles Will You Love Me Tomorrow (King & Goffin) and was another concert staple in rock and roll (usually performed by girl groups).  The Beatles take on it put Ringo on lead vocal, adjusted the words for a male singer, and just rocked it out hard!  The other Shirelles cover on PPM is the fantastic sweet pop song Baby It's You, (this one by Burt Bacharach with Dixon & David), a chart topper on initial release.  The Beatles version is note for note faithful to the original with outstanding vocals by John who croons it beautifully including the minor to major key changes.<br /><br />A Taste Of Honey was a popular 60's instrumental (A Grammy Award winner for Herb Alpert in '65) and remarkably, to this day, no one knows who came up with the lyrics to the song, they have been un-credited ever since the first vocal recording (Lenny Welch in '62).  Paul sings a beautiful lead and during the middle-8 his vocals are double tracked, resulting in an outstanding pop performance.<br /><br />The last cover, and last track on the album, is the epic Twist & Shout, a smash single by The Isley Brothers now with shredded vocals by John Lennon.  One of their hottest performances ever, it should be noted that in the 9 hour recording marathon, John had a nasty cold with a sore throat.  George Martin knew he was going to kill this song so saved the recording of it for last!  Johns voice suffered after the initial take and a second one was impossible, but the results are one of the finest one-take rock & roll performances ever made.<br /><br />All eight of the Lennon/McCatney compositions on the album are highly note-worthy of The Beatles catalogue in that they were the initial top creative juices of The Beatles first recording sessions.  I Saw Her Standing There, Please Please Me, Love Me Do, Do You Want To Know A Secret, all sold as smash singles and even the B-sides PS I Love You and Ask Me Why received commercial success.  All of the songs are terrific pop and rock songs setting the stage for \\"The British Invasion\\".  Of these, Please Please Me and Do You Want To Know A Secret are the most rewarding musically.  The first is an out and out rocker which far and away surpasses the original novelty of Love Me Do by a mile.  The harmonica and the bottom riffs of guitar provide a much better rock and roll beat and the John & Paul vocal splits are dynamic and top notch.  Do You Want To Know A Secret is a Lennon-masterpiece written for George to sing lead on.  It was actually inspired by Walt Disney's Snow White & The Seven Dwarves tune \\"I'm Wishing\\" which Julia Lennon (John's Mum) used to sing to him as a child.  The movie tune went \\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\\" and provided perfect lyrical inspiration for a mid-tempo pop-rock tune with Lennon-McCartney harmony backing.<br /><br />McCartney accomplished the same thing with There's A Place, originally inspired by \\"Somewhere there's a place for us...\\" line in West Side Story, a soundtrack adored by Paul.  The song has some incredible vocal antics and depending on taste you might like it a lot, or not.  I place it low on the album lineup but many critics cite it as one of the best early Beatles tunes.  For me, the best Lennon-McCartney shared vocal lead comes on Misery, a perfect early `60's pop rocker.  Interesting history on Misery:  this comes from Bill Harry's Ultimate Beatles Encyclopedia, [In February 1963, Helen Shapiro was Britain's most successful female singer (having first achieved chart success two years earlier at the age of 14) and The Beatles were fifth on the bill as part of her nationwide tour of the United Kingdom.  Her artist and repertoire manager, Norrie Paramor, was looking for new material for a country and western album she planned to record in Nashville, Tennessee and suggested that the Beatles compose a song especially for her.  \\"Misery\\" was started backstage before The Beatles' performance at the King's Hall, Stoke-on-Trent, on 26 January 1963, and later completed at Paul McCartney's Forthlin Road home.  At the time, McCartney commented: \\"We've called it 'Misery', but it isn't as slow as it sounds, it moves along at quite a pace, and we think Helen will make a pretty good job of it.\\"  But Paramor considered it unsuitable, and so British singer and entertainer Kenny Lynch, who was on the same tour, recorded it instead, thus becoming the first artist to cover a Lennon-McCartney composition although he failed to enter the charts with it.]  George Martin, The Beatles producer, actually recorded the piano track separately, adding it in after the two-track recording.<br /><br />Ask Me Why is a blatant Lennon attempt at imitating the style of Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, in fact the opening guitar is straight out of \\"What's So Good About Goodbye\\".  This is pretty much as close to Doo-Wop as The Beatles would ever get.<br /><br />On the grand scale of music in general I give this album (and all other Beatles albums) 5 stars, but if comparing PPM to the rest of the Beatles catalogue alone, I would give it 4 stars (and no Beatles album gets any lower than 4 stars from me).  It is a wonderful relic of the past, and I do listen to it, and all my Beatles albums, on CD regularly.  All the Beatles music is in regular rotation on my mp3 player.  My favorites all start in '65 with HELP! and RUBBER SOUL, everything from there on getting 5 Stars comparatively to the rest of the body of work.  Of the first 4 Beatles albums, the original two-track recorded albums, if I was to give advice to a novice, I would point them in the direction of HARD DAYS NIGHT, the album with the most creative output on it from the early era and definitely the best overall sounding of the first four.  BEATLES FOR SALE spills over some of that but only approximately half (they were starting to figure out the engineering process and were recording their first overdubs to 4-track on these two albums), because the rest of 4 Sale harkens back to the first two album stylistically and technologically (due to the fact that they were rushed to get it out and had to add filler from older cast-asides).  All in all though, remembering that I am a Beatlemaniac of the first order, it is difficult to rate anything they have done poorly or even with mediocrity.  Therefore, as a classic recording would go, this is an item that belongs in everyone's collection if they like modern music and appreciate rock and roll.  The 2009 stereo release or the 1988 original mono?  Well partner, that isup to you!  There are things I like about both masters, and things I dislike about them, usually by virtue of missing one when listening to the other, get it?<br /><br />Okay, now you go get it!oons it beautifully including the minor to major key changes.<br /><br />A Taste Of Honey was a popular 60's instrumental (A Grammy Award winner for Herb Alpert in '65) and remarkably, to this day, no one knows who came up with the lyrics to the song, they have been un-credited ever since the first vocal recording (Lenny Welch in '62).

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Casino Royale set a high bar for Daniel Craig's first crack at Bond, as 007 out on his first mission.  Now Skyfall is a good romp as a Bond who is in burnout mode.  But it does not rise to the same bar as Casino Royale.  Don't get me wrong; it has all the Bond film attributes: action followed by action, great villain (Javier Bardem gives a classic creepy performance), sex interests, interesting cinematography of landscape and tubescape, and macho cool. I am not sure what separates the two films for me.  Perhaps, it is the novelty of Casino Royale's portrayal of Bond learning that having attachments in his occupation comes with the risks of being hurt.  Skyfall track more closely with the 50-year tradition of Bond films--the Bond who is emotionally cool in all situations, even when close to an emotional freefall as in Skyfall.
0452295548|5.0|I was fascinating to read about how a scientist and researcher was able to document every event that happened to her during her stroke. She is a miracle for sure. I also wanted to see her perspective as to how spirituality played into her recovery. I then passed the book along to a friend who has had a stroke and in recovery himself now. He has been moved to take more action in his own recovery based on her story. Never ever give up. She is living proof.

B00005AWMF|5.0|There is no other that sound like Sade. She has a beautiful voice and one that is distinctly unique. I love the album.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I love David Bowie, old and new.  This album isn't glorifying the old days, it isn't Bowie taking on a whole new persona, it's just David Bowie at his finest.  It's raw and real; he does what he wants and he's good at it.
B00114RKT8|5.0|This should be required viewing in public schools.  What an amazing story and incredible piece of history that I doubt is told very often.  Extremely moving.....
B00454U1NS|4.0|Alot of Pink's songs are great to dance to but I should have checked it's rating before purchasing. Lots of F---- words and such so I won't play it for anyone under 18 yrs. Would rather have an edited version. But the music is great.<br />Definately not for younger than 18.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|... but I have to start over. I have all the islands and pretty much all the dragons on my iPod, but I start from scratch here. If there is a way to transfer my park to this I would be in heaven
0345529057|5.0|Although the format isn't amazing, it is what one can expect from mass market paperback.  The deal you're getting (if you purchase it for $22ish)  is amazing.  You get the first 3500+ pages of the most epic fantasy series of all time.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My 3 year old and I can sit and watch Sofia The First together, and we both enjoy it! The music is darling and the lessons Sofia learns are tender and understandable for a young girl. Even my 9yr old and 7yr old love to sit and watch it with the little one (they ask to watch it with her all the time). Darling, darling show. This DVD only has the very first Sofia episode (it is 48 minutes). My only complaint is that I wish it had more episodes!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book engages all of your emotions.  Th authors voice is witty, and sarcastic, and humorous in a way that leaves a smile on your face.  I loved it!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't use Face Book much on my Kindle yet. I did try to play candy crush and was dissappointed it's not supported on Kindle.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very simple to use. UI is nicely laid out and provides the right amount of information.  Would recommend this app to everyone!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|I just started playing this game. It can get very intense and I have to make sure I don't get loud playing in public.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|the author Emma Donoghue truly did her research for this book and it shows. Magical, unbelievable, heartbreaking and educational all in one.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have had a great time with this game. Hours of fun so beware. Only complaint is that it goes too fast.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|this movie is so cool and dark but with a surpising ending its fun to watch and keeps you totally entertained
B00338QENI|5.0|Much empathy for Lacks family and ironic facts of family being so destitute.  Fascinating, educational and heartbreaking. Kudos to Rebecca.
B00005QW5X|5.0|As i said this movie changed my life the music and acting is way beyound outstanding and i would recommed everyone to see this
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this game is very addictive raaawrr i play it every day man dis game be sexy yeah mah alarm clock be callin mah name
B002MEW7YY|5.0|I call this Anna Netrebko's Lucia De Lammermoor as I consider her singing and acting nothing short of brilliant.In 1960 as a young man living in London I had the privilege of attending a performance with Joan Sutherland in the role of Lucia at Covent Garden.Over the years having watched other performances nothing ever matched Joan Sutherland's singing and acting until I heard Anna Netrebko sing and act.Netrebko is truly special.Of course while I am waxing lyrical about Anna suffice it to say that the entire opera was excellent and all the singers ,conductor.chorus and staging make this DVD amust for every opera lovers collection.
B007THA4FI|2.0|A real departure . The book was long and real downer. While the book I'm sure displays real life, it is not  an environment I choose to dwell in especially with so many characters with few to redeeming features.  I would not recommend this book.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Wanted to get that out as I see some are having problems with the installation on their KINDLE FIRES !  Love the game .... Developer really seems to know how to make the match 3 games..  HAVE many PLAYRIX apps and will continue supporting them. Am excited to see more games are &quot;coming soon&quot;!  Great graphics!  Thank you FAOTD!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Excellent animations, sound effects, and just enough story to make this a different match 3 game.No problem with save games as others have reported.Why not 5 stars? While the graphics are nice, they do look a bit dated. Get it while you can!
1938469011|5.0|I'm new to this art and this book helped me a lot in the beginning! Really recommend to everyone! o/
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a Grisham work that encourages the reader to sympathize -- and empathize -- with the narrator in the first person.  One hopes the outcome will be good, but the reader is not prepared for the startling finish with its twists, revelations and admissions.  This is John Grisham &#34;out of the box&#34;, but in fantastically effective story-telling mode.  You've gotta read this one!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Cute fun and addicting this game is all three and more. Never in my life had a game like this.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love the show.  Love the books.  Love the special features on the discs because it helps my non reader wife put things in perspective.<br /><br />The audio commentaries were great and the making of Blackwater Bay was incredible.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Cool book for teenagers & up...<br />Understandably written and adventurous story.<br />Only recommendable to all of the Amazon readers. ;-)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it! Warning: Thoroughly addictive! ;) Great place to get and share ideas. My family and I live a very healthy lifestyle. I love the inspirations for recipes &amp; gardening, not to mention creative craft ideas for homeschooling.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am a fan of Accuweather and am happy to have it on the go with my Kindle fire.  I am able to clearly see the forecast and plan my week on the spot. Working on a farm with horses leaves me always asking what the weather will be, I no longer wonder.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for kids, especially little girls. My 9 yr old loves it. She spends hours playing it, and never gets bored.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I first read this book some 35 years ago when I was about twelve.  It belonged to my mother and was actually the german translation.<br />\\"Ein Baum waechst in Booklyn\\" will always be one of my favorites. It shows you that you don't need a lot to be happy.<br />I wanted to read the original and will purchase it today.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I was not dissapointed at all with Bruno Mars sophmore cd, this cd left me wantin more, and I can listen to it over and over
B00BVYR0IO|5.0|This show is easily a favorite.  It just keeps getting better and better this season (#3), especially with episode #14.  They know how to do suspense here, but this episode really stood out.  It's not just all action, however; if you're looking for something with some depth, and characters you actually care about, this show has both.  It explores the tough questions we don't like to consider, and don't have to, unless we lived in a setting like this.  The source material must be great (I haven't read the graphic novels, yet).<br /><br />Just watch this show, from the beginning!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I am very happy with this cd I have already memorized the songs. Also I love Bruno Mars music and creativity
B003G4W49C|5.0|If you haven't read this book yet, you're in for a treat. If only great books could last forever. Enjoy!
1419705849|5.0|Author: Jeff Kinney<br />Published: 2012<br />Genre: Comedy<br /><br />Synopsis: Greg and Rowly are best friends and do everything together, but sometimes Greg takes advantage of him. That's why sometimes he hates Greg, but they usually become friends again. Greg has two brothers, the oldest is Rodrick. He's a drummer and tries to make Greg's life miserable. The youngest is Manny, he loves to cheat people out and always ruins Greg's and Rodrick's stuff. Their dad is super cheap and will buy anything if it is on sale. Their mom is extremely caring and over protected mother, she will embarrass her kids anywhere. Greg's friend Rowly loves to be himself, on the other hand Greg is always trying to act cool. He just wants to get all of the girls and friends, but Rowly ends up being popular just by being himself. A big problem that Greg has is that he is desperate for money and loves to be cheap like his dad.<br />Book rating: 9<br />The Diary of the wimpy kid is very funny and the characters do stuff you wouldn't expect. The book couldn't be funnier. The thing is that some scenes you can't understand because of the exaggeration on the pictures.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Ever since me and my sister got this app on my dads phone we have gotten it on my moms phone and my kindle. Hay!!!!!  :D :D
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I'll start out saying that I actually like the Percy Jackson series very much.  They're all very well written and the Greek and Roman mythology is woven into these stories in a very intriguing way. And I also think that the series has gotten more interesting as the characters have gotten older in the last two novels.  So overall I liked The Mark of Athena, I just found it disappointing and this is why.<br />First of all, way too much teenie drama.  I think some relationship drama is appropriate considering the audience but it could definitely be labeled as overkill and melodramatic.  It felt like there were brief respites of action and story-line and then it was back to the characters obsessing over their relationships and sometimes their nonexistent relationships.  This was probably my worst problem with the book but I also feel like the series is being dragged on and it honestly should have just ended with this book.<br />So overall the book's not horrible.  The teenie drama could be considered a positive or negative aspect depending on your perspective.  And in my opinion the series should have just ended with this book and is being dragged on now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone! My younger sister recommended it to me and I can say that I'm so glad she did because it is one of the best books I've ever read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I resisted being drawn into this series for a while, but I saw the movie when it came out, loved it, bought the book, and loved it.  Many reviews already talk about the plot and really unless you've been living under a rock you know people are being killed in The Hunger Games.  Nevertheless, why I like this book is that it's pretty original, has a very strong heroine who not only tries to fight for what's right but also struggles with the concept of what is right, and has a fast paced story-line and well-constructed world by Suzanne Collins.<br />I love this series, can't wait for the next movie to come out, and would definitely recommend buying The Hunger Games if you're hesitating over whether it's worth it or not.  Because it is.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I bate that I accidentally deleted it and lost all my unlocked games and money and I keep getting my email bsck from support as undeliverable
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I would definitely recommend getting this book.  I saw the movie first and loved it and decided to take a chance on the book.  The book is definitely more serious than the movie but at the same time very funny if you like the dry wit type of humor that The Silver Linings Playbook possesses.  Great read with a touching ending.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Intrigue will suck you in and keep you going, but it's ultimately not worth it. It was disappointing and I have no desire to read on in the trilogy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Truly captures a young mature love. Reminded me so much of Romeo and Juliet where their fighting families were more like cancer
B008M87GJK|1.0|Why can't I download this app outside the UK? Very disappointed as I really wanted to enjoy reading the BBC news. Seems odd that a major international news station can only be viewed in the UK!
1401941893|5.0|I love, love, love this book!!!!! I would recommend this book to any woman out there who has low self esteem and low confidence in themselves. This book has taught me to believe in myself everyday and have confidence in myself to achieve my goals and dreams. Miranda also give you strong quotation to read if your ever feeling down about yourself. It actually teaches you more about yourself and reality.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I chose this game because I'm a big fan of rhythm based games and was very satisfied with this product. I would have liked a freestyle mode, but its hard to complain with a free game. Good for a quick music gaming fix.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|As far as I know I have all of his albums and video dvd's.  My wife and I love to see the man perform and hear his great voice a musical instrument.  God has required much from him: howerver, he blessed him greatly!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is just plain addictive.lol I got this because I am a huge Columns/Tetris fan since the Sega Game Gear/NES days and this does not disappoint at all. Absolutely no complaints here. A great choice in Kindle gaming.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show! It continues to be outstanding! This season is better than a history book to learn of the horrors of WWI.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I made it 3/4 the way through the movie.  This is the most boring Bond movie ever made!  I just can't finish it.  It feels like punishment.  The acting is good but the story is so dang slow!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've used both Flipboard and Feedly and have come to prefer Feedly. It takes fewer clicks to access the articles I want to read and loads quickly.
B0007TKNII|1.0|The disc had a bad sector - with a visible gouge.  However, this gift to someone wasn't opened right away.  The procedure for return and/or refund wasn't clear.  Primary packaging had already been discarded.  Thus, stuck in the mud.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Although this title pales in comparison to Roller Coaster Tycoon and related games, its great for a free app. The in game mission keeps the game from getting stale and I was especially impressed with the ability to travel to the undersea section of the park.
B003L9CMNU|2.0|I watched this movie as people have been talking about it for decades and I was pretty disappointed in the characters and their lack of depth.  Snooze.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|what else can you say? the app is awesome and works as it should for all your purchasing needs. I use it too often in fact!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I LOVED this book, I LOVE the movie! What a great message it puts out there for both kids and adults.  I can watch this movie with my son over and over again!

B0083SBJXS|5.0|So glad we purchased this movie ... We have watched it several times and it just keeps getting better. Puny god...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The most addictive game ever . And best of all its free!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone.best best best

B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this app a lot and I play it every day and its epic epic epic epic epic epic epic epic epic epic epic epic
B00846F1YW|5.0|This is a very fun game. It can be slightly difficult using a phone than a tablet, but still doable. I'm glad I got it on the sale day since it was too short to pay $3 for it, but I'd pay 99 cents for it. The dialogue from the reporter's perspective (aka yours) is very sarcastic and mostly matched my thoughts. It's kind of weird when you realize that the entire town is made up of hoarders, but it's still enjoyable.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Una pel&iacute;cula genial!!, vale la pena tenerla, buenos efectos, historia interesante, el mito bond se conserva con fantasticos actores y actrices y una trama bien desarrollada...

B00ANAC32U|5.0|Love it!!! amazing quality and the side buttons where very cool. I will recommend it to anyone. Very secure fit also.
B00004STPT|5.0|I listen to this pretty much every morning. This came rather quickly with no faults in really great condition this is a beautiful piece of music.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this game I have to force my self to put it down .u should probably get this app.you will have to force your self to put it down I did.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|This cd is INCREDIBLE. I don't like that it's more expensive for the digital version than the physical album. I also don't like that there is a Target exclusive with two additional tracks...makes little sense in a digital world to still do that (just encourages people to get the additional songs illegally). Regardless, this CD is still incredible.<br /><br />There are only 10 songs, but the entire CD is an hour and 10 minutes...that's an average of 7 minutes per song...which means for the songs that you love, they are some long editions of the songs to just groove to. That turns this cd into a GREAT driving CD. JT isn't the stereotypical pop artist. His music has a very R&B feel to them. All of his CDs have been like that... so it'd be bizarre to expect something different. So if you're expecting something to sound like his N'Sync days, you'll be disappointed...but if you're expecting something along the lines of Robin Thicke (just not as sexual), you'll enjoy this CD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game to play look good plays smooth could use a few things added but all around a good game for all ages
B005Q1W10A|5.0|After seeing season 1 on Roku then Season 3 on TV, I needed season 2 to fill in the gaps!<br /><br />It was really a good film!
1616550414|5.0|Great read. I would recommend to any fan of the Zelda series. Illustrations and information bring a much more complicated story to the series.
1451695195|5.0|Having read many books about NDE, this book was particularly interesting because the author is also a neurosurgeon dealing with brain and spinal cord injury and disease on a regular basis.  His descriptions are amazing, yet understandable and believable. I highly recommend this to anyone who has doubts about life after death!
B00BF2RV22|5.0|At long last, it's here! If you love the acoustic period of Miles Davis' career here is a concert that he recorded very late in life and (luckily) at a time when audio/video technology was very advanced. Here is the 1991 concert at the jazz festival in Montreux, Switzerland conducted by his long time friend and admirer Quincy Jones. And at this performance Miles finally relented and went back to the music that made him famous. It's Miles once again with the Gil Evans Orchestra playing from the albums Miles Ahead, Porgy & Bess and Sketches of Spain (plus Boplicity from Birth of The Cool). This blue-ray release is one I've been waiting for all these years and today I received my copy.<br /><br />I bought a VHS copy of the concert six years ago and played it again yesterday. The song \\"Springsville\\"  (the first song on the album \\"Miles Ahead\\") which is the second song on the VHS release of the concert is missing from the blue-ray disk and that is my one disappointment. Springsville is a beautiful piece. Also missing are interviews by Herbie Hancock, George Duke and Quincy Jones, as well as practice sessions that precede the concert on the VHS version. But Claude Nobs' interview and seven more that follow (including one by Betty Carter) paint a vivid and delightful portrait of the great jazz trumpeter who died only three months after this historic live performance. You'd think that all of the preceding material on the VHS that was removed to keep the main show here at exactly one hour would be moved into a \\"bonus\\" section. Alas, that is not so. Hold on to your old VHS copy if you still have it.<br /><br />Miles did admit that the music performed here was difficult to play, given the logistics required and minor variations in performance can be detected when compared to the studio recordings. But the giddiness on the faces of Quincy Jones and Wallace Roney on stage leaves no doubt at all that they treasured the opportunity to perform. And Miles, at this age, could use the help of trumpeter Roney on stage.<br /><br />My long wait for this blue ray release is well worth it. The performance is impressive and audio and video quality is equally so. (You'd expect Miles to perform for at least two hours at a concert and that makes me suspect there's more footage of this concert in the vault). Get your copy today.help of trumpeter Roney on stage.<br /><br />My long wait for this blue ray release is well worth it. The performance is impressive and audio and video quality is equally so.

B00B99KJR0|4.0|Fluid gameplay, entertaining story blurbs. Would've liked a little more educational content in the storyline,  but that's just a personal preference.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love match 3 games. I used to play this on the computer and love it. And you can replay the ones you only got one or two stars so can go on for a long time. Good going Playrix!

B00B23O96A|5.0|This guys talent never seems to end. The older he gets the better he gets. Some people may not like that he is slowing done some, but who doesn't? The fact that he does it with ability & style is what matters.

B008EZVNO0|5.0|This guy is great. He will always be great in my book. A voice like no other & Irish to boot. Another of those few artists who know how to grow old along with their music.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I ordered this Tin Case collectors piece for nothing more than an investment to keep until my grandchildren are ready to give it to there grandchildren. This will never be opened by me anyway. I like the case just for an addition to my Sci Fi collection of Lost in Space stuff. I am a robot nut and had to have something from Robby the Robot. This movie collection will do just right. Now I am going to buy the lesser expensive DVD and enjoy the movie. Enjoy this piece if you get one. I recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this game because you can change the game to peaceful or mobs and you can make a seed for a would.
B006P0FIGU|5.0|I have always thought that the version of this story with Oliver Platt, Chris O'Donnell, Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen would be my favorite.  Well, I can no longer say that.  This is the best version of this story and I will watch it over and over again.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought this was awesome But I do have some responds to this game it needs to have more levels and diffrent secens and more ways to earn coins fast. Oh and the prices need to be marked down on items, I love this game and enjoy playing it everyday. I mean I started one day playing it and couldn't stop. Keep it coming and don't stop making changes to this game!!!!!
0618918248|4.0|Richard Dawkins is such a great scientist that I cannot follow all matters he explores in this book. I loved reading the book until it dawned upon me that after talking of all the damage religious fanaticism has caused in the world and is causing (Real Talibans and Christian American Talibans) he doesn't say a word about the cause of all these troubles. If God is the problem then he should have started by talking of those who invented God in the first place, namely the Hebrews. He should have told the story of that people who pretended God had chosen them (well, there was no other peoples to choose from as He was ignored by everybody else) and gave them a land which was already inhabited by others. They used violence and committed crimes to acquire that land. That is history but the worst thing about this story, is that some 2.000 years later, using the same argument, people of that same religion, some descendants of the original Hebrews but also others who were invented (see Shlomo Sand) came from all the world to conquer the same land under the same pretext: God promised them the land. The result of this religious drive is there to see for all those who dare to look in that direction: millions of refugees, millions under military occupation, lost land and tens of thousands of dead, and the show continues. -<br />Richard DAwkins judges negatively religious people left and right but does not dare judge the originators of the monotheistic religions which he rightly says are the most damaging of ll.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The only problem I had with this game was that it was over too soon!  ,There were a few puzzles that had ridiculously hidden clues in shadows that were impossible to see, other than that I enjoyed it very much.

B009POCG2C|3.0|The film is fine.  But buyer beware about potential deception: the \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy\\" does not mean you can download this (to a computer, tablet, phone), in order to watch it offline (say, on a plane).  Rather, it can only be streamed--which means you need an active internet connection and, if on a cellular connection, must burn through your data allowance.
B008J34466|4.0|I love a couple of the tracks on here.  Unfortunately there are quite a few which I have to skip as I cant even listen to them
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is a great movie. I loved it! First I rented it and then I bought a copy of it. I don't buy a lot of movies, most are crap, but this one I knew I had to own. It was one of those movies that after watching, you walk away from the experience a different person. This movie inspires you to be a better person. That's a sign of a good movie.<br /><br />As for the complaints in various Amazon customer reviews concerning the acting, dialogue, and plot of the movie, to these people I say, \\"Get a life.\\" These complaints are trivial and result in the missed high points and quality of the movie. These people missed the point.<br /><br />If you like the movie as much as I did, I highly suggest reading Mr. Denver's new book entitled, \\"Damn Few\\". It's not the book version of the movie. It contains much more information about the SEALs, their training, and Mr. Denver's personal exploits in battle. If you want to learn more about the SEALs, the book is a Must Read.<br /><br />I highly recommend both the book and the movie. I personally own both. They are both for me time and money well spent.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1401324797 Damn Few: Making the Modern SEAL Warrior]]
B00079ZACM|5.0|Homer's Odyssey is not just an ancient Greek Poem but a super-story that is told in a re-packaged form again and again.  The hero, is chosen by fate to leave his home, go on an adventure with twists and turns, and then return home to fight for his wife's love again.<br /><br />At the height of the British Empire-before that noble enterprise burned in the Fires of both World Wars, Ulysses story was made about the British Re-Conquest of the Sudan-an 1898 lightening war where British Regulars trounced a force of Islamic Radicals.<br /><br />The movie starts with a reunion of British veterans of the Crimean War.  These men were not just veterans, but high ranking officers of the campaign.  They are the stiff-upper lip aristocrats, whose ancestors built Britain into a world power and they are highly conscious of their caste, their duties, and their reputations. Invited to their dinner is Harry Faversham (Clive Baxter as the young Faversham and John Clements as the elder).  He is toasted by his father's colleagues.  Young Faversham is troubled-deep down he fears he is a coward unable to live up to the path laid out for him by the Fates.<br /><br />Years later, Faversham is an officer in the Royal North Surrey Regiment.  On the eve of his Regiment's deployment to the Sudan, Faversham resigns his commission.  Outraged, the important members of his social class, his wife, and three of his fellow officers give him four white feathers, thus branding him a coward.<br /><br />Faversham then goes to the Sudan disguised as a mute native.  He goes on to save his fellows and return the feathers to each of the three through a series of great adventures.  The fourth feather is returned to his wife after he wins back her hand-while thwarting a rival suitor.<br /><br />The rival suitor, Captain John Durrance (Ralph Richardson) is indeed the heart of the show.  Although blind, Captain Durrance commands his company against a savage attack by Dervishes.  When he realizes he was wrong about Harry Faversham, he exits the scene in a graceful, heartfelt way.<br /><br />The story of the Four Feathers has been made into a movie several times since it was first put to film in 1915. Most recently Heath Ledger starred in a morose 2002 version.  The 1939 version of the story is by far the best, most interesting and enjoyable.Harry Faversham, he exits the scene in a graceful, heartfelt way.<br /><br />The story of the Four Feathers has been made into a movie several times since it was first put to film in 1915.

B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Despite \\"purists\\" and, I must include myself among them, I found this take on a singular book to be a more appropriate look at The Hobbit.  Yes, Peter Jackson could have made it into one film with little character development and lots of CGI, but I find that this expansive three-part series to have more depth and story telling which should have been incorporated into the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  So, there, that's about all I have to say on the matter.  It is long, and the casting could not have been better in my opinion.  I give it 5 stars.
B009J3K4MI|5.0|This box set is an embarrassment of riches. I have gone through 15 CDs so far (25% of the entire set) and I've already received my money's worth.<br />There is really too much to comment on for a quick review. I will point out the fact that one can look into individual CDs available on Amazon that by themselves are considered among the handful of best performances available - and they are here.<br />Munch conducting the BSO, Reiner with the Chicago Symphony, Fiedler, Rubenstein...and the red book quality of 60 year old recordings is, so far, wonderful.<br />Whether you are a long-time classical completest or a relative newcomer who is looking for a great place to start, the &#34;Living Stereo Box Set&#34; is highly recommended.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|To paraphrase Frank Zappa-writing about this collection of music is like trying to listen to architecture.  What more can be said about a consummate musician playing at the top of his game?  It's quite simply a stunning overview of Allman's work from his early days to near the end of his life.  Duane Allman is certainly one of the best guitar players-not only in the blues/rock/soul/r&b genres (also including his sometimes Coltrane like solos), but one of the best to ever pick up the instrument.  How could he play with such sensitivity-his solos full of feeling-and yet sometimes raw and smokin' hot?<br /><br />Will there be some quibbling as to what's included and what should have been included?  Probably.  And that's okay, because his playing was so good that a lot of his equally fine music just wouldn't fit unless this collection was expanded to several more discs, and this is a retrospective of Allman's work.  But there's so much to enjoy here-even the familiar tunes seem to have added weight-because the music was judiciously chosen.  Hearing all this music in one place makes it even plainer that Allman was a one-of-a-kind-player.  I still remember hearing the ABB in their \\"Live Fillmore\\" period several times. And even towards the end of a tour, when the band was tired, Duane Allman would always rise to the occasion.  Those concerts are towards the top of my list of the best shows from the late 60's/early 70's.<br /><br />The packaging is very nice.  Inside the substantial long box is a faux gold velvet lining, and two strings that are underneath the discs, which help get them out of the box.  Each disc is inside a soft paper envelope, with the tracks listed on the back.  The booklet (a bit shorter than the outer box) has an essay about Allman and the music included here. There's also an essay by Allman's daughter about her feelings for her father (\\"I am always searching for a song, a photograph, a moment saved in someone's memory to bring my father into sharper focus.\\"), and gives this set a close personal feel.  The many photographs (b&w and color) are also well thought out.  Also included is a chronological track listing that has session details-most notably who played on what.<br /><br />There's something for just about everybody here.  I say just about everybody because deep fans/collectors will certainly have most of this music.  But again, to hear Duane Allman's guitar (lead/slide/acoustic/electric/dobro) in the various contexts included in this set, makes for a powerful yet sensitive, exciting yet sometimes subtle, listening experience.  To fully hear and enjoy this collection, you'll need to listen to it a couple of times through-and just let the music run through your head.  Bouncing from the ABB to Ronnie Hawkins, to Lulu, and then Johnny Jenkins and John Hammond, not to mention the great Doris Duke, is touching on several genres of music in a relatively short time.  Likewise from Sam Samudio to Ronnie Hawkins (again), to Delaney and Bonnie & Friends, to the ABB, to the Grateful Dead-and then back to the ABB, to Herbie Mann-is quite a musical journey.  One last thing.  Why aren't the albums by Cowboy in print?  Their Capricorn Records albums need a good dusting off and given the \\"deluxe\\" treatment-remastering, period studio and live tracks-the whole works.  I still have the original vinyl albums and every time I hear them I wonder when they will be reissued.<br /><br />I hope the fact that this is a \\"limited edition of 10,000\\" will allow all the people who want this set to purchase it.  On the underside of the box is that box's number of 10,000.  I thought long and hard about purchasing this collection because of the price.  But in the end art is priceless.

B00BFHZOCG|2.0|First off you would think the whole band would be involved in making a Garage Days sort of album, based on The New British Wave of Heavy Metal, not rock n roll songs. Granted when Metallica did Garage Inc. the songs were more \\"rockish\\" but still not that bad. I never thought or wanted to hear a group like Anthrax do covers of Journey, Thin Lizzy, AC'DC, or Boston (especially). One thing i will admit, the covers are very good<br /><br />So why the low rating, well because i would rather hear Anthrax do Iron Maiden, Angel Witch, Venom, Diamond Head etc. The stuff that made them who they are(were). I even read the article that the band had nothing to do with the choices of what songs to put on the EP. It was all songs Joey Liked when HE grew up. Also his voice does sound great, but why not use that on a track like Iron Maidens Killers, or a Judas Priest song like Tyrant or something. So the songs may be great but hearing Anthrax cover \\"Cheap Trick\\"?? Yeah i rest my case. Joeys voice sounds better than ever, and he wastes it on mediocre rock songs, when he should be screaming(singing) \\"real METAL\\"!! So this is just a little baby cash cow to make some doe. New Anthrax on the way? Hopefully, and lets hope its thrash and not more of the popish stuff that we got on Worship Music.<br /><br />At any rate this is just a silly album of Cover songs that you can find on Youtube that have been up for actually over a month. From Nuclear Blast. So if you want to pay for this, well that's your deal. At any rate, good sounding covers, just a horrible selection of songs. Btw, you can tell the rest of the band is just \\"going\\" through the motions, and Scott Ian is thinking oh God, we had to let Joey have his way again. Later fans. ;o)<br /><br />Even if you dislike or disagree with the review, you HAVE to admit i have a valid point here. ;o)

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this pack. It is fully customizable. I have 2 canon T3's. 1 with lens that came with the camera and the other with a300mm. I also have room for my 35-350mm some old fixed focals. It is also very comfortable. I toted it around for 2 days in shreveport on the boardwalk.
B00BDPW7XE|3.0|To my ears this is a totally different direction than Part One.  Besides parts of \\"East Coast Racer\\" (my fave) this disc is very mellow and emotional with lots of orchestration. The brass and string arrangements are well done, but for me it sounds too nice and I would rather the band rock out.  Of the arranged songs, the one that stands out for me is \\"Leopards\\" with a Simon and Garfunkel meets Jellyfish groove. \\"Worked Out\\" has a definite Genesis/Tull sound and is awesome until they sing \\"We're working men\\".  How they sing that melody line drags the song down for me.<br /><br />If you enjoy lush arrangements and less rock this release is for you.  I believe Part One had stronger compositions and it rocks more.
0307744434|4.0|So, The Night Circus... I wish I could have given it 3.5 stars - somewhere between it was okay, and I liked it. Given that it was well-written and imaginative, I'll tip it to four stars. On one hand, I was immediately drawn in, but it faltered about half way through. I never do this, but I actually read four books before I returned to finish the second half. The praise is spot on in many respects - the different viewpoints meld together seamlessly, in part because of the shortness of the chapters. The imagery is stunning and it is a very interesting premise. I felt such a sense of urgency at the climax of the story that I could not have imagined putting the book down. Unfortunately, the critiques are also precisely on point - many of the characters are one-dimensional, it's a love story with very little passion and there really is no meaningful competition. When I think of magicians' dueling, I think of the movie, The Prestige. There is so much material that could have been tapped into. The competition should not have become a peripheral issue when it was the impetus behind the story. I really wanted to like this book so much more than I did in the end, and I suppose that ultimately just makes me sad. The beginning held so much promise, and the end was so beautifully suspenseful that I felt sad contemplating how much better it could have been. As it were, it is an enjoyable read, though I would recommend with the reservation of appreciating that it does not quite live up to the hype.

People are straining to find meaning to link the nested pieces of this book together. I don't care. Enjoy the great read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show.  I wasted (well worth it, though) hours watching back to back episodes.  Each episode leaves you wanting for more.  I finished Season 3 and felt I needed some sort of support group because I was walking around in a state of mourning (not full mourning, as Mary said) because the show had ended.  Season 4 cannot get here fast enough.

B00BRR66SA|4.0|Justin Timberlake is back with the long anticipated follow up to his massively successful \\"Future Sex/Love Sounds\\" with \\"The 20/20 Experience.\\" The first single off the album \\"Suit and Tie\\" marks a more mature sound of sorts for Timberlake. This sound is recreated throughout the new album.<br />1. Pusher Love Girl: One of the themes of \\"The 20/20 Experience\\" is addiction, specifically to women or whatever particular woman that influenced his writing. The song is a fun mix of funk, soul, and R&B. The song sets a great tone for the rest of the album by slowly progressing the album further, not pushing too hard too fast.<br />2. Suit & Tie: The album's first single has been a steady play in the Decker household. It really is unlike anything that is currently playing. The single combines a submarine sonar ping with 2013 pop music smarts. Clearly the single was meant to bring Timberlake back into the music mainstream with something fun and catchy and it succeeds.<br />3. Don't Hold the Wall: This was one of my personal favorites of the album. It is flavored with a little bit of influence from the hip hop world crossed with a beat from India. Just a really fun song that encourages you to jump in with the music and makes you feel left out if you don't.<br />4. Strawberry Bubblegum: I really did not know what to make of this song. It's good, but it is kind of pedophiliaish. It is more like something off his first album than the grown up version of this album. It reminded me of some R & B from the early 90s with \\"The Boys\\" or \\"Another Bad Creation.\\" But, maybe mature women are chewing more gum these days.<br />5.Tunnel Vision: The tunnel vision of first love and lust has a well documented past. This song is a wonderful addition to the canon. At some point you wonder how many women he's used these lines on.<br />6. Spaceship Coupe: He's stealing your girl with this song. Trust. Back to that funky R&B sound of \\"Pusher Love Girl\\" Timberlake creates a web of lust that is tough to release from.<br />7. That Girl: This is a little different, it kinda harkens back to early 2000s and late 1990s with a break in the music and someone introducing \\"JT & The Tennessee Kids.\\" It isn't a necessarily a break in the general tone of the album, but it lacks that full experimental feel that the rest of the songs have.<br />8. Let The Groove Get In: Another fun dance track like \\"Don't Hold the Wall\\" this song is sure to light up radio stations all summer long. A little bit of salsa, R&B, and sexy it doesn't follow \\"That Girl\\" very well, but it stands out as one of the funner and more marketable songs of the album.<br />9. Mirrors:  The second last song on the album \\"Mirrors\\" is probably the most \\"beautiful\\" songs on the album. It shows a grounded side that Timberlake really hasn't shown in the past. He is a man in love with his soul mate and it really shines through in the reflection of his voice.<br />10.Blue Ocean Floor: A very slow and interesting piece to use at the end of the album. This is another song, probably not meant for radio rotation, but that has some really good merits otherwise. The background beat slowly builds and if you close your eyes that ocean becomes crystal clear and real.<br />Most of the songs on the album exceed 7 minutes apiece which is unusual, but it doesn't feel like that long. There isn't any moments where you are going \\"Okay...enough is enough let's move on..\\"<br />Relisten Possibility: 9 out of 10.

Seems odd she's so deferential on matters such as the course of her entire life and then eager to wrestle verbally with a young employee who wants to stay home and look for a boyfriend. I'm not sure this book is about anything except headlines but if it's to give younger women additional credibility with men, and she says the book isn't just for women, then the opposite seems to be true.

B000JMKQX0|1.0|I LOVE zombies, and I really had my heart set on this \\"amazing\\" book I've heard so much about. It sounded like a one of a kind exciting, gritty story. It was none of the above.<br /><br />It tells the story of the world wide zombie epidemic, that apparently takes place over the course of 20 years or so (though throughout this book written as a documentation of the events, it's surprisingly vague)<br /><br />It jumps back and forth from one year to another. First you start at the beginning, then you're 5 years in, then 10 then back to 2 or 3 years in, then back to the beginning, then back to the end, etc etc. There is no continuity, and no real sense of what's going on anywhere at the time, except for the one little story you happen to be reading at that moment, which focuses on one person or one town, and basically gives you a brief synopsis of events. You have absolutely no attachment to any character in the book, because you only hear one little story about them, so vague, so short. And that's what this book is. a collection of vague short stories mixed together.<br /><br />I think of the stories in this book like little teasers for a story that never comes. Imagine seeing a trailer for a movie and thinking \\"That looks awesome, I wanna see that!\\".  That's exactly how I felt reading this book. \\"That story sounds awesome, i wanna read all that\\". Nope, it's 10 pages long, on to the next story.<br /><br />Now again imagine seeing a couple trailers for a movie, then going to see it, and discovering that the movie itself is a collection of 30 trailers for a movie that doesn't really exist. That sums up how I felt reading this book. It's like a whole bunch of stories that would be great if there was any detail to them, or any attachment to the characters.<br /><br />Lastly, one thing I found very irritating: The book is written as interviews with people after the events. Every single person talks exactly the same. The Chinese guys, the Russian woman, the Australian. Coincidentally, they all talk like a white guy :/<br /><br />My opinion of this book:<br /><br />Overall 2/10<br /><br />Writing style 3/10<br /><br />Character development/attachment 1/10

B008QLXSG8|5.0|I didn't like this story. So why did I give it 5 stars?<br /><br />The main character is so uninteresting, he's fascinating. He's a sociopath in many regards. I was frustrated with it.<br /><br />However, it's the single best written story I've ever heard. I've never seen another book as beautifully written, ever. it's in a league of its own, and the writing itself, regardless of how much I did or did not like the story, is worthy of 5 stars.<br /><br />I consider my all time favorite books to be WOOL, Ready Player One, Alex, The Remaining series, and a couple others. I give them top ratings. yet this book I would say is more masterfully written than all of my favorite books combined, and I didn't even like this story. It makes no sense!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's great because you take care of a horse. You have a lot of fun. I also got to level 20 and the challenge begins. THANK YOU!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've only just started on the 5th book of this fascinating series, so I will update this as I go. But so far me review is only of the first 4 books.<br /><br />This is a unique series, since it started as about a 45 page short story that has spawned 6 books and counting. (hopefully many more to come). That's about 45 pages according to my tablet I read it on, minus the table of contents and things like that. It may not be a completely accurate number, but close enough to give you the idea.<br /><br />My mother thought the 1st book was somewhat slow moving. perhaps because I read it to her around 11pm and she was tired, but I find the book to be very intriguing from the opening sentence. I don't think it's fair to call it slow moving. I'd say it's just the right amount of slow (if you can call masterfully building up to the end, \\"slow\\") for a book that short, before it quickly becomes the most gripping story I've ever read, and in only 45 or so pages. The end itself left an impression on me few books of 400+ pages are capable of. I cannot recommend the 1st book enough. I single out the first book because once you read it, you WILL read the rest.<br /><br />I can't explain how the story changes from the 1st book to the 2nd without giving massive spoilers, so suffice to say, the story, as it progresses from book to book tells an amazing and mysterious story, with fantastic plot and character development. An interesting and unique world, best summed up by the author's description on amazon.com:<br /><br />\\"This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.\\" -Book description from Amazon.com<br /><br />The 4th book was fantastic. Ijust finished it today. So many mixed feelings, so many intense moments. My curiosity constantly tormented, my attachment to characters constantly threatened.<br /><br />The books range in size from about 45 pages to 250 pages of pure story, not counting the forward, table of contents, things like that. Very unique I think, for a series, and yet, it's perfect. Very easy, light reading, streamlined perfectly across the 4 books and counting that I've read.<br /><br />I feel like what I'm about to say seems as ridiculous as saying that a Bazooka Joe comic was more poetic than Hamlet, or that a 1 liner on a Popsicle stick was more insightful than Sun Tzu's Art of War, but I have to say that the Wool series is the best I've ever read, period. Better than The Hunger Games (a trilogy I loved) by a country mile. better Than Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. As ridiculous as it seems to say, better than The Wheel of Time series which I idolize. Such an unfair, unjust thing to say, that these few short books are better than some of the greatest works of fantasy ever created, but in my opinion, it's true for the simple fact that no other series has truly piqued my interest this much, from the very beginning, and to this moment and counting.<br /><br />It's not fair to compare it to The Wheel of Time, Hunger Games, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, or any other book, because they're so very different, but the bottom line remains: If I could only read one, it would be Wool.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and head on over to Amazon and pick up the Kindle version of the omnibus for a ridiculously low price. And while you're at it, head over to author Hugh C. Howey's website and check out his other works.<br /><br />I have never been more excited to read a book in my life, and I cannot do this series justice. Read the first book for yourself, and you won't put it down. It's so short, it requires minimal time and effort on your part to read one of the best stories I've ever read.<br /><br />Rather than break it down from book to book, or various aspects from plot to character development, I will keep this simple.<br /><br />*EDIT* should note that I did finish the 5th book, and it was as awesome as the rest.<br /><br />Overall rating: 10/10
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This is very enlightening of what pilots on both sides of the WW II conflict were face with and their personal involvement in the great war. These men's stories of their experiences provide another view of individual combat that is not often revealed to the those that are interested in history and survival.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book. Second time reading. It is better the second time. Rereading this gives you more clues to the future of the series.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|At first I didn't really like Justin those years back.  I thought he was just another white guy trying to be black.  But I was so wrong.  I gave his songs a listen and I loved his sound.  I first bought \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds\\" and I was blown away.  I wanted more.  I finally purchased his debut album \\"Justified\\" and was again obsessed with the songs.  He has a familiar yet original sound.  I wanted more again.  Then I heard \\"Suit and Tie\\" and played that song over 600 times literally according to my Itunes.  It is still my number one most played song.  Then the song \\"Mirrors\\" followed and I played that a little over 300 times.  Still a lot.  The point is that I was so damn excited to hear this new album.  I even stopped myself from listening to the album when Justin put the entire album to stream on Itunes the week before its release. Then finally I purchased the album at Target with the bonus tracks.<br /><br />The album has such an amazing epic cinematic feel to it.  I LOVE that most of the songs clock in at over 7 minutes.  I loved how some of the songs were like that in \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds\\" and I was excited to hear an entire album of those types of songs.  It gives the album a progressive and more artistic feel to it.  A progressive R&B/pop record.  Most people are complaining about the length of the songs without logical reasons.  These people usually don't appreciate what music really is.  He didn't make this album for the radio.  This is a masterful collection of songs.  Not a random collection of lame pop songs that were made just to get airplay.  The people criticizing this album about the length and slight lack of mass radio appeal are the opposite of Hipsters, but equally annoying.  Most of them have short attention spans as other reviewers have stated.  I didn't get bored one bit during this album.  I actually wish the radio played more of these types of long songs!  There is a variety of styles on this album.  It's just simply amazing.  I'm a pretty masculine guy and I listen to Justins music proudly without feeling ashamed.  His music is mature pop.  Some of it is good music to make love to also.<br /><br />Track reviews.<br /><br />1.  Pusher Love Girl:  The beginning of this track is cinematic.  The beats and all of the layers are great reminders of Timbalands producing talents.  The chorus has a futuristic sound to it like the songs in \\"Futuresex\\".  Halfway through the song it breaks down and Justin sing raps.  Nice catchy song.<br />2.  Suit and Tie: If you haven't heard this song then you must be living on another planet.  This is forever the classy men anthem now.  Makes me wanna get my suit and tie and just flirt with all the ladies.  Great first single.  Jay Z has the only guest appearance on the album and it's a good one.  Memorable lyrics from both men.  Very catchy!<br />3.  Don't hold the Wall:  Starts off with a Middle Eastern sound like in \\"What goes around...\\".  Some might find this song boring at first but I loved the atmosphere of it right away.  Again there is a breakdown near the end and the song takes a whole new direction.  The first half has a fun Latin sounding beat.  Then it turns into another amazing dance song toward the end.<br />4.  Strawberry Bubblegum:  I think this is my favorite song on the album currently.  The vocals are top notch.  Justins falsetto is infectious.  The first half is so magical.  The beat is chill.  The music is chill.  The chorus is chill.  Such a chill song.  Then the song of course takes another turn toward the end in a great way.  Sounds even better with great earphones.  I can see this released as a single.  I want more people to know this song!  The 8 minutes go by so fast.<br />5.  Tunnel Vision:  The beginning ironically sounds like a Kanye West produced song.  (Kanye sorta dissed JT before this albums release.  But oh well) The vocals have a throwback feeling to Justins N Sync days but only slightly.  Very futuristic and beautiful.  Throughout the songthere is a bass segment that sounds like it could be in the Inception soundtrack.  Really cool.  The final 2 minutes build up the adrenaline in a great way before bringing it back down a bit for a nice ending to the song.<br />6.  Spaceship Coupe:  Another futuristic love making song literally.  The lyrics talk about making love on the moon.  Smooth and weird in a great way.  The production from Timbaland has more cinematic influences.  Beautiful and catchy song with great vocals of course.  There's even a nice guitar solo thrown in there.  Good homage to Prince.  The final 2 minutes of the song slow it down a bit slightly like \\"Set the mood\\" from \\"Futuresex\\" beautifully.  You will have the \\"whoo hoo hoo hooo hooo\\" stuck in your head!<br />7.  That Girl:  The shortest song on the album.  The speaker at the beginning sounds like Andre 3000 a bit. The song even honestly has a slight Andre 3000 feel to it.  Oldschool and the future collide in this song.  Nice feelgood song for guys in love with 'that girl'.  Could be a successful single if released.<br />8.  Let the Groove Get In:  Like many have said, this has a Michael Jackson \\"You wanna be starting something\\" feel to it.  I love it.  Gets me pumped up and hype for some odd reason.  The chanting in the song will bite into your musical soul.  Justin even gives a MJ influenced vocal performance.  Definitely not the first time JT has been compared to MJ.  Great catchy upbeat soulful tune!  There's a great piano segment throughout the song.  A hype beat comes in toward the end and the vocals soar!  Again, the chanting of \\"Are you comfortable / let the groove get in / there there right there\\"  is so infectious!  Timbaland and Timberlake are forever a great duo!<br />9.  Mirrors:  At first I thought this was the corniest song Justin ever made, and it kinda is.  The chorus sounded like Beyonces \\"Halo\\" and Onerepublic sorta.  I love it though.  A different yet familiar sounding JT song.  What's really amazing about this song is the last 3  minutes.  I'll let you experience it for yourself.  Words can't describe how perfect the final 3 minutes are.<br />10.  Blue Ocean Floor:  Great slow relaxing song to end this epic soulful pop masterpiece.  Nice build up with the emotional ambient type music.  Some might need multiple listens to get used to this one.  But you can't deny how great the vocals are.<br /><br />The Target edition came with two bonus tracks:<br />11.  Dress On:  I really liked this song.  It sorta has a \\"Gorillaz\\" vibe to it.  But doesn't fit the context of the album.  Good bonus track.<br />12.  Body Count:  Fun upbeat dance song.  But still not as epic as the rest of the album.  Kind of a sequel to \\"Like I Love You\\" musically.<br />Favorite tracks: Strawberry Bubblegum and Let the Groove Get In.<br />But the entire album is amazing.  This will definitely be on replay for the next few months until JT releases the 20/20 experience 2 later in 2013.<br /><br />For me, this could win the Album of the Year Grammy.  I hope it does.<br />I hope this review was helpful.  Now excuse me as I replay this entire album again!<br />Au Revoir!there is a bass segment that sounds like it could be in the Inception soundtrack.  Really cool.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so good that I read it in a little over 2 days!! Well written and I sort of wish she would write about what happens later in life for Sky and Holder but I guess that is what imagination is for!!
0802473164|5.0|I bought all of these books for my husband to ready and finally after nine years of doing nothing for me he started doing little things and it really makes a difference to me.
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|On the bright side, at least we didn't have to watch Matthew get killed as a &#34;Christmas Special&#34; like the Brits did.
0802473156|5.0|I whole-kindheartedly recommend these Gary Chapman books for all people.  Understanding others and how to tune your actions into individuals is incredibly valuable for healthy relationships.

B003MYYJD0|5.0|This watch is awesome. It's big and beautiful. But most of all its comfortable. The accuracy is second to none. If I had just one watch, I would keep this one.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Can't get enough of this album. Each song is an absolute pop masterpiece, with multiple time shifts key changes and the like.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This band is a breath of fresh air for heavy rock/metal. Every facet of this band sounds incredible, The sound of this band is like Pantera had a threesome with Disturbed and Linkin Park and this is the result.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book was as magical as the secret garden itself<br />I couldn't believe how much I loved it.<br />My mom picked it out and I swear I'm reading everything she puts in font of me.I recommend this book to everyone who is looking for a sweet story.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this game is awsome I like it because it is only a buck and it is fun I bought it and fell in love it is amazing and I would recommend you to buy it now while it is still on sale no lie pure awsomeness.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|If you have any other games on your Kindle I recommend removing them when you install this one.  You won't be playing anything else.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome like all the other books by Jeff but it was really short. I think he should write a long book for once
B005COO1X6|5.0|Great little read! I was captivated from start to finish. Got the old familiar Buzz of anticipation I always expect from The Master. Ahhh. I'm still smiling.
B00009R86L|1.0|I used this shoulder pad for four (count 'em, 4) days and the rubber part separated from the black part. Actually, it had already begun to come apart in the package. I had one of these in the 90's and it lasted quite a while. I'm not sure what kind of glue they're using on these nowadays, but it's worthless. I should have sent it back right away, now I'm stuck with it. Maybe I'll see what type of glue/epoxy/adhesive is best for gluing quasi-foam rubber to quasi-leathery-plastic stuff and see if I can fix it.<br /><br />Maybe you'll have better luck with yours than I did. Good luck.
0307951529|1.0|I checked this book out from the library before purchasing and I was very relieved I did not buy it.  This book gives endless examples, however it does not inform you of the process before saying things like \\"and now Kyle makes $90,000 a year.\\"  He simply jumps to that part tells you what the person does and how much money they make.  I notice the examples were usually followed by the person getting fired or laid off and then the person went on some extravagant vacation where they decided that they were going to start up this random business. They suddenly update their websites and magic they make thousands that same day!  There is so much more that happens before this but he only informs the reader of when they were fired and that they went on some vacation and voila they now make an awesome living.  I stopped reading some chapters and fast forwarded only to find the same thing over and over. I'm sorry but how did these people have money to travel the world and then decide what their passion was.  They must of had a rich parent or something to support them.  Whenever you already have money it is easy to take that risk than when you give up everything you have worked so hard for to make your dream happen.  I really wanted to see helpful information of the process, the legalities, and how they upkeep that success. This book offers none of that and I may have missed something but it is not informative at all. I would say if anything it could be a motivation type book offering you a great deal of examples of the happiness of others. As far as this being a helpful book for someone who wants to start their own business, that it is not.

B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|I had 4 of the movies on DVD, but when we upgraded our TV to a large flat screen we also invested in a Blu-ray player.  We've had it a year and only had 1 other movie (Avatar).  Catching some of the movies on a cable channel over the weekend lead me to ask myself &#34;why don't you just buy the Blu-ray disks&#34;?  And boy am I glad I did!  I just got the set last night and the clarity is amazing.  Great price for the entire set plus lots of bonus features.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This version is quite good for tablets. Tiles and games are well viewed with no bleeding on the outer edges. There are quite a lot of different versions of games with an increasing amount of tiles as you work your way your way through the progression..
B006LSZECO|5.0|This wasn't what I expected but it was so good. A real page turner. I would definitely recommend this one!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|cant finish them they freeze up or make no Spence or I buy a game and 20 minutes later. om done<br />with it. This game when I bought there was still a lot of the game left.The graphics are good.the pictures are good.I wish the game kept going.
0470474874|4.0|Overall a good manual for Excel. However, specifics for some higher funcions Excel are limited. It was a good purchase for the price.
0316077046|5.0|This book was great!  This author has a great imagination.  Makes you feel like you were really there with Ethan and Lena going through their stuggles with them.
B000SW2F8K|2.0|If Disney wanted to make a movie for grownups but couldn't let go of it's child like lack of mature experience, Woman on Top might be the result.<br /><br />What could have been a cute, romantic film takes several confusing turns. Not confusing as to plot, but The first two jokes early on as the movie sets its tone are cringe worthy add in a Seinfeldesque fantasy scene of hundreds of people following the woman like the pied piper.<br /><br />No drama following a marital split and major move to a new country..oh just grab a plane and move to the US. (guess you're not leaving any friends or life behind? Perhaps emotional amnesia?)<br /><br />Become an American celebrity no culture shock, clearly the movie doesn't get any legs till near the end. If the childish fantasy scenes were left out because they do not work against a semi naked, sensually implied and dressed backdrop (think 9 1/2 weeks with raggedy ann and andy) this movie clearly has no idea what it wants to be.<br /><br />There are some good scenes, eye candy for both sexes and a nice soundtrack. A strong supporting performance by Harold Perrineau Jr often carried the weaker scenes.<br /><br />I did watch the whole movie, the ending was nice but if the makers stuck to one theme.. instead of ruining with dumb insipid comedy and too much childish silliness which didn't match or complement the very naked ending, clearly they didn't think this through. It's just a mess.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|I really enjoy this soundtrack. It makes good study music and workout music for me.  I suggest you listen to it before you buy.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I paid for this and it won't download. Very upsetting !<br />It tells me there was an error and to retry. I have tried at least 4 times now. TIME to get refunded and move on. I am very disappointed.<br /><br />I TAKE IT ALL BACK, FOR SOME REASON MY GAME DECIDED TO DOWNLOAD THE NEXT DAY AND IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT! I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I like this book because of the positive uplifting character devolopment. Although the Victoria had a tough break in life, she gradually found herself and a family.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was a good book I loved it it is now one of my favorite books there were a few spelling and civilization problems but I really liked the book.

B009J2VQSK|1.0|Only one or two tracks that were to my liking.Disappointed. Not what I thought I was getting. Loved the movie
B006LSZECO|5.0|People are saying they didn't like the ending to this book.  I agree it wasn't \\"satisfying\\" but it was believable.  This plot was so unbelievable that it was believable.  Aren't the best true stories always the things that we never would have been able to imagine?  This book kept me totally enthralled. If you want something predictable read something else.  I think this will make a great movie!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Beautiful Darkness is a great book filled with great action and romance it is a book everyone should read at least once in there live time
B0039HR5QS|5.0|1. Don't miss the beginning<br />2. I loved the plot with us learning as Redford's \\"Condor\\" is learning. He is just an analyst, but with an uncanny feel for field craft<br />3. This movie could be made today with some updating of the technology like an iPhone and use of GPS and the Internet.<br />4. If you enjoyed \\"Enemy of the State,\\" you will enjoy this too.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Controls are ok, but the rest of the game is boring and pointless.  I was instantly bored with the game, which is unusual.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love my kindle.... I have had some issues. I had to uninstall it from my tablet and reinstall it.. It would not allow me to get into the books.  It kept telling me that y password was invalid.  It was just a fault with the app.  I uninstalled it, put it back on my tablet and I have had no other issues with it.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I liked very much but I prefer when Andrea sings old fashion songs ,probably because I am an older person.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|I thought this movie hit very close to home for high school life.  I work a school setting and see similar stories unfold every day.  Rumors get started very easily.  I thought it funny and that Stone did a good job with it.  I don't think it received enough credit.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|It's ok simply<br /> Lol and funny I mean it it is not like  diary of a wimpy kid but stillborn
B008DKBPTO|5.0|I love Timbuk2 products, and as a native of San Francisco, I always will.<br /><br />I got this for my girlfriend's Kindle Paperwhite as a stocking stuffer. It fits the Paperwhite perfectly and seems to offer a good amount of protection. Some people have complained about the red interior staining their readers, but the Paperwhite is black, so I can't verify any of that.<br /><br />She likes the pattern and I like the fact that it's built out of Timbuk2's bulletproof fabrics. No doubt this will last the life of her Paperwhite, and if it fits the next generation of Kindle readers, my girlfriend likes it enough to keep it around for a lifetime!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I rated it this because it is excellent and enjoyable. I liked it very much because its challenging. Yes I would recommended to all that like to play a super experiece.
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|It seems the better looking you are the shorter your life expectancy is in Downton. Season finale was grim and predictable.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I shows this rated because it is a great game. I like it because it is a good it test your abiltiy to gain a good score. and yes  I would recommended to because it is a good past time and it is just super.
1451675046|4.0|Richard Dawkins's great gift is the ability to explain even the most complex scientific principles with such crystal clarity that you not only understand them, you feel as if you can see them at work before your very eyes. This is no less the case in &#34;The Magic of Reality.&#34; His elegant prose paints pictures with words. This book, however, unlike his previous work, does not seem intended for those with much more than a layperson's understanding of science. Dawkins covers subjects ranging from genetics and evolution to physics, the big bang, and the theory of an expanding universe, and virtually any reader is likely to encounter some information in the book that's new to them, but if you are well-versed in the sciences, as much of Dawkins's audience is bound to be, you probably won't find MUCH new information. Dawkins goes to the trouble to explain what he means by a &#34;thought experiment,&#34; for instance, leading me to believe that the book was intended for those with essentially no understanding of any of the sciences. In fact, an older child with an interest in science should be able to fully understand and enjoy everything in this book. However, even if you learn nothing new from it, if you are a fan of Dawkins, this book will not disappoint. It is a quick, light, and delightful read.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A bit long and convoluted in toward the end but entertaining. I still recommend as it is funny to read about an old dude getting out in the world and making waves. It got silly but was still kind of fun.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|I'm not gonna sugar coat this review, and Amazon had better not delete it. Since the Grammy's, we have been inundated  with countless hype of \\"Justin's upcoming album.\\" This coincides with his appearances on SNL, commercials, etc. I'll be brutally honest. It sucks and there's nothing to write home about it. Yes, he has a nice, smooth voice. This has been proven before with FutureSex/LoveSounds album. It's nothing that hasn't been heard before. Granted, the arrangements over this new record seem to be different and think outside the box, but it's outside in an area that's about as blase' and boring as an unemployment line.<br /><br />All of the songs for the most part sound the same. The only one that stood out to me was \\"Blue Ocean Floor,\\" with the reversed piano playing throughout. But if I want to hear a hip song using reverse fx, I'd go put on \\"Paul Revere\\" by the Beastie Boys. The last song I heard on the deluxe version was \\"Body Count,\\" which is reminiscent of your typical Timbaland production--and last time I checked it wasn't 2007 anymore. I just don't know. I previewed this album with hopes of another \\"Sexy Back\\" (which I absolutely HATED but it grew on me), but the songs all fall short.<br /><br />Maybe he's just come of age, and trying to appeal to a different market. I think he'd fair well as a contemporary jazz/blues singer...like Harry Connick Jr. Mature album? Yes. Any memorable pop hits, #1 potential?? Absolutely NOT.<br /><br />Sadly, the fans and public will yet again have the sheets pulled over their eyes, thinking this is the definitive album of 2013. All because of the massive hype and promotion circulating around it. I remember another album years ago, that had much hype surrounding IT, and many songs cracked the Top 10 charts. And the singer had a smooth, memorable voice as well. It was Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller.\\" At least Michael delivered on the hype.<br /><br />\\"20/20 Experience\\" is DEFINITELY no \\"Thriller.\\"

B00000K3D4|5.0|Great movie... a favorite of mine from childhood. It was great to share with my kids and kind of funny that during an episode of sibling rivalry I get to hear how they wish the goblin king would take the other away... HILARIOUS
B0058EBNAO|5.0|i wish it gave longer radar history, but i love that the short history takes only moments to load, so i'm still happy.  the radar is simply wonderful.  the 10 day is really helpful.  the 24 with sunrise and notifications is helpful.  the user interface is the best.  i recommend this app!  i have had my phone replaced a couple times, and it is hard to recover this app, but the developers sent me a link with key so that i can easily download it.  these developers are are wonderful to their customers.
B008TTPQXA|3.0|This was an interesting book. It was a bit long on the description of the experience that the author said cannot be satisfactorily described. It was strong in the Appendix on relating medical possibilities with that experience. I would have preferred a more  scientific approach throughout.
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|Who would have known that a musician named Rodriguez from Detroit was a top selling artist in South Africa, providing voice to a movement during apartheid? Certainly not the artist himself. He labored in obscurity for decades, living in the same home in Detroit for 40 years, while becoming a mythological figure to fans in South Africa. This film tells his story and brings it full circle, showing concert footage of Rodriguez performing triumphantly for large audiences in South Africa who sang along. It is a satisfying movie that unveils a fine artist.
B008D37J6O|5.0|Plays a ton of different formats and gives you a lot of options. Well planned. It will work without it but allows much customization. No extras needed. Easy to use. Like apps should be!
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch Walk Off The Earth in southern California last fall and I was absolutely blown away. Their wide range of musical talent along with their amazing stage presence truly sets them aside from the majority of today's bands. The band's cover of the Gotye song \\"Somebody That I Used To know\\" is considered by most to be superior to the original version. WOTE is fun band with a very unique musical style and a wide range of vocals. The voice of Sarah Blackwood alone is worth purchasing this album. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD today. You will not be disappointed.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I'm a fan of the series Daria and this set includes episodes (movies)' Is it Fall yet?' and 'Is it College Yet?' The package was delivered timely and in awesome condition.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Nice watch,This the watch that i have been looking for wish i had gone to amazon first.I had bought a watch on e-bay first.
B006GKHE6G|3.0|When I down loaded this to my kids Nabi it won't let them steer by tilting the tablet like it did in the demo version. I tried to change the setting but no luck so I had to switch it to a different style of controls so it would work. Fix this big and ill give it 5 stars. Fun game if it works.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I'm never sure if I'm supposed to be rating the movie itself or the quality of the product, so I will try to address both. This has always been one of my favorite Disney movies from my childhood and watching it again, it is still very funny. The characters interactions are funny and sentimental when they need to be. The product itself was new and in good condition upon arrival and I had no problem playing the DVD on my laptop. I would recommend this movie to any age group!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Even if you disagree with the premise behind the book, this is worthwhile reading.  His earlier book on the same subject was heavily scientific.  This book makes a good introdution to that one and both should be read even if you disagree with his findings.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I originally watched this movie when it came out and I wasn't sure if I would still like it, but I think it is even funnier now. The plot is funny and so are all of the characters! I would definitely recommend this as a good family movie. The product itself was in great/new condition upon arrival and played just fine on my laptop.

B000F8O35U|4.0|I purchased this DVD for my granddaughter for Christmas. Her mom forgot about the gift and remembered it this weekend (March 2013) and decided they would watch the DVD. When she opened the package the DVD was damaged and it would not play.<br /><br />I contacted the seller through Amazon.com and the seller was quick to reply. They issued me a full credit (including shipping). Unfortunately because the DVD is no longer availabe in their stock they were not able to send me a replacement. I did not have to return the damaged DVD.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with the response from from the seller.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Hours turn into mins playing this game I'm hooked simple and fun recomend to anyone looking to past the time without going broke ... only draw back it can be a little slow on a tablet once you build a lot.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Seamless, gorgeous, elegant. Customize to taste, sit back, enjoy. This app is one big reason to do the tablet thing. I find it necessary every darn day. Check out Pulse, too.
B004KZOXJA|5.0|I just re-read this book to refresh my memory now that the third in the series has come out, and I think I enjoyed this one even more the second time round. Lena is an exceptional main character. Her transformation throughout the book is executed brilliantly. Oliver has real skill in this area - Before I Fall's main character changes so much throughout the story, and Oliver shows that brilliance wasn't a fluke by repeating it here in Delirium, with an entirely different character and plot. In less adept hands, many of Lena's decisions would seem unrealistic, especially given her rule-follower personality, but Oliver provides rationalisations that make Lena's choices totally believable.<br /><br />The main male character, Alex, would melt any girl's heart. Poor Lena didn't stand a chance. He may even be slightly too perfect to be realistic, but I can't say that bothered me when reading.<br /><br />The world building of this dystopian society is also enthralling. We learn about the world through Lena's eyes, who completely believes that love is a disease and can't wait to be cured - at least in the beginning. As the story unfolds and her entire belief system is challenged, some thought-provoking concepts are raised, such as: what is more dangerous, anger or apathy? What is more important, love or duty? An added touch that I really liked was excerpts from the rewritten bible, for example:<br /><br />The devil stole into the Garden of Eden. He carried with him the disease - amor delirium nervosa - in the form of a seed. It grew and flowered into a magnificent apple tree, which bore apples as bright as blood.<br /><br />I only had two qualms with this story, one close to the beginning and one close to the end. [The first was Lena's reaction to seeing Alex on the observation deck during her evaluation. Considering she is wearing a see-through gown with no bra and has been segregated from boys her entire life, I felt she would have been mortified at him seeing her so exposed, even if it was at a distance. There's no hint of embarrassment from her, and that didn't ring true for me.<br /><br />The second issue, which is more of a biggie, I'm not going to explain because it's too much of a spoiler. I'll simply say that it was a reasonably significant plot point that seemed quite unrealistic to me.<br /><br />Despite these two issues, I still loved the story overall, which is why I give it 4.5 stars. The ending left me stunned and breathless (both times I read it!), and I had to get my hands on Pandemonium, the second book in the series, to find out what happened for Lena next.<br /><br />Favourite quotes:<br /><br />Sometimes I feel as though there are two me's, one coasting directly on top of the other: the superficial me, who nods when she's supposed to nod and says what she's supposed to say, and some other, deeper part, the part that worries and dreams and says 'Grey.' Most of the time they move along in sync and I hardly notice the split, but sometimes it feels as though I'm two whole different people and I could rip apart at any second.<br /><br />In that second it really hits me how deep and complex the lies are, how they run through Portland like sewers, backing up into everything, filling the city with stench: the whole city built and constructed within a perimeter of lies.<br /><br />They say the cure is about happiness, but I understand now that it isn't, and it never was. It's about fear: fear of pain, fear of hurt, fear, fear, fear - a blind animal existence, bumping between walls, shuffling between ever-narrowing hallways, terrified and dull and stupid. ... life isn't life if you just float through it. I know that the whole point - the only point - is to find the things that matter, and hold on to them, and refuse to let them go.
B003IKMR0U|3.0|This is a fun, quick game. It really focuses more on your capacity for statistical reasoning as it crutches heavily on pushing your luck against probability. Play is simple: there are 13 dice in the set. Each die features brain, shotgun blast, and footprint sides ( in varying ratios, some dice feature more of one result than the others) A player rolls 3 of the dice at a time, keeping &#34;brain&#34; and &#34;shotgun blast&#34; results, and re-rolling &#34;footprint&#34; results (always rolling three dice). The player continues until they call it quits and tally their brain count for that round, or roll a total of three blasts in a round (losing their brains for that round). The dice then pass to the next player, and the game continues as such until a player banks 13 or more total brains. At that point, the final round begins and all other players must break that players score to win. Obviously, the winner is the single player with the highest total brain count at or above 13.<br /><br />It will take you 45 seconds to learn this game, and almost 5 times as long to play a game between 2 people. It generates some pretty choice conversation during game play as well if your friends are as fun as mine. :-)<br /><br />There's not much strategy beyond probability, and obviously its playability is held in check by its simplicity,  but its good fun. great for road trips, painful waits, and i betcha there's a drinking game or two hidden in here somewhere....<br /><br />Goes best with the Zombie Dice : Double Feature expansion pack.
B0012QRPU4|1.0|Not how it's meant to be viewed, don't get short changed on this show.<br />Such a great season and after I saw what Amazon did to the first episode I feel like finding a better place to watch online.
8876250441|5.0|Synopsis: Bella Swan, a normal young adult, and Edward Cullen, a vampire, fall in love and soon get married. They then had a baby by accident and didn't know how it would come out. During the pregnancy, the baby was sucking all of Bella's blood and she was very close to dying. When she was giving birth to her child she died. Edward then had to bite her to make her come back to life even though he didn't want her to become a vampire, but it was his only choice. Bella then came back to life as a vampire and was a new born so it was very difficult to control her. Then her fellow friend, Jacob, was a werewolf and he imprinted on the baby, Renesmee. The volturi heard about the human/vampire baby that Bella had given birth to. They also heard that the baby could put them in danger. A war is starting because of rumors and the Cullens get as many vampires as they know to help them and prove to them that Renesmee is not an immortal child just half human and half vampire.<br /> The Cullens are a nice family who will risk their lives to help others. Edward also protects Bells just to make sure she is always safe. Jacob is a friend and has fallen in love with Renesmee. Carlisle and Esme are the parents of Edward. Jasper, Alice, Rosalie, and Emmett are Edward's \\"brothers and sisters\\" who are always helping Bella since she is new to the family.<br /> Book Rating= 10<br /> This book was really good because of all the action and how realistically the author wrote it. The lovely romance Bella and Edward have in this story is so wonderful. It made me laugh, cry, think, but it never made you want to stop reading. It gave such description and detail that no other book has.

B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|There are very few games that can hold my attention for any real amount of time. Especially these goofy little games created for your phone or tablet device, but Osmos HD has some very interesting qualities. It's a puzzle game yet it doesn't look like one. It's kind of an action game but it doesn't feel like one. It's almost hypnotic with it's spacey music and flowing orbs.<br /><br />I like it!

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo is a significant film. The most important part of the film is the beginning. In the very beginning of the film, before any action starts,  the narration gives an unvarnished, brief synopsis of Iranian history for the last sixty years. The narration relates how the elected government of Mohammed Mossadegh was overthrown by American and British interests following the nationalization of Iran's oil industry. The narration also relates how the Shah of Iran was installed at the behest of the same governments, and how the Iranian peoples were violently oppressed by SAVAC, the Shah's secret police. For people in the Progressive Community this knowledge is well known and is historically undisputed. This knowledge was certainly not know by the vast majority of people outside of Iran, and most certainly not known to American citizens at the time of the Iranian Hostage Crisis. Bringing this knowledge to the open as Argo has done was a bold, if somewhat academic, move, designed to foster some degree of understanding to a misunderstood country.<br /><br />While the beginning was promising, the movie quickly degenerates into a standard Hollywood political thriller. A good thriller, but one which drowns out, unfortunately, the attempt at understanding the mentality of nation which was so greatly wronged by Western powers. While the movie attempts to explain a previously unknown historical background of an important country, that message is trivialized by what is really a standard Hollywood thriller.<br /><br />This movie accurately depicts the atmosphere in Teheran during the overthrow of the Shah. Speaking as someone who was passing through Teheran as a tourist on the way to India, while the movie goes a long way in giving a snapshot of the city at the time, the reality was much, much worse. Teheran  was very much a city caught in the grips of great tension, apprehension and revolutionary zeal.<br /><br />The movies probably more accurately portrays the vagaries of life in the intelligence community. A telling portion of the movie is at the last portion of the film where Mendez (Afflect) is informed that he is about to receive the highest award in recognition of his work in the operation. Mendez informs his chief that he is not available on the date appointed for the ceremony. It really didn't matter, the chief indicates. Because Mendez did not officially participate in the operation which was highly confidential, indeed, since the operation did not officially exist, he would have to return the medal anyway. Such is the surreal world of intelligence work.<br /><br />Unsettling, but not surprising considering the other entrants for best picture in 2013 (Zero Dark Thirty), is the degree to which the spy agencies work hand in glove with Hollywood. The entire operation which engineered the release of the embassy workers depicted in the film was the result of the real-life participation of Hollywood producers, represented by the actors Alan Arkin and John Goodman.<br /><br />All things being equal, this movie conveys a better message than Zero Dark Thirty, which appears to have been scripted by the Defense Department. If the movie viewing public does not get mesmerized by the standard Hollywood shtick which is undeniably present in the film, Argo will go a long way towards creating understanding between this country and Iran.he intelligence community.

B003ZZAXFO|5.0|The 3rd Gabriel solo album sounds like it comes from another planet practically, after the stylistic indecision and meandering of the first two. The earlier albums are worthwhile, but suddenly Gabriel really sounds like he is on creative fire from start to finish. New studio technology and new approaches to percussion in particular enter into the mix (with a hat tip to former Genesis bandmate Phil Collins who plays on much of the album), and some of his greatest and most lasting music appears here.<br /><br />It's a dark album, with fairly pronounced social and political commentary, but is still highly accessible and full of both exciting experimentation and top-notch rock songwriting.

B003UBTX6S|4.0|I have now read the second of what appears to be a four book series and I am hooked bad. I can not wait to read the next book because I`m sure it will be as wonderful as this book was. I really enjoy the story and it is so very exciting. I really can not wait to read more. I am so happy to be reading these books now because I don't think I could have waited for next one to be written at the time. I just stared the first book a couple of weeks ago and I will get the third today.
B00BLF9FOK|3.0|I remember weeks ago seeing back-to-back trailers for this film and Sylvester Stallone's \\"Bullet to the Head.\\" Sly's film looked ridiculous and stupid, not to mention he is after thugs that took his daughter. How original. But then Arnold's movie trailer comes on and it seems pretty clear we are going to get good guys and bad guys in an unlikely shoot-out, but damn if it doesn't look like fun. And damn if it isn't.<br /><br />Schwarzenegger plays Sheriff Ray Owens, a small town cop on the Arizona-Mexico border. Coming his way from Las Vegas is an escaped cartel boss (Eduardo Noriega) in a souped-up Corvette ZR-1. In a ridiculous and convoluted scenario, this occurs during a transfer supervised by FBI agent John Bannister played by Forest Whitaker in a performance about as lame as his character's management of the transfer. Maybe Whitaker just couldn't understand director Jee-woon Kim's instructions.<br /><br />The fun really starts when Cortez (Noriega) approaches the border town. You see Cortez is also a professional race car driver. Think about it. In an earlier set up, Cortez has sent a cadre of henchmen ahead to prepare a portable bridge over a ravine into Mexico. Since everyone is out of town at a football game, the sheriff will have to defend their border with an out-of-shape deputy (Luis Guzman), another pair of deputies new to the job (Zach Gilford and Jaimie Alexander), the town drunk/ Iraq War veteran (Rodrigo Santoro) and town gadfly (Johnny Knoxville).<br /><br />Arnold is at his self-deprecating best as the tired veteran of the L. A. police force just looking for a little quiet time. The film is exactly what it promises, nothing more. It's fun.

B00BNWWVFG|4.0|Oh yeah, I like this movie. For my money, Steven Soderbergh is one of our best directors in terms of quality and versatility. He manages to make genre-focused B-like films (\\"Haywire\\") more A-like. Here he takes a mystery-thriller that could have been just lurid in tone and makes it lurid with Hitchcock style.<br /><br />Rooney Mara convincingly plays Emily Taylor, the wife of a convicted white collar criminal (Channing Tatum) who is just released from prison for insider trading. Trying to get their lives back together is difficult as Emily seems to be drifting into depression to the point of trying to kill herself. Seen in the hospital ER by a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) Emily is released on the condition she seeks regular treatment. She agrees.<br /><br />After trying several prescriptions that she doesn't like for various reasons, she finds one that seemingly works wonders. She's happy, her sex drive improves, her husband is happy and things appear to be progressing. Emily is exposed to one side effect however. She sleepwalks. During one of these episodes, tragedy ensues and Emily is arrested. But who is to blame? Emily, the drug manufacturer or the doctor (Banks) who prescribed it?<br /><br />A previous shrink (excellent Catherine Zeta-Jones) Emily had seen while her husband was in prison re-enters the picture as a collaborator with Dr. Banks. Soderbergh and his \\"Contagion\\" scriptwriter, Scott Z. Burns concoct a wonderful mystery complete with sharp directional turns. See it.
0385349947|2.0|This book assumes all women want to be high level executives or CEOS.  Let me be the one to tell you that that simply is not true.<br /><br />I work and have worked with hundreds of women, and I would say 5% ever aspire to be the CEO.  Why?  Because when you are a CEO your mind has be on 24/7.  You never really leave work.  You never stop thinking of work.  You are your job.<br /><br />Most of the women I know want a family and a good job, and that's exactly what they have.  Nothing is keeping them from the top tiers of their company more than their complete lack of desire to be there.<br /><br />For the 5% of women that want to rule the world, this book is a great read.  Otherwise skip it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book. It just grabs you and never lets you go, loved it ! Movie was great too !
B00B193IS0|5.0|I like this album very much. Billy Bragg recorded it with producer Joe Henry in Pasadena with a fine American band including pedal steel, which means his sound is a very long way from the angry young man that I first heard in the late 70s, singing and playing solo through a slightly distorted amplifier from the back of a van at a protest rally. This is musically and often lyrically much more mellow, but the old passions are still there and it's an album with real substance.<br /><br />Overall, there is an Americana-ish feel to the disc, although it is quite varied: for example, when I first heard the opening January Song I thought immediately of Pentangle, and Chasing Rainbows (for me, the only slightly weak track) is an attempt at an out-and-out Country song. The political statements are still there, just dressed in more laid-back clothes. Woody Guthrie again gets moving and intelligent treatment with a great version of I Ain't Got No Home - which remains astonishingly pertinent today - and the original songs are very good, too. For example, in No One Knows Nothing Anymore we get the line, \\"What happens when the markets drop?....\\" which is classic Billy Bragg, as is \\"How can a man be strong/If he can't even lift up the telephone and say he's wrong?\\" in the lovely Swallow My Pride, and the title of There Will Be A Reckoning speaks for itself.<br /><br />It's a lovely album to listen to. It is tuneful, very well played and produced and features wearier, softer vocals from Billy Bragg than his earlier material, but his old commitments remain strong and there is real heart and sincerity here. Don't expect Life's A Riot or Talking With the Taxman, but I think it's an excellent album and it's warmly recommended.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I not much at rating / reviewing movies. I'm not that much captivated by the plot, but the kids seem to like it. lots of scenery and special effects
B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|I came to this album as a Phosphorescent novice on the recommendation of a friend. I have plainly been missing out by not hearing him sooner.<br /><br />I'm not in a position to compare this to other Phosphorescent albums, but I think Muchacho is a very good album indeed, with thoughtful, haunting and intelligent songs, beautifully arranged and - in their idiosyncratic way - very well sung. The instrumental is a rich, electronic and very beautiful. There is a mixture of the mournful and the hopeful here, and a mixture of styles, too, held together by the slightly cracked, mixed-back and multi-tracked vocals which I found very expressive and affecting.<br /><br />I think that there are some things about this album which remind me of Leonard Cohen. Now, I know it sounds absolutely nothing like a Cohen album, but Matthew Houck has the same ability to write a straightforward but lovely tune and to put things into extremely evocative, sometimes elusive words. The brilliant Muchacho's Tune is a good example - haunting, self-excoriating and in search of redemption. I don't want to push the comparison too far because things like the vocals and overall sound here and on Old Ideas, for example, couldn't be more different but I do think he shares some of Cohen's genius for conjuring insight and feeling in a song. I mean that as the highest praise.<br /><br />This was a surprising and delightful discovery for me, and I'm now off to seek out some of Phosphorescent's other work. It's a really fine album and warmly recommended.

Reversed my type 2 diabetes, and educated me on the goodness of the &#34;right&#34; foods for our bodies!

1589949811|4.0|I'm a serious board gamer who likes complicated games (Twilight Imperium), and my wife is less serious and prefers games such as Shadows Over Camelot and Settlers of Catan. We are  board game people without a large number of board game friends. It is like pulling teeth to get even a simple Settlers group to all play. (The woes of being young adults with young children, I guess.) This game fills a great hole in our gaming time because my wife and I can just grab it and go, and both enjoy the gameplay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The challenge level after the first quest is high, and you cannot expect a free victory each time. (Note, there is an element of luck to how difficult a mission is, each mission can swing from moderate to player-breakingly hard.)<br />The mechanics of resource generation and combat all work well enough to be fun.<br />Two player cooperative games are in short supply and this one fills that niche very well.<br />The pieces all feel substantial enough to play over and over, and the cards look good.<br />The level of complication isn't so high that it will scare off less hardcore gamers.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The starter set does not give you a real deck building experience due to a dearth of certain cards. A lot of people mention having to buy a second set, not for 3-4 player but just so they can build the starter decks they want. A better solution involves a scanner, color printer, regular playing cards, and card sleeves, but still, this is a pain in the butt. The starter isn't overly costly but I'd like 3 of every card in the starter. The pain to this Con lessens when you start playing the mission packs, and vanishes entirely pretty quick.<br />The first player swapping is a pain to keep track of at the pace I play.<br />The swinginess of the 2nd and 3rd mission can be frustrating, especially with just the starter decks. It DOES take some luck to win with the starter decks.<br />The sequence of play can be a little overworked, we play with the cheat sheet open even though we are both experienced at this game.<br /><br />Overall, if you have a game friend and you're looking for a quick, good, two player co-op game that has plenty of room to grow, pick this one.t sheet open even though we are both experienced at this game.<br /><br />Overall, if you have a game friend and you're looking for a quick, good, two player co-op game that has plenty of room to grow, pick this one.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Really impressed with the CD. This CD is going to be huge and I'm sure a big player at the Grammy's next year.<br /><br />Even more so, I'm very impressed with the Service and Price I received from Amazon.com. When they say you will bet the Low Price, they mean it. I had the Low Price Guarantee with my Pre-Order and getting the refund when the price went down was an extremely easy process. I'm so glad that we are PRIME members, because I love getting the product fast!<br /><br />Way to go JT!

B009E3EXMU|5.0|Like a phoenix rising from the ashes of the tragedy that ended the first generation of Led Zeppelin, this performance shines brilliantly.  I hope they manage to put the show back on the road one more time while they still can.  Like others, I could have done without the fast camera switches, but it's a small thing really.<br /><br />I keep asking myself \\"Which group/performer/artist of today's generation would want to follow them on-stage?\\"  I can only think of a few who would be so bold as to even consider it.  None, I'm afraid, would.  Nor should they.<br /><br />Bravo...!!!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I never paid much attention to Michael's musical genius, but this behind the scene documentary of his rehearsals, and production of This Is It is breathtaking to watch.<br /><br />Michael's passion for his art comes through as well as his love for others. It is a wonderful presentationb to his life and art.  Had this documentary not been produced, I probably would have never known how much Michael was gifted in all areas of music and dance.

B0050N8N0Q|5.0|so different from other music out there on radio now, yet I had no idea how many songs on this album I had heard before.  probably in stores?  amazing album.  underrated.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice job. My kids enjoyed this game. Houses act real and are beautiful. This free game is so worth it.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|I gave it 3 stars, based on the fact I enjoy the original, but I can't load the premium version, and assume the game is fine if you can load it!  I have and enjoy the original version of this game, and was looking forward to playing the \\"premium\\" version.  I tried to load it onto my Kindle Fire 8.9, but kept getting error messages.  Tried 5 times, even rebooted the Fire, to no avail.

1451638450|5.0|All the teasing glimpses of Vorpatril from the Miles Vorkosigan stories gave the impression of a rather vague, self-absorbed individual. Turns out he is one who deliberately stays under the radar for what seems to be good reason.  Thanks to Ms Bujold for exploring an old character and making him new. Who knows? He might be grist for a new branch in the timeline.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|My spouse is a fan of the genre and appreciated this one for his collection.  He will watch it again and again.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|'Lawrence of Arabia'one of the finest films ever made has withstood the greatest test of all, time. As beautiful today as ever and improved technology has certainly made this possible. Although not without a couple caveats. With CGI quickly moving into the drivers seat of the 'epic part' of cinema it is no longer feasible monetarily or otherwise to make movies of this magnitude. This and the overwhelming evidence that physical media is quickly being replaced with streamed 0's and 1's in a more timely manner than even the big thinkers could have imagined makes in my opinion the [[ASIN:B0017O1MIM Lawrence of Arabia (50th Anniversary Collector's Edition ]]  a must own for all lovers of great cinema, taken from time and place that will always be remembered.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Maggie Smith is superb.  then entire cast is great and I have enjoyed this series.  We are looking forward to more...
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I am leaving this review before I finish the game since the game keeps prompting me. Game play is good &amp; it runs well on my kindle fire but it can be a bit confusing. I am playing on the hardest version and it is lasting longer than most because I am not always sure what to do so that could be good. Not quite worth $4.99 but what can you do? Go with it! Not the worst Ive played!
B00003JRCQ|3.0|If you enjoy English period dramas this one is very good.  In the same vein as others of this time period.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|If you play this game on the harder level you will be able to complete it. The puzzles are fun and there was only one that I had to use the help button. Nice graphics and good hidden objects. It was a little short for the price but was not aggregating.  It worked great on the kindle fire.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am definitely a fan of the Masterpiece series.  Will look forward to Season 4!!  Wish it ran more frequently!!
B009Z5975A|5.0|I love all of these movies and wanted to show them to my kids. They came very fast and the picture quality is great. If you have never watched these movies they will give you a good laugh.
B0092SPYQG|3.0|the track 'where did the angels go' is really good, but the rest are weak by comparison. i'd recommend previewing the album and just picking the tracks you like because, as usual, papa roach is good, but not great.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book has changed the way I view life. I haven't seen the movie, and now that I've read the the book I don't want to. Watching the movie of a book changes the way I see the books. This made me realize that nothing is what it seems. Everyone has a story behind a story. I will never look at another person assuming I know anything about them .

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I've read all of the Percy Jackson related books by rick riordan and I've enjoyed all of them. I just wish that the House of Hades book would come sooner!

B004CURZFC|4.0|Pleasantly enjoyable; great graphics.  Will watch again with grandchildren.  Cheaper to purchase than taking entire family to theatre.  Costs $18 for 1 adult at IMAX 3d.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|It would show them in thier classic boats and cars, classic cottages driving incredible cars going to their lawyers offices to find ways to support less taxes on the rich and higher for the poor. Showing their house help downtrodden and stealing things under camera survelance. You know typical life of Rich Americans.
B006RUJST6|3.0|Managed to get through the entire book so it wasn't THAT bad.. but it kind of wanders pointlessly to a rather abrupt and easy conclusion. Loose ends all wrapped up neatly in a couple pages. Just like real life....
B008B68J2G|4.0|My 7 & 5 year old daughters love Monster High.  They have tons of dolls as well as the [[ASIN:B007ADIRDM Monster High Coffin Bean and Clawdeen Wolf Doll Playset]] and I figured this would be a great addition for them. It's easy to put together but has tons of little tiny pieces that are easily misplaced or sucked into a vacuum.  However, the girls absolutely love this and usually have their dolls set up between this & the Coffin Bean.

1451629184|5.0|This book has made me aware to another side of the world that we have to live in everyday. it's just disturbing that this could have happen at any given time and at almost anywhere.<br />This book is not just another one of them feel good story it's a whole lot more. This is something that can not be expressed in words.<br />This is a very powerful reminder that we really have to pay attention to everything that's going on around us and to make sure that we know what it is that we are doing,
B0098460O4|4.0|I saw these two on YouTube at their debut in Brirain's Got Talent and was astonished at the vocal powerhouse these two exhibited. I got the album. The album is good but lacks to a fair extent the dynamism of their BGT performance.<br />Paul Potts first two albums are better, but this one is satisfactory. I hope they broaden their repertoire and Jonathan unleashes that Pavarotti-like voice of his. Compare his rendition of The Prayer on the album to the BGT version and you'll hear what I mean. With some more gusto, more fire, they can rule the world or go down the weed-choked path of missed greatness. I anticipate their next release.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this is an important tool to take my knife edge, is easy to carry in the field because take less weight
B009G7ZYPY|1.0|First of all, there is no question this woman is gifted with a fabulous vocal talent. Sadly, ALL of her albums are a feeble collection of half-hearted, lame, half-sung, mostly spoken vocal noise. If you saw the clips of her from Britain's Got Talent, she is absolutely electrifying. Her albums are completely opposite. Lethargic, wimpy, and unremittingly irritating. Where is the range, the expression, the depth, the power? Looks like she left it at home. Listening to her gives me an earache.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|First of all, it arrived very fast, delivered on the 18 and came on the 19. Second of all, item looks exactly as the product picture. Third of, supposedly there's a special preview of the next movie in the trilogy this month, details inside :)

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It opens .pdf documents on my android and does what it's supposed to, what more can you say about Adobe?
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|It's very nice to look at, but the difficulty level suddenly leaps from mildly challenging to physically impossible. I have to give it a general thumbs down on that basis, but it's pretty fun up to that point.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Works like a champ on my kindle, I use it for my secondary e-mail account, so's I don't get all that facebook garbage on my android.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The Denzel Washington character had me completely fooled.  I thought his character was about a jock saving an aircraft--it was about saving himself from himself while on the ground!  His character blew me away!  Very provoking!
B002ZG9800|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Different from any other movie I've seen and with a smattering of funny bits thrown in.  Carrey and MacGregor were good.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck is both director and main actor in an Iranian hostage crisis during which six of 150 Americans, holed up in the Canadian embassy, during the Carter administration, will try to make it out of Tehran alive.  The Affleck character takes this task upon himself, not knowing whether or not he can pull it off; and the six Americans not knowing if the Affleck character can really get them out.  This film cuts to our own emotions of whether to trust ourselves and someone else with our lives--whether we should follow someone else's directives during a crisis or not.  Gut-wrenching material to the very end!
B0058VW36U|4.0|Whether a child or an adult, this is one of those games that can get one &#34;hooked&#34;.  That's not a criticism, it a fun game to play and also develops one's thinking ability.  No one is too old the learn, right?
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|With a little work in the beginning, this game quickly becomes a lot of fun. Runs smooth on my RAZR.
0802473156|5.0|This book is something eveyrbody should have  by the time they reach the age of understanding.  My Granddaughters, 13,12 &10.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I loved the game so much. The only con was that a lot of the ponies were wayyyyy expensive. I'm sad because my game won't work now... it acts like it's going to work but cuts back to the home screen / carousel screen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book and the story line just gets better! I couldn't put it down!  The Capitol is so messed up.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love the way Mr. Follett has woven the families together as they fight the Great War.  It was an insight into war that I had never seen before.  So much killing, and those that were fighting didn't know what they were fighting for.  I wonder if all wars are that way?<br />I am already on the second novel of the Trilogy and am enjoying this book as well
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie was full of action, violence, and intense emotional ups and downs. I can really understand why the people who watched it felt let down by the end too. It was hard for me to put into words but...<br /><br />***Spoiler alert***<br /><br />For the ones who want to know why, it's simple. If you follow a character through the entire story, you want to see them get their happily ever after ending. You want to see them win. You are financially vested with the character you watched on their journey. If they suddenly die and cease to exist, it's over. Pointless, but still interesting.<br /><br />To me this story was about the guy who was a looper and an assassin. When he dies, it was like what was the point of watching this movie?? The movie changed it so midway it became about the kid with the superpowers who becomes head of the mafia organization in the future. We should have been following his story, not the looper.<br /><br />Still this was one of those movies that you can't stop thinking about once you watch it. I enjoyed it and thought it was well written and good, if not slightly violent.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game I am so addicted!!!!!!<br />There should be others just like it.....can't stop playing from the start of the game
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing, definitely not for younger age, but its great. Can't wait to read the second one! I would recommend this book in a heartbeat to those who like an extra spice in their lives
B003VIW8DK|2.0|Bryan Ferry is my favorite all time musician. Having said that, this album was uneven for me. A couple good tracks but outnumbered by ones I didn't care for.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read the first book, and I was hooked. I'm now halfway through the second book, and it's so addicting. So many twists and dramatic things going on. Can't wait to read the third book.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|A thrilling movie that caught me off guard more than once. It keeps you on your toes wanting more. You dont know who to believe and which character you want to win. Well written and one of Mathews better films.
B00631VJIC|5.0|I am an avid fan of sons, I've been watching them from the start and I've always loved the music. About a month ago it dawned on me &#34; hey, get the soundtrack for my car&#34;. Great decision! It's been in my cd player in the car the whole time with the exception of the other sons soundtrack (I alternate) but it never gets old. Love it!
0762445262|4.0|I know from description product was not going to be very big but oh my when I opened the box I was a little stunned it was so tiny.  Cute as could be though and works well when lights are all off...just could be a little bigger for the price.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this app is sooooo cool it is truly like having a real horse I suggest this app for people who really want a horse
0545128285|2.0|was disappointed that the book had little to do with the movies and the books - it was discussed in the books as the folk tales told by wizards. Still, it was hard to get interested in it.
B00913DPW2|5.0|There are hours of fun to be had in this game.  The graphics are wonderful and the puzzles are challenging but not impossible.  The clues available to help you throughout the game make it much easier if you get stuck.  I play these games every time a well made new one comes out and this is by far one of the best.  It worked perfectly with my Kindle Fire second edition. Now I am going to play number two, cannot wait!! This app is worth the money, and actually, I would have paid much more for it. Keep them coming...
0395925037|5.0|Fuherer Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) was one of the worst tyrants who ever lived. His name and despicable Nazi movement will forever live in infamy in the hall of shame and terror. Nevertheless, reading Mein Kampf (My Struggle) his political testament is a valuable resource in the study of the Nazi movement as Hitler led Germany into hell. His anti-semitic screed accuses Germany Jewry ( a tiny portion of the German people) for the defeat of the Reich in World War I. Hitler hated the parliamentary democracy of the Weimar Republic; distrusted France and was in favor of the odious philosophy of eugenics. The young Hitler believed in social Darwinism in which the supposed Aryan superior race would rule the world. Hitler produced Mein Kampf while in Landsberg Prison in 1924-26. Hitler had been sentenced to prison for his involvement in the Munich putsch of 1924 which sought to overthrow the Bavarian government in Munich. The infamous book later became required reading in Nazi Germany; all couples who married in the Third Reich were given a copy! The book is tedious reading. Hitler's style is atrocious and his half-baked racial theories make the reader wretch in disgust! A few quotes from the long book will give you a flavor for the contents:<br />\\"To learn history means to seek and find the forces which are the causes leading to those effects wich we subsequently perceiv e  as historical events. The art of reading as of learning is this: to retain the essential, to forget the non-essential.\\"-p. 14<br />\\"I had honored my father, but my mother I loved.\\"-p. 18<br />\\"I painted to make a living and studied for pleasure...I believe that those who knew me in those days took me for an eccentric.\\"<br />-p. 34<br />\\"I had at last come to the conclusion that the Jew was no German.\\"-p. 61<br />\\"In general the art of all truly great national leaders at all times consists among other things primarily in not dividing the attention of a people, but in concentrating upon a single foe.\\"-p. 118<br />\\"Thus we see that propaganda must follow a simple line and correspondingly the basic tactics must be ...sound.\\"-p. 181<br />\\"Those who want to live, let them fight and those who do not want to fight in this world of eternal struggled do not deserve to live.\\"p. 289<br />\\"Leadership itself requires not only will but also ability, and a greater importance must be attached to will and energy than to intelligence as such, and most valuable of all is a combination of ability, determination and perseverance.\\"-p. 349.<br />\\"For this only beings were fitted in whom spirit and body had acquired those military virtues which can perhaps best be described as follows: swift as greyhounds, tough as leather and hard as Krupp steel.:-p. 356<br />\\"Human culture and civilization on this continent are inseparably bound up with the presence of the Aryan. If he dies out or declines the dark veils of an age without culture will again descend on this globe.\\"-p. 382<br /> Hitler was a failed artist who lived a shabby life in Viennna. He moved to Munich and won distinction in World War I. He developed his movement in Munich and rose to power in 1933.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Enjoyed this book because it is well written, humorous and the main character is an engineer. The story is really about solving problems and Watney is adept at this. Watney's greatest asset is his attitude and how he deals with the situation he finds himself in.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|See the headline says it all! Cast and sets are spot on perfect for the time a place. Well done all
B0086213XW|5.0|The acting by Seth Rogen was a complete surprise!  Instead of playing the idiot child/man...he actually played a thoughtful, and provoking role.  Michelle was wonderful....so many faucets to her personality.<br />If you ever have been in a \\"dead-end\\" relationship or marriage, you can understand the pull of leaving security for an unknown relationship.  The movie explores the theme of sexual desperation to be loved and the sorrow of leaving behind a history with someone, to hopefully, find the total package.<br />It was masterfully played out and yes, it's slow, for a reason.  It's a cerebral movie, not an Action \\"shooting and car chases\\" movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The book is a very good and something you might want to read the books all together. You should read it your self.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|It's been 7 years since Justin Timberlake's last album and in that time, he's become a movie star and also gotten married. He appears to have taken some of the atmosphere and drama of movies and applied it to his music, with most songs clocking past 7 minutes and taking unexpected turns; epic and cinematic. Produced by Timbaland, the sound is futuristic and retro, lavish or spare at the drop of a hat.<br /><br />Opening the album is \\"Pusha Love Girl\\" with a string-swathed overture leading to a falsetto-sung mid tempo strut and an electro hip hop coda. \\"I'm just a j-junkie for your love\\" he sings. Still mid tempo is lead single \\"Suit & Tie\\" with an eighties Soul groove and a rap by Jay-Z.<br /><br />\\"Don't Hold The Wall\\" is a meandering tune with Mid Eastern flourishes, rattling percussion, and an obtuse tempo change at the 4:20 mark. \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" is a trippy experimental piece that wouldn't sound out of place on a Frank Ocean or Miguel album.<br /><br />Other standouts are the skeletal horn-peppered retro Soul \\"That Girl\\", the funky riotous percussion-driven MJ-channelling \\"Let The Groove In\\" (with horns darting all over the place and is like \\"Off The wall\\" meets \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\"), the lovely \\"Mirrors\\" (which reminds one of his hit \\"Cry Me A River\\"), and the closing spare woozy \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" which allows him to shine vocally.<br /><br />Those seeking dance floor bangers like \\"Rock Your Body\\" or \\"Sexy Back\\" will be disappointed. Those willing to grow along with him will be taken on an interesting ride. Sexy is back though all mature, slower and sensual.
1609611543|5.0|I saw this book in Costco and wanted to pick it up, but I was a bit skeptical. I've been on many, many diets previously, and was wary of yet another one. I was flirting with the idea of going paleo, and had read that book, but I just couldn't fathom giving up my favourite thing: wheat.<br /><br />I saw Dr. Davis on Dr. Oz, and all of the stuff he was saying made sense. It just seemed to click with me. I then went online looking for testimonials. I was convinced this was something I had to try. So on Saturday, I started. Even made it through Costco on \\"Sample Day\\" and avoided the temptations.<br /><br />I'm on day 4 of no wheat, and down 9 pounds. I started at 289lbs. The first day was horrible in terms of the wheat/sugar withdrawal headache, but day 2 was easier. Yesterday was just fine, and today is going well, too. I even made yesterday's supper meatless! Tonight I am looking forward to seared pork chops with mushrooms, mixed greens salad and steamed asparagus. No real deprivation, just a true desire to become my healthiest self. That is worth WAY more than baked goods, or deep-fried batter.
B005LAIGWS|3.0|not as good as the origional movie. abit of an disapointment. I don,t know if I would watch it again.
B00632HWOG|1.0|not able to get it on the kindle, the first time I try to use it, I was hacked, try several times with new pass, and it does not work.
B008D36INE|1.0|I waste my time watching this joke.<br />Nothing interesting. Sound, argument and Photography are poor.<br />Rachel Weisz should not accept that role. Her performance was not bad but the story did not help.<br /><br />A deep blue deception!
B004A903AE|4.0|For Those , like myself , who have long forgotten about Biafra this is a touching reminder. Shattering to realize that side by side lived the starving, diseased population with those seemingly untouched and continuing as usual.  i am left pondering how far academia, intellectualism, and idealism serve a nation that is basically tribal; one that remains divided upon familial heritage, in nature.  I am left ,sadly , with the feeling there are no answers.<br /><br />Read it. Remember. Apply the experience to what one reads about Sunni/ shite; Hindu/ Moslem; Arab/Jew conflicts.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|This is must-have music.  Haley Williams is an excellent singer, songwriter, and lyricist.  Unfortunately,  there have been many band changes since then.
B0048WQDIE|4.0|As the book began I was thinking wow this is slow and boring, but shortly it changed,and I was immersed in the characters and all their quirks and strange interesting personalities.
B0002BO05S|4.0|I am well pleased with this product.  I wanted to watch 'religious' movies during lent and this met my expectations.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|What a team they make as &#34;mates.&#34; This is worth the watching just to see how he and Donna mesh. Well, for a bride that couldn't get rid of him fast enough that is.
B00005JMCN|4.0|I like this movie because the characters are all good people and not trying to 'outdo' each other.  Will watch the movie again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun and addictive gems need to be easier to get tho then game would be perfect and more fun!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is so fun you guys have to get it! The only thing i dont like about it is that whenever you decide not to play it for a while it erases your coins and characters ablnd score and starts you completley over! other than that its a great game!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are full of sadness and surprises that will make you never want to put it down.It tells a story of a amazing Katniss and life. I think you should read the book.
B004O86JZ4|4.0|Another great Foo Fighters album, albeit not my favorite, but still great.<br /><br />My only concern was why it sounded terrible on my turntable. The audio was all messed up so I thought maybe I needed to adjust my platter speed. Come to find out I needed to treat it like a 45 RPM record instead of a 33, which you would think it is based off of appearance.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is the best solitaire game I've ever found on a mobile platform.  It's great on all sizes of screen and with all orientations.  The only gripe is that the ads are anyoying.  I get ads for the same company's games that I already have installed, or I get full screen, hard to skip ads.  Either way, better than average experience.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Good so far works well with kindle fire hd.  Suggest others decide to get it! Played five levels so far
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I wish she would continue this series! It was my favorite book in the series! But it leaves things unanswered :(

B008MEM24S|5.0|I initially got this for my son but I play it myself so much that my husband teases me about it.  Great fun for everyone and challenging enough to give your brain a good work-out!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs a master, genius, designer and inventor all rolled into one person. Modern day Franklin or Ford, what a legacy this one man created. A must read if you want to see what one person Can Accomplish. Awesome
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Red is my favorite T.Swift album since Fearless was released. The album starts strong with State of Grace, an upbeat song and one of my top favs off this album, and just goes up from there. All Too Well has to be my top favorite song. This album is a great travel album and makes the time fly by with many upbeat songs mixed with some nice ballads. I would highly recommend this album.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Huge fan of the show and the books.  Done really well, and of course in HBO fashion it comes with a ridiculous amount of sex.  Most of it happens in the books anyway, just maybe with less detail.  Heh.<br /><br />Did I mention that I love that this comes with all the formats I could need?  Digital copies need to be included with everything.
0316056871|5.0|I will admit...I almost didn't buy this book because of it's cover! I love Tina Fey but found the cover disturbing, so I never picked it up at the bookstore. But after hearing good reviews, I finally bought it and I'm happy I did. The parts I found the most interesting were her stories about her life before SNL, and the backstories about her various shows.<br />Oh, and Tina Fey, if you ever read this - I never noticed your scar until you pointed it out in your book!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was surprised when this book actually evoked an emotional response from me towards the end.  I feel like this is an excellently-crafted story.  It had everything I could want and left me satisfied - but in case I'm tricking myself, there are... 4 more books.  Haha!  Hooray.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|It's okay, it's a convienent..Better in a case, then without one...I also see them in the store, didn't know I could of buy them.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|It's HBO so they do go a bit overboard with any sexual themes that were even hinted at in the books, but hey, I'm not complaining.  Pretty true to the source material and well-adapted to the screen.  Thankful for multiple formats in one package.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|Blame \\"Master of The House\\" for lack of 5 star rating...can't stand that song.<br /><br />1. Look Down-Better....maintained than the version on the regular soundtrack. People need to give Russell Crowe a break.At least he can sing better than Pierce Brosnan(Mamma Mia).Still seems to cut off too soon.<br />2.The Bishop-No change from original abridged soundtrack.<br />3.Valjean's Sololiquoy-As far as I can tell...same as original unabridged soundtrack version,<br />4.At The End of The Day-How I wish I had my soundtrack in front of me..I can't remember this being on it.Like how its got the broadway-esque sound to it. I'm seeing the stage version this year and feel as if this is akin to what I'll be hearing. Poor Fantine always being picked on.Once again seems to end far too abruptly.<br />5.The Docks(Lovely Ladies)-Now this I KNOW wasn't on the soundtrack I bought in December.Audio could use some work I have to turn up my volume just to hear what they're saying.<br />6.I Dreamed a Dream-I love this song. When I saw this in theaters...I went on opening day...I bawled my eyes out watching this scene.and when I thought I was finished she sang the \\"shame\\" part...well I started up again.I am now forever biased towards Anne's version of this song. She DESERVED that Oscar.<br />7.Fantine's Arrest-Poor Fatine she was raped and the man gets his version of justice. Javert...what about her side of the story,huh? Once again...She deserved the Ocar for this performance. And Jackman was robbed...once again referring to the Oscars.<br />8.Who am I?-FINALLY!!! We have been waiting for forever.This was in the promo clips for the film.So why did we have to wait for it until nearly the DVD release date? Its such a good song.So full of emotion...Valjean's inner conflict.Once again not loud enough to hear.and this is all I'm listening to.No animals,No TV,etc.But the \\"24601\\" part. Better and more defined in the film itself.Too soft here.<br />9.Fantine's Death-So beautiful. And OMG I can actually hear this one.Hathaway sounds darn near flawless. She sounds beautiful even in her weak state(meaning Fantine's of course).Trying not to cry..\\"Be at peace\\". Did I mention Jackman was robbed of that Oscar? Good song. AND unlike others it doesn't seem to end to soon.<br />10.The Confrontation-No different than the version on the CD I bought in December.<br />11.Castle on a Cloud-No different than the version on the CD I bought in December<br />12.Master of The House-Yeah,not gonna listen to this again if I don't have to. I have a review of the abridged version(of the CD)...just click on my username. Should still be on the first page.If you wanna know my thoughts on this and various other songs here.<br />13.The Bargain-Longer than I remember.My poor poor Eponine. This is when her life goes to hell(figuratively speaking).Once Again too quiet to hear.He's bargaining with them and they're A) not listening and B)trying to rob him blind. LOL on Sascha's accent and mispronunciation of her name. At least one of the Thernadier's knows her name. They're so annoying. I think I'll pass on this one from now on too.<br />14.Suddenly-Its such a beautiful song. And it really annoys mean when people bash it.It shows Valjean's new found love for Cosette perfectly.So, its not in the musical.Its not going to be exactly the same...considering I don't know-ITS A MOVIE.<br />15.The Convent-Can't hear it!!! Can't find a full version to listen to at this time. Can't remember it from the film.Sorry.<br />16.Stars-Once again people need to stop hating on Russell Crowe.Maybe if they stop whining long enough.They'll hear the beautiful message of the song. And personally, I think he's good in this.<br />17.Paris/Look Down-I remember this one.How do you do me name is Gavroche.Its when the people are revolting Because their leader is dying.Sadly, can't find a full version of this one to listen to either.<br />18.The Robbery-Took me a sec to realize...that's Eponine singing.Another Thernadier song...I'm out.<br />19.ABC Cafe/Red and Black-Enjolras is rallying the revolution and Marius is distracted by thoughts of Cosette.Best I can do atm. Probably a more in depth review of the song on the other review I did.<br />20.In My Life-Sadly all I can find is the version mashed up with \\"A Heart full of Love\\".<br />21.A Heart full of love-Not my favorite.Probably a more in depth look in my other review.<br />22.On My Own-One of my favorites. You really feel for Eponine.And Sam of course nails it.She would considering she's been Eponine on broadway.<br />23.One Day More-A really good song.Just wow. Look I'm not up for doing another full on review of it right now. Check out my other review.And if you're feeling really gutsy. Look up the Les Miserables Oscar performance on Youtube.<br /><br />~Disc 2~<br />24. Do you hear the people sing?- So empowering. Once again too quiet. I love hearing this on the TV spots.But the quality of this-bleck.<br />25.Building the Barricade-Shots.Commotion.Talking.Over an orchestra playing.Bored.Outta listening to it.<br />26.Javert at the barricade-Javert,who exactly are you trying to double cross?Gavroche can call your bluff...so I'm wondering just how smart you think you are. Ends too soon.<br />27.The First Attack-Talking.Shots. Commotion.again.<br />28.A Little Fall of Rain-FINALLY!!! I got stuck with having to hear stupid Nick Jonas just so I could hear Sam sing this.Now I can delete it and have the version I wanted on my ipod in the first place.I will seriously pay just about any sum of money(within reason) to have this version.<br />29.Drink with me-So sad. They know they're going to die.And this is the last hurrah.Short..If they really wanted to make me cry they'd make it longer.<br />30.Bring Him Home-Another really good song. Valjean sees how much Marius loves Cosette and begs god to take him instead.<br />31.The Death of Gavroche-Love how they start with \\"Do you hear the people sing?\\".So sad. I mean the soldier(s) killeda little kid.How can they not feel guilt over this?Too short/ends too soon.<br />32.The Final Battle-Pretty self explanatory.<br />33.The Sewers-Talking again.<br />34.Javert's suicide-A fave. Javert is conflicted because Valjean has just spared his life.<br />35.Turning-Sad. But 0:38...yeah,short.really short.<br />36.Empty Chairs at Empty Tables-Marius mourns for his friends.<br />37.A heart full of love(reprise)-Cosette comforts Marius. She's not going anywhere. Valjean realizes he can't keep her with him forever.<br />38. Valjean's Confession-Valjean tells Marius of his past.<br />39. Suddenly (Reprise)-Cosette learns of Valjean's departure from Marius.0:54 another really short one.<br />40.The Wedding-Can only find it mashed up with \\"Beggars at the feast\\".<br />41. Beggars At The Feast-Thernadiers again.<br />42.Epilogue-A fave. Pretty self explanatory.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The discussion of assisted suicide is fascinating and handled in a beautiful and thought provoking way. A great read. I never put it down.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I was a little worried because I was sure she thought this was Jake and the Never land pirates. However, she likes this just the same. :)
B00BSBY38A|3.0|An interesting story but a little slow at the beginning. This has agood story line and was of good quality in HD.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|My whole family and especially my 4 year old daughter love it! The only way it could be better, is if they released it on blu-ray.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|This movie was not worth watching for the price of rental. A very slow and boreing film that makes it difficult to even watch.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Nice look. Perfect time. no battery. The box presentation is awesome, shuold get one to give to you or someone else
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Acting was excellent and the plot keep you watching even though you knew how it turned out.  No wonder it won Best Pix
B0013D8G7C|5.0|I'm a huge Alicia Keys fan and this album does not disappoint. You get to hear more piano and her voice is incredible as always.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|Vendor did very well shipping was fast product was not damaged in anywa movie played will on my da Blu ray movie played will on my Blu ray DVD exceptional movie
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Very good read, action packed, never a dull moment. I will read more of his works. Reminds me of the tv show 24!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved it easy to follow and characters are great. A great wired twisted love story. I can't wait to see movie
B009JBWOU0|4.0|We enjoyed the first film and  are looking forward to watching the next two soon.  I would recommend the trilogy.
B00846WWVM|3.0|Enjoyed the first few levels as something mindless to pass the time. I don't like spending a lot of time wrapped up in my phone apps, so i don't play much. Got almost impossible within the first level pack...  was fun until that.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Great book! Gave good background of each girl! I watch the series on ABC and love it and now I am obsessed with the books!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Justin is telling a different love story on this album. He ain't chasing love no more, that's for sure. When I heard it, I felt like it was a mature extension of both the tones set on Justified and Future/Sex LoveSounds. The production on the album is strong / different and Justin is a bit more experimental vocally (but not necessarily daring.) I like the overall journey of the album, every song isn't a WOW but each song flows and has its moments of pure JT ecstasy and makes you keep wanna listening. It's certainly not for those who can't appreciate the calmer progression of an album with continuous flowing melody and a smooth jazzy, lovey dove feeling.<br /><br />And if you don't like JT's swag in general, then you won't like this album as a whole. That's really the dealbreaker of what it comes down to. I'm happy with this work, it's fed my appetitite for the time being.<br /><br />Fav songs: Pusher Girl, Strawberry Bubblegum, Space Coup, That Girl
B008220C38|4.0|I felt that the story line was able to follow the original book very well.  As the story developed I was pleased with the way the actors handled their roles;
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I downloaded this app, not even knowing what it was.  It's a surprisingly scary game.  So simple but it freaks me out.
B003O86FMW|5.0|BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!<br /><br />I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERY ONE.<br />I FEAL BAD FOR LINCOLN AND WASHINGTON THAT THEY DIDN'T READ THIS BOOK.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|The 20/20 Experience is just that-An Experience, and what a mind blowing experience!....True musical art at it's best. What Justin and Timbaland did with this album is so inspiring. When I first put my Beats by Dre headphones on and listened to it, I was amazed! The love, passion, conviction, and care that Justin puts into his music is undeniable. You can feel his soul coming through and it's very touching. Even the faster more uptempo songs had me crying because I couldn't believe my ears! There's no way to describe it you just have to listen to it. Music like this does not come around very often these days and Justin Timberlake has just gotten better with time. This is his best album to date and I will also say that this is the best album of the year..yeh I know the year's not over with yet...I don't care. No doubt that he will win more Grammy's for this album I know it! Amazing and I am not exaggerating when I call it a masterpiece. Usually off any album you can pick 2 or 3 or even 1 song that is your favorite. Justin Timberlake won't go for that, not this time. I cannot pick a favorite song! You will not skip a track, each song is so unique and so special. That is just how wonderful The 20/20 Experience is.....I cannot say enough good things about it. I love Justin Timberlake!!!! Lol.
1451648537|3.0|I appreciated the authors attempt to be objective about Jobs' methods and style as well as his corporate accomplishments. I have to conclude that his reputation is not coincidently exactly the same size as his ego, and I had a little trouble finishing the book. I was especially disraught to hear him dis The Stones (\\"someone else could have done that\\") when his ipod did not even include Let it Bleed, Beggars Banquet, or Exile (mostly 80's seconds). A perfect example of his warped reality! I'll bet Bill Gates has Exile on his iPod.
0679805273|5.0|You can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss books. This is an all ages book that can be kept child after child. I find it inspirational myself and my 6 year old understands the concept for the most part. Definitely will be keeping this in our personal library.
B007REV4T8|5.0|It arrived fast and I know it is good because I saw it in te theatre.  I have Daniel Craig's other Bond movies and I really like him as an actor.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|After I got to the half way point in reading this book, I couldn't put my kindle down. Can't wait to read the next book.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Not the best of the &#34;new&#34; batman movies but still bretty darn good.  I am glad to have it in my collection.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This movie is fantastic. I was bored during the beginning, because I do not like fantasy.  However, as the story progressed, I was laughing a lot. The scenes when Thor had to adjust to life on earth were very funny.
0439882826|5.0|I bought one of these for the son of a friend of mine a few years ago and he loves it.  I got this one for my grandson.  He is only 2 1/2 years old but I will give it to him when I think he is ready for it.  he loves star wars already so he will go nuts when I give it to him.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Pretty usful. I used it for my profile pics :) it works well and no lagging! Really good for photographers!
B00BG08FKK|4.0|I love Les Mis, loved the movie, own many versions of soundtrack. I love with this version that they sang live and I think they all did a good job. Gave this four not five stars because the songs run into each other, so if I want to listen to just \\"Stars\\" it gets cut off at the end, same with \\"On My Own\\"
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this book, so much that I'm not sure if I want to see the movie. Very good, extremely glad I read it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Some interesting twists in this one. Good read with current relevance. Got to love Rapp and Hurley. Looking forward to the next installment.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This movie is true based. I needed to see it three times before the whole setting of the movie brought out the total picture of the movie's telling. It was action packed and it kept one guessing at what just happened. That is why I purchased the movie so as I could put it all together and understand better of how the 6 U.S. men and woman wormed their way through the area and how they narrowly got out of Iran. It was probably fictional in the response of the ending by flying out, but I do not really remember how they got out. The movie seem to of kept my mind wanting to understand the events unfolding. So much happened so fast in this true life event and then the rest of the other people spent their remaining 444 days in captivity in Iran before being released. It gives the feeling that this can happen anytime and anywhere in the world without warning. It shows you what happens to a people emotionally stable, as to what terror can do to you as time moves on with uncertainty. it shows that idle threats can be devastating to ones well being. It shows how someone, anyone with confidence can do what seems impossible. That is the American way
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Para ser el menor de la gama es superior a cualquier 1155 y 1366. Resistente y confiable. No me ha dejado mal con ninguna de mis exigencias.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I needed to see this powerful movie. I saw this movie when it come out to the theaters immediately. Afterwords I bought the movie before, but it was lost. So I have repurchased the movie again because I remember how the movie captivated me so and I wanted to be able to go back and watch it time and again so as to not loose the feeling of what GOD did or for us. As he gave his life on the cross for our SINS. To me being a convert, I have read most of the BIBLE, but to watch a movie and to sit down with the BIBLE to follow it in front of me and be able to actually follow the movie and the BIBLE was astounding. Areas of the BIBLE and the movie have never left my memory. The movie is extremely well made. Yes, there are areas that enhanced the movie's path, but over-all the movie is dear to my heart. If you have any emotions, this movie will bring them out. It to can also allow you to feel pain if you have any feelings of others. If you have not seen this movie, change your life and watch it. It shows you what HUMILITY really is, just case you do not understand humility. You shall not be disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What more is there to say that hasn't been said.  WD is an awesome series, and so far, getting better every year.  I hope it continues for years to come.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|The entire album is unlke anything that I have ever heared. I can't put it down. this is a masterpiece.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|This movie really should get better reviews, I don't know why it doesn't. I'm recommending this movie, it was fantastic!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Bought this movie on a whim because my 9 year old nephew was going to be staying with us.  We watched it as a family along with our nephew and 16 month old son and we were all highly entertained.  Cute and witty and some inside jokes for the adults that kept us laughing.  My husband walked around saying, &#34;I do not say blah, blah, blah&#34; for days.<br /><br />Love that this particular version came with a digital copy.  Can't beat the dvd/digital combo for $9.00
B0088ZSKOC|5.0|My insomnia has been a life long companion. I have been this way since childhood and have never understood how people go to bed and just fall asleep. It seems amazing to me. I've tried absolutely everything and now at 54 I'm finally, peacefully sleeping. Bliss! I cannot say how this wonderful guided meditation may work for others but it has been perfect for me. It is a combination of several things I believe...first and foremost, Andrew Johnson's comforting words and beautiful Scottish accent. I've used at least 10 other apps for this problem and none of them provided me with that sense of well-being and contentment Mr. Johnson does. And the quality of the recording is flawless with lovely background music. There is something so comforting about it and apparently, that is exactly what I needed. Insomnia has been such an overwhelming problem for me for so long that negatively affected so many aspects of my life that I feel very blessed to have found this and that it works so well.
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|the moon told me to write this review.<br />The real star of the movie was the yeti. I think the yeti should have it's own movie.<br />The movie was kind of sappy, but in general it was okay.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game need to get it it is very goodfor something that is free that is what my review is about
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Yet another Disney Classic finally available on Blu-ray. There is little to be said about Peter Pan that has not already been said dozens of times. Despite the age of the movie, it still looks clean and crisp in this Blu-ray offering.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|I just downloaded this app and so far, it's been amazing. I really like to use it to save pictures and statuses on Facebook that I want to be easily accessible, and to create pins on Pinterest (which this app makes very easy). My only complaint is that when snapping online pictures, after you've edited the picture and saved it, you can't just go back to the webpage you left off on. If you want to snap more pictures from a particular webpage you have to access that webpage all over again through the app. If that were to be fixed and made easier, I would give this app 5 stars. :)
B004SDEP38|1.0|I downloaded and install this &quot;FREE&quot; application when I went to use it I had to (1)Register the program and (2) PAY FOR THE APPLICATION IF YOU WANT TO USE IT.<br />9<br /><br />THIS IS  a HIGHWAY ROBBERY do not be fooled it will cost you $14.95

B00BRUYQFC|3.0|Timbaland needs to shut up. The decision to use him, and co-producer J-Roc, was a wise one; their grooves are sleek and often superb; but he rarely, if ever, has anything poignant to add vocally. His signature ad-libs serve as not much more than a minor distraction made major because it happens too often. This is a Justin Timberlake album, after all. And though Timberlake is no master poet himself, he does have a pleasant singing voice and a knack for vocal melody. For comparison's sake, since it would take an artist at-least near Michael Jackson's level to take the King Of Pop crown, you can call Justin Timberlake a modern-day Andy Gibb. Like Gibb, as creatively limited as it is, most of his songs have to do with girls and romance. In the case of this album, they all do.<br /><br />Beside stealing Barry White's music and emulating Prince's falsetto, the set begins, and ends, with a random metaphor. The Love he has for his \\"baby\\" is a drug addiction. Their romantic getaway is a Blue Ocean Floor. Even Let The Groove Get In, a party anthem that simply encourages people to dance, is focused on \\"little mama\\". It's also built around an annoying party chant that is abandoned for a much better 1970s-style floater about three-fourths in. For better or worse, most of these songs make grand transformations at some point. That Girl, the skit-like introduction of which throws things off a bit, isn't much to look at and I don't see anything special in Mirrors, but much of this 20-20 Experience, the title of which allows for such corny visual puns, is dazzling enough.<br /><br />marcellee.com

B00B99KJR0|4.0|Won't download on Fire HD, gets to what looks like end of download, then message that it failed, I have tried MULTIPLE times and same result each time. Looks like many have the same problem, would like to play it, but I have to give 1 STAR since I can't give any lower star, don't offer the game if you have a HUGE bug like this.  Will update if I can EVER download the game.<br /><br />UPDATE: contacted Amazon, they were aware of the problem and withing 24 hours it downloaded fine, I do like the game! Great graphics, match 3 game. revised stars to 4 instead of 1... thanks for the fix!!!!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Good story, willkeep your interest if you like to unravel mysteries.  Not hard to located items and the mini game are doable.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is awesome I play it every day<br />The first time I played this game I was amazed.you should try it
B0086700CM|5.0|Great, fast, need good coordination which I dont' have so I don't get far.  I would highly recommend to try
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I luv this game!! it is so addictive. my 9yr old twins like to help over my shoulder. I luv that it challenging. awesome!!! Lots of levels too.
030746363X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have seen. It is very informative and is great to continously reference. It isn't one of those books you will read and forget!
B007REV4T8|4.0|read that it was the best one ever; set my expectations high and it did not deliver; it is good but not the greatest.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|so this review isn't about the movie, cuz it was awesome, but just solely about the this bluray set.<br />there are 4 discs, 3d bluray, bluray, dvd and digital copy. but there are only two holders, so each holder holds two discs. so basically its one disc on top of another on one side and another disc on top of another disc on the other side of the bluray case.<br />so if i were you guys, i'd put the dvd discs in first, than the blurays on top of them so they aren't damaged. blurays are harder to scratch so they can be placed on top.<br />the special features are pretty neat. you get all 4 video game commercials featuring wreck it ralph as it would of looked like if it really was a game back in the early 80's, sugar rush commercial, hero's duty commercial, and a commercial featuring felix juniors hammer which is pretty funny.<br />theres a 16min featurette that talks about the film and how they came to make it. i would of hoped this featurette which was really fun to watch would of been longer and i'm sure it could of been longer. oh well.<br />the deleted scenes/alternate scenes are really alternate scenes. if you see them, which they aren't even completed, they are a mix of pencil drawings with overlays and some very minor special affects to help tell the story that would of been. basically just simple storyboards that really had nothing to do with the final product. so that tells you how different the movie would of been or was in the beginning stages of making this film. they are pretty interesting to look at the route they thought of taking.<br />obviously paperman short is here. a must see!<br />and audio commentaries on the deleted/alternate scenes.<br /><br />so there you have it. i think i covered it all. enjoy!
1439152802|4.0|Can't say it's the best book I've ever read, but it's good enough to keep me going back to finish it.
B00BN2CY7G|5.0|Some reviews on here say Bon Jovi has strayed from their roots, I can hear them clearly in ever song. I am enjoying this CD just as much as all of their other releases. Classic sounds. I love it!
0143120530|3.0|Haven't read much of the copy yet; it may get better. Need to read more before I say I don't like it; but so far it hasn't been a &#34;real page turner.&#34;
B0063M22QO|5.0|I downloaded it 2 nights ago and cannot stop! really comparable to the computer version but much better as the challenge is addictively fun.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|its as great as season 1,2,&3. we can sit and watch it over and over and never get tired of it. my better half could watch it all the time if i let him ,exspecially when theres nothing easle good on tv
B004J64QSI|5.0|I've always loved the music from Les Miserables. This video that they recorded for the 25th anniversary is fantastic!! Everyone has such amazing voices.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I chose this rating because i really do like this bible, what i thought could be improved, is having audio in other versions.<br />I would recommend this You Version Bible to everyone who may be interested in it.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This movie is fantastic!! Most holiday movies always depict the characters the same way. A fat jolly Santa, a small white easter bunny, a frilly pink tooth fairy. So this version is amazing. It's so different. Also the graphics in this movie are incredible.<br /><br />It's super fun to watch for both kids and adults. Hilarious movie but also touching. Highly recommend this movie!!
0439813786|4.0|We have twin grandsons who like to read alot.To encourage them,we will purchase books from the school order forms that they bring over.However;we have found that buying online is much cheaper for the same item.
0694013013|5.0|My grandson (18 months), LOVES this book. His two favorites are the gorilla and elephant. There is nothing better than thumping your chest or stomping your feet.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Found this book to have a gentle flow, like a great movie. I recommend this book to anyone who has experienced depression.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it. I will enjoy reading the bible in more places now. Has it in different languages and versions . Easy to get around
B004FQX5CK|5.0|One of the greatest sci-fi ever.  The blu-ray makes the colors shine.  The rain feels as if in your living room.
B008I34YYY|2.0|This independent European production has been in the works for several years. It starts out seeming like one kind of movie, right turns to look like some thing else entirely and then does a quick reverse ending up where it started. At the end it just comes apart at the seams. Technically it looks great, the CGI is top notch and you can see where the big money went. I felt for the actors, they really did try hard to make it work but poor writing, choppy editing and uneven pacing doesn't work to make this comedy, sci-fi, sex farce interesting or amusing. It's too long and it's not especially funny or entertaining.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Little bit of a mix of R&B and Pop. Basically what you'd expect from Timberlake and also guaranteed to get the ladies going. Guy just oozes talent.
B0016K40KO|5.0|A DVD I've been putting-off buying for some time but I'm glad I finally broke-down and bought it.  I'm especially happy with the extras in this 2-disc set.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Get this game.  You will love it because it challenges your skill of physics and mind stretching.  Just like Angry Birds, this game is difficult enough to make you improve over times that you \\"cut the rope.\\"
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I loved the movie but the book is really a slow read.  I did not realize that the book went in so many directions.  I have wondered how a script or play write could decipher the true story line to make such a phenominal play and movie.  I will finish the book but it is not always entertaining.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The first movie in the new trilogy has all the visual majesty of LOTR, and while it never finds the same dramatic depth and true grace in tone, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey finds its own ground as an enjoyable thrill-ride. It sometimes feels too similar to a theme-park ride, with the visuals overwhelming the screen occasionally-- but for the most part, the movie finds a nice balance blending realism and the humanity of the heroes with the fantastical elements of Middle-earth. Another small problem was the film's duration: 2 hours and 45 minutes is quite beefy, and there are noticeable fillers that Jackson implemented to find that length. I don't know why he wanted it to be that long, perhaps he thought that would enhance the grandness of the movie, to complement its scale. I think it could've been at least 15 minutes shorter. But the finale is quite a feat, the cast is whimsical and likable, and the magic still holding strong. I'm very much looking forward to The Desolation of Smaug.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham's best book ever. You have to pay attention to keep up with the main characters. It's hard to fool the Feds, and I don't want to spoil the outcome in the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Really enjoyed this, just only a touch of modern day political correctness but still staying true to the time period. Great costume & story telling
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie and a great way to end the trilogy. That is about all that I can say about it.
B008Q09K2U|5.0|A racey, pacey cleverly plotted read. Topical and current. Left you wanting more and is all set to continue. Tough stuff somewhat softened by the main character - John Corey's smart quips and thoughts.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I was a big fan of comics in my younger days and to see all these charecters brought to life in one action packed movie was a LOT OF FUN. Higly recomend. I just got my blue ray-3D pyr so looking forward to watching it in 3D no.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the absolute best books I've ever read!!!  Definitely worth every minute you'll spend on it!  Great read for sure!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not for children as this is quite a sexually graphic book. I;ve read all three and it's agood read for either women or men
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Awesome!  Her voice is amazing and bring the songs to life.  Highly recommend this cd to anyone who loved her in Phantom of the Opera.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I have allthe movies in this twilight saga collection and this is another example of a fun movie to watch with a great quality picture

B009CPJHY4|5.0|The actors did such a great job in this film. I really appreciated every single minute of it and loved the characters!
1439153663|5.0|Great story and could be a true story about America's history during the slavery time of our nation. I could not put it down, it was that interesting!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have used this a lot! I have a different app on my iPhone but I'm usually charging it during the night in another room so this one I use on my Kindle in my room.
B008QI6EHQ|4.0|It is not the easiest book to understand. I believe if a person is not familiar with WW II,  it would be hard to follow the storyline.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is a great app and that's all there is to it. It might have extras that I'm not aware of but I don't care - I use it for what I want !
B005P3NPXG|5.0|Love this cd & play it a lot. Have had it for over a year & never get tired of listening to it.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|My whole family (adults, pre-teens, and us oldies) watched and loved this movie the other night. It was worth renting and I was still thinking about it the next day.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Love Tony Bennett. Such a classy &#34;man&#34; & this duet album was very good. I never get tired of listening to it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't know a thing about this app other than the fact that my grandson seems to love it and plays it all the time!
B006OAB3ME|3.0|Wasn't what I expected from Paul McCartney but don't mind listening to it once in a while. It's kinda ok.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I don't know anybody who thought this wasn't worth the price of buying, renting - or WATCHING! My whole family loved it.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Love it when different musicans come together & share their voices & talents. Very well done in Ray Charles style
076115678X|5.0|Wonderful, fabulous, and life changing are just a few adjectives I would use to describe this inspiring and informative book. I loved it! I loaned it to a friend when I was done and another friend is waiting to borrow it. Very helpful.
B001F290E4|5.0|Love the choices of songs & play it often. Have bought other cds of his & like the style of this kind of music
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a sad but realistic movie. I think the writers of the movie did a great job showing how two people can fall in love but sense society is against it, it hindered them from being together.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is my first review ever. I must say I am not a fan of the &quot;free&quot; games as they are advertised; I would rather know the price up front and have full transparency. However, this game was so well done I just had to buy it and would highly recommend it. The graphics were great, the items to be searched for were challenging, and the story line was great science fiction.  Great job and value for the price!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Rent is a great musical! Great music and a great message. I encourage everyone to watch it, no matter what your opinion is on AIDS and homosexuality.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|a awesome game with a compelling story and amazing gameplay you will not regret the price . i hope the developers make another similar game or a sequel
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Easy to use and good searches.only search engine I will use whether at home or work. There's not another better.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|We got this movie for our family movie night, and it was really great! My four-year-old son loved it, and recognized Santa and the Easter Bunny. Our teenage daughter enjoyed it as well, and my husband and I liked it enough that we didn't protest when our son wanted to watch it again the next day. There are some inside jokes that just the adults got, but they weren't offensive at all, just funny. I loved that the story wasn't just empty entertainment either, but had a good message about hope, wonder, family, and overcoming fear.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I can't stop playing it it was so fun it's you h and to collect parts to things. And have  to get three or mire Jams in a row
0553381407|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone who comes from a dysfunctional family and desires to go through the healing process.  Susan Forward does an excellent job as the author; she is very easy to understand.  The seller does an excellent job in getting this product to the customer in a reasonable amount of time AND in perfect condition.  This seller is awesome!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game is a little tricky but not hard some levels are easy but some games need easy it is a fun game I hope everybody likes it like I do
B005RKBZEI|5.0|Yes, This Delicate Thing We've Made was very ambitious and progressive. But could you really expect the next CD to be the same? I'm glad it's not! This CD is beautiful. Darren, as always, is incredible. He has a unique way of singing and writing that I'm a big fan of. It can be seen as eccentric compared to mainstream,  but that's what I like. He goes places others won't. Tackles subjects others won't. The way he describes relationships and their complexities is so eloquent. Highly recommended.
B0058SNI58|5.0|These are super comfy and super cute. Great for my constantly moving feet! Thank you Crocs for these stlylish babies!
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|GREAT ARTIST, A GREAT NEW ALBUM. A FAN THAT GOES BACK TO 1968 - 2013.  I LOVE ALL HIS WORK. JUST WONDERFUL TO HEAR HIM AGAIN.\\"DAVID BOWIE\\" BRINGS JOY TO PEOPLE.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|the movie was cute and funny.  the  quality  could  have been better  but I  also did not pay the  extra  two  dollars  out whatever for the hd.
1465001123|5.0|5 stars because it's perfect. I like this calendar because of the black and white with selective coloring and I just like Taylor Swift.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Very addictive.  Lots of levels. I had played the trial version online many times. Now with the premium I am happy happy happy.
B004GCK6XY|4.0|I ended my wait for this to come out in the U.S. in blu-ray by purchasing this European region disc. I have a region-free player so I can play it without problem.<br /><br />If you live in the U.S. and have only a region 1 player, or, alternatively, lack the knowledge and tools to extract the file as region free, then this will not work for you.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I fought with putting my photos on the Amazon Cloud Drive for almost a year and could never view them on my Kindle Fire.  Now, this works and its also easy to do.  Way to go, Amazon !
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutely love this show!! Seems like the Monday does not come soon enough:) Cannot wait for the next episode lol!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|DO not even HESITATE to read these, better than E.L James and twenty thousand percent more interesting than you can even imagine. You'll be in love, then you'll be waiting forever like we are for the third to appear.
B0099Y2YL6|3.0|There are spoilers to follow, but the plot is so absurd and chaotic it hardly matters. The writers just do what they feel like at the moment.<br />OK, here goes.  I've watched every single episode of the first three seasons of Downton Abbey (some of them twice), and I'm here to tell you it's basically pure junk. The plot(s) are hokey beyond imagining: one daughter runs off with the chauffer (a radical Irish socialist to boot), another loses her virginity to a Turk who dies during the encounter, a third is jilted at the alter by an old one-armed man, a lame valet goes to prison for murdering his wife, etc.  During the second season Matthew's fiancee conveniently dies and he is miraculously cured of his inability to walk so he can marry his true love.  These are just a few examples of the silliness of the show. The portrait of the British aristocracy (particularly the Duke or whatever he is) is unbelievable (only the incomparable Maggie Smith makes them endurable). After the penultimate episode of Season 3 I thought (hoped) it was over. Everything seemed resolved. Bates was back, married, in a new home; the gay valet was going to stay, the Irish chauffer and his baby were moving into the house, etc. But wait . . . there's more. Matthew is dead and a whole new set of questions (and facile ansers) remains.<br />As I say, all this gives a rich new meaning to \\"hokey.\\" This series isn't remotely comparable to \\"Upstairs/Downstairs,\\" let alone the original \\"Forsyte Saga.\\"<br />Still, I watched every episode and I'm sure I'll watch Season 4. So I guess one star and five stars would be equally appropriate.  I split the difference and gave it three.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It. Just. Gets. Better. Sincerely. If there was even a hesitation to buy this book and read it, you'll wonder what you were thinking about when you finish it, because it's not JUST worth the read, but worth the own. You'll read it more than once.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|My crush on John Corey remains intact!  Mr DeMille did a fantastic job of developing a story that wove together two different characters from different previous novels without missing. A beat.  I was fascinated with all that I learned about Yemen.  Great storyline, just the right amount of description, perfect timing and tension as plot unravelled.<br />Now I think I'll go back and reread Lions Game, Wildfire, UpCountry and maybe even The General's Daughter.  Thank you Mr DeMille for another perfect story!
0753539470|4.0|Raised in Mississippi, Shawn Achor grew up in privacy. When googled, there is not much to find besides that he graduated magna cum laude from Harvard and also that he continued his graduate year there. Enjoying harvard he became a counselor for 10 years after his schooling. He currently speaks at different countries spreading the word on his views of happiness. In 2008, the world's largest banks called his an expert because he helped restart forward process. he is currently the world's leading expert on his thoughts connecting success with happiness. If one looks to see his work, he is now lecturing on PBS with his show called The Happiness Advantage.<br /> The Happiness Advantage speaks on the thought process of being happy. One of his studies was the ninety percent of happiness is what one's brain thinks about the world. A personal intake of that was that the way one interacts with people and the way one thinks of people will affect if they are happy or not. If a person is around a lot of good, happy and optimist people then they will be happily influenced and vice versa. Achor shares that stress gets in the way of happiness and if one were to think of stress as a challenge instead of a struggle, happiness would not be hard to reach. He says success always changes. If one think that in order to be happy they need to be successful then the goal is unattainable. One will keep pushing to do better and never will be satisfied. Achor presents the tif people change the roles of happiness and success then everything will fall into place. In human eyes happiness comes with success but the formula needs to be reversed. When one has happiness, success comes along. Success is determined by one's thought process of happiness, but that is the wrong way to go. For example, if someone has a hobby that they enjoy and they are happy with it, they will continue to play and get better and there is success. If someone has a job and their goal is to just make money then they will keeppicking up hours to work for and become tired and never be happy. In that example the person over worked themselves trying to make money, instead of getting a job that he loved and not focusing on money. He would still make money, but he would love his job too and also be happy.<br /> To apply these ideas one could start off with a hobby the they like to do and compare it to something they do for a particular reason. Comparing the two would show that the one that is not for enjoyment is not as successful as the other, in the eyes of this person because they re not happy with it. first a person should do something they enjoy. Pick anything and go with it. Over time that person will see that it became a success just for the simple fact that it made them happy. Shawn Achor discovered this great idea to put happiness before success, and it works. everyone should watch this video because most Americans are greedy and they do things based on how successful something will be rather than how happy it makes them. To see another side view of something this great, may change the minds of some Americans causing them to change their way of thinking. In the future, one should put happiness first when doing anything because happiness bring on satisfaction, which is the true meaning of success.
B00006LLOB|5.0|I missed this one the 1st time around, but am I ever glad I finally bought it. The music is strong,raw,and gritty.This came at a time when artists were sneaking around playing on everyone elses albums.What a cast of artists being schooled by the great Howlin' Wolf.Just buy it,you wont be disappointed.....support your favorite artists.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|I love Dr. Who it is just a brilliant show! The instant video was good, however it did take some videos longer to load than others and took extra buffering time. Otherwise great show!
