B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed sitting down to indulge  myself with this captivating novel. I couldn't wait to read about which \\"cluster\\" of people the next chapter would entertain me with and how they would eventually all tie in together. There was a perfect balance between suspense, love, and tragedy!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Fun game for sure. But unlike my iPhone - there is no auto update this app on my kindle fire.  I am still stuck in Rio.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|.........Perfect in every way. Easy on the eyes, mind, and heart. Highly recommend to all who like to read the best of literature.
B000FA5STS|4.0|A story that keeps building and with some softness times thrown in. The macho men are portrayed the way they live and the tough times to have any normal family life. It is a peg turner until the end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very interesting, can not wait to see what the next room will bring.  Keeps my brain working.  My kids like it too.  They are three and five.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son &amp; I love this game! I've bought almost every costume. Hope there's another 60% sale on tokens again. When is the Halloween update coming out?
B008M721MS|5.0|makes me very happy because ppl can call me as long as i have wifi connection. Makes it easy for ppl to get hold of me in an emergency and for me to get hold of them in an emergency
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Wow spider man is solo cool I play it all the time awesome game make a second people u are all zoo great how to play the stomach and punch in search engine rankings and then kick off a cat and punch in the nuts and bolts to play the home page and please
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I don't like being interrupted by ads and constantly being told to rate this game. It's a cool game but I myself don't play games on FB.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Very predictable/cliche story about Cyndirella living rich life and analyzing her feelings towards her control freak husband -- oh, he drives me crazy, oh, i love him, I want him, oh, I am so angry at him, oh I still love him. Pathetic. There should of been only one book versus trilogy, which was just stretched in to three books to make more money for author and publishers. Still don't  understand how these books got so popular.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Omg this was the best farm game ever. I deleted the rest of my farm games cuz this is de best
0345803485|1.0|Where does one begin? When I found out these novels started as Twilight fan-fiction, I was not surprised at all. The basic plot lines are the same: the main protagonist is your shy, bumbling, awkward-yet-endearing every woman with subtle self-esteem issues - a.k.a. Bella Swan. The male counterpart is a devastatingly handsome, young (or young-looking), rich, intelligent, lonely, secretive, damaged and often misunderstood diamond in the rough, waiting for the right woman to penetrate his defenses. In other words, an amalgam of what this writer apparently thinks are all the qualities women look for in an ideal mate, wrapped up in washboard abs - a.k.a. Edward Cullen.  They stumble upon one another in what can only be described as a &#34;meet-cute,&#34; the female protagonist finding herself in an awkward and/or dangerous situation which serves to break the ice with the seemingly unattainable male counterpart. They are initially wary of one another, with a couple passive-aggressive exchanges that almost inexplicably and immediately develop into sexual tension. There is a short push-and-pull courtship, during which the female's self-esteem issues surface and she can scarcely fathom how such an Adonis would show any interest in her. Suddenly, it all turns into a romance for the ages, where the characters' emotional well-being depends wholly on being with one another. At this point, we find ourselves witness to the male protagonist's reluctant and dramatic revelation of the deep, dark, game-changing secret he had been harboring all this time, as it was sinisterly lurking beneath the surface. He awaits rejection, only to be met with an understanding and nurturing response from the female, wanting to save the poor, beautiful, damaged creature. Despite such a hopeful response, the couple barely weathers ensuing conflicts after a brief period of uncertainty. Finally, in the dramatic crescendo, the characters decide to put their reservations aside and take a chance on true love. Fin.  All of that hackneyed tripe aside, the repetition in this book is maddening. As others have mentioned, the main characters (in this I am including that ever annoying inner-goddess) spend half of the book blushing, flushing, breath hitching, pressing mouths into hard lines, oh crapping, tilting heads and jeezing. Also, the male character is annoyingly patronizing toward the female. Even though their ages range within a few years of each other, he acts as though he is old enough to be her father. And let's not even talk about the disgustingly stalkerish/controlling behavior Christian exhibits at even the slightest hints of Ana exercising her agency over complying with his demands. The only thing mildly entertaining was the email exchanges. Even then, some of that cheese could have been scaled back.  Color me amazed that this book was released by a major publishing house. Did the author even have an editor? The overall tone is so cringe-inducing and juvenile, as previous reviewers have mentioned you would think it was written by a 12-year-old. It is pure pre-pubescent fantasy, chock full of disgustingly controlling, possessive and highly problematic behavior toward the female character that only a pre-teen would find swoon-worthy. Not only that, the characters don't earn their relationships. Also, I don't understand the necessity of Ana's virginity. Why is virginity requisite for a character to believably be presented as &#34;virtuous&#34;? Thankfully I didn't actually buy the book and merely borrowed it, as I had to force myself to get through the final few chapters. It is a shame that this author suddenly finds herself an insanely rich woman, having piggy-backed off of someone else's work.
B005P1YCNK|4.0|Darren takes some of the best ideas from the thought-leaders he's interviewed over the years at Success and brought it all together in this one book. A very good read.
B00ET2ODX0|3.0|This is the watered (dumbed) down international version that was in USA theaters this August. Import the TRUE version from Hong Kong  which represents the directors vision. And don't worry its Region Free & of course is encoded with DTS HD MASTER AUDIO 7.1!
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|It doesn't have as much interpersonal action as I prefer, but this movie is a lot of fun, and very much worth the purchase price.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|this app is a good app for being free however I find the tutorial unnecessary for how simple and childishly easy it is
B008ALAHA4|5.0|My MacBook was stolen and the idiots left the power cord. When buying my replacement, I did not realize that the charger had changed. I was happy to pay the ten bucks to have a power charger downstairs as well as up.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have the word with me and its easy to access during my time of need.<br />I love being able to access the Bible electronically.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Excellent game.  Fast paced, and addicting.  One of the few match games that is actually fun and entertaining.  Tried the free version, and I liked it so much, I bought it!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|This has to be my favorite movie. I watch it all the time. This movie has so many good qualities, but if I could only name 5 they would be:<br />-GREAT MUSIC. I love the music for this movie, not only the instrumental background music but also the synthpop music used.<br />-GREAT ACTORS. The movie had several great main actors, but there were also many extras - zombies and humans! Each zombie had zombie makeup that was very well done.<br />-THE CHARACTERS. The characters were all very interesting and thought-out. (If you pay attention to the names of the characters, you will see that they resemble the names of characters from Romeo and Juliet! For example, R=Romeo, Julie=Juliet.)<br />-THE HUMOR. This movie had several moments that made me laugh out loud.<br />-THE STORYLINE. I call it a zom-rom-com. The story seems to be a dystopian version of Romeo and Juliet, if you think about it, with the names of the characters, as well as a forbidden love.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this movie. I have to warn you that there are several disturbing scenes, since this IS a zombie movie.
B001EC3JME|2.0|sent it back because it did not work for me. it may work for someone else but not for my flashlight.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great hidden object game. Updates are nice because it keeps the game changing.  Love how you don't have to pay to play
B000NY17J6|5.0|I have several of Linda Ronstadt's CDs, but none of her greatest hits. Ever since she went on TV and spoke of her debilitating ailment, I knew that I had to have her greatest hits, and it's not disappointing! I've played it in my car over and over again, and I realize how lucky we are to have had a singer like her in our generation.
1452126577|2.0|Whether on you Tube, Facebook, on television, in books, calendars in advertising, Grumpy Cat has millions of fans! But nobody looks behind the scenes. Nobody is interested how the cat feels like. What the two owners publish and show with photos on the internet, that Grumpy Cat is a kitten of two normal domestic cats, is just ridiculous!  If you look at the color of the fur of both parents, it is genetically impossible to have a kitten looking like Grumpy Cat. This cat suspect to be a snowshoe Munchkin cat.<br />These cats have short legs and other genetic defects. A breed with a lot of suffering for the animal.<br />Grumpy Cat can't jump and climb like a normal healthy cat, or walking  properly. On the you Tube video of Tardar Sauce  you can clearly see how the cat staggers when walking. Is it any wonder? Even normal sitting is not possible for it.<br />What's more: The many photo shootings and all the hype is for the poor animal pure stress.  And so sweet and also funny to see, how it looks so grim and bad mood.......<br />In the U.S., one finds at least here and there some critical voices of animal rights activists, but these are often silenced. Sure, when millions are at stake, critical voices harm the good image!<br />Who really loves cats, this hype should not support yet. Grumpy Cat needs some rest and not further drag around in public. However, if all the Grumpy products continue to buy en masse, all the hype will continue. Poor cat!<br />I which you a better life!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game in history of games. The only suggestion that I can make is more of the costumes cost bananas instead of gru points or the ones that cost gru points cost less gru points
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This was a creative short novel but I felt as if I were reading a story out of Grimm's Fairy Tales.  It kept my interest but I wondered if their were a deeper meaning that I was unable to discover.
B0063M22QO|5.0|really enjoy playing all types of mahjong this one is quick playing and I hate writing reviews but just a few more words to go bye
B00DGN51O8|4.0|This is a fun movie with a predictable ending, but the trip to get there is  engaging. You feel like you want to slap and hug the appropriate characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a awesome game and I like how the minions go bananas in the background in minion beach there is none to fight and the longer slade and the banana ring at the end of the slade
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a wonderfully written book,very poetic in style.  I wanted it turn out well for the characters because I really cared about them.  My only suggestion is ti try not to spend too much time between each reading because there are many characters and time changes and it can be confusing.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I am not so sure that it needed to be 2hours and 20 minutes, and I am not fond of the idea that New York once again gets slammed by aliens.  However, the action was phenomenal, the special effects rocked, and the characters were great.  Overall, it was an awesome show and I can't wait to see the next one.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|This isn't a baseball movie! It's a story about believing, it's a story of faith. Maybe a wish to go back to simpler time. I think we all want to heal old wounds. Just sit,smile and enjoy the show!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game ever on portables.I think everyone would play its a very good game I love the game yep a good game

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Never a dull moment... hard to put down.  Listened to most of it during a road trip but interwove it with the kindle using wispersync audible.  It was an upgrade for only $.99 more, great deal and loved the narration.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|It gives all the information i want in a simple and fast way.<br />I keep track of all the news i want and it shows them to me fast and in a great ui.

B001XV3LSS|4.0|This film is well acted and directed. Jody Foster does a brilliant job, I highly recommend it for all ages.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I needed a new alarm clock and got this one for free to try out. It works great, just like an alarm clock should. It shows the time and rings when it is supposed to.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. I haven't finished it but it's an amazing book so far. It is my most favorite book out of all the books I've read.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I like the my camera I reckon a mend it for you and ever body I like it so much I love it
B000AJIF4E|4.0|using these headphones with my ipad, great sound for music and videos. cancels outside noise really well. like hearing old music for the first time.<br /><br />i think i damaged the plug by leaving it in ipad while in my backpack. Sony replaced no problem.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|If you like hunger games then you'll enjoy this book. The first 5/6 chapters are confusing then the book gets you sucked in.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Never have read a book before on power of attraction/positive thinking that explains it so well.  I have shared this book with quite a few people that feel the same way.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the 2nd time reading this book and I was just as unable to put it down the second time as I was the first!!!
B00E9P959O|5.0|I love the new mixes of these brilliant songs, all written in the worst of times. My car stereo speakers love the new mixes too, since playing the old ones sounds like my speakers are about to blow! &#34;From first to last the peak is never passed&#34;, you might say. 'Love this brilliant re-painting of an underrated masterpiece of dark thoughts. It's a bit like reading Poe at times. You feel so bad for the poet, but reading the poetry is a wonderful experience that stirs the soul.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game from the time I had it on my iPod and know I have,it on my kindle love it
0316044695|1.0|I can't say I'm an expert, but I know what it's like to lose guys so I feel for him and all the families and friends involved, but their position was blown, regardless.  Hopefully they weren't really goofing w/ each other so that they could be heard, but I don't know why there was such a big deal made about whether they should've killed the locals that found them in the first place.  If those guys didn't come home there would have been people out looking anyway, not to mention the attention unaccompanied animals roaming around would've drawn.  And since they were found again by the enemy it makes me wonder why they didn't immediately call in, change their positions and get to an extract point as soon as possible, assuming there was one.  As many times as he suggested that he and the seals are so elite, it seems to me that there must be something more to the real version, b/c hopefully so many lives weren't lost as a result of such an amateurish mistake.
0762451319|5.0|I loved the little box the items came in. Bought 2, one for a gift. Both of us were pleased with the products. The pendant is lovely and the temporary tattos were great. I was able to take it with me to make a permanent one on my wrist.<br />They came separately and one box was slightly dented, but no damage inside. Recommend this seller
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I haven't loved a Queensryche album this much since Operation: Mindcrime, and that is no exaggeration! I loved and still love Promised Land and Empire, but everything in between was (sorry, guys) a complete waste of time. This album truly shows who the winner is, creatively (referring to recent events). Also I'm glad I bought the Deluxe version with the live tracks, not only because without them the album would have been way too short, but also because they are f-ing fantastic renditions of those great old tunes!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I'll probably read the whole series all over again when I finish it!<br />The books so far are amazing. I can't wait to read the rest of them.
1468179993|4.0|This book covered the a TED Talk speech very well.  I chose the 4 star rating because Donovan could have went into more detail on some chapters like the &#34;Transitions&#34; within a speech.  I like the writing style, very easy to follow.  I dislike the little amount of information; more information or exercises would have beefed this book up to a 5 star.  I would recommend this book to folks who want a book handy to read to completion on a short airline flight.
B006QVRUS2|4.0|Great movie at a great value, needed to be added to my blue ray collection. Very good cast with excellent chemistry.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|If you are the type who prefers to over think a movie rather than sitting back and enjoying the ride, please don't spoil this adventure for others with deep analysis paralysis comments.  For certain this movie shares attributes similar to those of MIB and Ghostbusters but it also has its own original flair.  It is non stop action and the characters are quite entertaining.  The hour and a half flew by.  Character outfitting and CGI realism detail are not what this movie is about so be fair to everyone and just ask yourself if you enjoyed it.  I did!  I'm posting this as I almost postponed watching this thinking my husband would not want to see it due to the average review rating.  I am so glad we did.  We were both chuckling throughout it and others deserve to enjoy this flick as we have.  This is Kim posting, not Dan.  So; sit back, grab your popcorn and just prepare to have fun!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the book but I hate how it ends on another cliff hanger. But overall the book is fantastic.
B00005N6KG|3.0|When i ran, these things would fall back behind my head. I had to place a tall pony tail waaaayyy on top of my head to catch them from totally falling off my skull.
B007QWF26C|5.0|Awesome movie, needed to purchase it on blue ray to complete my set. Was very pleased with the price and quality.
B00993I6D2|1.0|Not at all what I was expecting. Suppose to be a &#34;big brother&#34; movie, and it is to some degree, but movie is more about the guy trying to get laid than anything. Waste of time.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I liked it...great for passing time on the toilet, or sitting in a waiting room, or waiting for bacon to burn...then again the bacon may have burned because of this fun distraction...NOOOO...wasted bacon = bad.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|Great movie...my favorite musical!  Fun movie to share with others who have seen it or not...would highly recommend to anyone wanted to be entertained...
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I love Muse and I think this one of their best albums. There isn't one bad sons. A must see live!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A perfect read, I don't think Stephen could have done it better.  Weaving the old in with the new in seamless fashion, I couldn't wait to get to the end.
B00005O5CM|3.0|same as the legally blonde 2 would not buy for myself.  Not my type of move. I don't care for this type of movie
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The ending was so unexpected and yet, nothing runs smoothly for this family. I will not give away the ending, but highly recommend one watches this entire series from the beginning. Was so happy to see it available on Amazon Prime. Pays to have that membership. Has saved me a fortune as I just can't get enough of the dramas. This series is probably the best ever done on any network, but the BBC certainly knows how to do it right. The drama never stops with a few shocks along the way. See what it was like to live at the turn of the 19th-20th century. The story never grows old as seen through new eyes. Family togetherness is the answer and sometimes the problem. The staff of servants are the best. Think it was easy to be a maid or kitchen helper or footman? No, but somethings still haven't improved to this day. Does money guarantee a happy life....NO! This is a must see. Watch before January when the next season premiere.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Makes you think.  Good game to have.  I recommend.  Got it as a free app.  Glad I got it. I play every day.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I was a little disappointed.  The other reviewers were right.  Both Fliss and Lottie were kind of stupid.  I wish there was more if a story line other than Fliss trying to stop the wedding.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This is wonderful....love all of his stuff....this one is now one of my favorites!<br />Play it over and over....sometimes daily!!!!
0689835604|3.0|Flaps are easy open and make identity of object easy to find. Can compare book to body and identify body parts easily.
B00F52YOPA|3.0|I enjoyed this app it was different from the usual Hidden Objects games and a bit more challenging. As I am a &#34;Silver Surfer&#34; I like games you use your brain but don't have to race through.<br />  Mavis Hutt
B0027MJU00|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with Gone Girl after all of the hype. This book I could hardly put down, I just had to know who the killer was and the ending did not disappoint.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Enough said. I have read every book that I can find written by Nicholas Sparks. He can't write them fast enough to keep me supplied.<br />Romance at it's very best with a little mystery thrown in for interest. Hard to put down once you start reading.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game, especially when I need a diversion. I enjoy playing while my daughter's in dance class or during my daily commute.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is the bomb! It keeps me occupied and you can pay anybody without waiting on your friends to play. I love it!!
0679809015|5.0|Easy for little hands to hold and turn pages. She knows all the sounds.<br />Bright colors attract attention and flaps are easy open.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I don't understand all of the negative feedback about this movie.  There was good acting and a good plotline.  A lot of sci-fi these days are so action centered that they forget the personal aspects of the movie.  I actually enjoyed this movie more than I enjoyed Iron Man III, and I really like Robert Downy Junior's work.  The story centers on a father/son relationship, as well as a family relationship, in a military household.  And of course there is the whole Sci-Fi aspect with monster's, advanced tech and some pretty good CGI graphic scenes.  I do have a military background, mom was a Navy brat, and my Uncle and I were in the Marines; so maybe I understand it better?  Honestly though, I think that some of the criticism of the movie is shallow.  My hat is off to Will Smith and Jaden Smith for a job well done.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Obviously, for everyone that has seen this movie no review of it is necessary; it's a classic. I got a pleasant surprise though when my kids sat through the entire movie and liked it. It was funny to let them see what kids from  an older generation did. My boy didn't even know what 2 for flinching meant Too funny.
141694737X|5.0|Fun time story with popular animal illustrations.<br />Learn names of animals quickly and their relationship in size and where they live.<br />.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|A lot better than #2. It made up for the crappines of two. Can't wait until they ditch the lead and go with someone new and better
B00F91RYL8|3.0|And I have no idea what it was.  I did notice a complete lack of chemistry between the male and female lead.  It was entertaining but not as good as it might have been.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|BEST Star Trek Movie yet! Can't wait for the next one! I've watched it several times now, still not tired of it!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great read...this was the first book I read if this series after watching Game of Thrones on HBO.  Can't wait to start the next one.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|i have used this for 2 years. now I need to upgrade but don't have access to Play store. Is it a developer issue or Amazon?  WTF?  Outcome: Uninstalled and saved 27meg.
0345803507|5.0|Amazing! Love this trilogy. I couldn't put any of the books down. I've never been so addicted to a book in my life. EL James is a rockstar!
B001DF68MA|2.0|Cool concept but if you are short and need access to the cross bar in order to get your feet on the ground this wont work for you.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Awesome app. Very accurate forecasts so far for me in several locations including the beaches over the summer. I depend on this app every morning when deciding what to wear. It hasn't failed me yet!
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Awesome scare i watched it with my kid and we had fun'! So it was worth it check it of you like horror movies . I love em
B003477DVK|5.0|This is one of those movies that become so endearing to those who ever watch it. I own a copy. When it comes to purchasing a movie, I am very selective with my choices. I personally do not like vulgarity and profanity, so anybody that comes to visit me,that person can pick any movie to watch from my reppertoire.<br /><br />I absolutely love the movie!!
B002QVZ71I|5.0|One of my favorites for sure! Most enjoyable movie and a small history lesson to boot! Gary and Tom at there best
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I love this series, but didn't want to spend a whole lot for the season.  It came on time, brand new in the wrapping.
0062082353|5.0|As a war veteran I was suprised how open and honest the story was of the iner conflicts of those who we send<br /> out to kill the enemy. Too bad there was no after note on how tragic Chris Kyle died after he left the seal.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My 7 yr old loves the Minecraft app on the iPad & loves Legos, so I thought he would love this, too. The pieces are so small & a little hard for him. We will save this for another year or so. He doesn't usually have any trouble with other games or Legos that say they're for slightly older kids, so my bad.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have spent many hours enjoying this game as there are multiple puzzles that require logic and prudence. Well worth the investment in time and concentration.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Sean Patrick's book  uses Nikola Tesla's life achievements to write about imagination, how to pursue ideas and make dreams come true, and how to change history in the process. When we talk about these topics these days, we mostly speak of Steve Jobs; people have forgotten Nikola Tesla. Funnily enough I had taught, better touched upon, a tiny part of Tesla's work when I taught TV-Productions; namely that he was the true inventor of the radio. Still I did not have the vaguest idea of all of Tesla's accomplishments.<br />Sean Patrick's book 'Imagination and the Man That Invented the 20th Century ' enlightened me.<br /><br />It is a fabulous read, exciting, and riveting: Of Tesla's great life-long feud with Edison, of manipulation and tricks, of money schemes, and of major wars about power and reputation. In those days, owning and financing the right invention could make a man/company forever rich. The reader understands how and why \\"the famous financiers and companies became great and profitable and are still around\\": General Electric, the Westinghouse Corporation, Western Union, J.P. Morgan , Lord Rothschild, John Jacob Astor, and W.K. Vanderbilt. Not always were the methods clean and Sean Patrick also tells their dirty tricks. .<br /><br />One sentence at the beginning of this book struck me in particular:<br />\\"Opportunities are whispers, not foghorns.\\"<br /><br />Sean Patrick tells of many whispers and how it got to be that they are still being heard today.<br />5 stars and highly recommend to all.<br /><br />Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger
B003F5WOEC|5.0|Love Black Keys, Love Brothers!  When we started a vinyl collection this year Brothers was HIGH on my list of must haves.  You cannot go wrong with these guys in this format!
091581112X|5.0|This is an amazing book for those who are ready to heal their own lives and have some answers to their long asked questions.
B000FBFMZ2|3.0|Too bad Richard Morgan is fascinated with grossly perverted sex --like the scene with the dog-- his plot was rich enough to not have to indulge in this kind of cheap tricks. It seems many modern SF writers think that they have to go overboard in the description of acts of perversion. This novel didn't need that to be a riveting reading.
B00536OCZA|3.0|Dark Side is my favorite Floyd album.  I purchased a like new album from a third party and when it arrived it had no album cover (just the paper cover) and the vinyl itself had lots of little nicks and cuts that show up as pops in the sound.<br /><br />I realized I had unwittingly ordered an album that is very old, and for its age, its in beautiful condition.  But I wanted to order a brand new Dark Side with fresh cover art and rich sound.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a great game to lift up your day with excitment of being a teen, a robot, a ninja even a zombie running around being run over by trains and being chased by a fat cop with his dog, oh and just a word to the makers, GREAT JOB u guys u nailed it big time.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|Read a lot of hype so ordered the book, kindle version to check it out.  It was ok, certainly not all it was cracked up to be in my opinion.  It started out good, some good ideas, etc...but then second half of book was kind of like rattling on....insecure guy just goin on and on about his issues....2nd half of book was disappointing.  Like he was in therapy & we were the therapists

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Honestly the only reason I read 50 shades of grey was because it was a new York Times bestseller and I everyone has been talking about it. All of the sexual activity in this book is a little much but the relationship that develops between Mr Grey and Anastasia steel is a liter duo you will never forget. Dark secrets. Lust and a hope for romance are what make 50 shades of grey worth reading. And by the way i am an 18 year old male and  overly rarely read romance novels and it was a refreshing change
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This book was just ok. Starting to be predictable. Same stuff, different page. Quick read. Go out and get it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book has more suffering and pain for everyone in the book. And it handles how it changes each characters. In addition is also deals with what happens when you replace one tyrant with another. This is far more than a regular teen read. I highly recommend this series to everyone.

B009KKLQVS|4.0|The 50th Anniversary Concert has been scaled back to a limited number of songs. Many with the great Brain Wilson Harmonies left out. This version of the Beach Boys will never pass this way again as Mike Love quickly fired Brian Wilson and since he (Mike Love) owns the Beach Boy Name he quickly resumed touring with his band which besides Mike has only one other Beach Boy from the 60's. The Beach Boys days are numbered with all the original members in their 70's. This video should have been the ultimate tribute to a six decade career but it's poorly produced in places and gives little credit by leaving out the great music written by Brian WIlson for the Album &#34;Thank God for the Radio&#34; which is close to a masterpiece.

0446547573|3.0|I am going to preface this by saying that I normally prefer historical romance novels (works by exceptionally intelligent and emotionally attuned authors like Lisa Kleypas, Julie Quinn, and lately Sherry Thomas), so it is possible that my expectations do not match other readers'.  I don't think that I necessarily require a love scene when reading a romance novel (whether it be contemporary or historical), but for me, it was necessary in Safe Haven.  Unfortunately all we got were **Spoiler Alert!!!! [horrific sex scenes with the abusive ex-husband.  If Sparks is going to include those traumatic occurrences and a whole lot of violence, then I needed to see Erin/Katie heal through attaining an emotionally fulfilling sexual relationship with Alex.  Their relationship felt a bit rushed, shallow, and incomplete for my taste.] **<br /><br />I found this book to be mediocre in the quality of the writing.  Much of the language and word choices were bland or lacked specificity.  I just expect my author's to be more intelligent and better edited than I am.  Perhaps that is unreasonable.  I didn't feel enough chemistry between the main two characters.  Those are just some of the things that bothered me.  It wasn't the worst book I have ever read by far, and there were a lot of things that I did like about it.  Some of these things are Spoilers . . . Katie struck me as a strong and resourceful person who grew throughout the novel.  I also like her relationship with Alex's children.  **Big Spoiler I like that Katie is the one who ends up saving the day more or less in the end, rather than Alex just swooping in and protecting her.<br /><br />All and all, for people who like a romance novel with no graphic sex scenes, this may work for you.  I left the experience wishing I hadn't wasted my time.

B00EP22QKG|5.0|As a long time follower since those wonderful 70's with THE RUNAWAYS,to today with Unvarnished 2013 has been a bumpy but GREAT ride with these wonderful people. Yes, there has been a new record  gap from 2006 Sinner to Unvarnished 2013 but as any JETT fan will know Joan Jett & The Blackhearts were not in hiding, they have been touring non-stop testing new songs at their live shows, and the movie The Runaways etc.<br /><br />I know I was hearing Hard To Grow Up, TMI, at shows before the new cd came out. I was happy with what I was hearing at the shows, plus the hits of course with Crimson & Clover, Bad Rep, Do you wanna touch, I LOVE ROCK N ROLL just to name a few, I will always want to hear these no matter what.<br /><br />Unvarnished I love on a few levels.<br /><br />1. Joan Jett & The Blackhearts are back with all NEW music, like Joan Jett has said everyone is involved in<br />  Unvarnished<br /><br />2. I too with many, many others can relate to this cd, whether it's loss of a family, friend, pets, to Super Storm<br />  Sandy back in 2012, this is a cd that touches down on a lot of different subjects. Based on what life is<br />  really all about. You will not be disappointed!<br /><br />I must say I am very happy on a few different notes. I was able to score a ticket to the Unvarnished cd release party that took place in the wonderful city that never sleeps NYC at the Santos Party House on Oct 2 2013 and to hear these songs live and to be apart of the cd release party was a blast.<br /><br />And yes as a follower from The Runaway era, Joan Jett has gotten only better over the years, playing, singing, they have been touring non-stop, that's why I have had the chance to see them live over the years.<br /><br />Can you believe in just a few short years Joan Jett will be in the music business for 40years and Blackheart Records will be celebrating 35 years soon as well. Wow, and the great music catalog out there. So many wonderful songs<br /><br />So, for me, I havebeen riding this wave with them, of course with some bumps, but mostly with happiness.<br /><br />To Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, you all out did yourself with Unvarnished, every song is truly incredible,<br />I love you all and I too am very proud of this cd called UNVARNISHED<br /><br />Fondly A very happy fan<br /><br />Pamela L.

B003Y5H5FG|5.0|First, I must confess that I am as picky about my horror movies as I am about my sic-fi. I don't want gore just for the sake of it any more than I want special effects just because there's a big huge budget and the \\"powers that be\\" think they don't need a story if the effects can blow the roof off of the theater. I want my blood and guts in service of the story and served up to me in a context. I want character development and a plot that'll keep me on the edge of my seat. In short, I want substance and I want it all to be compelling because I get more than a little cranky when it's not. Jeepers Creepers had me so freaked out I had to watch it in the middle of the afternoon and even then I still knew I'd be jumpy as a cat for days and Victor Salvo (writer and director) made that movie with almost NO budget but clearly knew where and what to spend it on. Fright Night delivers on all levels and in a number of ways it exceeds my expectations.<br /><br />The screenplay for Fright Night was written by Marti Noxon who's spent a lot of time working in conjunction with Joss Whedon so the storyline and dialogue are rock solid. And, as far as I'm concerned, the film was perfectly cast as well. Nothing makes me happier than watching a group of actors who are clearly having the time of their lives on a project and you can see evidence of that in the chemistry and performances of everyone involved. Furthermore, I love the respect the remake shows by giving a \\"walk-on\\" role to Chris Sarandon who played the vampire in the original. However, I really appreciate that this version has been updated and done so with both intelligence and humor. The original was a little more campy which worked well for it at that time but I honestly believe the remake is sassier and more satisfying.<br /><br />The long and short of it is that Fright Night is a smart, witty, fierce piece of filmmaking and delivers a great bang for the bucks it asks you to put out. As I said in my title; it made me wantto run right out and set myself on fire and how many movies can you really say that about?! Buy it and see for yourself. It's going to hold up well. The smart ones always do.

And I wish the characters and the boards didn't cost so many coins. But the game is fun and it is a fun time passer. I like the new powerups. Overall, Subway Surfers is a pretty good game.

John Green did an amazing job and I feel like everyone needs to read this book at some point in their life.

B0035YDM9E|5.0|This book taught me a great deal about economics in America. We are living in a time when the gap between the rich and the poor is as large as it has ever been, and growing larger every day.<br /><br />I thought I understood most of what there was to know about this situation, but this book taught me that I still had a lot to learn. In particular, it taught me about a concept that Stiglitz calls rent.<br /><br />Back in the day, when we lived in a great American Democracy, there was a huge economic engine driven by the American people that generated a great deal of wealth. There was a general consensus that our wealth should be shared by everyone. In particular, we believed we were a middle class country, and the excess wealth that was being generated was poured, by and large, into the pockets of the middle class. It was used to create jobs, to educate our populace, and to create public works that benefited everyone. America has never been a good place to be poor, but it has been a great place to be middle class. No longer.<br /><br />Over the last 30 odd years, since the Reagan election, the money that once created jobs for the middle class has found its way bit by bit into the pockets of the rich. If there is a little excess money floating around, it was once pushed back into public works projects, into education, into jobs: it was used to grow our economy.<br /><br />Now that money goes one place: into the pockets of the rich. It does no one but the rich any good. You might think I'm exaggerating. I am not. The rich have taken most of the country's profits, stolen it from the middle class and the poor, and put it in their own pockets. Their wealth has grown rapidly over the last thirty years, everyone else has seen their wealth stagnate or decline. Money that was once used to drive our economy is now used to line the pockets of the rich.<br /><br />Their trick is simple: the rich have convinced Americans to hate their own government. Why do they do this? Because there is only one way to funnel profits into job creation, into public works, into education, into the hands of the middle class: it has to be done by government. There is no other way. Very few corporations or wealthy individuals are going to freely take their money in significant proportions and use it to build a highway, or a tunnel from New York to New Jersey, an educational institution for the poor, a clean energy system, or anything else that does not benefit them directly. All the rich had to do was smear the mechanism used to generate wealth for the middle class, and then they were free to pocket all that change. They took it as their due. They took it as rent.<br /><br />The rich have seen their wealth multiply time and again. Their profits over the last thirty years are up twenty, thirty, in some cases one hundred percent or more. Many of the wealthy have seen their wealth double and then double again. In the meantime, the incomes of the middle class and poor are mostly stagnant, and many people have seen their wealth decline.<br /><br />This is called taking rents. If there is a little excess profit laying around somewhere, the wealthy see it as their income: they take it as rent just as a landlord takes rent from a renter.<br /><br />I am not an economist, and I can only summarize what is described in great technical detail in this book. It's heavy going at times, but this is one book about economics that is worth reading. It describes the disease that lies at the heart of our country's dysfunction. Our middle class country has been turned into a plutocracy. This book describes how it happened and what must be done to stop it.<br /><br />The point is not that just that this is unfair. It is not just that it is corrupt. This malignancy is eating at the heart of what was once the greatest country on earth. We are destroying our great country, we are destroying the democratic principles of equality that have made this country great. We are doing so by letting the rich take our wealth.<br /><br />\\"All men are created equal.\\" We manifested that concept by refusing to let our wealth accumulate in the pockets of the rich. Most of us worked together to create that wealth and so we should all share it. Not share it equally, for some contribute more than others. But share it reasonably, so that everyone in America has a chance to participate in our democracy.ng the rich take our wealth.<br /><br />\\"All men are created equal.\\" We manifested that concept by refusing to let our wealth accumulate in the pockets of the rich.

B0091THDOM|4.0|Your interest in this case is likely a function of aesthetics, convenience and cost.<br /><br />I normally use a rather expensive case to provide maximum protection combined with easy access to answer the phone.  But, I confess, the thing is bulky and ugly as sin.<br /><br />This pouch from Snugg is truly gorgeous.  It's the kind of thing you'd display proudly.  On the other hand, you are protecting an expensive phone with just a layer of leather and you can't actually answer the phone without popping out of the very snug-fitting case with a little strap.<br /><br />If you carry your phone in a purse, the protection level is likely adequate.  I carry mine in a pants pocket, so I'm reluctant to use it regularly.<br /><br />It's really a question of functionality vs beauty.

B0010SKUYM|2.0|Somehow I slogged through this book. I guess I just kept hoping something would happen and I can't understand why this book is so highly rated.  I just finished the Wheel of Time series and was looking for another great series to get into.<br /><br />If you like a book that is 98% dialogue and 2% action this book is for you.
0060936223|5.0|It is very well written, interesting, raw and touching, the best book I read in a long time, and in the same time very sad because it's about a generation that sold its soul to the devil to become famous. Unlike (the invoked) Michelangelo...Fortunately, Patti and Sam Shepard, just to name a few, kept it all together.<br /><br />The story made me care for Patti Smith, but not so much for the man she loved so much, Robert M, the gay photographer who hustled to pay his bills and in the end sold himself to a much older benefactor, who eventually found fame picturing and glorifying porn, S $ M and all the dark forms of gay sexuality, ultimately dying of AIDS as a 'celebrity' -- the type that will mean nothing in 500 years, while Michelangelo will still blaze. I have much more respect for the equally talented souls who are not totally amoral in order to reach 'fame' and who see art as illumination, not titillation.

B0084IG7KC|4.0|I did not intend to ever see this movie, but my niece had her heart set on seeing it and so I took her expecting to be grossed out.  The thought of young people hunting and killing each other was repulsive to me.  However, this movie demonstrated what could happen if a group of demented, power-hungry people gained the power to control everyone else's lives.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  This movie was all about sacrifice, love, hate and the fact that desperate people will do desperate things to stay alive.  I was very impressed by Jennifer Lawrence and her incredible portrayal of a young lady who held her family together and made the ultimate sacrifice to keep her sister alive.  I loved the ending when she and Josh refused to play by the rules and instead chose to play by their own rules.  They both lived or they both died.  I can't wait for the next installment.<br /><br />The blu ray was excellent.  Audio and video quality were top quality.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book until the ending. I thought the book was really well written. No doubt that Gillian Flynn can weave a detailed, edge-of-your-seat plot, but the ending was weak. I felt the same way I did when I finished reading Mockingjay, the third novel of the Hunger Games trilogy. It was as if each author got tired of writing and just ended it.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I like to write reviews right when I end books because my emotions are fresh. I had so many different emotions while reading this I don't know where to start except to say it's a cross between Fatal Attraction and the Lacey Peterson / every other 'woman disappearing' story that you see on Nancy Grace. However the book took me through so many love it and hate it sequences that it's difficult for me to not at least give it 3.5 stars. 4 stars for if I didn't hate it so much but that's because of the excellent writing making me invest in the characters. Read the book. Decide for yourself but stick with it - it's a whirlwind.

9382951008|4.0|I liked this book very much although I still find that his first novel &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; is my favorite because of its circular composition.I felt the newest novel was rather less successful in handling the array of characters presented, although it is clearly an attempt to go in a different direction from the two previous books, which should be applauded.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Amazing book!! Well worth every single penny!! Best book I've read in a long time, even cried in the end.

0807014273|5.0|Dr. Frankl is both likeable and honest.  His account of his sufferings is very meticulously described.  His story of spiritual triumph over physical and mental pain is a life-changing read.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a great item at the price.  It gives and easy way to play youtube or netflix easily through your tv, using a phone, tablet or laptop.  It lacks the bells and whistles of Apple TV or simliar products, but costs much less.  It will allow you to cast any tab from Google Chrome to the TV but there is a delay, so this is not good for streaming video outside of Youtube or Netflix.  Hopefully, they will add some features in the future.
0230754686|5.0|This book will stay with you.  It is a story of pain, luck, and ultimately, freedom.  If you like history, biography, or just a really good story, then you will not be able to put it down.
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|... it's very hard to play on small (less than 7&quot;) screens since you're going to miss lots of details and objects, so, scoring high is impossible.<br />The overall appearance is good, spooky and with its own style. I'm glad they have 3 type of gameplay since this adds to the overall experience and life extension of the game itself.<br />In the end,overall I'd recommend this game, but you should be aware that on small screens you're going to have troubles playing.
B00BMKDTNC|1.0|This book came in great condition and in a prompt manner.  It is autographed by &#34;Robert Jordan&#34; which is impossible because he died after book eleven was written.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is the best video download for YouTube I've seen yet. And the TubeMate website CORRECTLY says there are lots of fake clones of this application (ALL the versions on Google Play for instance), and not only do most of the clones not work, they are in fact Trojan horses for various forms of maliware and adware. This application DOES have adds, but I for one do not find them intrusive as they only appear within the application at the top of the screen, and this both keeps the app free plus doesn't slow the app down. ALSO in over 2GB of downloads I've seen so far ZERO porn adds. Not sure why others have, perhaps they should look at their own web-browsing history as to the reaso as adds areally usually targeted based on user activity.<br /><br />As for the pros with this app, 1-you get fast download speed that downloads in the background allowing multitasking (you can track the progress in the menu download history), 2-ability to do up to 2 downloads simultaneously, 3-ability to select different download quality's (the Max based on the source video quality), this allows one to save space by selecting lower quality video if you don't have a lot of space (it usually still looks great BTW), 4-both app-specific and general YouTube search options, 5-enhanced fast download for devices that can support it (as an option from preferences), 6-a multitude of options to customize your user experience (most of which are shown to you when you first use the app in a short and easy to understand tutoria), 7-decent video player options for the videos you've downloaded (with this or other applications), and finally 8-the ability to choose the location (internal memory or external SD card, and which specific file that you wish)) both for downloading and playback. That last one is a real time saver for me as my device only has 5GB memory, but I have a 32GB SD card, and some HD 1080P videos can be as large as 100MB or more.<br /><br />As for the cons,<br />Not really any I've seen. Well other than newer videos from Vivo won't download, but that is a &quot;feature&quot; of Vivo jackasses not this application (consider it like copy-protection as found on DVDs and Blue Ray disks). Otherwise everything is as it should be, as others have said, easy to understand icons and functions, good for the novice to the experienced user..other than newer videos from Vivo won't download, but that is a &quot;feature&quot; of Vivo jackasses not this application (consider it like copy-protection as found on DVDs and Blue Ray disks).

B006LSZECO|4.0|The story was compelling and interesting and I enjoyed reading the book until the ending. The author seemed to run out of story or imagination and the book ended with an abrupt 'thud'. Very disappointing. If it becomes a movie, it needs a better ending.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|(minor spoilers)<br />Amy goes missing on her fifth marriage anniversary, and as the police start investigating, suspicion begins to zero in on her husband, Nick. There are signs of a struggle in their house, overturned furniture that looks like it was overturned after the fact, broken glass, and later the police even find evidence of a sloppily cleaned-up blood stain in the house. Nick lies to the police, one lie after another, to cover up for the fact that his marriage with Amy had been on the rocks for some time. Things get worse when Nick's sister, Go (Margo), finds that he has also been having an affair with one of his students for over a year. Amy had, it seems, made one last attempt to resuscitate their marriage by leaving several clues in the form of letters, like she used to do, on the eve of their marriage anniversary. Nick figures these clues out, one after the other, but they bring him or the police no closer to cracking the case. Circumstantial evidence mounts and the rising evidence of a motive all point to Nick. Then there is the huge life insurance policy that would accrue to Nick in the event of Amy's death.<br /><br />Nick is a writer who had been laid off and had moved from New York to a North Carthage - a small town in Missouri by the Mississippi River. Amy had not been too happy with the move. She had been a New York girl, daughter to parents who were the picture-perfect ideal of a loving couple and doting parents, and also the authors of a successful series of books titled \\"Amazing Amy\\".<br /><br />The plot unfolds through two alternating first-person narratives - one is Nick's, and the other is Amy's, told through a diary she kept over the years. The diary tells of a doting husband who began to unravel as his career skidded off the rails. It tells of a loving wife increasingly scared of her husband.<br /><br />As all good thrillers go, there is a major twist in the tale in this one also. While the ending will leave most people wanting to tear their hair out in frustration, the rest of the book proceeds at a fast clip, the plot unravels as the reader goes through the pages, and later the loose ends are begun to be tied up in the latter half. The characters are sharply etched, though not really fully fleshed out, and in some ways behave in predictable and mostly one-dimensional ways. In a short caper of this kind, perhaps more depth is not needed. Most of the props and characters that make an appearance in the novel are put to use later in the plot - a sine qua non for a good thriller.<br /><br />A mostly enjoyable caper with a couple of twists in the tale make it a mostly satisfying read.their hair out in frustration, the rest of the book proceeds at a fast clip, the plot unravels as the reader goes through the pages, and later the loose ends are begun to be tied up in the latter half.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is my first Liane Moriarty although definitely not my last. She's captured complex feelings of love, betrayal, forgiveness and redemption and woven them into fine fabric.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book for the most part. It did not hook me like some other books like Blood Song or the Riyria Chronicles and I found myself going back and forth between this and other books in my library. As some other reviewers have already mentioned, the first half can drag a bit, but really picks up in the second half. I also felt that the story could have been condensed to about 700 pages or so instead of a 1000 pages. I am still on the fence on whether I will get the next book in the series, considering there is a lots of good books to choose from and I have a limited time for reading.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very spellbinding. A book that will keep you up at night until you finish it. The plot weaves in ways you cannot anticipate.
B00E0SX118|5.0|It was really good kids loved it!!!! Would recommend to watch. The kids like the different animals in it A+++++
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is one of those books where it kept coming back to haunt me as I have to say I saw it and ummed and aahed as the cover wasn't really appealing to me and I put it back down, then I read some reviews about it and then I saw the release of Fangirl and I was all like, ok - I am going to read Eleanor and Park. WOW - what an amazing book , I didn't realise what I had been missing out on. The tagline reads &#34;you never forget your first love&#34; which is true and though some of us are lucky to marry our first loves, others aren't but the fact of the matter is that they will always stay and lurk around. In Eleanor and Park we meet Eleanor first as she arrives to a new school , her red hair and fair skin makes her a target for bullying not to mention her masculine dress sense. The only seat on the school bus available is next to Park and soon the two of them become School Bus Buddies - Park starts to leave comics, batteries, walkman and music for her to listen to. It's not till we get to know the real Eleanor as we see why she is this way and I have to say I felt so sad for the character of Eleanor as she has nothing and then it's not like she could tell anyone as it would lead to her family being pulled apart or worse -hurt more than they are already. Over the course of the novel we read from both Eleanor and Park's POV's and watch their friendship grow closer and closer till they are boyfriend and girlfriend.<br />Eleanor and Park was really an amazing and powerful story of not only teen romance but of the friendships that one can make with a stranger that can haunt us for years to come.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|good movie. lots of talking, but very good. how many more words do I need to add here now? ?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky Davies has grown up a pretty much sheltered life and can't remember anything but snippets from her life before five years old when she was adopted by Karen. All her life, Karen has had strict rules and homeschooled Sky until Sky makes a request pushed on by her best friend Six aka Seven. For her senior year, she wishes to attend public school. Unfortunately for Sky, it will be anything but easy as due to Six's reputation and Sky being Six's best friend - she has earned herself the reputation of being a slut etc. With Six being in Italy on an exchange, Sky finds friends in Breckin - a Gay Mormon. Then from there on , she stops by the supermarket and meets Holder - a guy who seems to have about five different personality types and she's finds herself not only attracted to him but also he scares her as he is the most intense person she has ever met. As the story goes along, we read as the friendship between Breckin and Sky stays strong and then Sky's relationship with Holder continues. However , Holder is hiding a secret - one that will connect him to Sky's past pre-adoption period and one that will have Sky questioning everyone she knows and everything she has ever thought was the truth. How are Holder and Sky connected and will he still be standing by her when she realises that he is the one she needs the most ?<br />I have to say readers, if you love Edgy New Adult books which will have your emotions played with and ones that will draw you in and you can't put them down - then Colleen Hoover is the author for you.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I won't go into the history of the lps, that has been done already. All my lps in my box set were fine, typical some static low noise pops. I cleaned each lp with Spin Clean [[ASIN:B002UKSZUU SPIN-CLEAN - STARTER KIT RECORD WASHER SYSTEM Mk2]] this process may have helped somewhat. If people can't deal with some static, dust than stick to MP3s and cds. Otherwise these vinyls sound incredible, alot of homework was done on these digitally sourced vinyls. Silence straight through no skips, only Abbey Road had a skip, I repaired it, skip gone. Sorry for all the consumers that got bad boxes. Like I said I went to cds in the mid to late 1980s for that hit or miss problem with vinyl. Now that I'm back into vinyl I'm never leaving my cds, but I do enjoy some vinyl at times. I burned some of these beatles lps to cd, WOW!!! OH MY!!! the sound is scary awesome. Loud but sounds great at lower volumes.  After the burn to cds I appreciate vinyl in a new way. Rainbow dropped the ball out of the gate on this release, I hope through more recent pressings they solved alot of the manufactoring problems....The sound to me is no problem with this vinyl box. Mono vinyl will be nice and expensive  when the box is released supposedly later this year, but these stereo releases are incredible sounding. Amazing, things I never heard before.....
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Haven't seen this since it was in the theater, but boy does it hold up it fantastically in terms of capturing a time, place, and a life. The language, the essence ... you go through the decades and realize the way it was then seems so innocent compared to the gang/cartel life of today. The acting is superb, the camera-work is pure Scorsese, and the music ... oh, the music! ... gives the movie the energy of the time (shifting from late '50s to late '70s) and the feeling of feature-length music video.
B00845PT18|2.0|I did not like the movie; my grandson and husband did very much. I do like Nicolas Cage in other movies.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Nice apps with great sounds to help me sleep in a hotel or strange location. Has a great variety of sounds to chose from.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|A sniper shoots dead five innocent people by the river bank in Pittsburgh.  Police detain a suspect with a dubious past who all evidence points to.  All indications point to his guilt and it seems like an open and shut case to everybody except Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), retired Army police investigator.  What on the surface appears to be the work of a lone gunmen may be a conspiracy and it's up to Reacher to sort out the players.  This may be the best thriller since \\"The Usual Suspects\\" so it comes as no surprise that Christopher McQuarrie who wrote the script for that film directed and adapted Lee Child's novel.  The plot twists are plausible and leave you breathless.  I'm not very good with these detective films but my wife guessed pretty good the turns the movie was taking but even she was stumped at times.  Cruise seems more engaged than he has in years as the stoic Reacher.  He has created an iconic film character.  After the film is over you will be salivating for more films featuring Reacher.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|This app is so much fun that I have to fight to get my Kindle back so that I can play the game.

B00CA9Y6Q8|1.0|I can't quite get into her voice or the songs.  I like different artist outside of mainstream, but this is one artist I cannot get into.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Maybe I just don't like change, but the recent changes to the system don't seem to be  an improvement.  Since Yahoo mail is my major e-mail system having it less pleasant to use and less functional (in my view) is not a good thing.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I am amazed at the reviews.<br />They spend some money on this film, you really can't question the acting, but what happened to the writing?<br />Altogether this thing made very little sense, it's not sci-fi and for a horror film it is laughable.<br />Trust me - if you are over 5 years old you will not like this movie. Brains just went out the window on this one-, with the writers and the audience I guess.
B00138F8UU|5.0|I have been waiting for this album to finally become available! It's a staple album among my rock music collection. One of my favorites to listen to!!!
B00B32X786|5.0|This movie was awesome on a cold night curled up wanting a little adult time. I love the actors in it and the fact they portrayed real lives, things that actually happen to people. Life is not always a happy ending.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|It was a really good show.  Kept you on the edge of your seat. Would watch it again!!  Worth watching
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|Written in a way that makes it very easy to read. I would have enjoyed a bit more behind the science.
B0053O89KG|5.0|If you watch Castle you know what that means.....  We love this show and had to add this to complete our collection.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|I downloaded this to listen to Nightvale, and was ecstatic to find I could download it. Thanks Bambumba.<br />It works great on my Kindle Fire. Good job.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|If you are a Castle fan you have to purchase this set.... Get the entire series you will not be sorry.  Having the chance to watch the shows again allowed us to catch new things we had missed.
B002APU580|5.0|This book has been done many times and one of my all time favorite series was the one with Colin Firth - a fantastic version of Mr. Darcy. When P&P the 1995 series came out they said England (and especially London) had \\"Darcy Fever\\" because Colin Firth so captivated the masses with his smoldering performance.  That said, I really enjoyed watching this movie and even rewatched all my favorite parts, which, for me at least, is proof of an arresting piece of work.  The cast - notably - Keira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen, Brenda Blethyn, and Donald Sutherland are the type you can't keep your eyes off of when they are on screen.  The manners weren't quite as stiff as portrayed in the series - you could see the familial love and there was actually some awkwardness in Darcy which made the characters warmer and more accessible.  Well done.
B00CVDXAAG|5.0|We got this for a trip.  Kept us engaged the entire trip and made the trip fly by.<br /><br />Great book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great! I never really get tired of it, i could keep playing forever. It's a great way to pass time and adding facebook friends helps add some competative elements to it.

B009NQZVKG|5.0|great writer, great story, i love these characters . by now you must realize i am a great fan of action ,murder ,mysteries that keep you on the edge of your seat and craving for more sigma force .
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Too much medical information for me.  I was a bit disappointed. I've read many of these books and I could see where some might like it so I feel bad saying so.
B00CBLQCO4|5.0|always a big fan of his novels . this is no exception.the ending leaves things up in the air but as a fan you can interpret what you want to. about what is in store for the wistle blower.
1878424319|5.0|.. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to free themselves from the chains we carry in life that are all in our head..  I have read many self-help books well, I should say I have gotten halfway through a lot of self-help books.  Don Miguel has a way of speaking that is simply magic.  It's common sense but he speaks it in such a way that makes you think about it throughout the day. You really get it! I like to say is that it is life-changing indeed. I have given it to all of my friends and they have said the same thing. It truly speaks to the soul
B00D48BSBA|1.0|I have read all of Frederick Forsyth books. This is my least favorite. It was too predictable and there was no real plot.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A quietly funny and amusing book.  A little &#34;Forrest Gump&#34;ish, but worth the time to read it.  It's a little long-winded in places, but the story is wonderful.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is is a fun app that I play with my kids. We love it. Easy to use and fun playing the championships.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book was so great . I loved it and cannot wait for the city of ashes. The only bad thing about it was that they are siblings, it is kinda disturbing.
B00BB8T9FC|5.0|good story line , good acting,good casting,keeps your interest,makes you think,it is just a good drama,with a good ending,worth the watch.
B008KYWMYK|5.0|I bought these to wear on the pool deck and in the shower after water aerobics.  They work great and do not get slippery in the shower.  I also plan to travel to the tropics with these instead of flip-flops, since they provide toe protection and are safer for stairs and uneven surfaces. They are lightweight and don't take up much room in my pool bag or suitcase. I took them on one short (non-tropics) trip recently and they worked great as slippers and for short errands inside the hotel (to the ice machine, or to the lobby, for example). I tried sizing down but the smaller size were just too small. The size 7 works fine even though I often wear a 6-1/2 in regular shoes.
B00177YA1K|5.0|This humor is just too great and the effects so kool!<br />Delivery was excellent and paking excellent.<br />GREAT MOVIE<br />For all ages!

B0049IHX2C|5.0|Really excellent movie and excellent delivery...You will love the ending!  What a surprise and it brings all three movies together in ways you can't imagine.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app on a daily basis and I'm never dissapointed, the only thing I can complain about is that it freezes a lot.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This humor is just too great and seems to get better each additionally episode!<br />Delivery was excellent and paking excellent.<br />Loved the twist back to the original with the relationship between K and J...
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|A lovely film, full of strong characters and oddly beautiful locations. A classic coming-of-age story, particularly strong on the varying father/son dynamics between the men and boys. As all reviewers have noted, there are echoes of Mark Twain throughout, and &#34;Mud&#34; is worthy to keep company with Huck and Tom. High praise.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Great show every entertaining, love the motorcycles, actors are believe able and I can get enough of this show !

My parents who are not tech savvy are quick to pick up the simple operations of casting youtube videos.<br /><br />Singapore play store and Apple app store do not host the chromecast extension app. For Android phone, I used a VPN to access US play store to download the app. For iphone, you will need a US app store account.<br /><br />This region lock for chromecast app is disappointing.

B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is fun, comical, and our three year old loves it! He could watch this movie over and over and over. This is our second disk for him because he wore out the first one by handling it too much.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Even if you know nothing about \\"The Shining\\" this latest from Stephen King can totally stand on its own. It's been quite a while since I was captivated with a story to the  point where it invaded my dreams, and frankly it's refreshing to have gotten so lost in Doc's world that I frequently forgot the connection. Describing the mind of an alcoholic with the shine could only be done and truly turned by a non-practicing alcoholic (a dubious distinction I share) and Stephen has done it with steadiness, weariness and not just a little dignity.<br /><br />The characters are fierce and memorable, many we've met as  different folks in other books; they are genuine and believable.... even the True Crazy bitch. The story never plods but rather ebbs and flows and crashes and creates a weird kind of literary riptide before it pukes you out on the beach gasping for breath. Quite satisfactory.<br /><br />The only downside was it didn't last long enough, I love riding  that wave....
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great way to pass the time when you cannot move around, engaging the mind and a challenge great fun.  Has good color and graphics.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was awesome just like the rest of the series I loved this book read it.I rate it five out of five
B00E72OKAS|5.0|I wouldn't trade this game for any other . It has a lot of good graphics and a lot of zombies to kill which is cool . Not for young kids but hoops to play for adults . It is very addicting and entertaining for hours of play.
B000RP4LEO|5.0|As I am sure you can tell, I am stuck on Heléne Grimaud.  Her commentaries and her performances.  I would love to be in a studio with her to share in her work-experience, participate in microphone placement and mixing, and most of all talk personally.  Since this personal experience is beyond me, this and others of her CDs and DVDs are part of my library and I visit them often, especially after a long session at my own piano.

B00F91SCXC|1.0|Even Brad Pitt couldn't save this noisy, incoherent, no-story bomb. To criticize this thing's \\"script\\" gives the word script a very bad name. Hint: There is no script! If you want to melt through several years accumulation of ear wax just listen to this bombastic soundtrack. If you want to really experience morning sickness (men, take note) the several hundred jump-cuts per scene ought to do the trick. I  admit, one person's drek may be another's pablum but with all due respect, I  gladly pass the spoon.

B004B63M1S|1.0|I've never been a fan of Robert Rodriguez, and I am not sure his fanbase are aware of the amateurish nature of virtually everything he has made. In the nearly 20 years he has been making movies he's never graduated to being a serious filmmaker. His pal Tarantino is lights years ahead of him.<br /><br />This piece of crap movie was born out of the fake trailer between the movies of full &#34;Grindhouse&#34; experience a few years back. Remember that notorious bomb that nearly crippled Harvey Weinstein? Only the movie isn't really Grindhouse. The fake dirt and scratches laid over the opening scene disappear after the credits, and it looks like any old generic TV show for the most part with bland photography. If it kept up the dirt and scratches aesthetic, however fake, I would have respected it just a tiny little bit more.<br /><br />It's not a Grindhouse film, it doesn't have the balls to be. It's just a cheap, amateurish killing spree with lots of fake, CGI blood and boring characters. I assume Rodriguez has dirt or incriminating Polaroid's on absolutely every member of the cast as I can't think of any reason why anyone would willfully agree to be in this abortion. I wouldn't have this garbage listed on my filmography. I wouldn't even want it listed on my toilet paper.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like Danny Trejo and I LOVE Michelle Rodriguez, but this film was so bad that upon watching it a second time I actually found myself reading a factual book halfway through as it was rotting my brain that much.<br /><br />It's an angry 15-year-old's wet dream. It's one of the worst films I have seen in my life. I feel ashamed for watching it once. I feel like opening up my wrists for watching it twice. I don't want this Blu-ray in my house anymore.<br /><br />The movie is presented in 1.85:1 1080p which shows of the hackwork &#34;cinematography&#34; in all its blandness, with a loud, childish DTS HD-MA soundtrack. There are extras, but I'd rather swallow my own tongue than suffer any of them.han suffer any of them.
B00881VLCE|2.0|As a puzzle solution software package this s great.  Reliabilty is another question.  After you own this software for a while it gets flacky.  My experiance has been gstting worse as I use it.  Once I start a puzzle solution - don't leave the puzzle until it is done - or else you will get to start over. -  IF YOU ARE lucky!!!!!  Once you leave the puzzle undone the APP crashes on startup.  I have tried to reload the APP, MANY TIMES, but it does not help.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|I was actually very shocked to read about all of these near disasters with the \\"bomb\\".  I don't see any way for us to survive this age we live in unless we get rid of nuclear bombs and missiles for good and that will never happen. People make mistakes. It is human nature - and accidents occur even with the best of intentions. How can we survive \\"ourselves\\".

B00ECR7KX2|5.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />For anyone who has wondered, \\"What's the big deal about Shakespeare?\\", go and see this film, and you will understand.<br /><br />This story was written four hundred years ago, and yet in this production it has been slipped gently into the present day, and without other modification than extreme cleverness in the setting of scenes, the play still works.<br /><br />It works because the director and actors trust the words. The words give them the situation, the relationships between the characters, and each character's attitudes and objectives.<br /><br />I've never seen a production of Shakespeare, on either coast, or in London or Stratford, where the actors weren't winking and nudging the words, saying some of them louder, or, gods help us, slower, to make sure the audience understood the this bit is funny, or this bit is important. There's none of that in this production. And because of this, the simplicity and exactitude of each moment in each scene is clear, and strong. The play renders its power through its weight on each characters' hearts, and their love, pain, joy and desires conveys the story truly and lovingly.<br /><br />The pacing is exquisite. The extension of the first night's revelry into the drunken aftermath of the cold morning light, makes the Prince's offhand marriage proposal to Beatrice finally make sense. The brilliant choice that Borachio had a history with Hero makes his actions, and his later confession, work. It also puts the proper weight on the little scene that is usually cut, where Hero is deciding what to wear.<br /><br />I've never seen a better production of Shakespeare. What a joy that this one will run forever.

B00479SVBU|5.0|After installing a JVC KW-HDR81BT CD receiver in my wife’s Dodge Magnum, and a JVC Arsenal KD-AHD75BT in my Dodge Ram, it became blatantly clear that my 2005 Jaguar Super V8’s entertainment center wasn’t in the same league with today’s sound systems. Mine you, the Jag’s sound system was ‘state-of-the-art’ in 2005, the golden age of the CD.<br /><br />The 2005 Super V8 was built as a limo, with the Queen in mind. The back seat incorporates a plethora of sources to choose what is being piped throughout the cabin. Strangely enough, the driver doesn’t have as many options, but has ultimate control over the use of the entertainment system.<br /><br />In my quest to bring the 2005 Jag’s entertainment system on par with the Magnum and Ram, I wanted to enhance, but not compromise an already excellent sound system. In order to do this, the addition of Bluetooth, for hands free calling and streaming; along with the ability to play MP3 files was prominent on my short-list. I wanted a solution that would require minimum effort, but return the greatest ‘bang for the buck’.<br /><br />After an extensive period of research and testing I settled on two units that proved more than adequate:<br /><br />The Jabra Freeway<br />[...]<br /><br />and . . .<br /><br />The Satechi Soundfly AUX<br />[...]<br /><br />Both units were inexpensive and exceeded my expectations. My goal was achieved without compromising, or turning a screw on the Jag. I am totally pleased with this ‘plug n play’ solution, and would recommend these products without reservation.<br /><br />** This post was written without harming a Jag . . .

B00E0G5U4G|5.0|17 years after releasing their 1996 effort \\"Swansong\\", legendary British death metal masters Carcass have finally returned in an absolute big time way with their phenomenal comeback release \\"Surgical Steel\\", and one thing that I have to say is that it has definitely reached all of my listening expectations ever since I first bought it. This album is without a shadow of a doubt the best death metal album of 2013, but also the absolute best metal album of 2013 hands down in my opinion as well. It is just absolutely phenomenal and downright epic in every single aspect, I just freaking love this album, in fact I've had this album spinning in rotation in my CD stereo player ever since first buying it back in September and I've been cranking it up and listening to it almost every day. Now the album itself as I've said before is just flat out phenomenal, it is 100% full proof that Carcass (who have since reformed back in 2007) have definitely not lost their edge one bit at all whatsoever. Every classic Carcass trait and element is all present on \\"Surgical Steel\\": Massive, grinding, scorching, head crushing riffs, soaring and majestic NWOBHM melodies and epic face melting guitar solos, intense skull pounding drum work, throat scraping growls and snarls, disturbing song titles and lyrics, believe me it's all on here. And of course not to mention that the production on this album is very slick and top notch throughout thanks to main producer Colin Richardson and with help from Andy Sneap handling the mixing and mastering as well. Jeff Walker's trademark raspy, throat scraping growls and snarls are more vicious than ever before and they just really make you wanna rip someone's face off. He sure has never sounded so better as far as I'm concerned, and he also provides some strong bass work throughout as well. Bill Steer's guitar work on here is just absolutely eargasmic and shows that he is truly at the top of his game with his massive, scorching, in your face riffs and blazing, face melting and also at times melodic leads and solos and soaring melodies. Meanwhile new drummer Dan Wilding proves to be an excellent choice for the job as he pounds and blasts his way throughout with perfect timing and precision throughout. Plenty of hammering death/grind blast beats, blazing thrash metal style tempos, and double bass kicking throughout on this beast here.<br /><br />The songs:<br /><br />Now as far as the songs on this epic beast go, they're all highlights for sure. There's definitely not one single bad song on here whatsoever. It all kicks off with the melodic guitar intro \\"1985\\" which sets the tone for and leads straight into the near 2-minute headbanger \\"Thrasher's Abattoir\\" which is an absolute straight up onslaught of slashing, trail blazing death/thrashing power and madness that will just rip your face right off, while the following track \\"Cadaver Pouch Conveyor System\\" is another thrashing beastie that boasts ridiculously catchy guitar leads, hammering drums, slashing riffs and melodic soloing. Next up, we've got \\"A Congealed Clot of Blood\\" which slows the pace down a bit with slow punishing grooves, rolling double bass fills, crunchy power chords, as well as a great melodic solo. The following track \\"The Master Butcher's Apron\\" is another highlight which features an opening onslaught of slaughtering blast beats before shifting into a monster pounding groove with massive, pounding riffs until the blazing speed and thrashing intensity picks up afterwards. Then up next, we have \\"Noncompliance to ASTM F899-12 Standard\\" which is my favorite track on here that is highlighted by an awesome melodic guitar lead opening followed by fiery tremolo riffing backed by pummeling blast beats, as well as more thrash style percussioning and a pair of memorable guitar solos to boot. Another highlight, track seven \\"The Granulating Dark Satanic Mills\\" features a catchy and powerful chorus along with catchy melodic guitar riffing, meanwhile \\"Unfit For HumanConsumption\\" keeps the supreme viciousness coming with more vicious, raging power chords, bloodthirsty vocals, and a blazing solo backed up by a pummeling thrash tempo. Following that is track nine \\"316L Grade Surgical Steel\\" which has become my 2nd favorite track on here that features more fantastic riffing throughout, some melodic and some aggressive, as well as an outstanding melodic guitar solo (probably my favorite guitar solo on the album), more blistering thrash tempos, and some very catchy growl a long lyrics at the end. Track ten \\"Captive Bolt Pistol\\" (which I'm very sure everyone has heard by now) is another slashing, blazing death/thrash fest that boasts fire blazing riffs, shredding solos, blasting drums, and seething vocals that just slash everything in it's path, and then we finally reach the album's epic 8+ minute prog-ish sounding finale \\"Mount of Execution\\" which ends this beast of an album on a very strong and powerful note from it's acoustic guitar intro that gives way to a mammoth yet steady mid paced metal beatdown to it's steady yet pounding outro that will have your head bobbing in unison.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Surgical Steel\\" is an all around immense and epic tour de force from these British death metal legends, and it proves that 17 years after the last album, Carcass are once again firing on all cylinders and have not lost their touch whatsoever. To put it straight and simple, this album kicks ass, and it also has my pick for metal album of the year as far as I'm concerned. Anyways if you're a longtime fan of Carcass, then by all means \\"Surgical Steel\\" will not disappoint you whatsoever. To all the new bands out there, if I were in your shoes, you'd better start taking notes, cuz the surgeons are back in business...Strongly Recommend!!!<br /><br />\m/Consumption\\" keeps the supreme viciousness coming with more vicious, raging power chords, bloodthirsty vocals, and a blazing solo backed up by a pummeling thrash tempo.

B00E3IZIM0|3.0|I saw this with my gay Filipino friend who sat there disappointed the whole time. I have no idea what he was expecting, but this movie was loud, busy looking and a bit over the top. Much like my gay Filipino friend.<br /><br />The theatre was just the right temperature but the chairs lacked style. Amazing popcorn though. I would see it again just for the popcorn. Otherwise I'd wait for it to come on the Oxygen network.

B004BLDD9Y|4.0|Loved the warm white color, loved the low energy consumption, loved the form.  Disappointed in packaging: two of my four purchased bulbs had shattered glass globes.  It appears EVER Lighting has been trying to mitigate this problem, as my bulbs all had a pre-wrap of small bubble wrap, then the plastic clamshell, then the cardboard box.  With it's heavier ceramic base, this bulb loves to break itself in shipping, as any shipping jolt of the base towards the globe, will likely break the glass, even with the extra bubble wrap.<br />After putting on protective glasses and gloves, it was fairly easy to scrape out the remaining broken glass and sealant from the base rim with a small flat screwdriver.  Now they might even run cooler (longer).<br />For EVER Lighting factory: suggest change packaging: molded fiber or plastic box insert that the bulb screws into, so that shock loads are borne by the base, not the fragile glass globe.  Or use a thin polycarbonate globe, not a glass one.

B0054S6N04|5.0|I'm a huge Linda Howard fan and already owned Mr. Perfect in paperback, but decided to buy the ebook, too. I noticed several instances of typos that aren't in the paperback version. Apparently, demon autocorrect gets in the way of Kindle, too.<br /><br />Mr. Perfect is a great blend of humor, suspense and romance. The characters are fun, smart and interesting. Jaine is probably my favorite romantic heroine. She's an unrepentant smart ass and you wish she was in your circle of friends on girls night. I've often wished that Ms. Howard would do a follow up on Sam and Jaine's story - you know it would be a wild ride!

0345803450|3.0|I vowed never to look at McEwan's work again after reading his abysmal novel \\"Solar\\".<br /><br />However, I decided to give him a second chance and tried this which was certainly much better than \\"Solar\\" but that's hardly high praise.<br /><br />The book gives a young woman's account of how she was recruited by the British intelligence service in the 1970s and ended up involved with a writer she was spying on.<br /><br />It is based on the secret financing of literary magazines like \\"Encounter\\" by the CIA to offset the success of Communism among the chattering classes in the post-war era.<br /><br />However, it is not a classic John Le Carr&eacute;-type spy story despite the usual characters.<br /><br />Instead, the narrator recounts her love affairs and moral dilemmas and there are lots of references to what was happening at that time to give it an authentic touch.<br /><br />I got quickly bored with the slow, soggy pace and thought the best parts were the plots of the writer's stories rather than the plot of \\"Sweet Tooth\\" itself.

B005NACYQU|4.0|decade of his Sandman comic, I came to American Gods with a good deal of expectation and left it feeling rather disappointed because it's nothing new. If you've read the 'Brief Lives' story in Sandman, then you've very much read American Gods, or at least got many of the ideas from it.<br />The plot is essentially a road trip wherein the protagonist travels to 'places of power' around America (i.e. places that have significant mystical or emotional resonance) and meets the gods whom successive waves of immigrants (Egyptian, Norse, Russian, Eastern European, Mexican, etc...) have brought with them to the United States, all of them now lacking power or focus as belief in them has drifted away.<br />The story itself is of the conflict between old & new gods (the internet, the media, and so on) but that's irrelevant. More important to the story are ideas and settings, and Gaiman has used all these ideas and setting before - which is what results in the book being a disappointment. He has tremendous skill with dialogue, and captures the American Idiom wonderfully, but the repetition of ideas from earlier work (with nothing new added), and also the fact that the protagonist meets gods everywhere (indeed, one sometimes suspects that America has no population other than dispossessed deities, so few normal people does he meet), leads me to deduct one star from five.<br />If you aren't familiar with Gaiman's work, you're in for something of a treat. If you are familiar with his work, then, plotwise, you won't find anything here that you haven't read before. However, his writing is strong and characterisation consistent enough for the feelings of mild d&eacute;j&agrave; vu upon reading this book to be at worst a nagging feeling, and never does it distract too badly from an enjoyable read.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is great all fans of the Percy Jackson  series! The book is the first book in a series that continues the Percy Jackson  series! :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wasn't as horrifying as The Shining, but a fantastic read.  I loved the book.  Had great plot points and was really cool to learn more about how Danny turned out.
0810997827|5.0|my 11 year read them all on a one week visit to Florida.  She loved them.  I saved them to pass down to my 7 year old son.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I received this as a FAOTD, however, I'm now very likely to pick up another one of the developer's hidden object games after playing this.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />First and foremost ... no permissions! Also, a relatively small install footprint (about 45MB). Multiple ways to play the same scene such as pictures of the objects, silhouettes, text, scrambled text, \\"hangman\\" (think \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" as the object's name is slowly revealed), conveyor belts (i.e. limited time to find the current object), and more (including combinations of the aforementioned). High scores and unlockable scenes.<br /><br />What some people might have an issue with:<br />There is no story here, but I wasn't looking for one. Just a great hidden object game. There are a limited number of objects per scene and you can quickly learn their positions, which helps you obtain those high scores; however, unless you're a savant, you're not going to remember the placements for very long ... meaning you should be able to experience it anew after about a month of inactivity. I'd argue all hidden object games suffer from this. This really needs to be played on a tablet, and the larger the screen the better. Zoom is limited to a single level of magnification and its activated via a magnifying glass in the upper right corner as opposed to pinching. Not a big deal, just takes a moment to get used to.<br /><br />So, overall a very good hidden objects game that has lots of different modes with a nice theme to tie it all together. I'd rate it four stars and gave it an additional star for having no permissions.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just love it.  It's like taking care of a real horse.  Very realistic looking horses.  It's a lot of fun!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The first three books of this series are amazing. Quite possibly the best fantasy books I have ever read. Martin does a great job of taking situations and turning them in directions you'd never expect an author to go. This is an extremely compelling read, essentially a medieval soap opera with world spanning consequences as well as stories of personal triumphs and tragedies. Join a huge cast of characters as they journey through this roller coaster of highs and lows. During the trip you learn to loath and love them (sometimes even the same character). Most of Martin's characters are rendered in such a way so that they feel human and not just one dimensional caricatures.<br /><br />If there is a downside to this series it is that by book four we begin to wander away from the main characters we come to care about as new ones gets introduced. I can understand the author's desire to milk this gravy train, but the reality is that he should finish this story and then start another in the same universe. Trust me, people will tune in.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I find the game of throne books a great story written with twice the words necessary. I believe the author truly enmeshes you in the story but find that some of the description is more than I would be able to follow. I am caught up in the story and will continue reading but where the Hobbit was a &#34;can't put down&#34;, Silmarillion had so much detail I couldn't keep the story moving. This is better than that but be prepared for a long albeit interesting read!
B00A7CI82I|2.0|This is one of those movies that makes you feel like someone owes you 2 hours of your life back.  It takes about 45 minutes into the movie to understand what the hell is going on, and after it finally seems like it is going somewhere, it gives you a disappointing ending.  I like Jeremy Renner and Edward Norton, but this is just being greedy and trying to extract as much as possible from the franchise.
B00DRGQZRG|5.0|Who knew that fusion was in the past of DH?  I surely didn't - but, in this CD he re-sets the fusion bar (without any lose of jazzy  development) in a way (both harmonic and instrumentally) that was never done previously byt his fusionisnta fore bearers (here I mean Weather Report, Chick Corea, or even the Bitches Brewer, himself - which did include, unbeknownst to me, Mr DH).  DH, and ensemble (who knew Kevin Eubanks could get down like that? - certainly not I, from his stints on late night TV) go where no fusion band has gone before - and reach new heights, sounds, intensity -while coasting along neatly on a melange of textured rhythmic and harmonic adventures;  while emanating and transcending from the pentatonic regions of Guitar-shrederosity, this CD goes way beyond, in melody, texture and harmonic explorations, than any other prior (fusion) ensemble, so keyed by six string slinger-ism.  Moments of transcendence and musical apotheosis evolve through complex rhythmic interactions and the tunes develop and expand both within and from a strong driving rhythmic component (but hey, I've never been disappointed by Eric Harland's drumming, ever, whether with the Oakland Symphony or local jazz chantreuse - and he continues to power this ensemble thoroughly, with elegance...for my taste, yeah, you better beware, Mr Baker - EH has it all here).  And so do his compatriots in sound - there are several adventurous forays on the keyboard that remain within and support so well the whole context of the effort - truely a remarkable ensemble excursion.  I would have love to be in the room when this was going down.  surprisingly DH seems to take a back seat, but his drive and power both motor and anchor the whole darn effort - kudos to him for this adventurous musical path, bringing together these monster players.  For me, album of the year, if not yet, then eventually...for all you jazz guitarists ( and also for all you rock/roll jam banders) this is the CD to check out - the bar has now been thoroughly raised - and the bounderies completely sundered between Beckism and Bensonism -  where tone, technique and musicality coincide, without trampling over each other, in this delightful, ear opening expedition to and  through the frontiers of sonic space - without ever loosing sight of groove, power, harmonic potential and implication.  Perhaps this may be a reach for those of the cool jazz disposition, but put it on for a spin, sit back and let it work/rock you a bit.  I  think you will be surprised by where it goes, and how you end up....r has now been thoroughly raised - and the bounderies completely sundered between Beckism and Bensonism -  where tone, technique and musicality coincide, without trampling over each other, in this delightful, ear opening expedition to and  through the frontiers of sonic space - without ever loosing sight of groove, power, harmonic potential and implication.

B008N1LL42|2.0|I'm not one to keep tabs on how many loose ends a movie does not tie, but this movie is just ridiculous.  The human race is supposedly fighting a race of advanced aliens, but they must have sent the reject team of aliens to do the job.  They eliminate a whole armada of ships, but are kind enough to leave one ship unharmed, just because it does not seem to be a threat.  The movie is filled with inconsistencies like this, along with bad acting.  I was amazed to see how many good reviews this movie has on Amazon.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Saw the movie and liked it but then read this book and now wish I had not seen the movie first.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Best Birthday gift for my daughter, who is a Castle fan. She now has all 5 series Dvds. Thanks Amazon.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Good book in the series. I would recommend this as a good read.  You will need to read the other books though.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I think it was awesome, and you actually get to use the pigs! I like using count duku and droidrika. I love this game!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I keep this app on all my devices, for me and if my grand kids are here or I need to entertain a child while in doctors office etc.<br />This game can keep any child entertained from 4 - 104.
096798467X|5.0|Instuctions were excellent, lots of reference and the results were amazing.  If you are seeking for a summer project, this is one that you want to build!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I won't give lengthy details about this movie. I feel like if you've made it this far, you know what it's about. But I will say this, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was incredible!!! His best performance ever. A much more believable (and terrifying) rendition of the madman than the more cartoon-y versions from previous Batman flicks.
B007STBUIW|5.0|We got this for my daughters sleepover shark party and we all loved it! The girls said they wouldn't be scared by an old movie but they were wrong.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I love this movie so much. The way they speak, the characters, the plot, everything. If you haven't done so already, you need to watch it! Especially if you're a JGL fan.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two steps up the story line with drama, drama, drama. Great book, once you start you won't be able to stop!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works great no problems easy to read easy to use.. quick and fast download that had no issueswould definitely recommend
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was so reluctant to read this series, and yet I was pulled in more and more with each chapter. By the end of the 3rd book, I was so sad to see it end. I feel a little like a bad break up right now...I want more!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this game. I think it's cool and unique. It's very simple to play  and the game never ends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was initially hesitant to read the series  because of the explicit sex scenes. Once I started it, I realized those were minor compared to the deep story line. Great series!
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|horrible video quality i was refreshing and backing out every two minutes couldn't enjoy the movie due to this poor video quality.
B008PZZYB2|2.0|Not my style of humor. I just don't find this style of sophomoric dumb humor. The setting for the idea is just not laugh worthy in my opinion.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|the picture quality could have been better i'm tired of backing out and refreshing it takes away from enjoying the movie. love the movie hate the fact that i couldn't really watch it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great sized buttons, functions are color coded perfectly, blows away other calculators because of its useability, IMHO.  Highly reommended for everyday use.
B005P78TUG|5.0|Great live action movie of an awesome childhood cartoon. Delivered timely and I am extremely satisfied with the purchase. If u like Japanese anime of the 70s n 80s this is a must see.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|This is a very fun and addictive game,however the fact that you can only have to fingers being used at once on a kindle fire gets me killed every time.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a awesome app.  I have a rooted D2 tablet and it has made thevpad more enjoyable than when i first got it.  I love the uninstall pre-loaded app feature. Great job tech team!  AAAAAAAAAAAAA++++++++++
1465414444|5.0|If you love the game, this book is a really nice thing to add to your collection.  It's nicely done.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app sucks on kindle it works perfectly on my iPod but here it doesn't work.it needs to be fixed.
B0040I09RM|3.0|I really loved the series until after the writers strike.  When they started showing the show after the strike I just didn't ever start following it again.  Sons of Anarchy isn't the only TV series that I did care for after the writers strike.  The writer's, of course, make all the show whether it be good or bad, but their strike did more harm than good to their material.
B00F2362IE|5.0|i like this game because my grandson plays it a lot it teach him how to play different kind of level and to win trophies
B00E3I3KDE|1.0|I have to agree with many of the other comments here....I purchased the \\"old\\" Halcyon Deluxe CD a few days after it came out. Now they release the same album with a second CD full of new songs for even more money.  Though I like the songs....I refuse to repurchase this CD to get the EP tacked on to the original CD I've already purchased. The record company should release this as both a deluxe and separate CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a really cool game and addicting but me and my family and friends keep talkin about it and keep asking \\"why don't they put subway surfers San Antonio\\" y'all should do that y'all should make the board like the San Antonio spurs basketball team...............and make the character like the San Antonio Spurs mascot the coyote.........and the background when u start running should have the tower of America because we have that and should have the Alamo in it maybe............that would be cool.<br />Thank you for consideration............and I hope you get this message.<br /><br />  Sincerely, Roger.A.Martinez Jr.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is such a great product when it works. Streams well, is easy to install, and the UI is great.<br /><br />Problem is, it really does not work at all, It's buggy, it stalls SO often as to make it useless. Many Xs I've had to simply UNPLUG it in order to get control of the stream: The control from the laptop will simply stop working and if you want to stop the stream it's necessary to pull the dongle out of of the TV.<br /><br />Come on, that is crazy. This is a half-baked, non-tested dongle that simply does not work consistently.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it just as easy to use as the site on the desk top. I spend way to many hours looking through all the posts.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love that there are silly cartoons AND the game, made it seem a little more worth my money. My 5 year old had been begging me for this game!
B00594XOZU|3.0|Get file manger from the kindle store. It's free.  Go to 1mobile.com and find kik  Download it and open it on file manger  I'm serious. I was surprised it worked so well. I have dolphin browser too now :D   Edit: they fixed the problem that was there before. However this isn't the recent update so you can't join hashtag groups. They need to update it.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I've shared it in a group setting and have been able to recharge several phones.  It is simple to work and easy to carry.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I used this Dongle in India & yes it works. It is amazing. The reason i gave 4 stars is coz it doesn't allow us to cast the local contents on Tab or Laptop...
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I love reading the Bible anytime, anywhere.  However it was stated that once I downloaded it into my Kindle I would not have to have the internet on. I found out that I do and I don't like it.  All other books I purchased through Kindle I can read them anytime.  Why can't I do that with the Bible.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|If you like your heroes (this movie has many), like adventure and an interesting story line, this movie is just the ticket.  Really enjoyed the different hero characters with their distinct personalities and their interactions within the plot.  Each contributes in their own way to make this a very watchable movie and well worth the time investment (2 hours and 20 minutes or so).  Robert Downey Jr. shines as Iron Man.  Plot kept your attention and wondering what was going to happen next.  Great escapism.  Highly recommended.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Wow! I'm really impressed by this album I felt compelled to write a review immediately after listening to it. Thoroughly enjoyed this album and deserves a 5 stars in my book. I simply can't get enough of this!
B00B1RB942|2.0|First, let me say that this is a very nice looking movie visually, the OZ sequences were very impressive, though I have to mention 90% of the movie takes place in the real world in a Japanese household and not in OZ. I'm not trying to be insulting, but this movie tries way to hard to be \\"heartwarming\\", and in so doing comes off incredibly cheesy and corny to me, as some other reviewers have mentioned as well. The idea of a family going into a virtual world to save the planet just seems kind of dumb to me, and I think it was the part when the old man whipped out his DS and came to Kazuma's rescue (and yeah, you're supposed to take that seriously- it's not a comedy) that I just laughed and kind of gave up on the movie. I think it's trying to be kind of a Studio Ghibli type film, but I've never seen a Studio Ghibli movie that stoops to the level of melodrama that Summer Wars does. If you have a high tolerance for sappy saccharine you'll probably like it, but it wasn't for me.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I love the movie n my little ones do too. Iolny wish it didn't get scratched now it skips n freezes.
B005544V6A|5.0|Fast paced and fun show that is great to watch. The scripts and acting are top notch. Really glad it is on Amazon Prime Video.
B003MZ0I84|2.0|Hands All Over was an ok CD. Maroon 5 has lost their appeal to me. This CD has some good songs but isn't \\"classic\\" Maroon 5. So if that's what you're looking for, this isn't it. The CD did, however, arrive in perfect condition and on time. So A+ to the seller!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The minecraft pocket edition game has a lot of different worlds and items. I just wish they would get updates in faster and add things like caves and bigger worlds. Other than that this game is a great app and well worth the $7.
B007V508CC|1.0|Very disappointed in this album. Maroon 5 has sold out and become too mainstream. Their first 3 albums were great but this one sucks. Wasted my money. Have only listened to it once and was disgusted. The only positive was the seller. CD arrived in great condition  by the promised time so the seller was great!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book was a compelling read-heartfelt at times without being full of blame.<br />There are some valuable life lessons in the book-mostly how the choices we make when we are young have the ability to change our lives for forever.<br />There were moments that had me laughing out loud and some that had me in tears<br />A raw portrait of the U.S penal system for sure!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Very moving book.  The characters were believable.  Parts of it were very sad.  Would like to read more like it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman has the gift of taking the reader into his reality like very few writers. From the first sentence to the last I lived in the world of his creation. Thank you!
1609611543|3.0|Information that gives a person a lot to think about the eating habits<br />that have come forward in the past decade.  Gives you a reason to<br />think a little before you eat.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I love this classic movie! We recently shared it with our children and they loved it as well! Great Adventure for kids of all ages!
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|It is a great movie, was when it first came out and watched it with my daughters and I enjoy watching even more now with my grandchildren, not to long, nice music and easy to follow.
B0026SFEW8|5.0|If you haven't seen Grease - it's a must.  Classic musical.  Just great fun. The latter days of high school this drama is fairly timeless (except for the car races).
B00C81AVNU|4.0|This cast will be historical.  I wanted a permanent record for myself.  I will have to wait for a road show to see the live performance.  But, this CD lets me enjoy what people in New York are seeing now.
B004I9CXHW|1.0|not at all what it looks like....it appears that you could plug your usb cable into and use it as an extension  but that is not the case at all
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is a fantastic book with a lot of twists and turns.  Didn't love the ending totally, BUT the movie is being filmed in Cape Girardeau, MO, a local town.  All very exciting and can't wait to compare the book to the movie!!!
B000YAYIXQ|5.0|This collection of songs really establishes Amy Winehouse as a bonafide blues diva. I believe that history will portray her as a truly gifted albeit tragic blues star in the manner of Billie Holiday.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just read it and discover the beautiful magic of young love and phenomenal writing, you won't be disappointed in the slightest.
B000V63AVY|4.0|While I was never a major Supertramp fan, this collection made me realize what a truly talented group they were. I've gained a new appreciation for them.
B004742Y40|5.0|Classic wholesome family movie.  I always enjoy watching 80s movies. Michael J. Fox does an excellent job.  Very good movie.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|this is an amazing game. I downloaded it for my grandson, but I find myself playing it more than he does. it is educational, a challenge to keep up, and expensive!  7 pearls for a treasure chest &amp; u get less than 800 algae. the new fish need 20,000 algae every 48 hours. impossible to keep up with. it has been so long since last expansion that I have nowhere to plant new plants so I cannot complete most homework!  but this game is amazingly fun to play. send an expansion!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love it it is so good I encourage everyone to read this it is amazing to study I love it
B009RX7WTI|5.0|My favorite TV shows just keeps coming. The writing is perfect, the acting amazing, and to have everything to see again and again is worth it.
B000WQW988|5.0|After having seen it on TV many times, I still liked it so much that I wanted to own it.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|I awoke in the middle of the night from a dream, with Laura Mvula's song That's Alright resounding in my mind as the vision's musical score.  As my dreams are often MOS, (Mit Out Sound), this was literally eye opening!<br />My bride heard about Mvula on NPR, and we sat down one night recently and listened to her album, Sing to the Moon.  It is remarkable, and wonderful.<br />The lyrics are piquant, and ebullient, sometimes pungent.<br />The arrangements harken to the best of blues and jazz, with the threat of dissonance lurking in the next measure.  Most often, the melody and harmonies only touch down lightly on a chord that, while it refuses to resolve, it pulls you forward into a new line of invention.  Expect hairpin key changes, tempo downshifts an accelerations, and turbocharged anthemic brass, chorus, and string break-outs that might make you get up and dance.<br />Mvula's work has the sweet freshness that Joan Armatrading's did when she first gained recognition; and Tracy Chapman, too.  Yet Sing to the Moon is not an album of laments and dirges for mistakes and calamity.  It is a mellow, sometimes fierce paean to the vitality of and power of a life fully lived through every moment.<br />I regret that the Amazon sample of That's Alright begins in medias res, missing out on a crackling percussion intro that boils with the heat of Simon and Garfunkel's Cecilia.  Start with the Youtube version here, try not to think of Grace Jones, and enjoy.<br />The way I see it, Laura Mvula breaks down the wall of sound with a sledgehammer, a Wrecking Crew unto herself, and then invites you to rebuild it with her.  So?  On your feet!<br /><br />[...]
0345803493|4.0|The quality of the first book remains, but it has little surprises in the second book. I guess I might be unfair as the first one was unexpected - I bought it in spite of the hype, not because of it.

B00EXVZW6E|5.0|When I got this app, there were 12 reviews.  All of them were 5-star glowing reviews.<br /><br />For good reason.  By the time I had posted, there was one more, and my review will continue that trend.  It may not seem like it, but to get 14 out of 14 reviewers giving 5-stars on an app is very rare.  There are dozens, if not hundreds, of these types of games on Amazon and elsewhere; I personally have at least 20, and probably double that.  NONE of them have ever come CLOSE to the offering of Hidden Objects Quest 6!<br /><br />Great stereo atmospheric music, and great graphics on 10\\" tablet; you can tell the care the developer took to create each scene.  You won't be irritated or disappointed by the music or sound effects, and if you are then simply reduce the volume in the settings.  There is also a Zoom button in the upper right corner.<br /><br />The game has two modes: Kid's Mode and Adventure Mode.  The Kid's Mode is made for kids, and I have no doubt that my 5-year-old daughter will be able to play, and enjoy, this game.<br />In Kid's Mode, the objective is to find the objects as quickly as possible.  The object to find is located on a platform/table at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />Adventure mode is quite challenging; the developer took great effort to create each of the 24 scenes.  Each of the scenes has three Quests, and a bonus quest to unlock through perfect scores.  Each of the Quests has three different quest types to choose from, but there are more than a dozen different quest types for the game to offer!  Similar to other games of this type, you unlock each scene by competing the scene before it.  The difficulty gets harder as you complete more scenes.<br /><br />All of the quests are timed, and while some of the modes have no penalties, others have great penalties for using the hints system.  Word of advice: try not to use the Hint system.<br /><br />Many of the different types of Quests:<br /> + Classic Object Quest<br /> + Classic Conveyor<br /> + Silhouette Search<br /> + Silhouette Conveyor<br /> + Words - Find named object (English only, just like the rest of the Quests involving words)<br /> + Object Words Conveyor<br /> + Scramble<br /> + Search in the Fog<br /> + Hangman<br /> + Hidden Bomb Time Search<br /> + Searchlight<br /> + Find the Differences<br /> + Mirror-Mirror Search<br /><br />To extend the replayability of this game, the developer added in a couple dozen different achievements.

B00E38KGF4|4.0|It is free.  I have never had this antivirus before ,but I guess I will find out how good it is.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Pretty gruesome, but these guys need support for such an amazingly well done job on their budget. I'm so impressed with all that they did, that this is just an amazing breath of fresh air in move making these days.<br /><br />Massive kudos to these guys. I'm sad to hear they fell very short under their mark.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you like the show, or if you like fantasy science fiction, this is a great book series. It transports you into another world where the supernatural are real, the royals are social climbers, and every word has meaning. If you watch the show, and enjoy the intrigue, the books are the way to go. You will be glad you did.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I really like this game.  It's matching objects and going through phases.  There are two types of games and each one has eight levels.  It's fun and easy.  I recommend it for all ages/.

1878424319|5.0|I have given this book to a lot of guys.  It is about core values and behavior.  I read it a couple of times a year.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is a simple, yet fun game.  Whenever work gets boring this is the game to play.  The guns are great, and the level up system is addictive.  If you have OCD or just have to get every upgrade possible, the leveling up system is built for just that.  I have only hunted animals twice in my lifetime, but I have done a lot of Haji hunting, and I love how this game slows down after the shot is fired.  That's what it always felt like for me, when I squeezed the trigger
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|this young lady has a great feel for the blues! plays a great guitar and sings the blues like she was born to do it. I highly recommend this cd.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Pay close attention... this is a great movie... certainly one to spin your mind in several different directions... a must see... a must buy...

B00B9366VO|2.0|I liked learning a little about the recording studio industry and the music business and the artists themselves.  I was annoyed by the alternation of dialogue so quiet I couldn't hear it with music so loud I had to turn it down.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|I love himym! you will too! season 8 is greatttttttttt definlyy buy it! himym is a great tv show!!!! !!
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Did not enjoy the story line.  Story did not draw me in struggled to finish it.  Story went no were.
B009EE1GC4|3.0|Our reception of it on a Smart TV was so poor we gave up watching it a quarter of the way into it.  We want to watch it and will try again some day.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such a beautiful and tragic story. Could not put it down. Beautifully written and poetic in nature. A truly gifted writer.
B00ELU7A4E|3.0|For those who are whining about getting duped into thinking this was something else, please do us all a favor and read the product description.  It clearly states &#34;import&#34; and &#34;single.&#34;  This makes it an imported single.  An import single, like any other single, will be a single song with one or more b-sides, and because it is an import, typically from England or France, it will be more expensive.  Please stop blaming Amazon or Katy Perry because you didn't bother to read what you ordered.  That aside, I will agree that it is a bit expensive as imports go, and in the end I think the U.S. single version is good enough, and cheaper.  Probably an item only for the core fans.
0141345659|4.0|This is a good book. Not an excellent book. I feel like a lot of people just like it because John Green wrote it. But if you're in the John Green haze and loving it, then don't let me take you out of it; that's just what it felt like to me. I still recommend it, but I would just put it on hold at the library or ask a friend to borrow it. Not actually go out and buy it.
B00E9P959O|4.0|I have been a Rush fan since 1980, and you can read some of my reviews here on Amazon over the past two decades.<br />One of the other reviewers hit it on the head when he/she said it was better in some places and worse in others. My feeling after comparing the two is that the first 6 songs are better because of the remixing, and the remaining ones are just a tad worse. It seems like the mixer's efforts kind of faded after the first 'album side' (remember those?).<br /> PRO: The raw emotion is gone.<br /> CON: Geddy's layers of harmonies are much more clear.<br />Example of Better = Peaceable Kingdom. So much is clear and better, yet maintaining the raw emotion of the original cut.<br />Example of Worse = Out of the Cradle. All of the energy seems to have been sapped out of this cut. Still good, but not of Rush quality.<br />Regardless - I consider it a blessing that we now have two versions of Vapor Trails; depending on your mood, each and every song is the best.<br />Thank you Rush for this effort. It's like having a entirely new Rush album to debate, here on this ongoing music of our lives. Slainte Mhor.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is awesome game by there needs to be more updates because on the IPhone it updates faster make them update at the some time please.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book.....I read &#34;The Husband;s Secret&#34;  this summer in 2 days.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  You will not be disappointed.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|It was a little better than three stars but not four. Star Trek fans would get a kick out of it but all in all it is more of a pass your time book.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|Funny, melancholy, sharp, poetic.  The entire flow of this film worked for me.  It made me laugh and it made me sad - but never made me feel sorry for Mark. Instead, I just imagined the ache of hands that don't move, thoughts of never having freedom of contact - and as he approached the goal of the sessions - the terror of possibly realizing something that had been thought unattainable.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Game is so much fun. It's a blast playing with friends online. The only reason I gave it 4 out of five stars is because of the commercial advertising the force you to watch. Besides that we'll made game.
0307341550|2.0|Gillian Flynn does indeed write very well, and deserves the accolades she has received.  However, her protagonist, and the people around her in this book, are such sad, twisted people that I could not begin to empathize with any of them, and ultimately, I didn't care about the outcome.  Moreover, there are some grizzly scenes that stay with you, scenes that I did not need to add to my mental bank of what people are capable of doing.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Took a 10 day vacation and this alarm clock was awesome. The alarm adjusted it self in all the different<br />time zones however, the best part of the alarm was the alarm it self. It would come on softly then get louder over time. It would also light up my kindle so I could see in the r room.  Great app!
0307278255|3.0|After having read The Namesake and enjoyed it, I picked up other books by Jhumpa Lahiri, and must admit that as short stories, they were enjoyable, but not as much as her novel format.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I waited a long time to read this last book like so many others.  I liked it but at the same time I was disappointed that it had to end!  I wish some questions had been answered.  I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet.  But it was still a great read.  It is over and I will miss it!  Maybe I will start reading it all over again !
B001NHNG64|1.0|Like a number of other reviewers have mentioned, I recently became familiar with the Jack Reacher character and wanted to read the books in series order.  I read \\"Killing Floor\\", the first book, and really enjoyed it.  Thankfully, \\"Die Trying\\" was not the first book.  I certainly would not be reading another one.<br />I had way too many issues with the book.  First of all, there were so many implausible situations that the reader was left second guessing throughout.  One example is why the kidnappers took Reacher with them when they were out to kidnap Holly.  Another was Reacher's conclusion that the truck was going to San Francisco.  What?  How did he manage to come up with that?  Next, there were too many characters whose names, relationships and functions got lost in the detail.  By the time I got about 3/4 through, I could not keep Brogan, McGrath and some other guy straight.  Lastly, there was too much much new detail brought in at the end.<br />Based on the first book, I really like the Jack Reacher character and Lee Child's writing.  Let's hope the coming books will be more similar to that one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is my new favourite book, Nicholas Sparks has wrote the most intriguing story that keeps you interested and makes your heart ache
B001974DG0|5.0|One of the best Koontz books I've read so far. The characters and story are compelling. Koontz has brought to life the struggle between good and evil, right and wrong
B005JE7XW0|3.0|The plot hangs together.  Nice romance.  I thought the blood and gore was unnecessary. A good movie for teenage boys.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I was hooked within the first 5 pages. Such an easy fun read. I couldn't put it down. Super sexy. Super captivating.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing series. I watched all 3 seasons in days. It's drama and comedy. Lovable characters. You will love it. Must watch.
0143124544|5.0|Despite the gorgeous weather outside, and friends beckoning me to go for a walk, I couldn't put this book down all day.  Sitting on the couch with 10 pages to go, I was so engrossed that two of my boys actually asked me \\"are you OK\\"?  What a story and how well written!  I will, reluctantly, be giving this book to others since part of me wants to keep it for myself.  It is a story that is sweet, compelling and unforgettable all at the same time.  I actually discussed the story with my 16 year old son, who somewhat envious at how I could get so invested in a book.  Keep the tissues handy and be prepared for a story that will linger long after you've read the pages.  This goes onto my list of top ten favorite books.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Really funny and enjoyable read. Nice story and I certainly felt happy from the experience choosing to read this book. The main character reminded me a little of Sheldon from Big Bang Theory but just a little. It's set in Australia but it could be set in most cities.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|I love gamelofts games so when I saw this game was made by gameloft I immediately downloaded it but when I saw it was a clash of clan alike I was fanaticall I was so excited because from my previous experience playing gameloft games I loved them. And I always hoped gameloft would make a clash of clan alike and they have this game has exceeded my expectations and is cleverly unique as are all gameloft games hope to see you there get this game! :)
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I really like this cover because I can hid my Kindle from my girls on the book shelf and they have no idea that its there.
B00A8OQBD8|3.0|No lyrics or other posters in the album.  Recording is average. Good quality vinyl. Predictable music. Not much variation in their music.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|At first I was dubious about Anna and the French Kiss. I thought Etienne St-Claire was a weird name for a French guy and I'm French so I should know. But I was very pleasantly surprised. So I guess one shouldn't judge a book by one of the main character's name, lol.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This was an amazing book and I couldn't get enough if it. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who will read it.
B007TK77QE|5.0|In this novel, J.K Rowling boldly picks up her pen to deal with harsh themes, the most important ones being poverty, its consequences such as drugs, prostitution, violence, and society's responsibility for the dire circumstances some are left to live in.<br /><br />She beautifully paints a wide range of  fully fleshed out characters, whose characterizations are so craftily handled that it is impossible to see them as stiff, wooden objects. One must,  like  with Pinocchio,  readily acknowledge that they are \\"real boys\\" and girls, actual people. Teenagers against their parents, parents against  progeny, teenagers in love, fragile, desperate adults trying to act like adults, but not quite succeeding: there isn't one protagonist that can hide  its deepest,  inner thoughts from the reader or escape judgment from its stern eye.<br /><br />Furthermore, J.K Rowling's manner of proceeding is very realistic: the amount of sugarcoating is close to nil. No saint, no hero, no victor, no messiah. Just a society at war where secret  truths are revealed sometimes humorously, sometimes in a cringe-worthy manner.<br /><br />What did make me frown, I must say were the weaknesses the female characters dealt with. All the female protagonists, whether strong or feeble, held a certain amount of sickening dependence to a man. It was not so with the male protagonists whose weaknesses resided in themselves for the most part.<br /><br />Aside from this drawback, which for me is an important one, I believe  Mrs. Rowling has created a masterpiece  which every author should emulate.<br /><br />4,5 stars
B008N1V11U|1.0|Is it possible to get a refund as my one freezes. This will be really bad as Gameloft always come with great games like modern combat.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Vampires and demons, what's not to love?<br /><br />First,  the author starts out by flooding the reader with tons of info, tons of supernatural vocabulary that we know nothing about. Vampires and demons, I get. But then in a couple of pages you hear about Shadowhunters, and Raveners, Silent Brothers, the Clave, and organizations and categories and it goes on and on. So you really have to follow.<br />However the pacing of the narrative is very good. I was rarely bored, and the action moves along pretty fast so that's great.<br /><br />BUT and this a big but, I disliked Clary thoroughly!<br /><br />Clary : I thought was very boring as a main character. She was not just average, but also sometimes outright dumb. For example when she arrives in the City of Bones and asks Jace\\"Where do the Silent Brothers sleep?\\" -total facepalm moment-.<br />At first she's very reluctant to try things that might help her save her mother. I mean come on ! Her mom's the only member of her family left! A little courage, please!<br /><br />Jace : By far the character I liked the most : his wit and humor , sometimes a jerk face that's for sure. But very entertaining nevertheless.<br /><br />Simon: a very good sidekick in a Ron Weasley kind of way. Very funny although sometimes a pain.<br /><br />Valentine : Why oh why name a villain Valentine ??? It sounds too nice for a villain. I mean, Voldemort sounds threatening; but VALENTINE ?? You picture a villain with hearts and roses and candy: the worst he can do is give a bad toothache.<br /><br />All in all an average book, not without faults, but an entertaining read nevertheless which is why I give this book:<br /><br />3 STARS
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We just can't get enough of this show, we love this season and can't wait for the next! We hope season 4 is even better...if that's possible! :)
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|The acting is good, and I do remember liking the music and his playing of it.  However, Behind the Candelabra reminds me too vividly the slimy lifestyle Liberace lived.  We bought it, watched it, and then gave it away since it was not something we were likely to watch again.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Very funny as also for the Big Bang!  Love the extras with interviews with the cast that alone is worth buying the CD.
1567184855|5.0|I ab(soul)tly  love this book.  It has made me see things in a whole new way and changed my life profoundly.  Thank you Michael Newton!
B00C5R8364|5.0|This was another thriller from Frederick Forsyth that was an outstanding read. I am now hooked on his books and plan to read them all.
0393927938|5.0|i love it, and it was in pretty good conditions too and the price was fair  enought really cheap, 5 starts for that
B003WE9TU8|3.0|It's written as many interviews from people who experienced what happened from the very first signs to at the end when it's virtually over. I found it was interesting but as a novel it missed a central character and character development as each interview is from totally unrelated people.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Went to all the troubles to buy it , installed it, to find  that It does not work in Canada.Will post it on ebay.
B00000DGUG|5.0|This album is probably Alanis Morissette at her best creativity level, not only because is a step forward her JLP -which is an excellent album- but SFIJ goes beyond exploring her diary. And not only the music is a rich change, creating songs that are completely different from the usual structure is a mind-blowing (listen: 'The couch', 'I was hoping', 'Unsent', 'Fron row') her voice goes even deeper and makes us notice that her voice sounds like anybody else in the business. Powerfull, dark, and brilliant!
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|After a slightly under whelming and lower energy ABIII, Fortress is brings back the higher energy that was found on many tracks off Blackbird.  There are a few slow tracks as well, but most of the album turns it up a notch.  A couple of the riffs sound like they could have shown up on Mark Tremonti's solo project which is more metal influenced.<br /><br />Fortress isn't a good as Blackbird from start to finish, but it's a close second in their discography.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This has been a very enjoyable show to watch.  I love the clothes, the house and all of the characters.  Without giving anything away, I absolutely did NOT like the way season 3 ended.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I got a kick out of this one.  The main characters were fun and easy to like. The author was very descriptive.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing beyond belief. It's tears at your heart strings and rekindles your belief in true love. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It was a great read.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|you should get it littlest pet shop is better but this one is still fun so get them both but siurisly littlest pet shop is so fun
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I have seen each Mission Impossible movie and Ghost Protocol is easily my favorite. With Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Cruise all working together, this movie is an instant classic. To anyone who hasn't seen this movie I highly recommend it to the highest extent.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Really like this album and the songs on it.  Can't stop listening to it.  Would highly recommend to any considering.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I have seen every Supernatural season more than once and this season is one of if not my most favorite next to season 5. The leviathans make this season a must have and worth owning. If you like Supernatural and you don't own this you need to get it immediately!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|it does not work , it give you a code that you enter and you put it in and it doent work
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I am very happy with supernatural season 8. It is one of my most favorite seasons and to have to the eighth season just completes my collection. For any supernatural fans this season is a must have!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read this book based on several personal recommendations. I enjoyed the book to a point. Several twists and turns in plot made the second half unbelievable. I finished the book angry with the ending and angry I wasted my time. Cant believe this was a best-seller. And don't count on me to see the movie either. UGH!
B00BGI08GG|5.0|I was skeptical of the Arrow series when it came out, but when I sat down and watched the series Green Arrow became one of my most favorite superheroes ever! This show brings Green Arrow to the TV setting so perfectly that I cannot wait to watch all of the second season and I highly recommend buying this season for anyone who calls themselves a Green Arrow fan and to start watching Arrow so they can get into season two as soon as possible!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is perhaps Khaled s best book yet! Rarely do I have the enjoyment of such a well written book that I find myself unwilling, unable, and und e
B00DJYJRHG|1.0|1º the language was latin spanish..... not spanish of SPAIN ...( in description dont appears latin spanish just &#34;spanish&#34;)<br />2º the box arrived to me broken, and inside the place where was the discs, pulled away from the box.<br />3º I had to wait almost 1 month....<br /><br />to bad...
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|Sci-fi to me is like bacon or chocolate.  There really is no such thing as too much and none of it is ever bad no matter what the quality.  So while I wasn't expecting any deep reflections, aha moments or outstanding effects I was, at least, expecting to see the ruins of old earth, since that's so easy to do with CGI, and the story of how that happened.  And while the McGuffin device has been used very effectively by Hitchcock to produce fear and in Melville to produce excitement in After Earth it just sucked.  It's basically a Mcguffin flick if flicks could be made by a Vanity Press Director.  And just in case no one got it's a journey movie, this film is so bad that it actually pictured in one scene and mentioned in another the great novel Moby Dick, without any connection to the action, plot or back story at all.  But as a device it was lost on this garbage film.  No one was hunting anything but someone probably thought it deep to have that there.  The freshman film students would get it.  No one else woud.<br />I judge film the same way I do art.  Like the blue slash on the white canvass that adorned the entrance to the Freer in DC 40 years ago on the day I ended a 7 year relationship by disclosing how little I appreciated the artistic musings of the great painter who decided to dip his brush in blue paint and draw a horizontal line.  I apparently couldn't appreciate all kinds of meaning and depth because the painter was important, prominent, historic, etc. but all I saw was a blue slash.  If I can do it it's not art.  This movie is like that.  It has the pedigree of Will Smith but no substance.  In fact I found myself wandering to the sink to finish the dishes hoping for a reveal of a reborn earth or a cataclysmic discovery that earth had been occupied by aliens or something.  Nope.  A handful of poorly designed not scary monsters attempted and failed to capture Jr even though they were clearly supposed to be superb predators.  Then Jr is saved by a giant eaglefrom freezing.  Did I mention how bad this movie is?  I suppose they're rescued because in the next to last scene he gets the beacon and sets it off then suddenly he's back on wherever and credits roll.<br />Note to crappy set designers.  We will still have beds in 3100 AD like we did in 3000 BC.<br />When Jr starts out in pursuit of the beacon, Daddy/General asks \\"What do you feel?\\"  Jr says \\"heavy\\" and Daddy/General says \\"Good that's gravity.\\"<br />I wonder if the audience laughed as hard as I did.  So add crappy script to rotten lazy set design queue the CGI swarming stuff and herding animals and the music swells to reveal a planet that freezes over completely at night in spite of the tropical foliage that covers everything.  And don't forget to throw in a few flash backs to the dead sister (who liked to read Moby Dick) just to create what, depth?  At least she had enough lines to qualify for health insurance.  And while I'm still trying to figure out how Judge Dredd wiped his ass with that clam shell 20 years ago nothing so useful as that seems to have been stowed on this spacecraft.  Except a hideous monster who can smell fear that's to be used in training.  Let's call him Spot.  Spot's demise was never explained as far as I could tell.  Meanwhile Jr. has more important things to do like ignore everything his father says so he gets chased by GCI apes.  Oooh scary.  Judge Dredd is suddenly not the worst sci-fi movie ever made.<br />Dialogue like \\"If you want to die today that is fine but you're not going to kill me.\\"  Well Daddy, actually if he wants to die you will die so no it's not fine.  In response to getting scratched poor Jr. suddenly  needs to inject something into his heart because what's a good medical emergency cliché without that.  Not once but twice.  The $5.99 they can keep but there should be a toll free number where you can call to get your lost time back.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put this down and was constantly asked by my husband, &#34;Are you finished reading, yet?&#34;  Romantic, exciting and a great story line!  Would and will recommend to all my friends.  Thank you, E L James.
B001DDBCUK|2.0|it has left out part of movie and not even R-rated parts !!  sorry I bought it- save your money-
1401938906|5.0|I am so pleased with this book, it's so full of great ideas.  and I'm at a place in my life where I'm seeking wisdom.
0545265355|5.0|I bought the boxed set because I kept hearing about how great the first book was. I was hooked from the start! Awesome books. I really enjoyed the first two books, the third was okay.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|This CD is really good and goes back to roots of old Black Sabbath days. The CD resembles their N.I.B. album from 1969 which is the year I think that album came out. The more I listen to it the more I like it. So for all you fans of goth metal, and heavy metal, or hard rock this is for you.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Good sound and service.  Delivered as promised.  Played audio book fine.  Only problem I have is that it blocks my cup holder and ashtray that I used to hold money.  Product itself is wonderful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a AMAZING game and everybody In my family loves it!! The graphics are AWESOME!!!! =)  but... sometimes it glitches when I go up a ramp. But other than that it's an awesome game and I would defiantly recommend this game to everyone even a grown-up!!!
B008JJM88Q|2.0|Cant read the questions because the text is outside the comment bubble.  Get bored with it after ten minutes or less.
B0052FDRI0|5.0|This is actually my favorite Black Veil Brides album so far. That's not to say the other's aren't incredible. They are. This album just has a ton of songs that resonate with me. 'God Bless You' is an amazing bluesy type power rock about letting go and moving on. 'Fallen Angels' is really an anthemic power rock song that leaves you screaming with the band. 'Saviour' is a beautiful power ballad from the band to the fans. 'Ritual' is really one of my all time favorites though, with the chorus being to 'rise up and celebrate your life'. 'The Legacy' begins with Ashley Purdy's funky bassline and CC's rapid drumming which leads in to another amazing anthemic power rock song that I simply can't get enough of. The song 'New Religion' seems to be a precursor to their next album &#34;Wretched and Divine&#34; which is a concept album that.. just has to be experienced! I love this band and will be a proud member of the BVB Army for life!
159463176X|3.0|I did read the whole thing but felt at the end as if there were too many things that happened.  Some things seemed irrelevant and unnecessary.  The members of my book all felt the same way. We had enjoyed the pervious two books.  Thins one was too contrived.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This book is told from the first person perspective of a sarcastic Druid. Since sarcasm is my first language (I can't wait for someone to read this and find a grammar mistake and mention how lucky I am that Sarcasm is my first language because he ain't too good with the English) I immediately felt a kinship with Atticas, and could not put the book down wanting to find out what happens next. For example I just finished the book, it's 0511am on a Sunday morning....I Will most certainly continue this series!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|This is a really fun CD. Who can go wrong with GaGa? Great music, fun to listen, dance, and drive (not necessarily at the same time) while playing.  I highly recommend this CD.
B000GT7XXW|5.0|Kenneth Branagh has succeeded in bringing adaptations of Shakespeare to the screen that are vibrant, timely, and yet thoroughly true to the original. This should come as little surprise; in his most recent direction of &#34;Thor&#34; he was able to take one of the least relatable heroes in comic history and simultaneously give the main character humanity and the text gravitas.  Hamlet presented something the opposite problem; taking text that was too rich and dense to be easily relatable to modern ears and make it yet come alive. And while (at over 4 hours running time) he did not compromise in the adaptation, he did yet manage to plumb the essential humanity of the Bard's characters while turning in a remarkable performance in the title role. Well worth viewing, perhaps over a couple of evenings.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|She really liked the book, she read it in just two days. She has all the books, but this one was her favorite!
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I use this in my class to connect the kids to the French Revolution.  They like it and so do I.
B00A77II0U|3.0|This was a fun game. It had a lot of hidden object scenes, but it was not very challenging. It was enjoyable and worth buying.<br />.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this opccupies me and my daughter. everywhere we go and its fun and has some great humorous that reminds. you of the movie!
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I waited a couple months to view this (I had just seen a live performance).  I had tears in my eyes during some of the songs.  I had the hardest time trying to figure out which recording would be the best.  I can only say, I thoroughly enjoy this version.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|We watched this with our children and were shocked to see total nudity in the first disc.  That pretty much ruined the rest of it for us because we never knew what was coming.  Unfortunate that they had to include that making it not suitable for family watching.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I ordered this after seeing a live performance.  Tears in my eyes.  Hair standing up on the back of my neck and arms.  Absolutely beautiful.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great book.  Kept me interested the entire time.  Once you pick it up you will not put it down.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This shit is horrible and bad and cool tho say I'm not cool but I say yes vert information and lol
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Awesome book! I can't wait for her new book to come out!!!!! This is one of those books that will stick to you like glue.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I enjoyed the book tremendously. @ 1/4 of way into i started to doubt if I would but then it gripped me and I loved it.  In my book club of 8 - 5 liked it 3 din't care for it.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I tried to log in my kik  but it didn't work. I even put a new account it still didn't work. This is the worst texting app ever. Can someone  fix this app please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This app needs to be fixed right now. &lt;:(
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Here is a true story of a family of affluence and character (a rare combination) who takes in a stray boy out of love and not pity. It is a story that teaches how unselfishness can result in our growth as people.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Oh My God... ! O_O I WILL recommend this book to EVERYONE !! This book is not only a ROMANCE packed novel, but an ACTION as well. And I love it! :) This book is definitely at the TOP of my FAVORITE BOOKS list as well.
B00F3YHMUE|5.0|Great album!  It's in storyboard format for his upcoming Broadway play, but the music within it could easily stand alone.  It's also his first album of entirely original material in ten years.  Excellent music paired with witty and well-placed lyrics...a must have for true fans of Sting!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Why do you guy try to suck money out of us. I mean times are rough and I can't spend like $30 on a virtual horse what the crap. My sister loves this game but sorry I don't you guys suck!!!!!!!!!&gt;:(
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love it! It is awesome! I really like that you can not only play on the bird side, but also the pork side also I love that you can get many different characters!
B00138H4CK|5.0|A very enjoyable concert with incredible performances. Wish I could have been there to see the concert myself but no such luck.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I use TubeMate on a daily basis with very little uses if any. Then, popped up this upgrade today...NOT ONE SONG, WITHOUT FREEZING UP!!! I want my OLD, GOOD TubeMate back!!! Then, I will give a higher star, until then I'm looking for a new app.
034580709X|3.0|The perpetrator is killed by being eaten by a Great White Shark?  Really?  The shark swallowed him more easily than I swallowed this convoluted plot.  Now that I think of it, three stars is generous.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I'm getting older myself so this move was somewhat relevant. I could definitely relate to the horney old guy !!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun game. Keeps your interest the way they move the items around in the rooms. Better than always in the ssme place.
B00E8B1358|3.0|It's exactly what it advertised itself to be. A bang 'em up shoot 'em up movie. so it was just ok
B008LXZFH6|4.0|I'm a big fan of most of the actors in this movie, and they all performed exactly how I'd like to see them.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I thought it was entertaining. I'm just getting tired of watching Tom Cruise as the tragic anti-hero saving the world from annihilation. Do ya think he could try something else?
B0091THRCU|5.0|When I first purchased my iPhone 5, I looked at many, many cases. Keeping in mind that once I had dropped my phone and cracked the face, I wanted something that covered the face. I was willing to buy something expensive yet I wanted the phone to be reasonably accessible. I had picked one case that wasn't available for a few weeks, so I ordered the Snugg as an interim case. Much to my surprise, it worked so well (and I just ordered a 2nd one because I lost my first), Snugg was the solution. The pull elastic was a little tight at first, but it quickly loosens a bit (but does NOT stretch, even after a year of use) and works quickly to pull my phone out.  What a great answer and equally great price. Highly recommend.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|No real discovery on the son's part Did Dad really need to be in the movie? I don't think so
B000007TJQ|5.0|TOMORROW NEVER DIES is one of the best of the Bonds. Roger Spottiswoode did a bang-up job as director handling the action sequences and delivering the script's more timely and coherent storyline to the screen. Pierce Brosnan gets down to business and returns to more familiar territory and storytelling in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. This is the only Brosnan-Bond film where the team of M, Moneypenny, Charles Robinson and Q work as a very efficient and cohesive unit. When of the best things to come along in years was composer David Arnold who scored this film. He continued the sound created by John Barry and simultaneously brought the action to a more modern film-making experience. TOMORROW NEVER DIES is one of the best Bond films of the series.
B00E1SJDJG|5.0|No lengthy review here... Just dropping in to say this is a fantastic album, which is to be expected from Bill Callahan. He never disappoints me. Lovely from start to finish.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I love the Big Bang and having this DVD makes it easy to satisfy my adiction. Love it as I did the easy purchase and fast delvery.
B00AX6KNOY|4.0|This is a good movie from the old days. Alien body snatchers trying to take over earth. Actors were so young. Wow how time flies.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Not a big Tom Crues fan and this film did little to fix that. In Tom's Defence the overal film atributes were just as mediocure. Wish it had been better but it was OK. The Twisted ending will leave you thinking.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Not my usual reading, but it was good just the same.  I don't even know how to describe it...  It's intesting to see how all the characters lives collide.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I read a lot, and in my opinion, this was one of THE best books I have read!  I love Moriarty's style of writing.
B003DDKAT2|5.0|This is the foundation of the vampire stories entertainment industry. I definitely recommend watching this to anyone looking for a good vampire movie.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|so fun and a good game for those who like to race. it has some of the best cars and maps. hands down a great game
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I thought this was the sickest series I have ever read. I was hoping there would be something to these pages without disturbing sex being the main focus!
B009XY97VC|4.0|This is a lot more sophisticated than Two Steps from Hell's previous albums. Some of the tracks work, and some don't. There are several good tracks on this album, and a few duds. Overall, I would recommend this if you like their other albums. Give it a few listens if you don't like it at first. I didn't like it the first time through.<br />I still prefer Audiomachine, but this is good.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I was expecting a bit more, there are some quite boring parts. But jennifer lawrence is always beatifull. Many parts are top predictable.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The characters were shallow and had no personalities, the plot was rather slow and drawn-out, and the writing was uninspired and awkward. I see now the price is $0, so that seems like the right price.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|If you are looking for action, this is it. Not much character development. Definitely short on the relationship between dad & son. A good fun run though. Just don't expect academy award work.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is a great device for streaming content from Netflix, Hulu and other applications to a TV and it works as expected.  I am enjoying it very much.
B00005JKES|4.0|This series is iconic. It isn't sure if it is a 50's show or dated to the time it was made. Fun to watch some of the actors in their early days. I never got to see the show when it was origanally on TV due to work schedule, but I can see why it was so popular.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Not the best and dragonvale is so much better don't get this it looks way better here than in the game. Dragonvale is like my most favorite game ever and don't get this or the pet shop game you know with the cute yellow puppy on the icon? Yeah- that's bad too. I deleted both. So if this game and the pet game is by the same team- lava- then team lava needs to make like way better games, just sayin.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I was really happy with this season of Dexter. I will be so unhappy that there is only one season left. I love the books this tv series is loosely based on, but this tv series does justice to the character all on its own. It is like watching a different direction taken by the character. Dexter stays true to the main character in the books, but goes down a different path in the series. I just think this is a great show but not for under 15. Even older teens should have an adult with them while they watch.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Omg omg!!! This is officially my favorite game and its SO perfect! You breed awesome dragons, feed them, they grow big, then they earn you so much gold! So then you can buy more food and get them all the way to level 20!!! One of my most favorite parts of this amazing(not to mention free) is the variety of dragons, you never know what type you're gonna get next! Don't get Dragon story! :)
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This show has continued to keep us glued to the story. The acting is still top knotch. The story remains fluid. A nice blend of horror, comedy, and drama.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is sooooo cool but I wish you could change your skin but beside the skin IT IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|I was surprised this was not as lame as all the critics made it out to be. I found it to be entertaining. More violence than expected. Not a fairy tale for young ones. Not an academy award performance, but fun.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|A original toy that in Chile will not look. It`s the birthday`s gift that my son wanted, LEGO, my son thanks you.
B00BB67UNW|5.0|I was very happy with this one. Not for younger kids but definitely full of action as well as thought. The characters are true to form and Wahlberg does a great job with his character. Really enjoyed this movie.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Very Good!!! A new toy, that don't see in this part of world. My son is enjoying. Lego is one.
034580404X|5.0|Nothing like having all three books!  Received this as a gift set and have purchased 2 more for friends.  You and they will have a hard time putting this book down.  My friends were so happy to get this set.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|It`s cool. A new toy, that don't see in this part of world. My son is enjoying. Lego is one.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|After listening to &#34;Love Story meets Viva la Vida&#34; and watching the YouTube video, i heard other pieces and had to get this CD. Was NOT disappointed! They do one heck of a job!
B002CMXAYW|5.0|This movie is Hilarious. How can you not love a band that has custom amps made that go to '11' and is known as the loudest band of all time?
B003DO13O2|5.0|Fell in love with &#34;Tubular Bells&#34; even before the movie 'Exorcist' came out, and during the days of vinyl LP's I got this album and treasured it, too, along with the other albums after. With the demise of the vinyl LP and the growing CD revolution, I got the 'Boxed' set, and then the 2010 remix, and was sad that Mr. Oldfield changed the mix on both. Sorry Mr. Oldfield, the original LP mix was the best! Then I found this CD set with the original mix just like my original LP, and all was right with the world again......
0811879542|5.0|Love this book..so thoughtfully simple. Every time I read this book to a group of children it brings the house down. I wish I'd thought of it!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|The Piano Guys are very good at what they do. Got hooked on them from a YouTube video of &#34;Love Story meets Viva la Vida&#34; and then listened to their other recordings. Wow. Got this CD and #1 and they are great!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I felt unloved by my partner because although I do appreciate his many qualities the fact that he never expresses love verbally or physically has killed my love for him.  No surprise that I rank words of affirmation and physical touch nearly equally as my top languages.  I will be much more aware in future relationships.
B003DO13OC|5.0|Finally found a CD with the original mix of this 'album'. Originally bought the vinyl LP back in the '70's and loved it! Ever since changing over to CD's I've wished he would release this album. The 'remix' that came out with the 'boxed' version wasn't the same, as was the 2010 version. I must disagree with Mr. Oldfield as the original version that was released on vinyl LP's was the best.....
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Seemed to be relatively simple but set off a series of problems with connectivity with my NetGear router and I had to pay tho get the NetGear people to go back over all the settings. I have it synced to my PC, iPad and Internet TV but not to my iPhone. Now that it is set up it works quite well, but it did seem to precipitate some router problems.
0062238868|5.0|I just could not put this book down. Chris wrote this in simple form, explained and shared his experience as a sniper in Iraq in such a way that it was enjoyable. I too was not really fond of the quotes from his wife in the book, but do see the point of them being in there. This book is well worth reading and you will not be disappointed. This is a book that I will read again down the road it was that good.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|As usual, the author beguiles you with his twists and turns, backs and forths with a story quite timely in light of the recent revelations made by Edward Snowden. Like many others, you never realize where the story will end until the final word. Bravo!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|If you need a quick update on your Facebook page, this is the ticket. It's easy to view and work with, too.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Thin plot, moderately interesting, average acting, dumb and implausible ending. Not sure why I watched the whole thing. Just remember that this is only MY opinion based on my standards for entertainment.  It may have a different affect on you.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This is the best season for Downton Abbey.  Everything becomes more interesting and you begin to understand the characters fully.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book will take you to fanciful places and force you to explore your own ideas about reality. You will fall in love with the circus and find yourself longing to be there. You will be helpless to stop yourself from becoming a reveur. Bon chance!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This was the first book we downloaded for our son on the Kindle Fire.  The download went really fast, and he really enjoys reading it from the Kindle.  It is exactly like the book version, but it is cheaper for the download, and you have it immediatly available for viewing instead of having to wait a few days for it to be delivered from Amazon.  If you don't mind not having the actual book, this is for you.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Pretty good book.  Touches on the lifespan of a genius, and faintly hints towards the abomination that took place with him.  It also shows the way that politics can distort the true nature of what actually occurs, and is recorded, or not recorded, in textbooks and the like.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you think outside of the box!  Great game! Have a pen and paper handy. Need more rooms to explore.
B00FDSUJ0A|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed the album. Most of the songs are very catchy and got stuck in my head. Some of the songs were only okay and got skipped after I listened to them a time or two. The album is definitely worth a listen, though.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I'm not an avid reader of King or otherwise. Although I am an avid horror fan, often times questioning why? Sadly the novel Dr.Sleep which I just had to read, doesn't' provide any clarity.I'm sorry to say it left me less than impressed. Sequels by nature, tend to be a disappointment, but I had so hoped for an exception. Thirty years later, I think Dr. Sleep should have just been put to sleep, and the classic left to continue to Shine! I'm not saying it's a bad read, but obviously had a tough reputation to follow between both the original novel and the film. Even taking the latter out of the equation, it just doesn't' live up. It comes off as would, a made for TV movie. Any scary element surpassed by the weird, meaningless, or Harry potter nature of .
B0031RSA24|4.0|This is very interesting read which provides a step by step argument against the usual defences put forth by believers and agnostics alike
156224003X|5.0|I almost didn't give this book a shot because of some of the low reviews talking about how this book is a bunch of new age dross.  I admit that there were some holistic new agey passages in there book that made me furrow my brow a bit, but to pass up this book because of a few hokey paragraphs would be a huge mistake!  If you approach this book with an open mind, it will give you the tools to cut through all the static and just PLAY...
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Although I've never been an inmate (thankfully), I've been in a prison twice. Spring Street Prison in Richmond, Va as part of my sociology class and a second, more recent time, when I did a citizen police ride along. Ms. Kerman gives the back story of these people's lives and how easily anyone could find themselves on this situation. Well done. Would love to hear more about her life now. Sequel?
B002NWXRYY|5.0|this is an awesome comedy I love it it's Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn at their best they're hilarious together I enjoyed it very much
B00F52YOPA|4.0|It's a great game! Just wish there were more rooms to make over and more items to choose from. Otherwise, it is excellent brain stimulation. My 84 year old mom loves it too!
0345803485|1.0|You know how, when a movie is made from a book, and everyone says that the book was better?  Yea... that's not going to happen here.  The movie will have to suck royally with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog playing Ana and Christian to be worse than this book!  My hopes were high so I bought all three books!  Dummy me. What a waste of money.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Really enjoying learning Spanish this way.  I like the multiple teaching methods that reinforce different learning styles, i.e reading, writing, speaking, listening, translating both ways.  It's a bit addictive, in a good way.  And it's free!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I like this app because it it is fun to play with my cousins when playing guns or army men.It works great on kindle fire and is loads of fun
B003F46RVO|5.0|This movie was good always heard about it and finally watched it. Def a movie I would purchase. Good movie for Halloween time
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Looking for a family night movie? Well you've found it. Despicable me is such a hilarious movie! Something for the adults & children...
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Not really sure how I like this yet.  I bought it for the trip we are currently on and it didn't work in one of the car outlets and we discovered that the outlet was not working.<br />Once home, I doublechecked the product in another car and it seemed to work okay.
0316227706|5.0|This book is WONDERFUL!  If you are a dog lover, or know a dog lover, this book is a must!  Just made me smile from beginning to end!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game it is like deer hunter reloaded but cooler you all should buy it better than after earth yeah I'm calling you out boy
B000001OAA|5.0|It's exactly what I wanted it works and it's not scratched. There isn't a whole lot less that I could expect from it.
B001BANK32|5.0|This was a great book. A lot better than the movie. Way better. I really enjoyed it. I see why king  hated the movie.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It won't let me log in. It tells me that it's taking longer than it should. I love kik, but they definitely need to fix this.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Padlecki's character continues to be whiny and tiresome.  I am curious though to see what is up with Sam's flashbacks.  (I'm still watching on DVD.)  The story line is good and so far there is nothing in the development of the story or characters that would make me stop watching the series.  I have enjoyed the re-introduction and development of the character of Benny and his complicated relationship with Dean.  It's refreshing to see Dean with another partner.  This series has been solidly interesting throughout its 8/9 year run, and not many series can say that (including &#34;True Blood&#34; which is nowhere near that 8 year mark).  A consistently interesting program.
B009SJ46EA|5.0|I was very skeptical before watching this, I even hesitated to watch it. Oh how I regret waiting it was so good!!!!!!  They did an amazing job by conveying the whole 1960's theme! The ending was proper closure! A must watch!
B00004TDTO|4.0|I got the wrong movie (DaVinci Code) in the mail but it was a good movie so I kept It
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app for freeing up space on Kindle Fire.  And it's free and easy to use.  Great addition to your apps.
B0035HKWLW|3.0|I've seen the movie before, Jim Carey is okay but I think his dog out preformed him in the movie...
0385351399|2.0|I bought this book because I had enjoyed a couple of Eggers' nonfiction books, but it was a big letdown.  It was based on an intriguing idea but the writing was uninspired, none of the characters was likeable enough to care what happened to them and there was no suspense--it was obvious what was going to happen from the beginning.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Why pay HBO $16 per month to see the series, you can find out what's happening in the book and need not get the paid cable version.....
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed the book immensely and found it painted an enlightening and thought provoking picture. Some characters were a little stereotypical but not unbelievable.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|My daughter loved this movie, now she has children of her own.  Delightful way to spend a night enjoying this family classic.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my Kindle.  I love being able to have a small library at my finger tips, but what about when I'm at the doctor's office or at the hardware store with my husband?  I love my Kindle apps.  They all sync with each other and so I am always at the &#34;right&#34; place no matter which devise I was last using to read.  Awesome!
B00942Y4IY|4.0|I recall when they tried to make this into a TV series because of the huge success at the box office when the movie was released.
B00EXVZW6E|1.0|I love the hidden objects games. Several of them can be just to hard to see. This game is one of them. I couldn't make out half the items on the pedestals, and spending time finding the items could send one to the eye doctor!<br /><br />I've tried a few hidden object games that were enjoyable and not so hard on the eyes....why can't this be the same?  Kindle Fire HD 7 here. If ever get a larger screened tablet in the future I would love to try this one again because  it looks like a bit of creepy fun.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Good graphics for what it is, and there are a lot of cool dragons, but that's about it. I've logged on to discover my layout moved around at random, and eleven an odd purchase I didn't make.  I've contacted support regarding missing purchases, but got no reply.  Lame. The economy and reward system in just about every similar game is better too. I recommend Dragonvale or Creatures of Olympus. Otherwise, if you really want to see the dragons in this game in action, just visit a high level player's island.
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|I don't understand these complaints as this is MUCH more robust than Instagram. And yes, all the social media sharing tools are there, too. Are people just not paying attention? I love it.
3442217784|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad's author Robert Kiyosaki simply tells a stories in the book. But true reading can change the way we think about money. I've read it more than twenty times and still want to read it. If you're ambitious or if you care about your finances, I recommend it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I don't know what I did before downloading this app. My kindle runs better and faster now. Anytime it starts to bog down, I just &quot;clean&quot; it and it's just like new again.
B009WUBERW|2.0|Expendables = Predictsbles. No desire to see the original. Incongruent jumps from the ground to the airplane. Poorly written. Chuck was the highlight.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is good only that sometimes it doesnt work very well but it is fun and beuty i love it
B00ADQPB50|5.0|This is one of THE best series ever... Creepy as Hell. I loved the first AMHS and this one is equally great, and so very different. What I appreciate as a viewer (now watching the third AMHS Coven) is that most all of the same actresses and actors are in all series. And I will say Jessica Lange is AMAZING!!!!! I believe she makes all of these series completely unique. She's such a classy, talented lady!! Love her!! And LOVE this American Horror Story...
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|I think this is Janelle's best album to date! Her previous where great but this is simply BRILLIANT! I love the classic R&B fuzed with Funk, and Rock! I love the Electric side of it with the Guitar and vocals.<br /><br />All in all I would highly recommend it because it's not like every other album. She strives to be different while paying homage to the greats like Prince and Stevie Wonder (This album reminds me a little of Stevie's album &#34;Songs in the Key of Life&#34;.)
B00005RIKI|5.0|This album is worth getting for the song Freebird alone.  But that wouldn't be all you would get.  The first 4 songs are all good too.  This might be their best studio album.
0307476073|4.0|I enjoyed Wild and found myself curious to find out what happens each day on the trail and was invested in the final outcome. I thought the book was very well written, although a memoir written so many years after the actual events has to rely on a lot of reconstructed dialogue from faded memories, and in that way this was balanced between a fictional account and an actual one.<br /><br />The author's moral failings, her selfishness and her lack of common sense did not bother me at all, as it did other reviewers. I prefer the characters in books not be saints but rather people who are flawed and struggling, otherwise there is no drama in their achievements. After all, how could this author be \\"found\\" if she was not previously \\"lost?\\" I am more inclined to believe that the author's moral \\"straying\\" was exaggerated for effect. She only dabbled in drug use and promiscuity prior to her trek, and only dabbled in promiscuity during, so she was at least halfway improved. And to be clear, Strayed was NOT a heroin addict or this would have been a totally different book, the heroin addict in my family would not be \\"found\\" even after a 1100 mile hike over the PCT.<br /><br />I think that the death of Strayed's mother was the soil which sprouted the roots of her great angst, setting her out on the healing path of the PCT but I lost my own mother a few months ago and even in my own deep grief I found much of her emotional state of dysfunction following this loss to be incomprehensible and some of it probably made up for dramatic effect. This was the least interesting (and most unbelievable) part of the story. I did not find the author's life prior to her hike across the PCT to be all that despairing or different from many people who go through loss and divorce and in their twenties a rudderless kind of life.<br /><br />But I did love her PCT journey. Her description of \\"Monster\\" her overfilled backpack, the unexpected weight of water (8 lbs per gallon) and the plugs for REI and Snapple (two of my own personal indulgences), the meaning of shelter and safety, the importance of food and a little spare change, and the bonding with fellow hikers she encountered along the way were very enjoyable to read. In fact I loved this part of the book so much I can forgive the boring (and overly written) rest. Four stars Cheryl, enjoyed the trip.Snapple (two of my own personal indulgences), the meaning of shelter and safety, the importance of food and a little spare change, and the bonding with fellow hikers she encountered along the way were very enjoyable to read.

B000003CMC|5.0|This may very well be the next best album to get by this band after Live at the Fillmore.  It has Mellissa and the live rocking song Mountain Jam.  This would be a great second purchase after Live at the Fillmore.
B0014H32MG|3.0|An easy read for Stephen King while still keeping your interest. The film is old enough that a lot of people may not have seen or remember it. Seems like it could almost be longer and more in depth. Doesn't have the meat that most of his later books have.
B00000DOZ6|5.0|This is among Zeppelin's best efforts.  The others being 2, 4, and Physical Graffiti.  It has the hits D'yer Ma'ker and Over the Hills and Far Away.  The rest of the album is good from start to finish just like the other albums I mentioned.  A must have for any Zeppelin fan or a fan of classic rock in general.
0385344228|4.0|This murder mystery is incredibly suspenseful, with just the right amount of foreshadowing to keep you guessing until the end. I had a really hard time putting the book down- which to me is the sign of a great book!
B000KJU1MS|5.0|Anyone who wants to see Kiss at their 70's peak, should get this DVD.  The concerts from 76 and 77 alone are worth the purchase.  You also get a lot more than that, especially from their early days.  If you are a fan of the Alive album this DVD is a must have.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|Really glad that I came accross this item!  It is big enough that you can take your legos with you.  I have been putting the built legos in it while my son plays with them.
B005USZML4|3.0|Grisham is at the top of my favorite authors, just wasnt too excited about this book.  First time for sure.  Doesn't mean I wont continue to read his work.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I've read some rather pointed critique about this film, however I found the film entertaining and although they sometimes &#34;give the plot line away&#34; in still delivers a couple of decent twists and surprises. There are precious few decent sci-fi films today, so against this sad background I found Oblivion to be a refreshing and positive experience. The story is plausible and the pacing is good. Tom Cruise may be a wacky person off-screen but he continues to deliver some very credible performance in exactly the way that Bruce Willis does not (try watching &#34;A Good Day to Die Hard&#34; to see how far Bruce has fallen from his &#34;Twelve Monkeys&#34; days). So kudos to Tom Cruise, the supporting cast, the story, the photography, special effects and the Director for pulling off a complex film. I've watched this film 3 times and it still pleases - few films do that for me. I find techno-trash films like Prometheus to be depressingly stupid - Oblivion was a really nice surprise by comparison.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Just one of those not have to think too much fun games that you do not want to put down. Challenging and fun.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I admit I was skeptical about this film - so many positive reviews tend to set expectations too high. But this film really does deliver.<br /><br />This is a really good piece of story telling and to stitch the film together without giving away the solution is a rare treat these days. Heck, I can usually work out the plot line of an entire film from the trailers alone, so I was pleasantly surprised. An excellent story could easily have been ruined by heavy handed or incompetent Direction or a poor screenplay. Fortunately the people in charge of this film really know their craft. This is a film that demands you pay attention, but makes doing so very easy indeed. Although some big name stars are associated with &#34;Now You See Me&#34;, it is truly an ensemble production in which everyone contributes to the success of the finished product.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Its annoying it will not let me log in. I love this app please fix this problem. It keeps sayin error occurred taking longer than usual. I have a kindle fire and i want to text my friend but with this i cannot so im giving it one star until it gets fixed
B0052SF6CM|4.0|There are a few songs that I skip over and there are songs a play over. It was good for the price.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I think that this game is probably a little better than the rest of them. It's got great graphics and sweet cars. Right now I'm not a very high level but it's still fun. The multi player is super fun too.
B005PXXDP6|5.0|what can't be said about Kurt Cobain and Nirvana and this classic album that has not been written about? it always makes top 10 album lists in magazines and websites everywhere from critics and fans alike, the band and album changed music forever. after this album every record company went looking for the next alternative rock band which produced some great new bands and also a lot of crap and clones of the Nirvana and Seattle sound. I recently purchased this cd cause i saw in a magazine review that it had bsides rare live tracks and early demos of nevermind era songs.the live tracks and early versions and demos of the album  are reason enough for any fan of Nirvana to buy this cd again since all Nirvana fans already have the orginal album. listening to the album in the last few days I thought the remastered album sounds better than ever and the bbc sessions from 1991 which were broadcast on a British radio show are great i heard some of these songs on a radio tribute special years ago when Kurt first passed away. the best tracks are the electric version of Something In The Way which has drums on it and Drain You which was a live version on the same program. the live tracks Been A Son live is one of the best it was always a very powerful song live and shows what a great live band Nirvana were . the bides i have heard some of these from the boxed set With The Lights out that i bought but this is a nice sample of bsides from this era for anyone who does not want to buy that 4 disc set . D-7 was a great bside and could of been on an album great cover song also Even In His Youth was the bside of Teen Spirit i remember buying a cd single back in the day of these two tracks , Sappy was an early version of Verse Chorus Verse which turned up on a various artists album. overall the  extra tracks are reason enough to buy remastered cd's of bands or singers.any Nirvana fan will enjoy the extra songs on this album I would urge any fan of 90's alternative rock to buy this album and turn on anyone in this new generation to real music which the 1990's were the last decade of good music!and turn on anyone in this new generation to real music which the 1990's were the last decade of good music!
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|Alicia and company survive in their legal world amidst secrets and loyalty. Each week has a fresh new turn. Awesome entertainment and better than trying to watch on the network that interrupts their fine programming with delayed starting times and too many commercials. Definitely worth the price of the program on Amazon.
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|Really digging this new EP. So happy to have new music from these talented, hardworking musicians. Love Scott Weiland -- always have, always will -- but unfortunately that ship has sailed. Chester brings new life to this great band. Here's to the future -- rock on, STP!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|A beautifully brutal story about friendship and first love and all of those messy, gloriously imperfect spaces in between. My heart hurts after reading this, in the very best of ways. Eleanor and Park is what every YA book should strive to be -- honest and perplexing, painful and hopeful. An absolute must-read.
B004WO9F56|5.0|Awsome, greate show, good sound and screenplay, perfect  to remember their show in Costa Rica, till the next visit :)
B004BUGCRK|5.0|It's entirely possible that if Sting were to release an album in which he spends 90 minutes imitating various whale mating calls, I'd still love it, because, well, it's Sting.  That being said, this is a terrific album.  We own a copy of pretty much every song Sting has ever recorded, but occasionally it's nice to listen to new renditions of beloved favorites.  Live music also has a different energy, which  helps to &#34;mix things up a bit&#34; when you're listening to your &#34;Sting playlist&#34;!  The album also contains a little bit of verbal commentary, which gives you a chance to appreciate his adorable northern burr.  Yes, I'm a huge fan, and as a huge fan, I was not disappointed.  I'd highly recommend Live in Berlin!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game challenging enough to hold my attention. Need more levels soon! I have also recommended this game to a few friends.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It was cracked  We wentl for vacation  I told my daughter to return this  but I think she forgot. Nevertheless she never used this
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|it's a fun game. wish the &quot;prices&quot; were more comparable to what you get and how long it takes to get it, but that's how they get you to spend real money.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I loved Gone Girl and so wanted to try one of the author's earlier books.  I was very disappointed in Sharp Objects.  It wasn't a thriller so much as just depressing.  I won't be reading any more of her older works.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Never watched this series, but now that I've started, can't stop!  Is interesting to see how young the characters were when the series began and how their characters have evolved.  Getting ready to start season 3!
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Biggest issue is with all the in app purchases that are needed in order to advance. Just too expensive for a free game.
B00FN811SY|5.0|The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses really showed me just how much they want me to understand The Bible. Not only do they release a simpler to understand version of the NWT Bible, but they made a app that allows one to fully explore that Bible. Then they a add 5 other Bible translations/versions that you can cross reference with ease. They do all this and then give it to us free of charge(It is noteworthy to mention that one could donate to the world wide education work that Jehovah's Witnesses are involved in, see jw.org for more details.<br /><br />I have been using this app the last week while I study and it has made me think more deeply about the scriptures. Also with the emphasis on keeping the New Deluxe NWT of the Holy Scriptures in dignified condition how convenient that we have an app that can take the brunt of the heavy onslaught of personal study that Jehovah's Witnesses are known for, thereby keeping my \\"hard copy\\" Bible in as pristine condition as possible.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Multiple and intuitive ways to navigate the books of The Bible.<br />Multiple translations that can be seen on the same page as the origin text.<br />footnotes and cross references that can be seen on the same page as the origin text.<br />Added features such as the glossary and full color appendices.<br />Clean uncluttered design that is easy to look at.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The only real cons for me are features that have been stated to be in the works.<br /><br />Coming Soon As (posted on jw.org)<br />Highlighting and notes: Highlight portions of the text and make notes as you study.<br />Additional publications: Read and study books, magazines, and brochures published by Jehovah's Witnesses.<br /><br />This app is a powerful study aide and is going to get even better as time goes by. I would recommend that anyone who fancies themselves students of The Bible download this app FREE of charge, today!
B009LDD22U|5.0|awesome show. I watch it over and over. everybody should see this show. I have every season on dvd and bluray.
1408803011|3.0|Since this is going to be the idea nugget for the next Harry Potter movie, I thought I'd check it out. It's an interesting bit of ephemera that Rowling used as a fundraiser for a charity. The best part is the interesting world-building at the beginning that quickly covers the history of the classification of magical creatures. When it devolves into descriptions of the many fantastic beasts, it becomes less engaging but still entertaining.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|My kids and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it to anyone who loves the classic Oz!  It is, of course, a wonderful movie for those who have never even watched the classic movie!  The actors did an excellent job, and the graphics are amazing!
1401232590|5.0|This is everything you could want in a modern Batman series. A series of self-contained stories that build to a larger arc that is greater than the sum of its parts. I didn't want to put it down and every time I picked it up, I read for longer than I had intended. I can see how this was inspirational to Nolan, and I think I prefer this book to those films.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN APPLE AND ITS LEADER THIS IS A GREAT BOOK.  MAKES FOR AN EXCELLENT GIFT.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This has been a great product and always will be.  No root needed and features can be learned easily for those that can actually pay attention.
B00E89VXQY|4.0|Very great album with clear and balance recording.<br />I prefer Live Shit but this is a very good one.<br />I have a problem with my copy: in Ride the lightning there are some sound distorsions ( from minute 1:39 to 1:52).<br />Anyone has this kind of problem?

B005LAIGYQ|4.0|\\"Act of Valor\\" is a modern-day war movie with a concept that every film producer thinks of, but few would really execute: a movie about soldiers played by real-life soldiers. Casting active-duty Navy SEALs to play themselves (as well as several professional actors including Roselyn Sanchez as supports), directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh have created an action film that is deeply flawed but still worth watching for its authentic combat scenes.<br /><br />The story goes like this. A Navy SEALs team led by Lieutenant Rorke (played by LCDR Rorke) is sent on a covert mission to rescue an abducted CIA agent (Roselyn Sanchez). In the course of accomplishing the mission they stumble upon a secret that involves an international smuggler and some packages.<br /><br />\\"Act of Valor\\" benefits from the great combat sequences that are intense and authentic, and the fine photography that helps raise the tension. I didn't find the acting that bad, probably because that's not what I expected from the beginning. (And I've seen worse acting by professional actors many times before, anyway.) The filmmakers know this is an action movie, and \\"Act of Valor\\" delivers.<br /><br />But I did find the script by Kurt Johnstad thin and clichéd, with too many expository dialogues and underwritten characters. The globe-trotting story that often lacks continuity is not only weak but slows down the pace of the film. All in all \\"Act of Valor\\" is not quite satisfactory, but as far as combat scenes go, the film is much above average.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|never has a show since the sopranos riveted me as this one has. Always a surprise and well written characters that you grow to love even though they are bad lol
B009A882D0|5.0|I'm giving this set five stars because I love Creedence, and the set has LOTS of really good (and great) stuff on it. (Yep, I'm giving it five stars despite the fact that I'm not really into \\"live\\" stuff! That's how terrific I think the selection of studio tracks is!) However, the vast majority of the studio tracks can be found on the Chronicle compilations. If you already have those collections (as I figure many if not most fans do), I really don't see much point in getting this set unless you just REALLY want the live recordings (or you're a Creedence collector).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so addictive but make sure it updates so you don't miss out on anything
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Matt Smith is amazing taking the character of Dr. Who. The cast of this series does a great job. The visual effects in certain cases are very 70's 80's but that is part of what is great of this series because they give you that nostalgic feeling.<br />Fighting all kind of enemies, like the Whispering Angels, Daleks, Cyberman and many other enemies/bad guys there is also a huge cast of allies that help the Dr save the worlds.<br />Thanks Amazon for having the series as part of your Prime subscription!!!

1936608898|5.0|They break everything down and make it easy to understand. Thought the program would be hard to do. But once I started the program, it was pretty easy to do. I'm no longer hungry between meals now.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|This is squarely in the young adult category and good from that perspective though it feels at times like there is an adult book waiting to break free. Gift it to your teens.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Several people walking down the aisle of the airplane asked me if this book was good and I had to tell you that this was a step down from his prior works.  If your a fan you will buy the book regardless of this or other reviews. But if you are picking up your first Gladwell book, I would suggest selecting \\"What the Dog Saw\\" rather than this one.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell covers the topic of how the weak overcome the strong and the fundamental weakness in strength.  Gladwell repeats his prior method of telling different stories to illustrate this point, starting with the titular David and Goliath and extending to the civil rights movement.  The approach is familiar, but insight is lacking as the author rehashes much of what we already know about how underdogs win over incredible odds.  He tries to bring a personal touch to the topic focusing each chapter around a person and a unique situation.  I found the books nine chapters somewhat distorted and while Gladwell tries to weave the pieces together he never quite accomplishes a narrative the way he has with his other books.  I think that the topic of weakness and strength is not strong enough for this type of treatment.<br /><br />There are a few conventional twisting parts that make the book worth reading, but not one to put at the top of your list.  Like all Gladwell books, he describes research performed by others, placing it in the context of the book.  The story of Caroline Sacks was illuminating in exploring the differences between being a small fish in a large pond or a large fish in a small one.  The story revolves around college choices and the impact of one great student joining other great students versus a great student going to a college where there are fewer other great students.<br /><br />Overall, this book is OK, particularly compared with Gladwell's other books, good just not great.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie, great actors, great lines, great everything. How could you go wrong with anything with Benedict Cumberbatch in it?

B00AEFY0F2|5.0|My mother has wanted a copy of Forrest Gump on DVD for ages, and finally fulfilled her wishes!  We rented this a few weeks ago, and it was the first time I ever saw the film.  Very heartwarming, entertaining, sometimes graphic( the Vietnam War scene) with a killer soundtrack of 1960s music to boot!  We like just about anything with Tom Hanks in it.  The special effects of dropping Forrest into situations with key historical figures is amazing for the time this was made(1994)!  This new copy looks to have a bigger/ better bonus features disk included.  I recommend it to anyone else who hasn't seen it yet!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I must be an old softy. I found this ending of this trilogy just too violent to completely enjoy. Yes, this is a morality play about the horror of violence and war. But, the cruelly inventive ways people were killed distracted me from the battle between right and wrong.. good and evil. In fact, the innocents end up in as much pain as \\"the bad guys\\".

B00F9040HU|5.0|This free version is a limited portion of the original game to give you the opportunity to play it and enjoy it. If you like the game you then have to pay money to get the remainder of the game which contains 76 levels.<br /><br />I own all of the Playrix games for the iPhone and the iPad. They are some of my favorite games and when I saw this game I just had to get it on my Kindle Fire. This is a match three game with some nice twists in the playing style. The animation and graphics are excellent. The faster you complete the level the more points you earn so watch the moving timer scale on the bottom of the game. You earn points but the goal is to free all of the puzzle pieces and collect the power ups and lives that help you defeat the game and beat the timer.<br /><br />The levels contains tiles they can also become single or double locked which means you have to match them two or three times to clear the locked tiles. Use all of the power tools wisely as you will need them in the harder levels. Some bottom tiles are also concrete so you have to play the game to move your pieces into the right positions to free them. Some levels you will not be able to beat unless you have saved adequate power tools!<br /><br />As you clear a level you journey through the ancient world collecting artifacts and earning more power up weapons and lives. Work the game to collect all of the puzzle pieces to finish the level and try not to leave any power up weapon trapped and left behind. Everyone is valuable and useful. You are on a quest to find the lost city of Atlantis.<br /><br />If you clear larger groups of tiles you can gain even more points at one time. Work hard to get matches of 5, 6 or more titles to get more points but remember to free all of the puzzle pieces and watch the timer. The graphics are outstanding and the sound track is nice also.<br /><br />The game is large in size as mine on the Kindle Fire is already 54.2 MB and it also stores your game data so the memory requirement will grow.<br /><br />The game does use the following permissions:<br />o Open network sockets<br />o Write to external storage<br />o Access information about Wi-Fi networks<br />o Access information about networks<br />o PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming<br /><br />This is a great game and I have to tell you that all of the Playrix games are 4 or 5 stars.

B00DC3DGSK|4.0|It's difficult to believe when listening to this two CD set that this talented artist has been doing the same astounding &#34;R & B&#34; routine for as many years as he has, and still sounds the same as he did when in the early 1970 while seeing him live in Blues / Juke Joints in Massachusetts .. The only thing missing from this performance is Junior Wells, they certainly made a great tem.<br />Buy this CD and enjoy the music of one of the legends in the Blues music industry.
B001XUYA0W|4.0|Mystic River is a great movie. Four friends grow up together however one of the friends experience traggety during their upbringing that four changed the friendship.  Great actors and suspenfull surprised ending.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first book starts out pretty interestingly, sort harlequin-romance style with a touch of soft-porn. The books become progressively more and more formulaic, and the ending is predictable, where the young heroine manages to save the older Mr. Grey from his tormented past. He buys a beautiful house for her, and they live happily ever after. Think &#34;Pretty Woman&#34;, and add a few whips and chains and anal plugs.
B00F9040HU|4.0|Very nice follow up for Call of Atlantis. Has it's own selection of aids to help get those pieces down to the bottom of the page.<br />It's another nice matching game.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very thought-provoking. It's an award-winner. I believe it's geared to the young adult market. Very similar to the movie. Some people have a problem with the ending. The book is very symbolic. You can pretty much interpret it any way you want. Personally, I loved both the book and the movie, although one could argue both the book & the movie are flawed.
159463176X|3.0|Best known for his first novel,  'The Kite Runner', this author certainly has, in spades, the wonderful gift of telling a story. A very powerful book that when published in 2003 introduced most of us, in a post 9/11 world, to Afghanistan, its people and cultures, and its recent conflicts. Since then two more books have been written by this author, of which this is one. There are many similarities with 'The Kite Runner' - after all why change a winning formula. All three books span at least one generation, Kabul is a major setting, the Taliban feature, the oppression of women, the divisions that exist between the rich and the poor, the weak and the powerful. And yet, for me, neither of the these later two books capture the brilliance, the richness, the raw emotion, the power of that first novel. There is no doubt they are terrific stories, with great characters, suspense, unexpected twists and surprises, but something is missing. I felt vaguely dissatisfied after reading 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' a few years ago, and it was the same with this book.<br /><br />Covering 60 years or so from 1952 to the present day, this is the story of family loyalty and love, beginning with an impoverished father coming to the inevitable conclusion that 'A finger had to be cut, to save the hand'. Abdullah and his younger sister, Pari, are the main focus of the early stages of the story, and then it moves to other characters whose lives are also affected by this decision. Staying mainly in Afghanistan, the story also goes to Paris, Greece, and San Francisco, as the years pass.<br /><br />There are a lot of minor characters who make a big impression at the time, that you think are going to be important to the overall story, but then just as suddenly  they disappear.  I spent a lot of time wondering what had happened to them, why they were even in the story in the first place, and will they appear some time before the end, to which the answer was no. I would love to have known what eventually happened to the young girl with the badly smashed face, or the two brothers who in one chapter were young boys living in a street in Kabul, then a chapter or two later were fully grown men living in San Francisco - how did that happen! Or a whole section of 40 odd pages back in rural Afghanistan, the central character a young boy, son of the local drug lord, who meets a homeless boy. You can see this could go somewhere, and just when it is getting interesting, whoosh, we are on some other tangent - a Greek Island in 1967.<br /><br />But despite the disjointedness, and the hopping around the decades, it is a great story, and very readable. From the very beginning, it is easy to care about the characters, to understand the motives behind the way they behave and to be happy with the eventual outcome. I did really enjoy it, my reservation being that maybe nothing this author writes will be as good as 'The Kite Runner'.
B009X2CUYA|5.0|Second of Kate Morton's books I have read (The Shifting Fog/The House at Riverton was the first). Great mystery that kept me guessing to the end. I loved the thought of the old castle with all the family secrets and ghosts. I like the way Morton writes, going back and forth in time, slowly revealing the full story in both timelines bit by bit. I can't wait to read her first book, The Forgotten Garden.

B007SGM084|5.0|Hmmmm ....I cannot wait for the movie! What a great story! Will be hoping for another series like this one!
B002RI8ZPK|3.0|A great detective novel, however the language is dated and a bit stereotypical and unrealistic.<br />Story is a little hard to follow at first, improves after a while.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it can't wait to start the next one. I love Sylvia day she has become one of my favorite writers
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It has been a long time since I enjoyed a book as much as this.  The characters have great depth and the story is thrilling.  Although placed in a fictional world, the story was not ridiculous because you can connect with the characters in one way or another.
B00F2P8ZDC|1.0|Firstly, anybody purchasing from the Amazon Instant Video, Stop right now it is not worth buy from ITUNES, because YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE MOVIE, UNLESS YOU HAVE A KINDLE FIRE. IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ANYTHING ELSE. Also, if you tried to watch it on your computer, it SUCKS!!! I said this because the quality is horrible and watching on 4g with full bars on my NEW SAMSUNG S4 phone or TOSHIBA laptop that does play HD movies and it still doesn't get better. Furthermore, it times out when I'm trying to watch it; then I have to wait for it to sync and process through in order to watch it. Oh, after it process through it times out again. SO, LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO RATE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH. ALTHOUGH, I LOVE THE MOVIE THE LITTLE MERMAID I definitely give that 5 to 10 stars, because I grew up on this movie. I DON'T WANT TO PURCHASE A KINDLE FIRE IN ORDER FOR NIECE OR NEPHEW TO WATCH A MOVIE JUST SO I CAN DOWNLOAD IT.<br /><br />AMAZON SO OF US ARE BROKE, Did you forget that Americans in a recession and that we have a government shutdown. You guys should make the video downloadable since people purchase it just like apple. You can hired IT specialist like me that actually know how to lock a movie that you can't share out to other. It calls using the account id and password in order to play the movie. For you guys to be tech savvy, you are really DUMB! Trying to watch it on a computer using wireless or dial up or anything is horrible. I hated it so much, I'm tempted to not buy anything that has to deal with movies from your company anymore unless it a dvd. Because you guys SUCKS when it comes to downloadable or instant watch!<br /><br />This is my opinion but I will tell it like it is.
0307271080|3.0|Initially, I was gripped by the story of young love between two teenage Nigerians.  They long for a different life away from the oppressive Nigeria military state of their time. Their focus on their new life abroad.  They both strive to excel academically intending to use their achievements to gain entry into either America or England and becoming successful entrepenuers.  The author is amazingly talented, and the first portion is exceptionally well-written, her prose is eloquent.  Unfortunately, the story dramatically shifts in focus once the lover's are in college.<br /><br />Eventually, Ifemelu decides she will go abroad and complete her education, while her love, Obinze will follow once he completes college in Nigeria. Their initial commitment and loyalty is strong despite their distance.  One day, desperation leads Ifemelu to make a decision that causes her great emotional pain and her shame causes her to temporarily cut ties with Obinze.  As time passes, she can not bring herself to reconnect with him and eventually their experiences and situations lead to very separate lives.<br /><br />Obinze eventually makes his way to England and struggles to gain legal status only to be denied at the last opportunity.  He is sent back to Nigeria where he must create a new life; which he does quite successfully but not without moral compromise.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ifemelu becomes involved in several relationships with several American men including White and African Americans. Her skilled writing results in great success as a much read and respected blogger on race.  As time passes, she concludes that she will never truly become viewed by others as a talented individual in the U.S., because in everyone's eyes, she is will always be seen as a African foreigner. She becomes increasingly outspoken and her editorial commentary becomes little more than ugly rants against all, who are non-African.  While she at times takes issue with African Americans (they aren't as aggressive in fighting racism as they should be and when they do take something to task, it isn't the correct battle to choose in her opinion), her derision is mainly directed at any one that is not of Africans descent, particularly whites.  What was once an empathetic character turns into a rage-filled woman, claiming she 'never experienced racism in Africa', only differences in social class.<br /><br />At first, I felt that I was gaining an appreciation of the immigrant experience.  Three of my grandparents were immigrants. Living in a multicultural community, I have several close friends with people of other races. I have dated people of all nationalities, including a number of whom were not born in the U.S.; I was even engaged to a person of another race and culture.  Years ago, I was a  member of an African American church (often the only white face on Sunday), where I heard quite an earful about how bad the white people are (some very justified).  Many of these people, I have shared a meal, views, laughter and tears as I sat in their homes and they in mine.  Yet, in several blogs she claims that no one, other than African immigrants \\"don't get it\\".<br /><br />Ifemelu claims that other immigrants be they yellow, brown, or red people, won't experience American racism like an African because they are higher on the social ladder - I am a skeptic on this claim -has Ifemelu been another race?  Those who have this complexion may strongly disagree with her perception.  I decided to discuss with with an Asian friend and she found that perception offensive.  I believe that no one can't truly understand anyone's struggle but their own; thus, there is no valid excuse to discredit others challenges.<br /><br />In fact, she is hypercritical of anyone non-African even if they are an immigrant.  Ifemelu's the diatribes of anger and rage that becomes increasingly more caustic and vituperative diminishes the value of the book and the story of the two separated lovers.  This segue is nearly half the book (250~ pages).  At times, it seems almost completely disconnected from the main story.  Ifemelu's negative comments which tend to be harsh even on African Americans.  Interestingly, one Nigerian reviewer states that he wasn't in agreement with some of her comments including that he felt some white people did get it.<br /><br />Eventually, Ifemelu returns to Africa and reconnects with the unhappily married Obinze and some of their peers. Many in the story, who sought their fortune in America or other nations return disenchanted and none seem genuinely happy about their life.  Life is far different than they expected (isn't this a universal truth for many adults versus youthful expectation - many people don't get the life they expected) not just expat Nigerians.<br /><br />While she seems dismiss the current Nigerian politics and the great frauds perpetrated by those in her peer group including Obinze; she remains hypercritical of America, believing that racism prevents a more equitable system.  I think class issues in America are more a are function of unemployment than race (which does play a part in the entire picture but is more about corporations sending jobs overseas and hiring illegals to work for below minimum wage).  In my humble opinion, the biggest issue is the difference between the haves and the have-nots is NOT solely racial matter.  Ifemelu lives in the U.S. for 15 years, I can not understand how she failed to observe economic matters, especially when many of her love interests are well off; perhaps, it is she is so obsessed with race herself.<br /><br />While, the beginning was fabulous, I felt misled into reading this is story \\"a dazzling new novel: a story of love and race centered around a young man and woman from Nigeria\\" and \\"Fearless, gripping, at once darkly funny and tender\\", instead it is immigrant's story turned into a lesson on how awful colonialism was and remains.  Their young love is tender but swiftly the novel transforms into an immigrant that believes any kindness shown her has a hidden agenda particularly if it is a white person, who is involved. Had the story line continued with initial plot instead of a morphing into a thinly veiled political discourse on racial prejudice particularly against black immigrants, I think the character would be much more empathetic to the reader.  However, she is histrionic, opinionated and demanding.  Who believes the world revolves around her.<br /><br />Much of life is of perception, while it is not politically correct to make comments about the handicapped, they are the often the brunt of jokes, ridicule and job discrimination.  Likewise, many in America have no shame in making comments about over-weight, ugly, and old people.  At the end of the day, we decide how we will respond to our particular struggles; we choose, how we let them impact us, as well as how we will choose to respond the next time it happens.<br /><br />This novel falls short of being funny or tender.  I was expecting a novel of first love and the challenges of an immigrant.  At 496 pages, this book was way to long and primarily racist discourse, yep, I am being \\"Politically Incorrect\\".  I can't help but wonder how much of this story is autobiographical.  If America is so appalling, I wonder the author chooses to live here and in Nigeria?  I read stories such as this was represented to gain insight into other's experiences, I didn't expect to be preached at because I will never \\"get it\\".  So, based on that perception, the character Ifemelu would claim I didn't get the book!  Though I have heard positive things about this author, this left a sour taste in my mouth.<br /><br />If you want to understand racism, I encourage you to read \\"Black Like Me\\" by John Howard Griffin or rent the movie adaptation by the same name, it is a true story of a white, Texas man, who intentionally took medication to turn himself black and went to live in the Deep South for one summer, so he couldunderstand the African American experience in the 1959 (published in 1960).
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Absolutely delightful book. I laughed out loud numerous times because I got caught unexpectedly with the humor. I enjoyed the back and forth of the story line. I definitely recommend it.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was surprising book.  Some secrets people have are so surprising, others seem to be mundane, yet we keep them close enough that they can all be hurtful to ourselves, to our identity, to others, when we finally reveal them.  Go ahead, read and find out the best kept secrets!

B00377V6J2|5.0|This DVD reveals an essential and little known facet of the biography of Stevie Ray Vaughan, the fact that when you're enjoying Stevie's dynamic bends and riffs, you're actually enjoying a style and technique that was taught to him and passed down to him by his teacher Albert King.. at one point in the video you actually get to witness Albert giving one last &#34;lesson&#34; to his protege.. This is a &#34;must see&#34; for any Stevie Ray Vaughan fan and a must have for any SRB fan's collection!!

B00AB55BS0|5.0|What can I say, amazing show. The box was a great deal. All the episodes on DVD/Blu-Ray and digital. The digital copy is what blew me away. I was able to download it through iTunes in full HD, something I did expect. Now I have all 10 episodes and bonus features on my computer and a hard disc copy as well. I let my friend borrow the DVDs while I watched it on my computer. Got him hooked on it too. Overall, great deal.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is very hard to put down. You just want to know what is next!  I loved the whole series!
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|I write my reviews with information I'd want if I were considering a purchase.  So here it is:  SB V was/is one of my favorite all-time prog rock CDs.  (saw them on the tour for V) I love The Kindness of Strangers and Beware of Darkness.  That was great stuff--genius prog-rock.  When Neal Morse left I lost interest in the band.  The first few CDs, Octane and Euphoria didn't do much for me.  X was much better.  But this this one is an even better triumph, a huge return to form for the band.  I miss the skillful drumming of NDV, but Keegan does the job.  Leonard was a huge pickup, as he writes well, sings well and really helps move the band along in new directions.  I got the CD 5 days ago and I've listened to it each day since.  Highlights are  'Afterthoughts', 'Something Very Strange', and 'Waiting for Me'.  It feels somewhat like a return to the Neal days but with the input of Leonard keeping things fresh.  Bottom line: If you like classic 'Neal Morse Beard', you'll like this CD.  Get the extended or full edition with the extra CD.  It is not just a throwaway, well worth the few extra bucks.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books. I could not put them down. I just keep reading them over and over. Very hot!!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Very good zombie flick that kept you at the edge of your seat and glued to the TV set. Brad did a realistic and good job acting; however, tender moment scenes with his on-screen wife did not seem real, almost like a brother and sister type relationship. Overall the movie is worth watching.
B009NY43NY|5.0|All of the Sookie books are wonderful.  If you watch the show and read the books you will get confused. Love the books!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the  best book of the hunger games trilogy. It is Suzanne Collins at her best! Along with Katniss you feel her sorrows and her joys. The hunger games is bigger, including president  snow and the capitol.<br />*spoiler alert*<br /><br />One of THE WORST THING  THAT EVER HAPPENS is that Prim DIES, and Katniss does not know  if Gale caused it or president snow. :(<br /><br />Thirteen's president, Alma Coin, is trying to kill her thru Peeta( explained below).<br /><br />Peeta is hijacked ( hijacked =  someone shows you a memory in video form [ in Peeta's case, of Katniss] and gives tracker jacket venom. Causes  you to think they are a mutt).
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put these books down. You feel like you are there.  A wonderful love story. Have read them over and over!
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I've been waiting for a book like this for many years.  There's been a few books that go into various aspects of the future we're building for ourselves, but they focus mainly on the how and what--not the why.  The Circle gets into not only the philosophy of the surveillance state but some of the earlier values that must be accepted before you arrive at the conclusion that this would be a good idea.<br /><br />While thematically it's fair to compare this to 1984, from an execution standpoint it's not in that class.  However, it's still a very good novel and one I really enjoyed.<br /><br />I think the novel was successful in showing Mae's transformation, even if at times the moments of change were a little too fast and easy for me.  I thought the character development was solid and there was a good collection of periphery characters, none of whom felt superfluous to the theme.<br /><br />I'll admit at the beginning I wasn't sure if this was going in the direction of 1984 or Office Space, with the Orientation and early weeks of Mae's employment.  In hindsight, I do think that that uncertainty wasn't necessarily a bad thing because it draws in readers familiar with that world, those activities, and that mentality, which is really necessary to get you questioning what the hell you're really doing online by the end of the book.<br /><br />Other that a few quibbles with Mae's development that I mentioned, I didn't have many complaints with how the story was told.  I felt the sex-scenes were a little cringe-worthy at times and I never really understood Mae's connection to Francis in terms of their romantic relationship.  I would have liked Mae to been a little different at different points, but my frustration with her impulsivity was consistent with the character so I guess I can't fault Eggers there.<br /><br />One small formatting issue: I don't know if this was just with the Kindle version, but since there were no chapter breaks the story was a little jarring when it jumped around at times where the spacing wasn't indicating a scene shift.<br /><br />I think Eggers has written an important book with The Circle.  The aquarium scene as a metaphor for online communities and social media convergence was worth the price of admission alone.umped around at times where the spacing wasn't indicating a scene shift.<br /><br />I think Eggers has written an important book with The Circle.

B004I9CXHW|1.0|Tried using this with an iPhone, thinking I could plug my USB cable into the USB AMI plug...no dice. Nothing. Wasted my money. Don't waste yours.
0385351399|2.0|This book feels like a put-on, like 50 Shades of Gray. The concept for the story is good, very topical, very compelling, but the writing is shockingly bad. I mean -- huh? It's very puzzlingly bad, almost as if the author outsourced this project to a teenage kid with no writing talent. It's not written in first-person so I don't know why it's so dumbed-down. Is it an ill-advised affectation or is he aiming it at 10-year-olds or is he just really busy these days and dialing it in? Zeitoun was well-written so I'm just very confused by the subpar writing in The Circle (not the story, though, which IS of interest and I'm sure will make a good film).
0385342071|5.0|I grabbed this on a whim at the library, and I wasn't really expecting to finish it because it's a much larger book than what I usually read. In fact, I didn't even open it for a few days. But once I did, I couldn't put it down! I'm actually very sad that it's over. Not because the ending sucked, because it didn't. I was very satisfied with the end; Kinsella didn't leave any strings untied. But I'm sad because I loved the book so much I didn't want it to end. I wish it could just keep going forever. But, all good books must end eventually, right?<br />I love the way Kinsella writes. I don't know what it is, exactly, but something about her writing just sucks me into the book completely by the beginning sentence all the way until the end. And it's quite rare that a book can do that to me. I was even interested in all the business scandals and whatnot throughout this book, which is VERY rare. Usually I zone out when I hear anything having to do with business and stuffy men in suits, but this one held my interest.<br />I'm definitely going to be picking up some of Kinsella's other books at the library (just as soon as I finish reading Confessions of a Shopaholic!), hopefully the others will be as good as this one.<br /><br />Long, rambly story short: Read this book. I'm sure you'll love it.

B00AFROVQC|4.0|An easy read without much complexity and obvious themes.  Entertaining, but not of the level of Martin, Tolkien, or Rowling.
B005LAJ16I|3.0|Very well scripted.  Keeps you thinking and swinging between traitor or not.  We could not wait to get on to the next episode.<br /><br />The format for playing specific episodes is not as intuitive as other TV shows I have seen.

B009IJJ8UM|5.0|I hadn't heard anything about this series before finding it as a suggestion from Amazon. I already liked the cast, but I'm also fairly picky when it comes to crime dramas. The CSI type show has really ruined crime drama for me. I started looking at reviews however and quickly became intrigued.<br /><br />There's a comic from xkcd that really sums it up ([...]<br />5 stars and it only has 1 review.<br />4 1/2 stars, it's fantastic<br />Anything less is more often than not crap.<br /><br />This series had close to 1000 reviews when I'm writing this, and 4 1/2 stars. The odds that this was an incredible series were very high.<br /><br />I took the plunge. Bought the first season and subscribed to the 2nd...<br /><br />I'm SO glad I did. The cast is incredible. The writing is great. The dynamic between Miller and Lu is awesome. Holmes is a quirky character to be sure, but still human. The supporting characters and cast are not done in an over the top way. It really comes across as honest.<br /><br />I've always liked Sherlock Holmes but not been obsessed with the character. Is this true to SACD's writings? No, of course not. Nothing written in this day an age would have the same perspective as from his day. Is the modern reinvention worth purchasing? Absolutely. The reviews are right on, and unless you're a die-hard Holmes fan and purist, you're bound to love this series.

B001NHNG64|4.0|The movie, which I didn't see, and several recommendations from acquaintances got me reading Lee Child's books. Glad I didn't see the movie, how could Tom Cruise play a 6'5&#34;, 220 lb marine.  Wanted to say ex, but once a marine, always a marine and that's what Jack Reacher is.  Enjoyed the first book immensely and likewise for the second one.  Child really gets into relating the ballistics, etc. of various weapons, trajectories for long range shots and does a fantastic job of it.  Looking forward to the third book which I will start this week!  An excellent read!

B00D1VKZ3M|3.0|I didn't believe a word in this book. Not much stuff made a sense. Even the diary format didn't make a sense. It feels like, that author just couldn't be bothered. Sometimes less is more. This book is not very original. If you liked Bridget Jones 1, then you gonna love The Not So Secret Emails Of Coco Pinchard, she is much stronger/better character and the book is so much fun, very clever, like Bridget used to be. I always will enjoy going back to first Bridget book, but this one never again. Waste of money.

The objects on the pedestals are even harder to see because they blend in with the background. I found the zoom feature after a few rounds and this game needs it! I almost gave it a 1 star poor review until i found the zoom.<br /><br />If the devs fix the things i mentioned above, this would be a very good hidden object game.
142311339X|5.0|my grandson asked me about any books that I had been reading. I told him about this series and he seemed interested. So when I ordered it, I thought. Maybe it will come, maybe not but at least I made an effort to find it. It was offered at a very good price, and amazingly enough in this day and age, here it comes quickly to my mailbox. Thank you !
B006LMMN8I|5.0|This album is incredible, from front to back. Unique and original, Be Good is made with the classic Jazz elements that we've drifted away from. The lyrics, vocals, and instrumentation mesh together very well.  This album is undoubtedly a timeless effort that you can listen for the rest of your life. I'd rate more than half of the songs a perfect 5/5 and the rest come close avging about 4.6-4.8/5. Do yourself a favor and buy this project!
B008JFUO72|5.0|I really enjoy this series and anticipate the new one coming out. I do not go to movies in the theater because I live so far from a movie house. Many times I cannot even find the DVD option. Thank you ! Right on time.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Lovely story of overcoming prejudices. Happy tears and sad tears flow through the story. Middle schoolers, their parents, and their teachers would do well to read this book.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I didn't know there was a third movie in this series ! I live in a very rural area and it is hard to keep up on movies. I appreciated having this offered in recommendations for me. Good price. Came very quickly !
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|This application is simply lacking. Even tho you pay for it you find advertising inside. Can't comment on the accuracy of weather forecast.
1455527475|3.0|First up, books like this are important. We need more insiders to come out and tell those of us on the outside what happened internally and why the markets crashed. We do need courageous people like this to speak out and explain to those of us deeply affected by the decisions of the elite few, exactly what happened and exactly how they managed to tank the markets and the economy in 2008. Also, they need to explain why we are still poised on the brink (with sovereign debt in the US and Europe still a major concern). So I commend Mr. Smith for his courage in coming out and sharing his experiences with the world.<br /><br />Second, he does give an interesting perspective on how Goldman Sachs changed from an investment bank into a hedge fund and how they shifted their strategy from caring about the customer to caring about their own margins. He outlines the difference between the way clients were treated after 9/11 and the 2008 meltdown.  He argues that after 9/11 Goldman Sachs was willing to take the hits to their own profit margin and cared more about the client than their own P/L statement, whereas after the 2008 meltdown senior people at GS were only concerned about their P/L and were willing to sacrifice relationships and reputation to protect their margins. He also discusses in summary the many difficulties with the highly complex derivative products that were sold to clients without the clients fully understanding the products.  He also argues that there were certain gullible customers that Goldman targeted and (by implication) preyed upon to boost their own revenues even though they knew that some of the products were not good for the client.<br /><br />These behaviors do need to be exposed and I do commend Mr. Smith on having the courage to do this.  I am sure that writing this book (and the original editorial) must have been difficult for Mr. Smith and I am sure he burned many bridges and compromised many relationships by trying to bring out the truth of what was behind the strategies that effected the world economy in such a drastic way. That said, I do have some issues with the book and things Mr. Smith writes about.<br /><br />While I do think books like this do need to written, they need to be analytical and rigorous and spend time explaining to people exactly what caused the meltdown and exactly what was going on. Mr. Smith does do this to some degree but wastes a lot of time and space on inane, mind numbing details that don't really contribute to the conversation at all. I mean is the canteen crisis in the new Goldman building really adding to the conversation? Does a description of the banning of all participation from the Goldman gym really need to be told (apart from telling us that these are entitled, spoiled grown ups).  Do we really need to know that when he had certain important conversations he was standing behind a urinal? These types of inane subjects just seem to be space fillers and do not contribute much to the conversation of the financial crisis and the moral bankruptcy of the investment bank culture.<br /><br />Also, Mr. Smith's own self promotion seems to be at odds with the humility he is trying to project: I was the best table tennis player, I only ever made one mistake on the futures desk, I started to write summaries and was highly commended for them. Stuff like this seems to be self serving and self promoting in some ways and is a display of false humility (intended or not). I have no doubt that Mr. Smith is a smart man. I have no doubt he worked hard and the success that followed him was in no doubt because of his hard work and determination, but this type of self promotion is completely unnecessary. Also, his complete sense of privilege is also shown by his \\"subway stories.\\" He lived an entitled, privileged life and yet seemed to think taking the subway was a sacrifice rather than the day-to-day existence of most normal people.<br /><br />The other disturbing feature about the book is how hewas only concerned about HIS career, HIS future, HIS finances and HIS family during the crisis. I must say this is very honest, but very disturbing. I personally knew many people outside the finance sector who had nothing to do with investment banking who showed more care and concern for the long term effects this crisis was going to have on everyone, and did not think only about their own well being. Mr. Smith earning upward of USD200k a year from his early twenties should have worked harder at securing his financial future through saving and living a more normal life.<br /><br />The last area that really disturbed me about the book was that Mr. Smith tries to come across as an innocent victim in the whole financial collapse. He comes across as someone completely ignorant of what was going on and tries to present himself as a wide eyed innocent, but I simply reject this. Yes, I know he cannot be guilty by association with those who did tank the market and those who did design dangerous derivative products, but I cannot believe he was completely surprised by the collapse. Once again I personally knew a few people in corporate finance that were predicting the meltdown and there were many others who were predicting the sub-prime mortgage crisis before the meltdown happened. Did Mr. Smith really have his head so deep in the sand that he could not see the impending crisis?<br /><br />All in all this long, protracted resignation letter is an interesting read, but not a compelling one. I do commend Mr. Smith for taking the time to do it but I do hope further efforts will be more revealing, perhaps something along the lines of Andrew Sheng's \\"[[ASIN:0521134153 From Asian to Global Financial Crisis]]\\".  I am sure Mr. Smith will find a new and prosperous career somewhere on Wall Street and I do wish him well in the future, but I did find his long resignation letter a little too self serving and tedious.was only concerned about HIS career, HIS future, HIS finances and HIS family during the crisis.

B00846F1YW|5.0|Game is very addicting when you start you don't want to put it down.<br /><br />Easy to play but also challenging and keeps you on your toes.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I was playing this and showed my adult daughter.  Mistake because I did not get it back until she had completed all levels.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is so amazing and addictive I play it like all day long and its just barrels o' fun
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great follow-up to the story of Danny Torrance. It was like reading a favorite book again for the first time
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This is probably one of the top animated films for this year.  Very kid friendly and honestly very enjoyable for adults.  highly recommmend it.
B008US4PBY|3.0|So I just received my Cronus today and so far I've been faced with an \\"E\\" error code.<br /><br />I'm using the Silver Xbox 360 play and charge controller on the PS3 with no luck thus far.<br /><br />Anyone know if there is any update that needs to take place in order for the controller to function<br />properly?<br /><br />At this point I'm a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Please if anyone has any advice to give so I can get the Cronus up and running,<br />I would be eternally grateful as I can't stand the PS3 controller and have wanted to start racing<br />on GTA V for some days now with the XB Controller.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have evernote on my iphone, macbook and iMac.  I think it is easier to use than the clip function that comes with the mac.  It is very easy to use and talks to all of my devices easily.  It is easy to save a portion of a web page or the entire page and then save it or send it to a friend.
B00E63OMEM|5.0|A really good read if you are an Adventure Time fan. This is a really fun book, I recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another home run by Mr. King! Not that I'm surprised, of course. I never expect anything he has written to be bad, so I knew I would enjoy this book. Although, I have to admit, I was dismayed when I found out it was about vampires. I mean, vampires? Been there, read that, right? Well, I'll admit I've probably not read every vampire book out there, but I've never read about vampires like these. They were unique and evil and I loved it!<br /><br />I think the best part of the book was Dan and Abra, though. Dan, because it was nice to catch up with him and see what he's been up to since everything at The Outlook. And to watch him struggle and grow as a person. It was all I could have asked for and more! And Abra was a perfect complement to Dan's Shine. Smart in the way that a child who knows too much too early would be smart. But she handles everything amazingly well, because what else can you do when that is your life, but get through it?<br /><br />This book sucked me in and wouldn't let me go! Just like Tbe Shining did at the end. I don't know what it is with these books, but I get this feeling like the fate of the characters depends on my being there to read! I can't recall ever getting that feeling with any other book before.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to fans of The Shining. It is a fantastic follow-up!
B00F5F0208|5.0|Awesome work from Drake. The longest intro though but overall this is an album we have been playing daily from start to finish.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Google has done a really good job with Chromecast.  It's relatively easy to install and use.  Navigating on a tablet or a smartphone is much more enjoyable and efficient than using a remote.  There are limited options to get content but it looks like Google is working to fix that with addition of Hulu+ and others.  It is more of an addition to your existing TV service than a replacement.  If it could replace my existing service that would get a great rating!
B00F875N98|5.0|Having seen them in Chicago at the House of Blues, I remembered I didn't have this album when it first came out.  Hearing them perform some of the songs live, made me run home and buy this CD immediately.  It's astounding.  SO much talent here with these guys.  If you are a fan: you will love it.  If you are not a fan, get the cd and listen to it.  It's that good.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Fist book I read from this author. He has wry sense o humor and waste no words. A very good read.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Hearing the few singles on the radio made me interested in this CD. Seeing him perform on awards shows got me even more intrigued.  He and I share the same day of birth (minus the year, mine was 670BC), so I had to have it.  Price is always nice on Amazon.com.  I am so glad I bought this album.  Macklemore is a very talented, socially-conscious rapper who brings a breath of fresh air into a seemingly stagnant genre.  I have this on repeat at home and in the car.  Well done.  Go get it.  Download it.  Play it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is fantastic!!!!!  It's a lot like subway surfers (if you've ever played that), but with super funny minions instead.  I would totally recommend getting this game!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was hesitant to download this because of the mixed reviews but it was free and Amazon was offering 20 coins for the purchase, so I figured I really didn't have much to lose. Downloaded this to my Kindle Fire HD with no problems (I see that other reviewers did not have the same experience, so hit or miss I guess). I love escape type games and for me this was not very challenging but I still enjoyed it very much. It is true that starting the game, there is little to go on, but I have played enough of these that by tapping around, I was able to come up with the solutions. I was only stuck on one code on level 7 but watched a YouTube cheat for it and easily finished. I would prefer this to have been longer, because I enjoy these type games. Ten levels is a little short, but hey, it is free, I'm not going to complain too much. The only other thing is that (as other reviewers mentioned) if you leave the game (or even a puzzle within the level at times) it resets and you have to start from scratch on that level (or puzzle). Though the puzzles were not so challenging as to make this frustrating, it did get a little tiresome at times, so I docked a star for that. Overall, I would play more games like this, or additional levels if they are offered and for now it is part of Amazon's 20 coins promotion, so this seemed like a win/win to me.
B0089LT8Y6|4.0|I have always been a Testament fan ever since getting into thrash metal. I everything they released in the 80s and many albums after those. I even have said many times that they need to take Anthrax's place in the Big Four as I see them as a far better metal band. So did I like \\"Dark Roots Of Earth\\" album? Absolutely. Every but of it is fast, rocking and certainly has a true Testament-vibe to it. Songs such as \\"True American Hate\\" and \\"Man Kills Mankind\\" I find myself re-playing quite often. It is a solid release of theirs and does not disappoint. But I must say I think it falls a little short of it's great predecessor \\"The Formation Of Damnation\\" which set the standards for me that I had for this album. The production is top-notch (thanks to Nuclear Blast who do a terrific job at producing albums) but I think that surpasses the bands playing. The songs on here, are simple, almost radio-friendly songs that don't hit the listener so hard as other Testament albums do. It lacks some of the aggression of previous releases and is the reason this album bores me JUST a little! But that is only how I feel about it compared to what I was expecting of it. Overall this is a a very good Testament album that gives the listener that feel-good feeling that many of their albums do and is worthy of being in my collection. And yes, I am looking forward to buying their live \\"Dark Roots Of Thrash\\" CD/DVD this month. I saw them on that tour, by the way....my second time seeing them!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Good book easy read makes me want to buy emergency supplies. I like all different perspectives from around the globe.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|When I saw the movie, I thought it was great and thought provoking but the soundtrack really grabbed me, especially the closing credits song.  I highly recommend this CD!
B007QUUJMG|5.0|Is not the kind of book i usually read but im sure glad i did.... Loved this book so much
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I had never read anything by this author. The story is very entertaining and there is a surprise ending at the end.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It took me on a fantastical journey where I could see, hear, feel, smell and taste everything described.  I was a bit confused in the beginning with the jumps in time and descriptions but once I got used to the way the book was laid out it wasn't a problem.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|As time goes on it becomes faster and more difficult. Obviously. I find myself coming back to this game time after time. Great game to pass the minutes. Enjoy it, great with sound on!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great puzzle game! Relaxing without being boring and just hard enough to keep you interested. Wish it was longer! Took me about an hour to complete. Highly recommend you give it a try!
B00EQRMAJW|4.0|Another good one by John Legend. Cannot go wrong with his albums. Great to get you in the mood with your woman.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|It is not your actual stature, but how you are perceived that makes a man. Tom Cruise did an amazing job portraying a larger than life figure. Hope there are more to come
B008Y212PI|4.0|Like the three different levels to play.  Allows for anyone yo play and work their way up to the higher levels.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Even law enforcement agents are not above the law, although their brethren find it hard to believe and band together to protect the guilty. Eventually, they all get caught and get what they deserve.
B001VFTYW8|5.0|I enjoy books that transport me to their location.  That is why I read,  all of these that I have read have been fun reads.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I actually prefer this one to the first reboot. Not going to lie, as a hard core Trekie I have issues with it (entirely nit-picky and crazy/obsessive issues). But still overall, great movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing evernight. Fun and easy to play. My children also enjoy the games.thank you for all the fun.
0099579944|5.0|This book is an excellent end to an amazing set!  Ana and Christian go through the most trying events! I would absolutely recommend this book!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Rented this movie on amazon prime. Great picture quality and very entertaining movie! Star Trek Into Darkness is a great Sci Fi movie perfect for a rainy day!
B00992CF6W|5.0|you shouldn't have to get mobs to get new animals.but over all I'm a minecraft freak!!!!I even have it on the xbox
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I've been using this app for years. I absolutely love it! The updated version is nice as well. I don't know what I'd do without it. I have it on my kindle and my phone so I can always access it
B0033TJATW|5.0|I order this for my five year old who is becoming a Michael Jackson fan. I was worried that it would be a bad copy because so many people had negative responses. However, we just watched it and it was a clear clean DVD and it was in English which was another concern. The company shipped it to me way before I expected it.  I am very pleased. If I was supposed to review the movie itself then I say only watch or buy it if you are a Michael Jackson fan because the movie itself didn't make sense, but the music and dancing was worth the buy to make my son happy!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I think this book reminds you why history is important to learn and study. Those that ignore it are destined to repeat it. Beautiful book and an easy read.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|TRhis book held my interest from beginning to end. I was unable to figure out the relationship between characters until the end , where they were all tied together. What a great story. A must read for everyone.
030758836X|3.0|Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl explodes with expert pacing.  The author instantly hooks you in, developing the primary characters and their troubled relationship.  Every note rings true.  Using first person narration from both perspectives, we’re ushered into the inner lives of Nick and Amy Dunne.  The mystery ignites when Amy goes missing and chilling clues suggest she met a violent fate.  Suspects are seamlessly introduced and the stakes get higher and higher when all signs begin pointing to Nick as the culprit.  It’s intense and gripping.<br /><br />But then, after a couple hundred pages, there’s The Reveal…<br /><br />To say things go off the rails would be an understatement; things go off the rails, fall off a cliff, collide with a nuclear power plant, and spur an unsolvable catastrophe as fallout douses the reader thirty miles downwind.<br /><br />As a reviewer, I can’t spoil any surprises, so I’ll tread lightly.  But in order for this character to have coordinated everything he or she planned would require such diabolical cunning, that it strains credulity.  This character (whoever he or she may be) would have to be Hannibal Lecter meets Emperor Palpatine meets the entire cast of Ocean’s Eleven poured into one cranium.  Laughably outlandish.<br /><br />There’s intricate plotting and then there’s Rube Goldberg plotting.  This is Rube Goldberg plotting.<br /><br />I can’t not recommend the novel though.  It’s a page turner, big time.  It beats a four hour marathon of Honey Boo Boo by a long shot.  With so many soporific books in the marketplace, Gone Girl is a refreshing, deep, and exciting indulgence.  But very, very far-fetched.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN!! You have to really use your brain to figure out how to escape. I will recommend this to my friends!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|the first day I downloaded it set it up I listened to it and slept like a baby. very soothing and multiple sounds and options
B007PVHANM|4.0|beautifull person, much more than I thought...and already like him...which to Know much more from him...only looking him you feel e very thing is true...
0316017922|5.0|Easy to read, insightful, and very very interesting!<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell is a master of his craft! He methodically breaks down topics into meaningful insights and observations that even if you choose not to agree with, will teach you to think differently about life.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading his other works.
B002M9WW30|5.0|The best of the best. I Love It.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I logged out of my account and then I tried to log back in, but it keeps loading and loading and loading and then it says that it's taking longer than it should and tells me to try again in a bit...I've tried over 20 times.

B005XN31LY|5.0|I bought the pilot for a viewing one night for new watchers of the series. It gives you the background and sparks the obsession!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this but if you beat the game in a day then it gets boring. This game is a good time consumer.
B005AV93JI|4.0|Brilliant book! Needed it as a part of my university course; it is an exhilarating read. a must or all adventure junkies out there!
B000JCSPG0|5.0|wow, 2nd time of seen it and it gets better every time, looking forward to watching more movies, and ordering some

B00594XOZU|1.0|It use to be a great app but now i cant log in anymore and it's been like this for quite a time. I'm getting frustrated every time i try to log in it loads for like five minutes and then it say to try again later.  I even tried creating a new account nothing works.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Something is wrong with you if you don't like this game so yeah if you buy it's like buying minecraft(recommended) you won't regret it so yeah..........lol
B003WTE886|5.0|Opened the package and the Cd had huge cracks on the case on front and back a little disappointing. CD was still in perfect conditon thankfully.
B004GYY714|1.0|I've used TuneIn for years on a multitude of devices but when installed on the Fire HDX it just doesn't run. The streams cut out every ten seconds or so making it impossible to listen to. It makes no difference which stream is selected, I tried 30 different ones from music to talk stations &amp; increased the buffer to 60 seconds with no improvement.  It's not a network issue since TuneIn works fine on my older Fire as well as my iPhone and Sonos system all of which are on the same LAN. Also other streaming services work fine on the HDX so I can only assume that the Fire HDX is the issue. I'd stay away from this until they fix the problem.
3795753384|5.0|Great stuff to handle and use in chorale singing. The music and text are both very clear and readable.  Great.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Overall this was a good book and I liked it.  There was nothing groundbreaking done, and the plot wasn't spectacular.  If you're looking for a good, basic book - then give this one a try.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I Can't get enough of it and am so anxiously waiting for season 4 to start here in the States.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|I don't know why I like this movie, but I do. Silly, stupid, ridiculous, no plot, insane,..........but I loved it.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Any fan of '80s Rock will love this movie. Never particularly liked Tom Cruise but he really turns it in as Stacy Jaxx!
B0036EH3TS|5.0|Fantastical story, but who knows........I understand they did land a probe on an asteroid not too long ago.  Anyway, this is action packed from beginning to end.  If you weren't aware, Charlton Heston gave the opening introduction to this movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The view point of this book is what made me think.  Good read, sad but so many times they characters made me laugh.
B007P7UF06|5.0|Amazing costumes, sets, scenery.......... and a grand musical. When Hollywood make big productions and had unlimited budgets.<br />A must have movie if you're in love with movies made in &#34;back in the day&#34;.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I so wanted the husband to pay for his crime and I hated how he turned it into his wife's nightmare to endure.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Ridiculous sets, impossible storylines..........but somehow, this show captured the minds of my generation and it became a cult thing.<br />It never died and still is being shown in re-runs to this day.  For it's time, it was fun to watch and dream of talking computers, communicators, tricorders, phasers  warp speed, and aliens.  Today, we have talking computers, cell phones, and even medical devices that can scan us.  We probably have phasers in development via the military.  Who know's what's next..........beam me up Scotty
1401917232|5.0|So, while reading this book, i could see my ego disolve right in front of my eyes. its still there, but i feel guided by the Holy Spirit more. This book LHFNO is guided by the Holy Spirit, more than the bible or any other spiritual book out there. LHFNO is a God send.<br />I love Arten, Pursah and Gary, and even though i haven't met them i feel so much adoration and love for them. So, read this book even if you aren't into \\"spirituality\\" because of the characters.<br />While reading this book I observed warm tingly sensations throughout my body while reading chapter 2. i think that is the Holy Spiit at work. If you read this book you may exprience the HS more intimately than ever before. God is working through these messages of Gary.<br />I also noticed my peceptions of the Holy Spirit change, and thus creating a better relationship with It. In LHFNO Gary references a conversation he had with someone at his workshop. He says you will learn to trust the Holy Spirit. Upon reading that, i did not feel like I trusted the HS, and i noticed it is because i blame God for my pain. But according to ACIM and the D.U.series only God exists, therefore i gave up my resentment towards God! Aw its wonderful. And now i feel more open to communicating to God.<br />And i loved Gary's prayer for healing. I am going to try that. And i loved Arten and Pursahs tips for health. I am not going to mention them because i don't want to ruin it for others, but i liked it.<br />I do have to say i want to hear more about Gary and Cindys relationship. What was it like meeting someone you had great connections with in previous lifetimes, in this lifetime!?. describe it please. But, everything happens for a reason i guess.<br />Anyway, i loved the book. i read it in like a day and a half ;)<br />Thanks Gary :)<br />Oh, and come to Pennsylvania so i can see you!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|3 of the best movies ever made. Story, actors, direction, sets, costumes....... A masterpiece and timeless from generation to generation.
0316228583|3.0|I have to agree with some of the worst reviews and with some of the best reviews.  This is a mixed bag of a read.  It's extremely difficult to like any of the major characters - we may feel sorry for them, but we do not like them.  A social conscience is never a bad thing, but it needs a deft hand if the writing isn't to slip into diatribe and melodrama.  The author is not always successful.  I'm afraid I had to force myself to finish.  There's no need for the length of this book.  Tighter writing would have enhanced the read.  The ending of the book and the attempts to wrap up all the various plotlines, leaves one with little hope and with very little sense of redemption.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|One of Heston's finest movies.  You wont see it on TV, because the main stream media wouldn't like Christians killing of Muslims.......all that PC crapola these days.  But this is based on what is said to have been actual events.  How can you not like a movie with Heston and Sophia Loren.  Filmed on location in Spain........just breathtaking. A must have in your collection.

B009A87ZKG|5.0|It really doesn't get any better than this one, for realism, casting, set, costumes, scenery..........and all based on a true story.  I can see why Scott won Best Actor and the film won BEST MOVIE.  Epic movie in all aspects.  Every person should watch this movie...... to see what the troops of England and the USA went through during WWII.  My father fought in the Ardens during the Battle of the Bulge and he said the scene when Patton was marching up to get the 101st, with the heavy snow in the trees and the 88's blasting the tops of the trees off, took him right back to the heavy fighting where he was severely wounded. It was that realistic.
B00EDX5QNG|1.0|This album is wonderful and was able to hear it on npr before buying it&#62; My issue is that I thought amazon was going to send the digital file along with the album because they did it with the last cd I bought and I was quite impressed.  I am not quite sure why they do it with some cds and not others.
B007N3206E|5.0|What a movie..........What a cast............What a story.  Has it all and then some.  A must have for every serious movie collector. It doesn't get any better than this.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I enjoyed the book. The author did a great job of keeping you wanting more. I look forward to reading the next book.
B005XT10YS|4.0|Like most Robert Redford films, this movie about the trial of Lincoln's assassination conspirators is historically meticulous and dramatically rich, but also slow-moving and frequently under-played in key moments. In the extra features, Redford said he was going for a deliberately musty look to the sets, unfortunately resulting in an &#34;Antiques Roadshow&#34; vibe that weighs the film down like a lead ball while leaching the visceral impact of every scene. But the film is certainly well-cast with many familiar TV and cinema faces. James McAvoy is good as the idealistic young lawyer assigned to defend Mary Surratt, a Southern Catholic widow who ran the boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and friends planned the death of Abraham Lincoln, leaving herself as the only female conspirator charged in military court with treason. Redford analogizes the post-assassination backlash of 1865 to present-day abuse of civil liberties. Rather than taking sides for or against Surratt, played here with iron resolve by Robin Wright Penn, Redford lets her remain distant, trying to suggest her guilt and innocence simultaneously. Ironically, the greater historicity here means weakened drama, for which Redford relies on Kevin Kline in a clearly villainous role as War Secretary Edwin Stanton. It creates a weird sense of disconnect to see Stanton consistently played as a villain while Surratt is played as an enigma rather than hero. It's a good film, but not great. Daniel Day-Lewis probably did a better job in &#34;Lincoln&#34; because of his efforts to provide insights into Lincoln's character. This film refuses to give us real insight into anyone except McAvoy, whose gradual transformation comes across here as a touch more self-righteous than genuine. The film should have been about the titular Mary Surratt, not her lawyer.

B00CL8D83U|4.0|This album was the best I could have expected from the Pet Shop boys, I was entirely amazed at its earlier 80 s day feel. I will say this, the pet shop boys have come full circle in music and possibly a life situation.  WOW!  You have taken me back to 1985!  This is the best 49th birthday gift I could have ever received.
B00BEEC6L2|4.0|Judge Dredd is a classic comic series, and I'm glad to find them available for Kindle. The only complaint I have, which was the only thing that prevented a full 5-star rating is the awkwardness in reading it. the side-to-side flip from one frame to the next is convenient once you figure it out, but it's still a bit small on the iPhone, which is especially disappointing considering that it doesn't fully utilize the screen space it has available to it, or the iPhone's natural zoom capability. However, while this setback prevents this ebook from full 5-star glory, it is still plenty workable and functional on the iPhone's small screen, plus the story [so far] is great. Would definitely recommend to the Dredd fan, or someone new to the series who is interested in checking it out.

B00DJUPLY8|5.0|Playing audio and video shouldn't be hard, you shouldn't have to worry about codecs, and it should all be done from one program you say? Here's your answer! After trying several other programs and not finding something that lived up to that ideal, I finally found it here. A minimum of fuss, a maximum of usability.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I like the sleep timer on it. Great sounds, and nice that you can easily create your own custom mix of sounds. I wish you could dim the night clock, though. My favorite of all the wrote noise apps I've tried.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire. I take my android phone everywhere with me but not always the Kindle Fire because of size issues, where I am going or just because it is one more thing to be carrying. The Kindle for android allows me to continue reading my current Kindle material. Usually it comes in handy to pass time when I have to unexpectedly wait for something and I don't have my Kindle Fire with me. The fact that it was free was also very nice.<br />The only criticism I have is not the application's fault but just that the screen on my phone is so small. Otherwise, I think that it is great.

B00340ESIS|2.0|The autor makes many good points, like the concept of using pin board for initial layout or his Beat Sheet to quickly review your script. Most of the advices, however, are something you tottaly want to avoid in 2013! Look up what movies the author is credited with, on IMDB.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|This is an exceptional start in visualizing a great book series.  Some of my favorite characters and the ones we love to hate.  The casting was inspired.  Graphic realism, one of the elements Mr. Martin uses so well in depicting human nature was used just enough.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The most fun I have had since, well, I can't remember when !!! Not only is it challenging but it is a fun game. I find myself playing beyond my preset time limits and that is not like me at all. I am looking forward to trying the next edition of the game.

0893860468|5.0|I've been meaning to write a review of this book for some time now, but have never seemed to get around to it. It was the recent release of another \\"spiritual\\" book that reminded me the importance of this one.<br /><br />  I've read quite a few spiritual texts and books and I have to say this is one of the best books on spirituality I have ever read. While I've read, \\"Talks With Ramana Maharshi\\" and really enjoyed the profundity of it (it is also an absolute must read!), I think \\"I AM THAT\\"  resonates with me a little more. The format and talks are simple and clear, yet profound.<br /><br />  If I had to choose only a couple of \\"must have\\" spiritual books, this definitely would be one of them!<br /><br />Eric

B00ADQPA38|3.0|I can understand Falchuk and Murphy's desire to really &#34;cut loose&#34; in the second series of AHS. I can fully grasp their desire to experiment with a more graphic visual realization of creepy ideas and open more doors for the excellent cast to enter and display their scene-chewing chops, but gratuitousness, in and of itself, should never be mistaken for artfulness in a series format, and nothing can mask the abominable pacing, incoherent plotting, half-baked ideas and shoehorned &#34;resolutions&#34; they served-up in Season Two. The first season (&#34;Murder House&#34;) series struck an almost perfect balance between shocking visual horrors and compelling psychological drama -- all driven by a strong, linear plot that delivered not only the right amount of chills but enough necessary &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; to allow viewers ample space to really feel something for the characters.<br /><br />'Asylum' fails on all counts except for the remarkable acting, the fabulous cinematography and the outright inventiveness apparent in its creators' ambitions, at least initially. The biggest problem is that the creators simply (and quite clearly) lost control of their own inventiveness, and we have, basically, an overcooked and only occasionally frightening mess. Does AHS: Asylum have its stunning moments? You BET it does! But those moments, scattered here and there like unexpected jewels amid the poor plotting, instead of being the natural fruit of good plotting, do not make for a uniformly convincing effort, much less a classic. Please, guys. Not everyone on earth is a scatterbrained refugee of the dumbed-down Subculture of the Aimless, bizarrely &#34;proud&#34; of their self-diagnosed (or lazily diagnosed) ADHD. Do it the way it's always been done: Great Idea, Great Characters, Great Plot, Great Performances, Great Visuals, and Great Execution -- then make those aspects work harmoniously. You'll satisfy anyone with a functioning brain. Don't throw a hundred disconnected motifs at us in the hope we'll mistake the sensory overload for a satisfying story. Can't fool us all, you know.<br /><br />Let's look at what works wonderfully in Series Two: Jessica Lange's knockout performance as Sister Jude/Judy Martin/&#34;Betty Drake&#34; is pure gold, and the entire season is worth watching just for her simmering, subtle, scary, spectacularly nuanced portrayal alone. Sarah Paulson's work as Lana nearly rivals that of Lange's, but the overall plot development for Paulson's character was better than what was given to Lange, so I'm sure that helped. Lana/Paulson gets to show the viewer more of her varied, lively dimensions because those dimensions are written into the plot and she can act-up-a-storm with them. Sister Jude's story is more boxed-in and her layers are inferred, manifested more by implication (e.g. a few unconvincing flashback scenes) than by any really meaty development of her character in the storyline. The rest of the cast is also quite good. Evan Peters delivers another great reading, even though his character, here, is not written with as much flair and depth as the 'Tate' character in season one. Still, he gets the most out of it, just like Lange did with her curiously under-written role. James Cromwell has some good moments as Doctor Arden, though his plot line soon becomes the most woefully disoriented and adrift of all the major characters' stories. Lily Rabe is excellent as the dual-spirited Sister Mary Eunice; her restrained, focused work really gives you the creeps on a number of occasions. Zachary Quinto is just great in a kind of blatantly ripped-off Silence of the Lambs &#34;Jame Gumm&#34; role. Chloe Sevigny turns in a good performance as the nymphomaniac. Joseph Fiennes is the only acting disaster in this tale, in my opinion. Fiennes is woefully miscast as the ambitious Monsignor (who is obviously British and who baptizes serial killers by IMMERSION in a kiddie-pool in front of the chapel altar and who issuddenly fast-tracked straight to a Cardinal's chair, bypassing bishop, after running a madhouse for years? Really, fellas? Really? If you're going to bash the Catholic Church as an institution --and that's fine by me-- do some freakin' research about the basic manner in which it operates. LAZY = I get distracted from the already ham-handed story because some dumb plot development forces me to say: &#34;Wait a sec ... that would never happen in a million years.&#34; ~Suspension of disbelief: that is just one example of glaring violation in Season Two~). Fiennes acting is Pinnochio-wooden, but the rest of the cast really shines, I must say. Even the pinhead, Pepper (Gosh -- worth buying to see that ugliness alone).<br /><br />The sets and costumes are also magnificent. Every one of them. The asylum common room may be a bit contrived and at times goofy in its melange of wandering, method-acting extras, but overall the atmosphere of claustrophobia and perversion and inescapable wickedness is on lavish display for audiences, particularly in the HD Blu-Ray formatting. Attention-to-detail and expert cuts and blocks and angles make this a complete thrill to behold. So many images and sequences are truly affecting: The Angel of Death, the Name Game interlude (SING IT, Jessica Lange!), the Possession scene, the grainy &#34;investigative report&#34; scenes filmed by Lana as she goes back to Briarcliff, etc.<br /><br />What fails: the story, many of the concepts, and the plot development. Big time. The basic setting of a mental institution run by a nun-with-a-past, a secret Nazi torturer, a nun possessed by a minion of Hell, a reporter with a scent for trouble, a psychiatrist with a terrifying secret, and an ambitious cleric -- all of whom are affected by the arrival of a particularly notorious serial killer (&#34;Bloody Face&#34;) provided MORE than enough fertile ground for cohesive development of an addictive, compelling story featuring natural and supernatural scares. Noinordinate additives needed. Instead, the tale is sabotaged from the outset by some godawful crap about alien abductions and probings and fixations and possible impregnations that goes ABSOLUTELY nowhere, is never remotely explained, contemplated, or resolved and seems attached to the main plot with Elmer's glue, like macaroni artwork to a kindergartner's post-nap time construction-paper project. Truly stupid. Dr. Arden was an ambitious character, but his experiments on the &#34;woodland dwellers&#34; made no sense whatsoever. We are encouraged to fear the beasts we cannot quite see outside the Asylum, but in the end we learn that they are ... pretty much POINTLESS and needed only to provide Mark Consuelos with a job? Luckily, they are disposed-of in the way that most awful, tangential plot devices are disposed-of by the clearly in-over-their-heads creators/writers. Wow, that was just ... ridiculous.<br /><br />This brings us to the gore itself: The gore was way overdone and quite often heaved at us at all the wrong times. Of course, gore is grand in a true horror tale, but let the &#34;gory serve the story&#34; ... and not the other way around. The misplaced, mistimed and misbegotten gore &#34;shocks&#34; distracted from this viewer's attempt to actually care about these characters. By the end, I didn't. For example, the immolation scene w/ Arden and Sister Mary Eunice was filmed as if viewers were expected to feel some wistful, poignant moment ... WHAH? The scene was actually, laugh-out-loud hilariously stupid and what viewer in their right mind would care about Arden to begin with? The writers tried, at various junctures, to give a glimpse of some redemptive humanity in Arden, but a disfiguring, sadistic,torturing Nazi lobotomist & Mad Scientist needed a LOT more &#34;humanizing&#34; if we were truly expected not to chuckle at his final scene. Again, this is one of many examples of the herky-jerky writing that neutralized any truly compelling quality in the overall story. Others abound. Alma appearing (with baby) in Kit's trashed house (What had she been doing for months? Not cleaning, that's for sure.). Dylan McDermott's little storyline was largely hokey and über-contrived (but kudos for the best stunt-casting EVER with the girl who played Katherine Martin in &#34;Lambs&#34; becoming the victim of ... a skin-flayer!) and the interlude with the breast-milk fetish was utterly (udderly?) brilliant with stupidity. What an unintentional howler! Basically, the sense that the creators and writers were caught in a riptide of convoluted plot-holes, dead-end detours, incoherent tangents and narrative doom was bracingly apparent midway through the season.<br /><br />I &#34;get&#34; that much of this season was intended to be an &#34;homage&#34; to the vast and complex magnificence of the horror-genre itself, but you make your &#34;homages&#34; appear as subtle little gifts throughout the story, boys & girls. You don't make them into the building-blocks and entire scaffolding of your overall project. That's a great recipe for losing your grip on a potentially spectacular tale. That's what happened here, with Season Two. Visually stunning and expertly acted and rife with many gripping, isolated moments -- AHS:Asylum is a gigantic, ambitious and expensively appointed story that, unfortunately, never manages to equal the sum of its many flailing parts -- the superb and the harebrained. I was dismayed by the lack of cleverness, because I bought the series without having seen any of the televised episodes, based upon my admiration for the excellent craftsmanship in series One.<br /><br />These things being noted: any true horror fan should add this to their collection. It is well worth owning as a landmark in horror films (and let's face it -- these have the cinematographic ambition of big-screen films, after all). The Blu-Ray edition is immaculate, with all the usual bells and whistles. Though I do believe the creators lost their way, mightily, with Asylum, it's still light years better than 99% of the crap you'll see elsewhere on TV and in theaters. I realize that isn't saying much, but it is meant as a compliment. Falchuk and Murphy have promised a return to a much more story-centered, calibrated exploration of supernatural/horror themes with series three (Coven) and I think they have all the talent to make something even better than Murder House. It won't take much to get better than this. I look forward to Series Three.

B008GXHOFW|1.0|I actually do NOT remember purchasing/playing this game. That should likely give you a good idea as to how well it played for me. I remember just about every game I've so much as glanced at - and this game is not remembered at all. I cannot honestly say if it was good or bad though - just that one should proceed with caution if you go to play this game. I love all things Spiderman - and yet, if I cannot remember something to do with that character...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I could not put it down! So many twists and turns.  Just when you think you have it figured out, something else happens!
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|This game advertised itself as one thing and turned out to be another. Some of that is my fault, likely I should have read the fine print, instead of just scanning it - but I thought I was getting into an adventure game...not a world builder. Honestly, The Croods at least told you what you were getting into. This was just...a disaster. My surprise and annoyance was absolute when I first loaded in. I wanted adventure - not world-building - so two hundred points lost on that score.<br /><br />Here's a tip. Do NOT call yourself 'Epic' if you are going to join the masses of world-builders who probably have done it better without the well-known characters to lean on.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|There were so many characters and so many scenes that I struggled to follow the multiple storylines. It left me with so many questions and conflicts that I will have to reread when I have a large block of time.

B00CSYR432|5.0|This movie is definitely something to have in your collection.<br /><br />This is an upbeat charmer of a movie from the Studio Ghibli camp. The characters are older than a lot of the prior movies I have seen. Characters either have responsibilities or on the verge of gaining some. There is this constant balancing of youthful naivety, responsibility, and those high school emotions that allow this movie to stand out. I don't necessarily find some of the situations in the movie to be entirely realistic, but they do serve a metaphorical and emotionally tying purpose.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie where you will enjoy the ride through to the end. There are plenty comedic antics and hilarious characterizations, and all of these stem from the personality and emotional depth of a story where so much seems unfair. A few rambunctious high school kids remain the underdogs to the inequities of life, and I feel that the story draws its humor and its tension from its ability to stage naivety and inequity under a coming of age type build (for lack of a better phrase). The harsh realities crush the naivety of our characters. In these defeats, the story is finding humor in heartbreak, and the characters develop a new way to combat some of the inequities in life.

B004WJRTXG|4.0|I really enjoy Jonathan Tropper - and was so pleased to get hold of this book. It is a story about a young widower whose wife has died in an plane crash. As he tries to deal with his grief - his family attempt to get him back to a more normal way of life. It is sad and funny. perhaps the grieving is a wee bit exaggerated - however it is a good read and has moments of humour that kept me chuckling.
030758836X|4.0|This is the first review I've ever written.  This book is captivating.  At first, it sounded a lot like a popular murder case that was in the news a few years back, wife missing, showed up dead, husband looked innocent until the end when you find out he killed her.  Then poof, the plot twisted and you didn't know what was going to happen.  It is a great read.  The author is gifted with her words and descriptions to make you feel what is going on, as if you are one of the characters looking on and judging and rejudging.  I was initially disappointed with the ending because I like happy final endings.  I verbally groaned, \\"Ahhh, nooooo!\\"  It is the first book I've read that didn't have a final ending.....except gone with the wind.  However, the more my thoughts continued after I finished the book, the more it grew on me and can accept it.

0062255657|4.0|When I was a boy I had a terrible thing happen to me.  It happened early in the morning, and was over almost as quickly as it started.  When it was over, not knowing what else to do, I went about my day as usual.  I remember now, that that very evening, I questioned whether it really happened, or if it had been a dream.  By the next day, I remembered nothing about it.  Five years later, I learned of something similar happening to someone I knew, and I thought \\"Thank goodness nothing like that happened to me\\", which was immediately countered by another thought from somewhere deep in the back of my head: \\"Oh yes it did.\\"  The memories came flooding back then, and I was overwhelmed by the sudden truth that enveloped me as all the details of that morning returned to consciousness.<br /><br />The Ocean at The End of the Lane is the story of a man who suddenly and wholly remembers the buried events of a few important days 40 years earlier.  It's an adult fairy tale, and on the surface it's an entertaining book with very little to be taken seriously.  But for anyone who's experienced the revelation of a suppressed memory, it's a glimpse into what that experience is all about, without the devastation that generally accompanies it. This book did much for me.<br /><br />It was my first time reading Neil Gaiman.  I'll certainly be picking up some more of his books.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|My kids have been enthralled since getting it. Good mini games and puzzles that keep them learning. And the creepy factor has been perfect for Halloween time.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The acting if really good, music is excellent and the script has depth that usually lacking from similar types of shows, such as &#34;The Killing.&#34;<br /><br />Recommend highly; it stayed with me and made me think about it after watching.
B00EXVZW6E|1.0|I had so looked forward to playing this game; as it had nothing but 5 star reviews.<br />Now for the reason for my 1 star. I tried to open the app around 3 am, and nothing but a black screen  I tried different ways to open, to no avail. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Still nothing. At noon today, I tried yet again. After looking at a black screen for 10 minutes, I gave up. I then read the new reviews, and foubd some troubling info re: flurry analytics. Perhaps my tablet was smarter than I, and decided that was enough to justify not opening. I usually don't install apps that have such permissions. I missed it this a.m. at 3. So, for those of you who don't care about such things and cang it to open, enjoy. The rest of us will be fine.
B007A2O3FO|3.0|I'm not sure what was missing.  It all seemed pretty predictable and the end was telegraphed about 15 minutes into the movie.  I understand it's basically a children's movie, but there was no scare there at all.  It does have a beautiful look.  Maggie Smith is always amazing and I thought the child actors did a very credible job.  I always love seeing Pauline Collins and I'm thinking we're likely to see her and Timothy Spall show up in Downton Abbey eventually.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Unbelievable that a girl so young had to endure all that she did. I honestly don't know how.  She must be incredibly strong.  God bless Jaycee and her two girls.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Works fine for me. Does what it says it will in the description. Nothing fancy and I like that the ads are all on the last page and not cluttering up the main screen.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I could not put this fantastic whodunit down. I did not guess the murderer until nearly the end. Well written characters who are scary easy to understand as well<br />Great book.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I never played Angry Birds until I got my kindle.  It is a very fun game on my kindle.  My grandkids told me I would like this game,<br /> they were right. I love the games. Now if I could just manage to hit the target.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|The writers have covered a wide range of topics very tastefully while making the episodes quite interesting, dramatic and character development is very good.
0399159347|5.0|This book had was great! There were quite a few twists and turns. I recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting read.
0142501123|5.0|I love reading this to my son, who is almost 4.  The illustrations are fun, the rhymes are fun...This one and the Night Before Halloween are my son's two favorite halloween books.  This one is a keeper!
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|A little tired but fun...ending was hysterical....good if you watched the first two but not if you did not..i recommend
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|I only made it through a few pages of this one because the author's apparent view of God is that He (he, she or it) is some sort of impersonal genie in a bottle bound to do your bidding. That is not my belief system and I found her suppositions to be offensive. If you have no particular belief in a personal God or if your supreme authority is a little 'g' then you may find this book enlightening.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Yes, there are many discussions, writings and publications on this topic. One reason is we continue to struggle in our humanity to connect and integrate the powerful spiritual principles given us as co-creators by our creator, source, God. Pam Grout has brought these principles, laws, precious gifts into a framework that connects them to the real intention of how to live brilliantly and abundantly.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Never watched the show on tv but became addicted when I gave it a try on Netflix.  I loved the character development and thought the writers did a great job on each script.  Netflix didn't have the 6th. season and had to know how it ended, so I bought it.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Action scenes were good.<br />Best of the trilogy.  However, the storyline is week.<br />Computer graphics that related to the donning and doffing of his 'suit' were excellent.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun and addicting game but the Facebook challenges are annoying. Just  like any other though where everything gets more and more expensive and they want you to buy credits and all that.
0375842209|2.0|I'm calling it quits on p. 150. I haven't gotten sucked into the book and there are just too many others I want to read.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|One of my favorite online games.  UNO is a classic and a lot of fun.  I enjoy the challenge of playing against others.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Thank you for sparking my love life again!  My fianc&eacute; thanks you!  I can't wait for the 4th book and will be re reading the series on my honeymoon!
B007EDZ20O|4.0|I was hoping for more dirt on that old Albanian fascist.  But Hitch compensates with sharp, entertaining writing, as always.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love love loooooooved these books!!! I can't wait for the movies, but I do wish that the series continued. Would like to read more of his dirty antics
0880796863|4.0|I would suggest either buying a tarot guide separately or just using the internet to learn. The mini guidebook included here is not very useful. The cards are perfect though!
B000FC13MM|5.0|Short and sweet is all that is needed...<br /><br />Garth Nix is one of my favorite authors, I absolutely love the worlds he creates. The world within Sabriel and the rest of the series is indescribably amazing.  Anyone and everyone who loves fantasy will greatly enjoy this book as well as the rest of the series!!
B00873GRU4|3.0|It took about 45% of the way through the ebook before I really started enjoying it. This is more my fault than the author's because I prefer action to introspection. Once it did get going, it became much more enjoyable and I could see why it was such a hit. If you like a lot of action, have patience and it will eventually turn up.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love this game. Works great on my kindle hd. Plays the same as when I play it on facebook.  Haven't had any issues.  Very addictive just like many other Facebook games.  Sucks you right in.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Any fan of the movies will love this game. It's well made and runs great. Makes me smile every time I play.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Game as a whole is awesome but I am constantly disconnecting from matches on co-op online 9/10 Times and its extremely annoying
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is probably the best sequel ever made! I'm so excited to get &#34;The Prince' another amazing book by Kiera Cass
B006FPFTMS|5.0|I gave this app five stars, because it worked excellently.  I needed to download a copy of a PDF from a website and view it on my Kindle when I was at the local internet café.  I chose this app, because it was given a fairly high rating.  It turned out to be a good choice, because it works well.  I like it so much that I have downloaded the PC version.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|First off, I'm a hardcore Korn fan. I've enjoyed every single album they've put out. Even the less popular ones. And yes, this album might not be \\"as good\\" as some of their past albums. But don't let that fool you. \\"The Paradigm Shift\\" is a great/solid album. The lyrics by themselves are just fantastic. The guitar riffs for this album may not seem as intense as past albums such as \\"Untouchables\\" or \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\", but great nonetheless. All in all, I loved this album. I'm tired of hearing fans complain that their current music doesnt sound like their earlier albums. It's not supposed to, it's called evolution, people. Korn as a band has evolved over the years and hasn't been afraid to try new things and experiment with their music. If you're expecting this album to sound like their debut album, your out of luck. Bottom line, if you're a REAL Korn fan, than you'll enjoy this album like I did....
B009PMEEY2|5.0|And a fantastic time-waster and maybe, a bit addictive, but I still give it a five.  The graphics in this app are superb and are one of the reasons that I keep playing.  I don't know how many levels there are, but some of them are quite difficult.  To move from one level to the next, string together items on the board to create chains of three or more items.  Plus, there are two modes.  I am playing the timed mode, and am stuck.  Once the board is complete, then there is a piece of the particular talisman that has to be moved down the board in a certain amount of time before moving to the next level.  One has to be careful when stringing together the different objects, because it is easy to leave one piece in a corner and spend the remainder of the time trying to get two more of the same objects next to it to complete the level.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|The story rambled too much.  It went on and on about things that did not add to the story.  It was the second Cornwell novel that I did not care for.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Best iron man yet i think, keep them coming. Great actors and great chemistry together. One of my favorite movie series.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I use it in my Kindle Fire HD (8.9&#34;), and I lack support for my native language which would make this application so much more useful, not to mention the device in general, and I just happens to know that Linux in general (also Android which is based upon Linux, and the proprietary OS the Kindle Fire uses is based on Android) does support my native language through the i18n package. i18n is a short for internationalization which is a 20 letters word, though it is antidisestablishmentarianism the longest & undisputed word in English.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Very good CD only thing the case was cracked when I received it but CD is great.  Highly recommend it to country music lovers
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Love it-- Helen Mirran is great. Initially, Queen Elizabeth (Mirran) does seem distant and dis-engaged from some of the realities of modern day life. However, the part where Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) castigates his staff, referring to Elizabeth II's life long service-- a life she never asked for--is very affecting as it is certainly true.<br />The end in hindsight is pretty ironic as PM's come and go-- the monarch continues!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Goodbye IOS and hello Android. Need I say more. The functions and apps just keep getting better and better every day.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|This book beautifully captures the loneliness if command, the life at sea during the age of sail.  The friendship between Jack and Stephen shows opposites make for great pairs.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Product was new and in great condition..Very Pleased with this purchase. I would use this vender again when I decide to purchase another series season.
B006JD48NM|5.0|A truly great film. Can't speak more highly of it. Even if you're not a Formula one fan you will appreciate this film. Senna was a truly remarkable human being.
B00594XOZU|3.0|I used this app for a while now it wont let me log in...needs fixed NOW hopefully i can use it again soon
B009UX2YAC|3.0|At first it was fun but it soon was not so fun wen I got more games but it was free. :)
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Got these to replace the series to Blu-ray from DVD.  I won't rate the movies as they are classics.  The Blu-ray transition seems to work fine for us.
B00190N4E4|5.0|I've seen this twice, once in high school as an assignment, and once 15 years later. It had power back then and has more now. Recommended for all who wish for a better world.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Got these to replace the series to Blu-ray from DVD.  I won't rate the movies as they are classics.  The Blu-ray transition seems to work fine for us.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it! So creative. The characters are amazing. I love the contrast between Katniss and Peta. The end makes you want to get the second goodnight away just overcast comes next! I couldn't put it down!
B00E9E4EC8|3.0|I am an Alan Jackson fan, and I love bluegrass music - the reason I bought this CD.  Honestly, even with some of the best pickers in the business, this CD is only &#34;fair to middlin&#34;.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great job this game rock. Wish the guns and upgrades were cheaper. Still pleased with this game. Glu has done a great job on this game.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|I bought this Blu-ray version of Grease to see if there was a big difference.  Honestly, it is a great, classic movie but the main difference in the Blu-ray and regular DVD is the sound.  I still think it is worth the price.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I couldn't put it down... Sad, sweet, hopeful, joyous, heartwarming. I highly recommend it to anyone who has been looking a great read.  I Loved it!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Christan Bale, makes the best Btman yet, so they should keep the Batman, as he battled his crime lorders who think they can over throw the city and called it their own, these series were the best to come out yet. But with the Worlds Finest, it should be Bale, as Batman, and the new superman to work together instead of at each other.
0802130208|5.0|Book came in EXCELLENT condition! Absolutely lived the story.  I finished it in 2 days.  Highly recommend for a good, refreshing read!
B008RV5K4U|5.0|These are some of the best cartoons that have come out, it plays right up to where the new cartoon Batman, with the young person taking over the Cape and Cowl.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am a freshman wallflower who has seniors as my only friends and I related so much to this book as well as my best friend also killed themselves. I recommend this book to anyone and love it so much read it third time and I'll read it again and again and again.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Loved it lots of action. Goes with keeping some of the lines with The Avengers, keeps you on your toes.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Setting up the three groups of characters took awhile, but once Cecelia opens the letter from her husband, the drive to find out what happens is strong.  I like books with drive and I like that this book did not follow any &#34;formula&#34;.  I really had compassion for some of the individuals involved.  Coming to the end of the book I thought it was very good, but the &#34;frosting on the cake&#34; was the epilogue.  Very interesting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a terrific game I'm sooo addicted I will play this game everyday I would totally recommend this game most definitely
B008XG1X18|4.0|Although it is easier to organize my pins on my laptop, it's wonderful to able to view them all and add more anytime I want to via the app.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Love the game but I think it is too expensive. I think u could charge .99 &amp; still make money. $2.99 for extra help is high, u can easily spend over $10 on one level. Like the new update. Is there a book of<br />strategy for this game like Candy Crush?<br /><br />I am 73 however my great-grandson plays on this ereader
B001F6TXME|5.0|An absolutely great solution for the camera shakes. Leaves you camera hands free. Works very well and is well worth the money. 6/3/15. I can't even begin to tell you how much I use and like this product. This is a must for tripod mounted macro/landscape photography. I like it much more then a wireless remote that requires keeping batteries on hand.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Seems like a great game. I really loved 2013. The graphics are more then worth the fun.<br /><br />I recommend this game for all you hunters out there
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool. It might be better than temple run. I really like sub way surfers. Next they need to do one in like France. They need to let you make your own character. Over all this game is great!!!!!!
B00F8802SE|5.0|My husband and I are totally addicted to this show.  We gave up cable a few months ago.  Do they typically wait until after the season starts to offer it on Amazon?  Seeing &#34;Starz&#34; and 1/1/2014 is not making me a happy camper. I have been waiting for tomorrow night as well.  Just concerned that I won't be able to purchase the whole season....Any input would be very much appreciated!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awsome the new one is awesome it has a halloween touch and it really is the best game. Of the year in my opinion
B00F35BV64|4.0|Interesting story line twist, recycling old lines(pHunny).<br />I was hoping for something better, perhaps on the next one that comes out.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I don't know its nice but it won't let me take a video but I do like it I don't know.why it doesn't work
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|As a long time Gladwell fan, I was thrilled to purchase this book. Gladwell delivers his usual, fascinating twist on a subject you thought you understood -- what's an advantage or disadvantage? However, this book deals with a substantially darker set of subjects than his previous ones. Topics include Nazis, childhood leukemia, the Protestant-Catholic conflicts in Belfast, and the murder of children. These choices didn't make the book any less compelling or the message less interesting, but they did make it substantially less light hearted and fun. I found that, as a result, I didn't enjoy reading it as much as other Gladwell favorites.
0307352153|5.0|Agreed with all of the reviews that said the book was an affirmation for introverts, but also sheds some light on extrovert behavior and how we came to be \\"the Cult of Personality \\" The book provides great talking points for introverts to better explain themselves and research to back them when they talk about relying on intuition, needing alone time, and how being a presenter and the life of the party are two different things. It should be a must read for dysfunctional work teams when personalities conflict.
0345803485|5.0|I read it already.  I'm taking it with me on a cruise for 7 days and I'm going to read it again.  Love the story behind all of the steamy parts.  There really is an actual story....a good one!
B003UBTX72|5.0|What a fantastic book by one of the most influential musicians of the last fifty years. Keith Richards tells us how a boy of little means, with all odds against him becoming famous and influential, finally becomes the loved and revered backbone of arguably one of the worlds greatest musical groups.<br /><br />I've come to appreciate The Rolling Stones at a time in my life that I consider mature and contemplative. I've listened to them since I was born but started to appreciate them in my late forties. The sole the band is clearly Keith. If it were 100% of Keith's reckoning I believe that he would have become a black blues musician living a mild existence in the Mississippi delta of the United States. Keith informs us that is where his sole really is.<br /><br />His relationship with Mick Jagger is one of those unique times in the course of human existence in which us \\"lucky\\" one's are graced with the oportunity to have a co-inspirational figure that makes us better at what we do.<br /><br />****  Interruption *** *** More later ***
B00723NWJE|5.0|I was surprised to hear that they were working together. I have liked Nora for some time, but haven't followed every CD. She puts me to sleep (its a good thing, she relaxes me)<br /><br />So upon hearing this album in full, I was really amazed that it worked; the team up of these two. Now I've liked pretty much most of her stuff....been a fringe fan though, not die hard. I have to be in the right mood.<br /><br />I like every song on this collection, its amazing, ,the arrangements and compositions/lyrics. Very well done<br /><br />If you're a new fan, longtime, die hard fan, or just interested, check out this Cd its pretty amazing
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|This is a great game.  Not too hard but not too easy.  Each room has a different theme and the graphics are good.
B003B02O0A|5.0|What a great book! Saw the movie years ago, but have never read any of Grisham's books. The characters really draw you in, make you see them and be part of their lives. Can't wait for \\"Sycamore Row\\" to continue with these characters, but I'll be reading more of his books too.
B005PK553C|5.0|The best horror story EVER...it always keeps you guessing and in the edge of your seat...can't wait to start season 2!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I loved Oregon Trail as a kid and really looked forward to this game when I found it. The graphics are lovely, and I had fun setting up the town.  why this game has a 2 star review is mainly because this game is a major time sink.  I come in to play my energy, with plans to rearrange a few buildings, farm a bit, and then, as I'm ready to turn it off, disaster strikes. Now I have a building in peril and a pioneer hurt.  I don't spend real money on fake money, so I have to monitor the person while I craft the right things needed to help them.  And then another disaster and more pioneers hurt.  I have had two die because I didn't have the time to make sure they were healed. Also, the game won't save the names I give the people, so both graves say &quot;Pioneer died ...&quot;  So, fun game, too much time commitment.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|i really like this game, this is what i do when im bored.  i would strongly suggest it. u will really like it
B007THA4FI|2.0|Most of the characters were unbelievably neurotic, if not psychotic, and there is very little hope in this book.  I don't have to have a happy ending, and the denoument of all this was fairly clever, but it was tough to read it.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|This is the only Jude Law movie I can stomach watching.  Should have won best picture Oscar.  Even Nicole Kidman was excellent in this movie.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is not smooth, it takes a lot effort to get the cards to move on a Kindle Fire.<br />I like Solitaire (Free) a lot better
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game! You don't have to wait forever to gain funds and there is plenty to do ingame. The only thing is that it is very hard to get credits unless you buy them. Besides that I highly recommed this game!
B000009ROK|5.0|This is gorgeous music....I am fluent in Spanish and old enough to remember these songs of my youth.  Hearing them makes me long to be in love again......the lushness of the orchestra is stunning.....don't miss this.....
B004FOOQV6|1.0|This app requires a connection to Amazon to  function.  No internet or if you aren't signed into Amazon, it throws an error and shuts down.  Otherwise a very good converter app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good fun to past the time away. Lots of fun for me and my kids on those long trips to different places.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is boss!!!  I love it!  i would recommend it for anyone! It is the best game ever!  i am addicted to it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My son found this game and now me, him and my husband are playing it all the time and all devices.
B007DIQB50|5.0|IT'S BAD ASS CD. & VERY HARD  I LIKE IT AND WILL YA'LL GO AND BUY IT  IS  GOOD CD
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the way it challenges me it wants to play it all the time I have  the chance I have. I have  a lot of free time
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I give this a 5 star review and most people probably wouldn't agree with me. They seem to be stuck on the old Christopher Reeve Superman movies and don't really see this as a good Superman movie.<br /><br />But I think that the directors and producers didn't want to make this into a remake or a tribute to those old and still good Superman movies.<br /><br />I find that this is first and foremost an origin story. Most people that I speak to about this movie don't seem to understand that. All superheroes have to start somewhere. Superman didn't know what kind of superhero he wanted to be. But he knew that he was one. Or that he would be a supervillan, but his upbringing with his human parents made him understand what sort of man he was supposed to be, even if that man was a little different than the average.<br /><br />I liked that we didn't see much of Superman himself. We got to see more of Clark Kent as an adult learning to go about his own way in world he wasn't sure was ready for someone like him. And it seems that most people in that world were not. Until Zod and his cronies showed up and Clark was forced to out himself, I have a feeling that Clark would have been perfectly happy to be that man in the background that saves people.<br /><br />I absolutely adored the way that they created Lois Lane. That is the one big pick about the Superman mythos is that if Lois Lane is a reporter, she would have figured out and did investigating on her own to figure out exactly who Superman was, especially if she was obsessed about him as she is supposed to be. In many incarnations of the Superman myth, Clark himself has to tell Lois who he is. This Lois took charge and used resources and chewed on this like a dog with a bone to find out exactly who the superhero was, even before he was Superman.<br /><br />So yes, I give this a 5 star rating. I loved this movie. Yeah, the destruction was a little much, but again, Superman and Zod aren't used to their powers and people shouldhave probably left the area anyway. I love movies with destruction and this wasn't enough to dampen my enthusiasm nor my rating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When I saw it I could not believe it was here I loved the movie and the cool thing it<br /><br />was free recommended for children everywhere beautiful graphics
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Awesome novel that distills the African immigrant experience with supreme detail in a compelling love story. Plot, prose and passion of the highest order.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|Everyone should have this CD. The classic performers on this album will never be again as two of them have already left us.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Riordan does a wonderful job of telling a story, while setting the stage for a much larger story to unfold.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the challenge of the game. I would like to see more levels or at least more details to each level.
B000W27AE0|5.0|More poppy than their debut but a must have for classic album collector. Their breakthrough album! Highly recommended. I have been waiting to get the remastered version.
1118109791|4.0|I wouldn't want this to be the only prep book I used. I hadn't taken a standardized test in a long time and this book helped me refocus my attention on the test taking process. I especially liked the section on the essay portion. The essay section was essential in explaining how they score and what I could do to help myself. Still I recommend getting extra materials or a tutor for your weak areas, at least through this book I could easily discover what those were.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This is a real page turner.  The method of writing one chapter from the point of view of the husband and the next from the point of view of the missing wife really works for this story.  My empathy for one of the characters (not giving anything away here!) became so strong that I was just desperate for justice to be served.  I strongly recommend this psychological thriller.
