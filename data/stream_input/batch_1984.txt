0525953590|5.0|I am nearly through this book and have enjoyed it immensely.  Although I have read several other books discussing the LHC and the search for the Higgs particle, this has gone deeper and has been more understandable than any.<br /><br />Dr. Carroll has so many folksy analogies and comparisons to help the nonscientist grasp the concepts.  One of his favorites -- to which he returns several times -- is to imagine navigating across a crowded cocktail party.  You are not stopped or delayed and cross the room rather quickly.  Now imagine Angelina Joli trying to make the identical passage.  She is continually waylaid and forced into conversations.  It likely will take her much longer to navigate across the room.  Thus, says Dr. Carroll, is the effect of the Higgs field.  Some particles are not affected by the Higgs field.  Such particles move at the speed of light -- electrons, neutrinos.  Others are retarded considerably -- like so many celebrities at the imaginary cocktail party.  Some are retarded more than others -- essentially, they have more mass.  This is just one example of many that could be chosen.<br /><br />Dr. Carroll has a chapter on fields versus particles.  He clarified this distinction for me excellently.  I had always imagined that subatomic particles were important, and fields just secondary.  Carroll urges the reader to put the primacy on fields, and says that particles could be thought of as just waves in a field, or disturbances in a field.  They are just manifestations of fields.  Quite a remarkable shift of perspective, and one that clarified a lot for me.<br /><br />The writing style is very well done, with enough humor and whimsy to keep pages turning.  Quite a few excellent color photos are included, as are numerous line-drawings.  For those who would like to dig deeper, the book includes three appendices.<br /><br />Highly recommended:
B005LAIHYU|3.0|I would say that it didn't have interesting moments, but it was far fetched enough that it lost me a few times during the movie. What's next - George Washington: Zombie Hunter?
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is extremely well done.  Based on a true story of the 101st Airborne in World War 2.  I experienced a wide range of emotions watching the series but in the end had a ton of pride for our men and women in the military, especially this particular group of heroes.
0064430170|2.0|The book was recommended as a great children's book. I haven't read the story so I'm not sure about it as a children's book. I can speak to the quality of this book. I bought the paperback because I prefer that over hardcover, but the pages are all in black and white, which is very disappointing for a children's book.  I think the best part of children's books are the large colorful images.
0307887448|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book since I'm a child of the 70's and 80's, had a Commodore 64, and played a lot of video games.  I loved all of the pop culture references from the time and had fun reliving my childhood and teenage years.  The book also has some interesting ideas and overall \\"puzzle\\" for the protagonist to complete.  My main problem with it is that the dialog seems like it was written by a teenager rather than a 40 year old writer.  It's as is if this novel was targeted to the young adult readership except it has way too many cuss words, inappropriate content, and most of the references in the book would be lost on today's teenagers.  So I don't really understand who the audience is for this book.  In the hands of a better writer this would have been a 5 star book.  Unfortunately the author spent very little time making his characters 3 dimensional and the dialogue for the most part is terrible.  But the overall plot and events in the book sort of make up for the lack of characterization and turned it into a fun read for me.  It's just too bad he didn't spend more time making his characters into believable 19 and 20 year olds instead of making them sound like 12 year old jerks.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The most dramatically intense series I've seen. Extremely well-done and completely involving!  Can't wait for season two to come out on DVD.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Simply Awesome... I loved it, read it in 4 days, cannot wait for more. Prequels, sequels, whatever. 50 silos could equal 100 more stories and Hugh Howley can make every one of them a chapter in a multi-novel series or each silo's story could be a book in itself. My search for more starts now....
1616960922|4.0|Brandon Sanderson isn't so good at going short; However he is really good at writing and packing in ideas, so it balances out to a short novel. The premise of forging souls is quite unique, as is usual for Mr. Sanderson, and that isn't the only magic system in the book (also usual). If it could have been a little longer that would have been good.
B005LAII12|1.0|Guys, little tip: this is not a date movie.  Maybe watch this for guys night?  I saw about the first 10-15 minutes and asked my date to turn it off.  Stupidest movie I have ever seen.  Downright degrading to woman and plays to the \\"we are all stupid and isn't that so funny\\" humor, which I do not find amusing at all.  Swearing and drug use does not bother me.  Stupid people acting stupid for the sake of just being stupid is not entertainment.  It's just stupid and gets old fast.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|really pretty and excellent production values, but what a waste of time and plastic!  Maybe it's just that the Twilight girl only has one facial expression -- and clueless-vacant doesn't get you very far in story-telling.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|It streamed nicely and it was just what i wanted to watch. I am excited to watch more. Please, enjoy.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I keep 2 of these -- one in my purse and the other by my chair -- got me through a 27 hour blackout!  Perfect size, though a little heavy in the hand.
B001EN71CW|4.0|One of the few orders that have taken the full delivery time. Amazon may have spoiled me in my expectations. But it was worth waiting. Colors seem a little  week or the picture is a little bright. But the picture has a lot of detail.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love the way he writes. Love learning the history through his dynamic and interesting characters. I am waiting for #3!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Couldn't put this book down!  Great love story as you follow the ups and downs of Travis and Abby's relationship.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I loved this book until near the end. Then it got more complicated than it needed to be and I could no longer follow the background story. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the exciting finish.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|In my opinion, this currently ranks in the top 5 television series currently airing. I love the plot and sub plots of American Horror Story: Asylum. The actors do the script justice with their brilliant character portrayals. Highly recommended show for any horror or mystery genre fan.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|My kid loves the Toy Story series! Perfect to play on PS3, Kindle Fire, and PC.  This movie is an instant classic.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Excellent film.  The acting was fantastic and so was the director.  This is one movie that should have walked off with all the awards.  I would not call this an entertaining movie, because it is not.  It's a heavy duty drama that focuses on a subject that few people wish to examine in depth.  It's not a \\"weepy\\" or \\"melodramatic\\" drama. It's not a love story, its a chronicle of tragedy.  It tends to put the viewer more in a state of horrific wonder as they watch the screen. There are no light moments.<br /><br />The movie is disturbing and bleak, but then again it's about a part of life that very few people have to deal with or even attempt to justify; let alone witness it up close and personal.  The movie is so realistic that its like watching a case study in which a family unravels; and hits its zenith when a violent act of rage is committed by the teenage son.  The devil did not make him do it, his rage did.  There is no forgiveness displayed in this film by anyone... it is a brutal.<br /><br />Well, it's a five Star movie, that's for sure.  If you are empathetic or very sensitive, it is disturbing. Just keep telling yourself \\"its only a movie\\" or don't watch it. I was expecting a drama, but frankly I wasn't expecting this.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a very interesting study of different characters.  It  is a bittersweet story of growing older; not far from the truth!
B008MU8ZNO|4.0|This film is truly a labor of love. Just watch-in the Blu-ray extras-the effort put in the auditions for the klowns.<br />The Chiodo brothers packed the story with a unceasing cascade of the gimmicks, tricks and ploys<br />of the clown's trade, spiced up with morbid humor.<br />Even the wooden acting of the protagonists enhances the hilariousness.<br />It's not on par with the best moments of Tim Burton's films, but it's in the same zany universe.<br />The Blu-ray is also a labor of love: The image is sharp, the colors are vibrant, and there's popcorn<br />buckets of extras.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am a teacher and love reading what my students are interested in at the time.  I put off reading these until the Christmas break and could not put them down when I started!!!
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|It was OK. I expected it be a lot scarier. Did not get the ending. What was wrong with the mom?
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|A super duper read and one I wish I had gotten in paperback so that I may stand it proudly on my bookshelf! I thoroughly enjoyed it and I could not put it down. I love the new characters and enjoyed reading about them altogether as a team, now that they have met up in  ***SPOILER*** New Rome! Such a dramatic ending! Loved it!
B005PK553C|5.0|I love it. I think it is better than the 2nd season. More interesting to me. Not as bloody. Jessica Lane played a great part. It had a great ending.
067144901X|5.0|Can't go wrong with anything written by Sandra Boynton for babies and toddlers.  As a board book, it holds up well (and even gets a chew now and then from the teethers!)  But it's a darling story as all kids love animal sounds.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am a big fan of Kate Morton and, once again, she kept me coming back for more!
B001BANK32|5.0|Classic Stephen King that I was finally able to read. Chilling, and surprisingly different than the movie. Highly recommended to all horror fans.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing book! So hard to put down· A true love story! You really fall in love with the characters and their story
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Now I have a calculator with me at all times. I like how large the numbers are and how it delete your work right away.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read this late into the night. Had to finish it and now can't wait to read the last book. Awesome!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I LOVE this app!!! No more late days for me! You can set the volume on it, which is a helpful thing since I am a deep sleeper!
B0063GORYU|3.0|fun game, but when trying to place a card on specific pile (when there are more then one possibilities) you have to be very careful, or it places it where it wants to, and that is not always the best play, adding to your moves count.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|These books are well written and one can't put them down,they are very very exciting. wish the author was still with us.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|This is a small case for a larger camera.<br />It's well padded, with a firm rigid molded bottom that is water proof so you can set down the case almost anywhere safely. The strap has a padded area to make it more comfortable to carry and it's long enough and adjustable enough to be used to carry the case across your body.<br /><br />The inside is a soft, fleece like microfiber and there are two adjustable straps with Velcro that you can move to accommodate your lens and the body of your camera making for the best possible fit for your camera.<br /><br />Outside pockets to hold small things, the one on the front has slots for extra memory cards.<br /><br />This case isn't designed to hold a lot of extras, just the basics to grab and go. For that use, it's perfect. It's a snug, secure fit for my camera. The stitching, fabric and design are all well done.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|The book is fast paced and fun but I was probably a bit too old for the book based on the read time. I would highly recommend this book for ambitious eight year olds to low teens who want a light read.
B00005OM5L|5.0|eric clapton is never a disappointment and this concert as in all others of him we have we enjoy over and over again
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Me gustó mucho x me nos sirve muchísimo para saber muchas cosas mi opinión es que el diccionario me ayudó mucho para aprenderme la lengua internacional y gracia x poner este servicio de kindle
B00428CPUY|5.0|if you like Eric Clapton and guitars it is a must have in your library.  watch it regularly and never tire of this
B008Q0DAXK|5.0|f. murray abraham never exceeded the excellence of this performance. everyone is so heightened in this film, and then to celebrate the music. it is such a glorious film, so well cut and directed, and literate. and to have it high definition to watch or listen to whenever is just so exquisite a gift of our technology.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|another great eric clapton concert on dvd. if you like guitars and eric it is a must have for your dvd  library
B0074D3CAQ|1.0|I chose this book to read with a friend (a mini-bookclub) because it was on the Man Booker list and because of the percentage of Amazon readers who rated it 4- or 5-star quality. How could I go wrong? Plus, I have previously enjoyed books of this emotionally-numb-out-of-shape-man-finds-salvation-on-journey genre (Ron McLarty's &#34;The Memory of Running&#34; comes to mind), but this one didn't work for me on any level. The characters are flat, interactions with people along the way -- usually the high points in the &#34;journey&#34; genre -- were uninspired at best and silly at worst. I also found it entirely mystifying why Harold never seemed to gain any training benefit from his daily walks; each day's walk seemed as difficult as the previous one, despite being on the road for over 3 months. As a walker, I was hardly impressed by his overall accomplishment of averaging 7 miles per day, or a little over two hours walking. But worst of all was the author's decision to drop the entire backstory like an avalanche in the final chapters of the book.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very fun game, worth the download, especially if you like hidden object games.  I highly recommend it for all ages.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I couldn't stop watching. I can't wait to see season 3 and hope that more seasons are in the works.
0763644765|5.0|I purchased this for my son when it was 20 months old.  He wasn't ready to potty train quite yet but he'd been showing interest so I figured some potty books wouldn't hurt.  He LOVES this book.  He wants to read it at least 25 times a day.  He loves that it shows where doggie and kitty go to the potty.  I love that the book has simple language and cute graphics.  He really loves the last page, which has an illustration of all different types of underpants and simply says &#34;UNDIES!&#34;
B009JBZH54|5.0|My sons loved, loved, loved this gift.  It went from opening to watching in a matter of 30 seconds while they were having their breakfast and enjoying coffee.
B0002HZLWI|5.0|This is exactly what I hoped it would be.  Beautiful blocks, lots of shapes, velvety smooth sanding, and it included a carrying bag.  Note that these are not the same as unit blocks - these are smaller.  We didn't care, but some people might.<br /><br />Right now my son uses these to build tunnels and buildings for his trains to go through.  Later, when he is more interested in building more intricate structures, we may purchase one of the expansion sets.  But for now this is more than enough.
0765325950|5.0|A perfect end.<br /><br />Are there scenes and dialogue that could have likely been tweaked to more accurately reflect the characters in them? Yes. A few pages out of 908.<br />Does it successfully bring this massive, brillant vision to a satisfying, and sometimes surprising end? Absolutely. And for that, I will be forever thankful.<br /><br />The world is just a slightly better place because of the existence of these books. Enjoy.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|It works great because you do not have to hold it to see movies, etc, or whatever else you use your Kindle for.
B004J64QSI|4.0|I love this 25th Anniversary concert of Les Mis and watch it every time I catch it on PBS.  So, for a corrective emotional experience after watching the disappointing cinematic version, I decided to buy the DVD.  While Alfie Bos and Norm Lewis were still amazing as Valjean and Javert, the low quality video and audio of this non Blu-Ray version was a bit of a let down.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie.  The story was exactly as we expected but that's what we were in the mood for.  Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, and Matthew Lillard all did a great job.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Tony Kushner, the pulitzer prize winning writer of ANGELS IN AMERICA has done it again.  He wrote an absolutely brilliant screenplay about Lincoln.  Ironically, he and director Steven Speilberg had a heck of a time getting Daniel Day-Lewis to play Lincoln, They were even down to saying, \\"Have you ever looked in a mirror?\\" Finally, he agreed and we are certainly the richer for it.  Day-Lewis for all intents and purposes IS Lincoln.  Everything I've ever read about Lincoln, he rolls into this performance from the homespun folksiness, to the country lawyer, to the storyteller, to the grieving father to the husband of a very difficult wife.  Mary Todd Lincoln is likewise impeccably recreated by Sally Field.<br /><br />So many things were unearthed in this film that I never fully appreciated before. Just some of these things follow.<br /><br />How in darkness people lived. Unless it is broad daylight and huge windows are open, everyone indoors lives in relative darkness compared to our electrically lit environs. This set the tone for me more than any other period recreation.  I just can't imagine living in that much darkness.<br /><br />No one is particularly attractive of either sex, despite a huge cast. It took me until the film was over to figure out why they were physically well below average.  It is that our eye has changed.  We have gotten used to people having ample access to cleaning and grooming supplies and aides of every sort. We also have medical attention which helps achieve a healthier glow.  It is not that anyone looks dirty precisely in this.  They just look a great deal scruffier and rougher all over and the man have full facial hair and either fairly ugly hair or wigs. I give Speilberg immense credit for pulling this look off as it really helps the auuthenticity.<br /><br />There were many aspects to the thirteenth amendment passage which I did not fully appreciate before. For example, the man on the street thought that passage of the amendment would bring about the end of the war. The war and the amendment were in fact two separate issues. Lincoln explains the legal problem if we win the war without the amendment though.  He, as commander in chief, will have to lay claim to all of the slaves in the South as the property of the USA as the spoils of war. This will happen because without the amendment, they will be legally considered chattels.<br /><br />The abolitionists were against the amendment because it did not go far enough. They wanted more than full legal equality for the blacks. They wanted to address areas other than the law. Tommy Lee Jones plays their lead person in the House and begins to falter over opposing the amendment as he realizes how many rights he would be giving up for blacks if it fails to pass. The abolitionists in any event were wrong as subsequent civil rights cases in the ensuing 150 years tackled one aspect of life after another where inequality was at play. The thirteenth amendment was critical in these cases.<br /><br />IN SUM THOUGH, let me repeat, Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely phenomenal. It is almost impossible to imagine that anyone could beat him for the Oscar.  It will be his third.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Although I love just about every movie Bruce Willis has made this one was very disapointing and just plain awful.  I turned it off half way through because it was too dumb to keep watching.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good book, I have a little trouble visualizing the descriptions contained in it, probably because I saw the movie first instead of the other way around.
B009MF56GC|1.0|Very primitive and boring Chinese - Hollywood movie. Primitive resemblance of American Hollywood action movies of 90s, like most of today's directed by Chinese with 50% of American actors wanna be Hollywood movies.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Unexpected, smart, full of love. The start seems slow, but the acceleration of emotions and final letter make  it all perfect love story.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It is a great CD, one of my favorite running CDs! Contemporary twist on classic. The piano guys play with a lot of passion and it shows in every note you hear! I higly recomend this CD!
B0012QCZ54|5.0|Ordered this for a gift for someone who loves this series.  Arrived sooner than I thought and the person I bought it for was so excited to get it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Story pulls you in right from the start. Hard to put down. Diabolical ins and outs of a twisted relationship.  Enjoyed it until I got to the ending. Really disappointing.  Wish the author had been as clever with the ending as with the main plot.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great story.  I have read only a few of King's books and was not impressed, so I usually stayed away.  So many of my friends recommended this book that I gave it a try.  I loved it!
B003VDX6N6|5.0|i ran onto this show accidentally, love it, and i am watching the current season on tv now., but it was great to watch it online without the wait.  the instant streaming vids are great, we have a flatscreen & they show beautifully, no hiccuping or pausing or anything, would reccomend to anyone who likes the sci fi (fox mulderish ) type shows... the characters are fun, quirky and have a good love hate rapport, i could go on and on, dont wanna be a spoiler.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|If you liked the first Hangover, you might not like this one as it is not funny or very original.  One and done for me. No desire to re-watch.  I ended up selling this this one to a store that resells movies... it may just sit on their shelves forever :)
B002M7A79S|5.0|would love to see this movie and the series to be re-kindled,  love love love them all especially nathan fillion
B004KZDV8E|3.0|this is the sandly one and memory is locked to 1333 while the ivy one has 1600 plus runs cooler and less the 20 more
B002H3EUA4|5.0|I grew up watching this as did my whole family and now extended family, we used to quote and laugh every Christmas, i bought this for my favorite nephew and his new family so they could have one loll, his wife said he loved it and took it home after family Christmas and watched it immediately.  funny classic movie, and the little things in the tin were fun souvenirs  to have.
B0025KN56E|1.0|I have listened before this outstanding perfomance and decided to order in lp, we keep it from around 2 months without playing from the moment we bought this one and amazing when we played for the first time this unit came completely destroyed unlistened, the records does no have any major scratch but all surfaces seem to be treathed with some kind. Of chemical product and the complete sounds at very low output and severe noise, a complete fraud.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|How can you not love this series?! Hope it will keep going strong and end strong. Cast, costumes, scenery are so satisfying and the ongoing stories are great. I love that today's writers satisfy the audience faster. The days where you as watcher are the only one in the know while the characters have all these hidden conflicts seem to be gone. Hurray. Now I have to only wait till a certain servant gets released from prison and gets to live happily ever after ;-)
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is a nice floors game.  Just the right degree of difficulty.  Recommended if you like this kind of puzzle game.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Interesting and novel plot with good pace and good romantic twist. Pace accelerated and character relationships became burdensome and the hast to complete the story lost touch with even loose reality. Good prose.
1401922732|4.0|Its well made and true to form ,i like using it, mainly its for people who has certain beliefs and believe in angels and am one of them, uplifting, the art is well done but wish the cards were a little smaller.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I have finally found a book that speaks to me at my level of brainstorming.  Great examples of solopreuneurs and partners who've launched successful businesses on very little money, plenty of good advice that cuts through the usual tedious chapters in business books that make my eyes begin to glaze over, and a website where you can find out more.  Have recommended it to so many like-minded people already.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  Heartwarming.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves music and likes good movies.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I downloaded this book and didn't sit my Kindle down until I was finished! I am far from an avid reader, or a reader in general but this soon became an addiction. This book will replace any boyfriend, that's a promise!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Written well being a veteran I could feel what this man was going thru.  The man was simply the best of the best nothing he did he could fail at even though at times it seemed he placed such high goals he would have to fail sometime. Again well written by this author.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book beyond words , I could NOT put it down! I've read & own every book he's written, & this is now one of my favorites. Along with being a wonderful author, he's also very nice in person, I was lucky enough to be part of a meet & greet a few years ago & he was just a delight to meet!!! I would recommend this,or any of his books to everyone,just make sure there are a box of tissues near by ;) !
B00008J2PG|5.0|I saw this movie on the History Channel a long time ago.  This is a wonderful, true story.  And the ending is heartwarming
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie does a great job of showing us how things can change and how we can adapt to these changes no matter how bad it may seem.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Haven't watched it yet but I am sure it will portray JPII very well.  I will try to include that very soon
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Saw this book in an email and thought it looked interesting. My 10 year old son and I read this together and it's his favorite book now. Loved that part of the story is told from main character August Pullman, and part from the supporting characters. Heartwarming story that made me laugh and cry. Highly recommend.
B0016CVN02|5.0|First, a disclosure: I'm not really a Stones fan.  There are a dozen classic rock bands/artists whose music, overall, is more important to me.  That said, there are a few tracks by RS that, for me, are in \\"can't live without\\" category.  And all these songs are on this album: Paint It Black, Under My Thumb, Play With Fire, and of course Satisfaction...<br /><br />Edit: I bought this album as MP3 download.
1438819404|4.0|The Twilight calendars stopped featuring scenes from the movies with this one, and that's kind of disappointing. I searched high and low, but apparently they just aren't available this time around. But since I collect them every year I went ahead and purchased this one. I'm ok with it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 7 & 12 year old kids enjoy this game. Much like Angry Birds, it's a simple game that requires good timing and reflexes. It's also a fun, gentle game with a cute character. Most loved app in our house.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of Stephen King`s best! I had a hard time putting this book down! 11/22/63 is very different from his other books and yet still thrilling.
B004J64QSI|5.0|With such a powerful story, you want the best talent performing Les Miserables, and this is it!  What a great blu-ray quality experience, too, with the powerful voices.
B000MAOLVW|5.0|Best racing movie ever.  Especially for its day it has great racing footage.  James Garner at his best.  It made me a fan of Formula I racing.
B008476HBM|5.0|Pretending to 'rate' such an incomparable classic of great literature as Pride & Prejudice is a pretty pointless exercise, in my opinion.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I really had a hard time putting this down.  It's complex, multi-layered characters and never-dull plot make this a masterpiece.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is one of our favorite Christmas albums, great music!<br />Old favorites as well as new ones.  Have played it daily.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Bad plot line and characters.<br />A horrible waste of time. Don't read it. 2 days of my life wasted.<br />Also a waste of money.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Remembering how desperate a teenager feels is always important. Picoult emphasized this but I found the book filled with cliches.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|To be honest, I read this book to see what all the hype was about. I'm a little disappointed. I feel like the plot was weak. The only thing the book is really about is sex. That pretty much sums it up. . . I have no desire to even read the next one in the series even though this book left me hanging at the end. . .
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is such a great and inspirational movie.  10-year old daughter read the book first and now we are going to do a movie night.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I only recently started reading the Jack Reacher series but have started going back to the beginning and reading the first books. The mystery keeps me guessing until the end. Thanks Lee
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a very interesting account of life after death, and offers mankind the hope that death is not the end. It is also very well written and gives us food for thought about what is really important in this world. Very inspiring! I shared this book with friends and family, and they all agreed that it is an excellent read!
B006B9XZ1K|5.0|I am wonderstruck with this cd. I jus thought that it will get the lyrics of Ours, Superman and If this was a movie lyrics in the booklet. by the way it's excellent.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to order this album after reading the reviews -- people seemed to love this album or hate it.  It's full of wonderful jazz NON-standards.  I was pleased to be introduced to a whole new set of old songs I'd never heard before and I liked the T-Bone touch to the arrangements.  I love the jazz and that it's not &#34;muzak&#34; style smooth.  Melancholy?  Yes.  Interesting?  Totally.  Do I recommend it?  Absolutely.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|I love it. I never thought that I could get it.. thanks for sell this cd. It is pretty awesome :)
0449911357|5.0|Seeing the classic film, now, when it first came to the BIG screen, I finally purchased this original printed book copy much later!  Be aware, though, that the original book version is set up differently than the film classic!!  But I could handle it......
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|I really like the quality of the booklet. It is amazing to have it, It is one of the best Taylor Swift's cds and it cames with the lyrics of all the cds songs.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was the cinematography. The color pallets, sets, and way the scenes were shot were excellent. Not a lot of CGI during action scenes, which I consider a plus. The story line is so-so, I wouldn't consider this as good as I was lead to believe from reviews on Reddit.<br /><br />VERY GRAPHIC, would not recommend for anyone that's squeamish or any children at all. My wife got up and left the room after some intense graphic scenes.<br /><br />The quality of the picture through streaming was great, streamed in HD.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is really great! It works really well on my Kindle Fire HD, no glitches. Totally worth the money!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The beginning of the book was exciting and kept me coming back for more but as it went on it became very predictable. All in all it was a good read. I have to say the ending definitely makes you wonder and I will probably go on to the second just because I am curious.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book! Nicholas Sparks is such an amazing author and that shows in this book as well... if you like other Nicholas Sparks books you will love this one as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book got me from the first pages and had me until the end. I finished in one weekend. I will be read in  the next two in the series right away.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I starred reading this I wasn't in to it and then I just couldn't stop. So glad I finished...really an amazing story!!!
B00ARAO1LC|1.0|Awful movie-don't bother watching this one.  I'd rather take a beating in a dark alley from an ugly woman than watch this movie, again.
B00932AA5G|4.0|Very well-written and acted. I really enjoyed this film. While the protagonist did not have the physical characteristics that are commonly associated with a leading man (a fact the character contends early in the film), he has great stage presence and a range that runs the gamut of human emotions. He's an antihero at best but you become totally enthralled with his plight and share in in his bewilderment as we navigate sharp curves and hidden agendas throughout the course of the film. Overall, not a bad way to spend two hours.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I was able to get to level 10 before I broke down and spent real money. I did again at level 22. I have spent $13 total over the past two months of playing, and am now on level 27. I play about 2-3 cate days per day. That being said, I don't like that I can't use my cafe earnings to buy help. It's not impossible to make progress without more hearts, but I wish there was another way to earn hearts.<br /><br />My kids play as well, under their own profiles, and always with wifi turned off. That's just a given.
030758836X|4.0|Gillian is an expert manipulator. She careful takes her readers in one direction building upon our assumptions and stereotypes only to make a sharp turns just as you think you have the story all figured out.<br /><br />In Gone Girl, Gillian delivers a story full of enough twists and turns to leave you tied up in a knot. I couldn't put the book down because I so wanted to know what was going to happen next and how it all would end. Some people may not like the ending or the constant changing of direction. I did and read the book in less than a day and a half
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Everyone should read this book, my wife died two times and this book helped her to understand what happened to her. When I was 35 I went to a similar beautiful valley, his experience is true.
B005LAII80|4.0|The movie has a great visual style, with a unique use of color. The violence is gruesome and the movie earns its R rating. Karl Urban is great as Dredd. The only problem I had was with Mama, the villain. Lena Headey is given nothing to work with. Otherwise, a very enjoyable movie.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book kept me hooked and  interested where even the personalities of the characters were interesting.<br />Recommend  it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller/mystery.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|I saw this movie 4 times in the theatre and it is one of my favorites.  I'll be watching it many more times now.  Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderfully, funny, sweet.<br />Truly recommended, you'd love Connor and Megan.<br />Nice and easy reading that would catch your breath away.
0307730697|5.0|The amazing book &#34;Fearless,&#34; written by Eric Blehm was an edge-of-seat engrossing drama and deep, well-written story.<br />Find this book for your military enthusiast today
B0023SDPS6|5.0|This is the book that introduced Sheriff Walt Longmire to the world. If you started somwhere else in the saga of the Wyoming law man, you must go back to this one to get your bearings.<br />Craig Johnson creates a believeable universe parallel to ours where the bad guys get their comeuppance and the good guys live to fight another day. The Longmire series is an excellent example of the excellent writing that characterizes much of the contemporary mystery genre.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book and the whole series, I will read it again it was so good.  You must read.
B004L03B3S|5.0|i am gay. so i wanted to see the ddevelopment of the film and how it was going to be as a movie withopu hurting anybody feelings
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the book and the whole series, I will be reading it again and sharing it with other people.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|all the chapters are good, well manage, two handsome guys, brothers of course, love each other in any chapter. i have all season.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I used to buy his books as they came out, then they were mass produced with no substance so I quit buying his books.  Then, I bought the Racketeer and once again, Grisham came thru with one of his &#34;very good stories&#34;
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|What to say.  Well it is what I wanted, hoped it would be, and how could it not be?  Would order again if I need one.  A flash memory card is just that, not sure why I would not be happy.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I would have given it 5stars but keep getting error message when trying to buy bonus content like the Doofenschmirtz levels. when I can do that I willchange it to 5 stars
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Never saw the movie but I gave to my ex's niece.  She loves movies like this so it is sure to please.
B003U9TDII|5.0|The Soundtrack was exceptionally great. I would highly recommend this to any soundtrack fans that enjoy very introspective music .
B00005JLKB|5.0|I love Tom Welling, he is absolutely gorgeous! The show was great and this 1st season is so pure. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Superman, action, thrillers, etc.
1419705849|5.0|My son devours these Wimpy Kid books.  He read this on the day he got it and said it was just as good as the rest!
B008H7HE9S|5.0|Upbeat and catchy tracks. As always, Adam Levine's voice is fantastic.  I enjoy all the songs on the album immensely
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I have never posted a review before .....but this game is really fun!....I cant waite for an update!....If you liked quell you will love this game!
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Too many hypothetical scenarios! Could be better! I should have waited so I would not have to spend money to see this movie
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|loved the movie. i actually did't mean to click purchase with this because the price was high for me. movie great...don't click purchase unless you are certain you want to buy it because there's no turing back.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|loved this game. Its fun and challenging, thanks for having this game free. will recomend to all my friends thanks
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|was a great price and had seen on sic fi channel so was excited to see i could rent it here
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an excellent first book.  I couldn't put it down.  I will definitely read more of this author's books.
B009FZFONO|1.0|the show is amazing an have nothing bad to say about it. amazon however ....when we bought the show it wouldn't play for 20 min. it kept saying we were playing things from amazon on too many devices but we didn't have any other computers up an running at the time. huge let down on amazons part. you pay a lot for a HD episode and then it won't play...not cool.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Who knew you could have so much fun making online bulletin boards? I have stumbled upon the best recipes - I am a collector of sorts - and found the most entertaining blogs.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Really love the whole series; this season does not disappoint. Mny unexpected turns to keep us on our toes! The characters are well developed as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Super fun and very addictive - really makes you think! My husband as well as my 12 year old love it!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Very good game!  The graphics and detail put into this game were great.  There was only one occasion where the game froze but that small hiccup was not enough for me to rate it lower. Thanks for the really cool game.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I watched other people become obsessed - but never thought it would happen to me...WRONG! What is it about killing pigs that brings you so much joy?
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a great book to read bringing in the new year.  It's been a long time since I truly rooted for and cared so much about a person in a book.  Thank you Cheryl Strayed
B00A17AD36|5.0|25 out of 30 songs on these albums are great!  Every song has a message to them - Rolling Stone has already called the Weeknd &#34;the Michael Jackson of our generation.&#34;
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I received this backpack as a Christmas present, and it is awesome!  I just started my own casual photography business, and this is perfect for taking all of my equipment to each session.  It currently holds my Nikon camera, 50mm lens, 18-55mm lens, 55-300mm lens, speedlight, and battery charger, and there's still room for more!  It also has zipper compartments where I can store double AA batteries for my flash or other small items (like maybe keys and a wallet).  This was a great gift!  Love it!
B002VPE1XE|3.0|This case was offered for free with the purchase of a Canon Powershot camera. It is quite large for this particular camera (and probably for most modern digital still cameras). If you are paying money for this case, check carefully to make sure your camera will fit snuggly.<br /><br />The quality of the case is decent, but there are better quality cases in the same price range.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you can get this for free with a purchase, take it. You're bound to find some good use for it. However, I wouldn't pay money for it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Bought this for my bipolar and autistic 12-year old great nephew and he loves it and all music.  It helps calm him down.
B009R8DHAQ|5.0|Funny thing about a crazy guy that gets trapped inside his own home ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I hadn't seen this series when it originally aired, but it had gotten so much buzz that I thought it was time. Now I know what all the discussion was about. Extremely well acted, visually beautiful, interesting story line, sympathetic characters. If you have been living under a rock like I had, it's time to catch up. You won't be sorry!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is by far one of the best books that I have read, ever. The story line, the characters, and the way it was written was simply amazing. This book has all the components of what a good book is supposed to have. It was so good I've read it twice already. I loved every minute of it. This is one story that is guaranteed to stay with you for a long time :)
B0093X805W|5.0|My son could not put this down, he was totally wrapped up in the story.  He has never seen the movie so that will be fun to watch soon.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I like it because it's easy to read and understand and its great if you need to do homework take my advice get the book
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest but this app for Kindle makes me happy. It is easy to use and easy to browse. Get this one.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|The bad: endless advertisements (costs $5 to get rid of ads), not that many levels. Minus one star for that.<br /><br />The good: pretty much everything else. Nice sliding block puzzle game. Not that much of a challenge, aside for a few of the later puzzles, but it's still good casual fun. Excellent game play, sound, graphics.<br /><br />Can't complain too much about a free app. Four stars.
B0094OLJD0|5.0|I can't stop listening to I Am an Ape and I Should Watch TV. The only thing I'm wondering about is what's up with St. Vincent's jaw in the photo.
1451638450|4.0|That's the quote from FORREST GUMP that starts out with, \\"Life's a box of chocolates, you never...\\"  And that's true of a Bujold Vorkosigan series book.  You know it's going to be sweet, delicious, scrumptious and thoroughly enjoyable, but other than that, you have no idea what you're going to get. And ALLIANCE was exactly that. Who'da thunk that the likeable lunk Ivan Vorpatril had it in him to have a real Miles'esque adventure?  And yet, here he does.  Without getting into too many spoilers, Ivan gets himself beat up, shot at, into trouble, out of trouble, back into trouble and back out of trouble while winning the girl under impossible odds.  Miles couldn't have done so well!  Of course, the intensity of an Ivan adventure is much less than the intensity of a Miles adventure, after all it takes a real genius to get yourself head deep into trouble as Miles regularly does.  Ivan is merely really smart and that'll have to do...but it does! Wonderfully!  We find out that underneath that clumsy, unthinking goofball is a man who can and does think, who is not afraid to take a chance...if it is only moderately risky, and who deserves a couple of awards for surviving adolescence in contact with both Miles and Lady Vorpatril.  There are plenty of laughs in this book as well as plenty of serious moments (such as the memorial service attended by Ivan and his mother--and one other--for Padma Vorpatril) to make this book a treat and a surprise.  As Lois McMaster Bujold has shown before, her stories are like a box of chocolates, and delightfully, you never know what you are going to get, except that it will be wild, wonderful, kooky (in a mild sort of way) and utterly entertaining.  I will say that it helps to have read a goodly number of earlier books in the Vorkosigan universe or a number of references will slip by, but even if you have not, you will still enjoy this charming escapade of love, intrigue and romance in a world chock full of possibilities, both good and bad.<br /><br />I wish I could rate this book as a 4.5 because although it is a really good, really fun book, it's not her best, it's not a five star, but it's better than a four. (I think Barrayar would claim the title as her best, followed closely by Shards of Honor.) So I gave it four stars, but that means it's really good and should be snatched up and read at your earliest possible convenience.  Lois does not disappoint!<br /><br />But Lois, as much as I loved this Ivan story, I can't wait until you return to Miles' life to see how he changes after the death of his father.  And a couple more Chalion books would be appreciated as well. Get busy, please!/><br />I wish I could rate this book as a 4.5 because although it is a really good, really fun book, it's not her best, it's not a five star, but it's better than a four.

B009AKI3IM|3.0|I don't know if this is a bad compilation or DJ Shadow isn't as timeless as I hoped. It isn't as good as I remember back in high school.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|After seeing movie found the book kept the intensity of the story going and deepened the experience.  Love Yann Martel's intense descriptive narrative style.
B00973902K|5.0|My daughters love this song!  They like to sing along with it.  I can't wait for her next album, hopefully it will be as good as this.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Always love Ian McEwan and this, his latest novel, is vintage McEwan.  He uses motif of '70s and Mi-5 to get into point of view of story teller.  The inevitable surprise twist comes at the end.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I need more stars!  Oh my, oh my, oh my.... words.  There are so many words I could use to describe how much I loved this book... but all I can think of is phenomenal.  This book just made it to the tippy top of my all-time favorite reads.  I knew it was going to be good because of all the awesome reviews.  But until you experience the emotions...raw, pure, gut-wrenching emotions...of these characters, you just have no idea how good this book is.<br /><br />Sky & Holder...ahhh. A story like no other.  If I were to have another baby and it was a boy, I would name him Holder because I love this character so much.  Just go read it.  You'll see for yourself.
1600597963|3.0|I bought this book for reference purposes only. It would be valuable for beginning beaders, but didn't offer me any new techniques or ideas since I design and complete my bead projects in a freeform style.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|Product was well maintained as this was a used copy that I purchased. No scratches or skips. Would be willing to buy again.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|First off, yes, this is a bait and switch.  When you get slap in the middle of the game it's time to pay to upgrade.  But folks, it is worth every penny! This is such an enjoyable adventure game and it has two twists that I have not seen before: if you grow weary of the hidden object portions, you can skip them by playing a matching card game. Awesome!  And then there is Miles the monkey.  A monkey!! He goes to grab stuff that you can't reach.  Yes, that's right- no more searching for a ladder to reach the shiny object waaaaaaay up there.  Make the monkey do it!  Five stars to this game!  But you must make sure you play the bonus chapter- a happy ending awaits! (Not that kind of happy ending, pervert!) Graphics are amazing and storyline is good.  I definitely recommend this game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What can I say. I am still in love with this story. I was curious about the ending. So glad there is NO BREAK UP, just a NEW TWIST. Onot Book #3!<br /><br />Supermodel C.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Just finished this book today and even though it was really long, I loved it and didn't want it to end. Mr. King really did his research into history for this one. Not your run-of-the-mill Stephen King and I, for one, and glad for this (more plausible?) writing style.
6304712936|1.0|Picture was fine, music was able to be heard but no dialogue. Product returned but had to pay for postage so lost money.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is another great read from Rick Riordan, in keeping with Percy Jackson. For young or young at heart readers a great adventure.  I really like the way Rick blends real life places into his stories, when you have been there and can place the characters from the story.  It's great to point out to the grandkids, and remember what happened to the characters there.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I am very pleased with this watch. It matches the expectations I had from the description. I've already received complements on it.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I chose this because the original movie was so good. Good science fiction requires some element of plausibility. The original had it, this one does not.
B005DOKM9M|1.0|I bought 4 zip sleeve covers.  So far one zipper is broken.  I have to asked my grandchildren about the other 3.  I am very disappointed.  I am returning it.
0143123173|5.0|Having seen the TV version, I thought I knew the story, but the book is different. I recommend it fora good read
B0059XTUB8|5.0|Untold story of one week in the life of Marilyn Monroe.  Extremely well acted......Michelle Williams was excellent as Marilyn.<br />Would recommend.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This story is a masterpiece in so many ways.  A perfect example of existential philosophy.  A great source of examples of commom-sensical approaches to problem solving.  Empathetic character studies.  And, a damn good story.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Good that DeMille is back in the saddle.  Love his irreverence and wise ass comments.  It's a comfortable,<br />amusing, satisfying story.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Everything about this book is simply great. The way the characters are drawn, the action sequences, and considering the length of the book, even the pace of events works well. Mr. Martin is probably my favorite author, and I've been reading for well over sixty years.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|There were a few slow parts to the series, but overall a good read and engaging.  I highly recommend the series.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It was a good book - sometimes the plot slowed, but overall, the story is incredible. I think this would make an excellent study book for a high school or college lit class. Lots of things to think about in this book.
B001706I5I|4.0|Great Movie.  I watched it with my 5 year old grandson and we both enjoyed it.  Jim Carey was superb as usual.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Okay, the idea of the book is good. She can tell a story. However, I think the main character needs a backbone. BIg time. And every other sentence was her 'flushing' or 'blushing' or 'biting her lower lip'. It was annoying. Plus, I was so happy when she yelled at him and kicked him to the curb - but I know she takes him back, which drives me nuts. I guess was just disappointed in the presentation of the female main character - very weak and persuadable.
0394492196|4.0|This version of the John Le Carre classic finishes out the Smiley Trilogy with the same dust jacket cover art, making this the completion to my collection of Smiley novels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|loved it - I actually couldn't put it down. collins is a great story teller and her detailed descriptions of survival skills is vivid and fascinating. the movie was great too.
B003M8NG94|5.0|So close to the holidays & I was a last minute shopper. I truly didn't expect it to arrive before the holidays and it was all my fault, but YIPEE!! It did & thank goodness for my other online ventures were not so lucky. I really appreciated how fast & considerate the shipping was (the product was in a sturdy package). Will purchase from this seller afain
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I liked this CD so much I figured I would give it for a gift.  Loved the music and recommend.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|Great movie...for young the figures are cute and no violence...for older there s real message.  great family movie night selection.
B009SH5JS4|1.0|I ORDERED THE NEW RELEASED BLURAY EDITION AND THERE WAS A VISIBLE DEFECT ON THE DISC AND IT STOPS AT TRACK #2!<br />RETURN IT AND ORDERED A REPLACEMENT, SAME THING!!!<br />BUYERS BE AWARE!
6305433909|4.0|The movie was good and some commedy, but it lacked the excitement and joy of the first sister act.<br />I had seen this movie long back when I was a child, but watching it again just brought memories.<br />Good family movie, would recommand, if wanting an okay movie to watch.<br />Boring in some places, and the rest are just entertaining.
140131046X|3.0|I was not disappointed with the service in any way, but someone in my family read the book and noticed that pages 119-183 were repeated in the book.  So a chunk of the story was missing!  Not sure where I would report this to, as I'm sure more than one of the books would be that way?
B004QX07G4|5.0|Well, I love her show and I just love the person that she is.  She makes me smile without realizing im doing it while im watching her show ... and I found that while I was reading the book... I could actually hear her voice and found myself smiling through it as well.<br /><br />What more could you ask for?

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was the perfect depiction of a high school student trying to fit in. It was beautifully written. I recommend it to everyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great, just great!<br />I really felt I was being pulled into this book. The words just came alive and jumped out at you.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is a solid, no frills action movie. The plot is not hugely innovative or original, but is well executed and, more importantly, acts as a worthy vehicle for Karl Urban's excellent performance as Dredd. If you saw the travesty and that was Sylvester Stallone's 1995 outing and were as disgusted as you OUGHT to have been, then you'll be pleased to hear that Urban's performance in this movie will rinse the bad taste from your mouth.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's an okay game. I just wish they explained things more. Been playing for awhile and I still can't figure out how to do some things. Great thing to pass time with though.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This could've been pretty great, but I feel the opportunity was squandered.  And why is it that every movie set in Boston has to in some way feature Fenway Park?
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Stein did an awesome job capturing the relationship between a human and his pet. I felt like I was reading about my own dog. Very touching.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|McConaughey kills it in this one (pun intended).  It's like a redneck version of Double Idnemity.  One of the best movies I saw all last year.
B0055N0FZM|5.0|Accurate and riveting  details supplied, together with logistics of the building and some pictures made this book real to me.
B00715RI16|3.0|Is this the one with the dog and the little kid?  I don't really remember.  These are the new Saw movies.
0803729227|5.0|Precious book with rhyming verse skillfully illistrated. Charming story with happy ending!  If your child loves whales or snails, they will love this book!
B002RVCD0U|3.0|From what little I remember, it's just ok.  Christian Bale is apparently in it.  Boy these reviews are getting harder and harder to write.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I started reading this because im a big castle fan. As I started reading i found myself picturing each character. The book has little things that tie into the show but for the most part the book does well on its own it has great twist that u dont see coming and great action and hott sex scene<br /><br />Overall I LOVE THIS BOOK
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Need I say more.  Has a high-flying premise, but manages to execute it with aplomb.  See it.
0385535147|5.0|This was not my favorite John Grisham book - but he is still a great story teller.  I have read ALL of his books, I have all of his books (hardback) displayed in a book case in the family room and as soon as his next book goes on sale, I will order it...everyone in my family reads his books as soon as they are available!  If I had to pick a favorite author - it would be John Grisham!  My nine year old grand daughter is an advanced reader and I can't wait until she is old enough for me to &#34;loan&#34; her my John Grisham collection
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|I'm sure everyone has talked about this, but I'm gonna go ahead and say it again:  This movie was Hunger Games before Hunger Games.
B0064W65UM|4.0|A great story, different from the movie for sure. I LOVE the movie, and the themes in it are great. The comic doesn't carry the same themes, but ends with the same weight as the movie and with a vast story that makes you think.
B0030BYWKK|4.0|Great album.  Has a  60's English folk thing going on.  I saw these guys live and there were like 8 of them on stage.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I love this book because I can access it whenever I want to. It was very  useful for when I didn't know a word.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I don't have HBO so I've never seen this show.  I bought this as a gift for my mother who is a huge fantasy fiction fan.  She tells me it's good.
B005CRQ3NY|2.0|I like it it was the awesome book in the world and it was funny for me I love it
B001AT4Y84|3.0|From what I hear this movie was ok.  This is a case where my fiancee likely rented this when I went to bed or something.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time! I cannot wait for the movie to come out  on DVD!! :) Absolutely remarkable, great job Stephen Chbosky!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I've actually never seen this one, but my fiancee really enjoys it.  The cover looks pretty great though, and who doesn't love red-headed moppets?
B000C13Y2S|1.0|I literally broke it opening the package!!  One of the little legs came off - no lens and not very bright anyways.  Saved the batteries and threw in trash.
B004UOE7VA|3.0|In my opinion, the original score for this movie is better than the reconfigured version of it. However, I do like the Adagio of Tron remix
B00AECGQF2|3.0|wish there was more than 4 choices of characters to do things with--I don't understand what some of the things are on the first & second screen
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The reason I really liked this is because we learned what America does to train these people that fight for us and the story really kept me engaged and I'm on 13 years old
6305428042|5.0|Hocus Pokus<br /><br />This is a hokey movie but I love it. Bette Midler is wonderful as the eldest sister of a triangle of sister witches. They return from the dead to finish some witchey business.
B0071NOU78|5.0|My three and five year old sons loved this saber. I wouldn't recommend having an aggressive sword fight with it, but we've had two for a couple months now and they still are great.  And it's a 3 & 5 year old playing with them
B009MO5G90|5.0|I don't get the people who trash these movies. What are they expecting? The RE series has never been about superb storytelling, characterization, and acting. It's about style and excitement! And that's what these movies are: High-octane action movies for guys. Especially their inner 14-year olds.<br /><br />People here spend a lot of time trashing the RE movies, and this movie in particular. Why? It delivers what I've come to expect here. Some awesome action sequences, an interesting (albeit completely nonsensical) storyline, and some really incredible cinematography. What else do you want? I submit that if that's not good enough for you, then you're just watching the wrong kind of movie.<br /><br />Those who trash the story of Resident Evil: Retribution as \\"the worst of the lot\\", or whatever, need to go watch something else. It is what it is. I for one think it is excellent!<br /><br />I like how the storylines of the movies continue from movie to movie, which each one ending in a cliffhanger. You never know what the next movie will bring! Yeah, the story is complete garbage. But that's what's enjoyable about it! Invite a few friends, have a beer, put your brain firmly in the \\"off position\\", and enjoy!<br /><br />And there's a lot to enjoy here. The awesomeness that is Milla Jovovich cannot be denied.  Sure, the character of Alice is weak, and in this movie, she turns into Ripley. But when she's killing zombies with a chain and pistol, it's so awesome I don't care. My brain says, \\"This sucks.\\" My inner 14-year old says, \\"THIS IS AWESOME, DUDE!\\" That's what happens, man. If you want to enjoy it, you just have to surrender to the awesome.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of interesting ideas. I also like that it took a lot of elements from the RE 4 video game, which I loved. Leon Kennedy is here, and so is Ada Wong. They both certainly look the part, although their characterization is actually STRONGER in the video game than in the movie! Here, they're just generic action heroes, but I'm okay with that.<br /><br />Another cool element from RE 4 (the game) was the introduction of the Los Plagues (sp?) virus. A lot of people were confused by the zombie nazi's driving jeeps. But in the context of RE 4, this makes more sense. In that game, a small European village was taken over by the Los Plagues virus. It doesn't turn people into zombies exactly - rather it changes their insides to be like bugs and changes their minds. So they still can operate weapons and such. And some of them were clothed in military style uniforms, same as the game and movie. If you haven't played the game, then this doesn't make so much sense. I thought it was a pretty cool tie-in.<br /><br />Another thing I am really liking about the this movie and also \\"Afterlife\\" is the 3D. The 3D in these movies is really well done. Out of all the 3D movies in my collection, those two movies probably have the best 3D of all, and that's really saying something. Again, it just shows how good these movies are when it comes to the cinematography.<br /><br />So the final verdict? Resident Evil: Retribution is awesome! It is my favorite of all the RE movies so far. Those who say it is \\"the worst\\" just don't know what they're talking about. They're watching the wrong type of movie, expecting the wrong things. I watch these movies with only a few expectations: Excellent fight choreography, excellent cinematography, and an interesting story (that I don't expect will make sense). This movie delivers on ALL THREE of those. And it sets things up nicely for RE 6.<br /><br />So don't listen to the haters. This is not Oscar-worthy material. It doesn't pretend to be. It is a mindless-junk action movie for the mindless-junk action movie lover's soul! And it totally rocks.<br /><br />Peace!
B0074MZSWW|4.0|This first album by Alabama Shakes is fabulous!!!  Her voice is a treasure and I am so glad they have been nominated for Grammy's.  Bless their hearts and bless ours too, but what is that horrible sound way into HOLD ON??  First I thought it was my speaker, so I ripped the cd again and the noise was there again....I bought the mp3 of the HOLD ON song<br /> and the nasty noise was on that too!  All praise to the songs. but has no one else got that problem??  Would have given it 5 stars, except for that screech!!
B001NTJTUY|5.0|Been meaning to get this soundtrack for quite sometime now. Glad to have been able to get it on the cheap too!<br /><br />Rhapsody on the Theme of Paganini has stuck with me for over a decade after seeing the movie for the first time.
B008D1LVRY|5.0|its HELLYEAH! what more do i need to say!<br />if you haven't seen these guys in concert, do so! awesome show!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Not only was this aa amazing story it carried the humor and defiance of a person stranded. The technical approach to each challenge gave it real life tones. Of course the unexpected and failures that plagued him in his bid for survival stressed nothing goes as planned. Loved it and wished there was more as it was a page turner.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|The movie was well executed and I enjoyed the plot but what was simply amazing were the twists that come!  You will think  you have things figures out quickly in the movie, I did but when the movie comes to an end you learn the surprising truth!
087033039X|5.0|You know it's not rocket science, but how on Earth do they make those brades?!  Simple b/w hand-drawn pictures explain each step.  I mention it's black and white but color would not lend a lot to the clarity of the process.  Glad I have it for reference.
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|I was totally impressed with director of this movies and was so happy to learn that it was Madonna who directed and co wrote this movie.  The film is based on the true life love affair of the King of England and Wallace Simpson, a divorce' from America.  Of course we know that he abdicated from the throne and married his love but what this movies turns the spotlight on is just how much Wallace Simpson gave up in life to become his wife.  The story is amazing and their is a fictional character who mirrors the Duchess in current day America that is intertwined flawlessly.  This is a must see for any fan of Madonna as well as anyone with a interest in the Monarchy of Great Britain.  I must admit that I just had to purchase the movie after renting it!  Thanks be to Madonna and long live the Queen!
1451695195|5.0|Very very good book.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the title.  The book also refers to other books I will certainly have to read!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This  book is hard to put aside once you start reading.  It captured my attention with it challenging plot and interesting characters.  I felt in the midst of the events.  Excellent!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Wonderful, I have read all of his books and can't wait for the next one. He keeps you in suspense until the very end.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I already similar product and I love this serie, then wasn't surpresi when I bought this product for my collection
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A great thriller. Keep you in suspense all the way through. I think this is one of his best books.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Adorable, light, fast read....very interestingly written from a dog's perspective, with a lot of humor and feelings...I enjoyed this book alot.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is a great game because you can create a museum of dragons on your own. Also unlike any other games( for example cityville) you don't have energy so you can play it all the time.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|This cover provides the protection needed for handling of your Kindle Fire HD.  When you spend that sum for your Kindle, you need good protection for your investment.  This cover provides that protection in almost all possible handling situations.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Reading this book is not just about Jobs but also about great innovations and all the work and risk to make them acceptable. It is also about life goals and it is really boosting your will to do something with your life. I'm still reading it but I absolutely love it.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. Dan Brown has a way with mysteries of life. After finishing his books I always want to read more about the mystics.
1603427244|5.0|This is an excellent resource book for knitters. It is a great review of various cast on and bind off technigues.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Reading this book felt as if I was watching an episode of Castle, I enjoyed reading this book! I can't wait to read the next one.
B0064IOZY4|5.0|At first I gave this cd 4 stars because it's only 23 minutes long. But I just put it on repeat and listen to it over and over as I take walks or hang out in my home. I must say, along with \\"A Winged Victory for the Sullen\\" (eponymous cd) this is some of the most beautiful and moving music I've ever heard. This makes me wish I could play piano and write like this. How does he do it? Had to change my review to 5 stars because it's just so gorgeous and inspiring. Can't imagine anyone not liking this.
B008FQ0S1W|5.0|I love the song, wish he would release another album.  I also enjoyed the Video, the production is amazing.  His voice is so smooth.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Finally an action movie that is raw, gritty, and in your face! I saw this movie in 3D when it was first released and again on Blu Ray. I loved it both times! The action is fast paced and brutal. The Stallone version is ok for what it is but this version is right on target for fans of the comic.  Karl Urban plays Dredd as the bad ass he is. His Dredd is hard, confident, and in control ( a nice switch from the smiling Stallone adaptation.) I really wish this movie had done better at the box office because I would love to see Dredd kick more ass in another movie!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I Love this sound track and the movie is awesome, It is a very good mix of acapella arrangments, I reccommend this.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for android has come in handy more often than I know. I frequently travel long distances for work. The kindle helps pass the time quickly.
B000OCXI3K|3.0|Good for someone who has some time to read.  It took me a long time to get through mainly because it didn't move fast enough for me.  But overall, good story.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I am already a huge fan of amazon.com, but amazon wireless takes the cake to any other wireless sales provider. I was eager to rid myself of tmobile for years and had my eye on the galaxy note II all fall. I patiently watched the prices for this phone for two months- eagerly waiting for the price to drop. A few weeks before christmas I realized amazon was offering this phone with a new contract for half the price of and other major phone company.<br /><br />I am beyond pleased.<br /><br />YAY amazon!
B005Q1W10A|4.0|The DVD in question was purchased as a gift and I have not seen it but rhe receiver of the item was very happy.

B00479SVBU|2.0|This product fit into my Toyota highlander, but when it played the sound quality was awful. There was a a constant buzzing noise and you could not turn it up loud or there would be more noise. I was very disappointed with this product because it was so highly rated and it should not be.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Not cliche so it kept you intetested til the end of the movie. Acting was good between Clint and Amy
B009GED3HS|5.0|I only purchased the first 4 episodes since I forgot the new season had started and did not want to wait until the entire season was available on Netflix.
0307877523|5.0|Gary Taubes, a nationally recognized scientific writer, has the courage to reveal the truth about what is healthy eating and what is not.  If you have obesity, heart disease or diabetes type 2 and must quit carbohydrate rich foods, I highly recommend the book CARBS Carbohydrate Addiction Recovery Battalion System to start your own support group similar to Alcoholics Anonymous.  If alcoholics can abstain from something they crave and have a wonderful time doing it, so can those people who are addicted to sweets, pastries, and carbohydrate rich foods.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|very surprised and delighted by this product. thought I would be getting something like the soundtrak I bought in 1983.<br />I was wrong. for any bladerunner collector, this is a must have.
B00637D114|4.0|I gave this 4-stars because my 2 boys just love this movie.  It's unusual for them to want to sit still to watch tv, but this movie just captivates them!
6305128952|2.0|I discovered during the holidays that my family had never seen this movie. I ordered this product on Christmas Eve with a promise that it would be delivered by that Friday. In fact, they did not arrive to my family's house until three weeks later! Fortunately, this is the only incident I have had with Amazon, and it was FedEx, not Amazon at fault.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Interesting blend of the real world with the spirit of God.  Enjoyed it and will read it again after I have digested it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|love supernaturals keep making more  shows can't wait for more seen all eight seasons my grandson and i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000957O82|5.0|THIS MOVIE TO ME IS A CLASSIC, NICE FAMILY DRAMA/COMEDY AND THE REST OF THE CAST WAS ALSO GOOD IN THIS MOVIE.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Seth MacFarlane brings his Family Guy-style humor to the big screen.  Clearly if you don't like crudity and some inappropriate awkward jokes, this might not be the flick for you.  Not recommended for kids, but if you are a fan of Seth's than you will be a fan of this movie!
1582701709|3.0|I WANTED THE DVD, I WANT TO KEEP AND GET ANOTHER BOOK TO SEND TO MY SON OVER SEAS. HE ALSO SAW THE DVD.
B0053O89U6|5.0|What can I say.  Everybody has their own opinion of television shows.  I find this series hilarious and really enjoy watching it.<br /><br />My whole family loves this show and we have been watching two to three episodes at a time instead of watching movies.  My kids always get excited when we talk about watching Modern family.  Sometime it is nice just to be able to laugh together as a family.<br /><br />The price was excellent and I am very happy with the purchase.
B003RV43X4|5.0|HOPEFULLY A DUPLICATE WAS NOT ORDERED. NOT SURE WHY THERE ARE 2 CLASH OF THE TITANS IN MY REVIEW I RECEIVED ONLY ONE.
B0058RN85O|5.0|This is basically the same review I wrote for the 3rd season, but the laughs are just as much and the show has been just as enjoyable regardless of which season I watch.<br /><br />Everybody has their own opinion of television shows.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|CHRIS EVANS IS A HUNK, HE DID A GREAT JOB I CAN'T WAIT FOR PART II AND FOR HIM TO RETURN IN THE AVENGERS II. A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE.
B00ATSBIIG|1.0|I have this app on my lap top. Works very well on my lap top, but is very difficult to pick up and move pieces on the kindle.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good Lord, what can Eva and Gideon get into next?? Hopefully Eva gets rid of Corinne for good. A wedding must ensue.
B004RC8NUQ|4.0|This is a great movie to watch. Very funny and very modern. It's a great movie for a date night or just a pick me up.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This was a gift to replace the VHS version we had had for forever but no longer works. Everyone enjoyed it especially during the Christmas time.
B00866JL96|4.0|Nicholas Sparks strikes again with this wonderful love story. I absolutely loved it! Zac Efron does a wonderful job at portraying his character and is very easy on the eyes in this movie.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Bought this as a present for my father and my family. Everyone loves it and we really enjoy the story line, it's a very comical movie!
B00APUQH0W|2.0|This movie was a great idea that never got on base.... It was another predictable baseball movie that wasn't remotely about baseball... It wasn't really about anything. If you're looking for this type of movie done well, rent Moneyball.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|kept waiting and then it ended.  Bear was the star but I am hoping this is his swan song. Oh well
B005LAIISA|5.0|I took my grandkids to the movies to see it.They loved it so much, I ordered it online. they still love it. thank you so much.Mavis
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I have always been mesmerized by a well crafted tale of fantasy and adventure and this was one of th best. The characters and the narrative were as one and the writer threw in a heavy dose of brilliant story telling to keep you enthralled until the last page. I can't wait for the next installment.
0385535147|5.0|Typical Grisham with elaborate plots and lots of detail that sometimes drives you crazy, but good ending. Definitely worth reading if you like Grisham.
B002ZG9968|1.0|This is terrible. Why did they even make it? I love Jennifer's movies and I love Hawaii Five-O but this has got to be the worse either one has ever done.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Ivd tridx several of the hidden object games availabld to kindle and android users. this one is by far one of My favorites. and it is free to boot! its very intriguing and keeps Ones attention. if you have not yet tried it you deffinately should. :D
B005ZMTXMY|3.0|I haven't read a lot of the reviews on this movie, but I'm betting at least one says &#34;They could have made a whole movie just with the first 10 minutes.&#34;<br /><br />Yay, then Mr. Dude and Some Random Kid fly a house to south America. After that, you lose me. It just stops being interesting. My kids only stay for the dogs after that.
B004DM0UII|5.0|My favorite new app for streaming music. I have since gotten rid of Slacker Radio and other music streaming apps.
B003SI3NYG|3.0|This was my tradeoff movie. I got my husband to watch Titanic with me, so he wanted me to watch Gangs of New York. Just didn't really pique my interest. My husband kept having to stop it and explain things to me.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I loved everything on this dvd. Not only have we watched it once, but its been on repeat. All of the extras were amazing as well. It got to me fast and securely. Love it.
B005529EI2|5.0|My husband just adores the LoTR series so I got this for him to watch whenever he wants without messing with all the annoying discs and whatnot. He has to have the extended edition of everything. Can't blame him.
B00340I4KG|5.0|Even though the whole movie is not action, there are a lot of dramatic moments, there is still a lot of action scenes as well. The actors and their acting is very well done and the show was overall very well done, intense, and action packed!
B0051XSKSU|5.0|I like the cast in this one. And it sends a pretty great message. You don't need super powers or special secrets to be the best... just be yourself. I hope kids take that message from this movie.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. I love drawing my own tools to move through the story and creating my characters. This app is just what it says, EPIC!!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I bought this because of the clear case. It works fine. It never scuffed my phone but dirt and other debris does get trapped along the edges. If it was another color I probably wouldn't have noticed. I've gotten compliments on the case. It's a hard smooth plastic that makes it easy to put or take out of pockets. for the price, it's great!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I gave this book five stars because for one I love diary of a wimpy kid books but I have to say this is the most exciting one yet. I would recommend this to all of my friends
1449410243|5.0|Bought this as a present for a friend who owns cats and she loved it. I never saw the product but it seems that it is as advertised. The \\"poems\\" and photos are really funny
B004QX07G4|5.0|I LOVE the book, Seriously, I'm Kidding, by Ellen DeGeneres!  Each chapter is it's own little short story.  Ellen shares her unique perspective on every day things, and it's funny, cleaver and sensitive.  I would recommend the book to anyone looking for a light-hearted escape!
B00338QENI|5.0|Skoot took on a clinical subject and gave it a very personal touch.  She kept her characters real and involved us in their everyday lives as much as possible.
0399534601|5.0|I aboslutely love this!<br /><br />Cannot wait to use it everyday! So much fun!<br />I plan on sharing my findings too!
B007REV4YI|5.0|So, I saw this movie opening night.  I was blown away by everything: the action, the effects, the storyline, the acting, etc. are all incredible.  This is perhaps the best movie I have ever seen, and I am eagerly anticipating its release on Blu-Ray / DVD.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie one to watch again and again loads of laughs Rebel Wilson is hilarious love her humor
B009K0OPQQ|5.0|Once you watch one episode, you're hooked. If you love anything fairytale related or had even a somewhat decent childhood, you will love this show. Jennifer Morrison and Lana Parilla are screen stealers, as well as Robert Carlyle as Rumpelstiltskin.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put the kindle down.  Best love story that I have read in a long time.  Beware once you start you won't stop.  Loved it ......
B0060D16VI|3.0|This is my husband's favorite animated movie. It is a great movie though you are not able to view it through the Apple TV nor can you download it on to a Mac computer that is why I gave it 3 stars.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful. I LOVE IT! Some parts of it were sad and others happy, but I couldn't stop reading! This book is the first book I have ever read that has actually made me cry. The thing was I wasn't just crying for what happened in the book but for what happened to the people in the book. There were many parts where I just couldn't breathe because I had read what had just happened! I loved this book and would recommend it to anybody who reads!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great series. Can't wait to see the next episodes. I would absolutely recommend this series, very action packed and suspenseful
B0044DEAUA|5.0|My son thinks this was a spectacular gift.  He loves it because the reception sound is great and everyone says his voice sounds terrific when he answers.  It is important because it was necessary to comply with the law, and it is excellent because it works so well.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and I watched the free online viewing. Great movie! My daughter and I both read the books.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this story. I don't read very many teen stories, but the reviews on this one were great, so I gave it a try. I'm so glad I did. It's a wonderful story, the characters are so real and their problems emotional.<br />The only problem I had with it was that the font kept changing size. That was very distracting and irritating. Whoever published it needs to redo the formatting to make it easier to read.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My grandchildren and I play this together,its fun and user friendly.Theres many chooses you can make which I really like.
B005CRPB0U|4.0|IT has 5 stories which is a little disappointing but in has  really good stories like babbatty rabity arbitrage the three brothers so I was worth the $6.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|keeps you amused for a bit....<br /><br />but the game ceases to be fun with the small touch screen after the difficulty goes up.
B005LAIISU|5.0|I have one granddaughter that loves anything Ice Age and although she saw this one at the theater, she wanted us to buy it so she could watch it over and over just like all the other Ice Age movies.  It's a nice family movie and the kids really love it.  Highly recommended for all the family!!
B004QL7K70|5.0|I dont usually like teen movies....but this one sure made me laugh.......actually I bought two copiesI dont usually like teen movies....but this one sure made me laugh.......actually I bought two copies
B006GGR5QY|5.0|A wonderful collection of musical charms. I listen to this cd over and over and never tire of it. I believe Olafur is related to the singer Olaf Arnalds, whom I also lov.
B002N14GPE|3.0|The cliff-hanger at the end was dissapointing. Overall it was good. I liked the suspense and the twist in the plot.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I am currently about 80% into Book Two of the Trilogy.  I have really enjoyed how the main characters have changed from the original scenario of her being a submissive.  There is so much more to the story line than just sex;  in fact, sex is really on the back burner in book #2.  The only objection I have is the overuse of the &#34;f&#34; word.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely loved this book was a nice fun and easy read, ended up finishing it in one day...makes you a believer in true love
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Really wish I had not wasted my money on this book.  Had a great plot, but in the end fell flat.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is my favorite show on TV.  It is amazing how well mark Harmon protrays a former Marine. All the characters are great and play off each other like a family.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Horrible and torcher to sit through.  And, oh by the way, it should not have a PG-13 rating.  Watched with our son and was horrified at some of the content for a young man...no wonder we have problems in this world!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I am a Sherlock Holmes fan so I watch almost anything about the character.  I like this program because the actors portraying the characters are good and the chemistry is good between them.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Completely awesome, especially for the price.  We heard things in our ripped music collection that we'd never heard before, even playing it off of  an iPod at 128kps.
B000Q1LCMI|3.0|The book is great.  However, this was represented to be a new book, yet it didn't look new.  i purchased this book as a gift; I already had a copy of my own.  My own copy, which I had read, was cleaner than the one I ordered.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|I used to always play this game on the Internet and I loved it. It is very intertaining and I think my mom loved it Cuz  it kept me busy
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|As  a military wife, this book broke my heart. But it was worth all the tears I put into it. Defiantly a book to read.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|maddening, when you think that this<br /><br />Could actually happen. A really exciting read from the beginning to<br />The end. Loved it
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game! It works without error and moves quickly with easy to read symbols. It's great for a moment of &quot;me time&quot; to clear my head. Thanks for a great FREE game!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves this app.  I paid $2.99 for it but it was worth it.  She has so much fun styling the character's hair!  I like the addition of the curling irons and GROW solution.  I find myself playing it with her at times.
B00005JKOI|5.0|This dvd was used when I bought it, so I was a little leary about the condition it would be in when I got it.  I love the movie Pretty in Pink, so I knew I couldn't go wrong with that and so far I haven't had any problems with it.  It works fine and for the price, it was worth it.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I'm only 1/4 of the way througthis season and I'm loving it!!! So glad I orderd it and I'll do it again!
B005M2V2K8|3.0|I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and thought it was the medium sized one.  However, when I opened the box it was the small sized one so I was disappointed.  It's still cute, but I would have liked it to be bigger.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Excellant season! I order this every year and We so look forward to it at Christmastime. My daughter is always laying in wait for it
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well I really like the computer version but I can't play it on the go so this the hole filler<br />All it needs is caves and bigger words
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love this app!!  helps me plan fun activities and cook real good..<br />I have enjoyed everything I have made through this site
B005VPRET4|5.0|My kids love love love this and so do I! Super cute, but falls apart a lot and it's probably better to glue the cafe together.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|there are 3 games with numereous levels. fun and easy to play. easy to learn and move between ganes,  would like more levels on mineral game
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have not finished it yet, but am having a difficult time putting it down! A MUST read. I was very lucky to get the Kindle Fire for Christmas.<br />I loved this book. It was a bit long, but enjoyed the detail that Mr. King is famous for.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|No sooner did I finish the book, I began to re-read &#34;The Night Circus&#34;.  Even more captivating the second time around.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|once we cracked the region code on our dvd player we had a great time!<br />It's not the book but the film never is.....
B009VL28W2|2.0|I think that &#34;Cunning Stunts&#34; is a much better show.  This show seems to be missing there fire - Kurt's guitar playing seem flat / non-existent.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It was real and honest. It was very easy to get into and hard to put down. I was able to relay to the characters
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|This was a pretty good movie, my only problem was i kept hearing Peter and Meg Griffin but it was just some teddy bear and a hot chick.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is helpful it help me with my math homework and if ur homework said show work the calculator will show u the work
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was unexpectedly entertaining. We rented it on a whim after seeing the good reviews and weren't disappointed. It's along the lines of &#34;Bring It On&#34; and &#34;Mean Girls&#34;...if you liked either of those or &#34;Glee&#34;...give it a try.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read a book of this nature. At the beginning I thought I wouldn't' possible be interested. It seemed child like then very dark.<br />I had to read on as it captivated me ...there must be real people, broken people like this.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|arrived on time, box sealed, works fantastic...a lot of extra features and interviews<br />the last in the series and it did not dissapoint
B008M721MS|5.0|that a very good product for comunicate with my family and friends for my life and my hobbies in my city
B0032JTV74|5.0|Its glee!! best television series in a long time...good characters, good music, naya rivera, what more can you ask?<br />arrived on time and it works fantastic
1452110581|4.0|I'm not sure how it went, but it sure is something cute to look at, and my sister, the major cat lover, I'm sure will love it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Play a lot at work when bored.  Good graphics.  Enjoy different levels  and types of deals.  Will continue playing this game at work or at doctors office.
B007P06DJK|5.0|I have always loved this album.  I have an old cassette version that I can no longer listen to.  I recently watched on PBS, the Graceland tour that Paul Simon did in Africa.  I have not gotten the CD/DVD package yet.  Amazon's new AutoZip immediately downloaded the CD to my cloud drive so I can listen to it before receiving the CD.  I am looking forward to the DVD as I watched it on PBS too.  It's great music, plain and simple.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|It was an amazing book that held action, suspense, and romance. I recommend this book for anyone who likes these attributes.
B007RI56NY|5.0|This CD had a couple songs on it that I liked.  For the price, I purchased the whole CD.  After listening to it, I liked a lot more songs then originally thought.  I wish Amazon's preview of songs was longer then 30 seconds.  Thirty seconds doesn't give a true feeling of the song.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It only gets 4 stars though because of some little things. I know I'm not citing those little things but they're there and I was going to give it 4.5 stars but I didn't have that option.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I have always been a fan of &#34;Star Trek&#34;.  I purchased the DVD and have not received it yet.  Amazon's new AutoRip downloaded this movie to my cloud drive so I could watch it immediately at no extra charge.  AutoRip is a great new Amazon feature.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|It's ok for free game of course to get good gear you have to spend money. It's takes forever to upgrade gear to if you want it now cost you to.
1449415881|5.0|What can I say;.  It's Dilbert! and Wally, Catbert, Dogbert, Alice, Ted, Asok, PHB, etc.  If they can't get you laughing, check to if you're dead.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This was different than all other similar apps.  High quality - Doesn't lock up my phone - Extremely relaxing to play with.  My 14 yr old daughter was having trouble sleeping, so i had her play with the app for 10-15 min then rubbed her back.  She settled down and was asleep within minutes.  GREAT JOB DEVS!  Ill keep this one for a long time! Droid Razzr Maxx
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I enjoyed playing chess as a kid with my dad.  And now that our oldest is learning in school she has taken over this app on my Kindle Fire.
0156012197|3.0|This is a great quick introduction to Saint-Exupery's writing. I think this book is great to give to a 14-18 year old and to discuss over dinner as an introduction to adult life and higher thought.<br /><br />But if you really want to digest some amazing writing, check out my review of \\"Airman's Odyssey\\".
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I was expecting so much more that what there really is.  I didn't want to use any money so I found it irritating.
B00820N2JG|3.0|The South Park guys are genius IMO and this seemed to me to be their big foray into current events satire.<br /><br />Quite a number of classic scenes, songs, and lines...and wow, the things they do with marionettes.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I found this game a bit tougher than the real thing.  I would get frustrated with all the bouncing off the coins did.
B004T340QY|3.0|I personally dislike Clooney, but he's a great actor and he accels at these types of movies. Turturro and the rest of the cast are fantastic, and reading about the parallels to Homer's Odyssey is interesting.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I had to play this game for another game that I was playing.  I found it too time consuming for me.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|No its not a healthy relationship by any standards but books are meant for entertainment and to get lost in them/fantasize. The writing was great and you couldn't help but to picture yourself in the characters role. I am glad that my friend recommended it. Read it in 2 days after staying up all night the 2nd lol. can't wait for Walking Disaster and to see how they do the movie for Beautiful Disaster.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|My kids enjoyed the game.  It was frustrating for them at times, but once they got the hang of it, they had fun with it
B00723NWJE|1.0|Neither my husband nor I liked anything on this CD.  It doesn't sound like her.  She must be into new stuff.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Not the best book I've read but it definatley wasn't lacking a twisted plot! Just when you think you've got it all figured out BOOM, you're blind sided with it. Like I said not my fave but it is worth the time to read it.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|But I'm not.  Not crazy about this CD.  Just not for me.  Not jazzy like her other cds.  But won't give up on this doll.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|after getting the program loaded into my laptop it works well, just not quite as close to exacty right as  orginal one
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is awesome. Combat is fun. Fusion adds to the game and replay value if you are somewhat of a collector like myself. Not to mention the multiple endings. I would recommend this to any JRPG fan. Tons to do and will keep you engaged for quite some time.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Great story and animation.  My entire family of six enjoyed the movie.  It is one of those movies that we will enjoy seeing again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is way better than it used to be!  yeah for the pinterest app! I use this all the time now
B00AE2J93I|1.0|Rented this to watch with my children and ended up cutting it off. We did finish the movie later without the children. I was absolutely disgusted that somebody could promote this as a kids movie. One of the first things out of the main characters mouth was that he is watching \\"sex and violence\\" on tv.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book will draw you in from the beginning.  Once you start having feelings for that little Irish girl, turned slave girl, you want to follow her life.  How she fits in with the slaves, how the other white people treat her, and her thoughts about it all.  The story has different narrators, which adds to the reader knowing how things were perceived from either side (slaves/whites).<br />The writing is great, lots of research to get the slave dialect right, I'm sure.<br />Loved this book!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like the fact that it lets you know if you have sufficient power or if you need a charge.
B00574P9EQ|3.0|It was an okay movie, but I found the first one to be a lot funnier.  The bonding between the brothers was nice, and the mom's way of making it happen was different.  I'd recommend it to watch, especially if you saw the first and don't like missing sequels  but couldn't recommend it to purchase.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a fun story! For the most part, the writer avoides being too explicit with intimacies. A nice twist.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|The movie is awesome and the bonus features are more enjoyable then I've seen on alot of other movies in my collection.<br /><br />Quality of the blu-ray is awesome.<br /><br />The story is great and everyone i'm sure has read about it already, but to add on to anything you may have read you will get involved in the characters and have ones that  you are pulling for through the whole movie.  Everytime I watch the movie I wish they would put out a sequel, because it's just that great your going to want more at the end.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
B004HD61KE|5.0|when i read the sample of this book my thoghts about it was that it was pretty shocking as well as horrified.
1577314808|5.0|They say &#34;When the student is ready, the teacher will appear/arrive&#34;. Well, I have been reading like material for 40 yrs and when my adoring wife gave me this book it was like a Epifinry. Have read all his books and continue to almost daily. Thanks to Echard for being traumatized to the point of conscience awakening and the sharing that ensued.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Different but has the piggies from AB games.  Goes from easy to hard levels as you advance.  Which is perfect as you learn as you go.  4 year old grandson loves this games and since one has to design and build the cart it makes him think and look at the items he has to work with and put together in order to defeat that level.  So it works both your mind but eyes.  Just remember to set time limits for kids as one needs to explore the real world also!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|we rec'd $40.00 in charges with this game as my 10 year old didn't read the fine print of &#34;purchasing&#34; more coins.  Not happy.  We deleted the app and have told others to watch out for it
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I enjoyed the authors honesty and insights as she hikes the PCT and looks back upon her life; what her life was, is, and could be when she reaches the end of the journey. Read this for my book club and think the discussion will be riveting.
0765325950|5.0|I had a smile on my face through all 900 pages of this book. What a brilliant end to a series that has provided a lot of quality entertainment! It was a heck of a good time.<br /><br />Many of these reviews will quibble about some discrepancies and plot lines that received short shrift. While that may be true, I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book this much. Well done, Mr. Jordan and Mr. Sanderson. Well done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my brother  and I love minecraft! its better than lop (laughing out of pants)! I can be creative and design my own with unlimited supplies, or I can fend my own against dangerous creepers,  zombies, and other ferocious creatures!
1609613937|5.0|WOW, I have been a vegan for 5 years but this book fundamentaly changed the way I eat! Thank you Dr. McDougall
B00A8ECU24|3.0|so this game is really fun but I just got to rareity and I see the price WHAT THE HECK I don't have that much money I really think hasbro has some work to do and I cant get the cutie mark crusaters because of what I need I cant add friends and sweetey bell is just as bad as rareity I wish I could give it more stars but I just cant
B00846REIS|1.0|This book is too predictable. It is too close to 50 shades of gray yet doesn't give you that feeling of fantasy. This is not how I would ever dream to be treated. It's too blunt-straight forward. It is hard to connect with the characters emotionally. It goes from one extreme to the other leaving you feeling...REALLY?...What the heck was that about?! I will not be reading the next in line.
B00AOOIIVA|1.0|I wish I hadn't bought this, but now i own it.  Kids were not interested in the movie at all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Even though this was a little far out with the SM however this was an awesome story that kept me wanting more. I felt for both characters, loved the ending! This is fantasy! I would love to see the movie if ever they came out with it!!
B004DM0UII|5.0|I really love this app.  Im a christian and sometimes its hard to find a variety of music. Not on this app! Great variety for the adventurous music lover.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|There are a number of tracks which are very good on this album. I'd originally planned on cherry picking songs but it was on sale and would have been the same price as just getting the individual songs.
1449433251|5.0|Hours of entertaining reading for the entire family.  Children will try to determine who they are most like, Calvin or Hobbes.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Jo Go is the man. Willis amazingly spot on. Can u say cult classic? I want more Looper movies from this director.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|My 13 year old granddaughter received this for Christmas. Had to put our hands over our ears when she opened it up....lots of screaming.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I had two reservations about this movie. One was the acting of Ben Affleck after I had seen him in \\"Changing Lanes\\" and two, \\"based on true events,\\" which essentially means they used a real story to make their own story.<br /><br />The \\"story\\" starts out with the American Embassy being overrun by a mob in 1979. Six diplomats escape and hide in the Canadian Embassy while talking heads in the State Department at Foggy Bottom try to figure a way to extract them. Enter Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, a CIA agent, who hatches a scheme to go into Iran under the guise of a Canadian crew looking for locations to shoot a sci-fi film. It has to be realistic so he seeks out a costume and make-up designer played by John Goodman with whom Mendez had a real life friendship. They manage to enlist the aid of a Hollywood producer played by Allan Arkin. They also need press, so they throw a party for their movie, Argo. It gets written up in Variety.<br /><br />Armed with magazine articles, cartoons, phony biographies, business cards and a fake Canadian passport, he spirits his way into Iran and to the Canadian ambassador's residence. We see photos of citizens not true to the revolution being hung from crane equipment and in other modes of terminated wellness conditions. This is to build the suspense along with the one diplomat who doesn't like the idea and he gives the audience the impression of the one who will blow it if anyone does.<br /><br />Using a VW microbus they scout the streets of Tehran in their roles. They drive their way slowly through a march in the streets and past the screams of citizens who all seem to have had aspirins with \\"Cafe Loco\\" chasers of the strongest bean. When they get to the airport, all airport staff from customs inspectors to local revolutionary enforcers licensed to kill, seem to be in suspicion lock-down mode, as if they can sniff out any American behind a Canadian passport. The drama heightens here, and the whole airport scene is what is created \\"based on true events.\\" I suspect it is the same when the American government decided to nix the operation which will practically guarantee the capture of her citizens and blow the operation in progress.<br /><br />One reviewer describes the adverse Canadian reaction to this picture, which places them in a minor role when they had a much more pivotal one.  He describes the Canadian ambassador appearing as nothing more than an innkeeper. Actually it appeared as a very nice Bed n' Breakfast-Lunch-and-Dinner, eh?<br /><br />The good news was that Affleck's acting seems to have matured. He creates a taut and gripping film thanks to his direction, cast and license that \\"it's based on true events.\\" John Goodman's performance is subtle where Allan Arkin is better at being prickly--\\"Argo (blank) yourself!\\" he says. It became the challenge and password of the film. The beginning of the film provides an essential \\"docu-background\\" of historical events that led to seizure of the embassy.<br /><br />You argo see it.on true events.\\" I suspect it is the same when the American government decided to nix the operation which will practically guarantee the capture of her citizens and blow the operation in progress.<br /><br />One reviewer describes the adverse Canadian reaction to this picture, which places them in a minor role when they had a much more pivotal one.

0143106651|5.0|Needed to find a book for a 13 year old that didn't have any violence or strong sexual connotations yet would interest a teenager and would perhaps provide some lessons on life. This book does it. Well written and can still be enjoyed by the present day teen.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great graphics, hours of fun. Great mystery solving puzzle. Love the hidden objects games. Game that makes you think and use your brain while having loads of fun doing it.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|anyone that likes this developers work will like this game. quirky, smart, and entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys puzzle games.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked the basis of the book.  It is hard to put down once started.  I wouldn't recommend it for somebody who doesn't like intimacy details.
B002RVCD0U|3.0|This movie was okay - not as good as the Arnold S. movies with better special effects and story lines.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina fey has a hilarious way of making life seem a little less serious, while providing a behind-the-scenes look at chauvinism within show business.
0385535139|5.0|I am a True John Grisham fan, and I Have all of his books. Grisham never dissappoints with his story telling of Legal thrillers, and I am quite certain that this one too is for the record books.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This games is the best ! We recently introduced it to our friends and they now they host Settlers nights at their house.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I loved this movie so much that I finally purchased it as part of my collection.avatar broke all bounds in the technology of movie making, of special effects and computer animation. It is a well worth movie to watch and to collect.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Definitely keeps your interest.  Feel like a friend moved away now that I've finished all 3 books in the trilogy and want to know wht happens to Lizbeth next.
B008D30K7E|5.0|A very amusing story, full of twists and turns you never know who will appear next, excellent read highly recommended
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book has a great message for readers of all ages. I enjoyed it very much and would suggest it to anyone feeling a little down or just looking for a good quick read.
B008GAXUGW|4.0|What have we here? A \\"comprehensive box set\\" as promised by the hype on the container? Well, to be precise:<br />CD 1-2 Symphonies, G 515, 517-522 (Michael Erleben, New Berlin Chamber Orchestra, 1993)<br />CD 3-5 Cello Concertos, G 474-483, 573, E-flat major G deest (Enrico Bronzi, Accademia i filarmonici di Verona, 2005)<br />CD 6 String Sextets, Op. 23, no. 1, 3, 4, 6; G 454, 456, 457, 459 (Mayumi Seiler and others, 1991)<br />CD 7 Oboe Quintets, Op. 55, G 431-436 (Lajos Lencs&eacute;s, Parisli Quartet, 1992)<br />CD 8-9 Guitar Quintets, G 445-450, 453 (Eros Roselli, La Magnifica Comunit&agrave;, 2005)<br />CD 10-13 Piano Quintets, Op. 56-57; G 407-418 (Ilario Gregoletto, Ensemble Claviere, 2005)<br />CD 14-29 String Quintets, Op. 10, 11, 13, 18, 20, 25, 27, 28 (all with second cello), 39 (with bass); G 265-312, 337-339 (La Magnifica Comunit&agrave;, 2006-2011)<br />CD 30 String Quartets, G 248, 177, 194, 213 (Petersen Quartet, 1991)<br />CD 31 Sonatas for Piano and Violin, Op. 5; G 25-30 (Enrico Gatti, Franco Angelini, 1991)<br />CD 32 Sonatas for Piano, Violin, and Cello, G 143-148 (Galimathias Musicum, 1991)<br />CD 33-36 Sonatas for Cello, G 1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4a, 4b, 5-18, 565a, 565b, 566, E-flat major, G major, and D major G deest (Luigi Puxeddu and others, 2009; G 18 played on viola)<br />CD 37 Stabat Mater, 1781 version, G 532 (Barbara Vignudelli, soprano; Flavio Emilio Scogna, Orchestra da Camera \\"Benedetto Marcello,\\" 2005)<br />In other words, a somewhat haphazard assortment of relatively recent European performances, mostly on period instruments, that Brilliant Classics was able to license.<br />  The symphonies here are the last quarter of Boccherini's output, composed for Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia in 1786-1792, showing remarkably little influence from the Haydn symphonies that saturated musical circles in Spain as thoroughly as they did those in the rest of Europe. The cello concertos, cello sonatas, and piano quintets are essentially complete, and only one guitar quintet is missing. As the guitar quintets are all arrangements Boccherini made for a noble amateur, the Marquis of Benavente (the notes in the box confuse him with the far richer Duke of Osuna y Benavente, who would have surely rated original compositions), some of the music occurs again elsewhere in the set, mostly in the piano quintets. The string quintets with two cellos constitute the first half of Boccherini's production in his favorite genre, dating from the 1770s. While Boccherini composed a significant amount of vocal music, it was not his forte; the Stabat Mater is his best-known vocal work and the best choice to represent that side of him. On the other hand, it is disconcerting to find only four of Boccherini's ninety-odd string quartets in this set. The forty-plus string trios are completely missing, as are the ten or twelve quintets with viola, and the considerable number of pieces for mixed ensembles of strings and winds are represented only by the oboe quintets. In short, if you like this music, this is not all the Boccherini you'll ever need. On the other hand, it's a great value. I've dashed this review off quickly so you can have a list of the contents and I've only listened to a fraction of the set, but so far I'm pleased.nly one guitar quintet is missing. As the guitar quintets are all arrangements Boccherini made for a noble amateur, the Marquis of Benavente (the notes in the box confuse him with the far richer Duke of Osuna y Benavente, who would have surely rated original compositions), some of the music occurs again elsewhere in the set, mostly in the piano quintets. The string quintets with two cellos constitute the first half of Boccherini's production in his favorite genre, dating from the 1770s. While Boccherini composed a significant amount of vocal music, it was not his forte; the Stabat Mater is his best-known vocal work and the best choice to represent that side of him. On the other hand, it is disconcerting to find only four of Boccherini's ninety-odd string quartets in this set. The forty-plus string trios are completely missing, as are the ten or twelve quintets with viola, and the considerable number of pieces for mixed ensembles of strings and winds are represented only by the oboe quintets. In short, if you like this music, this is not all the Boccherini you'll ever need. On the other hand, it's a great value.

B004GCPJDQ|4.0|Don't read into the other reviews saying this is difficult to install, I got it in there first try and it's been charging ever since. My only issue is that the rechargable battery is a different voltage than the AA it usually takes so even on a full charge it reads about 60%. Not that big of a deal, just a small quirk.
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham is one of the best American writers writing in today's times.  In The Racketter, he keeps the pace going, and keeps the reader guessing and on edge to know what is going to happen.

0061186473|3.0|I don't have much to say about this, I normally love everything Gaiman writes, but this collection was pretty flat.  Unfortunately, if you are a huge Gaiman fan like me and own most of his works, you will already have half this book, that is to say, 'Troll Bridge', 'How to Talk to Girls at Parties', 'The Witches Headstone' and 'Instructions' are all published in other books. The rest of the short stories are just ok, but the big problem I had specifically with this collection, was that I bought this with the intention of reading it to my daughter, who loves books like Coraline, Instructions, Wolves in the Walls, etc., but most of the stories in this collection either had an inappropriate theme for her, OR they just didn't hold her attention.  Every author is entitled to a few bad novels, and if this is the worst Gaiman has to offer, then its still much better than most.

0525953728|5.0|I read the entire thing in one session. Could not put it down. It's not the greatest book nor a masterpiece, but it is very interesting and kept me glued. The writing style almost gives the feeling of sitting in a bar and having the author share his war-stories.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I was not impressed by the TV ads for this movie! However, when my 10-year old granddaughter gave me a verbal book report, she shed new light on its significance.  Order the trilogy and watch the movie!

B002RI9HUM|5.0|Great story - Author had unusual slant on telling the tale of drug addiction. The way she told the story from inside Rachels head -if only we could see ourselves as others see us - and her version of &#34;only having a good time&#34;. Loved the characters.  Couldn't wait to see what happend next in the story.  Did laugh and did cry - Marian Keyes is a great storyteller.

B000SEIK2S|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I can see why other reviews mention this book is similar to Starship Troopers, but it is a distinct work with some really need plot elements and technologies.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and immediately read the second book (Ghost Brigades), also awesome, and I'm now reading the third book, The Last Colony.

B00275EGWY|5.0|I have more family in the military than I know what to do with. One of which was an IED for years. So this movie really hit home with me. It's hard to watch at times, but it's very well written, directed and played out. This is why I plan on getting a degree in psychology. I've been listening to stories like this my whole life. I guarantee every actor & crew member on this movie has some degree of PTSD.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I paid for the .99 version so my daughter could play it. It gets to the play menu then restarts when you hit play over and over again. It may just be my phone although its less than a month old and every other app I have works fine. Also can't find a way to refunded for this.

B001A4LYN2|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis is remarkable, yet again, in the role of Daniel Plainview. The way he can use his voice as a tool to portray a character's essence is spectacular, and he actually makes you garner some sympathy for an otherwise despicable character.  Paul Dano also is an impressive nemesis for Plainview, and this family business story is stirring throughout.
B004QSQML8|5.0|In my opinion this movie was way underrated and is one if the Best movies Ridley Scott ever directed! Tim Curry is Amazing as the Devil himself in this awe inspiring cinematographic Masterpiece!
B0044WZN9I|4.0|It's a hood movie to see, but it's fairly predictable. It's defiantly worth watching, but it is completely unacurate since it is nearly impossible to get stranded on the lift because of all the different safety procedures that are followed.

1400052173|4.0|Coming from a business background, the business discussion of medicine within the main story of the science of HeLa cells, and the drama played out not only with Henrietta, but also with her family and relatives was well woven.<br /><br />The author brought out the person of Henrietta, which is unknown to the majority of medical students who work with the science, but have only learned of \\"HeLa\\" from text books.  And, most likely, Henrietta is completely unknown to the population who have benefited from the learnings which are the product of the science of the cells.<br /><br />I give great credit to the author for her dedication to bring Henrietta back to life, to give credit for a major contribution to science.  And, also to bring a new understanding for how a part of the medical world actually works.

083205416X|5.0|I finished this book in November 2012 and so unfortunately some of my relevant first impressions have faded away. However, I will agree with the other Amazon reviewer of this product that the novel does start slowly -- But eventually gathers steam and in doing so becomes a page-turner. &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; is one of those books that I could not wait to get back to once I'd put it down. It is an age old story that shows how history repeats itself in the way that mankind takes advantage of its fellow humans. Throughout the ages and once again in this tale, wars have been started / are started over property. And here in GOW -- the Okies are driven off their land by ruthless profiteers. All manner of guises of moral superiority come into play so that this exploitation can take place -- via crooked cops, &#34;Commie&#34; haters, greedy bankers and just &#34;the plain old ignorant&#34;.<br /><br />I had always loved the film version of &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; (1940) before reading this novel, upon which that film is based. However, the movie pales in comparison to the book. While the film effectively samples and highlights many of the novel's main themes and events -- The deeper resonance, desolation and even horror experienced by the Joad clan and the rest of the Okies, as Steinbeck portrayed them, is diminished in the movie. While the film ends on a lighter, more hopeful note (a sugar-coated ending as is often necessitated by Hollywood) -- The question of the Joad family's survival remains in the balance at the end of the book. One doesn't know whether the Joads are at the end of their rope, whether more struggles await them, and / or whether they'll even survive those struggles.<br /><br />That being said -- Even at the end of the novel, by way of Steinbeck's poignant imagery, there is a sliver of hope, a silver lining -- That tells the reader this: No matter how little we think we have to give, we will always have something more to offer, should we choose to dig deep down -- The resources will be there. It is this kind of thinking that helps the Joad clan to survive throughout the entire saga. &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; confronts the harsh, bitter reality of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression -- Wherein dreams are deferred and sacrifice becomes a way of everyday life.<br /><br />Stephen C. Bird, Author of &#34;Any Resemblance To A Coincidence Is Accidental&#34;-- The resources will be there.

0765325950|4.0|I will start out with saying that anyone as devout as I have been to this series will be somewhat bias in the review.<br />I have not been to Jordancon nor am I a a daily blogger on Dragonmount (good site though, check it out). But I have read many of the books at least 5 times and I  do have a son named after one of the characters in this series so I was glad to see that that character stayed strong (Go Perrin!)<br /><br />This book was a true page turner for me and not just because of the way it was written, I wanted to see the END! So I will go back to where I left off midway through Lord of Chaos and continue on at a very leisurely pace and just enjoy it. I will be disappointed of coarse reading plot lines that never quiet go anywhere as well as other annoyances but hey how can any author(s) please everyone for 14 books on every story line?! I always felt that the series could have been cut by 3 or 4 books but I digress, this is about MOL.<br />Overall I walked away satisfied, exhausted and a little teary eyed. Now how can a one, two or three star book do that?<br />Matt was awesome as was several other characters new and old. Lots of blood and guts, a bit of new romance, plot twists, new enemies and weapons, new and clever stategies with the one power, intriguing politics and unexpected deaths. More in this book than books 8-11 put together. This book had surprises for me, gut wrenching surprises (almost like when Gage died in Pet Cemetery gut wrenching.)<br />Now for the not so good. Too much battle for my taste (and I do have a large appetite for that), missing plot lines and Brandon  Sanderson is a bit abrupt finishing other plot lines. I really, really, really wanted more epilogue!<br /><br />Now for my take on the ebook release. I wish they could have come out with the ebook at the same time as hardcover as I don't feel it would have changed sales. Many of the arguments on here claim that hardcover books are dead but I do hope the hardcover never goes away completely. Harriet is at least 70 now so perhaps that is what she also fears. Please review this book on what is inside it. When Harriet and Brandon signed my son's book (Run free Wolf Brother), and told him how happy they were to meet him, it was something we will never likely forget. How could have that happened with an ebook?<br /><br />Suravye ninto manshima taishite!<br />Peace favor your sword!completely. Harriet is at least 70 now so perhaps that is what she also fears.

B0000DJZ8R|4.0|I saw this film before having read John Steinbeck's novel upon which it is based.  And I had always liked this movie.  Then I read the book and was completely absorbed and deeply affected by it.  Although the film makes a bold attempt to convey how tough life was for the Dust Bowl Okies during the Great Depression -- Ultimately this picture is sugarcoated compared to the novel.  The book is darker and grittier than the film.  At the end of the picture, things are looking up for the Joad clan -- The family chats hopefully as they drive along in their jalopy towards the work that awaits them.  Whereas at the end of the novel -- The Joad family's chances for survival are looking grim and their future is questionable -- Although a sliver of hope resonates within Steinbeck's poignant final image.<br /><br />This film samples highlights from the book effectively enough to keep the momentum going -- And the performances by Jane Darwell, Henry Fonda and John Carradine make up for whatever had to be left out of the script.  Matriarch Ma Joad is the role that Darwell was born to play -- She won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1941 for her portrayal.  Best Actor Oscar-nominee Fonda finds a good balance between tough and compassionate in his portrayal of Tom Joad.  John Carradine is memorable as Casy the ill-fated preacher.  It is also noteworthy that John Ford won a Best Director Oscar in 1941 for &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34;.  Yet another highlight of the film is Gregg Toland's top-notch cinematography -- That I had taken for granted during previous viewings of this picture.  In closing -- In 1989 (according to Wikipedia) -- &#34;..... this film was one of the first 25 films to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.' &#34;<br /><br />Stephen C.

B000SGRONM|5.0|I read this short book every Christmas season and laugh aloud every year! These stories are about more than a holiday. They are about developing an identity, the true meaning of etiquette and more.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a fast read. Cute and adorable. It had some things in it that I did not anticipate, usually with these types of books ya can guess what is going to happen but this one had a few good surprises.
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|This film is mildly scary, but the plot is ill-conceived. The characters do not have realistic responses to the events.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Why not include a help or tutorial feature? I tend to enjoy games more if I know how to play them.  Total waste of money for newbies.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I almost think I like Jeremy Renner's character better than Jason Bourne. Aaron Cross seems to know what he's doing and why, so we don't have always the undercurrent of searching for his true identity. The action scenes and chase scenes in this one are exciting. All in all, it's a good addition to the &#34;Bourne saga&#34;. I hope to see more of Aaron Cross in the future!
0767824571|5.0|Imagine for a moment... 14 year boy being invited over to his best friend's house because the best friend discovered there, hidden behind the other albums a handful of Monty Python records. Oh it was pure evil and fun!!  Then the movie, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, came to America.  We as kids watched it over and over and over again reciting line by line the adventures of King Aurthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Not only were exposed to some whacked out history lesson, but was indoctrinated into a different of kind of superior humor...British humor.  Our parent's disowned us, our school teachers were taunted by it, and we clamored to find two coconut halves to bang together.<br /><br />Oh yes, review the product. Great movie!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Having already owned Batman Begins on standard DVD and the Dark Knight on Bluray, it wasn't such an obvious choice to buy the entire box set for the third film. However, the price at the time was only a few dollars more than the third movie alone (about $28). For that price it was definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those looking for the \\"complete\\" box set with all the trimmings you should probably wait for the later release set to come out this year. Or better yet, simply never buy any box set because there is always a better one around the corner. For someone who only wants the movies on Bluray, this is a great purchase even if you own some of the other films. I re-gifted my old copy of the Dark Knight.<br /><br />The box is a good quality, sturdy cardboard that is actually a little unforgiving in terms of getting the movies out. I'm hoping that loosens up some in time. The movies themselves are a decent transfer with variable aspect ratios (IMAX and non-IMAX scenes). The art book is nice as well.<br /><br />It looks great on a shelf, the movies are top notch, and the price was unbelievable.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|It was for my grandson for Christmas.  He loved it.  Great Price. It was in a nice case.  Came on the day it was scheduled.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|...this book will have you thanking your lucky stars for having them.  Messed up protagonist, messed up family, messed up town.  And the cute detective was a disappointment in the end.<br /><br />I really wish that there were a 3.5 star rating.  That's what I would give it.  The narrative was way too clipped at the beginning, but got much better as the book went on.  If this was intended to be a realistic crime mystery, I don't know...  Some of the characters were just too over the top.  I knew who it was fairly early on and at one point considered just skipping to the end because some of the action was getting boring.  But there are some unexpected twists, so it was worth reading through.<br /><br />One thing I especially didn't like was the number of times the action was propelled forward by having Camille, the protagonist, do something for no explainable reason.  She would even say so - she didn't know why she did something, or she let something happen to her that she wouldn't normally, or she was too tired to resist, etc.<br /><br />A fairly fast read.  The narrative has an attitude, which is enjoyable.  The subject matter is a little disturbing.  The characters are extremely disturbing.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. liked it very much very well made. Good continuance from the other Batman movie made by Christian Bale
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|there is really just not any fun to be had with this game - pictures of items to build are much too difficult to reproduce with the legos provided in the &#34;game&#34; one might like it if they are a master lego builder -
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Homeland is an action packed thriller that is filled to the brim with unexpected twists as turns that will surely keep you attached to the characters as well as the story through out.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyabale! So refreshingly written while providing a very informative insight into the occupation of Guernsey during the 2nd World War.
B008200LHW|5.0|So I ordered this to replace my Delorme Earthmates I have used for chasing storms for years now.  I needed a GPS puck like this that would work in Windows 7 64 bit because my old GPS by Delorme did not have drivers or software for their serial emulator beyond Windows XP 32 bit so that was the last piece hold me back from modernizing my OS.<br /><br />I ordered from Beach Audio and was at my house the next evening.  I like this unit because of the Windows 7 32/64 bit support, built in magnet, and SiRF Star IV GPS chipset which allows for use in urban canyons, and in dense foliage.  I bought it for being underneath supercell thunderstorms.<br /><br />So I tested it out and the sat signal acquisition time was fast, and it saw many (around 12) satellites from inside my house sitting on the couch.  I could never do this with my Delorme Earthmates so I can already vouch for the radio being excellent.  I also use Fransom GPSGate as the port emulator which has worked great so far.<br /><br />A word of advice is that do not confuse this unit with the BU-353-W or the original BU-353 as the S4 is the newest and best.  Although the original or \\"W\\" model for weatherproof would do just fine for most people I would pay the small difference and get the S4 with the new SiRF Star IV GPS chipset.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good book- however, my kindle fire, the second one I purchased, also has defects, this one has lines, which are getting worse and difficult to read, so I can't purchase any more books. I will not buy a third kindle fire as there is no guarantee that it will not be defective.
B003O86FMW|5.0|WOW, is all I can say! This book never stops with danger, love, trust, and hate around every corner. This is a book that makes it hard to put down until you finish the last chapter.
0385535147|3.0|OK - so here is my main problem with this book -- John Grisham cheats to get to his surprise finish at the end.  What I mean by this is -- the character telling the story gives the reader misleading information to set up a \\"surprise finish\\" at the end.  And that is annoying.  I get that the character has to mislead other characters intentionally, and I thought that the fun of the book was supposed to be seeing how that all played out.<br /><br />Spoiler alert!<br /><br />For example, the main character first talks about his love interest Vanessa as if she were a virtual stranger he encountered by chance in the visiting area, that they had lost touch, and that it was questionable as to how she would respond to him getting in touch with her.  At the end, we find out that she is the sister of his best friend and has pretty much been part of the plot that he had been hatching all along.  I could have even lived with it better if Grisham had just let us do more wondering about the nature of their relationship instead of intentially misleading us.<br /><br />We could say the same thing about his relationships with most of the other characters in the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was very good I lover the detail I have a question can you come to my school and talk about how does it fell being an Arthur our school is Westside school district in laurel hollow 1597 laurel hollow road superset ny 11791
B00AAX68HG|5.0|it is awesome!! I LOVE this game!!! it is very cool and I wish I had this game it's awsome.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this is one of my all time favourite app. it is really easy to set up and you literally have all the power of a computer.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I loved the &#34;voice&#34; in this book.  Although you know the end of the story after the first paragraph, the reading journey was delightful.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Great app, using it on my Kindle, Galaxy S3, also on my wife's Kindle.  Sites come through with pictures and the layout is very easy to read.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is an awesome album.  The melodies and lyrics are equally excellent.  Anyone who likes folk music should purchase the album.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I have now seen the movie and read all three books. I would have to say, overall, I liked them as I was drawn into the story, partly by the movie, and wanted to see how it ended. I won't give anything away here, but the ending is what you would expect. Critically speaking, the writing left me feeling something was missing. I guess I wanted more action, more thrill, than the page after page of a 17 year-old's constant introspection, constant questioning who loves me and who do I love. Maybe that's the point of the story. The events surrounding Katniss's &#34;finding&#34; herself is of secondary importance. I don't want to go on and on here but suffice it to say the story is intriguing in a post apocalyptic way and one can only hope that the society Katniss is becoming an adult in can truly change for the good. Thank goodness they no longer have to give up their children to the games.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this free with my camera purchase. Great for traveling. Lots of pocket & very light weight. Love it!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|First, the bad, Not a lot of substance to this movie, but that may be in line with the old series. I've never seen it so can't be sure. It does have a good plot, excellent acting and direction and the SFX are excellent (possibly the best I've seen). Perhaps a second watch will make it better now that I have an idea of what's going on, but that may be a while, I have other new stuff to watch first.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I Could not stop reading, on to the next and last :) I am officially a fan! Go hunger games!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Love the Beatles!!!  Child of the sixties and had to have this set...Great quality and production values...have recommended to others...
B0054OGQS2|2.0|Let's start off by saying the picture and sound quality of this blu ray movie is pretty fantastic, not reference quality but it looks and sounds great.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, the movie is basically a fantasy vendetta film against the Nazis that requires some serious suspension of disbelief in the execution of a grand plan to assassinate Hitler and other Nazi VIPs. Regardless, I'm still looking for Tarantino to put something out that was as satisfying as Kill Bill: Vol 2 on the visual and story level. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like this film, I wasn't able to.
B0094KF4WG|2.0|I really didn't enjoy this. Admittedly it's not a genre I usually look twice at but hey it had to be something special right? It was the amazing story of justice after those horrible 9/11 attacks, not to mention the decade of war that followed. And yet it was SUCH A DRAG!!! Honestly, I didn't finish it, I got a third of the way through and just went 'nope, can't do this'. I think I was expecting things to happen. The war stories are interesting and I like the idea but it is written in a way that makes it pretty boring and pretty hard to be interested. It seems as if they're just glazing over events without any real substance or character development. It's just not very exciting and I understand that this isn't an action/thriller, it's a story about the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden and also previous missions but it is still the writers job to keep the reader interested. Evidently lots of people disagree with me but for me it was one of the worst books I've read in recent memory.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Easy to draw.  Enjoy playing the game with friends. Light touch.  Quick and mindless fun, although some of the clues can be hard to figure out how to draw them
B002RI9UBS|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was fun and thoughtful although to be honest the first 100 pages were the best. Admittedly when the cast gets cut down to just two, things are bound to get a bit slower and a few sequences where they were on the boat seemed like they were just thrown in there to draw it out a bit but that's just a mild complaint. Would definitely recommend reading it.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Was great to catch up on some episodes that I missed during the season. I enjoyed watching the show on my time without rescheduling activities or meetings around the episodes
096798467X|5.0|It is an excellent book - it describes what you would need to know about building your own oven along with a prototyping approach to help assure your success.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has a great storyline...awesome graphics. There are plenty of mini games to keep game play interesting!!! I highly recommend this game!
B00884GR0W|5.0|Although I was skeptical at first, this has proven to be the best game of its kind. It is much better than Minecraft, and cheaper, as well.<br />  The game play is great, the graphics are visually stunning, the effects are superb, and the random generator is awesome. So fun to explore and create.<br />  Amazing job, Mind Blocks.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very good and isn't bad at all it works for me &amp; hopefully for you. I recommend this app for people who are trying to find a calculator app!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love to have a good read while on break from work. I was not disappointed this holiday season. Nice read.
1449415881|5.0|This calendar has become an annual gift to my son.  Scott Adams must have been in my office to record some of these.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Product was as described and shipped quickly. I was very pleased. My husband and I spent Christmas Day listening to all of the cd's. thanks!
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Just like many goofy/crude comedies, the first 1/2 to 2/3 of this movie is chock full of laughs while it peters out a little (no family guy pun intended) toward the end when the movie is forced to wrap up the various plot lines. A good rental movie on a Saturday night spent in.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Funny story line, filmed in a beautiful location, the director could have edited out all the swearing words, I recommended it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books were very exciting and entertaining.<br />I could not stop reading until I had finished all three books. Great.
B004U52VPS|5.0|These provide hours of fun for little kids!<br /><br />Made from very durable materials, it will last a long time, excellent value for money.
076115728X|5.0|Great buy, thanks again!<br /><br />All books arrived in excellent condition.<br /><br />The kids at our school enjoy reading the new books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book deals with real emotion and you feel the characters feeling with them.  The  things that Skye and Holder go though are so real.  Colleen Hoover did not disappoint with this one ! If you enjoyed Slammed and  Point of Retreat you will love Hopeless.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I found this movie to be entertaining and good looking.  I liked the story and would recommend this movie to anyone.  The comical characters were a good addition to the movie.
B000SEI230|5.0|Its is unbelievable knowing how many times i cried over this book. Its BEAUTIFUL. I literally spent 2 hours after crying my eyes out, i hate hate hate reading. Then i read this book which was just about 2 and a half weeks ago, and have been so interested in Nicholas Sparks books! I definitely recommend you to read this book. Definitely inspired me.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|All i have to say is.. meh.  It's ok.  the funny is average or less.  I liked the personality given to the bear.
B004LROUW2|3.0|It's tough to review such an inconsistent book. At times, 1Q84 feels astonishingly original and captivating; but more often, it's trite and self-indulgent. For every thrilling scene, there are about three boring ones. Murakami has written great stuff in the past, and he's written terrible stuff, and here he manages to do both at the same time. What a frustrating work of art.<br /><br />Plot-wise, this three-volume saga concerns the parallel adventures of Tengo (a math teacher and aspiring novelist) and Aomame (a fitness instructor and part-time assassin of abusive men). Both characters get caught in an adventure involving a powerful religious cult, magical beings called the Little People, and a parallel universe where there are two moons in the sky. (The parallel universe is the \\"1Q84\\" of the title, and it exists in opposition to the \\"real\\" year 1984.)<br /><br />If you think this plot description sounds exciting, please put the brakes on your expectations. 1Q84 is not an exciting story, nor are its fantasy elements particularly well-developed. The two moons...are just two moons. The Little People pop up once in a while, and do nothing much. And much of the \\"action\\" consists of Tengo and Aomame sitting around in their apartments, wondering how they got sucked into a parallel universe and what they should do next.<br /><br />But, to be fair, I sometimes appreciated Murakami's slow pacing and introspective approach to the material. Even though 1Q84 has some fantasy elements, I think Murakami is clearly more interested in exploring his realistic themes (alienation, loneliness and longing, urban living, death, etc). At times, his approach to these themes is very honest and powerful. But toward the end, he falls down on the job by introducing a rather trite and unsatisfying romance, which undermines his more interesting exploration of darker themes. His prose, meanwhile, flows smoothly and works well for some scenes, but on the whole it's too plain and unambitious.<br /><br />In short, this is a book that opens up many interesting doors, then fails to go through any of them. I found it memorable and mostly enjoyable to read, but aggravating in the end (the final pages are very disappointing, and knocked a whole star off my rating). To address some of the positive reviews, I certainly don't think this is a masterpiece, and I don't think it says anything especially insightful or profound about Japanese culture. Indeed, to me this is just a clever pop novel. (It shares several themes with \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" but is actually less feminist and less progressive than Stieg Larsson's work.) It's really too bad, but I think Murakami peaked a long time ago, and the best he can manage here is a partial return to his old form.
B001RNO7CG|4.0|This is a high-quality shoe. Great build quality, Great fit, The shoe was perfect except for one little hitch. The top of the shoe rubs slightly at the top of my left ankle. I still wear them all the time and love the shoes. There is slight discomfort with extended wear due to the ankle thing. I'm willing to admit it may just be a weird shaped ankle on my part. In any case this is a well-made shoe, very durable, sturdy, looks good. You would do well to have a pair in your  closet
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game because it makes you think.<br />It is very addicting.<br />And it is also a great way to keep the kids quiet for a bit...lol.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I'm not sure if it was just operator error but I could not get this app to work for me. I still cant print from my kindle.
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|Definitely a quality mount - which is what I've come to expect from RAM products. Durable enough to withstand the abuse of use on my ATV.
B005E7AOHI|5.0|Been to at least 10 shows and am long time fan! Love love love this album!!! Definitely worth the wait!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Absolutely loved this song the second I heard it for the first time.  Just HAD to have a copy of this.  Something about the catchy melody/words just makes me happy.  Can't explain it.  JUST LOVE it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My 3 yr old loves it!  She needs help with the reading parts but loves the game and getting new pets!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It is a wonderful story that need to be told again and again.  It is great for anti-bullying effort.  Would have liked to see more drawings.
085738371X|5.0|Each book is over 600 pages but I found I could read them in big chunks so it took about a week to read them all.  Then sold them on ebay and made most of the money back that I spent on them.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites.  I love the music throughout the movie. Tom Hanks is awesome as Forrest.
B008I34ZFW|3.0|I had no doubt I was going to get this film after seeing their earlier one that spoofed Trek and Babylon 5. But even though I liked Iron Sky very much I found many things that left me feeling let down by the final product. First off the trailers gave the impression of a much more dramatic story than what one gets. That it was meant to be a comedy if fine, just bill it as a comedy. One should never fib to your audience, especially if they're your standard sci-fi fan that loves to nit pick on the details.<br /><br /> Some of those nits were the discordance of thinking a very pragmatic and industrious people such as the Nazi were would spend their entire time sealed in a (literal) vacuum while they made their plans to return and conquer. It would seem more realistic that they would have maintained an intelligence link through surviving party members that escaped to neutral countries like Argentina. It would also give them a place to set a base of operations to better support their logistics. Along the same lines one has to ask where the heck did they get the materials to build their base, make their clothing, etc. It sure wouldn't be from moon dust or (very) thin air! But a comedy isn't suppose to delve too deeply normally. However since the movie had a satirical bend to it that DOES require greater depth to pull that off effectively. One scene did work. The one where the German guards were looking and commenting on the Playboy magazine and it's &#34;hairless&#34; women. That was pulled off quite well. It might even qualify as the best scene overall.<br /><br />The CGI again was very well done and again I'm of the opinion that it sets a standard that the larger lazy cookie cutter film makers would do well to pay heed to rather than continue their boring &#34;Ok we pushed that start button, tweaked the same tiresome graphics and plot progressions we've used a dozen times before so the audience won't be able to tell....the film is done!&#34; If I had any complaint with things it was there wasn't enough CGI. One of the things I really enjoyed about the prior movie, and what made it stand out, was the amount of realistic CGI employed in the battles. It really got my attention and I was looking forward to the repeat this time. Instead I was left wanting. There just wasn't enough this time to get a full appreciation of the quality and the effort that requires.<br /><br />You also have to admire the ability to take a German city and turn it into a replica of New York for the city scenes. Far more impressive than NYC itself.<br /><br />If you want to think I'm being too much a nit picker, I'll agree with you. That's because when I like something I look into the nooks and crannies and see what could have been done to make it better. For what the movie set out to do, an amusing spoof little of the Nazis, Sarah Palin, and the rest of the crass shallow leaders and their lackeys (who should be put before a firing squad rather than on a ballot!), it succeeded. However it did NOT live up to it's potential which could easily have placed it on a legendary status had it been realized. THAT is the part that disappoints the most.<br /><br />It's worth seeing, just don't get your hopes up too high.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|it was not exactly what i was expecting, but it was a great movie.  i would definately watch it again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Kids and I love this one too just a fun game of solitaire that the whole family can play together.
B000HKW7E0|1.0|Either bad packaging or rough handling, but this arrived cracked, so it was a return.<br /><br />This is the BEST Christmas movie though.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is another fun and addicting card game that I would recommend to anyone kids like it as well ADDICTING
B0067EKY9K|1.0|This DVD does not play in my blu ray machine. It comes up with a message that it is the wrong zone
B00A80SHFM|5.0|THnak you soooooo Much was in great condition...cant stop singing!!! this<br />has got to be one of the best cds I have ever Bought
B005S9EK1S|4.0|I bought this because I hade read the book. It was enjoyable and Zac Ephron was very good in the lead roll.
B008602KQI|5.0|I may be a tad biased because I read the books before viewing the film, but nonetheless the film did not disappoint.  Jennifer Lawrence is a rising star.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This is a fabulous movie full of laughs and tears. It's a movie for young and old alike. It played well.
B003L77GGK|5.0|If you are a fan of this series, you should add this to yours. It pulls you in to the series like a night soap opera. Just can't wait to see what happens next.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE.  EXCELLENT DELIVERY TIME.  LIVED UP TO ALL THE HYPE BOTH ABOUT THE MOVIE AND AMAZON SERVICE.  I ORDERED IT THE BUSIEST TIME OF THE YEAR AND THE FOLLOW THRU WAS PERFECT.
B000001DU5|5.0|I grew up on this kind of music and it bought back lots of memmories. Great music from the past and would make a great addition to anyones collection.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|like a fine wine, she gets better with age! loved it! I have all her books. can' wait for the next one.
B005HS00NW|4.0|This album is highly entertaining. The overall tone of the album changes to a slower beat on disc two as compared to the first disc.
B006O6F932|3.0|The same with any of the bought dollhouses made from plastice, little flimsy, but  folds up so nicely.  Glad I ordered on line as it was much cheaper.  My girls were so happy to get this for Christmas from Santa.  Big surprise.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|After a slow start in developing the plot, the movie ended strong with the too guys winning.  I would recomend Lawless.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I have tried everything possible and I cannot log on to the game. No happy with this app. What to do?
B0090P0O70|5.0|An outstanding classic, worth the time! A story not so much of horror but rather humanity. Still I wonder, who is the villan, Victor Frankenstein, his creation, or rather humanity? You decide! Equally I wonder who is the hero or righteous one. Enjoy, and ponder if you will.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie and the cast worked very well with each other. Having watched the soap opera Dark Shadows in the 70's it was fun to see.
B004X8W4A4|4.0|this is the first &#34;heat&#34; I have read and enjoyed it.  will read the rest and that is that for now
1439190275|5.0|It's all here, is much as you can put in a book about 'low carb' dieting and living. I thought I had read Atkins years ago.  This version is so much more.  Extremely helpful.
1451695195|4.0|It was an interesting read and caused one to think why we are here.  However,starting a new page for each chapter wasted paper and slowed down the reading.
B000002GZ1|5.0|It is amazing to hear Paul Butterfield Blues Band's album giving out a dish of raw blues falvoured with a fiery dash of harp and tight,colourful sounds.<br /><br />I have kept hearing repeatedly the album and it still gives me the groove.I'll rate this album with 5 stars to justify the nasty blues of PBBB.<br /><br />Worth waiting for PBBB's mystery train anytime.<br /><br />Cheers
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent. Make sure you have lots of time to sit and read! Couldn't wait to start the next one in the trilogy.
1596912863|5.0|I loved the idea behind this book. I mean hello who hasn't watched BBC P&P and felt as the character in this book did? Jane is the down to earth heroin who is obsessed with Jane Austin. P&P being her favorite.<br /><br />Even when alone with a man she cannot get Darcy out of her mind. She then decides to use her life savings to go to Austenland. Unfortunately for Jane she cannot get the Deluxe package and her experience has limitations. Her clothes and room is not as grand as other guests.<br /><br />This book was so much fun for any girl who can picture stepping back through time to live as woman did in Austins book. Every guest is said to experience a personal romance. This was also made into a movie and OMG was it good. I loved the actors and actresses that were selected.<br /><br />I originally didn't rate this book so highly but after I reread the book I really became involved and enjoyed myself. Funny how time can do that for you.
B0094M4Q3M|5.0|Not too much to say for those who were born in the 70s, for the new generation this movie will entertain as well.
B001K3K5MO|1.0|This is a great movie, lots of action and great acting. And then there's Kenny Loggins music. Sound isn't great, and no CC.  When you are half deaf CC makes the viewing experience much more enjoyable. This stream isn't HD, but not too bad. Encoding is poor.  Buy the DVD for $7.50, don't pay for this stream.
B0090EJ99A|3.0|I will say this one is just ok, it will probably make you want to laugh a couple of times, but if you are in the mood for watching an ok comedy you will actually laugh (a couple of times :)
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This finishes the trilogy for Pendergast (or does it??). You have to read this episode of the best damn detective/FBI agent ever put to word. And the ending leaves just a crack in the door if P&C decide to bring the characters back.
1594487154|5.0|This book is a refreshing take on how to motivate people. Pink introduces the new &#34;ABCs&#34; of selling (&#34;Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity&#34;) and a remarkably practical method to apply them. Instead of anecdotes, he refers to cutting edge behavioral research to back his concepts. It's tactical without being cheesy.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|A pop culture must see.  The 10th Ann. Edition offers extra background and insight. A movie I will also pull off the shelf from time to time. The Dude abides.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I like it if you want to play for a short time.  The only thing is that you have to buy more bubbles if you want to play longer.
B00004U8P9|5.0|This is an awesome cult classic that needs to be rewatched from time to time. The songs and music have held up over the years. I hear a new tribute to old cinema each time I watch it, which sends me to the computer to Google a name.  The 25th Ann. Edition provides extra background and insight.

B00AL8F5EM|5.0|This book is a great resource for parents who want practical ideas and advice for raising bilingual children. It combines both research from experts and experience from multilingual families, which makes a great combination of the latest science with what works in real-life family situations. The author herself has two bilingual daughters, and so she approaches the topic as both a parent and a researcher. The result is a book that is easy to read and chock full of useful information and resources. It is a book that would be useful at any stage of parenting- whether you have a baby, toddler, school-age child or teenager, you will find advice on how to make bilingualism work in your family. I am the mother of a bilingual 3-year-old, and I think I will be re-reading this book over the years as my daughter grows and new challenges arise. This book is definitely worth adding to your library!
B000641D2Y|5.0|I love the price and the product ...it was exactly what I needed and way cheaper than buying it at the store

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't believe Colleen could top herself but she did. I was drawn into the story right away after reading the sample.

B009ERK1T0|2.0|I am a hardcore deftones fan.. And I figured it would be hard to top diamond eyes, but this cd seems like they took all the leftover studio tracks that didnt make diamond eyes and put it on one album, sound quality is to be admired as well just didnt move me, its like another minerva to me

B008ZOHCKE|1.0|I thought this would be a great app for keeping all my handwritten school notes in one place. However, you have to use your on-screen keyboard - not write your notes on the lined paper within the app. How I wish I could get a refund as I uninstalled it immediately.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|Pretty good puzzles for young ones. My 2 1/2 year old gets bored with them after about 30-45 min.  At least until the next day.<br />I think I had to pay 1.99 for the extra 12 puzzles (you get 4 free).  But it was worth it for those times when I needed my daughter to focus on something.
B00999DFP0|5.0|In the cult tradition of Spartacus, the halls of every science department now echoes: \\"I AM SHELDON\\"!<br /><br />Currently into its sixth season, The Big Bang Theory proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. Even if the show seems to have slowed down form its initial explosive impetus, I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of Frasier and Seinfeld - and Big Bang Theory is consistently brilliant!<br /><br />Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.<br /><br />His equally super-intelligent (yet sexually confused at times girlfriend), Amy Farrah Fowler, received a far more enlarged role since the fifth season. However, she was not a very good addition and she unbalances the show. Her character only manages to blur the focus form Sheldon (there is only room for one idiosyncratic genius!), diffuse a number of comically charged situations and gum up the show's flow.<br /><br />Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself (who Sheldon tries to \\"help\\" by steering him towards a teaching career), he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.<br /><br />Leonard tried his hand in a long-distance relationship with his friend Raj's sister, Priya, but he seems to be gravitating back towards Penny once more.<br /><br />Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD (and Sheldon will never let him forget it). An engineer (whose crowning achievements were a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle and a liquid waste management solution), he also managed to wreck the Mars Rover in hopes of landing a girl (but he made sure no one can prove anything).<br /><br />The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.<br /><br />Howard used to be the show-stealer. Whenever he entered the scene you just knew he would offer such an outrageous perceptive that would render you speechless. Now, if only Howard's character was allowed to continue in its stellar trajectory. He has been weighted down by his fianc&eacute;e, Bernadette, who is very likeable, but also is cramping his style. Not to mention that she, slowly yet inescapably, is turning into his scary mother.<br /><br />Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He takes the \\"metrosexual\\" lifestyle a little too literal for his own good and he keeps using the \\"poor Indian\\" defense even if his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley. His character, even in the current sixth season, remains underdeveloped.<br /><br />Then there is Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.<br /><br />The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch, the fish-out-of-the-water) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!<br /><br />The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!oy this is to own it on DVD.

B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is extremely addictive, although the solo version can get a little predictable. The times I played online, some of  the games took too long, but it is nice that you can be involved in multiple games at one time, so that you won't get bored.  You just need to remember your strategy for each game....
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Great movie. One of my favorites.  This one can be watched over and over.  Love this movie and all the actors!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game was very intuitive, while also providing increasingly hard levels and mission requirements.  The controls are extremely easy, and many of the special powers are pretty cool.
0425263916|5.0|Bared to you was great and then Sylvia comes out with Reflected and it is even better!!! What can I say...GET THIS BOOK! Way better than 50 Shades!!!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game is awesome.  You don't even have to really like golf (although that certainly helps!) Some of the holes are tough to get into, while others seem very easy.  I think I got it for free, but definitely worth paying for.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have had this game for almost 2 months now, and still play it often.  I don't have Temple Run, but I think it is probably a lot like it, from what I have read/seen from the pics.<br />Very easy controls and very intuitive.

B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Love Wahlberg- was surprised he'd do such a poor movie.  Just watch the previews  - they are the only funny parts.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|For $5 I expect the quality of Amazon HD to be better than what I could torrent.  It was awful.  Get a Netflix subscription and rent a Blu-ray if you want a the best HD experience.

B008E374PO|5.0|I have no idea what Adam Young (the person) is like, but Adam Young (the musician) is outstanding.  As a musician myself, I know how tedious and challenging it is to create well produced music.  The mix, the grove, the mood it projects, the affect it has on the listener.  Adam is aces all around.  His creations soar with wonderful catchy melodies that just make you want to get up and dance.  It's rare I run across a musician that draws me in to listen to as many as 20 gorgeous tracks repetatively.  Whenever I want to feel uplifted I turn the 20 on with plently of digital ambience...like I'm in a huge arena....fantastic!
0525952926|5.0|This book picked up very smoothely from where he left off in The Fall of Giants.<br />Very interesting continuation of the characters and their lives, and how they play forward.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Yes, yes we all know it is now a movie... But Mr.Quick hits it out of the park with this novel.  Mental illness is a huge white elephant in the world, and this novel draws attention to the lack of acceptance of people with mental illness.<br />Easy read, even for the men in your life... Lots of football and &#34;guy&#34; relationships in this novel as the main character is a guy.  You love and hate other characters in this book through out.. and as the story line grows you get to see into the life of a young man being affected by a tragic life event, and his road to over come and recover from it. Get some tissues ready for the end!<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />I would have liked to know more of the actual story between the accident, and Pat being in the &#34;bed place&#34; and perhaps a diagnosis of his mental illness, but that is the healthcare professional in me!
B009VL28W2|5.0|best Metallica live blu-ray .. great set list ... sound is amazing and it's well shot.. Not to mention the price is right
B006LSZECO|3.0|My book club and I had been watching this book's very firm hold on the top books for several months.  Seeing that it was continuing to get such high ratings and was maintaining on the best seller list, we gave it a go.<br /><br />Our bookclub met yesterday so it's still very fresh in my mind.  I enjoyed the start of the book and found the author's writing style to be pleasant and inviting.  I was hooked.  And then, without spoiling the book for those who perhaps haven't read it yet, it just got too much.  And I wanted to book to end. Such a shame.  I was intrigued and interested and, frankly, captivated by Amy's brilliance (\\"crazy like a fox\\")...but it then just seemed to take too many curves and loops and towards the end I found I stopped caring about the characters.  The ending was so very disappointing too.<br /><br />The thing is, we had such a wonderful discussion about the book.  50% didn't care for it and didn't understand the hype and 50% thought the ending was intriguing.  I think the strength of this novel is the writer's genius ability to write two different books mirrored by two different characters--not a simple feat.<br />It kept us reading and talking...I just wish Amy had a different fate.  In any case, this was not my favorite read recently and I don't understand all the hype...other than people liking the \\"who dunnit\\" kind of books that take elements from our every day events (i.e. Scott Peterson, Drew Peterson, and the like).<br /><br />I think this is the case of an overhyped novel.  Truly (other than the author's ability to write two novels in one) nothing special.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great edition, have a nice book with wonderful pictures and hace 5 blu-rays!<br />The 3 Batman films in ony one book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would have never think of me reading a book like this, but I couldn't put to first one down and now I can't believe I'm already finished. Buying the third as we speak :) would defiantly recommend!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|loved the app. is a great way to waste time. some of the games are deffinately a little hard to play with the controls and all but overall it was great
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Okay I'm giving this book three stars because I loved the main character and all the feelings I felt in it. Personally I thought the writing was a little choppy. I felt that the reason why the writing wasn't like a high schooler' s writing because he was learning about the world. But I also thought there might be a better way of writing it too such as maybe more descriptive and maybe describe your feelings a little better. Other than that I loved the new meaning to the word wallflower and the story of this boy. I will admit the ending kind of changed my whole view of the book so I hadn't to read it again. A book that is truly a different experience.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Maybe I am just an idiot, but I did not find this game easy to figure out.  I spent quite some time with the demo and found the instructions lacking.  I am an Xbox player and always found their demos excellent, this one did not provide enough info.  I am glad I got the demo and did not pay for it.

B002QW7AJY|5.0|My husband and I rented this movie on a whim and hadn't heard anything about it.  we really enjoyed it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought it was the best book in the series and the best I have ever read in my life
B0053O89U6|3.0|this season of modern family is not my favorite.  it seemed like i could hardly make it through many episodes.  the disc played well.  hoping the next season is better.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|I am of the age that I saw this movie when it first premiered, and I have always loved its family-first themes and delightful music. It was a special pleasure to enjoy watching the HD version with my 7 year old son, who thoroughly enjoyed the movie. He is still humming the tunes and wondering when we will have time to fly our kite together!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great Big Book...Easy to read and carry.  Inspirational and calming.  Thanks for the free copy for my new Kindle Fire.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The three books are a wonderful story of two characters who are both new to love. Book two picks up right after book one and takes you on a wonderful ride into the future.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is one of the first apps we place on my whole families devices.  This is a #1 game at my house.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as well book two and three. They are a wonderfully smart, sexy, funny, romantic and sad love story. The characters of Christian and Ana are so well written you can't help feeling all the emotions they feel as they struggle with a relationship that is new to both of them.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|My 12 year old loves this game.  It is the first one she wants to play after school and the last one before bed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a great story of love, promise, fear, hope and trust that  leaves you wanting &#34;more&#34;. The characters make you laugh and cry from page one on to the end.
B005HSL626|5.0|You just can't stop playing this game!  You will play it over and over to see what comes up next.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|We purchased this product for our daughter shortly after we moved to another state to help her feel excited about being in a new house and new room.  The decals are a nice size, they peel off and on without taking the paint off (except for the gems, once they are taken off they cannot be put back on--we learned this after her little brother decided to redecorate the decals!)  I think for the number of decals you get, it is a great deal!  I highly recommend this product for the little princess in your life!
B00407PNY2|5.0|I've seen this many times. Good movie. Well acted. And the best car chase ever put on film (sorry, Seven Ups).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There are not enough words to describe the masterpiece that is Downton Abbey<br />I have started back over watching every episode from the beginning just because I love it so much.<br />The music<br />The scenery<br />The language<br />The furniture<br />The Abbey<br />The characters<br />I could do go forever!!!<br />LOVE THIS!!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|We went and saw this movie when it came out. Laughed the whole time. So I rented for our movie night. Laughed the whole time again. It's a great movie.
B0015DROBO|5.0|It was a very gripping novel.  I was so impressed with it, I bought Book 2 and Book 3.  I can't wait to read the other two books.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|My kids and I are big fans of the original Bourne series. So naturally we were excited about this latest installment. Nope. Very boring. I understand you have to set up the back drop but boring. I will not buy this to put in our collection. Hopefully, the next one will be better.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I originally bought this because my son loves Shrek and I had seen all the movies way too many times (sorry big green guy).  I was hoping that maybe it was the accent that he liked and this would add some variety to our viewing.  Turns out it was the accent that he liked and the the three \\"princes\\" entertain him greatly.  It also turns out that I learned this is one of the most beautiful stories ever put in a movie (let alone animated).  There is something for everyone.  What I truly love is the optimistic outlook the movie ends on and the beautiful scenery throughout.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|love this app - very informative and always at my finger tips.  wish we had put it on the 2nd Kindle as well
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is a great game, far more than I expected.<br />I have played this through all the way in both Samurai and Zombie modes.<br />I loved \\"Plants Vs. Zombies.\\"<br />This is another defense game (or offense on the zombie side), but it holds up very well on its own.<br />The various characters are well designed, the game looks great, and the higher the level, the more challenging it gets.<br />Highest recommendation.
B008220AVW|5.0|The movie was realistic and emotional.  I saw how it really was for a singer and entertainer to go on tour, and everything that going on tour entails.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I bought this movie for a great-grandson as a Christmas gift.  The entire family watched it on Christmas afternoon.  It was delightful - not many movies out there that will engage both young and old interests - but this was one of them!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. Normally I don't go for romance books, but when I found this one and from the summary given I gave it a chance. I loved this book from the back and forth between Megan and Connor to just the writing style of the author that just flowed made this a good read.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is a &#34;back in time&#34; compelling read from an author who is better known for a different kind of novel. It held my interest from page one.  I liked the intersection with an important historical event as well as the conjecture of what might happen if &#34;history&#34; were changed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was a gripping story - couldn't put it down!  I wish there was more to read about these characters.  So lovable!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Interesting.wish life could be so unexpected but ..can take your mind off of real life,for a few hours. Love happy endings
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I don't know how this is on everyone's best of the year list but it is.  I was going to give it 3 stars but changed to 4 because maybe I was so uncomfortable with the material that I am not seeing it clearly.  This book will probably be a great discussion book.  Well written and the dilemma is terrifying and I do feel Landay handled that very honestly.  I don't know.  Maybe reading it over the holidays in addition to it being a real downer is clouding my judgement.  But hey, 4 stars is good right?
B00915G6MG|5.0|\\"NCIS\\" returned for its tenth season in 2012-2013, and showed no signs of resting on its laurels as the top-rated network television drama.  It continues to offer exciting crime-of-the-week plots, to be solved by a well-chosen cast whose interactions are as entertaining as the forensics.  Mark Harmon returns as crusty Senior Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, head of a high profile investigation team and father figure of an improvised family.<br /><br />\\"NCIS\\" begins its tenth season dealing with the aftermath of an horrific terrorist attack on the NCIS headquarters.  The attack injures several team members and leaves pathologist \\"Ducky\\" Mallard (David McCallum) clinging to life after a heart attack.  The early episodes are devoted to a ruthless hunt for the man responsible for the attack, and to dealing with the trauma of the attack, which affects the entire organization.  A thoughtful two part episode later in the first half of the season deals specifically with post-traumatic stress disorder as a key factor in a murder.  The investigation will cause the team, especially Gibbs, to confront its effects.  Another story arc beginning after the holiday break will place the careers and lives of several characters at risk; some will not survive.  A spring episode may reveal the origins of forensic technician Abby Sciuto's (Pauley Parrette) relationship with Gibbs.<br /><br />\\"NCIS\\" is pretty good about taking care of its recurring characters, and this season is no exception.  Special Agent Tony DiNozzo's father (Robert Wagner) makes a poigant return visit in the Christmas episode, to stay with Tony in his heretofore unseen bachelor apartment.  Coast Guard Investigator Abigail Borin (Diane Neal) helps break a perplexing case involving a helicopter crash; Tony (Michael Weatherly) and McGee (Sean Murray) make a fateful bet on who will get a date with the fiesty redhead.  FBI Agent Fornell (Joe Spano) will reluctantly assist Gibbs in a case involving their mutual ex-wife.  And Tony and Ziva will have renewed cause to explore the depths of their partnership, in a case involving Ziva's father.<br /><br />The tenth season of \\"NCIS\\" is very highly recommended to its fans.  This reviewer hopes the series isn't getting ready to write its own finale.nd Tony and Ziva will have renewed cause to explore the depths of their partnership, in a case involving Ziva's father.<br /><br />The tenth season of \\"NCIS\\" is very highly recommended to its fans.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I want to preface this review with stating that I read this book after reading &#34;Defending Jacob&#34;.  DJ was a downer of a book (albeit well written etc.) and &#34;The Night Circus&#34; just swept me away to another place and time. I love a book that takes me away.  Please don't think that because you loved &#34;Water for Elephants&#34; that you will automatically love &#34;Night Circus&#34;.  This is a very different book.  It is more about illusions and the possibility of much more than just slight of hand tricks. It's also a love story at it's core and to what lengths people will go to be together. I want to go to this circus!  You will too after reading this book.
0131988425|5.0|bought this edition to refresh my 1975 edition.<br />extra items covered and more modern information presented<br />everyone should have a copy in their library.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Surprised it lasted this long, but I am glad I found it on netflix.  Was missing a few episodes to catch up to the new season.  It was well worth it to purchase the few episodes and now I can just watch it on Hulu 1 day after each episode is aired

B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so much fun. I could play it forever.<br />for the people who think this game is stupid just cause they don't know what it is, they don't know what they are missing.<br />there are two modes. creative and survival.<br />creative mode has all the blocks unlocked and you have a jetpack so you can fly and reach higher. you can build a house in the sky. plus you can stay underwater infinitely. so you can build an underwater house. it never becomes night on creative mode so there are no zombies. something cool about creative mode that I recently discovered is that you can make &quot;jumps&quot; to the void. then you die and respawn. but it is really cool. if you dig deep enough you'll find the end. I would reccommend doing creative node first. you learn the controls, how to build shelters, and where to find gems like diamond. it is quite easy after you play creative mode.<br />then there is survival mode. it has night. you start off with noting at all. then you must dig with your hands to collect blocks.you can mine trees too. if younger wood you can make a wooden pickaxes. then you mine some stone and you can make a stone pickaxes. if you find iron ore you can make an iron pickaxes and so on. you can kill animals to get food which restores hearts. you eat it by holdingit down. then it makes munching sounds as you eat it. you can of course mine for gold, diamond,  coal, iron ore, lapis lazuli, and redstone (idk how to collect it) . of course you can also craft stuff with a crafting table. and at night there are deadly creatures out to get you. zombies try to eat your brains. creepers blow up. spiders jump attack you. skeleton archers shoot arrows at you. they are kind of scary. if you kill them at night you get stuff like rope and gunpowder and feathers and bones and arrows. so I would say don't go out at night. day is cool though. you can explore. but you have to wait a little bit because creepers and zombies and the archers can walk a bit in daylight before smoking and dying. they respawn at night. oh and if you die it is not game over. you can respawn but you loose everything in your inventory.<br /><br />all In all a great game. get the paid version. on the free for the Ipod you cant save. it is TOTALLY WORTH IT. :)
0553801473|5.0|R.R. Martin's charcter's are very well defined. In his later books, such as this one, they have a life of their own.

006117758X|3.0|Bukowski writes with a grittiness I love. His stories are always very interesting but, like many of his stories lack any real closure.
B00A196SE2|4.0|I have pre-ordered this, because I want it as soon as it comes out, but I am still wondering if I should hold off. I know with a lot of shows, they will release a \\"special limited edition\\" of the show with the behind the scenes, bonus features, etc. and I desperately want those as well!  If anyone knows when they might announce a special pack like this or knows who I can contact, that would be great!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This is definitely a Young Adult Love Story.  The author writes well and I enjoyed it, but I think the reviews were actually better than the story demands.  I think we just like &#34;new love&#34;, which this story dishes up page after page . . . (it gets tiring and you just want to get on with the story already).  There are some unpleasant subject matters in the book, which taint the romance for me.  The male protagonist talks and thinks more like a mature adult than someone under 18 who is crazy about a girl, which is probably why I was able to finish the book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great for all ages.  It is a very addective game.  It is even available now for windows 8 of which I have purchased

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Season 2 of FX Network's &#34;American Horror Story: Asylum&#34; is an outstanding offering of sophisticated horror on numerous levels. Visually stunning, and intellectually stimulating as well, AHS combines a complex reservoir of source material from which the writers tap to weave a story that is frightening, compelling, erotic, dangerous, insightful, dramatic, and dark. Using dark chapters of human history as its cornerstone, the series creatively weaves drama, suspense, sci-fi, mystery, and theology into a strong and tantalizing tale of psychological and existential horror.<br /><br />These were all elements that were present in Season 1, which is also worth the time, and what is great with this series is that the seasons are not symbiotic or dependent upon the previous. The show is designed so that each season tells a tale of American horror in its entirety. Many of the talented actors that powered season 1 have returned as impressively dynamic different characters--namely Jessica Lange, Dylan McDermot, and Lily Rabe. This risky formula lends itself well almost subconsciously to the dream-like surreal atmosphere that the series cultivates.<br /><br />FX has a strong track record of producing shows that consistently push the envelope, and AHS is a strong testament to that. The predominance of criticism surrounding AHS, in this reviewers opinion, stems heavily from its ability to disturb. Fans of the inaugural season have ostensibly had difficulty backing season 2, and the strongest supporters of season 2 have argued that season 1 was not entirely successful. However that renders any critique of either season rather mute because they are written to stand on their own as uniquely different stories driven by different characters in different contexts with different motivation. Much like the forefathers of surreal horror television such as the Twilight Zone, Tales From the Crypt, etc., AHS has proven to be a dependable storytelling experience.<br /><br />If you are looking for something that guarantees safety and predictability, then AHS will most surely be a controversial, if not altogether alarming choice. But if you are looking for satiating and addictive psychological horror, then AHS stands alone as a work of art that is not easily forgotten.ooking for something that guarantees safety and predictability, then AHS will most surely be a controversial, if not altogether alarming choice.

B001NLKT60|5.0|In the true style of Stieg Larsson every page takes a different twist and turn.  I highly recommend this book, a must read.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|It's Nolan. Nothing he has ever done hasn't been good... except for Insomnia. That movie was awful. If you don't like this, you're not alive.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am not an opera/theatre expert, but I do enjoy good music when I hear it.  I have never seen a stage production of “The Phantom of the Opera”, only viewing an old movie picture starring Claude Rains, where he played the Phantom.  I did enjoy listening to “Music of the Night” whenever I heard it, so that when I saw that there was a recent movie version of the opera on Amazon directed by Joel Schumacher, I decided to view it.  It stars the lovely Emmy Rossum as Christine.  Ms. Rossum was only eighteen when she played that role.  Evidently she had some opera experience singing with Puccini, and she has a rather lovely soprano voice.  The music composed by Andrew Webber is magnificent and I thoroughly enjoyed the film.<br />Then I saw that Netflix had the stage production, so I decided to watch that to see what the difference was.  I was flabbergasted.  This is an extravagant production with wonderful sets and props that really drew you into the play.  This was a 25th Anniversary Celebration of Andrew Webber’s work.  At the end of the production there was a special treat wherein all the past actors who played the Phantom sang the Music of the Night.  The Royal Albert Hall in London is stunning and it was packed to the brim with thousands of patrons.  I understand that when it played (Fall 2011) they streamed it across the globe and thankfully they had the good sense to film it.<br />The principle actor/singers, Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom, Sierra Boggess as Christine, and Hadley Fraser as Raoul were excellent.  I must say that Sierra Boggess as Christine was extraordinaire, and the electricity between her and Ramin Karimloo was awesome.  Sierra Boggess’s soprano is out of this world, the beauty of the score sometimes bringing tears.  Some critics say that Sierra Boggess IS Christine, because of her talent in playing the role.  This production will blow your socks off.  I have purchased the Blu-Ray so that I can enjoy it over and over again at my pleasure.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|This bluray disc is a wonderful addition to my small collection.  One of the great epic Sergio Leone films with outstanding performances by Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson.  The bluray is crisp and the audio is luscious.  The film itself has aged nicely and remains an operatic masterpiece.
B008XNPO20|2.0|I bought the vinyl after I heard \\"feels like we only go backwards\\" on youtube. But I didn't expect all the other songs on the record to sound exactly the same. Sure, \\"apocalypse Dream\\", \\"keep on lying\\" and \\"elephant\\" are more memorizing than the rest. Flanger everywhere. I have nothing against Flanger but do you have to put it on every f*king song? It sounded very Dave Fridmann-heavy. Maybe it's just me but I got bored after side A1. And what's up with the 3-songs-per-side/double LP thing? It's annoying as hell. I thought the point of 12\\" is so that people don't have to get up every 10 minutes to flip the record. Anyway, I prefer a solid 5-song EP than a water-down 12-song LP anytime of the day. Just my .02 :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I found myself getting sucked in to these characters lives practically from page one!!  I wanted to keep reading and turning pages to find out what was going on with them. What had happened and what was going to happen to them!! Colleen Hoover spins a fascinating tale of young love through years of struggles and loss only to leave you breathless and almost not knowing what to cheer for toward the end!<br />Great read, it took me less than a day to finish it... what a great way to ring in the New Year! Treat yourself to an incredible book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of my favorite books last year.  Loved the back and forth in time from first person antagonist viewpoints --I can find this type of writing difficult to follow, in this case it was so well done that it enhanced the story. I was left for days later thinking about the characters, how we go through life, comparing self and how I would react to different situations.  Characters pulled me in and I still love them.  One of my 5 star requirements is a book that I'm thinking about the characters for a few days.  5 star.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Because I Like this kick ass type of material.  I also like the character of Mitch Rapp.  The overall believability is streching it but then it's only fantasy, so what.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|The second season looks even better than the first season, no doubt due to the change in film stock and rebuild of some of the sets. The extended &#34;Measure of a Man&#34; episode is worth the purchase, by itself.
B000YDAYHC|5.0|I purchased these for my son while he was in college in Boston.<br />Needless to say one of his favorite gifts...
B007PT1PEY|4.0|I'm a big fan of Sherlock and this book is a fun read. I bought it for $1 during an Amazon deal. More than worth it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You might think your life is bad but someone else always has it worse. This book makes you think about the little things in life that are more important, then the zip code you live in. Memories are far  better then anything in the world.<br />I love spending every waking minute with my husband and growing two year old. Life is really too short especially in today's society.<br />Well done again Mr. Sparks, well done.
B0081336FO|5.0|What can I say that the headline doesn't already convey. This show is amazing, much better than the american version. They keep you guessing the entire time making it fun to watch.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was a really good book up until the end. I was not a fan of how the book ended at all.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|After reading the reviews, I thought, why not? I like Harry Potter. I also like all the Percy Jackson/Heroes of OLympus series as well as Eragon. I have said ,ever since I read it, that Mark of Athena had the biggest cliffhanger at the end I had ever seen. Quest of Heroes blew Mark of Athena right out of the ballpark. I won't say why, but it is huge. I would recommend not reading it until the rest of the series comes out, but it is one of those books that leaves you begging on hands and knees for more. All in all, it is a great book.
B008RC72G8|5.0|I am being biased, I love any Tim Burton movie.Especially with Johnny Depp in it. All the actors worked well together.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Kind of confusing in some parts but i was able to follow along and enjoy the movie. I would probably watch again.
B005S9EK1S|4.0|All i can say is that the book, ofcourse, was alot better. However for what it was i thought it was a good flick. I wished they showed more interactions with Logan and his shepherd (like in the book). I think the chemistry the actors was very evident, alot of passion was showed in the movie. You can say that the &#34;high school musical' star definitely has been busy polishing his acting skills since the beginning of his careeer.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I was very happy with this book. I could not put it down, gillian Flynn is a great author. I look foward to reading more!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The first of the trilogy was more plausible.  As always, Mr. Follett's storytelling is superb but the coincidences regarding the five families  stretches credibility.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I have been disappointed about how expensive they are everywhere and when i saw it this cheap i jumped on the band wagon and got one and cannot stop watching them. Works Like a Dream<br /><br />- Huge Doctor Who Fan!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's captivating -- exciting -- historical, on the cutting edge of the change of our world as we knew it right during and after World War I -- if you are watching the third season on PBS (Sundays at 9am EAST) be sure to go back and watch seasons 1 and 2 from amazon!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Great film for inspiration, resurgence of bravery (lol), and personal sacrifice to lead a group to victory. Gibson does a great job!
B0076DELIG|5.0|The book is typical Harry Bosch.  You should read his early books first so you can follow along with the character.  Really good story, suspenseful and keeps you guessing.  Enjoyable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great.  There is plenty of variety so there is something for everyone.  You do not have to beat every game so if there is one you do not like you can just skip it.
B003L77GGA|5.0|The DVD's arrive on time, but the play like Chinese copies. The menu isn't the same a the originals I have.
B00122A28A|5.0|This was one of the first CD's I ever bought. I used to play it every day and my family thought I was depressed because it wasn't hip-hop or R&B. This CD reminds me of high school!

0307730697|5.0|Blehm, Eric. Fearless. Waterbrook Press, 2012. 257p. $21.99. 978-0-307-73069-5. 978-0-307-73071-8 (electronic).<br /><br />Fearless by Eric Blehm chronicles the life of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown from his childhood in Arkansas to his final mission in Afghanistan.  His early life and noble character are shaped in our minds through stories of his home life, friendships during his school years, and then choices that nearly destroyed him and landed him in jail.  His acceptance of Christ began his turnaround.  Much attention is given to the grueling training at each level of service, missions, setbacks and his courageous actions in service to his country.<br /><br />Blehm also devotes a fair amount of attention and gives respect to Brown's wife, Kelley.  As a military wife and mother, she played an important role in his life.  She provided a tranquil home environment where he could rest and regain his strength.  She supported him through prayer and action in the battle against his inner demons.  She also managed the household and attended to the children whenever duty called him away.<br /><br />In official paperwork detailing his last requests, Adam wrote that he wanted his family and those who knew him to share the whole truth about his spiritual journey.  It was important to him that the dark days were shared alongside the good times. He wanted to give honor and glory to God for the turnaround in his life.  His hope was that by revealing his personal demons others would take heart, accept Jesus, and renew the fight to overcome their own inner demons.<br /><br />I would recommend Fearless to those with an interest in the war against terrorism in the Middle East, the attacks of 9/11, contemporary covert military operations, individuals with an interest in joining any branch of our Armed Forces, and those with a heart to pray for our servicemen and servicewomen.  This title would make a fine addition to any Christian or military biography collection.<br /><br />NOTE:  I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review./>NOTE:  I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

B005K17RU0|3.0|I use accuweather on my desktop, and downloaded the app for my kindle fire. I like the looks of this app, and the features are basically just right. However, I use another product on my android phone - on which I also tried the accuweather app. I removed the accuweather app from my phone because the map was so slow to load. Same issue on my fire - painfully slow - and I can't find an option for a satellite map rather than the street map. The designers seemed to sacrifice speed for looks, but for weather apps for my fire, this is the best available.

B006BQFUOS|5.0|I bought this book when in France after seeing a plaque on a school honoring the children who had attended the school that were rounded up by the French Police and sent to camps during the Vel d'Hiv horror of 1942.  I remembered there was a movie made of the book and decided to see it after finishing the book.  It was very good with excellent performances.  I highlly recommend it, but would note that you'll have a much richer understanding of the background if you read the book first.
0307277453|5.0|I went to a Baptist college and studied science and religion. Old and new testments and the lost books of the bible. In my searching mind I knew that there had to be more a point and click explanation for our existance. I went to school to study chiropractic medicine. Did human dissection. Studied embroyology and I was completely absorbed in the similarities in all of the species. I have studied literature on all these subjects for years. I am 79 years old so it has been a long time. I have never read a treatise that put our existance so succinctly. Neil Shubin is my hero.<br />Dr. William H. Smith

B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Are you skeptical of five star ratings? They often look like they were written by the author's allies or undiscerning readers. Yet, To Sell Is Human deserves the full five stars.<br /><br />If you're in business, you may have noticed that the Internet has changed selling. Buyers now have smartphones with anywhere, anytime access to information. Thanks to social networks, they can share their thoughts instantly --- and the world listens.<br /><br />Yet sales training still seems so 1990s (or 1980s). The Internet means more than replacing faxes with emails, and building squeeze pages to answer objections. The trainers have had trouble adapting. Take a look at how they use social media. Are they showing ongoing generosity or just trying to get you on an email list?<br /><br />Dan Pink has the knack of spotting the future (e.g., A Whole New Mind). He's taken the time to research how selling has changed. He's developed an easy-to-remember framework that holds together surprisingly well (the new ABCs).<br /><br />What's more, Dan gives solid, practical DIY tips on how to sell today. Since we're all in selling, don't you want to get better? To Sell Is Human is a must read, a must re-read and a must act-upon. Highly recommended.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Just started playing these games and loving it. Love the challenge in each level and the graphics are cool as well. Definitely makes you think
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think that I'm very similar to Charlie. I don't drink or smoke or do anything promiscuous, but I've always thought of myself as a wallflower. Just there, watching everybody else fly through a great life. The end of the book surprised me although I felt as though there was something else going on throughout the book. I think it's a very honest book that many teens can connect with these days. And not only with drinking and problems like that, but with things like \\"participating\\". I really loved this book and would recommend it to anyone.
B001208QSA|5.0|I absolutely love the music from the Motion Picture 'The Hours'. It is a very relaxing soundtrack that any classical music lover would enjoy.
0765325950|5.0|I can not BELIEVE the average for this book is THREE STARS. What, are you people nuts? Did we read the same book? I can understand one or two minor annoyances (the only one I really had was the fulfillment of the Alivia foretelling). But everything was so amazingly wrapped up, and in such a clever, satisfying way, that I can't believe anybody gave this book less than at least four stars. Whatever.<br />Incidentally, one of the 1-star reviews that I read simply stated that they were mad that an ebook version was not yet released. I don't even think that stupid $#!@er read the damn book.<br />I have been waiting for this moment for almost twenty years, and I can't imagine it having been any better.

B0044DEAUA|5.0|Now this surprised me when I went to hook it up.  It worked the very first time and has ever since.  I like it because it beeps when my phone is close and beeps when I leave the promixmty.  Keeps track of me...  LOVE IT!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Since now they have the New York version I am addict to this game. I live in New York so I feel right in home in this game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I chose the 5 star rating because this book was beyond amazing. Even if you aren't big on reading, you would not be able to \\"put it down\\"....! I recommend this to every teen or adult!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Found the first dvd of the series follows the book very closely. I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A good read; it is hard to put down. Ken Follett is one of my favorite writers; he doesn't disappoint
B0014D6PCO|3.0|Of the three latest Batman flicks, this one is probably the most visually interesting.  However, it lacks the &#34;comic-booky&#34; feeling (good examples are Superman and The Crow) that I prefer in movies of this genre.  The acting is not terrible, but Mr. Nolan needs to find stronger female leads.  Overall, it was entertaining, but I won't be watching it a second time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Better than the first and excited to start the third!!! I can't wait to see how it all comes to an end!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a voracious devourer of dystopian novels, and it took me far, far too long to find Wool.  I couldn't put it down.  The characters were thoughtfully developed and believable - something that is often lacking in modern fiction (in my opinion, anyway - I'm picky).  I can't wait to get into Books 6 and 7, and I am eagerly awaiting the release of future novel/novellas.  Mr. Howey has sated in me a void for good dystopian fiction that doesn't involve overwhelming world politics or zombies (which I also like, don't get me wrong - I own his other book, I, Zombie).  I look forward to reading the rest of his series.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I love Rothfuss' series, beginning with, &#34;The Name of the Wind&#34;. This picks up where &#34;Wind&#34; left off. Would have given 5, maybe 6 stars, except for a prolonged discussion of love and sex and monogamy between the main character and the love interest. Those sections of dialog were for the writer's benefit, not the reader. That aside, this is a damned good book and a particularly compelling series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it is a decent app. i have had it for almost a year it wwakes me up every morning and i have had no problem with it so far
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Good movie, good ending. I like dark stories. The movie never lagged and I'l;l watch it again when it's on TV.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I really enjoy the main characters and have been following the series since it started. Looking forward to the next book.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I've read all the other Scarpetta books and while the earlier ones were my favorites this one is far better than the last two which didn't keep me engaged.  I liked this book, but it took a long time to really get going and then it was hard to put down (starting about 1/3 of the way into the book when all the pieces started to fit better together). The relationships that Kay has with her niece and husband are not as flushed out as other books, but both are key players in this book while Kay solves the latest horrific crime which is why I liked this book more.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it's a four because it's a great fun portalble version of minecraft but for me it loses a star because you can't do anything with redstone
B005DJGMQE|5.0|I think of myself as a fairly educated man with a decent grasp of American History.<br /><br />I am ashamed to say that the story of this trial was completely unfamiliar to me. How such an important event became shrouded within the life and death of Lincoln is probably a testament to our lacking education system. The 'abridged' history that's become our accepted, common curriculum seemingly stops at the assassination for all those but intense history buffs. What a disservice to our youth that this event, regardless of Mary Surrat's guilt or innocence, will likely stay in the outer fringes of History as most know it.<br /><br />Brilliant and effortless acting, coupled with a deeply compelling tale, has forged a new respect from this reviewer of Redford's work. A really entertaining film that does not drag or bog down. 124 minutes flew by. Bravo!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Excellent movie from storyline to actors and all else. Love the easy and quick access to movies with amazon prime membership.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I bought this book after its author tweeted a review about it by Doug A. After reading Doug A's not so glamorous review I thought I better see what all the fuss was about. Here's my thoughts on the book...<br /><br />I'm certainly no business teacher or fortune 500 exec however I am a \\"starter\\" and an employee in the software industry. I've had a great deal of success with my small company and have done so by following a number of the things I learned in Getting Real (another book by Jason). Although this book (Rework) reiterates a number of the concepts from Getting Real there is a definite separation between the two titles.<br /><br />This book uses a great number of analogies to teach different concepts and is really well written. The reason the book is only a couple hundred pages is because that's all it needs to be. If you can read and haven't read this book yet, you should; it's that good!<br /><br />Thanks Doug A. for motivating me to read an awesome book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed book could not put it down. That's why I gave it five stars,kept me on edge of seat. Can't wait to read book three.
098555780X|5.0|This is a great book to get you started with paracord, or to add onto your knotty knowledge.  Very well written and organized.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent writing. Extremely creative. One of the best books I have read in a while. A must read for those who are murder mystery lovers.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|One would think with all these very good actors that one would get a good movie, or at least good acting in the movie. Guess again. I fell asleep 1/2 into the movie and when I woke up, I hadn't missed anything. It was boring when fell asleep and was boring when I woke up. The kid from Slumdog millionaire really proved that being directed well brings out good performances, which was true for Slumdog; not so much for this movie. The idea was cute but skip the movie. The trailer has all the highlights and anything good in the movie. Save your digital dollars on this one.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I loved the operatic movie, the music, and acting. I couldn't wait to get the soundtrack. I was disappointed that the case was cracked upon arrival. Thankfully, though, the CD was not harmed, scratched or cracked.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Everything about this set is 5-star except the extras on the Blu-Ray disc.  I would have liked longer \\"making of\\" sections with more information about the SFX which were pretty near flawless.  This is clearly the way to go if you want to own the best-looking version of \\"The Avengers\\" you can currently get, but don't expect more than 30min of total extras.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|I had never heard of this movie, but Amazon was offering it for such a low price I thought might as well.  Great movie, great price, what more could you ask for?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this was so much more than that.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This really captured my emotions, and I couldn't put it down.  I stayed up until 5am to finish it, and immediately purchased the other book by Colleen Hoover.  A great read.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I could have easily put the book down, but I wanted to find out what really happened in Gideon's past. My friend told me to keep reading so I did. I might read the last book, but I'm not waiting impatiently for it to come out.  It's all TOO MUCH.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very good story and mainly an exercise of imagination thinking about our life without technology. Very interesting also the picture of the american life in the 60's
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addicting fun game! Silly how exciting it is when the coins fall but there you have it! Love that it was free!
0385335989|5.0|This book was so much cheaper online that if bought new.  Although it was stated as being used it certainly didn't look used at all.
0765325950|2.0|No matter how bad this book was, I would have bought it.<br />That being said, I was dissappointed after having turned the last page after having been taken on close to a 20 year journey. I was happy with the ending, but felt that it was incredibly rushed, especially in the last 50 pages. After what seemed like a natural pace, I got the feeling that Sanderson realized he was already at 850 pages and said to himself, crap and quickly wrapped up all the story lines.<br /><br />I never would have believed I would be saying this, but I almost feel like there needed to be another book, or at least another couple of hundred pages to let things wrap up clean.
B004D2GMR6|5.0|Gift on relative's wish list so I knew he would like it if he was the one who picked it out.  Easy to Christmas shop from my home.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I am very impressed with the interface of this app.  Makes finding new music an easy experience.  It is a bit higher priced than TuneIn Radio, but I think it is well worth it.  I'm still exploring around with it, so I may update with some criticism later.  For now, it is my go-to music app.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Twisted and fun! Love the characters and the acting! Sad that it'll all be over soon. Absolutely brilliant. Can't wait for season 3.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. If you like this, also try Addicted by Zane. That was the original kinky tale. Just as great...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wanted this book for a long time. Finally got it for Christmas and it did not disappoint! Thoroughly enjoyed thus book!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A great read that I had difficulty putting down. I am not majorly into running, but still enjoyed the book. Served as good inspiration.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|It's a good book for a light reading. You have the tipical love story, but with a twist. You can find action, romance and surprise. But don't forget: it's a novel written for teenagers, so don't ask too much.
1567184855|5.0|have read it twice now. found everything i had previously suspected was related in this book which gives me the idea that some truths have been revealed. (i am the husband of the club member)
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Fits the Kindle Fire perfectly without being too big or bulky.  Cover protects the screen well and also works as a stand.<br /><br />Very satisfied.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|this was well worth the wait and price! loved it. the problem solving and hidden objects. plus the story line was good. another good one for g5! cant wait for the next one.
0765325950|1.0|I had pre-ordered this book for my father's Christmas present. He has been reading the series since the mid 90's and was VERY excited to get it. I want to clarify that my review is simply based on the quality of the book, not the story line.<br /><br />When I received the book, 4 days after it's release, I immediately gave it to him. He called me this afternoon to inform me that 50 pages are missing. 50 PAGES! Robert Jordan's story lines are known for their need to pay attention. Missing a single paragraph can be crucial, much less 50 pages worth.<br /><br />According to my father, the story is magnificent none the less. Regardless, 50 pages are missing. Poor job Amazon, poor job.<br /><br />I would return, but I had signed the book as it was a gift.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|This book was amazing, very good read! I chose this book because I enjoy reading about peoples lives. I would recomend this book to anyone who like biographys.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This cover is easy to use and does a great job of keeping my kindle standing up. It also keeps food from getting on my screen.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|Definitely read the books first if you can. The movies are great, and engulf you with the story of love, good vampires and werewolves, but the books give you even more.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was hesitant at first to download the app, but friend says it great....what a way to share pics and follow others.....it is quite addicting !
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Definitely read the books first if you can. The movies are great, and engulf you with the story of love, good vampires and werewolves, but the books give you even more.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|2 Broke Girls has become a favorite of mine.  I purchased this season so my best friend could watch and see what I keep talking about.  Quality of product was great and processing and delivery was prompt.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Michael Keaton, Geena Davis, Catherine O'Hara, Winona Ryder, Jeffrey Jones in a Tim Burton movie, with Alec Baldwin.  The Banana Boat Song...say no more.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Well, I said 1 star because my Kindle Fire wont let me download it and I don't know if that is my device or the app.... Its probably my Kindle Fire.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A great, great documentary about the thieving, greedy, immoral Wall Street and bankers.  Movies like this should be required watching starting at high school age, to show just how corrupt America and capitalism can get without proper transparency and regulations.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Downloaded the app to my Kindle fire because I love the game. The app is great and easy to play but I hate the adds you get every time you start a new game. Sometimes you have to go back to your home page to get out of the add, a real pain. I guess thats how you pay for this \\"free\\" app. Otherwise I really love the game and would give it 5 stars except for the adds.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|The story is tight, well thought through and never strays from the framework. One or two surprises which made me think about this book long after I'd finished it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the best one I ever played! It could not get any gunner then this. I hope there is a second Free Flow because,  if not they need to make one fast. I can't but my kindle for nothing unless I have something to do!!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and the way everything wrapped up in the end. I love the writhing style and the character development throughout the series. I hope the movies keep close to the books.
B000F8O2PG|5.0|My husband and I are big fans of SG-1 and enjoy the entire series.  We think each season is as good as the last.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I liked the movie.... ... ... . ..... .. ... ... ... ....... ............ ............ ..... .... .... that's it !
B004G600A4|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my niece.  She loves the movie and was happy to add it to her collection.
B000LC55F2|1.0|I bought it because the actors are usually always good, but the movie is very negative to the point that I had to turn it off.
B004E547D8|5.0|My husband and I have watched this several times and still laugh out loud at a lot of the scenes.  This plot about retired CIA, M6 and KBG agents reuniting to fight a foe that is killing off a specific list of CIA agents is never dull, full of surprises and great humor.
B009SPUSN2|1.0|You don't need to spend $20 on a CD you can download FROM THE MAKERS' WEBSITE for free.<br /><br />[...]save yourself some money
1439153663|4.0|Very sad and tragic story with no relief until the very end.  A lot of abuse and dying.  Still, I came to feel like I knew these people, so I couldn't put the book down.  Grissom has a way of pulling the reader in.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure if this was going to be my cup of tea but once I got started I couldn't put the book down. Riveting storyline and relatable characters made for an excellent read.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wow!!!!!  What courage!  To test ones greatness and find such peace.  No fear.  Just desire.  I couldn't put it down.  Wow!!!<br />One never knows what lies ahead. You must take that step and step she did!  If only all of us could slow down and take a step , only then, would we find our strength!<br />Thank you for giving us a glimpse into your world!  It was awesome  to walk with you!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|When I am at home I prefer to listen to the complete Led Zeppelin albums, but, if you are going on a road trip &#34;You Must Get This&#34;. It was meant for the road in my opinion. The DVD is a great bonus!!!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|fun game. although a bit short more levels please make them a little bit harder next time was too easy to finish in one sitting
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I bought this set for my husband's birthday - we've been having a Harry Potter movie fest over this past weekend and couldn't be happier with the product.<br /><br />The product doesn't contain much else other than the movies themselves, but if you don't have to have the biggest and baddest collection, who cares? These movies are great quality and play well. The discs work great in our player. A couple of the movies - Year 7 - appears to have special features, which is great!<br /><br />It's a wonderful collection - it comes in a standard sleeve with 4 DVD cases - two DVDs per case. For example, the first and second films are in the same DVD case, and so on. The last film (both parts) are in a case of their own with what appears to be two special features discs.<br /><br />The entire product came shrink-wrapped, and appears to be brand new. I love it!
0765325950|5.0|Fantastic read from start to finish.<br /><br />Hardcover is better than the ebook, and people giving 1 star ratings simply because of the delayed ebook release date are ill founded.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this anthology for my husband as a Christmas gift. We absolutely LOVE the packaging. The DVDs are in their own sections within this packaging. It comes with a flip full-color booklet that tells little facts and summaries of all of the films. The large case that the discs come in is beautifully designed. This product is very high quality. I highly, highly recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After reading the first 2 books, I lost interest in book 3 early and only glanced through the second half.In general, I felt that these books were not particu;laily  well written and boardered on pornography, which doesn't interest me!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I bought this movie for my grandmother for Christmas. One of her most favorite things is a good period piece movie.<br /><br />What I love most about this movie is the acting - all of the parts are acted SO well. The costumes are gorgeous. I also love that they provide some history in the movie along with everything, so you get a genuine idea of what it was like and what happened during the reign and life of Queen Victoria.<br /><br />It's an amazing movie about real love, one of the best love stories I've ever seen, and the best part is, it's a REAL love story.<br /><br />Emily Blunt is such a talented actress. See this movie, if you love period pieces, this is a must-have for you!
B00A757EFW|3.0|Not free, which was a big deal to someone on a low budget. Make the game free, make additional cool levels or custom skins cost money.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|As funny as I remember. Al, Peggy, and the whole cast were just as hilarious as I remembered. This is a great collection. I highly recommend it.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Have been using my computer for 15 days, processor seems to be fine and operating at low temperatures. Thank you!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Love this movie, watched it many times and still could.  Great for kids of all ages, no worries.  Laughs keep coming!
B00004R99F|5.0|My son's new favorite movie!  The scene with Bigfoot is the best!  Nothing like watching bigfoot dance to 70's music!!!
B008SLAXGO|5.0|Fun book, only pictures, but pics of all sorts of things during her monster ball tour.  Sleeping, getting dressed, crying, dancing, yoga, very real and very raw.  But all in all, good book, GF loved it.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I feel this is one of the best games for kids to use their imagination!  You look at the picture and try to make it out of legos!!  Makes kids really think!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Love this series, i love zombies, however this season is a lot slower than the 1st, its still worth it to fill in the story.  Can't wait til season 3 is for sale!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A warrior can be a gentleman and a Christian. There was honor in the skies over Germany at least in this true story.
B009MF56GC|5.0|The action scenes are top notch.  If your looking for a well placed story and jaw dropping dialog, this isn't the movie.  This movie is Bada$$ action, campy one liners, and huge 80's stars mixed with a couple of todays top stars.  I won't spoil or talk much about the plot, but i will say, if you want a cool fast paced action movie thats fun, this is it!
B003PVPXOE|5.0|Better each time I watch this.Holden and von Stroheim were superb. Swanson at her overacting best.  Great cameos by DeMille, Hedda Hopper and others.  Jack Webb in a &#34;whoever thought he would amount to anything&#34; role.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Bought this show for my GF for Xmas, she was excited to get it and wanted to watch it right away.  I did NOT want to watch a show with fairy tale characters and princesses and whatnot, but to apease her i did.  And right from the end of the 1st episode, i found myself hooked.  Very nicely done, great actors, and loved how they go between the stories, over all, amazing!<br /><br />If your not sure, then give it a try,  you may be surprised, just like i was.
B009329Y30|5.0|this is a great movie,good love story a little risky for young teenagers but would definitely recommend and watch it again....
B0072OFOM6|5.0|The show and story hook can't be beat, ties maybe from some of my other favs, but this show, the fighting, the sex, the power, all suck me in.  I don't know how much longer it can go on, but im excited to see.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Left too many open paths. Focused too much on the aliens. Dr. Arden and Judy's relationship was building to something great, then just fizzled out.
B0062HS03O|5.0|Not a fan, GF is, but this concert was fun and she doesn't look half bad either.  She is entertaining, thats for sure.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really like this book! Can wait to read the third book. Thank you for writing these books.  It help in many ways!!!!!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This game of UNO is lots of fun and keeps you alert when calling out &#34;UNO&#34; when playing the second to last card.
1402713185|5.0|Very very good.  We tried the original version for our 6 yr old granddaughter and it was too difficult to read to her.  So we got this one and it was sooo much better for both of us!
B000002BE9|4.0|There are only two albums by her I can stomach. The other one is \\"When The Pawn...\\" which is more upbeat. But this one is very calm sounding pretty much throughout. I love her lyrics which paint pictures and make her seem all the more intelligent. The album is pretty downbeat but there are two or so songs that are more upbeat (\\"Criminal\\" and \\"The First Taste\\"). The album is kind of intense but without making you feel tense. If you like sad music then you will be at ease. Some of the best tracks to me are \\"Sleep To Dream\\", \\"Sullen Girl\\", \\"Pale September\\" and \\"Carrion\\". I do like Fiona's voice and think her range is decent but sometimes she goes a little off-key. Her voice is pretty unique though just like her look. I say the CD's a keeper.<br /><br />4.4 stars.
B001E45XT4|5.0|My son wanted a headset and I picked this due to price.  He has used it ever since we purchased it and loves it.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|The movie dragged on and on. I was completely expecting a better movie. Very dissatisfied with the production and and plot.
B0049J0DC8|3.0|I finally watched this with my two young children, and was surprised at certain parts.  The movie is fine, it has that fever pitch that is quite anxiety producing for children, rather than just exciting.  Woody certainly does far more name calling (\\"idiot! stupid!\\") than I think is necessary.  Bo Peep is one of the only female characters in this film, and though she's helpful and thoughtful, she's also really interested in romancing Woody, a typical sexualization of a minor female character.  My kids also wanted to know WHY the neighbor kid was so awful (his sister isn't).  It's unfortunate that he doesn't come to recognize any feelings or have any consequences/conclusions that resolve his behavior- rather he's scared out of his 'bad ways'.  Certainly there are some lessons here that are valuable- not judging a book by its cover (as with the cobbled together toys) as well as showing that you may end up being friends with people you'd never expect, and that friendships can be complicated (and luckily if you yell at them and call them names, they still can forgive you).  To see toys that kids may recognize (like Little People) was fun for the kids, but otherwise I don't think it's a movie that they or I will really wish to see again and again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my favorite game, I play it every night before I go to bed.  Very relaxing, thanks for having it for my kinder fire HD<br /><br />I would recommend this game to all my friends
0670022705|5.0|i choose my rating because the book came on time and was in great condition or in the condition i excepted it to be in.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|I thought this was a great  movie.  Just something cute and fun to watch (so many movies these days are so stupid or really heavy).  Saw this on vacation and liked it so much I purchased it to share with the fam during the holidays.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I live this series so much, it is has so many twist and turns! It is like a good book that you can't put down. Love it
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I played this game on my Kindle Fire (first generation)  and it worked very well. The graphics were amazing. The hidden object part of the game was excellent. No miniscule or obscured or darkened scenes that would frustrate or infuriate me, as I have been with other hidden object games I have played lately. The puzzles are interesting and can sometimes be challenging.  There is a skip button available if needed.  The story line is interesting and moves you along scene by scene. The hint button can be used to direct you if you are unsure which direction to go next. There is a built in guide on the left side of the screen that can be accessed if needed.  The game was longer than I expected for the $2.99 price. A well executed game with amazing graphics. I certainly would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the adventure hidden object puzzle type games. I look forward to the sequel!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this novel as it delves into the silent and personal world of abuse.  What the main charactors endured bespeaks what many are ashamed to admit . Awesome---due to it's intuitive content. Would recommend &#34;Safe Haven&#34; to anyone.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I just love this show! It is so well done. I love the twist to the original tales! I hope this show continues for a long time.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is just plane funny and exciting. One of Jeff's best books. But I do feel bad for Greg considering all the hard work he did.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Over all good solid gaming mouse, especially with the extra weights provided. Nice solid feel, nothing cheap about it. Made for people with bigger hands I think, The only flaws that I can find is the the DPI button is way too easy to hit accidently and when it happens in the middle of a firefight you're gonna die every time. It doesn't come with any instructions so I dont know how to program the macro-switches or activate them other than accidently, that's annoying. Would probably be a great mouse for the fantasy based games like warcraft and such and for that genre of games I would reccomend it, Unfortunately I play FPS and while it's a decent mouse it needs like 2-3 more programmable buttons available and some sort of DPI lock or button relocation to be a 5 star mouse for me. I'll hang on to it but the search for the best FPS mouse goes on...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Dysfunctional relationship at its rarest level. Interesting read. Not for innocent eyes.<br />Ending is a let down but aren't they all?
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|not bad - better than I thought it would be actually...there was some actual thought put into the script I thought.
B008X9Z37A|2.0|The delivered product was comprised of stiff cardboard covered  in fabric.  The product was highly overpriced for the merchandise delivered.  It was also hard to discern the composition of the product from the presentation and description on the Amazon web page.
B006WAIV6M|4.0|This book is a real eye opener. We keep trying to change our behavior by focusing on actions, which is not just frustrating, but also short lived. This book gives an excellent insight on how to get the undesirable action patters completely out of our lives. The presentation is lucid and full of relevant examples. Perhaps the only thing that was missing to some extent was a more concrete action plan on changing habits. Still, the book is excellent, and provides a good start to anybody trying to make his or her life better.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I'm not a big Jim Carey fan but love this movie and so do my grandchildren.  Disney did a great job on this one.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|great show, watch it every night, i like the twists and turns and it keeps you guessing. they keep getting in trouble
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing the game much like I've always played on my computer or just with a deck of cards.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I enjoy that it shares the amount of time I have until my device will shut off. Perfect for on the go when j won't be  back for a few hrs to conserve the battery.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|This was a gift I purchased for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She has enjoyed it since receiving it on Christmas day.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It keeps you engaged.  The characters are well written and contribute to the plot.<br />Can't wait for movie and next book.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I've read other books by Philippa Gregory, but The Kingmaker's Daughter is my favorite by far. Well-researched and entertaining, it covers the life of Anne Neville and her sister Isabel, daughters (and pawns) of the \\"Kingmaker\\" a powerful nobleman who was responsible for putting Edward of York on the throne and later conspired to take him off it and replace him with his brother.<br /><br />The Kingmaker's Daughter is the latest addition to the \\"Cousin's War\\" series that takes place during the \\"War of the Roses\\" (just before the Tudors came to power) which consists of (besides this newest title):<br /><br />[[ASIN:1451660790 The Lady of the Rivers]]: a novel about Jaquetta Duchess of Bedford whose daughter Elizabeth Woodville secretly marries King Edward<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004VSSBJE The White Queen]]: introduces us to Elizabeth Woodville and covers her fight to help her family rise to power after her marriage to King Edward, as well as the disappearance of her sons from the Tower of London<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003LL3KQQ The Red Queen]]: a novel about Margaret Beaufort who who marries Edmund Tudor and pours her ambition into her son Henry (Margaret was Henry VIII's grandmother)<br /><br />[[ASIN:1451626096 The White Princess]]:  Coming out in August of 2013, this book will cover Princess Elizabeth, Elizabeth Woodville's daughter<br /><br />Supposedly, there is also going to be a T.V. drama produced by the STARZ network sometime this year in 2013.<br /><br />Each of the books covers a different perspective of this time period (mid to late 1400's). If you've read the other books, you won't be surprised by what happens (it's based on the same piece of history with all the same major players, after all), but having the different view points adds a dimension of understanding and interest to each one that makes them well worth reading as a series. The characters that you hate in one book, you love in another. ;-) It really goes to show you there are two (or more!) sides to every story. Having said that though, you do NOT have to have read any other books in the Cousin's War series in order to understand what's going on. The Kingmaker's Daughter is perfect as a stand-alone.<br /><br />The Kingmaker's Daughter starts out with Anne and Isabel as children and follows them through their lives (for about 20 years or so) during the turbulent events of the War of Roses. Other reviews have covered elements of the plot so I won't discuss that other than to say The Kingmaker's Daughter is well-researched and seems to be fairly accurate with, of course, a bit of personal interpretation. All of the main incidents of the War of Roses (including the disappearance of the \\"nephews in the tower\\") is contained within the pages as viewed through the eyes of Anne.<br /><br />For much of the book Anne is fairly young. The story starts out with her as an 8 year old and much of the book is centered around her life as a teen (since she was married at 14). Interaction between Anne and her sister is a pendulum swinging from devoted sisterly love to sibling rivalry & drama. However, despite the fact that the book covers the two sisters, it's really more about Anne. I found the dialogue and events to be realistic. Philippa does a terrific job at capturing a depth to Anne as she matures from a child into a young woman who wants a hand in her destiny but is swept up in the events of the time and the constraints of 15th century society. Philippa made me care about Anne and her world. She also portrayed Richard the III in a sympathetic way instead of the evil monster who murdered his nephews, as I've read in other books.<br /><br />One thing that was a welcome surprise was there there are zero bodice ripping, tawdry romance scenes in this book. In fact, this book was so \\"clean\\" that I would readily recommend it to a Y.A. (young adult) reader who is interested in historical fiction. I'm an adult who is a regular reader of Y.A. titles and think it would appeal to that age group since Anne is young throughout most of the book (and even when she is an adult she retains much of the same voice). This is not a \\"kiddy romp\\" though. There is still plenty of history and depth along with complicated relationships and history to keep any lover of historical fiction interested, no matter what the age. To clarify, there are intimate relationships portrayed - just that they are more implied than described. I cover potentially objectionable material for younger readers in more detail on my blog & website book reviews section, which can be accessed from my website (see my profile).<br /><br />As for detail and world building, I think Philippa did an admirable job. I felt immersed in the story and while it's very dialogue and character driven, there is plenty of world building through the first-person observations of Anne. There is plenty of detail, but it never mires the book down. I also felt like Anne was realistically portrayed for her time period. She didn't feel like a modern girl/woman plopped down into historical fiction and yet she was very accessible as a character.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of Philippa Gregory's books, I recommend starting with this one. It will give you a great introduction to a well-loved author. If you have, you may find, like I did, that The Kingmaker's Daughter quickly becomes your favorite of Gregory's books. After reading the Kingmaker's Daughter (in one evening as I didn't want to put it down), I promptly bought the other books I haven't read yet in this series and will soon be devouring them as well. :-)e group since Anne is young throughout most of the book (and even when she is an adult she retains much of the same voice).

030758836X|3.0|I got into this book very quickly and had plans of giving it rave reviews.  I did not understand some of the bad reviews.  She ruined the book in the last part.  Like another reviewer had said, I felt like I was robbed of my time by the time I finished the book.  It didn't even seem like it was the same author.  Almost like one author wrote parts one and two.  Excellent.  Someone took over to hurriedly come up with some unrealistic garbage for part 3.  How disappointing.  I would have put one star for a wrap-up review, but I really did like the first two parts.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book started as a typical teen romance and I was a little confused about what all the five star reviews were about. Then it got gut-wrenchingly intense. Well-written, beautifully convoluted, and I've still got tears in my eyes. This is one of those books you'll refuse to stop reading (I read it start to finish in a day). Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Can't rave enough.

0439023521|4.0|After having the unfortunate experience of reading \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", this was a welcomed treat back into the world of books written well, where there was a plentiful supply of characters that I actually enjoyed and wanted to follow on their journey.  I look forward to the next two books in the series.  I ordered them about half way through this one, knowing then that I was going to want to know what continued to happen in this world.  I highly recommend the book, even if you have seen the movie.  I saw the movie first, but still found the book to be highly enjoyable.  It was well plotted, the pacing was near perfect, and the details painted a far better image than the movie ever did.

B001JTJNVI|2.0|Sadly I missed the fact that this book was a paperback book, and not a durable hardback. In my rush to purchase items for Christmas, I missed this information or would NEVER have spent this much for a non-durable book.  Lesson learned.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love these movies!  They are fun to watch!  Probably because they are older movies but the Blu Ray quality could be better.  There is way too much snow and video noise for me.  Not crystal clear like you'd expect.  I have a 10 foot 3D 1.07 Billion colors projection screen and frankly, I was very dissappointed with the grainy pic.  On my 60 inch LG plasma it looks great!  Still, I recommend this set to everyone.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The game is just as irritating and addicting as the carnival version. The slow regeneration of the coins is annoying, but it has not kept me from playing. It's a nice game if you're doing something else that requires your attention but need something to help pass the time. My main complaint is the ads at the bottom make hitting the home key difficult.

Not only is this a good book for yourself. Also for learning what company's do to manipulate you into doing what they want. I did know some of the information in this book but I did learn a lot. This is a must read!

B006LSZECO|2.0|Gone Girl is an extremely well-written novel about the most awful people I can imagine. I disliked the characters so much that I nearly didn't finish reading the book. (An exception: One character actually tries to do the right thing, but she's overwhelmed by the rest of them.) However the excellent writing, and the vain hope that someone would have some tiny redeeming factor, kept me going.

I've been so used to her great storytelling songs, that are interesting and meaningful I felt Red would be no different.  Sadly, there wasn't any good stories being told.  It wasn't interesting.  There was WAY too much repeating the same words/chorus over and over and over, it was very annoying....  it got on my nerves.  I don't recommend this album.  I don't listen to it.

B004P1JEWU|3.0|I came to this book virtually a fantasy virgin, motivated only by a desire to know what happened after the second season of the TV show. Some may consider it somewhat sacrilegious to pick up the series on book three and in hindsight (having now finishing book five) I wish I'd started at the beginning.<br /><br />The writing annoyed me at first. Irritatingly descriptive and filled with cheap attempts at \\"medieval\\" language like \\"half a hundred\\" instead of \\"fifty\\", and nerdy invented words like \\"roundtower\\" instead of \\"round tower\\", GRRM's prose feels lumbering and clumsy. His insistence that every character \\"break his fast\\", instead of just eating \\"BREAKFAST\\" made me shudder every time I read it. Which happened probably half a hundred times.<br /><br />Still, what got me in the end was the structure. Each chapter is told from the third person perspective of a different character, and the slow building of interlocking plots and end-of-chapter cliffhangers made it nearly unputdownable, which was a curse as the book is so huge. Structurally the story is a mirror of Irvine Welsh's \\"Porno\\", albeit with far more characters and slightly less anal sex. The other redeeming feature was GRRM's fearlessness in killing off main characters. As a reader you feel very insecure and read every battle with a real sense of tension knowing that no one is safe.<br /><br />Reading it on a kindle was kind of depressing as you only have the percentage numbers to keep track of your progress - rather than physical pages, so you can be reading for half an hour before you finally click over a percentage point - and then at 94% the book suddenly finishes and you realise you were not prepared - frustrating and demoralising. (But in no way a reason to go back to those dusty, crippled tools of the dark ages).<br /><br />I read GoT3 at the same time as Jane Austin's Sense and Sensibility and I highly recommend doing the same. Whereas Austin had a command of english that GRRM can only fap over, not heaps happens in her books, so when you get bored with beautifully written parlour intrigue, you can switch back over to rape and murder. Unfortunately I was only 44% through GoT when I finished S&S and was forced to endure the remaining 1000 or so pages uninterrupted.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|I tend to enjoy books from a young adult 's perspective, as I am a young adult myself. As far as the writing itself goes, Chbosky did a great job writing from the perspective of a sensitive, thoughtful, 15-year old boy. Repeated use of words such as \\"incidentally\\" made the writing seem rather childish, which I believe was the author's intention.<br /><br />Considering the perspective of the book, I expected to like it more than I did. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The format of the book, being letters that the speaker sent to an anonymous recipient, limited the story in a bad way for me. I felt like I spent too much time stuck in Charlie's head with his never-ending, deep, meaningful thoughts. It's quite painful to read at times, like digging through your old, embarrassing high school diary.<br /><br />The title of the book says it all: the speaker, being a wallflower, is so wrapped up in his own head that it is frustrating. I still enjoyed the book, but I'm not sure I understand \\"the perks\\" of being a wallflower at all.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book starts off as an amusing and engaging story told from the point-of-view of a teenage boy, Jacob Portman. It later develops into a fantasy/horror story, so I recommend this book to readers aged 12 and up.<br /><br />Following the death of his grandfather in unusual circumstances, Jacob sets off to England in an attempt to solve the mystery of his grandfather's dying words. He goes in search of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, where his grandfather was raised until the onset of World War II. The Home is the setting of numerous stories Jacob's grandfather told him as a child, featuring a levitating girl, an invisible boy and a cast of other unusual characters. Are these stories real or a figment of his grandfather's imagination? Whilst Jacob initially believes his grandfather's stories, he begins to lose his faith as he grows older.<br /><br />Jacob's search leads him to encounter a spooky mansion, a shape-shifter, children with peculiar powers, cannibalistic monsters, creepy photographs, a love story, and a bit of time travel. With all these elements, this book is sure to please young and old alike.<br /><br />The book features original vintage photographs collected by the author and his friends. It is a credit to the author's imagination that he came up with this story based on the photographs. Some readers have expressed difficulty in viewing the photographs and hand-written letters in the eBook version. However, I had no difficulty whatsoever using my Nexus 7 tablet.<br /><br />Whilst this story in itself is complete, the author has left it open to a sequel.

B0071LLHGC|4.0|5 stars would be to say it brought the same fire as live at the Fillmore East.  It doesn't but its still a great listen and Duane is there and that alone is worth your time.  The high bar for most any live recording back in that period would almost have to be Live at the Fillmore East. Impeccable in every way and on on my list of the 20 records you take to a desert island. A and R doesn't quite reach to that high mark but, you can see if from here. For any ABB fan this is a must have. Its clean and crisp and when you let the volume go, it unleashes the rhythm section. All the essential parts are there. Like the loss of Jimi it too leaves you wondering what could have become of this band had its pieces remained in tack.  Bottom line.... get this recording.

B0094K1K42|1.0|Marketed as a comedy, but nothing is really funny. It tries to be a dark comedy but fails by just making you depressed.  The character she plays is stupid and doesn't really have any admirable qualities, so there is no reason to care for her...

159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver is a skilled mathematician and statistician.  In a way that most others do not, he uses his skills to predict things such as the outcome of presidential elections.  In the 2012 election he used national and state-wide polling data to anticipate a solid Obama win.  I guess Republicans were not reading him, since they were surprised by the outcome of the election.  In this book Silver explains how careful assessment of data leads to reliable predictions, but sloppiness does not.  He also shows the logic of why some things are predictable and others are not.  The book makes sense.
B0097PW7H8|4.0|This is not a fancy app, but very useful for monitoring and caring for your battery life.  The Kindle Fire, especially, runs through power faster than the &#34;old&#34; first Kindles, so this helps keep on track.
B000JML7EC|4.0|Never read the book before and enjoyed. Since it's free I guess I could live with the slight editing issues.
B00AOOIIVA|4.0|As always a wonderful Tim burton movie... A little scary for our 4 year old but she watched the whole thing and days later is still talking about it! Purchased so will be watchingany more times.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had seen marketing for this series but had not been particularly drawn to it.  But, with the impending Season 3, I read that even Michelle Obama wanted the scoop on what would be happening.  I thought, OK I have got to see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />I am hooked!!! I love all the characters, the writing, the direction, the imagery, the performances!!  It is wonderful and addictive.  I hope this series runs for a very long time.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|The perfect Christmas present for my father who is a big fan of all Steve Mcqueen movies especially this one!
B009AJD5E0|3.0|Some impressive scenes. Good special effects. However, too many correlations to the original Aliens movie.<br />Characters personalities/behaviors difficult to believe given their assignments and qualifications.<br />This could have been a great movie. Just too many dejavu's for me. And, I LOVE sci-fi!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Pitch Perfect certainly exercises a little raunch, but it is written with a deft hand and not over the top like Bridesmaids. The genuine likability of this ensemble cast in combination with quirky, sometimes outrageous humor made this a highly entertaining watch.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down! I started it at 8 last night and have not been able to put it down since, and just finished. I couldnt wait to get to every new page!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to start reading this series because of all the hype about it--I usually avoid some of the mainstream hits. But I'm really glad I read it. There was great character development and you really get sucked into the story line. The movie was a HUGE disappointment after the book. It was easy reading so good for middle school or high school kids, but well written so adults can enjoy as well. If you enjoy action/suspense, or thriller type books you will enjoy this one even if you don't usually read &#34;sci-fi&#34; type themes.

B005LAIISA|1.0|All I can say is please let this series die before it loses every last ounce of its dignity.  The first one was great, the others sequels less so and now with the arrival of the four hundred and forty fourth one, this series has hit an all time low.  This is just a weak movie all around.  When you pretty much know what the entire plot of the film is going to be in the first five minutes of the movie, you know you're in for a long boring, cliche ridden, been there done that, nothing remotely original sequel.  Spoiler alert, Manny and his daughter are reunited in the end and they're both sorry for what they said before they became separated.  Gee didn't see that one coming from like 200 miles away.  The only think I liked about this movie was \\"Precious\\" and even that character was not enough to save this awful cash grab.  Just like Shrek-this series seriously needs to end before they can milk it to death entirely .  Blue Sky Studios has done some incredibly original films over the years (Horton Hears a Who & Rio for instance), why they keep wasting time churning out more awful Ice Age sequels when they're capable of so much better is beyond me.  Oh yeah, the whole cash grab thing....  Regardless, it's time to move on please-Manny, Sid, Scrat and Diego need to be permanently retired.  They've even made Sid a boring character and I thought that was impossible.  I own the other three ice age movies, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Even before I had seen it, I had seen it all before if you catch my \\"drift\\".
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Extremely well done historical view of war years and changes in social system.<br />Contrasts up stairs with down stairs in the house, but doesn't really view the<br />changes in industry, community life, and business which were also changing.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|Clees at his finest - he holds nothing back!  Have seen the shows repeatedly,, have yet to view the extras, which I will get to...one of these days....
B001BW02B8|5.0|Great album! Digital is the way to go; having it stored in the cloud and easily accessible is a plus.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Sometimes television gets it right and with spectacular results.  Homeland smart, and thrilling, with characters that sizzle with life on the small screen.  This is the kind of acting depth that movies just can't compete with as actors get hours of onscreen time and playback, to hone their characters to a knife's edge of perfection.  Created by the makers of 24, this is not just another 'let's go beat up our enemies' sort of thriller.<br /><br />Much of the action goes on in the characters heads putting this show in the same category as House.  You have to watch Homeland from the beginning, and after the first show, you're hooked.  Just when you think you have it figured out, the plot goes the opposite direction, and the viewer is forced out of the kind of lethargy that you get when thinking you know what's going to happen in your favorite show.  You WILL NOT know what's going to happen next in Homeland.<br /><br />The stars of the show do some of the finest acting I've ever seen.  I have winced at Claire Danes portrayal of Carrie Mathison, the CIA operative who's always just one pill away from someone putting her away for good.  The pilot starts off with Carrie bribing her way into an Iraqi prison to talk to a man who's going to be hung within the hour.  She promises him that she'll take care of his family if he gives up what he knows.  The condemned man whispers that an American POW has been turned in Carrie's ear just as she's being dragged away by the guards.  The tension is unbearable.<br /><br />With Carrie somehow back in the States, she hears that a man who's been imprisoned for 8 years has been rescued.  Nick Brody(Damian Lewis) is home now and a hero, and of course Carrie is sure that he's the POW her source told her about.<br /><br />So, that's basically the plot.  Carrie thinks Brody has turned against the U.S. and no one believes her.  Her boss and mentor, Sol(Mandy Patinkin) is amazing in his role.  He's high strung himself, but has all the discipline Carrie lacks to keep her under some sort of control.  The yin and yang of these two characters as they swirl around each other, is breathtaking.  Watching Sol reel his brilliant student back to earth is masterful.<br /><br />Carrie is one flawed woman, and it's her flaw that makes her so brilliant as she dances circles around her superiors and senses on some sort of animal level what Brody is all about.  Or is he?  Carrie battles to keep her sanity as her genius threatens to take her down.  She vacillates between being a control freak, and heartrendingly fragile.  It's a feast for the brain to watch this complicated character week after week.<br /><br />Brody's wife is that gorgeous actress from V, Morena Baccarin.  I find it more than ironic that she could pass for an Iraqi, and that she's married to Brody.  Did the writers do this on purpose to show that Brody night already be sympathetic to middle-easterners?  And Sol is married to an Indian woman, while his character is Jewish.  Again, we have the conflict of a man whose job it is to protect us from the violence of the Middle east while married to a woman who could be Middle eastern.<br /><br />Homeland is complex, exciting, and the kind of show where your brain never gets a chance to tune out.  Television at its finest.Carrie lacks to keep her under some sort of control.  The yin and yang of these two characters as they swirl around each other, is breathtaking.

B0015AARJI|3.0|It was nice to finally get a controller. But after about a year of use and little to no abuse, which is not normal for my controllers, the controller seems to malfunction electronically a bit. It'll start causing things to happen in games that would involve pressing certain buttons when I don't press anything. It's quite frustrating.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book ever!!!!!!!!<br />It was so amazing and touching that I couldn't put it down. I laughed and cried which made it amazing!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the book up very much until the last page. The ending was very disappointing. I expected something different.
B00008GKEG|5.0|A must watch for anyone who likes the Beatles.A must watch for anyone who has never experienced the Beatles. Buy it!
B008XG1X18|4.0|The app for my Kindle Fire is just one more place for me to loose myself on Pintrest. I couldn't be happier!
B0018QCXH8|2.0|This movie gets you sucked in, you cannot stop watching it. The ending is like a Coen Bros. movie. What just happened!
B00ACFL69C|4.0|This may be the ultimate grindhouse movie.  It elevates that genre into something all together new and creative.  Violent and some times gory (certainly not the kind of film I normally endorse)  I highly recommend this film to an adult thinking audience.  The sexual scenes are gritty and absurd.  As a woman, I found them disturbing.  To watch this film you have to step away from what you feel is moral and right and just observe how the characters interact . It is as if all the wacky crap in America got boiled down into a thick soup of insanity.  If for no other reason, see this movie to see Juno Temple as the waif like Dotty.  Somehow she manages to combine Tinkerbell, Luna Lovejoy, and Linda Blair all into one character. The remaining cast is outstanding including the pit bull, T bone.  And........the film has the best ending of the year.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|i would recommend this product to parents of young babies.<br /><br />bought this to replace a samsung baby monitor that i had for 9 months after my curious and active baby decided to break the old one.  the samsung one was actually a pretty good product, but with smartphones all around the house, i think the video unit for the baby monitor is rather obsolete.  i saw this product a while back, but since there isn't a need for it then, i bought two when i realised that the old one need to be replaced.<br /><br />this product is very good, and the connection is extremely simple to set up.  i order this from amazon, and it arrives in HK in the 3rd day, which i much quicker than for me to go to the shops to get it.  once delivered, my wife set this up with ease and inform me to view the baby together on the account she set up.<br /><br />the video is clear (though the refresh rate can be improved), and there are plenty of features to play with - e.g., the music function does actually provide music, not just noise pretending to be songs, and the good thing is that this can transmit video and sound via bluetooth, wifi, indoors, outdoors, etc.<br /><br />i have one in the bedroom and one in the lounge, and this pretty much covers all activity areas that the baby has, and i can give instructions to the maid at home via my phone, so, this is extremely handy if i see something not right.
B00005QATY|1.0|Worst purchase I made this year. I had a horrible time watching it and keeping up. Threw it away when I finally finished watching it.
B00005JNNZ|4.0|It Just came a little late as warned (christmas time) quality was good as described! I am a happy customer!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have to admit I thought this book started out kind of slow.  For some reason it didn't capture my attention until the half way point, but I guess I should put that statement into context before I continue.  If a book really captures my attention, I finish it in less than a day, maybe two at the most.  [[ASIN:B00AQ3K8IU Hopeless]] took me three days to complete due to what I considered it's \\"slow\\" start.<br />I'm not going to tell you the story line because there are so many other reviews that already do so.  The point I want to get across is that if you start this book and you find yourself even remotely interested in the story of Sky and Holden, then PLEASE do yourself a favor and FINISH THE BOOK!!  I promise you this is one story where you WON'T see the ending.  This is one story that will leave you completely breathless, yet totally satisfied.<br />Normally, as soon as I finish a book, I immediately begin reading another one.  Many times there's literally no less than thirty seconds from the time I turn the last page of one book, to the time I turn the first page of another.  I can honestly say that it has been hours, not seconds, and not even minutes, since I finished Colleen Hoover's \\"Hopeless\\".  YES, it was that good!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Super jeu. Je suis devenue accro ! Je le recommande à tout le monde. Très bien conçu il permet de construire une ville à son image.

B008KNUKVI|5.0|Saw this acappella group this past Christmas on You Tube and fell in love with them !!! Had to have their DVD!

B0073LQYA4|4.0|The child presented with this LEGO set was delighted and enjoyed it very much.  Most LEGO products are worth the creation stimulation effort.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was great.Very detailed I felt like I was there. Better than the movie. I couldn't wait for the book.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Engaging little movie that shows we face many of the same issues no matter what our age.  And it is never too late to find your true self and make a new beginning!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Bought this for the two knives that I have and it does a pretty good job. There are directions on how to use it on the back of the packaging and I advise you to read these if you don't know what you're doing. They are pretty straight forward.<br /><br />I would buy again.

B007M45PMU|4.0|A nice mix that reminds me of Of Monsters and Men + The Guggenheim Grotto.  Big Parade, Ho Hey, and Dead Sea are particularly good.
0307949508|4.0|Have read the books years ago and just bought them as a gift.  This is a great reading for amusement
B003V9OCIS|5.0|Great movie, well acted. I thought it was interesting and apparently based on true story. Some breath taking scenes in the movie.
