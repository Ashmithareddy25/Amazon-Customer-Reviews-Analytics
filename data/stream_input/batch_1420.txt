B007IXWL2C|4.0|I think the last book was much better in the entire series. Not so much repetition and the plot was engaging! I prefer this book more than the second and first one. Although I couldn't help notice the similarities with the whole shocking pregnancy between this book and book 4 of Twilight. But overall, E.L. James did fairly well with this book.<br /><br />The entire series was good, but not the best. Just good...
B0055SWM08|5.0|it is not bad but not challenging art all. graphic is a little blurry. I would not buy it but as free app it was not a bad play for a half an. hour.
0439023521|5.0|what a ride! Loved it. Have read it 3 times now, and have introduced it to many other people who have become fans just like me. Katniss is a great female character. It isn't a pretty story but it is one heck of a journey.
B005MJDJQQ|4.0|The author is an excellent writer and this one is also enjoyable.  The story keeps you wondering<br />and like a mystery should. I have read many of Mankell books and never been disappointed.
0375842209|5.0|ok so I just cried through the last half of the book. I can't even review this book. I loved it. That is enough. The characters felt real will stay with me forever. I can't believe I waited so long to read this.
0143038419|5.0|I prefer the movie, and my girlfriend prefers the book... Either way eat pray love is a fantastic story anyone can enjoy.
B005EM8O8O|3.0|Logarithms, quants and money rule this world. This story is about present day greed where \\"money\\" makes money (my \\" around the word money is my opinion). Here is a world that produces nothing to benefit mankind. All though written as fiction there is a great deal of truth in this book. Think Wall Street and think speed trading.<br />What a shame that great minds have fallen down the rabbit hole. Robert Harris is a favorite author but this is not his genre.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Who doesn't love TRON!?  They did such a good job on this movie, it's a thrill ride laced with Daft Punk.  A combination that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Didn't let me play any avid files just kept asking if I wanted to use gallery or not which wasn't working in the first place and why I went searching for this.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor is a well done production, the fighting scenes are great and the actors are top notch!  get it in blu ray to enjoy it to the fullist!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|It's a really fun game that is kind of similar to Mario but unique and makes you keep on playing!!!!
B005ERWYH6|5.0|Adele sounds great on the CD. Best of her hits. Enjoying the bonus track as well!  Worth every penny spent on this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so addicting! i wish energy wouldnt run out so quickly. other than that its great, can not stop playing lol
B00006I53S|4.0|Overall: 73% (3.63 / 5)<br />Don't compare this to an L lens, because its not. but it's price/picture quality are great and provided you dont mind dealing with a few small easily reconsiled issues with the build, this lens will quickly become your favorite and never leave your camera mount.<br /><br />Picture quality: 4 / 5<br />Images taken with this lens look fantastic. And that's all that really matters. The IS is fantastic and gains you a few stops. 3.5 is good for indoors (especially with IS) use a flash if zooming indoors.<br /><br />Ease of use: 3.5 / 5<br />I was tempted to give this a 3 star rating here,  but this will depend on shooting style I believe. People handholding using primarily autofocus will find the variable aperture makes more work for them. this lense has a macro focus range as well!<br /><br />However, how hard is it to compensate for a variable aperture? Not very, especially at the price point of this lens.<br /><br />If you find yourself manual focusing you'll love the full time manual ring with auto focus over-ride. A nice feature (especially if your camera has live view) the AF is very speedy with a USM Motor.  Focal range is very handy and great to work with. Even on a crop sensor (such as the rebel series) if works out to 44.8 - 216mm still a useful range.<br /><br />Build quality: 3 / 5<br />The main body is sturdy. switches feel durable. 2 major points of interest bring the score down. Lens creep and movement when the barrel is extended. It feels worse than it actually is, and provided you don't drop it all the time, it will last you years to come. To deal with lens creep. Extend the barrel before you start walking around (you'll need to zoom to frame your next shot anyway, so its really not a big deal)<br /><br />I really question canons engineering on this one. Rather than dealing with the lens creep by elimination, they seem to have designed the lens to hold itself when fully extended. (it doesn't creep when zoomed to 135). The result is a lens that when you examine it for the first time, feels like it wants to shoot either at 28 or at 135. If you buy this lens, it's going to feel like it was meant to skip 50mm all the way to 125mm. In practice however, It wasn't ever really a problem as when you're shooting, you have a hand on the barrel of the lens anyway.  The barrel felt loose at first to my tastes, but in practice it felt great in my hands.<br /><br />Value for Cost : 4 / 5<br />This lens puts out fantastic images. At its price range, its undeniably among the best lenses on the market. I was disappointed canon won't include lens hoods without the L designation. Compared to canons competitors (tamron / sigma) their warrantee sucks, but the resale value it nice!  I picked mine up for 299.99 refurbished (new is 375.00  as of this review) For 3 reasons.<br />1. Cost<br />2. Its tested before I get it, so I know it works.<br />3. I get a better warrantee with a refurbished item!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game brings the wild west back its a great game but when u chop down a tree it takes away atone of energy
B005K0HDGE|3.0|As a years long King fan this was a disappointment.  Good historical fiction, yet highly romanticized version of the 60's.<br />Imagine if a woman had tried the same trip.  Could not rent an apartment, buy a car, place a bet, etc.
0671027344|5.0|honestly the best book ive read. but in charlies words; 'but every book i read changes my favorite book because theyre all great' legit read this book i read it in 2 days and im 13 years old thats the fastest ive ever read a book...it had me glued!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is an awesome game! it is easy to learn and i get frustrated when it is hard. i was thinking about getting it until it was free and it is definately worth the money if you are planning to buy it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Mg. Mg gt gt I uyt utg ugh u ut g f hf uff tcuf u g utter it gt fctc j I ipg it he he he!
B00785P2QC|3.0|boring. something to do to make time go faster nothing special but It is okay I guess. you have to go through really boring things
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is just like Super Mario brothers! one of the most fun games to play! great graphics and fun and challenging levels.great and free!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its like an Irish version of Mario ... except that u can throw pinecones and u can go backwards . . I liked it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a&agrave; ababa a a a aa a a a. a a a a a a a a ak yep that does it girl
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Loved it. its a really good game personally anyone who love tycoon games this is the game for you so go out there and try it.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|and for good reason. This book doesn't digress with other characters, adds just enough Irish sounding names to make me feel like the author did some research, and most of all has me laughing out loud routinely.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i really love this game and instead of getting big coins you get big pots of gold.it is really cool and i hope they keep ot put and make it for nintendo ds
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy so much the app.  I have it on my phone and Kindle.  I use it for daily Bible readings as well as taking it to church.  What a blessing.
B006LNOOW0|5.0|Everything was fully intact, and was right on time. As far as the film itself goes, I love the Kung Fu Panda films.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The character development sets Stephen King's 11/22/63 apart from other time travel novels.  Using the \\"butterfly effect\\" and the romance aspect from \\"Time and Again\\", King allows those of us who remember where we were when Kennedy was shot to do what we've all wanted at some time...go back and change things.  The ending is so surprising you'll never want another \\"mulligan.\\"
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Great. Farmville number 10000000. If u like farmville this is good but may seem like a waste of time later.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was sort of entertaining...I guess.  It's in no way good or well written though.  The characters are Bella and Edward from Twilight knock offs (minus the vampire thing) and do we really need Edward and Bella knock offs?! I think one weak, pathetic female falling for a brooding, over protective stalker is enough. I feel like the author tried for sexy and failed miserably. The descriptive language is the same over and over again. From the reviews I read I expected this book to be hot...not the same description of some chick's orgasm repeatedly. And I want to scream every time she refers to her vagina as \\"my sex\\".  Most annoying phrase ever!!<br /><br />In conclusion..it's fine if you want an easy read and can get passed how poorly written it is.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|simple and easy to use. no crazy bells and whistles. just what needs to be paid and when. it nicely seperates the bills that are overdue and adds up the total money you owe.
B0055SWM08|5.0|music is absolutely beautiful its funny this game inspires a peaceful relaxing aura. its amazing and I recommend for everyone Bc there is no way anyone wont want this game :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|20 Word minimum?  This seems like a farmville clone to me but it works nicely on my Fire so I might stick with it for a bit.
0857680986|5.0|Andrew Loomis is the last word in figure drawing.  His book is all-inclusive for the figure or portrait artist.  My 1945 edition is one of my cherished possessions.  My artist friends who paint portraits or figures on a weekly basis acknowledge this book as an essential tool in our artistic endeavors.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This certainly satisfied my craving for a game comparable to my experience with Window's mahjong experience.  Flor free you just can't beat this game.  Well rendered tiles a jaunty tune in the background and and a intuitive interface.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a great game. Very easy to learn and a good time waster. It does not take very long to replenish energy. Three minutes per energy is not too bad considering that I usually play games that take five minutes per.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|this a long gripping read  he leaves with a big question and wants you to  buy the next book. If you remember the reading the last 1/3 of the book in just a list of whos connected to who.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching Downton Abbey. The actors are phenomenal and I hope that there is a third season. Hats off!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm on the Kindle Fire and this app works great. I can do more than one place at once and don't need to know the zip codes just to be able to look at a place. I love the Radar and how it gives a look at the world instead of the place ur at. the only Set Back is that the app is constantly running...
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a very relaxing game.  Right now my wife is yelling at my kid and she left the TV on too loud, but I'm OK because quell is helping me find peace in life.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is a simple but fun puzzler. The art style is very nice and it controls well. I enjoyed it overall
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is my new favorite game I cannot believe someone rated this game one star! This game is the best one in the world!
0307387178|5.0|As one of the few living people who has actually read Moby Dick unabridged from cover to cover without skipping a word, I know that a large portion of that novel, which so many of the rest of you label the greatest ever written, is a very dry treatise on marine mammals and whaling.  So one only shows one's ignorance of great literature when one criticizes the author of Into the Wild for including so much text devoted to extreme outdoor experiences unrelated to that of the story's protagonist, Chris \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" McCandless.  The book does a fine job of telling its story. So did the movie and yet they're entirely unalike.  So there.<br /><br />Anyone who tells you otherwise is either a fool whose breadth of knowledge of literature could be contained within a copy of Cliff Notes; or someone who holds a grudge against the protagonist, the author and/or any other young person, who like the former, had the cojones to attempt what they were too punk to ever try.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I wanted to know if it had zen garden before I buy it on my kindle so please tell me in your next comments:)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a very challenging game that really makes you use your brain.  I would definitely recommend these game to anyone who is looking for a very long and challenging game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a sweet love story with lots of heat. I enjoyed seeing the complexity and depth of Ana and Christian's relationship grow and evolve. Just started on the third book...can't wait to see where this goes. I'll be sad to see the story end.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a really cool game and if you have ever played old nintendo games you will quickly see where the msin ideas came from. that being said the developers have added enough new stuff to mske it fun not to mention it is a well done app that does not just steal data vis weird unneeded permissions on top of that its free!
B001RXB4FY|5.0|Volbeat was a new band to me as of 30 or so days ago. They are a great band!! The cd itself was in perfect conidition. I will definetly be purchasing in the future from Amazon.com!
0439023491|5.0|I read the first book just in time to see the movie in theaters, so naturally I have to read the second book.  I'll tell you what...the delivery was spot on and in excellent condition. IN FACT, the book arrived a day earlier than the expected date!  I am a happy camper, but I hope I never have to set up my camp in an  arena surrounded by blood thirsty tributes, tracker jackers, and genetically modified mutants using recombinant DNA formulations.  Still, I'm sure Amazon would deliver on time in those conditions.  5 STARS ! ! ! ! !
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game. lots of adds but the kids like most of the games I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love the music, graphics, feel, and concept of this game. I would like to see many more like it.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Back in the day when VH was THE rock band all my buddies were playing VH 1 and II relentlesly.  When Women & Children First came out they all said \\"Ah, it's not as good as the first two\\" but I was sucked in immediately.  For me this album demonstrated a much wider range of creativity from the entire band.  The lyrics were far removed from the shallow, mundane, obligatory \\"Let's party\\" message of most rock bands at this time.  Fast forward to 2012 - When I plug this in on my iPod the songs STILL hold up for me.  They really don't sound dated at all (like Phil Collins does!).  I still debate with friends about the quality of this CD in comparison to other VH discs.  Eddie's guitar licks, rhythm's and banter with Alex's drums and Michael Anthony's base just grip me.  This isn't just a hard rock anthem album, but an example of just how tight these guys were and what great musicians they'd become.  There's hard driving guitar riffs that drive chills down my spine, there's humor and there's seriousness in the stories told in this collection of songs.  The Women & Children First disc is one of my fave of all VH albums including the Hagar CD's.  I don't have an \\"either/or\\" mentality so I can like both Roth and Hagar led VH songs.  But if you're one of those who have to be on one side or the other, that's a sad place to be.  If you're on the Hagar side, you're missing out on a diversely great album here.  If you're on the Roth side, then you won't know what I'm talking about because to you there's only ever been David Lee Roth.  For those objective and open minded people who just like to hear good music, especially great rock & roll and you don't have this CD in your collection, GET IT!  You won't be dissapointed.  Another under appreciated VH disc is Fair Warning.  Check that one out also if you don't have it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i use this app all the time its quick to get to,fun,fast,and easy i love this!!!! and best of all its free
B007PTJOV0|5.0|really reminds me of mario. its cute and fun! i wish there was a 2 player option. it would be great to share the fun with someone else at the same time. i would def recommend this to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like playing solitare and this is another easy and fun way to do that. I especially like the touch feature so when you touch the card it goes where it can play. Most of the time it is the exact place I want it.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Its fun but really hard to play on the Kindle Fire. Its like Mario Bros. but with a Lepercan.... I'd probably like it better if the jump and move buttons were easyer to use.
B006ICOK00|5.0|This camera takes the work out of producing a time lapse video. You set the time interval, turn on the camera, and when you retrieve the video it is ready for viewing in time lapse.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is ok.but I have played better the controls in a few games are slow but other than that the game is great!!!!!!!!!!(:
1451648537|5.0|I am not a reader. I have probably read 2 or 3 books in my entire life, but this one kept my attention and I enjoyed learning more about Steve Jobs. Highly recommended whether or not you're a fan of Apple.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game it just keeps u coming back for more:) always looking tor more games like this just hates how u have to wait for energy
1451627289|5.0|It's been a while since I've written a review and in that time I got so bogged down with \\"literary fiction\\" I forgot what a good story was.  Enter Stephen King and 11/22/63.<br /><br />Is it a page-turner?  Yes.<br /><br />Is it the size of the Manhattan phone book?  Yes.<br /><br />Is it chock-full of all the stuff I usually try to stay away from - that is, murder, madness and mayhem?  Yes.  Yes.  And yes.  It also has a super compelling narrator, characters and settings detailed to the nth degree and a story that won't quit.  Leave it to King to write a twisted, turbulent and totally riveting tale about an event of which so much has already been written.<br /><br />I'm not here to beat down so-called \\"literary fiction\\".  I'm not even sure what the term really means.  All I'll say is this:  thank you Stephen King for reigniting my love of reading!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Sometimes fun sometimes not. I mean who's gonna get the money for a million dollar theater and seems like when I leave the game I loose money. I mean but also its very fun and addicting so therefore I say its okay.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I'm infinitely happy that Gotye is gaining massive popularity. I've liked Gotye's prior work, but this album is simply magnificent.<br /><br />Gotye brings intensity to music that has lighter tones without weighing it down. The retro inspiration is obvious, but not parodied. He pays great tribute while maintaining a unique interpretation. There is great balance in this album. I love every song.<br /><br />It is definitely one worth purchasing!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Too glitchy! The time it takes animals to produce randomly changes to hundreds of minutes. Precious energies just disappear.  too bad.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This isn't a book that I would typically pick up and read.  I read it because a co worker recommended it to me and I am always one to read something that is recommended.<br /><br />It took me a while to get into it...like 100 pages.  But once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  It is a touching story.
B0071MV540|4.0|Kind of predictable, but a fun watch. The characters were fun and the premise was cute. For the $0.99 I paid it was worth it.
0793573742|5.0|I have several Les Paul books but this one stands alone. Not for info necessarily (although there is enough contained) but, as expected, for the pictures. This is the book to have to get the classic, vintage Les Paul vibe and fever.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Bought this PS3 controller thinking I was getting a good deal. What I got was a PS3 controller that did not sync properly and had stiff joysticks. At first I did not noticed that it did not vibrate when it was supposed to, having used a non-dualshock for  such a long time, and I thought the fact the the controller was stiffer meant better quality. This was not the case. It turned out that the controller was a knock off. I contacted Amazon then the store I bought it from and no one did anything about it. Thanks Amazon!!! Be careful when buying PS3 controllers. There's a reason why Sony changed its packaging to a blue box instead of the clear plastic one.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is awesome love it. and it's so additing love it love it love it and love it the best
B002XTXG1G|5.0|Anyone who knows the strange history of England's most violent prisoner, Charles Bronson, knows that this movie is a wonderful adaptation of that story. Great use of music of the era and I especially love the scenes where he is on a stage in front of the audience. Tom Hardy, as always, does an amazing job of capturing the character.
0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle holds back nothing in this book. He tells it how it is. We ll have read books on SEAL training and BUD/S. What makes this book so different is you can see yourself sitting next to Chris as he takes out insurgents with his Rifle. Great detail in how he describes how to deal with different threats on the battlefield. Chris Kyle may get a little political at times but that's why I like Chris. He doesn't sugar coat anything in this book. Its a book about a very talented Navy SEAL who does what Sniper's do best, Kill the enemy.!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Even though I got it for free! This the most addicting game, it's like temple run but on the sky
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is the best game ever you should totality get this game I play it every day of my life
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting. i play it all the time, and seriously cant pull myself away from it
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This amp works great. Now I can adjust the volume to my earbuds. Very easy to control and just plugs into the wire from the TV.
0345803485|5.0|If you're a prude or a nun, than these books probably aren't for you! I was glad to read something with some spice in it. It's a love story that will not bore you and will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you can't handle a little erotica, stick to Twilight ;)
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|pleaasseee fix the glitches! it says all animals, crops, and houses can be collected in like 79 hours! this game is crammed with glitches which is very disappointing because i love this game its exactly like frontierville!
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|WORKS MARVELOUS. MADE MY PRINTER PRINT FASTER AND BETTER. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ADD THE MEMORY AS IT WILL IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRINTER.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Very fun and slightly addicting. Worth the play!!! Graphics are nice and smooth and its easy to learn and play... Enjoy!!!!
0446547603|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I liked Alex and Katie very much.  The author developed the characters in the book nicely.  The storyline kept my interest.  *Spoiler Alert*  Had a difficult time putting the book down.  Kept waiting for Kevin to find Katie.  Although I figured out who Jo was, I thought it was a great twist to the story.  The letter Alex gives to Katie, had me crying.  Wanted to read more about Alex, Katie and the children - but I know they all had a happy ending!  Wonderful book with a wonderful ending!
B00632HWOG|2.0|Latest update is no longer ad-free. All previous versions were ad-free, making it a nice app. What happened? Hate this one!
0765365278|5.0|A great work by Sanderson. A definite read. This was on of his first works I read, and I am hooked.
B003QCCS36|5.0|A gift. If you ever get a chance to see them live do not pass it up. Soul squeezing melodies that make you feel alive. Beautiful!
B002R5QPRI|5.0|This movie is one of the best.  Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner both make/made outstanding performers and I love the way Kevin made his roll in this movie seem to be so authentic.  Great film and one that is well worth the money spent to purchase it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I loved playing this game for about a week. Great graphics and fun game play that had the nostalgia of of the old version with some cool updates. Sounds great right? It is until the game starts glitching and the timers on my crops, houses, businesses, and animals sporadically reset themselves to ridiculously long periods of time. Some reset to 40 hrs and others to over 200 hrs!! It made it impossible to progress in the game as some of my missions were dependent on the collection of various items from these timers. This game would have a 5 star rating if not for these issues. I'm disappointed that I can't play it anymore.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Mario could use a few lessions. and controlles need a upgrade but Mario has nothing like this calaber it is awesome. ignore all the 1 star reveiws.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't know why me, an old geezer, loves YA fiction...but I do.  I like to dive in and pretend I'm 15.<br /><br />Kudos to the author here for not chickening out with the ending (which I will not spoil).  Kudos to the author for her first person perspective of someone going through emotional hell.  I went through something dramatic in my life and the author's writing was painful to go through but it was SPOT ON!<br /><br />This book was the best of the series.  The other 3 books were fine but this book was the best of the three.  Yes, you might not like Katniss not being superhuman but a 16 year old girl...but live with it.<br /><br />Loved this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the first short story, Wool, and was interest enough in the characters to purchase the Onmibus Edition.  I particuarly like the development of those characters, difficult sometimes in short story format.  I recommend this book even to those that aren't particularly fond of short stories as the Onmibus reads like a single novel. The ending pulled the story together well which I thought to be a bonus, and will read other work by this author.
B00756GKBA|5.0|When everybody thought Madonna has nothing to say, she appears at the halftime Super Bowl and blow our minds, then she comes with album and she beats herself. Anger, love, desperation, hope, inspiration, everything in this record join with the best rhythms. Is a must in your music library. Excellent piece of art
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is a challenge but if needed you can use hints. you earn hints by completing a level in as minimal moves as possible. I haven't seen anything where you use real money and another thing, when you use hints on a level, after you finish it, it still gives you hint-coins. it is a really cool game I recomend it.(:
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I actually like these kinds of games usually but the wait for energy makes me not want to play. It's annoying to see your money and food but not be able to collect it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|spoiler alerts****<br />-after the fall of the capitol- where was gale?? did he just give up on katniss so easily<br />-we didnt get to read about the fall of the capitol or the trial of katniss<br />-how could katniss not be there for her trial<br />-i cant come to terms with the fact that Panem thinks katniss is a crazy looney and coin (in a sense) escaped.<br />- and what was the point in katniss leading her team into the capitol..they accomplished nothing nothing nothing- they saved no one, they killed no one, or captured no one...all it resulted in was finnick n boggs deaths<br /><br />i hoped that katniss ang gale wud have had a more important role in the fall of the capitol
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|Another reviewer noted a scene that was cut due to content, I wouldn't have remembered it if they hadn't told me:( But other than that the picture looks as good as it possibly can, only a few times does it show it's age. Overall this is an interesting video, with lots of great performances, some videos and humor thrown in. If you like Michael Jackson this is a must have, if you are a fan of 80s music/videos you would definitely be pleased as well.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Its an ok game, the only bad thing is that you can't get a winning game unless your online. But other than that its good.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I was so excited to get this app. the first two days I had it, worked great no problems. it had some sort of update and glitched. I'm now waiting 37 HOURS on half my stuff to get money. It's quite frustrating.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is really fun and the graphics are great<br />if u are a parent that needs to distract ur kids this game is the way to go<br />but the items that cost real money should cost less
B005SFR7YE|5.0|What can I say about Phantom that hasn't already been said?  This is absolutely one of the greatest shows ever produced and is one that I'll never tire of watching.  I simply become overwhelmed at not only the story and the music itself, but also by the talented people who make up what I consider to be a musical classic.  I've seen this musical live about three times, and have also watched the anniversary show on PBS.  Along with Les Mis, Miss Saigon, and several others, Phantom of the Opera just places me in another world.  Everyone should make music and the arts a part of their lives, as it's food for the soul.  God bless the artists who create such magic for our enjoyment!  Thanks to Amazon.com for making this available.
B007ONQ42O|5.0|I first started listening to them on Slacker, then saw them live, and had to buy their first album.  It was very good.  This one is even better.  What a voice Lzzy has, and the band is very tight.  If you like hard rockin' fronted by a woman with a strong voice, you will love this album.  Don't just DL \\"Love Bites\\", buy the whole thing.  You won't regret it.  I was going to listen to a couple of cuts when I DLed it, but had to listen the whole way through.

0316056863|3.0|Loved the first half of this book - so funny, but the second half, not so much. I admire Tina's sense of humor, being a big fan of 30 Rock, but was disappointed in this book. Stuck with it thru the end which I normally wouldn't do, having high hopes it was just a lull in the middle of the book.  It wasn't and I felt let down by the end.
B006CNR0BG|4.0|I only checked Gentle Giant out for the first time a couple of years ago. I have to be honest at first I wasn't too impressed. Mostly due to the vocals. Well I gave the albums more time and really started to enjoy them. Then this and in' terveiw came out in 4.1 so I wanted to check them out. First off once again I have turned .UK for my product .ca not getting stock once again. I received mine in about six working days. The DVD's are NTSC and region free.<br />Back to the music. Complicated music like this really benefits from surround sound. It gives you a much better separation (think mono to stereo) between instruments. So it has given me a fresh look at this album. Much like when I heard King Crimson's Lizards for the first time in 5.1. When you can hear everything going on I feel I get a better understanding of the music. the music here is great! If you like Progressive Rock (who cares if critics don't like it) this is a great record. A little short but really interesting. The sound quality on the DVD is flawless. Nice warm bass sound. Great use of all the speakers (well except for the center channel remember this 4.1). 10 out of 10 on sound quality. If you don't have surround you Stll might want this. It also has a 96/24 transfer of the original stereo mix. Which at such a higher sampling rate gives you a much better sounding version of the record.<br />This package is a great addition to anyone's surround sound collection. Hopefully there will be more but I doubt it. These were released because a four channel mix was made for Quad Stereo back in the '70 hence cheaper to put out now. Too bad Octopus would sound amazing!

B005LZYL3G|4.0|I saw Pearl Jam and Soundgarden open for Neil Young in 92 or 93 and then they slowly drifted off my radar. Then this last summer I got to see them both again. I saw pearl Jam at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto during the Toronto Film Festival where they premiered this film. The film is really good for someone like me just getting back into the band there was a lot I did not know or had forgotten so it was really interesting to watch. They had great interveiws with the band and Chris Cornelle from Soundgarden. It starts of with some great video of Mother Love bone which I had never scene before. It also had some Temple Of The Dog live video. Lots of great clips of Pearl Jam live (since they have so much live film and video I really hope they make a set like kiss did where you get multiple shows in one package) and great interveiw clips from throughout their carreer. However I do feel Pearl Jam must of had final say on the film because certain things get mentioned in passing (like drug problems) and very little of the internal struggles are talked about or expanded on.<br />I don't know how great this film would be for die hards. If you know the Band's history there won't be much here. Although the Grammy segment is classic. My only major complaint is the lack of bonus materiel. If you bought this from their web site you got four hours of bonus material. I am getting tired of the practice where you have to by things from certain sites to get bonus material. I know you are saying \\"just go to their website\\". Well in this case they are sold out and sometime it's not the Band's web site you have to go to. With Yes's Union DVD/CD you had to go to the web site of the company making the package. I also feel it punishes people who get into the group later on. I also know in my case it has discouraged me from getting into a group that I can't get all the product I want from. I did eventually buy their CD's but this happened when I got back into Iron Maiden because I could no longer buy their cd's with the bonus b-sides disc's. It has also stopped me from picking up their other albums because of the CD reissues they have started and you get bonus stuff when ordered from their site.<br />So over all! Solid Doc.longer buy their cd's with the bonus b-sides disc's.

B001TAJGO6|4.0|The movie is atypical of Carrey and certainly of Winslett.  The breakup of the protagonists cause both to eventually desire to lose their minds - or at least their memories - of their relationship by undergoing experimental memory erasure therapy.  Two elements occur to bring the viewer into some level of connectedness with the protagonists - first, the pain of breaking up is always best forgotten, but also that even the worst relationship, the worst memories generally had some redeeming quality in it.  To wish something never happened doesn't mean it didn't, and there is truly no way to erase our past, or fully forget about it.<br /><br />The actors stretch themselves from their traditional roles, and do a pretty fine job of it.  The comedy is dark, but not so dark as to be uncomfortable.  More telling, however, is that the story line and the theme apply to every viewer.  We all have things we wish we could erase, and perhaps the lesson that we cannot, and should not, need to be remembered.

B007ARJF6G|1.0|Before, you could count on Madonna to at least be fun, if nothing else. This is not fun, its seems rushed, and thrown together just cause she needed another album out.

B00756GKBA|5.0|This is by far Madonna's best studio album since 1998's \\"Ray Of Light\\". The moment the thumping beats of \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" start, you want to get up, dance, and never stop. I have had a few friends say they use the album to work out. I have another friend who plays the album 24/7. Myself, I play the album on my laptop everyday while I work from home. Anyone who thinks Madonna is past her prime is going to get a wide awakening to discover The Queen Of Pop is back and here to stay!

B007CM9AMI|5.0|I think Bruce Springsteen has risen to his former glory in the last decade, from The Rising to Wrecking Ball. This is another great album, for devoted Bruce fans and for newbies. Wrecking Ball, American Land, We Take Care of our Own, Rocky Ground, and especially Land of Hope and Dreams are standouts. Don't pass up this latest Springsteen masterpiece.
0307592731|5.0|WILD by Cheryl Strayed is the story of a woman's healing journey, and yet the memoir is so artfully written as to be completely devoid of self-indulgence. The introduction and the story arc are so cinematic that I have no doubt that this book will be made into a successful movie.<br /><br />More than anything I was aware of the conscious choices that the writer made in telling the story. What to tell. What not to tell. What to wait to tell. The tale is brilliantly told in poetic detail with palpable restraint.<br /><br />I feel that this story of a woman learning to mother herself and heal the hole in her heart after the loss of her mother and a period of self-destructiveness is deserving of a place in the cannon of literature. We need more books about the heroine's journey. Especially those where the heroine does not die. We need about ten thousand of those to make up for some lost time.<br /><br />Nature is a major player in WILD. Nature is big and alive and teeming with possibility, danger, and despair in this book. Along the journey, the storyteller encounters nature over and over. She encounters actual nature: a fox, a bull, a bear, frogs, and many others. She has a unforgettably tragic encounter with a horse. She also encounters her own nature, quite squarely.<br /><br />Strayed had to become empty before she could become full. She took us with her on this journey. When she ached, we ached. When she exulted, we exulted. You almost get the sense, as a reader, that this archetypal journey could happen again or is always happening and is, perhaps, a necessary pattern for living.<br /><br />To become empty and then to become full is a natural part of the growing and healing journey. Strayed was starved but now she's found. She blinded herself, but ultimately gave herself back the eyes to see.<br /><br />Thank you, Cheryl Strayed for the gift of a terrible story beautifully told with a modern fairy tale ending, where a woman comes to her senses and therefore to her own rescue.own rescue.
B006IW8DX0|5.0|I am not a fan of dance, ballet or modern, but Pina thrilled me from beginning to end.  I've seen it twice now, and the second time was like I had never seen it before and I was, again, entranced.  I look forward to seeing it again...and again....  It's an amazing piece of work by Wim Wenders and Pina Bausch's extraordinary ensemble, guaranteeing that Pina's legend will live on.  Clearly, many of the dancers had been with Pina a long time, and the degree of trust between the dancers speaks to less ego and more collaboration -- something all-too-rare in many art forms.
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|How about taking it to the Boss's last six CD's, and mercifully starting over. The Rising would be quickly falling. Tom Joad would be sent sailing to the next county preferably not mine.  Devils & Dust pulverized to Just Dust. Magic: Now you see it, now you don't.  Working on a Dream to Working on If only it Were a Dream. And finally planting Wrecking Ball, itself, six feet under the Meadowlands next to Hoffa...

B00009Y3L4|5.0|Cabaret was a required movie to study when I was taking Film Studies in College.  The Godfather was nominated for ten Oscars, and Cabaret took eight of them away from The Godfather.<br /><br />Cabaret takes you through an artistic journey into 1930's Germany and you see a beautiful culture transform into the evil Nazi Realm.  Joel Grey plats the Emcee and he is as the Spirit Of Satan through the movie; his glances and images show up throughout the movie as the morality and culture decay into pure evil.<br /><br />It is close to what is happening in America today.  Scary stuff.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows of all time, such a shame it was canceled after only 1 season. However, it being so good and having such a rabid fan base, a movie was created to satisfy the big gaping hole left in the souls of nerds/general populace: Serenity. So if you enjoyed this series, which Im sure you will if you have not watched it, check out the movie as well. :-)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|So I got this game thinking it would be pretty lame but giving it a try. And honestly, I'm glad I did because the game itself is reeeaaallllyyy fun. It's similar to Mario Brothers &amp; is great for passing time. It has good graphics &amp; just the right amount of difficulty. It works great on my Kindle Fire.
0749942169|5.0|I was blown away by Lupton's \\"Afterwards\\".  It's incredibly inventive and though it's on the romance side of the mystery genre it wasn't cloying.  Likewise the fantasy or paranormal elements feel believable.  The story is told in almost omniscient, first person, present tense by a mother who is a fulltime homemaker.  Grace has a son, Adam who's just turned eight and a beautiful seventeen year old daughter, Jenny.  On Adam's school sports day Jenny is working as the onsite nurse and Grace is there to watch the games.  It's a beautiful, warm July day with kids running everywhere having fun.  Then tragedy strikes, the school catches on fire and Grace runs in to the inferno to rescue Jenny.  She's almost too late.  Jenny is horribly burned and Grace suffers a serious head injury.  They both wind up in the hospital.<br /><br />So far we're in the mundane world but things change when Grace and Jenny find they can leave their damaged bodies and talk to one another freely.  They watch, unseen except by one another, as their loved ones mourn, worry, and try to solve the mystery of who purposely set the school fire and why.  I know some people are put off by first person accounts as well as those told in the present tense but Lupton writes so beautifully and with such insight it's not a distraction.....in fact it seemed to me the perfect way to tell this moving story.<br /><br />This review is based on an e-galley provided by the publisher.<br /><br />4.5/5 stars
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are fabulous. They are violent, but it is all part of the story. I believe that these books ae relatable to people of any age, gender, or race. Definitely a series I will read again, and again.
B00753MBHA|5.0|What a tremendous incarnation of the band. These last 2 discs have been great. This one sort of crept up on me in that the last one was so insanely good i spun this one expecting so much, and at the end i was like, ok then.  Not bad.  But, upon not that many repeated listens, i cant get it out of my head, and now Im playing it pretty much constantly.<br /><br />  Sad to think I still have buddies who wont even give this a shot cause they are appalled at an Accept without UDO these days, but let them miss the boat if they choose. High marks from me.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Awesome! Just received these today and went out for a 4 mile run with these and iphone. Could not feel weight. Sound was very good. Very comfortable. Earlier I tried using Sennheiser Sports Earbud Headphones - one side earphone stopped after just few months. The Sony headphones don't look as fancy and stylish as Sennheiser but I have a feeling I will love them more. All along the run the headphones never wobbled and never gave me any uncomfortable/annoying feeling. Felt just right! Now I hope they last long enough!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really liked this game and was really into it. I played for several days and reached level 18. Out of nowhere it froze and force closed. When I reopened it the timer said that my animals would be ready to collect in 435 minutes a task that normally takes 10! All of the actions had similar times. I'm deleting and redownloading. hope it fixes the problem!

B003V1WXKU|5.0|Being a physics enthusiast and, hopefully, a soon-to-be physics student, I want to know more about the great minds that shaped this field into what it is today. Of course, this book was a no-brainer for me so I bought it as soon as I had the chance.<br /><br />First of all, this is a book for everyone, not just for those that love physics. As my title states, Feynman was quite a simple man, without the philosophycal-babble that sometimes comes with a genius. He puts everything so simple, so gracefully, that you wonder how it comes you couldn't figure it out by yourself (even if the subject is physics/chemistry/biology-related).<br /><br />Secondly, this book focuses more on his life and not that much on physics (which it doesn't lack, however). He relates more about lockpicking or playing the bongos than quantum electrodynamics, but, trust me, you will not want to put this book down after you start reading about all his adventures. Furthermore, the book has 5 parts, each part having several chapters, starting from his very childhood and ending in his later years.<br /><br />Feynman is definitely an inspirational model for me. He was human, as Oppenheimer said, funny and... I wanted to say smart, but that is an understatement. He was connected with the world around him, and he understood every aspect of this connection. He exceled not only in physics, but also in chemistry, biology and computer sciences. And yet, as you will observe by reading this book, he was as simple as a human can be.

B000000OPQ|3.0|Vision Quest is a cult classic from 1985 that may well be best known for the number one song \\"Crazy For You\\" by Madonna that she also performed in the film.  Madonna was a rising star when the film was released and the film garnered attention as it was her first appearance in a film.  She sings the aforementioned \\"Crazy For You\\" and \\"Gambler\\" in a bar scene.  Journey also scored a top ten hit with \\"Only The Young\\" which was originally recorded for their Frontiers album, but not released until the soundtrack.  It has become one of their most enduring classics.  Don Henley contributes one of the rarest songs in his catalog.  It's a punchy track with backing vocals by Belinda Carlisle & Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go's. The rest of the album is made of previously released tracks like \\"Hot Blooded\\" by Foreigner, \\"Change\\" by John Waite and \\"Lunatic Fringe\\" by Red Rider.

B006OFN0SE|4.0|I have to say that I enjoyed this film overall. J. Edgar Hoover is a difficult subject to approach as a film, he was a man liked by almost no one, and feared and loathed by many, which makes him difficult to use as a sympathetic character, and indeed most of the time he's not. J. Edgar Hoover was also a man very much caught up in his own myth, and the film does a good job of showing that. Leonardo DiCaprio does a very good job of bringing the character to life, though I suspect the real J. Edgar was an altogether stiffer and more opaque person. The director (wisely, probably) chose not to delve to deeply into Hoover's alleged homosexuality, choosing to portray him as a celibate closeted gay man, sharing a close friendship with another obviously gay man, but never \\"consummating\\" it. Given how little is really known of Hoover's private life, this was probably the prudent choice for this part of the film. The film does a very good job of capturing the style and look of the time accurately, the clothes, cars, interiors, lighting, it's all very authentic looking. We are removed enough from the Hoover era at this point where for most people he's a relatively enigmatic character at this point, far removed from the \\"G-man\\" hero he wanted to be remembered as, and also far removed from the fearsome trampler of rights and prolific spy and wiretapper who was so feared and reviled while he was in power. The scene with an overly youthful looking Nixon drew a few chuckles from me, some considered it over the top, but it looks like vintage Nixon to me. If you've read the transcripts of his tapes, his lines in the film ring true. The only thing that I found perplexing was the strange loyalty shown by those closest to him towards such an imperious and often mercurial boss, but perhaps that's just my take on it.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|As for any sort of review I'll just say that it was done in a very well thought and careful direction.<br /><br />The books as many of you know contained ALOT of violence and blood (As was the premise really) but the movie went out of it's way to cut away just a split second before each death was shown, leaving you with an understanding of EXACTLY how each character died yet saving us the issue of dealing with the gore. I thought that by doing this that it was a great way to keep their YA attributes within the movie.<br /><br />As with any movie released from a book, time constraints were inevitable but this movie does a decent job of pacing and keeps much of the important aspects of the books intact and takes little away from their importance even within the time frame.<br /><br />Minor gripes come in the form of the Mockingjay Pendant, I won't give it away but it was a part of the movie that was drastically changed from how it was in the book. However, with thinking of the time constraints and the already hefty task of character development adding a full back story and additional characters may have been too much for the length of the movie.<br /><br />Finally, Overall the acting. I will say that everyone in this movie did an absolutely wonderful job with their respective characters and other then small physical attributes nit picking I had seen on the web everyone did everything they could to make this movie as close to the books as possible.<br /><br />All in all it was a great movie in my eyes and whether you have read the books or not, you will be moved by these characters and their story.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|I loved the books, loved the original movie version and was dying to see this US movie version and was totally disappointed to find out that the DVD cover is a faked product and then absolutely disgusted to find that Amazon would allow the sale of a PIRATE copy DVD!!!!<br />As this DVD is only a COPY of an original the quality is lacking which greatly lowers viewing pleasure to ZERO!!<br />If I had of wanted an ILLEGAL PIRATED COPY of the movie I would of done it myself instead of being RIPPED OFF IN PAYING FOR IT!!!

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|This is an entertaining family movie, I watch it often, 3D brings out the finer points of the movie.

I bought it so I can watch it over and over.

B006JSXYPA|3.0|This movie suffers the same imperfections as the review I did on The Three Musketeers. The movie is a fun movie to watch, watching it in 3D makes it even better. The quality of the movie is suspect, it has several flaws, there are scenes that fade out, and a couple black drop outs, it only last a couple seconds but takes away from the overall viewing of the movie itself, this is why I didn't give the 5 stars I think it deserves. Whatever company put this movie to disc need to check their master copy for flaws.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love it!  Totally ADDICTED!  Would not change any thing.  Love how you can rearrange your town.  Love it.  Love it.  Love it.  Love it.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I finished this in less than 2 days--I will say that I work full-time and I have 9mo-old who just started crawling last week. Any chance I get to sit (which is not a lot), I read this. I bawled in the cafeteria today while reading this, and now I'm done, and I don't want to read another book for a while. I want this feeling of a good book remain for a little longer, almost as if I'm afraid the next book won't even compare. I absolutely loved this book--do yourself a favor and read it! You won't regret it :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i love the game and it is a very very good awsome game and all of it is good game
B002BWP49C|5.0|My wife loved the movie so much, she went out and bought the book so she didn't have to wait for the second movie!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a fun puzzle that requires a little thinking.  the graphics are good and having hints is a great option.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I'm only twelve but I'm under a lot of stress but when I play this it all goes away and I love this game
B007PTJOV0|5.0|omg!!!!! Ive only been playingbthis games for about a day now and I already love!!!! I strongly recommend this to people who liked playing Mario games.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my second Howey book, after \\"half way home\\", and this is even more amazing. It's the kind of book that introduces you in a new kind of state of mind in a new dystopic world. It is someway between \\"1984\\" and \\"Dune\\". The idea behind is quite original and the story highly immersive. This series and its author is likely to become more and more popular. I won't be surprised if a movie will ever be taken from this. Moreover, it seems like wool6 is going to be released in days and I can't wait!! I only hope the author will be able to manage develop the plot keeping it at a the same high level for the new issues.<br /><br />The book is really well written, no typos and you can never say what will happen next. This is even a very good book for anybody who aims to learn more of english by international readers, like me.<br /><br />Kudos to the author. Great job!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy the zen music playing while I am solving the going puzzles. I recommend it to anyone who likes solving.
0345803485|5.0|I am amazed at how good this book is. I could not put it down. The charaters, storyline, and sensuality has me wanting more, and I don't want the book to end.  I am now obsessed with all of the music.  I can't honestly wait to see the movies!
0345803485|4.0|This is a great book.  I couldn't put it down.  It was my fastest read ever.  I had to cover my eyes on many pages, but I must say it kept me wondering what was to come next.  Let's just say I had to buy the next ASAP.
B000NDEXOI|4.0|I'll start my review by stating that I usually hate greatest hits compilations. They rarely get the songs right, and almost never cover everything that fans have come to expect from the band.<br /><br />As far as compilations goes, \\"40 Seasons - The Best Of Skid Row\\" is actually a pretty solid disc overall. I can't really complain about the songs that were included, even though some exclusions were head scratching, and other inclusions were moreso. My biggest gripe with this album is, why are all the songs from \\"Subhuman Race\\" either demos or remixed? As long as I have owned this album; I have never figured that out. The song listing otherwise is extremely thorough though. All the hits are present, sans \\"Wasted Time,\\" which is missed, but not essential.<br /><br />If you like Skid Row, I suggest you just buy all three of their records. You could maybe skip \\"Subhuman Race,\\" but the rest are essential releases.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|THE HELP is one of the best movies released since Gone with the Wind. Few movies do justice to the book its based on- this one does. The setting is historically correct and the performances are exceptional. A classic.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Had a great time with the game. Lasts for awhile, the music is nice, and the graphics are a nice touch. The puzzles are brilliant!
B006TLFPKO|5.0|This is a very good movie, i can watch over and over again and again. they need to make another one
0307352145|4.0|Did you know that about one-third of the people you know are actually introverts?  You might not for two reasons: A) the American culture prizes extroverts and B) introverts know this and are very good at faking it.  Not only do Americans look favorably on extroverts, but they tend to see introverted personalities as a weakness and something that needs to be fixed.  People like Tony Robbins have made fortunes on teaching people how to ignore their own personality for the sake of appeasing everyone around them.<br /><br />Enter Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.  Susan Cain has done extensive research and ardently argued for the value of introverts.  Quiet charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal and explores its far-reaching effects.  Susan boldly questions the dominant values of the American business culture, and school system for that matter, where forced collaboration can actually inhibit innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked, simply because introverts defer to the ones making the most noise.  Most importantly, she offers exceptional advice on how to navigate extrovert-introvert relationships, how to empower an introverted child, and when it makes sense to be a \\"pretend extrovert.\\"<br /><br />I chose this book because I am an introvert.  And I have definitely spent many minutes of my life wondering why I can't be extroverted, even after reading all the books that are supposed to help me in that area.  I've seen my introverted personality as a handicap that I must either overcome or get used to the disadvantages.  In true introverted fashion, I've resigned myself to the latter.<br /><br />This book changes all that.  Yes, our culture prefers extroverts, but that does not mean we can't contribute to the world.  We might have to be more aggressive than we are comfortable with, but we can learn how to compensate for that by allowing ourselves to recharge in isolation.  Introvert does not mean anti-social either.  It just means that we socialize differently, and it's okay that I've never had the desire to go to clubs or big parties or the zoo on a busy Saturday.<br /><br />This book not only encourages introverts, but it offers valuable insight for extroverts who are interested in strengthening their relationships with the introverts in their life.  Everyone should read this book in the name of strengthening community.<br /><br />This book was sent to me by WaterBrook Press in exchange for an honest review, as a part of their Blogging for Books program.
1466401885|5.0|I feel like the title doesn't lie. Anyone who goes INTO this novel expecting something that's going to be healing or soothing should come back at another time. And there will be that time- as humans, we all have that urge sometimes to be self destructive and do what we know we shouldn't.<br /><br />That's what this novel is about, Trav and Abby are two imperfect people. They both have baggage-- Abby with her dysfunctional parents and Travis with his inability to control his temper. However, somehow, the story makes it work. I think because within the bubble of Trav and Pidge, they are able to normalize each other. With her, he is just a boy desperate to hang onto the girl he loves. With him, she is just a girl, clinging onto the strand of security and safety that she so desperately needs.<br /><br />But the romantics will eat this right up. I certainly did. Trav's gigantic love for Abby that he pretty much is UNABLE to contain as we see with his jealous fits and rages. Abby's inability to stay away from Travis because he, is the haven that she needs.<br /><br />As this novel takes place in a college setting, I'm not sure it's really fitting for the typical YA readers. I'd say this novel is definitely 16 and over. Because I feel like anyone too young reading this might read things the wrong way, and really think that the obsessive, jealous, at times violent, relationship that Trav and Abby have are ideal.<br /><br />It's not.<br /><br />What I love about this book is that what Travis and Abby have is not picture perfect. It isn't the white picket fence, but for them, it's what they need from each other and what gives them the rainbow and unicorns of love that we all look for. And as a reader, their love breaks me, their dysfunctionality makes me sympathize, because we all know that none of our own relationships are perfect. But it doesn't mean that it isn't love.<br /><br />One gripe- this this novel takes place in college but i feel like some of the classes they aretaking are super elementary. I didn't even know they teach algebra in college. I thought you were supposed to learn that by the time you graduate high school.<br /><br />TBH I'd like to give this book a 4, but I'll give it a 5 just because I really feel like the book IS what it advertised. This romance is one that's a hot mess, but it works for them.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very relaxing while at the same time very stimulating.  The puzzles are not overly complex and it's a simple concept, but it's put together nicely and is very enjoyable. Works well on Kindle Fire.
B007ONQ42O|5.0|I heard the song Love Bites on my local rock station. I was instantly glued to the radio. When I got to school I decided to look them up. What I found was nothing short of awesome! So buying this album was a no brainer.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|yeah its similar to Mario but still original in its own sense. one of the few games with touch screen controls that play surprisingly well
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been using this Bible app simply for the reading plans. There are many plans to choose from. If you get behind just tell it to catch you up.
B001DHXT2A|1.0|BEWARE - though this is advertised a a \\"THREE-DISC SPECIAL EDITION\\" the digital copy activation code expired 10/31/2009. NOT WORTH THE PRICE without the digital copy. Disappointed with Amazon for not policing this more closely.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun for all ages. very addicting. cross between original oregon trail and farmville. my two younger children love it. fun for whole family
0321701763|5.0|This manual is the best way to learn photoshop which is complicated.  This manual is easy to follow.  It is like using a cookbook.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think this game is fun. as a kid growing up playing super Mario brothers which is addictive I was glad to find this game on my kindle.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Ian Anderson, the good house-master of Jethro Tull has done it again. Yes, Tull fans get ready for another wonderful musical adventure that is Thick As A Brick 2. I might be biased being a life-long Tull fan but I received my copy a week ago and I am genuinely blown away by this fantastic collection of tunes. Ian skillfully blends his own solo style with Tull themes and several musical reminders of the original masterpiece we've loved since 1972. Banker Bets, Banker Wins and Old School Song are alone worthy of your attention and the rest of this CD will leave you pushing the replay button again and again. Ian has truly \\"nailed\\" it again. The only thing for me is to try and be patient for October when he comes to the Beacon Theater to perform it live. It is not a Jethro Tull album perse, apparently scheduling conflicts prevented Martin from appearing but I assure you this young gent (Florian Ophale) is excellent and a kick ass guitar player who infuses some great licks and masterful playing that will make you nod, turn up the volume and smile widely. If you have never heard Ian's past solo works like Rupi's Dance, S.L.O.B., Divinities or even Walk into Light it is no matter, this piece stands on it's own, to be praised and appreciated by fans of Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson, I guarantee it. What's my guarantee worth you might ask. I am an old rocker who knows little but knows Jethro Tull for well over 40 years we've been graced with music from this \\"professor\\" and he has never let us down yet. You know it, I know it so get a copy of TAAB 2 today and enjoy. My only question is \\"What the Tull is Fray Bentos Pie?\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I got this book  because it was on the top sellers list. I am not really a romance novel reader but thought I would give it a try since it was so highly rated.<br /><br />I loved the book & couldn't put it down. Christian & Ana are interesting characters and the story moves along & keeps you wanting to read more.<br /><br />If you start out reading this book thinking it will be a literary piece of art you'll be disappointed. It can be repetitive in places. However, if you take the book for what it is - you will be thoroughly entertained!
B005K17RU0|5.0|love the graphics.  the functionality.....removed all my other weather apps. would definitely recommend this app to anyone who asks hope you enjoy it too
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read the book before you see the movie!<br />I loved this book and would recommend it for any age.<br />I was originally told \\"it's a story about a bunch of kids that fight each other to the death in the woods,\\" but it is so much more than that. I felt for these characters.<br />I read the whole series in under 7 days... I couldn't stop... Even on lunch-breaks, while getting a haircut, etc.<br />My mom and boyfriend read the books shortly after me and both enjoyed it more than they expected.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I've been using this app for over a year now (before it was on Amazon app store)  and just starting seeing issues with it.  Recently,  I noticed that when I'm downloading a video in the background,  my phone will start acting up a lot.  It will either crash or just freeze up.  Also, the download will sometimes say &quot;retry downloading&quot; every 5 seconds and will pretty much take forever.  Im using a Droid Bionic (2.3) which is a dual-core phone and it freezes but yet on my old Droid X,  it never froze before.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A fun relaxing game.  Simple concept game with some fun twists.  Well worth $1 with good replayability.  Runs smooth on Galaxy Tab.  Quick levels means you can play whenever you would like to for as long as you would like to.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|short but good.<br />minimum replay value outweighed by charms.<br />really enjoyed the setting and puzzles. would have liked fast travel though.

Get ready to spend time around the water cooler talking about it with your co-workers.<br /><br />No wonder Hollywood is dying to bring Harry Hole to the big screen.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun to play when your bored. keeps you entertained, and there os so many different types of games you can play, sk no need to download so many games just this one :)
158270208X|3.0|Honestly you don't NEED this book/journal, but it is nice to have. Basically it is a blank journal with an 8-page intro by Rhonda Byrne with some tips you can implement for the gratitude process (like saying \\"Thank you\\" 20 times before writing in the journal) and then 180-ish pages to write in. That makes this journal last 90 days or 3 months if you write in it daily and use 1 of each page per day.<br /><br />If you buy this and USE it, then you can't go wrong. Using and sticking with the technique is what counts, whether you write things you are thankful for on a napkin, a white board or in this journal. What you don't want is a book that you will end up jotting down your to-do list, or storing tax receipts in, so if having a specific book to write in will help you stay focused and centered then this is probably a good start.<br /><br />The idea is that the left-hand pages are for \\"Gratitude Now\\" entries and the right-hand pages are for \\"Gratitude Intentions\\", so every day you list what you are grateful for what you have on the left side, and what you want on the right side.<br /><br />The page design is such that at the top of the page are the words \\"Gratitude Now\\" or \\"Gratitude Intentions\\" depending on what page you are on, and on one of the side borders a word for \\"Thank you\\" is in another language (Danke, Tanu, etc.). At the bottom of alternating pages is a gratitude item, not really a quote, from Rhonda Byrne to keep you focused or inspire you for the day (\\"Thank you for the great news that is coming to me today.\\").<br /><br />There are 3 pages from quotes from writers and teachers at the very end of the book.<br /><br />I would have preferred to have a quote from a teacher on each page, but as this is a gratitude journal, I guess the provided gratitude affirmation/saying is appropriate.<br /><br />The book is small, which I like somewhat as it is very portable, and the magnetic closure is convenient - and pretty strong! It feels good in the hand and looks like an ancient leather book with embossed words for \\"Thank you\\" in different languages on the cover.<br /><br />The pages are lined, which with my handwriting is a must! The lines stop well within 1/4-3/8 of the page edge so you don't have to cram or squeeze your writing all the way to the crease or the page edge.<br /><br />The paper quality seems very good and is of a good thickness.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I will use it, have had it for a day and have been carrying it around - deciding if I will write in it or give it away as a gift to a true devotee.<br /><br />All in all, I would probably be happier with a blank journal like many other reviewers, or one with more quotes. Other than looking pretty cool, any journal could serve the same purpose of writing your Gratitude items, but **possibly** having this journal could provide some format and discipline for someone who needs it or who wants something visibly connected with \\"The Secret.\\"<br /><br />Remember, Einstein, Churchill and Edison did NOT have this book and look how well they did :)e an ancient leather book with embossed words for \\"Thank you\\" in different languages on the cover.<br /><br />The pages are lined, which with my handwriting is a must!

B007PTJOV0|3.0|I love it. very close to mario. the graphics are great and the controls work great. I think this is great for all ages.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|Finding hidden objects is sometimes fun, but not in The Lost City.  I was constantly lost!  The map was so confusing, and there was such a specific way you had to do things, that it took all the fun out of the game.  I had read other reviews that talked about having a hard time finding their way around, and I disregarded them, so it's my own fault.  Don't disregard this review!
B006671NPM|4.0|I enjoyed the 3d blu ray version of Part 2 of the Deathly Hallows.  It looked sharp on 65 inch Panasonic Plasma 3d tv, and the 3d scenes weren't overdone.  The parts that come out at you are well done, and the edges aren't blurred, which is sometimes the case when you attend 3d movies at the theater on non-Imax screens.  I had heard the part 1 Deathly Hallows 3d Blu ray wasn't very good, so I didn't buy it.  But I do own the complete box set collection on Blu-Ray, and I am very happy with that, even though the final film is not in 3d (I had to buy it separately).  I have listened to all of the audio books in the series, and enjoy all of them immensely.  It's a very multi-dimensional series for adults and children alike.  It's very multi-dimensional.  The films, to a certain extent, have lost some of that magic, but they are a nice companion piece to the books themselves.  I would listen to an audio book finish it, and then re-watch the blu-ray film version so I could compare.  I recommend people interested in the series try this.
B004LWZW88|4.0|Great service, came quicker than expected. I was disappointed by the story but it was worth what I paid and I did receive what I paid for. Thanks for the prompt service and I would buy from you again if the opportunity arises.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|There is a fair share of blood in this movie, but the blood is similar to the blood in the Monte Python and the Holy Grail movie when someone's arm gets chopped off and just a ridiculous amount of blood comes out that makes it funny.<br /><br />This movie was similar to The A-Team, in that I didn't go into it expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Basically you have Tucker and Dale that are looking forward to fixing up a cabin they bought and a bunch of college kids looking forward to a week of camping in the woods.  Due to some bad first impressions and some accidents, people start dying and each group thinks the other group is trying to kill them!  It's one of the funnier movies I've seen in a long time.  At no point do you ever really get \\"scared\\", like in a true horror movie.  I wouldn't let young kids watch it, but people who normally don't like horror movies would enjoy this movie.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Thanks for the prompt quick service. The movie was the best and is excellent especially on blu-ray.<br />I will buy from you again if the opportunity arises.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Awesome game! Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnn! Super fun for my kids and I. Energy refilled a little slow....but not bad. Tasks are crucial to leveling up.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I am a big Lady Thatcher fan so I was anticipating the release of this movie on DVD. I rented & saw it last night with my wife & children. Wow what a movie, the portrayl of Lady Thatcher was remarkably done, the dialogue was superb and the conservative message was right on. very appropriate for today, but putting political opinions aside it is a must watch; for the life principles of Lady Thatcher are gems & if utilized in ones own life will I believe be verfy helpful. I am going to buy my own DVD today of this movie.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Fun and mindless game! Easy to play but easy to spend too much time playing though... but I still love it!
1439153663|5.0|This book is extremely powerful.  The characters were vibrant and dynamic.  The strength and love that is demonstrated and portrayed is evident and inspiring.  I have been motivated to learn more on this time period and thank Kathleen Grissom for writing in a way to encourage me to do so.  Certainly there are passages that are difficult to read and painful to imagine.  There are equally passages that provoke strength of character and demonstrate unconditional love and devotion that remind me how precious and fragile life is.  I was a different person after reading this book and will refer to it in the future when I need reminded of these strong, rich and vital elements in life...that we all need frequently in our life long journey.  I highly recommend this book.
B005PMNBNG|4.0|Great album from m83. I think I listened to this non-stop for a few weeks after I downloaded it! Favorite song is MIDNIGHT CITY, so if you only want to buy one song today, go with that one, you won't be disappointed!

B0055SWM08|5.0|So simple yet so hard.  Sometimes it looks so easy but to do it in the minimum number of moves, that is another story.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I read Next Stop while on the Long Island Rail Road train to and from work. It enlivened my commute although I will admit I had to show the conductor my ticket through veils of tears on numerous occasions. The story is funny, sad, uplifting, inspiring, humbling, and disheartening, sometimes all in one page. Weaving the particulars of one family into a broader tapestry of autism, worker's rights, education and disability awareness, Next Stop merges the personal and the political, the individual and the community. Unflinchingly candid, Glen Finland writes like the best friend every mother wishes they had. The portrait of her family, and particularly of her adult son with autism, will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever struggled with what it means to be human - which is to say, I recommend it to everyone!
B000089RV6|4.0|A ROCK CLASSIC!

B000AJIF4E|1.0|Like many other reviewers my earpads kept falling off, and every time i got them back on they would stretch out a bit more, thus fall off again more quickly.<br /><br />What bothered me much more is that in less than 2 years the cord gave out. A section of the cable will only pass the complete signal if i stretch or wind it, and this is after only 22 months. This set never left my living room and I took pretty good care of them.<br /><br />Prior to this set I used Sennheiser HD-280s which cost less. I was nothing short of abusive to them most weekdays for 8 years and they still work (although the bass is slightly blown out). I know that sets the bar a little high, but I expected at least 4 years out of these Sonys. I didn't get it.<br /><br />I regret buying these and won't buy headphones from Sony ever again, seems like the \\"planned obsolescence\\" Sony is often accused of. Other companies like Grado, Audio-Technica and Grado seem to care more about making quality products, and I should have trusted their reputation instead of buying these headphones.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|when Mario is like your only favorite game you looks for games similar. I loved it. lots of fun. and who doesn't want to be a lep instead of a plumber. more levels and more colors please. its fun fun fun fun
B000069HJI|5.0|Generally unloved by music critics. Supertramp has been accused of being too populistic and just wanting to create hits (not sure what's wrong with that) But i enjoy the compositions on this one. It's raining again, is probably my least favorite one. Somehow this could be a precursor to Hodgson's solo work, but shorter more compact versions.

1594203334|5.0|I am a first-time parent preparing for the arrival of our son in mid-June.  I have often found myself at odds with what all the \\"popular\\" websites, books, experts, and even close friends recommend as being the \\"right\\" way to parent. Reading the various parenting websites and books regarding how I need to handle my pregnancy, birth, and the care of my infant it is quite clear that I should to expect our lives to revolve solely around my son and his every whim.  Therefore, I have spent the last 6 and half months agonizing that I am going to be a terrible parent because I find that even though I am excited to meet our little boy and be a mother, I would still enjoy time to myself and time with my husband where we are still inherently ourselves and not just parents.<br /><br />Enter Druckerman and the French.  I came across this gem while browsing on my Kindle and spent the entire evening regaling my husband with, \\"WAIT!  Just listen to THIS!\\" Suddenly, I was not crazy and my own mother's voice was not the only voice of reason- I had an entire COUNTRY chock full of parents who believed some of the same things! Her easy to read narrative combines personal experience with solid facts, figures, and expert anecdotes.  She does not champion the French as being the ultimate parent figures; she merely highlights the differences she sees as a foreigner and her observations as to why these differences occur. She does not agree with everything the French do and is quick to admit which practices made her uncomfortable and the adjustments she and her husband made to fit their lifestyle and values. This unbiased view of how parenthood can be approached is refreshing and is not singular to the French.  It echoed my own upbringing and my parents' heritage is a delightful combination of Polish/Lithuanian and English/Scotch-Irish.  French, we are not.<br /><br />In selecting this book, I was never led to believe this is a \\"how-to\\" manual on how to raise a child, but I did find sound advice and resources to go to if I wanted to find out more.  Druckerman is able to laugh at herself and her own parenting adventures.  This is by no means a condemnation of all American parents and should not be taken as such. She kept an open mind and offers her account for others who would like to do the same.  An excellent read, an intriguing insight, and cleverly written book that ought to spark an intelligent debate regarding our values of late and what we expect and believe our children are capable of doing.
0307888908|4.0|This is a review for the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />According to the authors, Hoffman and Casnocha, \\"the career escalator is jammed at every level today.\\"  Viewing today's career marketplace as a new career landscape, Hoffman and Casnocha wrote this book to give the individual a new professional development roadmap.  Today's roadmap is dependent on the action of the individual worker and not the organization.<br /><br />Hoffman and Casnocha make the case that today's worker needs to think and act like an entrepreneur.  They describe career development today as being akin to being an entrepreneur running a start-up enterprise.  According to Hoffman and Casnocha, future success as an employee will depend upon the employee understanding entrepreneurial strategies.<br /><br />I found the book to have much to offer.  Thanks to the employee - entrepreneur parallels drawn, this book offers much to both the career employee and the start-up entrepreneur.  Both groups will benefit greatly by reading this book.<br /><br />The book was a quick, easy read and for the most part engaging.  I found it particularly interesting to read the behind the scenes stories about technology related start-ups the authors either participated in or provided financing for.  These stories added to the value of the book.<br /><br />So much is changing -<br />* The nature of work<br />* The workplace<br />* The employer - employee contract<br />* Competition<br />* The market<br />* The conditions we live in<br /><br />The constancy of change requires today's career employee to think and act differently.  This book will help you do just that.<br /><br />So whether you are just starting out in the workforce, or you are mid-career, this book will help you to see today's big employment picture and to develop an appropriate set of guidelines for building out your career roadmap.<br /><br />Today and tomorrow are all about evolution and adaptation.  This requires the employee's playbook to evolve and adapt as well.  This book will serve as a great guide for the new playbook.

B002PEP4SC|4.0|As a long time fan of the show, I was eager for any new Castle material, not to mention how the book would work with tying into the show.  While the writing is decent, it would fail to win any awards, I fear; and certainly not of the caliber I would expect of best selling author Richard Castle, as described on the show.  None the less, it does rise above the ranks of mere fan fiction, as is a breezy read with some of trademark wit of the show.  Well worth it if you're a fan, worth a look if you're not.

B00756GKBA|5.0|Haters are gonna hate! And haters have ALWAYS hated, for that matter. But you know what? Madonna reigns supreme over the dance floor! An impeccable record filled with euphoric insight on life and hate, recorded over pulsating, shimmering, throbbing beats. You either hate Madonna or have yet to clean your ears if you dislike this album. Pop perfection at its finest!
B000NMW6J8|2.0|Average movie at best but that's not what's really wrong with this movie.  What's wrong is the whole premise that terrorism thrives because our government is so inept and screwed up. Bridge's character is screwed up because the government screwed up his life and the same goes with Robbins' character, although they're supposedly on opposite ends of the spectrum on what is right or wrong.  Terrorism succeeeds in this movie because everyone associated with government and media, including FBI, is inept and screwed up.  So, what is the message we're suppose to take away from this movie - that the terrorism will succeed and should be allowed to succeed because our government is so screwed up?  If you buy into such pathetic cynicism, you'll fully enjoy this movie.
B00563K3DA|4.0|This book is about more than living your dreams - its about living your life in the best possible way.  Its an easy read with heaps of wisdom.  A great book for those starting out on personal journeys.

0345803485|5.0|I read all three books obsessively in less than a week on the Kindle app for my computer. I enjoyed watching their complicated, sometimes twisted relationship unfold. There was a great mix of situations and emotions: everything from dark and disturbing to light-hearted and playful. There were plenty of hot and steamy encounters.<br /><br />I will definitely re-read this series.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awesome! !! just like Mario bros  ;) its getting harder and harder but I'm getting much better!!! u need to get this game :D I LOVE IT NEW FAV GAME!
B0055SWM08|5.0|In the spirit of Cut the Rope and Where's my Water, here is a nice twist on a good time wasting strategy game. Might look easy at first, but still plenty of challenges.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I kept reading beyond the first one out of morbid curiosity, wondering if there was some large secret or bombshell that was going to be dropped.  It was more of the same lip biting, blushing, inner goddess B.S. that I found in the first book....and it was more of the same phrases and terms.  Dear lord, if anyone ever says to me, \\"laters, baby\\" I might just have to punch them in the face.<br /><br />This book was simply an extension of the first..it takes place immediately after the first book ends.  As the series went on (I have now read all three) it becomes increasingly implausible and annoying.  The more I read the more I found myself screaming.  I don't know who I want to scream at more--the author or the editor of these books.  \\"Holy Crap!\\" \\"Jeez\\" lip biting, blushing, the demands to eat something got old long before the first book even ended...and they continue into the third book.<br /><br />At the end of book two, I still don't know why these two like each other aside from a mutual sexual attraction.  There is no depth to the characters that give the reader any insight to their personalities, other than Grey is a total dick with a lot of money, and she dropped her drawers to a guy that likes to dominate.<br /><br />Are my reviews of these three books repetitive?  Good..because so are the books.
1401216676|5.0|This is a classic.  If you are a Batman fan, then you have most likely already read it.  If you are just discovering Batman, then go ahead and buy this.  Lots of other graphic novels in the DC universe give nods and inside jokes to this all the time.  It also features the iconic presentation of the Joker in his Bermuda shorts.
1612130607|1.0|There's probably nothing I could write in a one star review that hasn't already been said by other one star reviewers of this atrocious book.  The repetitive phrases make me want to punch the author and her editor-the lack of depth of the characters, the shallowness of it all.  Ana is NOT a heroine, she is not a strong person.  If anything, she's completely shallow for giving in to him constantly and melting over how 'hot' he is.  Is this 9th grade all over again?  Come on.  And again, the implausible plot lines and repetitiveness had me skimming through this book just to be done with it.<br /><br />I am truly surprised at the hype of this series..there must be a LOT of lonely housewives out there to shoot these up to the bestseller list.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is fun! almost super Mario bros! its fun fast and amusing ! talk about fun! best free app ive ever downloaded
B007PTJOV0|5.0|My six year old loves this app.  It reminds me of the original Mario brothers.  I would reccomend this to others.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the first game I like on my kendle fire. I like Sim games and time management games. I will try more ga.es from gameloft
B0055SWM08|5.0|Have played about 30 levels, like it a lot. I enjoy the calm music, can turn off if you don't. Endless, penalty-free do-overs if you want to solve perfectly. Using (reward for perfect levels) coin to \\"buy\\" hint takes you step-by-step to complete puzzle, not just give solution. Good tutorial to explain by doing, not just reading about. No annoying ads after every level. Visually pleasing...I got it as FAOTD, but I would pay for it...developers did a really nice job :)<br />Very much recommend for people who enjoy not just solving, but finding the one perfect solution without timers or other pressure...and TRY to play just one level, lol, ...worse than potato chips, but not fattening<br />Forgot to mention: playing on Kindle Fire
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good thing to pass the time with but has 2 many adds.  if u update it will delete ur progress
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very nice relaxing puzzle game with challenging levels. Worth every cent. Nice graphics and soothing music. Works smoothly on my kindle fire.

B007FZVWFA|4.0|I'm very surprised about all of the negative reviews for this movie.  Going in, I knew this was not going to be an Oscar-worthy film.  It's escapist entertainment.  Obviously it's not believeable.  Duh.  My entire family saw this at the theater and we all thoroughly enjoyed it.  There's humor, tension and lots of action.  It held our attention the entire time and we did not feel our money had been wasted.  I plan to rent it again on Amazon.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|Not my favorite, but I like simple stupid games. I'm sure there are others that love it.... Only three stars, because it isn't what I was looking for...

0345803485|1.0|Since gettin my Kindle, I have downloaded so many books that I would not normally have tried. Many of them free and many of them suprisingly good. And (my bad) I rarely find the time to write reviews even when I have enjoyed them.  But this book was so flat out horrible, that I felt a review was necessary.  And no, I was not at all offended by the graphic sex.  It's just simply a badly written book.  Juvenile, flat love story with erotica thrown in. Even the sexual scenes were silly and trite! Don't waste your time.  I truly can't remember the last time I read something this boring and insipid.  For the life of me I can not figure out who would think this was a book worth reading...let alone a good book worth recommending.
B005HEI61Y|4.0|The rest of the episode was decent but fairly unremarkable. But the last scene was touching. Just to think about how that would be... iPad in hand... That made it worth the wait. Interesting and different premise, too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app. I use it really quick just to get an idea of the weather real fast. I like the satellite too lets me keep track of the ugly storms we have been getting  lately.
0761169253|4.0|This is a solidly four-star book, better than average, but a little too lightweight to make it all the way to five stars. That being said, it's worth buying, if only for the many great quotes Kleon pulls together (even if some are a little shaky, such as the advice that you do professionally whatever you do when you're procrastinating - most people can't monetize socializing on Facebook). Buy it, read it in a couple of hours, and then return to it to get the things you missed in that first, fast read.
0062124293|4.0|I don't know how to break it to you, but if you have two X chromosomes, you are eventually going to become a woman. When you cross that threshold is a matter of conjecture I suppose, we all have that friend that wants to be a perpetual `girl', but we all grow up sooner or later.<br /><br />So, think of this as less of a manual and more of a hilarious re-telling of the pitfalls that can trip you up faster than the ubiquitous pair of Manolos that most of us won't have and truth be told, don't want or need. And about those heels, I'm pretty sure that originally they were designed by men to keep women from being able to run away. Or they simply hate us. Of course, Ms. Moran has her own theories about shoes, fashion, misogyny, and the big bad word- feminism. How did we let that word become an expletive? Maybe it was men telling us it was bad? Hmm? I'm no expert, but if you are of the female persuasion, maybe you ought to think about what it means, and embrace it as opposed to letting other people make decisions for you.<br /><br />Anyhoo- I enjoyed this book immensely. I may not always agree with Moran, but I've got a few years on her. Having said that, I wish I had been as smart as she is at her age. I admit I did have to google a few of the slang terms from across the pond. Yeesh, how pompous does that sound? But no worries, you can usually fill in the blanks.<br /><br />Can't wait for a follow up in ten years. I certainly hope she hasn't decided to have her face ironed out and her lips ducked up. I have faith! But then again, brunettes don't age as quickly as us blondes... but we don't have to endure as much waxing. Yeah, I'm with you Caitlin, let's all get hairy again and be happy.

1579126235|5.0|Shame on me, but I only read it when I had to during my LIT327 class.<br />The story is thrilling!<br />The shipping was fast, and the book's condition was mint.<br />Thank you.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I've been debating on getting this Beatles Mono Box set for a couple of years now.  One major draw back was the price when this set first came out, another was that I owned all the stereo CD's.  Was it worth shelling out the money to buy the mono version?<br /><br />I'm a second generation Beatles fan, so I grew up on the mono versions of their albums.  While I liked the stereo ones, I didn't like the back and forth sound from one ear bud to another on certain songs.  Yes, I was able to pick up more sounds on the stereo CD's, but I still wasn't thrilled with them.<br /><br />One day I was surfing on Amazon for something else, and the mono set come up in my recommendations.  I also noticed the price had dropped quite a bit from when the set first came out.  I put it on my wish list, and still waited, debating on whether or not to purchase it.  After waiting a few more months, I decided to go for it. After all, this should be the 'sound' I was used to listening to.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />They sound just like when I listened to the vinyl as a kid, and they have these cute little \\"mini album\\" covers complete with sleeves. They don't have the extra booklets the stereo ones had, but I didn't really look at them anyway.  Also the mini documentaries on the stereo ones were a bear to deal with when I only wanted to listen to the songs on my computer.  They would always load up without any options, and I would have to wait to be able to get out of it and go to the music.<br /><br />The CD's are also easier to get out than the stereo ones.  I never did like how the stereo albums were packaged.<br /><br />Yes, the Beatles Mono Box Set was so worth buying!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|well its a fun game time consuming but it doesnt have rediculase time lapses before u can do stuff so four stars.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Meryl Streep stars in this biopic of Margaret Thatcher as the elderly lady, suffering from dementia, remembers key moments of her past.  We see young Margaret in her first political campaign, as she meets her beloved husband (later played by Jim Broadbent), and her eleven years as Prime Minister with its struggles and triumphs; but mostly, we see her deteriorating health and increasing frailty.<br /><br />I was absolutely stunned by Streep's impersonation of Thatcher; aided by incredibly believable make-up, she looks and sounds just like her and gives a thrilling performance.  It is an example of the finest acting and I'm glad she was rewarded with an Oscar, but I wish the role had been played by a British actress instead.  Jim Broadbent, as Denis Thatcher, plays his usual, jovial character and, while very likable, reminded me of silly Horace Slughorn from `Harry Potter.'<br /><br />The script was underwhelming in scenes depicting Thatcher's public life, but it was excellent in the very moving scenes of her current life as a delicate, rather pathetic, old lady.  All in all, I enjoyed it but think it could have been better.

I still have the original vinyl I got as a teenager in the 70's.  Amazing Astounding Never gets old.  Simply one of the greatest albums ever recorded.  Bowie/Ronson dynamic is unbelievable.

B000JIHP88|4.0|We just put batteries in this mobile a few days ago for my 7 week old since he's starting to pay more attention to things around him.  He was immediately captivated by the animals spinning around.  The rainforest sounds are also very soothing, and I joked about using it for myself once he has outgrown it!  I don't use it to put him to sleep, but just to keep him entertained while I get quick things done. So far so good!<br />I already wish it didn't take batteries ( 3 D's) since I'm sure it will get tons of use. I haven't quite figured out how to do the different timed settings, but I know it turns off on its own and that's what really counts.
B007EMU4DU|5.0|Such a great show, so sad that it's ending!  I guess there's only so many diseases they can come up with though.  Loved this episode.

B002GZQYMK|4.0|I don't really like writing 'music reviews' as tastes just plain differ.  Plus in this particular case, I know nothing about the band, and my age demographic (mid-40s male, I do rip all my CDs to a USB drive for use in my car, and to a media server for the home, but do not own nor want to own an iSlave module that puts me in permanent donation status to the iTunes collective) might also be a huge discriminating factor.  So take all the following with that in mind.<br /><br />I bought this on a whim because I liked the song \\"Uprising\\" that was used in some TV commercials and was on the radio a while.  I really have never heard of or sought out Muse before.  So I went into it with lowish expectation, but lo and behold did find other songs on the album I actually liked as much or more, so the experiment was a success. (And yes, I'm thinking about picking up more of their albums).<br /><br />Not knowing anything else about the group but this album, I'd call it kind of \\"rock-operatic\\".  The lead singer's range isn't that great (sounds a little flat at times) but has good power.  The mix is good with vocals standing out from but not overpowering the music itself.  There's a lot of variety here from percussion to heavy bass lines, organs, violins, even some soft piano-ballady kind of notes.  Interesting bridges and tempo changes during songs.  Theres one almost blindingly in-your-face Queen homage in a song that actually made me laugh out loud on the first listen, and still cracks me up occasionally.<br /><br />Overall there's nothing I'd call groundbreakingly brilliant here, but neither is there anything I'd call tediously banal.  (OK, some of the lyrics are a little hackneyed, but this is entertainment, not necessarily \\"high art\\".)<br /><br />Makes for a great listen on the commute, or over headphones when the office gets noisy.  And like I said I bought it for one song but 'discovered' a few others to like.  In this day and age of instant gratification single-song downloads and Pandora radio...that alone says I got my money's worth, in my opinion.oads and Pandora radio...that alone says I got my money's worth, in my opinion.

About 3/4  left to read I really had to row hard to get through it.......boring.  Maybe for kids its ok.  Don't recall any profanity.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I first picked this book in paperback and put back because it is huge! plus the fonts were so tiny that it hurt to read it. But because of all the reviews it has I decided to give it another try...with my kindle.<br /><br />I don't regret it! Yes, the book is long but it is worth reading. I don't understand why people leave reviews here for the 4th book as well. Is not fair to say \\"i loved all first 3 books but...\\" and give it one star because of that. If you didn't like the last book don't review it here. THIS IS JUST FOR THE FIRST BOOK!<br /><br />God! people are so hard to please. Why compare this book to Harry Potter? They are not the same!<br /><br />Anyway, do read it, the book is wonderful.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|The sophomore major-label release from Halestorm has been highly-anticipated by fans for the last 3 years.  I honestly didn't know what to expect.<br /><br />This album is different than the Halestorm debut, in a lot of ways.  But if you're also a fan of pre-major-label Halestorm, you won't be surprised at what has changed.<br /><br />The tracks are laid out, to me, like a live show would be.  Hitting hard in the beginning, slowing down for a mellow section, and then bringing the tempo back up to leave the fans wanting more.  I see several people have commented on the slow section in the middle, and I very strongly guess they were trying to capture the energy of their live shows--which definitely do not disappoint.<br /><br />Regarding the tracks--I love what I'm hearing here!  Great, hooky choruses, melodic chants that are easy to sing along and wrap up in, and great slow stuff, too.  One of my favorite Halestorm songs predates their \\"debut\\" album...but it's called \\"Rose in December.\\"  It's simple--piano, cello, and Lzzy's powerhouse voice.  Some of these newer slow songs remind me of the older ones in a lot of ways.  On this CD, you don't find another \\"Familiar Taste of Poison,\\" but you find a less-fantasical, slightly stripped-down, but undeniably REAL mix of emotions in this grown-up ballad section.  I think they're wonderful.<br /><br />I will also say, I think the mastering and maybe the recording as well were done quite a bit differently than the first album.  The Halestorm debut featured what I felt was a much slicker, more polished sound...which was great.  Easy to listen to and crank up--but it wasn't true Halestorm.  It felt like the record company was trying to make them more \\"commercial\\" than they really were or needed to be--especially in light of their earlier recordings.  Halestorm has been around as a band since the members were literally children (PRETEEN children) and they've done a lot of experimenting with their sound over the years.  I think hard-core Halestorm fans will feel like the true Halestorm is better represented on this album than the previous one.  That said, I love both CDs (as well as the earlier work) and they will always have a place in my music collection.rd-core Halestorm fans will feel like the true Halestorm is better represented on this album than the previous one.

0439023521|5.0|I purchased this book after watching the movie and have loved all the extra details in the book.  The book reads really fast and I would recommend reading it even though I'm not an avid reader myself.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this case for my daughter for her birthday.  And she absolutely loved it.  So I bought one for myself.  They are very well made and make the e-reader so compact and safe.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|Ok I'm gonna keep this short if you like Sci-Fi Films and or Superhero films then you will like this movie.  It's a nice twist with teens getting superpowers in the present. It gives you a \\"what would you do\\" type feel if you suddenly got superpowers.  Would you use it for good or evil, will you get addicted to the power and feel everyone beneath you or would you try to help people and make the world better.  I have no complaints about the movie it was great my only complaint is i can't wait for the DVD to come out and the sequel so many questions that wasn't really answered.  I mean yea we know how they got there powers but where did that crystal rock \\"or whatever it is\\" come from.  Anyways it's a great flick and i think you should check it out especially if  you like Sci-Fi/Superhero movies.  For people that's worried about them using the \\"found footage\\" to present the movie don't worry it works out great for the movie since these days you have alot of people who record everything in there life if it's just a video blog or just for fun.  Trust me i usually don't like movies like this with the camera shaking around movies like cloverfield or quarantine but it worked out really well.  I hope you find my review helpful this is actually my first time writing one on here but i liked the movie so much i just wanted to give my 2cents without spoiling anything.
B0055SWM08|5.0|what an enjoyable game!! Makes your mind think and exercises your brain . Easy to stop and start at any time plus you can go back and do them again to se if you can better your score.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|this is fantastic: very country music and very good country songs (picture to burn, should've said no and our song are amazing). People can't understand that this is her best album. Not fearless or speak now: they're good but this is so much better. When she makes (really) country songs, she is awesome. But what she makes songs like \\"Innocent\\" she isn't.

B005IF5H2S|4.0|With the exception of two tracks, this album is the best yet by Lady Antebellum.  The harmonies are right on with a good mix of tempos.  Buy it if you are a fan of contemporary country.  You will not be disappointed.

1439192812|5.0|I bought this book for my son on his birthday. He is 8, and asks a lot of tough questions. Most books targeted at his reading level can't satisfy his curiosity. Its easy to read, but of course some of it requires a broader base of knowledge to put the information in context. I knew it would be a little beyond him, but he will grow into it and always have it at his fingertips. Right now he loves the illustrations and is able to skim a few things out of the text.<br />This book should be on every family's bookshelf. Also, it should replace the gideon bible in every nightstand of every hotel room! That's my utopia...

B007PTJOV0|5.0|This a pretty fun game akin to Super Mario Bros. on NES. I don't totally get why the art style is generic leprechaun, but I guess it's not awful. The jumping is a little floaty...but it actually works well with the touch controls. Music is forgettable. Overall, this is a great bargain for free--but would have been worth 99 cents if the art style had been intriguing enough for me to pay for an unknown quantity.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I loved this book. Yes, it's not perfect, no book is but it got me out of a horrible book funk and for that I'm eternally grateful to this author. YA books don't have to suck!

0385732554|1.0|This book immediately captivates you and puts you inside of a world unlike what we know.  It was a real page turner at first.  But, there were some things that I feel should have been better explained to make the story feel more real.  For example, that author didn't explain HOW the people were unable to see color or HOW all hills were removed.  About 3/4 of the way done, I realized that the end of the book was rapidly approaching and wondered how it would end.  Well, it seems the author got a little bored and just decided to end it.  The ending was terrible. TERRIBLE.  This book had so much potential and the storyline itself was interesting.  I really wish the author would have made the book longer and added an ending that would have made sense.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I am writing to let everyone know how AMAZING SATECHI customer service is!  I wrote a review here on amazon asking for help, not from satechi (not thinking they would have time to reply), but from anyone would could help me try to figure out what I was doing wrong with my fm transmitter and why it would play mostly static, I used the product following the directions, I plugged my ipod in with the USB cord provided, then into the input and through my cigeratte lighter, but all I heard was static and very little sound.  So my \\"review\\" was to ask for help, but someone from Satechi replied and said it was probably defective and told me that he would replace it.  And this was 4 months after I recieved my original product.  Then the only thing he asked for was my address, and only a few days later I received my replacement, and it works great!!!  I am so happy! Due to all the rave reviews, I had a feeling either it was defective or I was doing something wrong, and I was correct.  I just think Satechi customer service went above and beyond the call of duty and I think every company should follow in their foot steps!! I really feel like I have no words because I don't ever remember experiencing such great customer service, and can't believe how easy it was to get a replacement.  I just wish I would have done it sooner, but thought it would have been difficult to do since I recieved this as a Christmas present.  Thank you Satechi for the great product and surperb customer service!!!!!  1,000 stars for you!!!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game adds a very neat twist to the original game. I love how the gravity from the nearby planets pulls your birds towards them.(And how if you MISS the planet altogether, your bird floats off into space lol). I would recommend this game to anyone who likes angry birds.

It almost made me fall asleep with its mundane plot and lack of either any action or solid story line to keep your attention. Not one of JD's better roles, even though you thought he would live this part. Disappointing to say the least.

B000O176Q6|2.0|This has the worst HD transfer that I have ever seen.  Many of the scenes looked like bad internet video with visible pixelization.  Already have the DVD, don't bother with the blu ray.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|really enjoyable and more creative than others. I like the levels and two types of play.  good options for tiles and backgrounds.  Fun Artifacts aspect just adds to the interest.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|I like this game a lot,  but it needs to save my progress rather then reloading to level one if I lose. I finally passed a level then ended up losing one,  got sent all the way back to level and now I have to replay like five levels just to get where I was at. Its a good game,  it just needs to save my progress.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple concept with great execution and an attractive design. Enough levels, too, to both challenge you and make it worth the cost.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I loved Halestorm's first album and their sophomore effort does not disappoint.<br /><br />To be completely honest, there's more balls in the first 4 songs of this album than Phil Collins managed to have in an entire career. Strange Case Of... switches back and forth between rollicking rock and roll to ballad and back again. Lzzy claims to be Mz. Hyde in the second track of this album and that theme is carried throughout with the black and white colors and the sudden switches between ballad and faster-paced rock tracks. The second track weirdly skips near the end and I thought the CD was messed up at first, but I believe they put this in to add to the disorienting nature of the first 4 songs. The band certainly comes out swinging in this outing and even the ballads are very emotionally charged, as another reviewer pointed out.<br /><br />All in all, Halestorm has managed to put together an in-your-face rock and roll album the likes of which is missing from radio today. It's the kind of rock and roll that throws middle fingers to critics and haters. If you don't like it, then don't listen to it. It ain't for you.

190330766X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moQXA55B461DRT]]<br /><br />FOR IMMIGRATION LAW AND PRISON LAW PRACTITIONERS: A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY OVERVIEW  CONTAINING A NUMBER OF FIRSTS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />One of the latest publications from the Legal Action Group, this ambitious new work takes as its theme the treatment of foreign national prisoners in the UK.  In the foreword, Sir Nicholas Blake points out the major and obvious difference between the plight of a foreign national prisoner and that of a British national - and that is, the foreign prisoner faces deportation as well as the service of his or her sentence.<br /><br />In this major new work on such a difficult and complex subject, the grim process of deportation and the exemptions to deportation are carefully examined and certainly, in a number of areas, the book breaks new ground, containing as it does, a number of firsts. For example, this is the first multi, or inter-disciplinary guide to immigration law, prison law and false imprisonment.<br /><br />It offers the first comprehensive overview of prison law issues as they affect foreign national prisoners, including the issues of curfew, early removal, repatriation and the management of mentally ill prisoners.  Other firsts include: an in-depth examination of the best interests of the child in expulsion and detention cases... and the law and procedure of appeals in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC).<br /><br />The book is logically divided into three parts, with Part I - predictably the longest part - dealing with expulsion, which, as the author explains, is `the umbrella term referring to administrative removal and deportation.' Indeed the book guides the reader through the deportation process under EU law and also under a number of other conventions and directives. Prison law - a distinct field -- is dealt with in Part II, while Part III concerns immigration detention.<br /><br />As the book covers a wide area of law, straddling a number of disciplines, the authors have aimed to focus on issues specific to FNPs.  To this end, this thoroughly researched volume of almost 900 pages also includes, for example, a comprehensive analysis of the law and practice of deportation under the UK Borders Act 2007, an overview of the EHCR's Article 8 in criminal deportation cases and. of course, much more.<br /><br />The book is also a rich and valuable research resource, as it includes tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, as well as a table of EU and international legislation, plus a detailed index at the back,<br /><br />In the words of Sir Nicholas Blake, `it is useful to have all aspects of the law relating to the detention of foreigners all in one place.' Without doubt, this book is a boon to immigration law and prison law practitioners, as well as others directly and operationally involved in this field. The law is stated as at January 2012.he book covers a wide area of law, straddling a number of disciplines, the authors have aimed to focus on issues specific to FNPs.

0307474275|4.0|This book is nothing less than entertaining. If you like suspense, secret societies, or conspiracy theories, then this is a book is worth reading.<br /><br />Before I ever read any of Dan Browns novels, I always had heard them to be predictable, over the top, taboo monstroseties. (the reason I say taboo is because my family is Roman Catholic and to them, to say Jesus was married, with children was, well, preposterous.) But once I read Angels And Demons, I knew I had to finish the series. The writing styles Brown expressed made visualizing the novel easy. the story line, I admit, is a little hard to follow at the beginning, although once you're a few chapters in you wont be able to put the book down. you can't help but to appreciate the attention to detail portrayed in this masterpiece. If you haven't read this book yet you should at least give it a try, and you might find it to be worth your while.
B0061QD7YS|5.0|\\"Lady & the Tramp\\" is a wonderful Disney film. I got the Blu-Ray on the day it came out and I'm happy to say that I am very satisfied with the transfer. The sound and picture quality is amazing. What surprised me though is the fact that instead of using the 2006 CGI castle Walt Disney Pictures logo at the beginning, they leave the 1990 logo like on the Platinum Edition DVD. But that's just a minor complaint, nothing huge. The bonus features are great, however, they lack on the DVD. I truly enjoyed the introduction at the beginning by Dianne Disney Miller (Walt's daughter). I also liked the clips from the Disneyland TV show that were included on the Blu-Ray. This was also great for me because I missed out on getting the Platinum Edition DVD back in 2006, so now I get to enjoy this. I'm looking forward to the next two Diamond Edition titles being \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Aladdin.\\"
B0011UF79C|1.0|I was thoroughly enjoying this film until the last five minutes. No spoilers, but the end undermined the entire theme that I thought was building throughout. The protagonist Vincent does not create a new system and prove this draconian genetic world wrong. He instead finds a way to simply get ahead within the system. I compare this to Bradbury's classic work, Fahrenheit 451, that depicts a similar draconian, oppressive world, but gives us an entirely different ending. I will not even discuss the message the character of Eugene and his end sends to disabled people...
B001AKF3H4|5.0|I've never used the cloud to store anything before, but now I am a true user.  I can access my music anywhere and the quality is like using a brand new CD everytime.  Whitney Houston was a legend and she will be missed.
B007LB1O3I|4.0|The first single was kinda catchy, but nothing spectacular. The second single emerged and sounded dated. But then the video hit, and the whole album released, and taken together, it is a wonderful pop/dance creation. Ok, so Madonna is not as deep as she was on Ray of Light, but the music here is awesome, Some of the songs are reflective of her life and what she has gone through. Gang Bang alone is a great song of revenge on love gone bad, and Love Spent is a great song for a gold digger. There is no bad song but a few lackluster moments, such as I'm a Sinner and Superstar, but it helps to tie the album together, from serious and dark moments to something light and fluffy, and just fun. Do not expect scripture on this album. It will not make you smarter or deep. But it will give you the urge to dance and to look up an old ex and blow his head off. Easily one of the best she has done in the last few years. My advice? Get the deluxe...the bad words and violence is worth it.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The first time I heard of the Hunger Games was during the movie blitz--but I'm a reader. I bought the Kindle edition trilogy, and read almost non-stop `til late in the evening for three days.  Wow.<br />  I suspect anyone reading this review has some concept of the story, so I'll not address that.<br />  The book was written for and about teens, but it has a story that affects us all. As a 64 year old military veteran familiar with injuries and PTSD, I found the author's descriptions of combat, traumas and the after-effects of each to be chillingly realistic, but not overdone.  While the pain and violence become almost overwhelming in parts of the book, they are a necessary part of the development of the characters--you truly feel the character's pain, both physical and mental. I understand they toned down the movie--wise move.<br />  Comparing the book's dystopian politics with the present national political scene may cause you to be more concerned than ever about the motives of our leaders and wanna-be leaders.<br />  In short: The story presented in the Hunger Games trilogy will haunt you for a long time, but you will not regret reading it.

1439102724|1.0|I have been a fan of this writer since I read \\"19 minutes\\" and decided to purchase this book for a friend who had never read her work. Now that I have read it myself I am disappointed that \\"Sing You Home\\", in my opinion, does not represent what I loved about her past novels and was embarrassed that my friend could not experience what I had raved about. I had no trouble putting this novel down at all and only finished it in order to confirm that it would end as I predicted. Actually the best part for me was the last 3 pages related to Sammy ....<br />I don't normally submit book reviews because who am I to judge? but compared to some of her other novels, this does not match up.
034552554X|3.0|Goodreads Description- A mesmerizing, moving, and elegantly written debut novel, The Language of Flowers beautifully weaves past and present, creating a vivid portrait of an unforgettable woman whose gift for flowers helps her change the lives of others even as she struggles to overcome her own troubled past.<br /><br />The Victorian language of flowers was used to convey romantic expressions: honeysuckle for devotion, asters for patience, and red roses for love. But for Victoria Jones, it's been more useful in communicating grief, mistrust, and solitude. After a childhood spent in the foster-care system, she is unable to get close to anybody, and her only connection to the world is through flowers and their meanings.<br /><br />Now eighteen and emancipated from the system, Victoria has nowhere to go and sleeps in a public park, where she plants a small garden of her own. Soon a local florist discovers her talents, and Victoria realizes she has a gift for helping others through the flowers she chooses for them. But a mysterious vendor at the flower market has her questioning what's been missing in her life, and when she's forced to confront a painful secret from her past, she must decide whether it's worth risking everything for a second chance at happiness.<br /><br />I waited 4 months to get this book and when I finally got it I was so excited to read it.  Unfortunately, the book did not live up to my expectations.  There were many times that I slogged through the book when Victoria was talking about flowers and their meaning.  I kept at it because I kept focus on the story that was going on beneath the layer of the flowers.  The story was always told from Victoria's point of view but she switched back and forth in time, between the present and her time with Elizabeth.  Personally I liked the present story better until the end when the two finally meet and the reader gets a much better understanding of Victoria.<br /><br />That story was tragic, heartbreaking, and healing.  The life Victoria went through was tragic and to finally see her on the brink of making it and failing again was a huge disappointment.  I understood how she felt like she was unforgivable and incapable of love and you could see slow growth in Victoria's self-esteem as the book went along.  I wish the author would have spent a little bit more time on the backstory of Elizabeth, Catherine, and Grant.  She could have given them a greater place in the story so we could see how all the characters were connected.  The bottom line is that everyone feels not worthy at some point in their lives and that we are not alone in that feeling.  It is what we do with that feeling and where we go from there.  Do we heal or hurt?  How do we forgive ourselves and others?  Can we even do that?<br /><br />I am officially giving it 3.5 stars but since that isn't an option on here, I am going with a 3.  I liked it but it just didn't stand up to the hype surrounding it.healing.

B0058YPG2K|5.0|After watching the first 4 seasons, I convinced my skeptical son to take a look.  He watched all 4 seasons in 2 days.  This is the absolute best tv show I have ever seen, and I've been around awhile.  If you haven't watched it, start with Season 1, of course.  It's so addictive, I can't wait for another season to start.  I want to see when Jesse finds out Walt was at his house the night Jane died (spoiler!).
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Really enjoying this.  Kinda slow to start.  Need more energy and cash at start.  I don't play this with friends so I am working at it slower.

B006YM9JSW|5.0|I was building a new high end computer, and decided to go with this. I liked the price, and I wanted an LGA 2011 so the build would be almost future proof (at least for the next year.) I ran the Windows Experience Index test thing and the processor was rated a 7.7, the bottleneck of my build. I'm fine with that seeing as how I had a slight budget to deal with. The only issue I had with it wasn't even with this product. It was with the motherboard Gigabyte's GA-x79-UD5 and Corsair Vengeance RAM. These processors need so much cooling, and that makes the cooling system have to be large. I could not find an air cooler that would fit right. I ended up getting a Corsair H80 and the temps around idle are 19C-27C. I am happy for now. I may see if I can overclock it just to see if I can get it at a perfect 7.9 :)

I've found the introductions, diagrams, and footnotes to be immensely helpful as well as the contextual essays that accompany various parts of the volume. My video review shows you these and more. The things I've learned have been amazing and insightful. I highly recommend this version for anyone looking to discover more about the Bible.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|Externally:  It is very small.  Just a little bit bigger than a deck of card.  The whole thing and buttons are made out of metal.  It is a joy to touch.  Screen is nice and brighter.  Bottons are solid.  There  is no fault that I can find from the design and built.  It is perfect.<br /><br />Sound:  I own the Sennheiser Hd598 and the Denon ADH2000.  I hooked both to my laptop directly and they give loose bass and not very clear sound.  When I hook my e17 up, the sound comes alive.  The e17 makes the sound tigher,  clearer, and very smooth.  The mid and vocal are especially smooth and sweet.  Bass is tighter and hit harder.  Treble is clearer.  There is nothing to complain.<br /><br />Is it a worthy purchase?  I would say YES.  So buy this if you love music and listen to music daily.  At this price, there is nothing on the market that can beat it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this by request from my 12 year old daughter, who loves this series. The book has a gruesome theme, but is told in an elegant manner so its not bad for that pre-teen to teen age at all. I started the book on a cross US flight and finished it before we landed on my kindle app. I was amazed at how quickly I was able to get through it. The story just flowed, and in some cases I felt like it maybe went too fast. Perhaps my only knock on it is that it would have been nice to get to know some of the characters little deeper.<br /><br />The story reminds me of The Most Dangerous Game a bit, though this obviously a very different story. Similar theme of people hunting each other for sport. It also has a bit of The Lottery, to me. Both great stories.<br /><br />I look forward to the rest of the series and highly recommend the Hunger Games.

All James does is clone the characters from Twilight (Everyone knows this originated as fanfiction on a Twilight fan site, right?), so that we have a book about a virginal girl (read: Bella) needing an identity and somehow ONLY able to get that from one thing in life, a man (aren't most human beings fulfilled by at least two different things? Have you ever known anyone who is THAT one dimensional?) and wanting to be dominated for her own good by that man (read: Edward) who needs to abuse her because he is such a tormented demon that only his love for her will save him.<br /><br />The writing is embarrassingly bad, with lines like, \\"He looks at me hungrily. Jeez, my inner goddess swoons. Am I up to this game?\\" And in case you think that's only one example, I did a search for the inner goddess phrase on my Kindle so that I could find one to cite here, and there were 59 such gems. Okay, I can't spend another moment thinking about this book because my time is too precious, but I just wanted to post this and try and save at least one other person from reading it.
0439023521|1.0|In the distant future, the place we call North America has changed and is now called Panem.  From the capitol, the government rules through fear, forcing the twelve districts it governs to hand over two of it children from the ages twelve to eighteen to participate in the Hungar Games; the players must fight to survive or die.  When Kantiss's sister gets selected in the lottery, Kantiss asks to take her place.<br /><br />Kantiss comes from District 12, which is not as well off as some of the other districts, and since the death of her father, it has been up to Kantiss to take care of her mother and younger sister.<br /><br />I found the storyline unbelieveable, and the characters unsympathetic.  As a character, I didn't buy into Kantiss at all; she seemed clueless for someone who, in my opinion, has a high intelligence.  A lot of the vocabulary that she used just made her that more unbelieveable; granted she went to school, but it seemed like she would be more interested in taking care of her family than getting anything out of her schooling.<br /><br />The book is told in first person, present tense.  While I think telling the story in the first person was the only way to tell the story, I don't think telling it in the present tense worked.  Was the author trying to create some measure of suspense?  If that was the case, it didn't work.  I found myself skipping over portions of this book, just to get further along in it.  I am surprised that I actually finished this book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great app. hours of fun. Love how the characters interact with you. also love the unexpected disasters that occur from time to. time.
B005LAIHAY|3.0|Nobody makes movies quite like Lockout anymore. The only person who does is Luc Besson, the French film maker who has been perpetually stuck in the 1990s, really the heyday of his significant career. Even as a producer he hires guys to make essentially the same movie with a slightly different coat of paint. Movies like Taken, The Transporter, and Colombiana. They all feature heroes with jaws like granite(even Zoe Saldana was a bit rough around the edges) who don't open their mouths unless it's to say something quippy. The bad guys come in only two flavors: either they look like Nazi skinheads who stumbled under the needle of a blind tattoo artist, or they look like extras from The Matrix. Shadowy government types lurk around every corner.<br /><br />And yet there's a certain charm to a movie like Lockout, ridiculous in its overflowing machismo and mediocre special effects. Its a throwback to the days when every action hero didn't need to be that great of a guy, as long as they occasionally say something funny and get the girl in the end. Guy Pearce, who no longer remotely resembles the guy who starred in Christopher Nolan's Memento, plays a tough as nails, quick witted ex-government agent(aren't they all???) named Snow. When we meet him, in the whip smart and outrageously funny(\\"I'm being beaten up by a guy named Rupert?\\") opening minutes, Snow is being interrogated(read: tortured) by the head of Secret Service, seeking answers for a crime Snow may or may not have committed. Railroaded, Snow is to be sent to prison on MS-One, a deep space prison full of the world's worst criminals.<br /><br />Before any of that happens, the President's daughter, Emilie Warnock(Maggie Grace) goes on a diplomatic mission to MS One to make sure the deep sleep process the inmates are placed under is humane, but instead winds up a prisoner herself when a jailbreak occurs. Guess who gets to show up and reluctantly save the day? You get one guess. Snow gets to drop in like Snake Plissken, beat back the frantic, barely intelligible thugs running the joint, and secure himself a Presidential pardon if he gets the job done. It doesn't go well, and when he's not busy trying not to end up on the business end of some con's shank, he has to put up with the feisty Emilie who has her own agenda.<br /><br />Pearce gives this film the comedic punch and necessary swagger it needs to overcome the shoddy special effects. Some of the jabs he hurls at Maggie Grace, with whom he shares some pretty good chemistry, will remind you of old school Bruce Willis. The problem is the film can't really keep up the pace established in the brilliant, action packed first five minutes. As the momentum staggers, the glaring weaknesses in the CG animated sequences become more of an issue. A Star Wars inspired aerial dogfight is embarrassingly bad, worse than what you can find in an average Playstation video game. There's also the issue of Snow not really having an enemy worth talking about. Grace, who played Taken's damsel in distress, is in much the same position here although her character proves to be more than capable.<br /><br />None of this totally sinks the film, however, and  for those who loved movies like Die Hard, Escape from New York or anything in the 80s with Carl Weathers or Arnold Schwarzenegger, you can do worse than spending 90 minutes in outer space with Lockout.beat back the frantic, barely intelligible thugs running the joint, and secure himself a Presidential pardon if he gets the job done.

1449305172|4.0|Part of the LEAN series which started with The Lean Start-up. This is the workbook for the The Lean Start-up and more. Lean development rose out of the AGILE camp and remains a major POV for the technology development sector.  My interest comes from experience with companies that start into AGILE but, fail to implement it in their management structure/style.  This LEAN series is a good way to start on changing how to manage companies who are innovators.  A very few folks are writing about adopting AGILE techniques in sales and marketing , but it will come.  A few key bullets for me from this very clear and well written book.<br /><br />  Build only the Minimum Value Product - always testing customer response.<br />  Look for Minimum Marketing Features (what customers value - and you would write up)<br />  Use Kanban charts ( from The Toyota Way ) to organize and constrain workflow<br />  Done = validated with learning from customers<br />  Measure product marketing fit all the time.<br /><br />On Freemium (he is not a fan) :<br /><br />  Delays learning about what price buyers will pay<br />  Low or no conversion - give away too much<br />  Lengthens validation cycle<br />  Shift focus to wrong metric - signups vs retention<br />  Low signal to noise ration - what is important feedback<br />  Free users are not free - account for free users as a marketing expense<br /><br />Mailchimp started with a paid version and after much time backed into a free one. Users should easily outgrow a free plan.  This is LinkedIn's issue. IMHO.  Buy this book and The Lean Startup. Thanks O'Reilly
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very awesome game keep updating. my review is now officially twenty letters long after I put these last few words
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I cannot even get the game working. It loads to 53% then turns off and I can't do anything to fix it. Waste of my time to download it.
B004UUKD6W|5.0|This album is very enjoyable. It literally is a \\"pure rock\\" version of \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" by the Beatles. It has the same effect to your ears, you want to listen to it over and over and over! The Sheer Heart Attack EP is enjoyable too, you won't regret having the 2011 remaster one bit!
B004I4H8QS|5.0|The first disc of this set is the same as the many other releases. The second disc has several outtakes and an appearance of the band on the Johnny Cash show. This is interesting for the devotee.
014241039X|5.0|no matter what age you are there are metaphors and alot to comprehend and relate to upon reading this book. it shows about balance and understanding and also it puts a importance of accepting and respecting one another.  in a direct and not so direct manner and way. its a easy book to digest however  no matter how old one is, there is still so much to learn about the simple issues of respect and understanding offered by the author.
B007S1RGUQ|5.0|No need to gush on and give detail when others have said it already.  Just wanted to add my praise by way of a genuine 5 star rating.  Way to go Bonnie.  Love this disc.

B0064BWDRW|5.0|This book is a typical Jo Nesbo book.  Interesting, tight plot and plenty of surprises. I love it. Recommended to all fans of great police stories.
B005CAAU76|5.0|Queen WILL entertain you if you listen to this album. The remastered album sounds soooooooooooo good. I wonder why? Maybe it's because these remasters, and this \\"Jazz\\" too, were \\"meticulously recreated from the original tapes using the finest analog and digital technology.\\" Of course that's why! Then, when you reach the end of the record, you get a \\"reminder!\\" of it all, on \\"More Of The Jazz\\" which gives ROCK music a big PLUS when compared to other genres, especially Jazz!<br /><br />Also, the Jazz EP that comes with this remaster is very enjoyable too, example being the single version of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" which is *short and sweet* single rocker!<br /><br />Overall, Jazz will make you HAPPY!
B006OAB3ME|3.0|Not Paul's best effort and I've been a huge fan since the 60s.  The best song on the album is the Valentine one that he sang on the Grammys.  He should stick to rock 'n roll!
B0074EIQUG|4.0|i'm relaly digging this record and I have always dug me  Dr. John.  this is the kind of record from him that I can get with. He has always had that funky attitude in his voice and especially in his playing and this record easily feels like him doing what he does best which is mix up his own musical gumbo and bring it directly to your ears. this is a good record and well Produced and Dr John  has made a happening record.

B00782O7NE|4.0|You have to hand it to writer and director Michel Hazanavicius for coming up with this idea and especially that it works so well. The technical aspects are well done. Everyone knows the film has no sound, well almost. There is a dream sequence where George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) hears sounds but he has no voice. And of course the film is accompanied by an orchestrated soundtrack. It even has the 4:3 (or 1.33:1 if you prefer) aspect ratio, the same as the original theater screens. Then there are the title cards which tell us what the actors are saying. Like the original silent films, these aren't used often as the actor's job is to let us know what's going on with their performance. Unlike many of the original silent films, you can actually see what the actor's are saying because the picture is clear enough to read their lips. So the title cards pretty much enforce what we've already heard...ahem, seen.<br /><br />The story really isn't new. It is a mash up of \\"Singing in the Rain,\\" the 1952 Gene Kelly masterpiece and the numerous iterations of \\"A Star is Born.\\" Valentin is the most successful actor of his time. Handsome, rugged, witty and very charming. He meets Peppy Miller, a perfectly named wannabe actress/dancer played by long-stemmed Argentine beauty Berenice Bejo. As the silent film era transitions to \\"talkies\\", Valentin doesn't. At the same time, the adorable Peppy rises to the top. Valentin loses his fortune after his self financed final film tanks and the stock market crashes. It's 1929 and George is penniless, yet still proud and defiant. After a struggle with the bottle he attempts suicide but is eventually saved by his very cute dog and then by Peppy.<br /><br />While their relationship remains chaste throughout, there is a smoldering fire within each of them. Initially, George's marriage gets in the way, but his wife (Penelope Ann Miller) leaves him before all his money is lost. I watch lot of old black and white movies and even silent ones, so I was not in shock seeing this film. What may be surprising is that once you get past that, there is a wonderful romantic drama delivered by two talented actors.<br /><br />Update:  Winning the Oscar for best picture as well as lead actor and director, \\"The Artist\\" seemed needing a second look.  Knowing the story pretty well I tried to focus on the technical aspects of the film.  One of the things I noticed early on was the staging.  And for the most part they got it spot on.  There is one scene where George (Jean Dujardin) is leaving the executive studio after pitching his new movie and he runs into Peppy (Berenice Bejo) on a stairwell heading the opposite direction. The facade of the office is just like they did it during the silent era.  I also noticed the title cards carry longer pieces of dialog than they did in the 1920's, and were better synched.  They also were in view for a much briefer period.  I guess we are expected to be faster readers.<br /><br />Dujardin did deserve his acting award, managing to run the full range of emotion without using words, but I was a little surprised he did win.  I say this for the same reason Ms. Bejo didn't.  Neither is well known on this side of the pond and was up against some beloved actors.  Bejo certainly deserved her nomination and in fact has just about as much screen time as Dujardin, so her nomination as supporting actress is another one of the Academy head-scratchers.  Also worth mentioning are true supporting roles played by James Cromwell as a chauffeur for both stars, John Goodman as a film producer/director and of course Uggy, the Jack Russell terrier who steals every scene he's in.  This is a beautiful film to watch even with a reliable story line.  Remarkably unusual, yet familiar.not in shock seeing this film.

B005HSL626|5.0|this game is great and challenging at the same time. its hard to complete a level. but let me tell you you cant sstop playing it until you do.. that's just how I feel. u should try it!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|There are sometimes wierd glitches that exit the game. An annoying glicth and this has happened to other people was that the time would be wrong. I had a chicken and said I had to wait 84 hours to reseve tolhe money. Then later half of my bunisses and all my animals said I had to wait 84 hours. And it is lieing. You will never get it!!!

B006RUJST6|5.0|I had never heard of Slammed until someone on Facebook mentioned it. Intrigued by the title I headed over to GR to look at some reviews and was blown away by the comments and high average rating for a book that only so few have heard of. Well... I saw that Slammed's obscurity hasn't lasted long and it's taking off in the bestseller's lists and I'm not surprised. I predict that if the book ever falls under Hollywood's radar that it won't be long before author Colleen Hoover will hear a knock at the door for film option.<br /><br />I opened my kindle to have a squint at Slammed before I went to bed and ended up staying up to 3am to finish it.<br /><br />Told from the first person narrative of mc Lake, the reader is immediately pulled into her earthen, real and sad story as she moves from Texas to Michigan following the unexpected death of her father. On the first day she meets neighbor Will, and Hoover does a truly magical job (perhaps one of the best I've ever read) of creating an authentic and instant connection between the two. A few days after meeting, everything falls apart for Lake, and we travel through her story feeling every emotion, every shock and every epiphany. Slammed is a beautifully told story, enhanced by the insertion of some truly moving Slam poetry. It's funny because a friend of mine had only just introduced me to some powerful Slam poetry on Youtube a few weeks before reading this. I'm definitely sending Slammed her way.<br /><br />What more can I really say without giving away plot points that really need to be discovered by the reader. All I can say is that this isn't oversentimental or cheesy. It's real and moving ... I think mostly because it reminds us all that even when the world seems to be throwing one bad thing after another at us, there's always someone out there going through bad stuff too. Moreover, we have to learn to remember that so we don't feel victimized by fate and more importantly we have to learn to see promise in everythingelse so it doesn't get tainted by the bad.<br /><br />Awesome read. Can't wait to read part two.

0316098337|1.0|THE BOOK WAS BAD. It was bad. Really bad. I mean - so bad that even though I had run out of books to read on my 11 day trip - I still could not finish this book. Not only that - my teenage daughter - could not finish it. We left it in the hotel on our vacation. Maybe one of the maids will like it! But I do not care. It was that bad.
B0060CSEFA|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite live-action Disney movies of all time. They depict the dogs as having fantastic personalities despite their inability to speak. Roger and Anita are passionate and compassionate. Glenn Close plays the exact version of Cruela I imagined. She's cruel and selfish and vindictive. If you loved the animated version, don't let the idea of a remake get in your way. This film is brilliant.
B00632HWOG|5.0|it works perfectly for my kindle. I don&quot;t know what everybody is talking about. this app does not deserve three stars.

B004J1DBJI|1.0|Pretty good app (or even the best) if you are interested in math and statistics.<br />Just one *  for bad UI -- back button closes app. This is Android, and I expect it will go back in history.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I've had this app for a while but have really only tested it one of my laptop (the one I normally have TeamViewer on to tap into my files), but it has worked great for pretty much what I'd use it for 95% of the time.<br /><br />Phone: Samsung Infuse<br />Laptop: HP 15\\" Win7<br /><br />There's a little bit of a learning curve since the laptop doesn't have a touch screen and is significantly larger than the phone's screen.  However, it was pretty painless.  The pointer follows your finger but doesn't work like, say, a Wacom graphic tablet where the cursor appears where you put your finger and you instead have to manually move it.  This makes it a touch odd (not bad, per se, just odd) to navigate.<br /><br />In terms of getting all the larger screen's content onto the phone screen, this is basically just a scaled down issue.  It's hard to describe, but part of how TeamViewer makes things still viewable is that it scales the [PC] screen down to a manageable size but doesn't bother to scale it down to fit completely onto the phone.  This means you will have to scroll around a bit to see things if you've got icons all over your desktop, but it does mean you'll find things still legible.  Moreover, chances are good that you're not using TeamViewer [the app] the same way you would use it when you're on another computer, so emphasizing legibility is a plus since you're probably wanting to either grab a file or something where you want to do it quick, thus making legibility a more important factor.<br /><br />Overall, a great little app, especially if you've already got TeamViewer setup on your computers because all you really need to do then install the app and get down to work.<br /><br />A note for those who might not be familiar with programs like this: you will need to install the TeamViewer program (free for non-professional use) on the computer you want to access.  This is true of all programs of this type.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case fits my iPhone 4 nicely. The cutouts are generous to allow easy access to all ports and buttons. The case also features a lay-on-the-table design, meaning if you put your iPhone screen-side first, it will protect it. As others have mentioned, Amazon did slap an \\"amazon basics\\" logo on the bottom of the case, although I don't mind it personally. Also, as others have mentioned, the Apple logo on the backside of the one is cutout. I am not too fond of this design choice, as the case is transparent as it is, but all I did was took the included screen protector, cut out a square and slapped it over the Apple logo to protect it from scratches as the case leaves it open. I recommend you do this, as well. One of the major downsides in my opinion is that due to the bulk of the product, it is a little awkward to hold your iPhone in the hand. I am sure you would get used to it sooner or later.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good case for shock protection, and even a little stylish too.

B0055SWM08|4.0|Very fun and addicting! But some are very hard... The only negitive thing is if you only make a certain amount of moves you only get 1 hint. And when you want/need to use a hint, it cost to coins....

B004EBT5CU|3.0|Adele's voice deserves five stars, the audio production on this CD deserves one star - it very much lacks the transparency that would let Adele's voice sound its best.  There are other sonically ugly things going on as well - some of the instruments have a tin can sound to them.  Adele sounds better in every other forum in which I've heard her - from the Grammy's to live radio broadcasts.
B0024396WE|3.0|Quiet Audio:  I watched the movie using my home theater system.  The 5.1 surround audio is soo quiet I had to turn up the volume to the maximum setting, the voices were still very quiet and hard to understand, the action was loud but not crazy loud like you would expect.    Subtitles Broken:  I tried to turn on the sub titles so my girlfriend could read along as it was too quiet and some of the accents are hard for her to understand, but the subtitles don't work either.  The only time the subtitles worked is when there was a German sign being translated like 'No Jews', and at the beginning of the credits a subtitle thing came up telling you what company or whatever you should thank for the subtitle that didn't work.    I am very unhappy with this, I love the movie but this is basically unwatchable.  I did not try switching the audio off the 5.1 surround, maybe that would make it louder if it was just in stereo.  Also, I'm a movie and a home theater buff so I know for a fact there was nothing wrong with my setup to cause this to happen.  I watch at least one movie a day and have experienced this problems with a few other movies before.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie and as a Jurassic Park fanatic, this could not be a better product. The movie is shown in great Hi Definition and I am able to see things I never saw on the DVDs (which I watched hundreds of times). The features are great. I love seeing the behind the scenes work and I am happy that I can now put it on my portable devices. Especially since I have android devices and this has never been possible before. Then there's the T-Rex statute which is perfect. I love having it in my room. Its an overall amazing product
B005CAAVVQ|4.0|Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue simply blew the crowd away at this year's Byron Bay Bluesfest. A large portion of the 80,000 punters flocked to the Mojo tent to witness what can only be described as 'one of those once-in-a lifetime experiences'.  Australian audiences have adopted him and can't get enough! He needs to put out a LIVE recording asap!! No studio recording can really capture his amazing talent and this backing band was unbelievably tight and a perfect match for his talents. In the meantime we must settle for the studio versions. Not a bad option in the meantime!  [...]
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is absolute rubbish! It is presented as erotica, but in my opinion it is poorly written, boring drivel. I wasted my money!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is...bad.  The plot is bizarre and completely unrealistic.  The main characater is two-dimensional and uninteresting.  The author is terribly repetitive with word choice and romance scenes. I got very tired of the \\"inner goddess\\" and the subconcious of the main character popping up every 5 lines.<br /><br />Basically, I feel like the average person with access to Microsoft Word could have written this book in High School English class.
B00000JZI9|5.0|Kevin Costner plays the most hilarious character in this movie. His depiction is so different from any other role I have seen him in. This movie is worth watching just to see Kevin Costner's performance!
B004ZJZQ5G|3.0|The audio on 5.1 is very very quiet, had to turn the volume up to near the maximum to hear the voices, all other sounds are super loud at that volume.
B0055SWM08|5.0|surprisingly good. no bells. or whistles (thank goodness) . just little puzzels requiring some thought and planning. my kind of games
B0063IH60K|5.0|just like the classic.<br />great for airplanes<br />can be addictive.<br />I like how you can change the background and cards
B001R60ESE|5.0|I purchased this disk as I had heard that the sound quality was good and was 7.1 as well.  I was expecting it to sound good but was blown away by the fantastic quality of both the sound and the video. Great performances by Chris and all his guests as well.  Thanks!
0439023521|5.0|I purchased all 3 books in this trilogy for a friend, but had to return the items due to carrier issues. Amazon took the best care of me. They have great customer service!!! I also read the trilogy, and they are all quick reads. I got sucked in right away.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Many have critisized James's writing ability. So yes, maybe she uses a bit of the same catch phrases here and there and the repetitive orgasms can be described differently only so many times, but James does an amazing job at engaging the reader from the start and forcing you to feel every emotion and feeling that Anasthasia experiences. This is what I believe makes a good book. An author who can take you away from your every day life and make you feel something from the words on a page is a great author in my opinion! I loved the entire trilogy and I would definitely read it again given the chance!
B001HUHBAE|5.0|Many people complain about movies that run at a greater length of time than usual. Zodiac is that rare exception that makes the viewer lose themselves into the police procedural's used to catch one of the most infamous serial murderers in history. The story aside it's just another example of how great a director David Fincher is and how great performances carry a movie. This may Be 2 1/2 hours plus but it doesn't seem that way. Hope this gets a reissue because it deserves better than being phased out and ridiculously non-affordable.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|\\"Danger, Danger, Will Robinson\\".<br /><br />This game is addictive.  I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire and was playing it.  My wife asked what are you playing, and she had to add it to hers.  Now she cannot put it down.  The game is challenging and beats solitaire (all versions) for interest level.  The visual layout and design of the tiles and background are well done and add to the desirability of the game.<br /><br />BTW it is so addictive I had to remove it from my Kindle.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|My Dad had been talking about wanting to transfer his hundreds of cassette tapes for years now, so I bought him this as a gift and he loved it! It was so simple to setup and use, and the quality of the output was right on par with the cassette sounds. It converted all of his tapes to MP3s. The only downside is that you have to sit there and listen to each song play through to start/stop in between songs which play at real-time speed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great graphics, awesome soundtrack, and fun gaming experience. the puzzles start off easy enough, but man, do they become challenging. puzzle enthusiasts will love this game.
0439023491|5.0|I purchased all 3 books in this trilogy for a friend, but had to return the items due to carrier issues. Amazon took the best care of me. They have great customer service!!! I also read the trilogy, and they are all quick reads. I got sucked in right away.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing cards to it gets my mind working and keeps me thinking. spider is a great game to do just that.
B004GYY714|5.0|I found this app on Amazon and thought it would be great to have on my 7\\" android tablet. The selection of music is fantastic and I love the fact that I can just relax and listen to the radio or do other things on my tablet while I listen to my favorite music. I like the fact that you can preset your favorite stations so there is no searching around trying to find them again. The variety of radio stations is really good ... there is something for everyone! If you like to listen to the radio, this is the app for you!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|MUST SEE!!!  Fantastic series.  Couldn't stop watching. I would recommend all to see this beautiful British series. Looking forward to season 3 starting.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Bound forever to suffer the fate of misunderstood genius, this works equally as exploration of perception and identity, celebratory fantasy and sci-fi genre pastiche, and nerd's wet dream-- but it is first and foremost a gorgeous piece of magical realism.  It's like when the band Drain from Sweden came out-- you might have thought it was too good to be true, but you would have been wrong.
0439023513|2.0|As most of the reviews I have read, I agree with being disappointed in the last of the trilogy. By the time I get to the Epilogue I need to take a zoloft.  I get it, it's about war, revolution, and not knowing who to trust. Yet, the third book seems to slog through so much military lingo; do they want her fighting, on film trying to encourge the rebels...She and Gale seem to just wing it with bows and arrows. She has a film crew following her, but it doesn't seem too plausible. It's not a film crew battle ready. Some how the gamesmakers were more creative with what the tributes encountered than what the capitol had rigged in the streets of thier own city. Really, mutts took out people in a subway system who were armed with army battle gear?<br />Where the heck is Peeta, he is missing in most of the book. He seems to be the voice of reason and Katniss knows by the first third of the book that he is the guy who makes her a better person. Gale is still a close friend, but he has gotten caught up in the invention of snares on a grander scale that produce the most damage. Regardless of who the victems are. (Obvious when they are facing the Mountain in District Two). Katniss is badly burned and in some sort of drug induced state through most of the book. We hear of the Capitol falling, but no news of what is happening in the streets. What is being done to stabalize the country? The very person Katniss has been trying to protect for the very first reaping is Prim who is gone in a flash. Any of the Characters who were colorful and positive are dead.  Katniss is in a burn unit healing, but so is Peeta, what, they didn't speak, see each other, what? Why is Katniss recouperating in the Presidents house? Weird. The only positive thought; which took me a couple of days, was the thought by shooting Coin and the death of Snow quickly following was that she had took out two dictators. Yet, even after that I still kept thinking about small details that were left hanging. What happened to the pearl Peeta gave her? Katniss has hung on to it from book two into book three.(Joanna is curious what is in Katniss's drawer.) Where did it go? Why was Peeta, the very charming personality not on the radio talking to the rebels, Katniss is the fighter, but Peeta could get people's attention. District 13 had managed to get broadcast sent to most of the districts;they had the technology to interupt Snow's speeches. What did Coin have to gain by sending Prim into the frontline battle at the Presidents house? Where was Prim's Mother when that decision was made?<br />Then the Epilogue, it's as if the author ran out of time. Ok, I understand that tramatic events mess people up, but really. Nightmares and flashbacks are plausible, but it's as if Katniss was made to have children. Questioning the future and deciding to have children is difficult for most parents, but couldn't she act like she enjoyed them just a little! She is disapointed in Gale and perhaps he played a part in devising the very explotions that killed Prim, I could see how it would be hard to forget that. This is not a book for a fairy tale ending,and it does not resemble a love triangle either, but I think the main charcters deserved to be shown in a more positive light instead of just a bunch of hollow messed up people.

B006ZZC3D6|3.0|I'd downloaded this because of a note that it was like Quell. Nope! Only if Quell was just raindrops in a maze.  They could at least take a cue from Angry Birds and have different types of fuzzies that move in different ways. The graphics are very detailed but I kinda wish they weren't... Eats battery for no reason, and strangely bugs my eyes where other games don't.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Probably Disney's best animated movie.  I love it then and my grandchildren love it now.  It is truly classic Disney.  Thank you Amazon for sending it to them.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|holy flapping face tarts this is the greatest app ever and I haven't even downloaded it yet so without hesitating I did ur mom in a jiffy so I could get back to this app see y'all later ya hear now

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Original but classic game play. Graphics are awesome. Using a kindle fire. controls are easy and the levels are challenging.  I recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first time I ever write a book review. Wool omnibus made me think a lot about our future. I hope we will not self destruct as a society, or if we do, that I am long gone. Hugh, thank you for the message. This book made me appreciate what I have right now. I can not wait for any follow up on the life of the people in the different silos. Did they get to talk to each other? Did the  stranded got to have a relationship with the first Silo and to the rest?
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to customize the settings to personalize app. Fun to play, bigger graphics easy to read. Fun to play. Like this game a whole lot better than other apps.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is just an amazing app...when ever u get bored,it is a great way to keep u occupied and busy...I HIGHLY reccomend this app for anyone who gets very bored...this game is SOOOOOOOOOO much fun and I just cant stop playing it...but also don't just get it,to get it...play the game and make sure that u know how to play the game...have a fun time playing... byee
0756404738|2.0|I just finished reading The Wise Man's Fear today, the follow up book to the excellent Name of the Wind. 1,266 pages (says my Nook) and I am sad to say I wasn't impressed. Especially since I really enjoyed the first book!<br /><br />This is, in my laymans opinion, one of those cases where it feels like the author was sleeping with their editor. As in, why wasn't someone doing their job and cutting the novel down by roughly half? I enjoy long books, but there was far too much author indulgence here and the story needed to progress much faster than it did.<br /><br />Kvothe is supposed to have done all these amazing things... And he does, eventually. Unfortunately, we spend an inordinate amount of time in each setting diddling around before we finally get to the meat of any particular plot point - only to spend another couple hundred pages with painstakingly detailed indulgence in already covered ground. It's a testament to fan loyalty that the book is so well reviewed when in reality very little new progress was made in any of the major plot points that supposedly drive Kvothe. You know, like finding those who killed his parents?<br /><br />Given how much we're teased with about how Kvothe got to where he is today, a shadow of the man he was as a teen, Rothfuss is going to have to cram a hell of a lot of story into the next book. Or, perhaps more likely, the next book will simply run closer to 2,500 pages long. I'm undecided.<br /><br />I would have loved the book, and the amount of story progression, at a reduced number of pages. It's a shame, and I hope the next (and last) book shows both more restraint and more development.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Cool game runs great on the kindle! I downloaded it for my 9 year old and he loves it and I really do too.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is tons of fun to play at school after a class I check my settlmrnt so stay swabbing kiddies!!!!!!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|this is a remake of smb and it not illegal nintendo said that you can make copys of there games but you can not sell them for money thus make this legal.<br />this is an ok game as I said before is just anthoner smb game but this one is one of the better ones none of the levels are from smb it basically smb with new levels.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played this game on android and apple. Both are the same and great fun. Goes fast and is challenging
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game. strategy game.  very fun. oh yea. perfect time consumer. great for when your bored. life on the farm.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder tells the story of Auggie Pullman, a 10 year old boy born with a multi-syllabic, nearly-impossible-to-pronounce facial deformity. Because of numerous surgical procedures and medical needs, as well as fear over being bullied or ostracized, his parents have kept him from attending public school. But at the beginning of 5th grade, they decide to enroll him at Beecher Prep, and now Auggie must overcome more staring, whispering, and ill-treatment than he's ever experienced, and maybe teach his peers a few things in return.<br /><br />I love Auggie's family in this book. Mom, Dad, and sister Via are not perfect, and Palacio's honest portrayal of a family that loves, argues, makes mistakes, and fights for each other is touching and relatable.<br /><br />I also love that the book is told from several different perspectives, some of them unexpected. It not only brought me closer to each character, but helped me see Auggie's situation - and how it affected those around him - in a much fuller landscape.<br /><br />There were times I was brought to tears by the simple tenderness of Palacio's writing, the gut-wrenching honesty and plainness of it. This is one time I was happy to have a print copy of the book (vs on my ereader), because it was easier for me to flip back through and re-read favorite passages, marking some as I went along.<br /><br />You get the sense in Wonder that each of the characters - good, bad, or seemingly indifferent - are just doing the best they can. I often wondered while reading how I would react to being the mother, sister, friend of someone with such a severe deformity, or how I would react if it were me instead. There is so much raw, honest, human emotion in this book, it's easy to put yourself in any of the character's shoes.<br /><br />With Wonder, R.J. Palacio gives a master class on grace, compassion, tolerance, and love. It is what I consider a \\"redemptive\\" book, one that leaves you feeling changed and somehow better for having read it.
B004LWZW4M|1.0|Where do I begin...does anyone remember the deathly dull PROJECT X (1987) starring Matthew Broderick and Helen Hunt?  If not, it's available on DVD--watch the Trailer on YouTube (Search for: \\"Project X-Trailer #7-1987\\").  RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is an **extreme** version of PROJECT X with many similar plot points and far more action, violence and mayhem.  RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is worth watching ONCE--just to see how derivative and devoid of ideas it is...  I'd give it ZERO stars, but Amazon.com doesn't allow it...so ONE star it is...
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love it! can't put it down. I like how you can earn hint by finding the question marks. I think it's worth the money.
0937381888|5.0|My boyfriend has recently gotten into making his own beer. Unfortunately we had spent quite a bit of money and time goofing up his first few batches even after following instructions from the beer making kit he got. I got him this book and he's learned a lot and has since made some palatable beer. I'd recommend it to anyone who is just starting out in beer making or considering beer making as it can help you with some common things and from the potential heartbreak of buying supplies and waiting weeks to find you've made soap flavored beer.
B0055SWM08|5.0|i am not a fan  of most games but find this relaxing, engaging and addictive. great background music. Easy and short levels.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is one of the best games on my kindle fire. beautifully designed and executed. wish it had more levels. hope they are coming soon.
B0055SWM08|5.0|can be very addicting. very relaxing music. some of the puzzles can be difficult. I really like it. th ankh for the free app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I usually don't have time to read a book, but I love this book on Kindle.  This way I can read while I am working out, traveling, etc...  This book was so good - I couldn't put it down!  A definite must read!
B0055SWM08|5.0|The music is relaxing and it is a fun game that can take some thought but not too much :)
B000C1YL1G|5.0|I'm really happy I bought this...I coulnd't but it uncensored anywhere around me & I finally got what I love, Eminem unabashed & funny as hell!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is fun and addictive with endless gameplay and fun survival tactics. It is fun to be able to form your own town and interact with the villagers.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I think this game is very nicely done. It runs great and looks great also. Awesome for free but worth a purchase.
B007R41E8O|5.0|great game....keeps u guessing. good graphics.<br />cant wait to see how it ends.  hope there is more games<br />by this company. one of the best ones ive played so far.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|It took me a few years to finally plunk down the cash to buy this most incredible box set.  For many years I searched high and low to find the best vinyl pressings I could afford only to be left somewhat disappointed since I could never afford the \\"best\\" versions i.e. UK pressings.  For the cost of a mediocre vinyl copy of a single title you are now able to purchase all the Beatles in mono on cd. These versions are simply stunning assuming you have a great system to listen on.  Highly recommended!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is exactly like Mario except different characters. epic app. download it. now. no seriously. down load it now. ugh download it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like being able to pull out my Bible wherever I am at. This is very user-friendly. I appreciate the plans and absolutely think that it is wonderful to have so many versions at my disposal.  I highly recommend this app.
B004VB3UYW|5.0|Despite what has been said by some other reviewers I would not use this book as your only introduction, because it is not designed to be that, and I think that [[ASIN:1593273843 The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design]]<br />gives a better explanation of what is happening deep down in the language. Nevertheless this book is very useful, for someone who is starting out, I suppose for intermediate users, but I doubt that a very experienced user will get much out of it.<br />It's very good for someone who is looking for a quick solution, but as in all cookbooks it's not exhaustive-how could it be<br />in such a short place. This is why I think that a second edition will be welcome, so that it covers more ground.<br /><br />The writing style is absolutely first rate, I agree with the other reviewer who says you'd wish the author would write a lot more books. He really has a knack of making it look easy.<br />If you are not very advanced then you will certainly spend your time very productively with this book, and it's modestly priced.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is sooooooooooooooo awesome. you get to build and hunt and soooo many other things.I am sooooooooo addicted to this game.  ;)
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Note: This is my first review that I've done, it's based solely on my own opinion of the book. Each to their own opinion.<br /><br />I must say that I was disappointed in Fifty Shades and in order for me make up my own own opinion/review I decided to read the entire book. To be honest, the book did not obsess, possess or stay with me and I understand that this was a first novel by E. L. James.<br /><br />For someone who is an avid reader, I found the plot hard to follow, mainly due to the amount of SEX in it. I love a \\"good romance\\" but it was difficult to actually get in it because I spent most thinking \\"Get on with it.\\" I'll admit that at the beginning it had the makings of a good leisurely read.<br />I was also not sure about the connection to Tom Hardy's Tess of the D'Ubervilles even though I've read the book and watched to TV series on ABC.<br /><br />On an other point, it was repetitive. The \\"biting lip\\", Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" and her continuous eye rolling (ironically I was rolling my own eyes) had started to irritate me among many other things throughout the novel.<br /><br />And Ana herself; let's just say I draw the line between common sense and love (even if it makes people do silly things). Put it this way, Ana wasn't strong enough for me enjoy reading.<br /><br />I didn't really care much for Christian's character. He's not what you would call a \\"typical romance hero\\" but more of an anti-hero. I've read quite alot of books with an anti-hero type love interest in it and Christian is not on my list (Not bad boy enough for me.)<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey had reminded me a bit too much of Twilight but with an \\"erotic\\" twist. The Ana/Christian relationship was similiar to that of Edward/Bella and there were many (and I mean many) times that I was either shaking my head thinking \\"WTF?!\\" or having facepalm moments. To me I felt that their relationship/romance was almost based purely on sex.<br /><br />Admittedly, I love good steamy sex scenes in books butI also enjoy the sexual tension and the lead up to one (In fact many of my are favourite are in Sandra Brown, Sookie Stackhouse Series and Diana Palmer). In this case, I thought lacking.<br />Too much sex in a \\"romance\\" can be really uninteresting.
0872860175|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I wrote a small review here:  [...]    The book is a compound of marvellous poems written by one of my favourite Beat Generation writers.
0099472252|3.0|Alice Munro is widely recognised for her short storiy writing, but although these were obviously well written, I felt they lacked in satisfaction. This genre doesn't provide for as much character detail and so I tend to expect some sort of reward at the end of any given story. Many of these failed to provide that, leaving me wondering why I'd read them at all.<br /><br />There is a theme running through, not just of people running away from something, but also of the effects of various changes on the course of the characters' lives - a kind of a 'what if' element.<br />No one seems to be particularly happy, this is not an uplifting collection.<br /><br />My favourites from the collection were the triplet of linked stories, Chance, Soon and Silence, here we were able to get into a bit more depth, though, again, the ending was frustrating.<br />But in terms of a complete and rounded story my vote would go to Passion because I felt that this one actually had an ending.<br /><br />My first attempt to read Ms Munro resulted in my abandoning the book (The Love of a Good Woman), so this was an improvement, but I think I will give away my copy of 'Selected Stories', this author is not for me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|super fun and a good challenge. this game had me hookedbfrom the first time i played it i love it
B0052U59F4|5.0|Awesome book.  I haven't enjoyed reading an adult book in many years (mostly read children's books to little ones). When I picked up this first book I instantly (well around chapter 5) became hooked.  I've recommended it to several friends and they all agree... this is a fantastic series that you won't be able to put down or stop talking about.  A real PRETTY Woman type of love story!
B0055SWM08|5.0|simple fun and challenging.  good game.  nice visually.  sounds are good. runs well on kindle fire.  smooth interface with well thought out puzzles and layout.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Very relaxing.  I highly recommend this for some quick puzzle action.  The design is simple and the controls are natural and responsive.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It took a while for me to finish the book, I felt that the beginning started out a little slow and it picked up more in the middle. Great writing by the author though I wish she would have added more to each character! Once I had finished I felt really emotional, upset on how the ending was written, but other than that I really enjoyed most of the book.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is a nice one to wile away the hours with. its simple and easy to pick up while being stimulating enough to keep you playing.  Not a perfect game by any means but far better than most of the apps out there.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I can not take my eyes of this games it is so adicting. will you please make onehundred more please!
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Very difficult to read simply because many of the descriptive words were in Swedish and just made tracking the story very difficult.  Maybe a good movie but a lousy book.
0062101897|5.0|amazing book! feel like i checked it out of the library of Hogwarts. i only wish they included more about HEDWIG!! like wtf? there was literally nothing on her! other than that it was an amazing read! might've taken a while to read...but deffinately worth it ! the boy who lived lives forever!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lots of logical fun. it's a good value at 99 cents. I look forward to seeing how the levels progress.  I really like the look of it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|this game is really fun but my kindle freezes often and needs to be reset. and it changes the times randomly on some collections from 3 minutes to 59 hours. please fix bugs also its a tad annoying to have to wait 3 minutes for energy 1 or 2 minutes would be better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game as a time waster or when I am bored. I love that it is free and I can take it anywhere.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I have purchased a lot of apps for my Kindle, and have deleted a lot of apps.  Hands down, this is the best app yet by far.  It is so addicting.  I feel like I'm a kid again playing Super Mario ... only this is better.  And it's free!!  It's a no brainer ... get it!
B007MJSQSK|5.0|Having read many of the books as a kid, I was a bit nervous that they would mess up a good thing. I was amazed at what a great job was done in the animation, and the tone and flavor of the books really stood true. I was so happy to see a great live adventure from the Tin-tin books.
1401937519|3.0|While I am impressed with the story it's a bit slow moving for me. Hopefully it will pick up as I move along.
B0000669JL|5.0|My wife and I went to Jamaica 2 months ago and we just fell in love with it. We listened to this this music everyday, all day. Everytime we start missing it, we just play a little Bob Marley and everything comes right back. Everything gonna be alright mon.
B001I0T92Q|1.0|I bought this item to combine with 2 32GB microSD cards to make a 64GB PSP.  I got a \\"failed to format\\" error on PSP.  Thinking quickly, I used my black MicroSDHC to Memory Stick Pro Duo adapter and the PSP formatted successfully to 64GB!  Yay!  Looks like I got some bad luck with the reviewed product.  I'll try to get a refund or exchange later but for now 1 star is my initial impression.
0345803485|5.0|I COULD NOT PUT THIS DOWN, my eyes hurt and I could not do anything else but finish this book.  Riveting, sexual, funny in spots where I found myself laughing out loud.  I am on book two and I know I will feel awful when I get to the end of the trilogy.  This is an intense, electrifying and informative book. I certainly learned a thing or too!  Kudos to E.L. James, what an imagination, would love to have her at my next dinner party!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great story line.  Was enjoyable to read a story about a dog's thoughts and his looking forward to becoming a human.  Touching, sometimes sad, but always enjoyable to read.
B002WTC92E|5.0|I loved this book!  I found it entertaining and some what true to life.  It was a fun easy read. I shared it will all of my late 20's girlfriends.  We all enjoyed it.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|I haven't read the book.  I haven't seen the old BBC version.  I hadn't read any reviews.  Other than knowing something vague about the type of books by the original author and the fact that Gary Oldman was supposed to be quite good in it, I knew nothing before watching this film.<br /><br />The first thing is: this is a very cerebral film.  If you're looking for a James Bond or Mission Impossible style spy movie, skip this one.  There's very little action, and very little of the \\"thriller\\" quality.  It seems many of the bad reviews come from people who went in with the wrong expectations.  If you're not the sort of person who likes to go to the \\"art house\\" cinemas and watch long introspective movies, there's really little point in watching this one.  You're probably going to be bored or confused or both.<br /><br />At its heart, this film is a rather subdued mystery, which just happens to involve spies.  However, the power of the film is mostly in its portrayal of characters and their qualities -- it is a meditation on issues like honesty, power, loyalty, friendship, and the like.  These issues are played out among a group of men who are paid to be quiet and stealthy, so don't expect a lot of chit-chat or overt excitement.  Instead, there are many moments of tension and revelation (with great acting) as these things are sorted out.<br /><br />The film opens with the idea that there's a rumor about the possibility of a double-agent at the very top of British intelligence.  An agent who was forced into retirement is called back by the supervising minister's office to investigate.  The likely candidates for the \\"mole\\" are gradually revealed and eventually explicitly identified with nicknames like \\"Tinker, Tailor,\\" etc., hence the name of the film.<br /><br />Many have complained that there is too much crammed into the plot, that the flashbacks were confusing, that it's difficult to follow, etc.  I will grant that this is not a movie where you can get up and go make asandwich and come back assuming you'll just figure it out.  Every gesture -- a nod, a glance, a raised eyebrow, a shoulder shrug -- often carries layers of meaning.  The acting and directing throughout is genuinely superb in that respect.  This is the kind of film where the way a character reacts to an errant bee (by swatting it or by opening a window to let it out) substitutes for 5 minutes of dialogue establishing the personality of the characters.<br /><br />Even knowing nothing coming in, you quickly realize that you need to pay attention -- there are just too many faces and characters to keep track of.  And once you figure out the game, it's not too hard to follow.  The flashbacks are relatively obvious, since in almost all of them the original boss, called \\"Control\\" (played by John Hurt) is alive, even though he died in the opening credits.  Almost all other flashbacks are clearly framed by some character in the present indicating that he is telling a story.<br /><br />In general, the screenplay is incredibly \\"tight,\\" with all those little details of dialogue and expressions and gestures giving you plenty of information about the characters and their situations without being overt.  Gary Oldman is at the center of this all, managing to tell us a lot about himself without saying a word for the first 15 minutes of the film.<br /><br />I have only one complaint regarding character development, and it is difficult to voice this without giving too much away.  Basically, the one place where the writers clearly don't give us enough character information (or even perhaps enough for viewers to keep track of who is who) is among some of the characters under suspicion for being the mole.  This is a critical oversight, since any viewer who knows the conventions of films will realize that the solution to the mystery of the plot must lie with some characters we actually know something about.  It would be a terrible ending to suddenly turn to a random guy who had one line inthe rest of the film (and whom the audience doesn't even remember) and say, \\"Yes, it was he -- the butler did it!  Obviously!\\"<br /><br />In other words, we pretty quickly come to realize that a few of the \\"suspects\\" are out of the running, just because we can't even remember what they look like, let alone what they might have implied about themselves in the two lines of dialogue they had.  This is a huge oversight for the writers which I assume does not happen in the book.  Instead of a mystery centered on five specific men, the viewer is forced early on to cast around for other possible culprits -- maybe the mole is someone else, maybe the primary investigator is a mole, maybe someone working with him is, maybe there is no mole at all -- and many of these speculations immediately strike the viewer as red herrings at best.<br /><br />I watched the film twice because I realized how much subtlety went into the writing, directing, acting, cinematography, etc., and also to find out what I missed.  On a second viewing, my initial sense was confirmed: I still don't know ANYTHING about one of the guys who is supposed to be a prime suspect, and another one we don't know anything about until the mystery really starts to unravel.  It's kind of hard to take either of them seriously as suspects when they are pretty much ignored by the movie.<br /><br />And for that reason, despite all of the film's great strengths, I think it fails as a mystery.  There's a good chance an astute viewer could guess something like the ending within the first quarter of the film.  For that reason, I think the writers failed to compress the plot of the book successfully (since I assume the book is not this obvious).  Yet I still watched it twice because the film really isn't about the mystery.  It's about the dynamics between all these characters and the subtlety of their relationships.<br /><br />In the opening scene, the Control character talks about interrogating a suspected defector in searchof \\"treasure,\\" by which he means secret information of great value.  In a way, this film also has \\"treasure\\": the secrets of these secretive men are gradually revealed in a subtle -- but intriguing and intelligent -- way.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think Lep's World is very fun and entertaining. It's like a St. Pattie's version of Super Mario Bros :-)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Calming but thought provoking game.  I find I can while away an hour before I know it. Can be very habit forming. This is one of my favorite apps. Would be interesting to any age group.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game has taken way too much of my productive time--can't stop playing it.  It is fun and challenging, but watch out--it is addicting!
0345803485|5.0|This trilogy was very interesting I read the entire thing in a week. It was unable to put the book down.  They had constant changes.  Definitely a must read!!
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I bought this movie before reading the reviews.  Big mistake.  I heard it was so good, and Meryl Streep always is, but not in this kind of film.  I watched for the first 20 minutes, maybe less, and came to the computer to read the reviews.  Was it me?  At first I couldn't figure out what was going on, but after a short while I realized they were doing re-runs of her life through a woman aging with dementia.  My mother suffered from Alzheimer's and I didn't want to watch it all over again.  It's a horror.  I will not watch the rest of this film. After reading the reviews, I realized that many other reviews were not good, and though it's Meryl Streep, and she's a great actress, it didn't help. I've recently purchased two DVD's with her in it,Julie and Julia and The Devil Wears Prada, I loved them both. Watched them many times.  She's great in both. The films are uplifting and enjoyable.  We all have enough of our own problems to watch something as awful as this. I hated Doubt as well, but at least I could watch it.  I guess I'm not interested in horror films.  That was what this film seemed to be moving into. Well, that's all I have to write.  I will probably never watch the rest, but I don't think I'll be missing anything.  Why didn't they make a film about the high points of her life and career? That's what I thought it would be.  Who knows?  Good advice.  Read these reviews before you purchase any films.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time for android.. I was so happy to see it was the free app of the day

B005KP7EK4|4.0|Great story. Excellent acting. Beautiful cinematography. Not sure how I missed this when it first came out.  Paul Newman would be happy with Sam Shepard's depiction of Butch Cassidy for sure.  Definitely recommend.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I loved it. The game was engaging and fun. My brothers friend even likes it. Please make even more games like it.

B000003CUJ|5.0|Very exciting and dymanic.  The recording was excellent and I am pleased with this purchase.  I recommend this to anyone who likes Wagner but without the voices.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a truly imaginative and captivating story. It is thoughtful, well written, and features characters with depth. If you want a great page-turner with interesting characters and a lot of action, this is it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Children of the '90s who grew up playing Oregon Trail will love this game. Its similar to Pioneerville and those Facebook games.

B004I744AS|4.0|great when you need a dictionary on the go and fun to use.<br />it has pictures showing the word and good minigames
0786939532|5.0|This is a wonderful beginning to the trilogy prequel of the Legend of Drizzt Do-Urden - I love how this characters development and understanding of his people and of his abilities is not given some sort of quick over taking, but a detailed excursion into what will make the Drow Anti-Hero that character that we will grow to love - my hat off to you Mr Salvatore - you have done great by me with this one.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|the game is fun but energy takes to long an u cant add friends or it freezes when u go to other peoples fafm or corces shut down

0345525558|5.0|Having just read The Kid, my whole outlook on the foster care system was pretty negative/pessimistic. And my brain was like CAN'T handle another tragic story about a kid no one cares about. Diffenbaugh even said something along the lines of the narrator will break your heart. I was like UGH AGAIN?? To quote Feist, \\"too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for you.\\"<br /><br />Despite hoping to avoid a state of bookish depression, I am perpetually drawn to books that will make me feel a deep range of emotions and The Language of Flowers promised to do just that.<br /><br />The story begins with Victoria, a foster child, who is 18 and finally old enough to leave the group home where she has lived the last few years of her life. As a child, Victoria bounced around from home to home where she was abused, forgotten, and forever unloved. This constant state of emotional upheaval turned her into a harden young woman, violent and cruel.<br /><br />The closest Victoria ever got to being adopted was when she was 9 years old. Elizabeth, a young woman who lives alone in the country with a dark and painful history of her own, took her in and the two grew to love each other through their mutual affinity for The Language of Flowers*, but something terrible happens and the two are torn apart. And Victoria is just swimming in guilt.<br /><br />Victoria gets a job and becomes involved with a man who is connected to Elizabeth (as a way to stay close to E??). However, Victoria can't seem to feel for him what he feels for her. Her emotions are stunted-or at least so deeply buried as to appear stunted-by years of neglect and the guilt and shame that comes with it.When she gets preggo she flees the scene without a word.<br /><br />This is the point in the story that I was like FINALLY she is going to get those motherly hormones and start realizing that her life could be so much more than what it has been up to this point. BUT NO. Of course she screws it up (what kind of story wouldit be if she didnt?!), because she feels like everything she loves or touches she ruins. And you're conflicted, hating her and sympathizing with her, wanting her to grow-up, and contemplating the ripple effect of one seriously effed up system.<br /><br />The back and forth from present time to past is a great juggling act on the part of Ms. Diffenbaugh. You don't know what the awful thing that tore the women apart was until near the end of the story-and you're just dying to know the whole time. I was so engrossed that I read this story in ONE day. Also, don't worry the ending is nothing like The Kid. It's actually conclusive and beautiful and not too oh-everything-is-going-to-be-perfect
B000GG4Y32|5.0|Extraordinary people living in historic times. Just a suggestion, if you loved this film you will also love Dr. Bethune with Donald Sutherland. Unfortunately only available in vhs apparently.
0345803485|5.0|took 2 days for me to read this front to back- i hadnt bought the trilogy all at once even though my gut told me too...now im waiting for the other 2 anxiously...in total, the book has worked its way around our whole salon in less than 10 days..
B004CR5TD0|2.0|Many people hyped this as one of the best albums last year? What sort of fool-aid were those people drinking? I got sucked into buying this based on the reviews; further proof that I need to start listening to song samples first before I buy. In any case, I don't hear anything remotely moving or melodic or danceable on this album. Dubstep? If that's what tickles your fancy, go for it, but it ain't working for me. I read about comparisons to xx and Bon Iver, and I don't hear any of that whatsoever. What I do hear is some geek piddling away on his laptop, producing self-indulent \\"sound-scapes\\" that barely qualify as songs.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|i would of gave it a 5 but the energy gainig time takes a little to long for an android game
B0040NOWY8|3.0|Two out of twenty discs failed, for a ten percent failure rate, which is pretty high for an expensive product.  The discs that were successful are excellent and the price was the best I could find anywhere.
B0073PZN8O|2.0|I bought this movie. Turned it on and began to watch. I woke up hours later. Some times I have trouble falling asleep. This movie would be just the ticket. It is a very effective somnoriffic. (Is that a word?)
B000094Q3I|3.0|I was torn between giving this 3 or 4 stars, but opted for the lower rating simply because this particular album didn't impress me as much as later recordings by Terry Callier. I know I'll get slammed for the rating by those that think this is a masterpiece, but let me try and justify it. This album was recorded back in 1965 and the production is bare-bones minimum; just Callier's voice and guitar, accompanied by a bass player. The material is almost all \\"traditional\\" folk songs, yet there is a definite jazz bent to the interplay between the guitar and bass. And Callier's achingly lonesome vocals add a blues vibe to a few tunes as well. But even Callier's arresting vocals can't quite lift some of this drab material of its turgid pedestal. Again, I hate to sound harsh, but the material on this album is just too somber, and too samey sounding compared to what you'll hear on other Callier LPs. And maybe that's the problem: I started with later Callier recordings from the 70s and worked my way backwards. I loved albums like \\"What Color is Love\\" and \\"Occasional Rain,\\" and even thought \\"Fire and Ice\\" was quite good. But the songs on this debut are sleepy and subdued by comparison. There is no denying the power of this man's voice. That alone, makes this worth listening to, but I don't think it would be the best introduction for a new listener wanting to hear what Callier is all about.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are pretty fun and unique. the only thing I have to complain about is how many points you need to unlock the games. it takes forever just to unlock one new game, its ridiculous.
B006N0MLJO|5.0|This is a great construction calculator app.  I first bought it for the Ipod but I don't carry my Ipod that much so I bought it for my phone.  I've paid a lot of money for construction calculators in the past but not no more.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I am really glad that I purchased this DVD.  All of the acting is top quality and the local Hawaiian scenery is beautiful.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game lots to do just wish u didn't run out of energy so fast other than that its a great game lots of fun A+++++++++
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|As I really enjoyed this character in Shrek I decided to give this flic a try. Was pleasantly suprized due to some of the neg reviews I expected less. It was funny as (meow), really enjoyed the story line as well as the interesting female lead. This is a great movie for family fare and well worth the price of rental!
B005IF5H2S|5.0|Love love love the CD. Great new songs and some of my favorites. Definite must have CD Download time was fast and easy
B000VH4OCW|5.0|If you ever buy one CD, well actually 2 CD's, this should be it. This double set is Stevie Wonder at his best, what you have here are some great and catchy songs. Some duets with artists like Michael Jackson.<br />I had originally bought this years ago when it came out on vinyl, I eventually wore it out, as I did most LP's. Nice to know you can now have it last forever and never wear it out. Highly recommended!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|its nice that my kids play thinking games instead of other games so this is the perfect game the 99 cent app is great
B0071MV540|2.0|It was an ok movie to watch it once. Has too many adult refrences. Not as funny as the previews had let on.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have never played this game, but I have 6 grandkids that do!  I got the Kindle Fire for my Bday and got this, it is  BLAST!<br />I can see why the addictions!! ahhahaha
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is the first time I've ever felt the need to write an Amazon review in my life, and since Amazon helped me find Ready Player One late last night, I figured I'd add my opinion to the big stack of reviews that helped me choose it.<br /><br />I just finished reading this book in one sitting. I've never done that before. I got to this cafe sometime this morning, bought an iced coffee for two bucks, sat down and began to read, and 8 hours later with a sigh I locked my Kindle's screen, whipped out my laptop, and here we are. I have no idea why the staff in this cafe haven't kicked me out yet: I haven't ordered anything else since that iced coffee BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT DISENGAGING MYSELF FOR A MOMENT FROM THE LITERARY MULTIPLE ORGASM THAT ERNEST CLINE HAS LOVINGLY COAXED OUT OF WORDS.<br /><br />I didn't want to do that. I do not ALLCAPS lightly. I am enthused.<br />I LOVE THIS BOOK. There I go again.<br /><br />I read people comparing this book to Snow Crash, and it has that same action-packed geeky urgent awesomeness, and I love that book, but I love Ready Player One better.<br /><br />It feels like this book is the reward I've earned for a youth spent geeky. Even though I missed the 80s completely, I've played many of the games mentioned (even the text adventures), seen the movies, and watched the television shows, so I can relate a lot with the main character and the subject matter. It was like reading a fantasy made directly for me, and it was profoundly, incredibly enjoyable.<br /><br />I don't know if you'd like it if you weren't an uber dork like me. I don't care. I feel light headed and happy and very satisfied and like I'm just emerging from the total immersion video game from the book into the real world here in the cafe.<br /><br />I notice that I haven't talked too much about the book itself, but hopefully my reaction to it has given you some indication of what to expect. I think you'll love it. I think my friends will love it, and I'm going to gotell them now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love, love, love the hunger games trilogy. I don't read all the time, but had to read the 3 hunger games books. You will not be dissapointed!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|really fun and addictive game. good way to pass time. my great nephew really has a brad time putting it down.
1594203334|5.0|This book is great for parents who believe that a new baby/child becomes a part of your family, not for parents who think their new baby should rule their world!  A light, easy to read narrative with chapters organized around subject matter (pregnancy, daycare, etc.), this book had great anecdotal stories and figures and statistics (with notes to back them up).  I especially enjoyed the sections on how French parents allow their babies to cry a little bit (\\"the Pause\\")before picking them up to teach them patience, how babies sleep through the night, and how the eating habits of French kiddos.  A lot of fun to read and gave me several good ideas for how I want to raise my own bebes!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|loved this game back in school and love it even more....great on kindle fire just wish my energy would go up faster
B007LB1O3I|5.0|Great album with songs that have so much potential. Masterpiece and Falling Free are the only non-dance songs but they are GREAT. Worth it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Did not know that there were books to go along with the movie and when I heard there was a trilogy of books on the Hunger Games of course I had to read them! Enjoyed the book and couldn't wait to get the second one! It was an escape book, one you could just read quickly and be lost in it! Would recommend it to people who love to read different kinds of books!
B0045I3EJC|5.0|This Movie Is SUPER AWESOME!!!<br />I Recommend It To Anyone...<br />I Can Watch It As Many Times As I Can And It'll Be Like If It Was The First Time I Watch It...<br />I Love It... :D
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. yes its easy but that is part of the beauty. my son enjoys it too.
B00138GZAC|4.0|The best of sade all rolled up into one album. If you enjoy a good jazzy and soulful voice you'll enjoy this album by sade.
0345803485|5.0|After reading all the hype on the trilogy, I decided to read Fifty Shades of Grey.  And I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the story.  I know that the writing is juvenile at times, and I definitely could do without the goddess and subconscious, but I looked past this to the underlying story.  I love romance and that's what this is.  Every woman wants to be cherished, to win a man over, to convert a bad boy, and ultimately, Anastasia saves Christian.  Although developed as fan fiction from Twilight, at least Anastasia has the common sense to enjoy Christian's money and lifestyle, unlike the paranoid Bella who wouldn't even accept a birthday present.  The sex scenes were written with an extreme amount of detail and I have to wonder about a man with that much stamina.  Maybe a little unrealistic?  But even what is described as kinky still remains within the acceptable in today's society.  The continuity of the story was great - the characters followed the prescribed personality traits and except for a few small details, all storylines were wrapped up by the end of book 3.  For those of you who are wondering what was left dangling (no pun intended), remember Taylor and the red lipstick.  Could be something - could be nothing.  The progression of the story from book 1 to book 2 was surprising but satisfying.  If Ms. James could learn not to overuse esoteric words and edit the book closer (my Kindle edition had many errors), I think she will be extremely successful in the future.
B00004RJ71|3.0|This movie is an education. It's 3 whole hours long, but you'll learn a lot about people you'd otherwise never want to spend any time with.  Yeah, the lead characters are not very likeable, but they're for real. I would have given this movie 4 stars, except for the bad acting at the top. I don't understand why Damian Chapa was cast at all?  Chapa makes Charlie Sheen look like Al Pacino.  Honestly, Damian Chapa belongs only in B movies. Jesse Borrega has some inner life, but he jumps around slapping his chest, yapping and shrieking like he's in some brown-face minstrel show! Only Benjamin Bratt is half decent, although he's forced to overact by his leaping, prancing, and shouting co-stars. Billy Bob Thornton does a great little bit of scene stealing as a San Quentin AB cracker with almost no dialogue at all.  And Delroy Lindo is also excellent as the leader of the black gang. There is something wrong with a movie about Chicano gang and prison culture when the best and funniest performances come only from the blacks and whites in the cast. Just sayin'.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is rather fun and addictive. I would seriously recommend it. It gets me through my work day with ease.
B000SX89TS|4.0|I enjoyed this album for many reasons because it offers resonating mellow sounds combined with an upbeat tempo. Great to listen to in the car while driving or just at home to relax.
B0076303RY|5.0|Hooks you in and keeps you engaged for the duration of the entire season.  Can't wait for more! I highly recommend it for anyone who loves England and the time period before and after WW1 and WWWII.
B00486070K|5.0|If you have a Macbook Air and experience wireless networking issues, then this is for you. Just plug in and you have a rock-steady connection. To the people complaining that this is not 1000Mb/s - you might want to just get a Macbook Pro if you really need this kind of throughput. Or, get an (as of yet unreleased) Thunderbolt adapter or Thunderbolt monitor with its port expansion capabilities.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I played this game and it good for free it reminds me of super Mario brothers. try it and you love it! &lt;3

B00782O7IY|5.0|Surprisingly, 2011 revealed many great films...The Devil's Double,  Harry Potter, Midnight in Paris, Hugo, The Adventures of Tin Tin and THE ARTIST.  All of these are fine and unusual films.  Dominic Cooper was exceptional in The Devil's Double.<br /><br />THE ARTIST is the best.  It is a beautiful, perfect film.  Educated and sophisticated filmgoers will recognize this.  The performances are flawless; the two leads are brilliant--great, compassionate, subtle performances.  I went to see this twice in the theatre, and the audiences at both showings applauded.  This film deserved every award it received...and more!  It also should have won for best actress.<br /><br />Some people do not understand what art is.  Movies that play out like rehashed made for TV movies, sappy romances, or movies with tons of sfx or<br />various car crashes--these are what many people want to see when they go to the movies.  Just look at the box office totals for most of the very financially successful movies--they are not art.<br /><br />The Artist is what many people have been waiting for...a wonderful story, authentic looking, the best acting/writing/story/music...and did I mention Uggie the dog?<br /><br />Applause and praise to everyone involved in this wonderful film...and especially to the studio who released it!
0345803485|5.0|I absolutley loved this trilogy. I was so sad when I was getting close to the end of this love story. I enjoyed it not knowing how I might feel about the whole S&M part of it but it turned into more of a love story with great sex and I completly enjoyed it. Read all 3 books within 2 weeks, and I cant wait til this author comes out with her next book.
1576875776|5.0|I must be missing something. I absolutely love this book. I have no beef with blank pages or the print quality.<br /><br />Ms. Maier had a phenomenal eye and an incredible knack for capturing compelling people and amazing street scenes.<br />I found the book a delight from cover to cover, and overall, a quality collection well worth the price.<br /><br />I thought the tones were lush, with deep shadows and rich highlights. Yes, some shots more than others. But nothing beyond the normal range of print tones I would expect to see. I have enjoyed paging through this title again and again and yet I still find myself delightfully discovering new details, again and again. That seems a good sign to me and well worth the money in my opinion.<br /><br />Use the \\"Look Inside\\" link and judge for yourself, that should give you some idea what to expect.<br />Then do yourself a favor.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|One of the best audio purchases I've ever made!  This little bugger makes even lousy headphones sound great. Now I can pump up the volume late at night and not disturb anyone else.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|really fun awesome it could have better graphix challenging I love the game<br /> cool. fun really game I'm in love you should try it
B005PK1G76|5.0|These are great but they don't work with the Baby Jogger City Mini GT double. They work great with the regular city mini, you can use 2 and have tons of storage and cup holders. They do work with the single city mini GT.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its a really fun game the only problem is that their isn't a lot of things to buy but other then that I would recommend it
B0073XORCY|1.0|I pre ordered this CD with great anticipation only to be so disappointed upon the arrival and eventual four listenings. I though,well I haven't really given it a chance to sink in yet or I'm not in the right frame of mind to actually hear the songs, music and receive it as intended. BUT now after four times of actually listening, I can only say, Why release this CD? Thick As A Brick by Jethro Tull is one of the all time greats while TAAB-2 is one of the all time great disappointments.<br /> While all who play on it are talented musicians, it doesn't get close to the sound or power of Jethro Tull nor the interesting weave of story and song dynamics.<br /> It starts with fantastic interest fading in from where Thick As a Brick left off making you think wow, how cleaver, the story continues and yes the first song draws you in because of that great intro and then it's all down hill from there on and boring.<br /> The guitarist while a good player and talented in his style but not anything close to the style, technique, power or drive of Barre or the Tull sound we all love. There is no power to this album, no drive and zero excitement......yes Tull did soft tunes as well but this is like a bad play tune one after another.<br /> Although I'm 65 now I still listen to rock every day and still play bass and guitar and love the Power and Dynamics Of Jethro Tull(The Band That Is). I guess some stories should end where they did originally, Great.<br /> Thick As A Brick was so great and TAAB-2 is really So Bad. Save your money and buy a ticket to San Francisco on Translove Airways they'll get you there on time or re-buy all of Tulls original recordings....just avoid TAAB-2 at all cost. Bland blah and boring.....I only gave it One Star because of effort and Andersons voice is still excellent for his age. Sadly you can't leave a negative star rating or I might have rated it -5 Stars.......so so sad......I'll save the jewel case and pitch the rest....It might have actually been palatable if it wasn't wrongfully titled Thick As A Brick 2...possibly Titled \\"Ian Anderson Sings While Boring Band Plays\\" would have been more appropriate...! Waste of good money and of studio time...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is hands down the best Bible study tool ever. I recommend this app to everyone I come across.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I don't like this app only because of how long it takes to get energy if it only took two minuites I would be happy
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is a good pass time and usefull for those who can check it frequently.  the over all app is fun but the game is mindless with no real point.
0345803485|5.0|I first heard about this book a few weeks ago from a group at dinner. I knew some of the details but not much and I am glad I didn't know too much before reading it.<br />The relationship between Anna and Christian is what makes the book although other characters are in it and add to it. Anna is a sweet and uncomplicated virgin who meets Christian, a billionaire, and a Greek God in her eyes. He is into bondage and wants Anna to sign a contract and submit to him. How they meet and what happens IS THE STORY.  I loved the sub thoughts in Anna's mind as well as their e-mails back and forth to each other.<br />Some of the acts Christian performs is disturbing since I am not into bondage, but I found it fascinating. You know Christian has many problems and we all know this will come out why in the next two books.  While this book is not for everyone, I loved it and now my husband is reading it. I have no idea what he will think!<br />This is addictive reading and I could not put it down and finished it before a male friend had finished his Kindle. What does this say??
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game for the money. not hard to get $ so the levels are not impossible to unlock. I would recommend. this game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really like that it doesn't need wifi to play so I'm occupied everywhere.there really isn't anything wrong with it
B003XQ2VOG|4.0|This set is a bargain for sci-fi and sfx movie fans.<br />The Lost World, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,<br />and Fantastic Voyage are sci-fi classics and hold up<br />pretty well with age. The Towering Inferno does look<br />a little out of place compare with other three.<br />And the sets and clothes do look a bit dated also,<br />but the movie is still fun to watch with all<br />the \\"old movie stars\\" doing their thing. I sort<br />of remember this Irwin Allen movie being the start<br />of the trend of disaster movies that had big special<br />effects with a large cast of old movie stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have never played a better solitaire game. I would suggest every one to get this game.<br />5out of 5
0439023513|1.0|I absolutely loved Hunger Games and Catching Fire, so I had the same high expectations for Mockingjay. Without spoiling anything, I will just say that the author's goal of presenting war as a horrible thing totally ruined the entertainment aspect of it for me. I know war can't be all blue skies and rainbows, but I mean, come on really? The characters are completely different in this book and the ending is just really a disappointment. I was reading this series for entertainment, not so I would want to go kill myself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've read many reviews of these books and everyone has to analyze everything.  I can see analyzing the books for a class or a paper, but why not just sit back and enjoy reading a good series.  If you don't like the books, just say you didn't like it.  I enjoyed the books very much and have already read them a second time in a month's time. I will definitely read the series many times over.  Noone's perfect and Suzanne Collins is just trying to give us a series of interesting books and apparently she has, because the series is one of the most read books in the last couple of years.  Sit back and just enjoy...life is too short to analyze everything.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This app was so much fun until it started crashing every time I tried to make a combo. As several other reviewers have mentioned this starts to happen once you have about 30 combos or so. I would love to keep playing but I can't.
B0055SWM08|5.0|We all love playing this game!  My 8 and 6 year old really enjoy it as well.  A nice change from chess.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Yeah. I went there. Definitely one of my favourite style of puzzle games, and I'll admit that I actually find myself wanting to fulfill all of the achievements.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|really fun. reminds me of Mario. one of those games that you love to hate once you get to a point and get stuck but you keep playing anyway.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read for all audiences!  Very intensive too; you never want to put the book down.  My only complaint is the occasional gap in time without explanation from the author.  Since I'm a very detail-oriented person, this was sometimes aggravating, but yet also seemed to \\"close things out\\" in the end.
B004SBX112|5.0|Just another good Angry Birds game with adorable seasonal themes.  Very clever and challenging game.  These RIO people are AWESOME!!! My G-kids love to play them on my Kindle Fire.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I ended up really liking this series.  There is the look of \\"The World is absurd, and I am quietly laughing\\" often on the heroine's face, and you get a much better feel of the characters as the people that Jane Austen was laughing at.  Because it is a series, they added so many of the little details that make it feel right.  Even the size of the \\"balls\\", which were much smaller than what people raised on modern wedding receptions in vast spaces often think of, made me enjoy the little details.<br />I ended up doing things like really looking at the costuming - I had not realized that having the tops and bottoms not match was part of the style.<br />So even though I own more than one movie, I like this so much better!
B004LWZW7O|4.0|Smooth Si-Fi drags a bit in the middle or it would be a five<br />Justin Timberlake could be Gen Ys. jJames Bond<br />looking forward to next movie from Andrew Nicccol
B003O86FMW|4.0|Another great book in the Hunger Games series!  Again, very intensive action - but the occasional gaps in time from the author left me wanting answers.  Also, did not like the way the book ended.  While I enjoy the idea that there is one more book to end the series, the spot where the book leaves off is unsatisfying.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have yet to find an Angry Birds game I don't like....<br />My Granddaughter and pseudo-grandchildren love to play these games on my Kindle Fire.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|A movie that had lots of potential, but somehow went wrong.  Looking at the reviews, I thought this was going to be another good movie that gets nothing but troll reviews saying how bad it was, when in reality it's an awesome movie.  This time, I was wrong.  The first twenty minutes are okay, especially right after people start dieing.  Then, everything gets boring.  There's a couple interesting scenes, and the special effects are really good, but it's just not a movie I could see anyone really getting into.  I'm not going to call this the worst move ever, but I will say it's not worth buying, or watching more than once.  If you wish to see this, rent it first.  I watched the whole movie and just could not enjoy it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awesome its like Mario but with a leprechaun it has the best graphics it makes me so happy making this review onering this game .
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book was a good read, yet I felt the ending was rushed and somewhat confusing.  The jumps in time left Katniss' thought process in a \\"black hole\\" where you weren't quite sure which direction she would go.  This was disheartening because you thought you really got to know her character in the first two books and that her moves would be more predictable - it was the anticipation of how others would act that left you wanting to read more in the prior books.  That wasn't the case in this book.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I remember when I first heard Whitney sing *I Look To You* .. I was totally gobstrucked and asked my friend to start the CD from the very first song.  After hearing Whitney sing *Million Dollar Bill*, I felt she had recovered a good 95% plus of her vocals and was well on her way back to us.  A more mature Whitney, but still the Whitney I grew up with; the songs, the music and voice I loved.  I purchased the first copy of this CD in 2009.<br /><br />Many called this her comeback album.  I always felt it was her way of showing her fans that she was moving in another direction.  Sadly, we will never know what musical direction that would or could have been.  This is the second CD I have purchased, for I wanted one for driving, the other for home.<br /><br />Rest In Peace, Whitney, and thank you.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|A HILARIOUS movie that's been ravaged by troll reviews here on Amazon.  Don't listen to anyone giving this anything below 5 stars.  If you have a good sense of humor, and love a dirty comedy movie, this is a movie for you!  It's hilarious, interesting, and even suspenseful.  If you are easily offended, don't watch this, but if you like having fun and having tons of laughs, watch this today!
B0026IUXME|5.0|I am nothing more than a movie lover. Any chance I get to see a movie I'm interested in, I take, but it is not every day that I see a movie of such quality. Quality which has left me speechless as to what exactly I should say. Tonight was the first time I have ever seen this movie, though I have wanted to see it for quite some time. I do not remember the last time that a movie moved me to such tears, compassion and awe as The Pianist has. I give it five stars not only for it's incredible portrayal of the Holocaust, and the Holocaust OUTSIDE of Germany, but this moving story that happened within the Holocaust. I hope to watch this movie many more times, but I know that no matter how many times I do, I will still cry and smile, feel my heart break and rejoice at the ending all over again--EVERY time.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|an interesting Oregon trail continuation pretty addictive and runs great on kindle fire you level pretty quick and get to build up your town
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Yes, there are a number of Whitney's music videos missing from this collection, however, if you are a Whitney fan, this is a must have DVD. These videos are the same videos we watched on MTV, VH1, and other cable music stations.  The picture and sound quality are crisp and clear.  They have NOT been ripped from YouTube, which in my opinion, is a big plus.  I hope Sony/BMG will release a second DVD that will include the 3 or 4<br />that were made prior to the year 2000 that are missing from this DVD, and also include the music videos Whitney made prior to the release of her *I Look To You* album.  The Music Videos *Million Dollar Bill* and *I LooK To You* were, and are awesome.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|I love the hunger games! Be for I ever read the books I thought that the book were lame but then my sister came by and read them for a project in school. She started telling me what its about so I started to read the books and I realized that I had the wrong idea a out them so because of all that i went to see the hunger games opening time!!!!<br /><br />It was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVED IT!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I finished the first book in 6 hours, finished the 2nd book in 2 days and finished the 3rd book in 1.5 days....these were awesome books!!  I laugehd, I cried and everything in between!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Book three was very difficul to STOP reading. SIMPLY AWESOME!<br /><br />I think the movies will only get better and harder to mess up!
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I didn't really expect this to be noticeably good -- even though it was nominated for an Academy Award (Oscar). But, regardless, I gave it a try; and I'm happy I did. \\"The Descendants\\" is one of my absolute favorites of the year! The story is fresh and the acting is superb; Alexander Payne's directing is stellar! It's been a while since I've seen a film that hits all the right marks. Even though there is one small aspect to the film that was predictable, it doesn't subdue the effect of the film's message, nor does it take away from the overall excellence of the film itself. Thank goodness George Clooney chose this film after last year's disastrous [[ASIN:B002ZG993Q The American]]! And Shailene Woodley (the horrid ABC Family show [[ASIN:B005C46L3O The Secret Life of the American Teenager: Volumes 1-6]]) dazzles in her first major movie role; I can't wait to see what she does next ... even though it will probably be some dopey teenage comedy. I especially liked the fact that Clooney portrays a father who was not always emotionally present in his family's life and now he is the one to take care of his two unruly daughters, both of whom he has no idea how to raise (welcome to the club of every father with two daughters). This film takes a desperately tragic situation and injects a small dose of comedy in with a touching story of family bonding to make one of the movies you should definitely see!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a great game great for kids of all ages<br />better than most games I have on my kindle fire<br />fun for all
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I saw the movie years ago and just read the book.  It does vary from the movie as do all books/movie makes.  However this one was really good!  I liked how it followed different characters other than the movie just following the main characters.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like super Mario! I can actually play this. I recommand 4 ne one ne age to play this game
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Old school game for those like me that grew up playing Asteroids and Centipede.  Controls are easy - didn't like the firing though.
B0055SWM08|5.0|so super coolness awesome sweet marvelous and epic awesomeness never want to stop playing this game never never never never
B007P3TMW2|3.0|While this has all the aspects of a great movie, for some reason it's just not.  It's boring and slow to develop. When the story does develop it is a bit of a let down.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a great platforming game. the graphics are crisp and the characters are well drawn. Lep's jumping takes a little getting used to but its good enough. only complaint is that the collision detection sometimes says the enemy hit me when I clearly jumped on him perfectly. so, I tend to avoid the enemies...
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I bought this app several months ago for my Kindle Fire and I've loved it ever since. The objective of the game is to use a slingshot to fire birds at structures in a way that would kill the pigs. My only issues were the ads they would often pop up In the middle of the game. Apart from that it was a good app. It is free and I reccomend ditto whoever may read this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game I cant stop playing it! it is like the old school game Oregon trail but better!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game.  lots of missions.  lots of animals. best part was funny squirrel video. this is boss. if you seen movie better.  boss it up.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|this is a good twist to the angry birds story but it only came with two worlds. I mean really make all the worlds before you put it out on the market they better come up with an update
0805092919|5.0|Baby Bear is traveling back to his Mom and sees all sorts of animals along the way.  We loved the sing-song nature of the storyline.  There is a varied selection of animals that baby Bear sees along the way and wonderful pictures of them all.  The animals, colors, rhyming are a great for capturing my son's attention.  What I really like is that at the end of the story is a recap of all the animals Baby Bear saw which really reinforces the journey.  Great book!
B00004YRQA|5.0|Wow!This little memory card is really reliable. And didn't pay that much for it.I would very strongly recommend this product.
B0055SWM08|2.0|Love the game so far,  but after 5 minutes of game play my phone stuts itself off.  It looks like the battery level has dropped to zero but once i get the phone restarted its really at 87 percent. Fix and I'll re-rate.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|Meryl Streep did an amazing job in her role, amazing performance.  However, we did not like this ,movie due to the horrible writing.  This could have been such a good movie about the rise of Margret Thatcher.  Instead the primary focus was her going senile, most people will have problems as the age.  We were disappointed that the director chose to capitalize on her aging problems instead of delivering a solid story about this historical woman, I'm glad we rented this.  This is one we will never watch again.  Real disappointment.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love the Oregon Trail, now as a city building game it got even better!  Very addictive I'm finding it vet hard to put down. The best part is that its free!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am totally bewitched by this story, Fifty Shades Darker(part 2 of the Fifty Shades series) follows the relationship of Christian Grey(Fifty Shades)and Anastasia Steele as they both deal with what they want and need from their relationship while dealing with the raw sexual tension they feel. The story flows seamlessly from scene to scene as it pulls you more and more into the story. This book is Hot with lots of sexual tension, you'll worry about the characters, you cry with them, laugh then they do. Ana is begin more brave and stands up for herself. Christian is learning to actually let go some more of his problems and confides in Ana.<br /><br />I do want to address people opinion about the BDSM. I know some people can't believe people live that life style. Don't judge. I am sure there are people out there that have fantasy about sexual situations.<br /><br />DO NOT HATE THE GAME...... HATE THE PLAYER!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|nice puzzle game. works great on droid bionic. have all ready dumped a load of time into it. highly recommend this one...
B0073U2FB2|1.0|This movie is another flop.  The acting was terrible, the writing was really bad.  The entire thing was early poorly done.  We felt ripped off for the few bucks we paid to rent this.  Don't waste your time.
1400069289|4.0|Charles Duhigg has written a compelling book about habits - of people, companies, and communities - and how habits are created for better or worse.  The book is well-researched but seems to jump around a bit.  At one point it discusses personal habits and at other points it investigates how companies exploit the habits of their shoppers.  The most important thing that I took away from this book is that no matter the habit of wished improvement, if you can develop discipline in one area, it will have a halo effect upon other areas of your life.  Another scary revelation is how much companies now can extrapolate your personal life just from your shopping habits.  Buyer beware.  Don't use that debit or store credit card if you don't want them to know too much!
0345803485|5.0|I am not into BDSM stories, but I have to say that I really loved this one. This was one of those books that keeps you glued to the pages; staying up reading into the early morning. I found it to be very addicting which is really disturbing for me.<br /><br />This is the love story of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. Christian is such a complex character. You love him and hate him at the same time and it's really confusing. He's the ultimate alpha male, bad boy with a very dark and disturbing desire to inflict pain. He literally gets off on it. He meets and falls for Anastasia. When they meet she is an innocent college student and happens to still be a virgin. This is their love story and its deeply disturbing. Our boy Christian has some serious demons and its making Ana think long and hard about their relationship. This is not your typical boy meets girl let's date and fall in love romance. He wants to dominate her and he wants her submissive. He comes up with a contract that he wants her to sign. She's torn between her love for him and her fear of him. She wants to know why he is so Fifty Shades of \\"f'd\\" up. She wants to get to the bottom of what happened in his past to make him need this type of relationship and why he hates to be touched even through he was a loving family that adapt him when he was little. He introduces her to the \\"dark side\\" of his sexual habits and in his desire to keep her and make her happy, tries for the \\"vanilla relationship\\" she desires. Will Ana embrace Christian's dark side or will it be more than she can handle? The way he makes love to her is so erotic, steamy, sexy and scary all at the same time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOWZA! Can't wait to see how they make this into a movie! This book shocked me but I still had to know what happened. The second two books not so shocking but still WOWZA!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I saw this with my father while it was in theaters and I knew exactly what I was going there to see: Real active-navy seals showing us what they really do and how they are willing to sacrifice their lives at any moment to keep me and you safe at home. The acting was very good I thought. I don't know why I've heard so many people saying the acting was poor. These real navy seals in my opinion did a better job acting than many \\"trained\\" real actors do. I thought they seemed genuine, sincere and confident. All things that make an actor a \\"good\\" actor.<br /><br />I already had a reverence for those in military service for our country before seeing this film, but after, I have an much \\"deeper\\" respect for them. I left the theater with a strong sense of pride in my country. A feeling of loyalty and obligation to not just the land we live on and protect but for the \\"principles\\" those navy seals fought for. Principles like: truth, honor, justice, freedom, and mercy. I wish more movies where like Act of Valor. Without all the hollywood garbage stuffed in. Genuine acting. Genuine story-telling. This movie may have not garnered the box office attention or profit that a big budget hollywood action war movie would, but it gave us a strong taste of the goodness and values that are missing from our Entertainment today. I understand this. But I am just one person. If more people understand this then we will see more movies like Act of Valor. Movies that portray the good that all of us as human being are capable of.<br />[[ASIN:B005LAIGZU Act of Valor [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005LAIGYQ Act of Valor]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0425259358 Tom Clancy Presents: Act of Valor]]
B004EPZ03E|5.0|I feel very sad to see there are some negative feedbacks to this item on our Amazon.com.I've finish watching it just now and I have to say the story of this movie is really a little simple.No ups and downs points and no thrilling secse.But you know the movie is for the people in all age.So the producers must square up all the people in defferent age.I know people in our age(I mean the age over 18)may perfer the movie with ups and downs points and thrilling secse like \\"Mission Impossible\\" but how about the kids?Can you image a kid in 0-10 yeas watching \\"Mission Impossible\\" and say this is great?(Perhaps there will be but I'm sure it's only a few.)And on the other hand I have to say this movie has an amazing technology and the six chipmunks were created very very cutely.At the same time I think they are much cuter then them in the cartoon.(It's just my opinion.)Perhaps you guys can image how difficult the producers pruduce the chipmunks' movie.So I think we should treat the movie in different way and we should give it negative feedback.Don't you think so?Let's respect the behind-the-scenes staff together.And by the way I wish...I really wish the forth chipmunks' movie will come soon!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS BOOK 6 STARS.<br /><br />The evolution of Ana and Christian (as well as the other characters) in this book will leave a resounding effect on you. Fifty Shades Freed was a more than suitable name for this third installment in the trilogy as Christian is \\"Freed\\" from his tormented past and Ana is \\"Freed\\" from a potentially tormented future with him.<br /><br />Tears rolled and fists slammed as I flipped the virtual pages of my Kindle to continue the read. I could not put my kindle down it is a page turner.<br /><br />Christian's esoteric life finally comes to light in front of Ana and his own family, all of whom truly love him but really knew so little about him and his \\"Fifty Shades\\". Plus, he finally learns that Ana is not has fragile has he think she is. I was so happy the stuff that other men thru out her life train her went to good use. She is a kick ass wench.<br /><br />I sat completely attentive to 'Freed' as if I were trying to unravel Christian's history and mystery myself, reveling in each chapter I read.<br /><br />The Fifty Shades trilogy will make you blush, palpitate and leave you hanging on every word.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was a little skeptical when I first heard about these books, but I had to see what all the fuss was about. The first sex scene was shocking, but once I got through a few of those, I was able to see through the sex and get to the underlying story. I like both Christian & Ana, so it was easy to keep reading. While I agree with some of the other reviewers that some of the author's writing gets monotonous, I learned to overlook that. I immediately downloaded the second book and will read the third because I have to find out what makes Christian tick & what Ana can do to heal him.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|First I have to say how much I admire an everyday woman who sits down and writes her deepest darkest fantasies down and then shares them with the world!  I loved all 3 books and let me tell you why! Because it is a fictional fantasy story. It doesn't have to be true or real or whatever it took me away from my day to day life made me happy and turned on and I loved them simple as that!  I loved Ana and Christian loved the supporting characters even the creepy ones since they added to the story. I loved the writing kept my attention I read while cooking dinner while waiting at stoplights anywhere I could! Christian Grey is my fantasy all 50 shades of him and I can't wait to see who they cast to play him! Looking forward to the movie!!!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I had gotten a corsair h60 and while it worked great, it was just way too loud, even using a quiet fan on the radiator.  i'm into quiet computing so this wasn't going to cut it.  upon recommendation from the ars technica forum, i returned the h60 to fry's got a 212 and bought a quiet fan to replace the stock fan (which i did test - kinda loud.  if noise doesn't bother you, then don't worry about switching the fan, but a good quiet fan is only 10-12 bucks and since you're paying a lot less for the cooler.....anyways, the 212 performed great only registering a couple more degrees than the H60, both at idle and under load.  Also, I don't know what kind of thermal compound comes with it, but it's a zillion times easier to apply than the normal thermal compound that is out there.  I couldn't be much happier.<br /><br />The only con i can think of is that it's not exactly a snap to install.  Make sure you have lots of room and a well lit workplace.  Just seemed like they could have made the mounting bracket that the heatsink sits on attach more firmly to the heatsink.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is an amazing game and it reminds me of other games like this hope you enjoy this game bye

B000FCK8ZK|3.0|I am coming into these Dexter novels after having seen the HBO show, so I've already got an altered view of this series. I love the show and have heard great things about the novels. I can't say that I tried too hard to separate book from show, because it's hard. Jeff Lindsay has the hard task of making a serial killer into our protagonist, the hero, or anti-hero. Dexter is good and evil and book one is just barely scratching the surface. The tone was great, the pacing was pretty good, and it's interesting to be in Dexter's head. I like the side characters, though they weren't really prominent in this book since Dexter isn't really about the ancillary characters of his life. I enjoyed the story, but I wish I hadn't seen the show first because I knew what was going to happen, this book was really similar to Season 1 of Dexter. I think I'll continue with this series because I am interested to see what makes Dexter tick.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun game with tricky puzzles.  It even allows you to play over again.  Try to beat your previous score.  Definitely a must try!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|i loved this movie. antonio banderas and salma hayek are great together in this film. antonio banderas does the voice of puss in boots and salma hayek is kitty softpaws. this movie is cute and funny,a definite must see for lovers of puss in boots in the shrek movies. puss is much better in this movie. kitty softpaws is so cuddly and girly. i just loved her character. she's a bad kitty but she's got a good side to her. like puss she's also romantic and flirty.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such an enjoyable read.  Great themes of love and loyalty.  Just discovered this trilogy of books.  Never heard of it before the movie came out.  So glad I read this very entertaining series.  I highly recommend it for mature young readers and adults who like an unusual story.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Actually I'm not sure I could have given this silly, poorly written \\"erotic\\" offering a \\"no star\\" rating, but that is what it begs.  Curiosity over the media hype and the movie deal got the better of this cat, but I've only me to blame after all. Is it true that women \\"everywhere\\" are getting sexually aroused and \\"saving their marriages\\" by reading \\"Fifty Shades of Boring\\"?  One dimensional, undeveloped characters and an utterly thin, unbelievable plot (if it can be described as such) are enlivened(once)by a terrifying sadistic moment. Yep, you guessed it: our female protagonist gets spanked. OMG! What's worse is that she doesn't even like it... But she incessently consults with her \\"inner goddess\\" because she is fascinated with her 28 year old (perfect body, drop-dead handsome) billionaire boyfriend who is the \\"sadist\\". What is laughable soon turns to irritating. Ladies, at least acquire a copy of the \\"Kama Sutra\\" or visit the baths at the ruins of Pompeii to view the truly erotic pictures on those ancient walls. But before you do that, get some insight on what your sex life was like \\"before\\" you read this book, because if this stuff \\"stimulates\\" you, you might need \\"Fifty More Years\\" to reach full potential.<br /><br />R.L. Allen

B003XQM2YU|3.0|Like the reimagining of King Arthur, this film feels much more historical and authentic than all the tales about the man himself.<br />And yet it feels very well drawn out, at times, unnecessarily, still it doesn't keep it from being completely boring with needless dialogue every 2 minutes. Rather, the dialogue itself does feel true-to-time period, as well as the old-fashioned humor.<br />A man, with a fractured memory of his father, a man that goes by a name of a different structure than modern Americans are used to (part of the authenticity, when a person's name was their first name \\"of\\" place they came from) that is a brilliant strategist. On the last leg of a conquering campaign by his king, Robin  must help the king take over one last castle... except in the process the king meets his last breath. From that, Robin and a few fellow men are asked to retrieve a crown stolen from the late king. From there, many events happen to show Robin's eventual rogue renegade status as social outcast and \\"dangerous\\" rebel. In that process are several tragedies, a few funny moments, pretty deep characters, and the revelation of an arrogant church that \\"quid pro quo\\" with women, which explains why Robin doesn't hold to the Church. Nonetheless, he shows better faith in God in different ways than the Church expects of their congregations.<br />Add to the equation a highly arrogant king who downs his family relentlessly (to the point of holding his mistress with higher regard than his wife, in front of his wife) and you can see why Robin ended up having to be an outcast.<br />Well, despite the occassional lag in storytelling (and I do love movies that are over 2 1/2 hours long like Inception and Avatar), this is pretty good, all things considered. Still prefer King Arthur over this, though.
B0050AV5MW|3.0|This is kind of my first real go at reading in the fantasy genre (other than LOTR many years ago, but that hardly counts, everyone reads that...)  I was inspired by the GoT series which I really enjoyed.  The books are interesting, and the plots complex and twisted, but you know I kinda get sick of bad stuff always happening to \\"good\\" people.  There's a lot of words without the plot advancing particularly far.  I find that I'm frustrated at the end of each book, because nothing's really been achieved, there's no natural \\"end point\\", it's really just the end of another chapter flowing straight into the next book. I've found so far that Series 2 of GoT is making substantial changes deviating from the text of the second book, and I have to say the improvements are for the better.  Far more satisfying to hear people speak to the Lannisters the way they never dare in the books!

B000YAA68C|3.0|I think if you watch the movie without reading the book, then you'll like the movie a lot.  However, if you're like me and love to read the books behind movies, you will be very disappointed with this movie.  If you liked the movie and want to go more into depth with the story, I would read the book!  The best part of the movie was Gerard Butler - definitely made the movie.  I just can't really see him falling for Hilary Swank though; she's too manly looking!  She is a great actress though...just casting could have been better.

B006RUJST6|5.0|A friend of mine on Good Reads raved about this book....<br />My book group on FB gushed about this novel....<br />And so my curiosity was piqued to say the least!!<br /><br />Before I begin... Let's play a game called \\"How many times Calia uses the word LOVE* in this review......\\"<br /><br />Layken, \\"Lake\\", is dealing with the loss of her father. The fact that she has been uprooted from the only home she's ever known so her mom could find a better job. A job all the way in Michigan. She's ticked, and can't wait to go back to Texas. Then she meets her new next door neighbor, Will. And suddenly, things aren't looking so bleak anymore. They it hit off almost instantly. Meeting Will, makes Lake happier than she's been in months. But then life gets in the way; reality slams into their plans.<br />I won't go into detail on what brings Will and Lake apart... but lets just say that it's my favorite kind of unattainable. That part of the plot I ate up like no other. .....I'm still getting chills from thinking about it!!!<br /><br />Layken- (unique name alert!! Loves!*) Is a very enjoyable MC. She has a lot of tragedy in her life, but her voice was strong. Not as moody and down as I thought it could potentially be. She handles the situations brought her way like any other 18 year old would. With massive anger and huge amounts of denial. I don't blame her one bit.<br />Through all of this, she has her humor. I love* any character that can make me bust out laughing.<br /><br />WILL- (He deserves caps.) This guy also has a full load on his plate. His responsibilities are much more than a normal 21 year old would normally have.<br />For what has happened in his life. He is a upbeat guy, and tries to keep a smile on his face. A way for him to deal with his stress, is to do slam Poetry.<br />Whose heard of Slammed Poetry? I was in the dark when it came to this. But I loved* it anyways. The slams were like brief glimpses into the persons life. Wether the person was a main characteror some random person, you'll be hooked just as much as I was by their story.<br /><br />But Will's Slam.. Oh WOW it might be a swoon moment for me! Every female around the globe will LOVE* him!<br />The looks he gives her will give you chills!!!<br /><br />Both of these characters can't seem to catch a break. When their together they get respite from their lives. Their conversations are so great to read, and seemed true.<br /><br />The humor in this book?!? Comes from Eddie, Caulder and Kel.<br /><br />Eddie- I think she had me when she announced to Layken how she met her boyfriend, Gavin. \\"It was love* at first swipe.\\" That girl is a riot. And is what a best friend that everyone wants to have!<br />Kel and Caulder- Kel is Layken's younger brother, and Caulder is Will's younger brother. These two hit it off immediately, and become best buds. They brought a lot of laugh. Especially with their choice of costume. When Layken has to go to their school, and speak about said costumes, I cracked up for a good minute.<br /><br />Bottom line.. you'll LOVE* this book, and gush about it as much as me, and the rest of us! Top Read for me!!<br /><br />If enjoyed Slammed, then you'll LOVE*, Flat out Love* by Jessica Park and A Season of Eden by J.M. Warwick.<br /><br />Also, if you kept count. I think I said, love* about .....about ten times..I'm okay with that. Because Slammed is just that great. You'll repeat words over and over to pound the point home!

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Mr. Taubes has done a great service by pulling all the science together on a crucial issue and putting it in a very readable form in this book. He finds just the right midpoint between too complex vs. oversimplified.<br /><br />He knows how the readers' mind works. It was uncanny how each time the text raised a question in my mind, he addressed it in the next paragraph. He understands how readers think. That's precious, and all too rare.<br /><br />A major recurring  theme is to dissemble the supposedly intellectual foundation of \\"calories in vs calories out\\" weight loss thinking. In other words that it's all about caloric balance (you only lose weight if you eat less than you burn, and you only gain weight if you eat more than you burn). If you disagree with that, you disagree with the laws of physics, the diet experts say. And since  low carb allows you to eat as much as you want, of high-caloric foods - it must be quackery, because the laws of physics are immutable.<br /><br />Taubes demolishes the calories in/calories out line of logic as self evident - so what? It's like saying a person only grows taller if he increases his height. Well whoop dee do. If height were a problem, the important question would be what makes the person grow taller than he was last year? Genes? Hormones? Medieval stretching racks? In what combination and sequence?<br /><br />Similarly with fat accumulation, what matters is - what controls it? Taubes elaborates impressively that the science is long and well established on this issue - but has been astonishingly ignored by the medical community since the 1970s when fat was declared to be the evilest of evil causes of heart disease. (Except, as Taubes explains, that there is little science actually supporting the claim that  fat is really a cause of heart disease!)<br /><br />My only bone to pick with this great book is Taubes' assertion that exercise won't help you lose weight. He bases that argument on the very same argument that he just dissembled, that is the calories in/calories out argument. Exercise burns too few calories to make a difference, he points out. But Gary - you just told us that calorie balancing is the wrong way to look at weight loss!? Rather look at exercise effects on the hormones that guide fat accumulation, no? Elsewhere I have seen various studies claiming that exercise reduces insulin resistance - a key to reducing fat accumulation. I am puzzled why Mr. Taubes did not address this and other hormonal benefits of exercise.<br /><br />All in all, a great book more than worth the money. It will change the way you think about, and do something about, that flab problem.

030758836X|4.0|When the dazzling, ingenious, and selective Amy Elliott finally finds and marries laid-back, hunky dude and fellow writer Nick Dunne, it seemed as though life would be good for them both into the distant future. But alas, some of their marital bliss is façade, but more directly, economic realities strike a major blow. Amy, being the only child of the authors of the \\"Amazing Amy\\" series of children's books based on her imagined life, has a sizeable trust fund, but losing their jobs to the reaches of the Internet exposes fault lines, usually kept submerged, in their relationship.<br /><br />The story begins in eastern Missouri, where Nick has dragged Amy to live to ostensibly be near his dying mother, on the day of their fifth anniversary - the last normal day of their lives. That is the day that Amy disappears amidst several tasks abruptly interrupted, furniture overturned, etc. Told in alternate chapters by Amy from her past and by Nick in the present, much is revealed concerning their psychological states and hidden actions that could have a bearing on this latest crisis. But only Nick is left to explain several matters that have come to light.<br /><br />It is an intricate, interesting story, though a bit drawn-out, with a good cast of supporting characters, especially Go, Nick's sister, the co-owner of The Bar that Nick opened when he returned to Missouri. It is a take on the pathological games that can be played in the context of a marriage, especially by those with inordinate intelligence, as well as perversity.
0679805273|5.0|Oh, the Places You'll Go! is a great book for parents to read to their children, before the child learns to read.  It inspires young ones to overcome whatever.....also, it serves the child well when the child can read it on their on.  Recently, I got a note from an MBA graduate, whom my son met while in undergraduate school....so I know I did not give him this book until he was a college student.  He thanked me again for this book and told me it served as a wonderful inspiration to him....and he was no longer a child!  In fact, he has two children.  This book should be in the library of all young ones.

B0059XTUXQ|1.0|Here is a great lady, who made great contributions to her country and the world. Approximately two-thirds of this movie is absolute dribble about Margaret seeing her dead husband, forgetting who she is, where she is or what day it is. There is precious little in this film that really focuses on her great accomplishments. Today, we in America need heroes and heroines.  It appears that the job of Hollywood is to do all they can to diminish anyone we could look up to.  The same happened in the movie \\"J Edgar\\" where the main focus of the movie was on him being gay and dressing up in women's clothes.  It appears that anyone who has done great things, Hollywood makes movies about them to totally discredit them as human beings in an effort to smear those who we could look up to as our heroes or heroines.  Hollywood: Shame on you!!
B0026IUXO2|1.0|Anti-Catholicism is the last acceptable prejudice, especially in Hollywood, and it will continue to be as long as the Catholic Church remains an influential force in the world. There's an especially disgusting depiction of a clandestine Catholic priest beating a Protestant nobleman to death, and many more false ahistorical distortions await unsuspecting Catholic viewers of this film.<br /><br />Allow me to bring these unfortunate viewers back from this imaginary world and into reality once again. In Elizabethan England, Catholics were so feared that they were subjected to the cruelest executions imaginable. Catholics were hung, disemboweled, and castrated (all in the same execution) while they were still alive. Then they were made to watch as their bowels and innards were burned before their eyes, all at Queen Elizabeth's ordering. Even the Nazis and the Tojos (Japanese Imperials) seldom tortured their victims in so horrible a manner (God rest their souls). In Elizabethan England, this was standard fare.<br /><br />Similarly Ireland and the Catholic Church therein were utterly raped as Protestant Elizabethan purges attempted to eliminate the predominating Catholic gentry, as well as Catholic clergy. There are hundreds of English and Irish Catholic martyrs from this period of history.<br /><br />The atrocities committed by Mary Tudor paled in comparison. It's one thing to tell an honest, impartial story about a controversial historical figure, such as Queen Elizabeth, but it's quite another to lionize this figure, gloss over the atrocities she committed, and portray the innocent victims (eg Catholic priests) of her persecutions as the original aggressors (isn't that how the Axis regimes protrayed their victims?). That alone makes this film propaganda. It's like making a film extolling the scientific achievements of Hitler and the Third Reich and not mentioning the Holocaust.<br /><br />Contrast the reign of Elizabeth with her father, King Henry VIII. Elizabeth and Henry were the early-modern forebears of twentieth century dictators like Hitler. They were both paranoid tyrants who tortured and persecuted religious minorities such as Catholics (St. Thomas More is a very famous Catholic martyr of Henry VIII, and ironically, a member of his court), as well as their political opponents, and yet I've NEVER seen a single positive film portrayal of Henry VIII. What's worse however, is that our modern disgust with Henry VIII is usually generated by little more than a visceral, modern (though completely justified) distaste with violence committed against women, that is, his execution of his wives. As far as Henry's other crimes, we're all historically ignorant and it seems we couldn't care less. Elizabeth carried her father's torch, and continued his bloody work, to an even greater degree.<br /><br />Elizabeth presided over England at an historic time, there's no doubt about it, but, in view of the atrocities she committed, she can never be accorded this level of honor and praise for the same reason other tyrants like Ivan the Terrible and Vlad the Impaler (or in the modern era, Hitler or Stalin) still merit our disgust despite their status as world-changing historical figures. The fact that 2 movies have been made unabshedly celebrating the historic achievements of this woman (ELIZABETH), without showing her darker, more bloodthirsty side, is beyond me.wentieth century dictators like Hitler.

1421527618|4.0|All You Need Is Kill is one of the most fun novels I've run across in awhile.<br /><br />The story follows Keiji Kiriya in his battle against the Mimics, aliens threatening every living creature on Earth. Someone else best described it as Groundhogs Day meets Starship Troopers. See, what makes this story different than most other Military Sci-Fi books is that Keiji here is stuck in two days. Every time he dies, he wakes up the day before he goes into battle the first time.<br /><br />The author takes this neat idea, and runs with it to great effect. I sat down and read this in a single afternoon. Coming in at exactly 196 pages, its a rather short book. However, I felt the story was fully fleshed out by the end. I felt no need for more, I was greatly satisfied. Even though I figured out how it would all have to end about half way through, I still had to know how it would play out. The characters are interesting, and a need to know how this tale will unfold keeps you going.<br /><br />I'd like to give a special thanks to the translator/editor, who did an absolutely fantastic job. I found only two grammatical errors in the entire novel. That is very refreshing, if I say so myself.<br /><br />So, after all the praise you may be asking why I didn't give it 5 stars? Well... 14 dollars seems slightly high for a book that<br />is so short. Like I said, it didn't need to be longer, but the price is a little excessive when you can plow through it in a couple of hours in comparison to an 8 dollar novel that may take a few days.<br /><br />But that is a small complaint in an otherwise amazing little piece of literature. I say go ahead and buy if you have the cash, and enjoy a good piece of military science fiction.

He can now enjoy puzzle games, interactive books &amp; favorite movies without worrying about him accessing settings or apps that he shouldn't if we happen to look away for a moment or help our older child w homework.<br />There's not much more that I could ask for, especially from a free app.  A must have for parents.

1401230423|3.0|Volume 4 of the Sandman cycle collects #21-28 of the DC/Vertigo series.<br /><br />While reading the previous volumes helps with nuances and smaller details it isn't necessary to enjoy this volume.<br /><br />This one is often heralded as the best of the series.  It is also the volume I point to as being the most problematic if ever this series is done on television as has been rumored for years.<br /><br />In this book we find The Endless (7 beings who are not Gods but the embodiments of Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction, Desire, Despair and Delirium, though Destruction is absent) meeting for the first time in the series.  The purpose of this gathering seems to be to motivate Morpheus (Dream) to return to Hell to liberate a past lover he condemned for not being with him.<br /><br />Morpheus is convinced he may well be on his way to his doom due to a disagreement between himself and Lucifer in Volume 1: Preludes & Nocturnes.  Much to his surprise, however, Lucifer isn't going to destroy him in a classic sense.  Instead, he shuts Hell down and hands Morpheus the key.<br /><br />What happens next is an interesting story of many gods, demi-gods, angels and demons vying for the key (and therefore ownership) to Hell.<br /><br />While there are many interesting things going on it is done mostly via dialogue.  There is a lot of scheming and games going on while Morpheus struggles with the responsibility of making sure the right \\"person\\" gets the key.  Meanwhile, on Earth, the damned and demons that were kicked out of Hell are running amok.  This, as you can imagine, causes some serious problems.<br /><br />While the events in the Dreaming are interesting I would like to have seen more of what was going on on Earth.  There is only one chapter devoted to this (a boarding school where a boy had made friends with a dead child and is tormented by three others).  There are also little comments tossed in but that is all we get.  The rest is people talking and planning and back-stabbing to get the key.<br /><br />While this isn't my favorite of the Sandman volumes it is an essential part of the saga, containing many things that will play out in the rest of the series in dramatic fashion.  Gaiman handles his craft well and the blending of mythology, theology and fantasy.  The artists, while varied, complement each other well and it's never distracting when they switch off.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The Hunger Games was amazing, Catching Fire even better. Mockingjay, even though it was still good, was a bit disappointing. I have come up with 4 main points on my opinion of this book:<br /><br />-It was very slow moving; there wasn't nearly as much action and/or suspense like there was in the first two books.<br />-Finnick had become one of my favorite characters, then, bang. He's dead. And to make it even worse, I felt like I was the only person that felt any emotion, let alone sadness, at his death.<br />-I had been waiting since the first book to see what happens between Katniss and Peeta, and all I got was a single paragraph at the very end. What was that?? I want to know more about the relationship between Katniss and Peeta.<br />-I was expecting some big, spectacular ending, and I got that? I repeat: What was that?? I only finished the book a few days ago, and I have found that, since I finished, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I finally figured out why: It's not that it had a bad ending, and it's not that it had a good ending, either. It's that it didn't have and ending. I can't help but feel like that wasn't the end, that there's more to it than that.<br /><br />Overall, the trilogy was amazing. Mockingjay was a good book, although it could have been a lot better.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent read..hard to put down!  I would definitely recommend (already have) this book. It's the first time I have read this author but will do again.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This app has highly annoying notifications. They go off whether your sound is on or off. It sends you updates telling you the same thing over and over. I do think it can be fun, and recomend it for fans of City Story though. So if you like games where you create a town, and don't mind annoying sounds, this is for you!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games has already been reviewed by everyone. That said, I recently read the book and absolutely loved it. Don't let anyone tell you this is just a YA novel. We \\"older\\" adults love it too. Can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. I also plan to see the movie. Suzanne Collins is now one of my favorite authors.
B0055SWM08|3.0|I was surprise how addictive this game can be, and like how it makes me think. It is a great game!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|game glitched, have to wait 270ish hrs for all businesses, houses and animals to distribute, really 10+ days after it's been working fine for days?
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great fun game only exceptions are the cash and the energy i feel there should be easier ways to earn it
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I had looked at this book several times and filed it away in my wish list.  When I finally purchased it I was so surprised.  It was just a really good read.  I would love to read more about the children and the oter adventures in the loops.  Give it a try.  Well worth the time
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game its fun I had to get it on my kindle and my phone I recommend this game its also relaxing<br /><br />l
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is amazingly awesome I recommend it for all Mario lover's and rate this 5 stars for good quality and excitment
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is way too good to be true first its free and its exactly like Mario but instead of Mario it's a lepercon !!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is fun and well made. similar to Mario,  but what is wrong with that? just what I and any platform fan is looking for.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I had high expectations when I bought the Game of Thrones First Season on Blu-ray, for obvious reasons. I've read the books (albeit not recently), and knew that the source material was excellent, but if there was any one issue I had with the original books it was that they could get a bit slow. I actually thought they might improve through the necessary editing that would be required to turn the books into 10 episode TV seasons. With that said, I've started re-reading the books and now, and in retrospect I do miss some of the detailed dialogue which didn't make the cut into the show, but the necessary transformation of the story into the episodic format is as good as any I've seen, and show doesn't suffer for it. The show is epic, and riveting, every minute of the way. Definitely not for the faint of heart, with plenty of gore and sex, but always within the context of the story. This is a very, very, \\"real\\" world, and HBO shows it to you with all of it's blemishes and faults intact. Highly recommended.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the Blu-ray is flawless. I don't have the best home theater in the world, but for the most part the sound leveling is good (a pet peeve of mine), and the visuals are great. All of the menus are easy to navigate in the typical Blu-ray fashion, and the physical packaging is nice. Mine will look very nice sitting on the shelf for many years.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  Works wonderfully and beautifully on my Kindle Fire.  Would enjoy more games like Quell.  Thanks!

B005SFR7YE|5.0|We really enjoyed this performance of Phantom of the Opera.  It was also good to see previous performers of the opera at the end.

1469984202|5.0|I admit it. I was a huge Hugh Howey fan before Wool ever came along. I love the Molly Fyde series, The Plagiarist, The Hurricane, but this book...this story is one of the best stories I've read in a long while.<br /><br />Mr. Howey takes you to his post-apocalyptic world and you become lost in the world of living in and surviving in a silo. You become lost in the need for survival and just being. You become lost in needing to know the answers to your existence.<br /><br />The characters in this book are so knowable. They could be your uncle, sister, etc...I mean you feel like you personally KNOW these people. The characters are strong and I found myself really thrilled with one of the main characters...a woman. I love how Mr. Howey makes this woman like my dang hero.<br /><br />I found myself reading Wool really fast in parts, going forward because the anticipation was simply killing me. And then going back and rereading again. (I always do this with a really intense book and this book just nails you to the flipping wall). :)<br /><br />I would highly, highly recommend this story to anyone who loves sci-fi, and to anyone that dreams and believes that there are things out there...and it only takes one to make changes. I will definitely reread this story. I mean I am lost in Wool. It simply cannot end here. This story has not an ending that I can see...those stranded folks...their stories must be told.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Hugh Howey for an excellent piece of literature.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|great classic movie.very good story line,authentic in every way.very good depiction of the era when gangs were at their rising point.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|The movie lacks focus.<br />Fine acting by Streep.<br />First 20 to 30 minutes are like the Sargasso Sea;<br />drifting and wondering, \\"When does this movie begin and what is it about?\\"<br />Once the history begins it becomes a little interesting and picks up some momentum.<br />Not a well-done film for any reason.<br />After thinking about it, I side with those who are angry that the movie slights the living M.Thatcher by the emphasis on her mental issues in later life while she still lives.<br />The focus tends to the negative, and once again, so tiringly, the \\"media\\" craps on \\"Conservatism\\" and a Conservative Icon.<br />I'm happy that I rented this instead of purchased.<br />The movie is basically a stinker.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This app won't load on the kindle fire. Sticks at the loading screen.  Thankfully the app was free. I would not rrcommend.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|very addicting<br />I like this game a lot. but there should be a way to earn the dollers that you need to buy certain items.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|this game is great. I can't stop playing this game. you play and unlock stuff it is so fun. and you can play with friends by the web or just a game where you pass the device I love it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|wish I had more energy. its a bummer when you run out. but its a free game you get what you pay for.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|She has a unique would and is a truly talented young song writer, and artists in her own rights. She writes and sings with her heart.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|energy takes to long to earn I would like it better if energy was earned in less than three minutes or do not use energy to gather money from houses. building and farming are labor intensive so I canunderstand. but overall I like the story andwill continue to play a week from nowwhen I feel like I might have enough energy to get something done
B0056369RO|5.0|What can you say really. Its hip and current. Music is an artistic impression, and evokes different feelings when played.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a really great book.  Well written and it keeps you interested.  A page turner.  When you finish the first one you will want to keep going.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is great.  The music and graphics alone would give it a great rating, but the easy fluid game play makes it one of the best.
B006VUPCEM|4.0|Unisonic's self titled debut album is certainly a quality release. The album is filled with musical variety, excellent vocals, solid guitar work and several unforgettable songs. It is not an epic magnum opus, but a fresh melodic hard rock release that just hits the mark.<br /><br />Unisonic is comprised of vocalist Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween, Place Vendome), guitarist Kai Hansen (ex-Helloween, Gamma Ray), guitarist Mandy Meyer (ex-Krokus, ex-Gotthard) and bassist Dennis Ward together with drummer Kosta Zafiriou (Pink Cream 69, Place Vendome). By looking at the names of Kiske and Hansen one could mistakenly expect a power metal release, but Unisonic are rather focused on performing melodic hard rock with metal and AOR influences.<br /><br />The album starts with the self-titled song, which is surely the perfect opener. \\"Unisonic\\" is an up-tempo power metal number with a dose of hard rock. Heavy riffing, an addictive groove, several guitar leads and a twin guitar solo, a good chorus backed by double bass, a confident vocal performance and you have the first Unisonic classic. This is the fastest and probably the heaviest song on offer, so don't expect the rest of the album to follow this path.<br /><br />\\"Souls Alive\\" sounds like a cross between hard rock and melodic metal. The song is rather mid paced but still faster compared to other tracks. Things start with a bombastic intro backed by power metal like guitar leads and keyboards. The verses and chorus are owned by Kiske's melodic singing and some solid riffs. The song also contains a great guitar solo and a slow atmospheric part, with some emotional lower range vocals.<br /><br />\\"We Rise\\" is a definite highlight. Heavy riffing, a crushing solo battle and a beautifully sang as well as addictive chorus, provide the recipe for another Unisonic classic. We Rise can also be considered a faster song, although the tempo varies. In summary this is pure gold and reminds of Helloween's uplifting spirit, while the chorus carries a hint of Gamma Ray's Heaven Can Wait.<br /><br />\\"My Sanctuary\\" is an addictive mid paced melodic hard rocker. The verses are filled with guitar leads and the chorus is catchy as hell and a vocal highlight, with some classic high notes by Kiske. The song also features a very fitting solo section and a slower bridge with lower vocals that will work wonders in a live setting.<br /><br />\\"Renegade\\" is another stand out. It starts with a pretty heavy riff which is repeated after the choruses, the verses are much softer, while the memorable chorus follows the melodic hard rock line. Another outstanding vocal performance and an excellent guitar solo round off the song perfectly. If you want to label it, the sound resembles a heavier Place Vendome.<br /><br />My personal favorite song is the epic \\"King For A Day\\". A slower paced metal track, with some heavy riffing and Kiske's flawless higher singing in the verse. The chorus is epic and sang in lower vocals by both Kiske and Hansen in the background. After the second chorus the pace becomes faster for the impressive guitar solo and slows down again for the excellent ending.<br /><br />\\"Star Rider\\" is another sure winner. It follows an atmospheric arena rock path and harkens back to Queen. A simple and softer song, with emphasis on a bombastic chorus and Kiske's truly outstanding vocal performance. On the second verse and elsewhere there are choirs that will certainly remind one of Queen.<br /><br />The 'Limited Edition' (Mediabook) includes a brilliant bonus track well worth having. \\"Over The Rainbow\\" is a captivating power ballad with a truly stunning vocal performance (including some high screams). The epic ballad contains emotional guitar work, some heavier outbursts, an 80's feel and a wink to early Rainbow.<br /><br />Overall Unisonic offers a fresh sounding debut album with several noteworthy songs. Excellent instrumentation by the various veterans on board and one of Michael Kiske's most impressive vocal performances ever. The album's musical variety covering hard rock, heavy metal, AOR and ballads is another strong point. As for the bad, a few average songs and the fact that the songwriting is generally kept to the basics.<br /><br />If listened as a rock album Unisonic totally delivers, if listened as a power metal release then it doesn't. Personally I can't wait for a follow up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is good so i suggest everybody downloads it because u can choose from over a hundred games in just one game
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I saw all the five star ratings and figured id check it out... for any child of the 90's that was obsessed. with the original super Mario bros u gotta get this game....
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|its a money pit. I am going to uninstall it. too bad that the energy runs out so quickly even after you buy more. I was really enjoying this game and didn't mind buying energy when I ran out the first time. but when that energy ran out in less than five minutes I realized that this would get expensive quickly. so l waited the 3 minutes to get the free energy.  I built a storage shed with that free energy but could not complete it unless I buy tools.. again with real cash. I chose to do something elses but was out of food and energy. I could buy that for another two dollars but decided it wasn't worth the few minutes of play. tried to end the game and couldn't.  had to shut down to get out of the game from hell
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I bought my Kindle Fire may be as one of the first few customers using both Kindle e-reader and Kindle Fire. There was not much choice for the covers and so I had bought a cover which was okey but did not fit that well so I bought this micro shell cover and am completely satisfied with it. It fits snugly and folds up well and with the strap over the cover offers good protection except from water. I have not dropped it from my hands hence no comment on its response to shocks and bumps. All in all a reasonably priced functional product.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just great.  I can't believe its free.  I really hope it stays that way.  great controls.  highly recommend. to any platformer fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down!  So well written and exciting!  i ordered the second book the day I finished this one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't read sci-fi but a friend recommended \\"Ready Player One\\". However, I'm cheap and it was $12.99. WAIT!!!! LUCKY ME...the cover of \\"Wool\\" caught my eye under the listing,\\"Customers Who Bought This Item...\\". \\"Wool\\" was only 99 cents. Still not ready to commit 99 of my pennies, I clicked on \\"Click to Look Inside\\". I read the first chapter. I found and ordered the \\"Wool Omnibus 1-5\\" without any more hesitation. I knew I would read all five, based on the first chapter.<br /><br />The story 'got me' from the very first chapter. I don't know what else I can say that won't repeat what all the other great reviews have already said. I eagerly await the release of \\"Wool 6\\" next week and will re-read 1-5 before then. This is worth your pennies, and not many pennies at all for the 5-book Omnibus. You could spend that much at a coffee shop for ONE drink that is gone before you know it. My recommendation is that you forgo just one \\"skinny-chai-half-caf-dirty-vanilla-latte-stravaganza\\" and buy this Omnibus instead. So much more fulfilling.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I love the game. But do not like the comic page interruptions. Gameplay is fun. It is relaxing to play.
1849514003|4.0|It would certainly help if you already have started coding in Cocos2d within the Apple iOS environment. Burba does not waste space on how to install it. The book helpfully points out that Cocos2d is approved by Apple for its App Store program. Keep in mind that this of course does not mean that something you develop with it will automatically inherit that approval. Like every other app for Apple iOS, you need to submit it and wait for the presumed approval.<br /><br />The merit of the book is the sheer number of recipes. Covering every aspect of game programming you are likely to need. Now this does not necessarily mean it will have the precise answer to some coding problem you have. But the sweep of the book's examples increases the odds that you can glean programming hints from a recipe.<br /><br />The complexity of the recipes varies considerably. Each chapter is about some overall topic, like audio. Often, the introductory recipes in the chapter are about basic usages. For the audio chapter, this inlcudes how to play sounds and music, and how to play streaming audio. But a chapter might have as its final examples some recipes that pull in much harder logic. So the audio chapter ends with an example of how to use speech recognition and Text to Speech [TTS]. This uses the well known Sphinx Knowledge Base package from Carnegie Mellon. The book's explanation is all too brief. It just hints at the underlying complexity of the speech recogniser. Useful however if you want to pursue an advanced app with sophisticated user input modality.<br /><br />Another chapter, on Artificial Intelligence and logic, is perhaps slightly hyped. What it gives as examples of AI are just algorithms, that are not particularly intricate. In a way, this chapter can be instructive, if not precisely in the manner intended by the author. It shows that AI is somewhat of a marketing label. The boundaries of what constitutes AI are blurry. From a marketing perspective, you might indeed be tempted to take the chapter's recipes as inspiration for an app that uses an algorithm, and you then present the app as using AI.to take the chapter's recipes as inspiration for an app that uses an algorithm, and you then present the app as using AI.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. it shares the same platform as the original Mario bros. works good on fire. would recommend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is amazing. you can do missions fish build lots of stuff and people actuly start living in your town.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are a ton of fun games. I love them all. I don't know why there are so many negative reviews it clearly says that there are ads in the game so you don't have to pay. awesome free game! totally worth it
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is very relaxing. it is a great puzzle game that challenges the mind but also soothes the mind. Wonderful soundtrack, great gameplay. Easily 5/5 stars.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book i couldnt put it down not even for a minute!<br />4 stars is ot even enough
B0055SWM08|5.0|The game itself is very nice with smooth play and just the right amount of brain tease. But I hate the Facebook feature and being asked to rate the game. I don't want to subject my Facebook friends to the trivia of what game I have played. Finally, rating of anything should be natural desire not a prompt. Even with my 2 dislikes I gave 5 stars but wish I could take 1/2 star away.
B0055SWM08|4.0|a fun and challenging game. something to.play quietly after a long day. like that there are many levels to it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this app was flawless on the kindle fire. a nice,  challenging game, but not so difficult as to cause grief. no bugs or graphics problems at all.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game. Challenging, fun, good graphics. Works great on Toshiba Thrive (Go Thrive!) Lots of levels, cool obstacles, easy controls.  no real downside. Just a great game!
B003ITZBVS|5.0|This is the ultimate animated Batman film. Much respect for Mask of the Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Year One, but this was perfect. Excellent voice acting. Greenwood definitely gives Conroy a run for his money. This film is dark and gritty. Ut combines the comics with Nolan's vision. Brilliant. The action is nonstop and stellar but doesn't forget the characters either. It's heartfelt. DC Comics seem to come off a bit more for adults than Marvel for some reason. That's fine though. I still like Marvel, specifically X-Men and Spider-Man, but I lean more toward DC. Once again, if you are a true Batman fan, this is top notch. Note: Don't think this is a kids' cartoon and complain about that. This is for teens to adults. Enjoy.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|Holy crap, this book was good. I really did enjoy all of everything that happened. It was painful and sad and emotional. There was action and fighting.<br /><br />The Story<br />Lena makes it into the wild without Alex, she believes he died and is heartbroken. There are two parts of the story and they switch back and forth each chapter. The \\"then\\" sections show how Lena integrated into the wilds life. How much harder it was and how she dealt with losing Alex. The \\"now\\" sections show Lena as part of a scheme to monitor the DFA and Julian Fineman, who is the poster boy for the youth getting the cure movement. Lena and Julian get kidnapped and the story unfolds from there.<br /><br />Things I liked<br />I liked how the two sections switched back and forth. For some reason I don't think the story would have flowed the right way if it went solely chronologically.<br /><br />I enjoyed the emotions that were portrayed and believed in them. How Lena kept thinking about Alex and apologizing to him or doing things to keep his memory there or keep his memory away.<br /><br />Julian is a very interesting character and I am happy to keep learning more about him.<br /><br />Things I didn't like<br />****SPOILER ALERT********As much as I liked Julian, I knew that Alex was still alive. I've known it since the end of Delirium and even with so much conviction in the story that he was dead....I knew he was alive. So, I was not happy with the fact that she did fall for Julian because I knew that at the end of this book it would show Alex alive and the whole third book was going to be love triangle....damn YA novels. Hopefully Lauren Oliver somehow makes this okay and not an angsty annoying third book!!!******SPOILER OVER*********<br /><br />That's basically the only thing I didn't like, but it is such a big thing in my opinion because I kept thinking about it the whole time I was reading that I got a bit distracted.<br /><br />Read the book, if you liked book one then you will like this one too. Enjoy!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Just like the title says, WOW!<br /><br />Let me start off with, this is the first field knife I have owned besides the Ka-Bar I had since I was in the Marine Corps.<br /><br />I have not field tested the knife yet, but this is what I would want by my side in almost any situation. This is one stout knife. Compact, very solid and feels like it could do anything. I also like how it locks into the sheath, even if you don't button it,  it is secured very tightly without rattling in the sheath.<br /><br />I honestly would have expected a higher cost to a knife like this. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great knife for your bug out bag. I still  carry other tools for chopping. Even though this could be used for chopping in a pinch, the shorter blade I feel would not be ideal.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I feel quite horrible about giving this book 3 stars, but it actually disappointed me a bit. Maybe I let all of the rave reviews hype up my opinion on what I thought this book was going to be.<br /><br />The story is 100% relationship and character building for only Christian and Ana. Nothing else. The is how I viewed the story, but maybe I missed something. At the very end of the book there is something going on that Christian hasn't told Ana about so we don't know what it is, but then the book ends. The beginning of more of a story and it's saved for the next book. Don't get me wrong I will read the next book just so that I will be able to see what story may unfold.<br /><br />Things I liked<br />-The adult sceans....I enjoyed those and they were definitely steamy. The BDSM angle is not something new for me to read and I believe the author wove it in a convincing manner.<br />-The first 10 chapters I absolutely loved! I was smiling and thought the banter was funny.<br />-The writing style was well paced and flowed well.<br /><br />Things I didn't like<br />-the \\"Oh my\\" that Ana said all of the time at first I found fine, but it was repeated over and over and I was about sick of hearing \\"oh my\\" by the end of the story.<br />-The fact that there wasn't anything to the story except their relationship. It was like, oh we meet, instant attraction, oh sex now, talking about emotions, sex sex sex, hanging out fun times, sex sex sex, super tiny insight into why Grey is the way he is, sex sex sex, conflicting emotions, end book. I guess I just wanted more stuff to be happening. In Anita Blake, lots of sex...but also murderers and solving mysteries. In Shayla Blacks Wicked Lovers series...introduction into BDSM and also someone trying to kill her so we gotta figure out that whole thing.<br /><br />Conclusions<br />I recommend to anyone who likes sex scenes in their book and likes major relationship development. The characters were enjoyable and I am wanting to read the second book in the hopes that we also have SOMETHING happen. Give the book a shot because many many people liked it. In my opinion, for how much I liked the actual story...3 stars.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|El libro es buenisimo!!!! Me encantó monton. Sigues aprendiendo lecciones importantes a través una historia del pastor joven.  Lo recomiendo a cualquiera.
0385737955|5.0|I loved this book!<br /><br />The Story<br />Imagine waking up in an elevator with no recollection of who you are or where you came from. This is how it is for our MC. He gets pulled out of the elevator and realizes that he is in some sort of maze with all boys and no way out. They have to stay in the center of the maze at \\"night\\" when the maze walls close or there are mechanical beasties out there that will kill them or harm then and that is no fun. A girl shows up one day and there is mystery, intrigue and lies. Who is who and what the hell is going on in this place and how the hell do they get out of the damn Maze!!!!<br /><br />Likes<br />Psshh....just about everything! I liked the world building, I liked the bad guys, I liked the way the writing flowed together. I loved and hated with a passion the dramatic ending.<br /><br />Dislikes<br />The ending, what a freaking horrible thing to do!!! And a cliffhanger!<br />Also, the whole talking in the mind thing kinda threw me off a bit, I didn't like it at all. I also didn't like it during the other books either, just wasn't really my cup of tea.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />I recommend this first book to anyone who would like an interesting take on the extents that people will go through. I thought this book was awesome :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun but a little challenging! but this has fun interesting minigames!!!!!!!! you should defenitely buy this game!
0439023521|5.0|I've read this book twice, but the last time was back in October! Time to read it again before the movie comes out. Yes, this book is that good! It is one of my favorite reads. Brings out laughter and sadness and anger and fear...so many emotions and just the right amount of them for me to keep coming back for more.<br /><br />The Story<br />The country is dystopian and separated into 13 districts. District 13 was technology, but is lost now. Every year the Capitol (which doesn't have a district designation....because it's the capitol) mandates that each of the districts send up one boy and one girl to the Hunger Games, which is a fight to the death with only one survivor. The lucky kids could volunteer, but really who would do that, or they get chosen at random by pulling their name out of a hat basically. Anywho, Katniss and Peeta get chosen to go into the games for District 12 and the show begins.<br /><br />Likes<br />Everything! Seriously though, I pretty much liked everything.<br /><br />There was a part that made me cry (and even though I wished it could have been different it was important to the story and wouldn't have it changed).<br /><br />There was the part where Peeta saved her. The part where she saved Peeta. The part where they saved each other.<br /><br />The part where she shot the arrow in the room where they decide her score.<br /><br />Dislikes<br />Uhm.....I didn't like.....okay, in just thinking about the first book, there really wasn't anything I remember disliking. I have complaints about the next two books, but not so much this one.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />what I say is this:<br />If you like YA books and/or if you like dystopian books and/or if you want to try something new if you have not read these types of books before and basically if you are not a strictly non-fiction reader....<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|At first you will be over whelmed by the plethora of information that's available. There's more information than you will ever need which is great but it's a double edged sword. Elecont recognized this and did the best job possible organizing all of it but it is cluttered. But that's what Android is all about: offer everything and let the user decide what they want.<br /><br />Don't get turned off by the hordes of information, take a few minutes to figure it out and you'll see that this is probably the best weather app offered.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I would say this is more of a 3.5 stars for me, but leans closer to 4 so that is what it will be.<br /><br />The story is about a cyborg girl with a step-mom and step-sisters and a prince and the added element of an evil queen from the moon. This is very much a sci-fi book and in my opinion not only has Cinderella qualities, but also Snow White or Sleeping Beauty or all three geeked out in a sci-fi world. Or maybe even a future dystopian/post apocalyptic world with advanced technology.<br /><br />I can't really explain much without giving things away and I wouldn't want to give anything more away than what the fairy tales will already give you. So, the reasons why I didn't give it a higher star rating are because it kind of did bother me that it melded the three story lines (or made me feel like it did) and also because I figured out a plot point way to early (imho).<br /><br />The book was still good and I will still read the next books in the series, however I will probably wait until the fourth book comes out so I can read the rest back to back....oh and please don't give me love triangles!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love how its intertaning and fun. I love it. You should love it to and you should try it to.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|TERMINATOR 2 is one of the most classic films i ever seem...The first one is good, but T2 is really amazing with incredible special effects for the time is made...CLASSIC!
1585427683|5.0|There are two books I read years ago that transformed my life for the better. One was Shakti Gawain's Creative Visualization and the second was Joseph Murphy's The Power of Your Subconscious Mind. My best friend had recommended both books to me during a difficult period, when I was recuperating from surgery. To this day, I practice the teachings in both books, and the affirmations that I've composed for myself, based on my needs and goals, have never failed to lift my spirits, or put me in a better frame of mind, as well as lighten my physical & emotional load. I truly subscribe to the belief that as you think, so you are...and Murphy's teachings have helped me to channel my negative, defeatist, pessimistic thoughts into positive and empowering thoughts & actions. To fully reap the benefits of this book, one does need to have an open mind. I hope many more people benefit from this book as I have.
B003GX5CWY|5.0|This first PREDATOR movie is a classic!! I saw this movie more than 20 times, and still the great story captives my attention...In my opinion, this is one of the MOST relevant ACTION movies of all time with ALIEN, LORD OF THE RINGS and STAR WARS!!!PREDATOR ROCKS!!!GREAT GREAT MOVIE!
B006UIUJ2A|4.0|This book satirises an autocratic totalitarian regime using North Korea as it's model ...maybe not too far from the truth. Wry, and at times terrifying, it traces the life and career of an orphan, who plays an often accidental role in shaping events, and being shaped by them, as his life is swept along by circumstances and at the whim of the country's leader. He survives mostly unscathed, and attains the percarious status of 'hero' of the state.
B003DZX3SA|4.0|BEAUTY and the BEAST is nice...I remenber seying it on the cinema...The story is a TOTAL CLASSIC, with the usual high quality from DISNEY...Really nice, this is a good movie from DISNEY....
B002RKSZKI|5.0|Even though this book is less popular than some of Austen's more famous books, like Pride and Prejudice, I still enjoyed it very much. It's been a while since I read Austen's books and I've slowly rereading them one by one. I enjoyed Emma as much as her other works - it's a great book.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I love all the classic DISNEY movies, and in my opinion this is the BEST!!!! Every person in the world should see this magic movie!!! I really like THE LITTLE MERMAID, ALADIN and FANTASIA, but the story with the TOTAL CLASSIC ANIMALS from AFRICA and lions and hienas is the best!!!From a time where people draw the graphics, without the super computers of today...BRILLIANT! CLASSIC!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this book is based on the twilight series so i keep wondering what stephenie meyer`s take is going to be when she finally puts her foot down.  james has no shame exploiting someone else`s fandom - amazing
B000QE1U9K|5.0|ok, for me ALIEN is a trilogy...This is where it ends...All that came after this is not remotelly close to the quality of the first 3 ALIEN movies...This 3rd part is actually really cool, with an interesting story...Well, this is where my interest for ALIEN ends, but i totally recommend these ALIEN movies that are really cool!
B0055SWM08|4.0|i enjoyed the app.  it is nice and relaxing to play.  especialy nice due to no time limit.  highly recommend
B000W91RUG|5.0|THE BIG BANG THEORY is a cool serie...the kind of lenguage of the nerd characters are really interesting and funny...Sheldon is remarkable...This first season is one of the best, for sure...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely wonderful trilogy. I'm against any sort of spoilers so this review will be significantly shorter than it could be.<br /><br />I did not know about these books when they were originally released. I hadn't heard about them until about two months before the first movie was released. At that time a friend recommended the trilogy to me so that I could better enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Now to be perfectly blunt, this is the same friend that recommended to me the Twilight trilogy. I was not a fan of that trilogy. I felt like the first book was leading up to something, leading up to something, then in the last five pages that something occurs and you get a small cliff hanger. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm not. It was my personal take on the book. I never could get motivated to finish the Twilight trilogy though after that.<br /><br />The cliff hangers for this trilogy are often and usually very good. Each book is broken down into 3 sections, with each section having it's own cliff hanger practically demanding you turn the page and find out what happens. I imagine most people with time to spare to sit down and just read a book for a couple of hours can finish this trilogy in a day or two because you simply don't want to put it down.<br /><br />There is one minor complaint, though it's not about the book itself. The formatting for the trilogy is weird. I never change my font size, it's exactly where I like it but this trilogy started out with the first book being monstrously large font, suddenly shrinking back to my normal font after ~70% of the book, then switching back to the large font at the start of the next chapter. Then book 2 started and it was back to my normal font and remained that way for the rest of the trilogy. There's definitely some formatting issues somewhere but they're hardly crippling imo.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this trilogy to everyone.
B00005JOHC|5.0|TWO AND A HALF MEN is one of the best series i ever seem...this first season is one of the best, for sure...CHARLIE, ADAM and JAKE are remarkable characters!!!The best thing Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer ever done!!!GREAT! BRILLIANT!!!!!WELL DONE!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Love the game, however, the Kindle Fire menu toolbar (on the bottom of screen) is disabled. Not sure how creators expect us to exit the game without physically turning the Kindle off?
B000P0J0A6|5.0|GREMLINS is a classic...The story is really nice with a mix of little monsters and fun that even a kid can see...GOOD MOVIE!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|works like other games on facebook. goals and limited energy then wait to build it up. to the one who can't exit, go to the compass in the backpack and exit.
0788859544|5.0|From all the classics from DISNEY, THE LITTLE MERMAID is one of the best! The graphics are beautiful, the story is totally interesting...When this come out, people used to draw everything in this cartoons...This is ART! Maybe a bit childish, but really cool! One of my favorites from DISNEY!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good app a lot of fun all my kids dealt enjoy playing most of the games they have. thanks for an entertainimg app
B001609SQA|5.0|The first 3 ALIEN movies are brilliant!!! This alien is the precursor of all the ugly aliens from many other movies....And it's still the coolest one...The first movie is a total classic, and this 2nd part ALIENS is on the same high level! As the first, the special effects are amazing for it's time....The planet, the spaceship, the aliens are all really well done...Alien, Aliens and Alien III are absurd classics...I really recommend the 3...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. its just like super Mario bros.......... which I am addicted to. lol. it especially entertains my little brigand sis.
B00003CX9W|5.0|FANTASIA is a magic movie by DISNEY...THIS IS ART!!!I´ve seem this movie more than 30 times, and still one day it´s relevant to me to see...The movie sound is AMAZING, with the images fitting smootly with the songs!!! ONE OF THE BEST FROM DISNEY!!! EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT!!!!

B002VPE1B6|5.0|If the world still exists 30 years from now, AVATAR will be a total classic like today STAR WARS are...The first time you see AVATAR, it really impacts on you...the story is really nice, and the effects are TOTALLY AMAZING!!!!This is really a cool movie...

B000IZ21BS|5.0|CHILD´s PLAY is a creepy cool movie from one of the greatest thrash icons ever:CHUCKY!!!This first movie is a total classic with a good story and nice effects....
B006ZZANDI|5.0|If anyone is a HUGE One Direction fan, then this is definitely a MUST HAVE! It's the deluxe album (meaning it comes with an extra 2 songs compared to the regular album) AND it is like a little book. It has interviews from each of the boys and pictures from both the band and fans who participated in the #Bring1DtoUS challenges. The stickers were kinda.. eh.. because I'm not twelve years old, but i loved everything else!
B0001I561E|5.0|ALLADIN is one of the best DISNEY movies...the story is a TOTAL classic that everyone knows...the songs and graphics are beautiful!!!REALLY GREAT!...ALLADIN, FANTASIA, THE LION KING and THE LITTLE MERMAID are TOTAL CLASSICS!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a simple yet challenging puzzle game, great for wasting time or avoiding work by taking a long poop break.
0439023521|5.0|This book is so interesting and intriguing that I had to go back to my computer and order the other two books in the trilogy.<br />It has been reviewed extensively, but the authors' imagination knows no bounds and it is very captivating.  I couldn't put it down.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Enjoyed this one. Nice graphics and good commute killer. Wish the music wasn't so repetitive. Interesting use of graphical picture frames for changing of the years (levels).
0345803485|1.0|I thought I learned my lesson about getting caught up in the hype with Breaking Dawn but apparently I didn't.  If the main characters weren't incessantly whispering or muttering to each other then they were having the most absurd sex possible.  Really?  Must we have yet another example of a female character too caught up in her insecurities with a controlling alpha male who has a dark side?  Been there, done that.  To be fair,  I couldn't get through this mess.  I stopped midway through when I realized that I was beginning to hate reading.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is very addictive with clean gameplay.  Keep up the good work! highly recommended if you like puzzle games.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A puzzle game that proves how a simple concept, coupled with beautiful sights and sounds, is all it takes to rise above the rest.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|This is a very obvious Mario clone. Unfortunately it lacks Mario's innovation and fun. This game gets boring and repetitive after only about 4 levels.
0143118757|5.0|I set out looking for a way to be more assertive.  I realized while reading Getting to Yes that I was completely afraid of other people's positions.  Learning that negotiating should be about interests, not positions, was truly life-changing for me.  I look forward to listening to this book again occasionally to reinforce what I have learned.
0230748732|4.0|There's no denying that this biography does tell an incredible story - and does an excellent job of raising awareness about issues that might not be widely known to many. Blaine Harden tells Shin-Dong-hyuk's story of his life in a political prison - and it really is life from birth onwards and could have been until death, had it not been for Shin's incredible escape.<br /><br />Through this history of Shin's time in the camp, a picture of a brutal and pitiful existence is built up. Although Harden admits that it's impossible to fully corroborate the details of Shin's story, he does call on information from experts, humanitarian campaigners and activists whose knowledge and experiences support Shin's recollections.<br /><br />The difficulty in fully embracing this book is that you get the sense that there is a distance between Shin-Dong-hyuk and Blaine Harden that was never quite breached, something Harden himself refers to when he mentions that it was difficult to always trust Shin's words. Writing anyone's biography without their full and frank commitment is always going to be difficult and to me it felt like there were many emotional elements of this story that weren't touched upon.<br /><br />It is certainly a remarkable read and I have no desire to see someone absolutely strip their soul bare and be caused great pain. Harden does a superb job of putting together the pieces of Shin's life both in and out of the camp in order to tell his story. If the glue that holds it all together - Shin's recollections and emotional commitment to the book - is slightly weak at times then perhaps that's no less than we can expect under the circumstances.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|your game is my delight every morning i would say as american people say : Awesome cool hot my game I love it

B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome fun hoursnof entertainment<br />I like it so much I don't want to put it down it is challenging and that makes it exciting
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Just my opinion, this incredibly well written and compelling trilogy overreached near the end and cost itself its' share of perfection.<br />Very enjoyable weekend read, even so.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game but there are a few bugs that cause me to keep restarting.  buildings crops and animals stop producing. also it would be nice if there was some way of earning Oregon dollars like other gameloft games without having to constantly buying them.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is very addicting!  More fun if you do not use the hints! I recommend it. Go ahead and download it.  It is a good one.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great game.  Super Mario similarities. it is just as easy to navigate like on a game consol. I definitely recommend.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautifully put together and challenging.  Fun to play for a distractingly long time.  You will enjoy this game for its lovely graphics and levels with enough difficulty to keep you working but not frustrated.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a brilliant series of books. A real page turner, I couldn't put them down. I highly recommend to others.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this app. It reminds me of the one I used to play so long ago. Yes the energy does deplete quickly but I still enjoy it. There has to be some aspect to make it challenging. Extremely addicting.
0439023513|3.0|The Hunger Games is better then the Harry Potter books and Percy Jackson books combine. I loved the second also. Though...I expected a lot more out of this book.  I was so sad and cried when my favorite characters died but isn't the reason why I disliked it.  I thought the book had a horrible and sloppily written ending.  I was really disappointed.  Also, in some parts, it was hard for me to understand a few important parts.  My and my cousin were actually confused on the same parts. LOL.  I wish it were a little more clear.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is loaded with details that make the characters and action episodes come alive in your mind's eye.  No need to use a bookmark - you will want to finish it in one session!  DLS

B006AZZPCM|1.0|I loved this app until the recent update. it says there's a green button @ the bottom of the screen where u can download songs but it doesn't show up. I liked the old way where u clicked the video better. 1 out of 10

0316044695|2.0|It's pretty hard to give a story about a real-world event where humanity at it's rawest was on display and where brave individuals paid with their lives just two stars, but the political non-sense at the beginning of the book was quite annoying. Annoying enough that I stopped reading the book originally (a year ago) only to pick it up again recently and complete.<br /><br />The nonsense I am referring to are the few pages worth of what I can best describe as a 'rant' about the evil \\"liberal media\\" and such. It questioned the patriotism of Americans who themselves questioned the war. It was of the old \\"If you don't support the questionable actions of what chicken-hawks (Bush and Cheney - the kings of getting themselves out of military service) in the White House do, than clearly that means you HATE the troops\\" variety. As well as the standard Fox-News type straw-man arguement about how if the author himself had killed Osama Bin Laden than surely the evil Liberal Media would have demanded he been thrown in jail (and yet the outcome of the killing of Osama Bin Laden was probably the most unanimously approved action by all sides in American history). The author states that \\"Liberals are never wrong\\" - this cuts to both sides of the coin - conservatives simply don't admit that they are wrong just as often.<br /><br />A sentence or two would have been okay - but pages of this was annoying. We all know today that Al Queda went into Iraq thanks to the power-vacuum created by the invasion, and that there were no weapons of mass-destruction (the 'reasons' behind the invasion). The author assumes he found evidence of both, but the history books state otherwise. Iraq was one of the biggest foreign-affairs blunders in American history. Accepting this fact has NOTHING to do with American's respect for the sacrifice of the young men and women who had to fight this battle. People died and suffered thanks to having fought in Vietnam - but that doesn't mean we need to pretend the Vietnam war was anything other than another disaster.<br /><br />I understand that I have the power of hindsite to make these judgement calls. The author is obviously entitled to his opinion, but the editor should have cut that out. The authors clear bent on blaming 'liberals' for everything (isnt that what victims do?) has no place in the book and is out of context. The book was probably written in 2008 (published in 2009) and even then it was generally well accepted that things weren't as they were pretended to be when the invasion originally took place.<br /><br />Annoying politics that takes away from the book aside - this is an incredible story about the sheer bravery and intestinal fortitude displayed by some of America's finest warriors. It's a look at a part of life that the vast majority of us would never dare to contemplate experiencing. Thanks to the author for sharing this with us.
0345803485|1.0|I have nothing against porn but this book is so badly written that I found it annoying and distracting.  \\"Down there\\" seems to be the sexiest word the author chooses for a variety of more compelling words to say vagina.  Her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" raise their silly head at the least provocation.  Her knowledge of the locations where she places her characters is poor and the language itself is not \\"American.\\"  If someone said \\"Jeez\\" one more time I was ready to chuck it and the fact that a young adult wears her room-mate's clothes all the time made me wonder.  I know they are silly things but they permeate the book and are mentioned over and over again.  I'm not surprised that she incorporates Christian's penchant for SM since the British seem to have experience in that but the whole book reminded me of those other books describing a sex scene with \\"his throbbing member\\" as a prelude to sex.  Nothing better than a little sex in a novel, but to read a whole book based on the character's yearning to be laid?  Common people.  I think the book is such a success cause we can read it on our Kindle and nobody can tell what the book is about! Its like a brown paper bag book. The worst editing I have ever seen.<br /><br />One star for being a reasonably adequate companion to a vibrator.<br /><br />I
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I seriously never write reviews, but read them a lot to help me decide on purchases. I read a lot of the reviews of this book and was NOT going to order it for my kindle. There was so much negativity towards this book! I thought for sure it would be boring or a \\"dumb\\" read.  A friend had told me about the book and I was looking for a new book, so I thought what the heck I will try it.<br />I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book and already purchased the other two books and read them both as well. I ordered this first book on 4/7 and it is 4/12 and I have finished all three.<br /><br />So bottom line is...some will enjoy the books some won't ...but don't \\"read\\" into all the negatives. Read the sample that Amazon provides and see for yourself!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It is really fun. Only concern was that energy was a while for energy to reload. Flawless! Yay. Now I'm just filling space, lol.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|one of the smoothest game plays ever. its a fun and challenging game.my new personal favorite. four more words ok?
B001GAOY5U|4.0|I was always a fan of the very first \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\",when I saw it back in 1959. This version of course has taken several elements from that movie, and transposed numerous story lines;which,I believe added to this one!<br /> The special effects were very good;and, using the 3-d glasses supplied within the DVD case(along w/the movie)made it---even more fun!<br />I very much enjoyed this. The actors;I feel, did a good job,and I would recommend it.But, if your not sure...then, rent b/4 you buy.<br />  But, for the price and it being blue ray...well worth the cost...I feel.
076115678X|5.0|This book should be mandatory for every hairdresser! It is a must for anyone with curly hair! I recommend it to strangers with curly hair all the time. It has so many useful suggestions.
B002APU580|2.0|I don't think any person who participated in the making of this movie has ever read the novel.<br /><br />I like Keira Knightley as an actress, but her portrayal of Eliza was too wild.  Although Eliza is spirited, I feel that in this movie her character went from spirited to blatantly rude.<br /><br />The Bennett's lived like paupers in this movie, which was not so.  They were not rich, but they were not poor either.  The girls seemed unkept in this movie.<br /><br />And as many others have pointed out, many of the historical societal behaviors were disregarded.<br /><br />And why was Bingley portrayed to be intellectually incompetent? Nowhere in the book is it suggested and completely ruined the movie for me.<br /><br />I also believe that after seeing the Firth and Ehle version, that followed the novel so meticulously, I may be biased.
0345803485|1.0|I can honestly say this is the WORST book I have ever attempted to read. I am not opposed to a good bodice ripper but this book is so poorly written it made me gag. My third grader can write better than this. I have never asked Amazon for a refund until now but I refuse to give this author any of my money. It is a scary testament to the American intellect that this trilogy is at the top of the best-seller lists. Do yourself a favor. If you want a good romance, buy Outlander by Diana Gabaldon.
0321344758|4.0|It's a good book on narcissistic traits. However, it would be great to learn more how to interact with narcissists, because sometimes we can't just avoid interaction with them. And they are human beings too. So, I hope, next edition will have a good instructional chapter.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought the book was really engaging, it made me want to continue reading throughout.  The hunger games gets more and more interesting and exciting the more you keep reading which is why I really enjoyed it.  They never seemed to be a dull part of the book and I would suggest anyone of any age read it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I must say I only started reading this after watching breaking dawn part 1 (movie). I just had to KNOW what was going to happen next. It was a nice and easy read. I could tell that the authors audience was for the teenage crowd. With that being said, the book was still captivating and interesting. I \\"picked\\" up where the movie end which was roughly 50% through the book and I read that other 50% in one day. I must say it is VERY intriguing (if you're into the super natural/sci-fi reads). Breaking Dawn Part 1 (the movie) was so boring to me and the movie didnt catch my interest until the very END so I just HAD to read the other 50%! I wasn't disappointed  until the ending of the book. (spolier) I didnt like the way the \\"confrontation\\" part ended. It was a complete COP out.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I saw just a few seconds of a book review on the television and the story line peaked my curiousity.  The story is very intriguing and every time I put it down, I just wanted to know more. Explicit language and strong sexual content, but the story line is amazing and I just loved the characters in the book.  You never know what happens behind closed doors!!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a kid.  I made my uncle, my mom and dad (separately, they were divorced) take me... We got the sound track and book... Soon I started writing my first stories...<br /><br />'Cut scene' to today... my baby daughter Sofia... Loves this movie too!  She requests 'Mowgli and Balloo' and the other characters.  After going through it once I use the 'Scene choose' function so we can watch various scenes.  It's a great intro to feature length stories, with many scenes you can watch by themselves.  The music is wonderful - a true classic of the Disney Animation genre.  I've seen nothing of recent vintage that remotely compares.  I also use Fantasia.<br /><br />As a teacher I recommend these movies - they are wonderful.  But as a Dad - what can be better than watching Baloo sing 'The Bear Necessities' - with your kid in your lap! Answer: Nothing!<br /><br />It ends with a depiction of a traditional culture - no worries, my daughter will be a modern person.<br /><br />Also - the voices are amazing.  The Classic actor George Sanders plays the evil Shere Kahn.. Sebastian Cabot as Bagheera.... and Sterling Holloway is Kaa - the same voice that plays Winnie the Pooh, but here he's the cunning python.  My daughter always requests his scene first.  And the scene with Louie Prima singing the part of King Louie is beyond price.<br /><br />Have fun - and be confident that you're exposing your kid to quality stuff!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is awesome but it could use a tittle more difficult level ........I got done with one level and went to the next and got it on the first try but this game is awesome,...........I recommend this game but the price is not right ....it is a good game but not for this amount of money

B0055SWM08|5.0|Ooriginally played quell: reflect on my phone and bought this for my kindle. Such a great game with simple controls and concept, but gets increasingly difficult so that you don't get bored.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great and relaxing brain teaser that has enough of a challenge to get you thinking but not so much that you want to throw your phone. App has a very beautiful and peaceful aesthetic as well.<br /><br />Thanks for the exposure, Amazon.

0151003084|4.0|A small, beautifully illustrated book about different ways children have died. Lovely. Particularly like 'W is for Winnie embedded in ice'. Just creepy and horrible when you really think about it.
0345803485|3.0|It's definately not the worst books I have ever read, but surely not the best either.  The adjectives that describe the sex scenes are used over and over and over and OVER!  I guess there are only so many words to describe the things that the characters did.  It did get to the point where I skipped over the sex scenes completely....\\"Really???!!!Again???\\"  Ugh!  The three books could have EASILY been condensed into one longer book for sure.
1594744769|4.0|FYI: This book is not horror. It is magical peculiar rather than creepy peculiar.<br /><br />I loved this book. It seemed to be a wonderful hybrid of The Borrowers, Peter Pan, the Narnia books and Alice in Wonderland. It was magical and fairytale-esque with a cruel edge. I felt that the photographs did not really add much to the book and I felt that most of the time they were brought into the story in a very tenuous way, and you could definitely read the story without them. I think that most people would have been perfectly capable of using their imagination to construct the warped and sinister images of the various children. They have clearly been incorporated either as a novelty to encourage people to purchase the book, or because the author is too self conscious about his story that he feels he needs the photos to add another dimension. If it is the first option: well done because I have to admit that that is why I purchased the book initially...I like something a bit different and even though I don't think he pulled it off it is a good way to get more people to buy it. If it was the second reason he shouldn't have worried- the story is amazingly beautiful and understated and Angela-Carteresque in places and really something to be proud of. Immensely addictive and enjoyable and one that will definitely stick in my mind for a good while.

0618871713|4.0|So far, this is the rawest and most unforgiving graphic novel memoir I have read. While it is no great shock to discover the inevitable description of male masturbation which seems to creep into an eyebrow-raising number of books by men, it is still jarring and unfamiliar to encounter female masturbation as depicted by a woman, particularly in a graphic novel. Not that the images that accompany the description are graphic or depictive of the event, but just the fact that they are there adds a depth and nuance that is unusual.<br /><br />Alison Bechdel, author and blunt protagonist crosses a line in 'Fun Home'. Somehow. I couldn't tell you exactly how, but the further I read the more I could feel that she crosses the line that most graphic novelists have drawn between what is and is not discussed within their pages, and she disregards it completely. Parents friends who suggest a foursome? It is included. I hope for their sake they are oblivious to this books existence! For me, her flagrant and unabashed disregard for any sense of propriety in this book makes it all the more charming.<br /><br />Whilst you are reading this book, and the diary entries from Alison's childhood pile up, you begin to get the sense that she NEEDED to write this book. It's pages seem to omit a sigh of relief. The literary references to difficult texts are nonchalantly thrown in as though everybody knows about them and has probably read them; how many of us have, truthfully, actually finished (or even started) Joyce's 'Ulysses'? Proust? I enjoyed the bits which used material I have read and know well such as Wilde and Wind in the Willows but other bits are actually fairly dull. It's definitely a 'getting it off your chest' book, unapologetically so. Alison doesn't care that many readers will not understand her references or her feelings towards her father. Only she really has to understand it and, by writing a book, she has found a way to express and release that and, perhaps, find some peace with it.<br /><br />And, might I add, the cover is the most luxurious and gorgeous shade of green.with it.<br /><br />And, might I add, the cover is the most luxurious and gorgeous shade of green.
0439023513|5.0|Halfway through the book I realized I'd have to read it straight through to the end. Hunger games was good. Catching fire was ok. But Mockingjay was in a world all its own. It is still ringing in my ears.<br /><br />Katniss begins Hunger games in a judgmental way. Haymitch the drunkard. Mom the depressive. Prim the weak, albeit, the beloved. Kitty the pointless, the superficial. Gale the he-man. Peeta the blinded lover boy, Peeta the idealist. Katniss the great. Katniss the noble. Cato the murderer. Almost everybody is a cartoon. But Katniss has her priorities straight: her family, survival, defiance.<br /><br />not any more.<br /><br />this is the amazingly beautiful story of how adversity will crush, carve, bend, mold, sink, and push to despair. Katniss the survivor. that's how we begin. In the end, we hope she can find a way to commit suicide. We're sorry there are not enough pills to go around. The berries of defiance become the only means of actual escape. We worry that Katniss has failed to shoot Gale. We worry that Peeta may be tortured again. In this book, the author amazingly carries through, to its logical conclusion, the world she has set up in books 1,2. There is no other option. Katniss cannot be the bringer of justice. This is no superhero saga. Kat niss is just a girl. And she has the genes of her parents.<br /><br />We should have known from the start she couldn't be strong. Not with a mother who sunk to depression. Not when we knew that at 11 Katniss already was thinking of death from starvation. And we should have known that her strength comes not from making it easy, not from flying high above the flames, but by emerging from the ashes, like her mother did; Katniss found a way to survive the upheaval of her reality after daddy died, and she will find a way to survive the horrors of war. This book is not a joke. This character is not a caricature. She is real. As readers, we are in for a ride. Being chosen for reaping is unbearable. Having it happen again, is unbearable. By the end of Catching Fire we are so exhausted that it only seems fair that Katniss should get some respite. She has won, after all. We were led to believe that winning is the good thing. We were sorry for Cato and Glimmer and all of them. But step after step, we are forced, like Katniss, to give up every single thing we were relying on to be happy; If Katniss must lose it all, then as readers, how can we complain that at times the darkness seems all enveloping, the horrors too many, the deaths too hard to bear, the losses to frequent.<br /><br />Being a victor? your family may get murdered; you may be forced into prostitution; you may be killed by both sides; you may become the target of a rebellion, the face of a nation, pulled into the eye of the storm before you had time to catch your breath. Saving Prim? you cannot save Prim. But you had that everlasting love stashed away in your closet. Guess what. Blind love, persistent adulation, the puppy eyes, those do not last forever. One day the other, that which you take for granted, will snap out. The Peeta of Hunger games was not real. Nobody falls in love in early childhood, only to confess five years later. Or do they? It does not seem too likely. Peeta is too perfect, too sugary, too vanilla, too hard to swallow. And if you didn't like that, too bad, because now he's gone. Surviving to the end? guess what? the life you get is not a life worth living. A new regime? how will that heal your pain?<br /><br />Many reviews complain that Katniss was out of character; That she did not develop; but at the start, she hadn't yet lost much. After Hunger games, we thought, she thought, it would all be ok. Yes the president wasn't happy, but we did not see it coming. Mockingjay is like a tsunami. Hunger games just ended with watching the ocean retreating. The point, howerver, it past the pain. Through it all. After having nothing left. Katniss sees nothing more to hold on to. Everything's gone. All thepillars, one by one, removed. What is left? How do you rebuild when everyone's gone? That is the point of this book. It's not about the superstar surfing the tsunami. It is about the person whose entire country is destroyed. It may have been hard for Katniss to kill the boy from one in Hunger games, and losing Rue was emotional, but all that, to look up at the poeple and salute them on TV, she had it all together. This is the hero stubbing his toe.<br />But what happens when the hero loses a limb? What happens when the hero loses their lover? their eyesight? their sanity? What is left when nothing is left? What will grow out of the ashes? This is an uncomfortable place to be taken by a book. This is the land of despair, the land of PTSD, the land of depression, the land of suicide, the land of drug addiction, escapism, anxiety, fear, PTSD, hospitals, hopelessness, physical deterioration. But this is what would happen if all this happened to you.<br /><br />In hunger games we were on fire.<br />In catching fire we were embers<br />In mockingjay, we will be ashes; and ashes are not very glamorous. and not very pretty. and not quite what you were imagining when you saw the fire.<br /><br />It's not by chance that Haymich was a drunkard; and not by chance that Annie was a nut; and it's not weird that Peeta now has nightmares.<br /><br />At the end of Mockingjay, Katniss fulfills her \\"character arc\\" by understanding the realities that have shaped all these people. She develops compassion. At the end, Katniss is crushed and has to rise again like her mother. And she does. but it is not easy, and it is not glamorous. we are in the hospital with her. we are in the closet crying. we are being sedated because we cannot bear it any more. This book may be the only way to think more clearly about the impact of disasters, of loss, of fear, of hopelessness. Katniss gets through it all like a wild animal through the harshest winter. He will not be pretty and fluffy in the end. Close your eyes, and hold on. Even if there is no hope. Even if you know, with all certainty, that there is no hope. Even so. There is a healing process, and help will come, maybe slowly, as you're able to reach out.<br /><br />I don't think the author could have written such a book without first-hand experience with these issues. How could one imagine such despair without seeing it? The crushed hero, the barely holding on hero, the real hero, whenever before have we crowned him? Here, we can. We can go to all the places our loved ones who have suffered through atrocities cannot take us because they don't want to remember.<br /><br />wow<br /><br />i don't think anything could have prepared me for this book<br /><br />the only thing i could have wished for is more
140120841X|5.0|From start to finish, through lyrics and philosophy, through mixed up characters and illegible drawings, through gore and chaos and 'The Second Coming' by Yeats, this book is perfect. It is puzzling and more then once you will wonder if you missed something, but always trust that Moore will come through and make things a little easier in the next few pages. He often juxtaposes events and dialogue so that the images and text are unmatched and spell out a larger meaning, which I think is genius and is a really good way to use the comic book format to full advantage. I loved Evey and the scenes with her in prison alongside Simone's letter were gorgeous. I think I will have to read this again to understand a few things that I'm sure were lost on me but, on first reading, 'V for Vendetta' is an amazing experience.

0375842209|5.0|When Sirius Black fell through THAT veil in Harry Potter, from that moment on I never thought I'd be that upset by a book again. But it has happened again.<br /><br />'The Book Thief' is so lovely and so terrible at once. I sobbed until I couldn't breathe and had to put it down to compose myself. This went on for 75 pages...I counted. It is special.<br /><br />I don't know where to start talking about it. The characters are understated and their actions throughout their book are what determines their character rather than any input from the narrator. Rudy, from his candlelight hair the colour of lemons to his lopsided smiling lips asking for kisses, is joyfulness and vitality all over. Papa, and his wrinkles that creased like an accordion, is kindness when being kind is what kills you. And Liesel. She doesn't know how much she means to the people around her and how much hope she injects into their miserable lives.<br /><br />The stories intersected into the main story (largely coming from Max) are simple and sweet on the surface yet feel so meaningful. Which brings me on to the history which brings this novel to life: WWII and the Holocaust. I have fairly recently read the 'Maus' graphic novels by Art Speigelman and I think that having previously read those made this novel even more poignant for me. Put simply, 'Maus' is the collected recollections of a Jewish man (the author's father) of what he and his family went through during the Holocaust and, in my opinion, it is the most brutal, terrible, unapologetic depiction of what the Jews endured during that time that I have ever read and it really made me properly and thoroughly consider how their lives must have been. To be so suddenly despised and feared and helpless and unable to save yourself or your family from the most horrifying situation inflicted on you by your own neighbours, your own country...it is so hard to comprehend. To be shuttled around for days inside tiny cattle wagons in boiling heat or freezing cold, no food or water, the corpses rising all the time, the human waste and rotting bodies the only bed you can lie on...it just doesn't bear thinking about. I think that because of 'Maus' I was even more concerned for Max's safety, and constantly dreaded his discovery. Later, when Liesel runs amongst the Jews, I was a mess because it's so heart breaking and so powerful and you just want someone do something, to say something, anything, stop them, stop the Holocaust from ever happening, stop it from having to be a child who finally shows love and compassion.<br /><br />As with this whole book, Death (the narrator) constantly flashes forward and forewarns us about who will die and how, we always know how it ends but we still will it not to happen; you still find yourself hoping that, somehow, they will all live. Which represents, for me, how I feel every time I read a book about the Holocaust; I wish and hope and secretly believe that this time it might not happen but it always does. Humans are always cruel and people always die.old, no food or water, the corpses rising all the time, the human waste and rotting bodies the only bed you can lie on...it just doesn't bear thinking about.

1593072937|4.0|It is not very often that I say this but, in the case of Sin City, I am glad I saw the film first. I think the film gave a depth and a soul to this graphic novel that it struggles with on its own. Saying that, it is a fantastic comic and took an imagination of the highest, and rather demented, calibre to realise the murky underworld of Sin City.<br /><br />Marv is an awesome character in every sense of the word; memorable, unapologetically and ecstatically violent, and huge in stature and presence. A tank of a man; almost impervious to pain and bullets, inhuman and with only one thought on his mind: Goldie the whore who gave him the only night of love in his lonely murderous life. I love him.<br /><br />The dialogue is typically comic book; Marv sounds like a rougher and dumber Rorschach; economical with language but what he does say is meaningful and necessary. It sounds like the 40's and makes you picture smoky bars and flapper girls. Except much, much filthier.<br /><br />I love the character if Kevin but I think I do more because of the film than his depiction in the comic. I love the way that in the film his glasses never really showed his eyes and how his silence was really unnerving. It is hard to portray sinister silence in a comic or a novel but a film manages it perfectly. I like the idea that he eats people's souls and it brings him closer to God. There's a message there somewhere.<br /><br />The one silly reason why I knocked a star off the rating was because, for me, the art was a little disappointing. I know it fits really well with the dark and brooding characters and the sinister, grubby underbelly of Sin City as it is all dark and disjointed but, at times, it is really hard to make out what it being depicted. I felt that because of that the flow was interrupted and I had to look hard. Also the noises that are portrayed get kind of annoying and don't really add anything and are used too often.<br /><br />This is such an amazing comic. If you like your comics and graphic novels violent and dark then why wouldn't you read it!?r comics and graphic novels violent and dark then why wouldn't you read it!?

0061020680|4.0|I was really looking forward to reading this as I loved the character of Death in 'The Light Fantastic', and I wasn't disappointed. Although there was a lot going on towards the end and I found my eyes and brain glazing over a bit, as always with Terry Pratchett books, this exudes pure charm, wittiness and great story-telling. The Princess Keli is a brilliant character, and manages to channel a spoilt teenager and Elizabeth I. Cutwell, the plump wizard instead of the usual thin and bearded, is adorable. Mort himself I found a little annoying and felt his character fluctuated a lot throughout the novel, but I suppose that just marks his growth and ageing. It is sad how Death is so lonely. I hope in later books he gets lucky with the ladies. Haha.

B0072GPQNG|4.0|I read a lot of the '1 star' reviews and felt that many who gave this 1 star either did so because they felt this portrayed animal cruelty (it's called War Horse for a reason - and yes, horses got slaughtered in WWI), or they got bored with the lead up to the story.....but one thing I noticed was how vague many of those reviews were - only one reviewer tried to give explicit examples of why they felt certain scenes were far fetched - and in my opinion, didn't do a very good job and backing up their point - so, let me just say I enjoyed this movie. It entertained me, and had some moving scenes that I felt were touching and appropriate - I liked it and would recommend it to others
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've had an Android phone for 3+ years now, but haven't ever used the stock calendar because it's not user friendly. I don't like paying for apps, so I just kept my good ol' paper calendar. This app made me chuck the paper and now I am only using my phone and loving it! Here's what makes this app worth the money:<br /><br />-Widget: There are widgets of every single size available from 1 x 1 to 4 x 4.  The view can be agenda (my favorite), week or month view. You can do many things to customize widgets, like change the design, font sizes and buttons in the tool bar.<br />-Easiest way to \\"Add New Event\\": My absolute favorite thing about this is how easy it is to add something to your calendar. This is mostly what turned me away from the stock Android calendar. Everything about this process is so easy with the Business Calendar. For example, say I want to add that I'm going to dinner April 20th. I click the + button, write in what I want it to show on the calendar, when I click the day a calendar pops up so I can see April 20th is a Friday, but then it also has little bars to show if I have other things already on the calendar. Then when I click the time it has a screen pop up that looks like a calculator, you can type in the time. Or there are -1h and +1h buttons, so if the default time is 12:00 and you hit the +1h button it goes to 1:00. On the side there's 15, 30 45 and 00 buttons. So if I want to put 1:30, I just have to hit +1h and the 30 button. It's so quick to add events!!! No more scrolling through times or dates.<br />-Calendar view: This is close to a tie for my favorite aspect of this app. When you click your widget a calendar pops up with your events written in. It's much, much, much better than the stock app that just has color bars you have to click on to see the event. It automatically opens to the month view, so you can with one click see your month's agenda written out. It also has everything written in the same colors as you assigned them through your Google Calendars. So my daughter's school has a Google calendar I synced to that's in blue, my agenda in pink and holidays in green. It's perfect!<br />-Scrollable widget: With the agenda widget it's not a frozen picture, it's interactive. So I use the 4 x 4 on one of my home screens and say it has 10 events in view. I can scroll down to see more, I don't have to open the app for that.<br /><br />There are so many things about this app that I love. I don't think I even mentioned them all, but the ones that I mentioned are what made me fork over the money for this and stop using paper. It of course syncs with Google calendars, so if you put something in on your desktop it automatically populates to your phone and Vice versa. It is worth every penny I spent on it! I have already recommended this app to multiple friends and family members who are equally as happy with it!ur Google Calendars.

B002ZHKZCO|5.0|I bought this as part of the Blu Ray Trilogy package and must admit that I didn't get it from Amazon as my local Frys jumbo store had the entire trilogy on sale for 19.99 and I couldn't resist upgrading my original Bourne DVDs for the Blu Ray versions.  And what an update it is.  I felt as if I were watching it for the first time.  Rather than a boring synopsis of the plot, let's focus on the Blu Ray's quality.  The video in its 1080p with a 2.35:1 pull down does leave letterboxes bars top and bottom which doesn't bother me in the least.  Colors are clear and crisp and, most important, clean. In my opinion the video transfer is really quite good and saw not one problem with it.  The DTS-HD Audio, however, stands out as being just excellent with wide use of all the surrounds for very discreet channel usage.  Often, and especially for the rear channels, the audio on discs is more akin to the older Dolby Digital mixes where the left and right rears really produced the same audio. Not on the Bourne Identity sound mix.  Each channel was fed its own discreet audio which really made the movie more immersive for the viewer.  A fine workout is called for the sub channel as well.<br /><br />Being the first film of the trilogy, I didn't expect much from this older film but I was very wrong as both video and audio quality was superb.<br />In addition, there are no filler previews for other films or completely unnecessary extras.  And there are a ton of pertinent extras to choose from.  The alternate beginnings and endings were unfinished in post production and, therefore, their color grading and final post production results were never realized as you can see the blowout whites and artifacting in these two extra clips but they are interesting and pertinent to watch.  The other deleted scenes could all have been included in the movie as an extended version as they did not seem to me to be pointless scenes, yet their non inclusion doesn't affect the movie that is here.<br /><br />Other additional features are an interesting interview with Robert Ludlum and go back to how he got started as a writer as well as an interview with the screenwriter.  From a previous DvD release, a behind the scenes feature on some of the most captivating fight scenes you will see in any movie and how it was choreographed as well as a great many more relevant extras to boot.<br />I strongly recommend Bourne Identity as an update to your collection.<br /><br />post script.  Just noticed that the plastic cover  is stamped on the back 'Made in Mexico'.  I have no idea whether that is relevant or not but, as I said, this is an excellent blu ray dvd.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks>Other additional features are an interesting interview with Robert Ludlum and go back to how he got started as a writer as well as an interview with the screenwriter.

0439023483|1.0|Attention fellow English Language Arts teachers:<br /><br />  I would NOT use Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games (New York: Scholastic Press, 2008) in a classroom, for the same reason that I would not present to a classroom of adolescents the recent R-rated horror film based on this book. Why would any RESPONSIBLE ELA teacher assign to her adolescent students the literary equivalent of a slasher-film? How are ELA students edified by reading a dumbed-down horror story that features numerous, graphic scenes of screaming teenagers being ruthlessly brutalized, gruesome violence almost entirely  detached from any moral context? And just what kind of a jackass WOULD assign such trash to impressionable 15 year-olds? Answer: About 9 out of 10 ELA teachers laboring in today's amoral, government-run, public school systems, regrettably.<br /><br /> The Hunger Games, a futuristic horror tale set in post-war North America, appears to have taken its inspiration from modern \\"reality TV.\\" Several reality TV shows of the past decade (e.g., \\"Survivor\\") feature a contrived situation involving a small group of young strangers who have been isolated from the rest of the world, and who are now forced to compete mercilessly with one another in order to win a prize of great value. While the show's cast experiences extreme psychic violence and gratification, a safe-at-home, national TV audience sits and enjoys the contestants' agonies and ecstasies. The same thing happens in The Hunger Games, not coincidentally written and published during the height of the recent reality TV phenomenon.<br /><br /> In The Hunger Games, author Collins has contrived a scenario that forces a small group of isolated teen strangers to fight each other to the death in front of a cynical national television audience. The teens find themselves in this fearful predicament because an evil, future, central political authority---an authority dominated by large, amoral, corporate interests, no doubt---finds this annual blood and guts spectacle useful for reminding its occasionally rebellious subjects of the type of viciousness an all-powerful government is capable of. During the exciting, televised death struggle, the teens are all killed off one by one, with spears, arrows, fire, poison, hideous, stinging wasps, and finally, torn to shreds by monstrous, hybrid, human teen-wolves. The story also features something of a love triangle (which suitor will protagonist Katniss choose, Gale, or Peeta?), but the main event is of course the teens hunting and killing one another.<br /><br /> There are several important questions this troubling book raises for middle and high school English Language Arts teachers.<br /><br /> If the film version of The Hunger Games should be considered inappropriate to show to most adolescent students, why then should its even MORE gruesome literary source be considered a perfectly legitimate reading assignment? Why?<br /><br /> Additionally, the fact that most adolescents would find The Hunger Games a highly entertaining read does not in and of itself justify the book being assigned to them. Middle and high school cafeterias concerned with the physical health of still-growing students do not design their school lunch menus with only one factor in mind, i.e. how tasty most teens might find a particular food. Why then should middle and high school literature teachers who are concerned with the INTELLECTUAL and MORAL health of maturing students be concerned primarily with how ENTERTAINING a particular work of fiction is? Why?<br /><br />  The fact that the Hunger Games has been and will for many years to come be regarded as a staple of young adult literature by the vast majority of government-run, ELA programs is yet another great argument in favor of parents home-schooling their teenagers till other options finally become available.lood and guts spectacle useful for reminding its occasionally rebellious subjects of the type of viciousness an all-powerful government is capable of.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Nice to know that someone is writing fiction about a possibility. Can't wait to read no. 2 and 3 of the trilogy. I purchased the next two books but have never had them sent to my kindle. I wonder why. I can't wait to read them. Please send my paid for kindle editions.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|\\"You may tell a tale that takes up residence in someone's soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose. That tale will move them and drive them and who knows what they might do because of it, because of your words. That is your role, your gift.\\"<br /><br />An impressive debut novel by Erin Morgenstern, The Night Circus is one of those stories which either captivates the reader, or puts them to sleep and thankfully I was most definitely captivated. Set in the late 1800s, you are introduced to 2 young magicians - Celia and Marco who have without choice, been trained for a contest that will span the majority of their lives. The playing field for the contest is The Night Circus, a wondrous and magical Cirque Du Soleil-esque affair that mysteriously appears in different locations around the world only to vanish again after a few days leaving a profound impact on those who visit it.<br /><br />The story is filled with beautiful prose, there were so many quotes that resonated with me and provided such a rich texture for the story that I guess I understand why both the author and editor let the story run away with itself. I certainly would have found it hard culling some of those poetic paragraphs even though the story felt at times like one long description with no real plot or substance. The book is a little under 400 pages yet it was a long 400 pages and I often caught myself wondering if it was ever going to end and if anything was actually going to happen.<br /><br />The book is written in 3rd person which makes it quite hard to connect with the characters and I felt it made the romance between Celia and Marco a little hard to swallow. Yes there were endless paragraphs about lights flickering when they touched and how the world stopped when they looked into each others eyes but it simply came across as text, you never really got to feel or understand why they loved each other so completely. The main characters were disappointing all round - very 2 dimensional with no defining characteristics or redeemable qualities other than their magic. The secondary characters, Isobel, Alexander, Tsukiko, Chandresh, & Friedrick Thiessen were much more interesting and are what kept this story fresh and dynamic.<br /><br />The circus itself is quite simply the star of the show. The immersion is complete and sensory, the exhibits sound purely breathtaking, I want to visit the Ice Garden, make a wish on the Wishing Tree and just sit and watch Friedrick Thiessen's clock as it goes through its 24 hour cycle.<br /><br />\\"You think, as you walk away from Le Cirque des Reves and into the creeping dawn, that you felt more awake within the confines of the circus.<br />You are no longer quite certain which side of the fence is the dream.\\"<br /><br />I wavered while reading this story between a 3 star and 4 star rating. I was leaning towards 3 stars until I read the last few chapters - the solid ending definitely tipped the scales and I decided this book was worth the 4 stars. While this was no fast paced climax that left you on the edge of your seat exhilarated, it was a thoroughly satisfying finale. Like one of Chandresh's midnight feasts, this isn't something to be rushed, instead take your time to enjoy and mull over the minute details.defining characteristics or redeemable qualities other than their magic.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I first learned about this move when I saw the trailer on the net,I though that,if nothing went wrong on the cutting floor it would be a great movie.<br />I saw the film the very first day,and I must say I was not a bit dissapointed,the film simply delivers what you are expecting in an adventure/fantasy/sci-fi film:great outdoors,first rate special effects,amazing animation work and production design,but in the first place,a credible hero(in Earth and in Mars)and very good characters in a fairly good<br />script,and a frantic pace,more akin to an animated movie,than to a live action one.<br /> And all this trying to adapt a 100 year old literary hero to big screen,a task I personally think it achieves totally.<br /> The dissapointing arrived whe I started to read several sources labelling the movie as a \\"fracass\\", \\"flop\\",etc just at the end of the opening weekend.<br /> First thing I though was \\"here we go again,this fantastic movie was going to be one of those,that you either love or hate, a cult movie.Finally,not being a blockbuster,it hasn't performed so badly financially,while most of the reviews<br />I have read agree that it has all the elements to be an instant classic.<br />There are of course a lot of factors that could have influenced the average box office this film have got: it is not an<br />teen reader favourite(not a Potter/Twilight/Hunger Games)The novels the film is inspired in are not the latest best seller just arrived to the shelves,but a cousin of Tarzan of the Apes(another difficult subject for movies).Knowing this,maybe Disneys execs could have done a little better in promoting the movie,instead of regretting about how much did it cost(by the way,the movie looks every penny)
B005MQW5RI|4.0|I liked this movie a lot to begin with; I hadn't seen it in theaters, but bought the 2d blu-ray after I had rented it.  I recently bought a new 3D TV and rewatched the original just to test the picture and figured that it would be great in 3D, so I decided to buy this version too.  I just finished watching it and I'm not the least bit regretful of my purchase.<br /><br />I have a few other 3D movies on Blu-ray (including Hugo) at this point and this one doesn't disappoint in the least.  I originally only intended to watch a few minutes of this before going to bed, but couldn't stop.  The 3D added a depth in every scene which wasn't in the original blu-ray that I'd bought and it felt like I was watching it again for the first time (as lame as that sounds).<br /><br />If you're a fan of this movie and have a 3D TV or are thinking of buying one, I recommend this purchase...you can always watch the 2D version of it if you want and it'll be one of the best 3D movies that you'll own.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I obviously really enjoyed it...almost on the same level as The Incredibles.  It's hilarious, got a good story, the animation is top-notch and the 3D definitely adds to the experience.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|It can be hard for a movie to last more than a decade or two and seem well crafted, well acted, and relevant. We've seen that time and time again with lesser movies. The Apartment gets great kudos for creating a story and characters which resonate as strongly today as they did in 1960.<br /><br />Shirley MacLaine is a woman who knows she self sabotages. Despite her attempts to get a secretarial job she is stuck pushing buttons in an elevator. She manages to hook up with married men and fall for their lives. She wishes she could do better, but she just can't seem to get out of her trap.<br /><br />Jack Lemmon is, in many ways, the opposite. He focuses with every ounce of his energy on working hard and moving up. He makes sure every decision is the right one and he organizes to the T. One way he greases his progress is by lending out his apartment during \\"off hours\\" to married co-workers who are cheating on their wives.<br /><br />Yes, this is a seedy underbelly view of life. Yes, the adultery sucks. That's part of the point of the story. The men laugh while the women cry, and for a while Jack tries to be immune to it all. His worst gripe is that they don't clear out soon enough, so he has to sleep on a park bench.<br /><br />But along the way he begins to fall for Shirley, and her plight makes him realize just what he is doing. He strives to focus on his upward progress, but soon he is having to weigh the costs.<br /><br />I compare this with Breakfast at Tiffany's which is in essence a quite similar story. It's a seedy underbelly with cheating people in it. But where Breakfast at Tiffany's made the life seem rich with fun and laughter, here we see the true cost of the pain and heartache. The lies dig into their hearts, the lack of trust pulls down at the soul. You can see in Shirley's eyes that even when she feels she's in love that it's just not right.<br /><br />The dialogue is great, the characters are spot-on, and it even passes the Bechdel test. You've got strong male and female characters, and where ethnic minorities are brought in, it is done with respect. There are many reasons this movie strongly deserves its spot in the AFI top 100 listing.ng male and female characters, and where ethnic minorities are brought in, it is done with respect.

B007JRU2UK|1.0|Don't bother watching this movie.  It's boring, depressing and has no point.  clooney's performance was not very good.  i dont see how the Academy saw anything impressive from his performance.  I cant think of one good part in the movie.  its really long and you keep hoping something interesting will happen and it doesnt  the whole plot is his wife is in a coma and clooney finds out she was cheating on him.  then she dies and they dump her ashes in the pacific.  if you think that is a good plot then by all means rent it.

B006UTJ6DM|5.0|I had originally bought the film soundtrack back in 1997 after the movie had come out because the music was so amazing, but for years I had felt that there was so much missing. Somehow I missed the follow-up album, [[ASIN:B00000ADKZ Back to Titanic]] which included many of the \\"missing\\" tracks from the first one such as Nearer My God to Thee and An Irish Party In Third Class. None of this matters now that this Collector's Edition is available!<br /><br />Here's how this set breaks down:<br /><br />Disc 1 :: The original soundtrack, remastered. I have the original and after listening to both of them, I can tell you that there is a difference! This new copy is much more crisp and you can almost hear things not found in the original. This could play into the fact that I'm using studio monitors rather than standard computer speakers, but either way, it sounds much better!<br /><br />Disc 2 :: The original follow up soundtrack, Back To Titanic, remastered. I never owned the original, so I can't compare, but this disc also sounds amazing and it's so nice to get to hear some of the other important musical selections that didn't make it to the original soundtrack.<br /><br />Disc 3 :: Background music, remastered. You can finally hear the instrumentals that are mostly used as background music without all the dialog and other sound effects. In the film, these tracks were used to set the scenes and in some cases were not heard through their entirety or were too soft to pick up much from it.<br /><br />Disc 4 :: The music on this disc never appeared in the film, but was added to the collection because they were popular songs during Titanic's era. If you like to listen to early 1900's music, then this cd is a really great trip back to the past! I loved it, but for those of you looking only for music from the film, you can skip this one and focus on the first three discs.<br /><br />Inside the case, you get a really nice booklet with lots of pictures and information. There are also four stickers included that replicate luggage tags from Titanic. The whole collection has been done very nicely and is a GREAT upgrade from the original two soundtracks!lso four stickers included that replicate luggage tags from Titanic.

B003XMUFGQ|5.0|I understand this album isn't The Blues Breakers, or Cream, and it isn't \\"Layla\\" either - there's no dueling guitars, or even the rock of \\"Cocaine.\\" It's a very mellow affair, but that doesn't take away from it. \\"Diamonds Made From Rain\\" is beautiful, and his take on songs like \\"Rocking Chair\\" are wonderful - it's relaxing, and just lovely. There's even one Clapton original that sounds like, well, Clapton. If you want blistering blues, he's done it many times before - see \\"From The Cradle\\" or any of his work through 1974 or so. If you want his later 70s stuff, which is classic too, go buy that. This isn't that, but it ain't bad either. I find it a very lovely album from a man who has given us more great music than most musicians will ever hope to achieve.

0439023513|4.0|I loved the story, from book one to book three. But I'm not sure this is how I would have ended it. Katniss continues to be the pawn of those around her seeking to control the country, and again she much make hard decisions. And when you think things are finally going to be okay for the heroine, things shift again and she is plunged into ever darker waters.<br /><br />Mockingjay is no doubt the darkest of the three books, and the ending was a bit disappointing to me, but you really can't read the first two and not the third. It does round off the story, and you do get a sense of closure from it. Pick it up, finish the trilogy. My only real complaint is after I read Mockingjay, I was awake thinking about how it ended for a few nights.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|This is the only dvd from Celtic Woman which I do not possess.  I am not disappointed at all and enjoyed every minute.  I eagerly await the next one that comes out.
0439023491|5.0|After the first book's focus on the love that wasn't, the second book takes a darker twist. Katniss becomes a political pawn and is forced to decide whether to do as the president says and calm the disturbances that are occurring in the districts, or to rouse them further and be the figurehead of a country-wide uprising to overthrow the government. Not only must she decide this, but she has to keep in mind that her actions will decide the fate of those she loves.<br /><br />I loved the first book, but Catching Fire I literally finished in 4 hours, in one sitting. I could not put it down. Great second part to this trilogy.
0439023521|5.0|The book is good don't get me wrong, however...Chapter 25 upset me greatly, just say it's unheard of and I would have never wrote anything about that. I thought in was inhumanly cruel, a manic inhuman evil that surpasses all human imagination that crosses the line. Survival is one thing I think all people should know but this in inexcusable. Writing for young teens to young adults I would have never injected such cruel behavior.<br /><br />But when I read the second book I understand the Muttations were not the tributes. Not sure what Collins was trying to get at by inflicting such dark fear on Katniss and the other characters when she heard the screams of Prim from a jabberjay. And people recommend to read this stuff? To kids and young adults- Are you kidding me? Go ahead and read it at your own risk if you want your kids to be scarred for life. Be sure your kids are mentally strong and mature enough. However there are governments who control their populations forcing people to weep and wail for their dead leader of North Korea- but they do not create monstrosities to inflict fear on the population. Nor do they force kids from 12 to 18 to fight to the death in an arena. Starvation,whippings and executions are well known through out the series. I'm 40 years old and I can barely handle it. My own nephew who's in his 20's called it disturbing. I do not favor the suicides or the attempts even if it was to trick the capital. You can have honor without taking your own life. Laying your life down to save another is honorable.<br /><br />If I was to write a series as this, I would omit these creatures. But then again we are not far off from this since labs are creating deadly strains of viruses. This what happens when people start playing God trying to control the population through hunger or fear. Perhaps this is a warning to people as well, that if things don't change America could very well end up like the 13 Districts. With people being locked in by electric fences andarmed guards. This should not be. I suggest people wake up and pay attention to our country and turn things around before we loose our country.
0439023521|5.0|I was expecting a good story- after all, everyone has been raving about this for months. When I received my copy of the book, it sat for a day or two before I picked it up. Once I started, I only put it down once. I finished it in two sittings, over two days. The story is gripping, and I couldn't stop turning the pages. The main characters are very likeable, and at every turn I was hoping for the best for them. My only complaint was that I hadn't ordered all three books at once, so I had to wait a few days before being able to continue on. Even though this book is aimed at a young adult audience, do not let it fool you. The story is mature and in some places very graphically violent, but its worth every minute spend reading it.
B007LEC7CC|2.0|This is, without question, the worst album ever recorded by Madonna.  As someone who has loved Madonna's music for over 20 years, it is especially disheartening to give her a bad review.  However, seeing someone describe this as \\"pop perfection\\" in another review convinced me that I must intervene.  There may be impressionable virgin minds in danger here.  In response to that same review, I'd say that the younger generation does indeed \\"get\\" Madonna; they just don't want her as she is now presenting herself.  Without question, her music will be remembered for years after Katy Perry et al. are forgotten, but MDNA will not be.  Or should not be.<br /><br />There are some songs that are not unlistenable.  \\"Girl Gone Wild,\\" the second single, and \\"Masterpiece,\\" originally from the W.E. soundtrack, come to mind.  But with embarrassing tracks like \\"Gang Bang\\" and \\"Give Me All Your Luvin,\\" they are not enough to compensate for the overall sad mess.  One only need compare a track like \\"I'm a Sinner\\" from MDNA to \\"Act of Contrition\\" from Like a Prayer.  In 1989 it seemed personal and liberating; in 2012 it's a failed attempt at offensiveness for the sake of \\"edginess.\\"<br /><br />Madonna's last great album was 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor.  I'm convinced that she has more greatness ahead of her.  I'm down on my knees...praying...that MDNA is the only dud we have to suffer before her return to form....And there may even be a possibility that a particularly enterprising and talented DJ could manage to edit and build something interesting out of one of these albums cuts.  It wouldn't be the first time Madonna has surprised me.
1463514581|5.0|I was curious about this book although I'm not usually a chick lit fan. So I downloaded a sample. But once I started reading, I realized the author's characterization of the main characters was really great and the writing just draws you in. I had to buy this book (on the Kindle.)<br />The personal growth of the heroine is really well written and entertaining. Her story is realistic and she's really likable.<br />The strong sisterly bond, the overbearing mother, the dog, each element and everyone was fun to read about. I finished the book in two days.<br /><br />I didn't expect the twists and turns in the plotline too. The author hews closely to real life, so that good people aren't always who they seem, and bad people might look like good eggs. I eagerly anticipate the next novel in this series. I can't wait to read it! Highly recommended book.
0439023521|3.0|I started reading this book because I saw the movie and I like it, then I read very good reviews so I decided to purchase it.<br /><br />The story is original and engaging, and I have to say I found the character of Katniss likable and even admirable a times, but there was no personal growth or change, which in my opinion should have happened in the arena or even after the trauma she's supposed to have been through.<br /><br />Something else I found irritating was the lack of excitement at the end, when the author could have done more work in Katniss' choices. I'm halfway through book 2 and I'm really hoping for improvement, otherwise the trilogy overall deserves a solid 3 stars, only because it's engaging an it's nicely paced...and because I'm absolutely in love with Peetas' character.<br /><br />If you're looking for something more than a light and entertaining read tho, this is not for you.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Amazing! Just great!The Making of, audio commentaries and all the extras are fantastic. Great pack for a unique tv series! Waiting for the season 2 edition!
B0034G4P4Y|3.0|I'm a huge Tintin fan!  I grew up reading the graphic novels and was really looking forward to this movie.<br /><br />However, as others have said, the plot is very chaotic and hard to follow.  I don't know why they mixed together multiple books and then left a kind of lame cliffhanger ending.  This did nothing to appease existing Tintin fans and won't earn any new ones.<br /><br />Of course, this is Spielberg, so the production was excellent.  I didn't find the animation style creepy at all.<br /><br />But the confusing plot made this hard to watch.  I doubt there will be any further movies, and if there are, I hope they get a different writer.
B0055SWM08|5.0|part way through - it seems like a fun game. perfect for killing wait times in lines/restaurants etc. highly recommend!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I loved the app I think think its fun and it reminds me a lot the Mario bros. I would recommend to others.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a really great game. It's addictive and it's very beautiful. So well done. I got it for free through app of the day but it's well worth the price.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|It is a great puzzler and keeps you working at it. A bit addictive. I do wish there was a way to cheat when you get stuck because I am on puzzle number 85 and I can not beat it. So I can not move forward. oh well, I just start over. It is fun the second and third time around too. It is definitely worth the download and great fun. Makes you think.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A friend was reading this book and loaned it to me, suddenly I bought and read all 3 books in a week. The third book was slow in the middle but was very satisfying in the end. The characters were great and I'm happy about finding and reading these. I'll read them again for sure.
B004UHSB5A|5.0|I love dominoes and once you get the hang of placing the dominoes this game is fantastic. I struggled in the beginning because the domino wouldn't stay where I put it especially on the right side of the screen, I don't know why, but you have to put your domino just below the domino you are trying to play off of and when the green light shines, let it go. You'll get the hang of it. I really do love and recommend this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second of three books and if you have read the first and could not wait to read the second book, this will be one of the fastest read you will do.  The story is captivating, the people are very believable, and the story is very believable.  I just hope it never happens in my life time unless I know Katnip!
B005HSL626|5.0|I play this game a lot. I am an adult clearly over the age of ___ (Just guess)<br /><br />Many have complained about the ads being inappropriate for kids and annoying to others.  JUST TURN OFF THE WIFI!<br /><br />Whenever I play FN or angry birds, I don't want the ads either. So I turn off the Wifi. In fact, I usually don't have the Wifi on whenever I am using my Fire or my Baby Kindle - I only need it to download something, or to listen to streaming music or watch streaming video.  Otherwise, I just keep it off.<br /><br />that works for me!<br />sandy
B003O86FMW|2.0|This did not have to be a trilogy. Was fascinated with the first book but thought the second and third were a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on a brand and make money. Could have been one book.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I now own both the DVD set with the Original and redone versions & this Blu-ray. Here's my take on the differences.<br /><br />It's easy to see what George Lucas thinks of us that want the original in Blu-ray quality: This version (with all it's digital 'enhancements' is beautiful. The colors look as if they were filmed on well-lit locations, not done with 1970's technology.<br /><br />The 'original' DVD, on the other hand wasn't even given full-screen status; it's shown in a box on my TV (on my DVD player, although my Blu-ray expands it automatically) as if I was watching it on YouTube. Even in a reduced size version, you can't miss the compression artifacts that cover the screen like a low-rez mpeg. It looks better upscaled on my blu-ray, but I still see the artifacts.<br /><br />The updated DVD is much better. At least it covers the full TV screen and lacks the digital artifacts. Both DVDs are a bit too bright in all conditions, probably to show detail that would be lost in the darker scenes.<br /><br />If you want the original story without the new distracting clutter, you won't want this Blu-ray (stick to the Limited Edition set, if you can find it). If you can deal with the changes (maybe consider it a good remake, instead), the color, detail, special effects, and sound make this a beauty to behold.<br /><br />As to the \\"Han shot first\\" complaints; I personally don't care who shot first, but I have a question for Mr. Lucas: If someone (a professional assassin at that) is holding a gun (bullet or laser) two feet from your head and pulls the trigger when he's confident he's safe, how likely is it that he'll miss?
B0076303RY|5.0|This was my first time \\"buying\\" a video download and it work perfectly.  It was easy, I got what I ordered, and although I was not able to watch it until two weeks later it was still there and worked fine.  I will do it again.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a great game for all to play its not hard to complete the tasks like some games
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love its awesome I mean it keeps me orginized and on top of things. I am always on schedule. Its great I love it.
0156034026|3.0|I had to read this book for class and I did not really enjoy it. While many of my friends did like the book, I felt that I wanted to kill Changez by the end.<br />What I hated about it is the way it is presented through Changez's words. It became annoying to listen to him ramble about his life. It is also important that I don't enjoy the romance side of the book and therefore I was mostly sick of Erica and her life. Her story was mundane to me.<br />Other than that, there various aspects to praise in the book. My favorite thing is the ending which was really smart. By leaving the reader with an open ending, it leaves him/her with the question of where does he/she stand on the questions posed by Changez on America. While Erica may have been a symbol to Changez's relationship with America, I felt that the Moshin Hamid spent too much time on her and should have found other ways to express his ideas, at least his ways did not get to me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game its like a lot of games in one this game is amazing I love 101 games
0307454568|5.0|This is the third book in the series, and the last. I was scared that it would be open ended like the second one, but I would say that the story did come to a conclusion! The main character intrigued me so much in one and two, one can't help but wonder why she is the way that she is. Not only does this novel contain action and suspence like the others, you learn the truth behind Salander. If you read the first two, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS!!!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is a good puzzler I would have paid but it was free application of the day pick it up
B0055SWM08|4.0|its a fun game to kill the time. starts off easy, but ends up pretty challenging. no problems on HTC EVO 4g

B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun and a great idea but some of the games are better for the size of a phone not a.tablet and ssometimes the games freeze
B007H7XJD4|3.0|It's close to 300, but lacks a fully-defined world.<br /><br />Synopsis and Plot Summary:<br /><br />King Hyperion declares war on humanity and seeks the all-powerful Bow of Epirus which he will use to unlock the imprisoned Titans. Theseus, a human peasant is favored and trained by Zeus incarnate to become the savoir of all humanity.<br /><br />General Angle:<br /><br />This is 300 turned up a notch by replacing the Spartans with fighting gods. 300 was based loosely around true events and Immortals gives the same visual treatment to Greek Mythology.<br /><br />The New and Original:<br /><br />The gods are young and active. No more lounging around in floating clouds, wearing togas and eating grapes. Titans (who were supposed to be as strong as or stronger than the gods) are skillful warriors and not the far-from-factual monsters depicted in Clash of the Titans. For the record, Medusa and the Kraken are not Titans.<br /><br />What's Old and Borrowed:<br /><br />Slow motion combat sequences. A hero that is TOLD he's a hero, BECOMES a hero without doing too many heroic things. A single weapon/object that's so powerful it can defeat armies. Yes, more movies like Lord of the Rings and Krull. A woman who serves no purpose besides being eye candy- yes, that's Megan Fox in The Transformers.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer for this movie two years ago, I quietly leaned over to my girlfriend and said \\"They made this one for me.\\" Really, it's a guy's movie with the looks of intense battles and non-stop action. I love the combination of great visuals and majestic vistas. I like when moments in a movie have additional impact from meaningful storylines and solid character development. I do. This is a great movie, but its total ranking on my charts suffers from flaws in its foundation. Since 300 is its too- close- for- kissing -cousin, we'll offer some comparisons.<br /><br />I'll skip over the slow-mo fight scenes and partial nudity to nudity (ahem) and Rourke (Hyperion) verse um...the guy who played Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). It's about the believability of the world. That makes the action have meaning, the plot twists intriguing, the characters have dimension and the storyline have a logical course. That's what's missing here. Oh, by the way, if you're the kind of movie fan that only cares about loud explosions, action stunts, hot chicks and plots as simple as The Dukes of Hazzard; just go see the movie, its' awesome.<br /><br />I expected more and at first I couldn't figure out why I wasn't enjoying this epic as much as I should have. I figured out why the remake of Clash of the Titans missed the bullseye for me. It was a pacing problem. Everything happened so fast; nothing had any meaning. He gets the Pegasus, no big deal. It's just a flying horse. No sense of wonder there. Even the hero Perseus seemed unimpressed. Dude, you just got a flying horse! Both Troy and Alexander had some great moments, but the impact was lessened by all the badly executed scenes between battles.<br /><br />In Immortals, it's the world that's lacking. I read that Director Tarsem Singh had a lot of control over this movie. With movies like The Cell and The Fall under his belt, you have no doubts about his ability to tell a tale with visual flair. But for Immortals it seems as though the one-man's-vision approach leads us to numerous plot holes and logic-defying devices.<br />Let's take a look at some of them: SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!!!!!<br /><br />1. Early in, Theseus is told he must wait a day to evacuate his village before the rapidly advancing army of Hyperion. The privileged upper class is leaving immediately and the poor must wait 24 hours. Why? And why wouldn't he just leave on his own? If you were told a flood was coming and you must evacuate, but only certain people could leave now, would you say \\"Oh, okay\\" and stick around? Exactly.<br /><br />2. Next, a captured Theseus is sent to the salt mines to work. At night the slaves are corralled near a fountainwhere the (hot) Virgin oracles are also getting a sip or two. And the hotties are chilling one-room over at the Hyperion-Hotel-Six. Who would mix rough slaves with the sexy virg-...oh wait, why are there only four slaves at the salt pit? Why do we never enter the salt mines and only see the front door? Why are there so few guards? How do they get from the salt flats back to...wait...<br /><br />3. Everything in this world is a few minutes walk. At least when King Leonidas, in 300, showed his map, it did look like walking distance. They also omit any means of travel. The massive army of Hyperion has no horses, carriages or any depicted means of getting around. We only (really) saw two horses in the entire movie and they seemed thrown in at the last minute to solve another How do we get there quick? problem.<br /><br />4. She's the virgin oracle that never sees a useful vision. She was hunted down because she could lead Hyperion to the Epirus Bow, but um...she didn't know where it was and our hero found it on his own, by accident. And after she loses her visionary powers by having sex (like she couldn't wait till the end of the movie) she's still around and truly serving no purpose. Speaking of serving no purpose, did you think the Monk who sliced off his own tongue was going to have some kind of significance after sticking around so long? Me too.<br /><br />5. Yay, a cool scene involving Poseidon making a giant wave. How come the main characters can leave the boat, but the bad guys stayed in the boat and just watched the wave come. AND the Oracle said something to the effect of staying steadfast when the sky thunders. Well, she quoted that line right before the tidal wave hit and our hero did the opposite. He jetted off that boat like he leaned over and saw the name Titanic written on the side.<br /><br />6. Their plan is to commandeer a merchant boat of Hyperion's navy, but at the dock, there's no one. No other boats, crews or merchants or goods even...and that leads us to another problem.<br /><br />7. Aside from the bad-guy action figures like the hawk-guy, the Bull guy and the beast, everyone else in Hyperion's army is a generic foot soldier. No generals, captains or anyone else of any rank or skill. In 300, you saw assorted flavors in the Xerxes forces. They seemed like a conquering horde. In Immortals, they felt like the extras they were.<br /><br />8. Speaking of people, in 300 I could see myself living in that universe, tending, crafting, hell maybe I'd be some kind of musician there too. In Immortals they never showed us Hellenic life to actually see what Theseus would have been fighting to save. Same with the gods. What do they do besides watch us? I wish we knew more about their world. Had their universe been more and better defined, I might have more to walk away with- than the memories of some very cool and graphically charged combat scenes.<br /><br />I could go on longer, but I'm even getting tired of taking apart this movie. It's good, long as you watch it lightly and don't think too deeply about anything besides the beauty of the visually visceral violence. I rate it a 8.5 and 300 a 9.2where the (hot) Virgin oracles are also getting a sip or two. And the hotties are chilling one-room over at the Hyperion-Hotel-Six. Who would mix rough slaves with the sexy virg-...oh wait, why are there only four slaves at the salt pit? Why do we never enter the salt mines and only see the front door?

B006W0QOF2|5.0|I'm not sure what drove me to see Drive. Watching the trailer left me thinking Drive was a story about a race car driver who works on the side driving getaway cars for thieves and other criminals. Some aspects made it look like an action roadster movie with tons of chase scenes and big `escape the police' action sequences.<br /><br />There's a little bit of that, but a whole lot more under the hood. The director, Nicolas Winding Refn, has recreated a 1970s styled....Burt Reynolds flick mixed with a little James Dean cool. Ryan Gosling (also in The Notebook and The Ides of March, opposite George Clooney) is cast as `the kid', an unnamed mechanic with a sordid past and dangerous alter-ego hiding behind his outer shell of innocence. It's a great casting that at first makes you wonder how `the kid' can change the world around him with his quiet and soft demeanor.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple and straightforward. The kid befriends a lone mother and child and their growing relationship is complicated by the release of the boy's father, a Standard Gabriel (played by Oscar Isaac from Sucker Punch). His troubles follow him out of the box as he finds himself still boxed in and needs to pull off one last job. It's an odd proposition for our driver. He has the unique skill-set to help, but why is he risking his life, only to help the woman he wants- move on without him? If everything goes well...c'mon you know the rest. That last job never turns out as planned.<br /><br />A woman who left the theater ahead of me said she felt like her stomach tightened up and only relaxed as the credits rolled. I agree. This is a suspenseful movie that revels in its atmosphere. It feels dark and ominous. The cinematography and location(s) help sink us into bleakness as L.A. is rendered as a far away glittery and dreamy backdrop to the darkest of places, characters and deeds.<br />Bernie Rose, played by Albert Brooks, is the perfect combination of mobster, thug and 1940s gangster. When meeting the kid, there is a tense moment when a handshake is expected. The Driver pauses and you wonder if their relationship is going to start off with an insult. The kid says his hands are dirty and so that's why he's not shaking hands. Bernie Rose replies `so are mine'. The double meaning of `dirty hands' and the interplay between characters throughout is well scripted and executed.<br /><br />At some point I would like to revisit this movie and discuss it again after it's been around a while so we can include spoilers and twists.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movies. I felt like I had seen a throwback to a grittier era. The on-screen violence is filmed in a very realistic way. It's shocking without being done for shock value. It also explains why your stomach was so knotted. You knew it was coming.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that gets better the more you think about it. As you remember how cool this scene and that scene was and how some of the simplest of actions are given so much weight and meaning, you'll realize you've seen a really good movie. There's lots of symbolism and repeated motifs to pick up so it also stands up well in repeat viewings. I recommend this movie to all my friends. It's a little hard to describe so I pretty much say \\"just see it and then we'll talk about it\\".<br /><br />I'm not a movie critic; I'm just critiquing a movie.eeting the kid, there is a tense moment when a handshake is expected.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|now its the monkeys turn ha. a new adventure for my favorite birds. its easier to get three stars on these levels
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|Taken from me Blogsite!<br />After reading all the lackluster reviews for the updated The Thing movie, I passed on the theatrical release and figure I'd wait for the DVD rental. Before picking up on the re-imaging, I thought it might be wise to watch the original 1951 Howard Hawking version along with John Carpenter's The Thing 1982 update.<br /><br />The Thing from another World (1951)<br /><br />I remember this B&W classic from my childhood and being creeped out by the huge humanoid monster stalking through the hallways like an unstoppable Juggernaut. You didn't need special effects or sophisticated graphics to turn a man into an alien beast. Giant hands and a helmet, along with good physical acting, was enough to convince anyone back then.<br /><br />Watching the dialogue now reminds me of the different deliveries and sense of timing actors used in those early days of cinema. The rapid fire speeches gave a sense of military formality, efficiency and added a rushed importance to every line. We have the classic commander who is respectfully chided by his men and who is in full command, but also willing to listen to solid ideas from the men under him. He comes off as not knowing everything, but still being the smartest. Yes, they chose a military officer who uses common sense.<br /><br />The scientist is still the early clich&eacute; of wanting knowledge of the unknown and is willing to sacrifice everything - including human life to get it.  To his un-cowardly credit, he is willing to trade his own life in exchange for furthering our understanding of the universe. Of course, he does an ill-advised, morally questionable experiment that does give us our only look into the habits of the monster. In this case, the alien visitor is a humanoid beast that has apparently evolved from plant life and feeds on blood. The sled dogs are fodder and food and have little involvement with the creature besides attacking the intruder early on.<br /><br />This is a great movie that stands as a perfect example of our early paranoia about alien visitors and invasions. It ends with the memorable line \\"Keep Watching the Skies\\".<br /><br />The Thing 1982<br /><br />John Carpenter takes the basic concept and updates the science while keeping the atmosphere intact. He takes environmental factors like the cold and isolation and turns them into major plot points. He uses a research station as the backdrop and assembles regular men to go up against the threat from outer space. The monster has been turned up a few notches too. The original was a menacing brute and this version pits the humans against a shape-shifting alien that can impersonate any living organism it comes in to contact with. Assimilation after annihilation. Our paranoia over space invasions has been replaced with paranoia over who you can trust as it isn't clear who is friend and who is foe- who you can turn to and who's been turned.<br /><br />We still have the alien saucer under the ice as the initial point of contact, but even that idea is pushed further as the alien tries to build another ship using spare parts from around the base in order to make his escape. The original alien was pretty smart for cutting the power, but this guy is really sharp (no pun intended). The surrounding cast is composed of well crafted characters and the main protagonist is the helicopter pilot J.R MacReady played by Kurt Russel. The movie has more of a singular focus as we mostly follow MacReady and learn as he learns. Like the best of horror movies, our characters are placed in a near hopeless situation and it's only their spirit and willingness to live that keeps them going. If the original ended with the line Watch the Skies, this one should end with \\"watch the man next to you\\". This is one of the few times where a remake does justice to the source material.<br /><br />The Thing 2011<br /><br />The newest version is listed as a prequel and although the events of this film bring us within a few hours of the 1982 John Carpenter classic, it still feels like a modern translation since several key scenes are recreated. I'm not sure why director Matthijis van Heijningen Jr would choose to helm this movie as his first big release. It wasn't as though the 82 version was dated or The Thing represents some sort of big money franchise that needed to be restarted or reinvigorated like Star Trek.<br /><br />Most modern horror flicks reply on jump gags where there's a meaningless, but sudden action meant to deliver a quick jolt of fear. It's the old cat jumping out of the cupboard and unfortunately that's the engine behind this movie. It lacks the hard science and joy of discovery from the first movie and misses the `who can I trust?' paranoia of the second. There is a good attempt to recreate that tension, but it falls flat since all the characters are fairly generic. It's pretty much a few random Americans and a bunch of crazy Norwegians. When you compare this cast with stand-out characters from John Carpenter's take, you'll quickly realize why the deaths are meaningless. The writers Eric Heisserer, John W. Campbell Jr. never gave us any personalities to connect with. The main character, a Kate Lloyd played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a fine job as the one sensible character. It's obvious from the beginning that she deserves to live and everyone else deserves to die for being so stupid.<br /><br />The 1982 Thing did its best to show us a monster that was doing things on-screen that we had never seen before- from growing heads - to assimilating dogs- to, damn, just being gross and scary. The monster in this affair is a multi-lobster-limbed crawler and, I must admit, quite formidable. It copies the big punch-line or becoming a grotesque merging of all the victims it's absorbed, but in this case, it looks kinda silly. When you finally get the payoff of seeing a version of the monster in full light, it's a little disappointing and honestly, non-scary. Still, it does better to deliver the chills than the current crop of disposable horror-flicks Hollywood has been churning out in recent years.<br /><br />In the original movie, it's science verse the military when the army men want to destroy the dangerous alien and the mad scientist wants to be friends and preserve the monster at all costs. And although that was the same foolish opinion held by the upper branches of the military, it didn't seem so sinister. The 1982 film simply stands us up against a monster we don't understand and survival is the only goal. The 2011 thing brings us another dumb scientist, but you could argue that his interest also lie in a quest for personal glory. \\"We May lose this find\\" yes, he has a personal interest and is in it for his own immortality and legacy.<br /><br />The music/soundtrack borrows or pays homage to the 1982 score by Ennio Morricone. Those two ominous tones drop at the very start and at the end of the movie. It makes for a nice wrapper. Speaking of endings, 1982 left us with two characters staring at each other with complete distrust. This is an amazing stalemate and a good way to end a classic. This movie, in perfect step with the younger generation, cannot leave anything to the imagination and we get a big impact. Yeah, I must admit this is a welcome twist.<br /><br />Overall, I consider the 2011 The Thing to be a good movie. It's worth seeing if you're a fan of the original and the 1982 revisit. The original was a statement of our time and left a marker that exposed how we felt about first contacts. The second was a statement about the human condition and what it would take to break down the bonds that hold us together as a species. This third version details who we are in 2011 and beyond. Simply put: we are creatures that seem capable of holding on to every memory and experience while we refuse to let anything with $entimental value go. Once, we had a disposable culture, but now we have one of recycling: it's all old- fashion, phrases, influences and ideas. The big question for every revisit or re-imaging is what are you going to add? Are you going to give us useful background information? Are you going to develop a beloved character more? Are you fixing technical flaws or enhancing an experience? The problem I have with most rehashes is that the priority lies in bringing us the memorable moments while forgetting to include the WHY as far as why we chose to hang on to those moments to begin with. I think I'm going to watch the 1982 version again. Thank you John Carpenter for including the why.the chills than the current crop of disposable horror-flicks Hollywood has been churning out in recent years.<br /><br />In the original movie, it's science verse the military when the army men want to destroy the dangerous alien and the mad scientist wants to be friends and preserve the monster at all costs. And although that was the same foolish opinion held by the upper branches of the military, it didn't seem so sinister. The 1982 film simply stands us up against a monster we don't understand and survival is the only goal. The 2011 thing brings us another dumb scientist, but you could argue that his interest also lie in a quest for personal glory. \\"We May lose this find\\" yes, he has a personal interest and is in it for his own immortality and legacy.<br /><br />The music/soundtrack borrows or pays homage to the 1982 score by Ennio Morricone. Those two ominous tones drop at the very start and at the end of the movie. It makes for a nice wrapper. Speaking of endings, 1982 left us with two characters staring at each other with complete distrust. This is an amazing stalemate and a good way to end a classic. This movie, in perfect step with the younger generation, cannot leave anything to the imagination and we get a big impact. Yeah, I must admit this is a welcome twist.<br /><br />Overall, I consider the 2011 The Thing to be a good movie. It's worth seeing if you're a fan of the original and the 1982 revisit. The original was a statement of our time and left a marker that exposed how we felt about first contacts. The second was a statement about the human condition and what it would take to break down the bonds that hold us together as a species. This third version details who we are in 2011 and beyond. Simply put: we are creatures that seem capable of holding on to every memory and experience while we refuse to let anything with $entimental value go. Once, we had a disposable culture, but now we have one of recycling: it's all old- fashion, phrases, influences and ideas. The big question for every revisit or re-imaging is what are you going to add? Are you going to give us useful background information? Are you going to develop a beloved character more? Are you fixing technical flaws or enhancing an experience? The problem I have with most rehashes is that the priority lies in bringing us the memorable moments while forgetting to include the WHY as far as why we chose to hang on to those moments to begin with. I think I'm going to watch the 1982 version again. Thank you John Carpenter for including the why.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|it's fun, even my kids like to play it.... It also has a bit of realism as the milk can crush the eggs and bread etc.
B005LAIGZU|4.0|An elite SEAL team is tasked with recovering a captured CIA agent. They stumble across intelligence which leads them on an international man-hunt for a terrorist who is plotting strikes within the US.<br /><br />The movie overall has a tough job of walking the line between being action-packed and realistic. The film uses active/real Navy SEALs, which causes a small hit in the acting department. Lines are delivered like real human beings having a conversation and not with over the top drama like most war movies- even in combat they get on with soldiering and never have that hysterical \\"Oh no, what do we do now?!\\" moment. It's like we are an invited guest overhearing the military briefings and are eavesdropping in on intimate conversations with the team members. This works out well as it builds a sense of intimacy between us; the viewing audience, and the SEALs.<br /><br />Act of Valor follows many real military protocols and it was nice to hear the proper and more correct use of the phrase `Frag-Out' as opposed to \\"Fire in the Hole\\", which is used in most movies. They took a few liberties by showing the SEALs acting without air support for several of their missions and having this single unit deployed for the entire movie -on missions spanning the globe. I guess we don't have that many SEALs after all- maybe fitting since they do say \\"Damn Few\\". To explain the limited use of Air Calvary, one officer explained that they did not want another \\"Blackhawk Down\\" and so it was boots on the ground for the entire mission. Nice reference.<br /><br /> The Video Game Connection<br /><br />Many other reviews are calling this movie an Army Recruitment commercial. I didn't see that at all. I felt a sense of pride for our armed forces and took a second look at the kinds of sacrifices our men and women are asked to make as part of their service. Top Gun was the kind of movie that made you want to fly a jet by the end. Hell, they started putting recruitment booths outside the theaters when that movie hit full momentum. Act of Valor made me want to play a game like Call of Duty or anything where I get to rush buildings and shoot terrorists. They even placed the camera at the top of the barrel like a first-person shooter in many of the action sequences. So I'm already saying I'm surprised this movie doesn't tie in to a video game. Seems like an obvious opportunity.<br /><br /> Extra Points Awarded for avoiding these clich&eacute;s ...<br /><br />1) One dimensional Characters. Each member of the Seal team was somewhat similar to each other and were all normal men. This eliminates broad character extremes like `The Angry/Gung-ho Soldier', `The Jokester', and `The Coward'. The Stern/Stoic Captain, `The Sensitive Journal Keeper', `The A-hole (who always lives), The Goodie (who dies) and `The Psycho'.<br /><br />2) The leader or captain who cares more about the men than the mission. *Probably not the guy you'd put in charge of a mission where saving his soldiers would mean the death of many more, usually including his men eventually.<br /><br />3) The General or commander who cares more about the mission than the soldiers, even when his disregard for their lives actually jeopardizes the mission.<br /><br />4) One super soldier killing an incredible amount of enemies- especially if he's about to die and also Act of Valor avoided weapons with unlimited ammo.<br /><br />5) Jar-head soldiers who only care about killing and getting laid. For once, it's not the girl back home; it's the wife and children back home. That adds a whole new dimension to what's being sacrificed by simply being active- way beyond just living and dying on a mission.<br /><br />6) Cursing to be `realistic'. There are professionals who have respect and a high regard for all the other branches so there was no slight to the other branches and the language was relatively clean.<br /><br /> The Atmosphere<br /><br />The soundtrack and sound effects are a highlight in this movie. I saw Drive by Nicolas Winding Refn starring Ryan Gosling and felt like the movie grabbed my stomach and wouldn't let it go until the end. I had a similar feeling with Act of Valor due to its near-perfect pacing and tense and suspenseful atmosphere. Side note: That great rap song used in the trailer does not appear in the movie (unless it's tacked on at the end of the credits) nor does it seem to be on the soundtrack. And from what I understand the soundtrack is comprised of country music. Surprising- since the instrumental music and incidental tones in the movie were epic and orchestral in nature.<br /><br />Politics is a small issue in Act of Valor. The burden of the bad guy falls on two characters. A smuggler names Christo and the old-school Jihad terrorist, Abu Shabal. The Russian Christo is given a bit of humanity by showing that he has some sensibility and sensitivity. The main terrorist Shabal is pretty much an animal for all intents and purposes and we never find out why or how he got to be that way (do you really care? Didn't think so). If you have strong feelings either way about US overseas policy, you know whether or not you should be seeing this film. Aside from that, it's not the job of any SEAL to figure out just how evil or justified the bad guy is. For most movies, you can put a names and faces on the enemy soldiers to let us know that war is bad and there are real people on the other end of those guns. Terrorists will not get any such treatment so do not include that as poor character development as a criticism of Act of Valor.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Act of valor and would recommend it to anyone who wants to a solid action movie that's heavy on the realism. If you want to see a more dramatic focus on the individual then I recommend The Hurt Locker. If you want to see more of a documentary, I suggest Restrepo.Nicolas Winding Refn starring Ryan Gosling and felt like the movie grabbed my stomach and wouldn't let it go until the end.

B000003TAR|5.0|This album is a very dark one. It shows a lot of emotion/anger. It's basically a shift away from all the fame gained from Nevermind. Kurt Cobain hated fame, this album is something I believe he created to just say \\"okay I'm famous, now what?\\". This album is filled with a lot of the \\"natural sound\\". It starts of great but then starts to get more intense, but then ends with a track \\"All Apologies\\" which is what I would say is a \\"goodbye\\" from Kurt.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|Harrison Ford (Star Wars Han Solo and Indiana Jones) plays Deckard; a burnt-out detective on a mission to hunt down and eliminate a dangerous group of androids (called Replicants) in a futuristic society that's rendered in a hauntingly realistic way. I assume you've seen this movie by now, so expect spoilers to be found throughout this review. Don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />Whenever I talk to my friends about movies, the question always comes up, what's your favorite movie? -or at least what's on your top ten list? Blade Runner has held a top position for many years, along with movies like 2001, Excalibur, Alien and of course Empire Strikes Back and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. I can pick many technical reasons for Blade Runner to hold the top position, from the way the special effects hold up decades later, the classic story or even the total believability of the world the characters inhabit.<br /><br />Creating a story is more than developing characters or building tension to a satisfying climax. Those elements are important, but we cannot overlook the importance of creating a living and breathing universe for the story to evolve in. Mad Max and its sequel The Road Warrior gave us a post-apocalyptic world that would influence countless films and honestly speaking, let many writers off the hook from the responsibility of creating any kind of world to surround their stage. You see the dessert, a few junked cars and you know what happened before the first day of the story. It's accepted that we'll all wear rags and sport Mohawk haircuts.<br /><br />Blade Runner did the same but in the opposite direction. Director Ridley Scott took the Phillip K Dick story and created a technically advanced society that was shiny at the top corporate level and yet dirty and depraved at the bottom. It feels like a proper translation of the 80s and it still feels right 30 years later. It's real to us because we can imagine ourselves living and operating in that world. It's real to us because we feel like if we live long enough we will live in that world.<br /><br />Sci-fi as a genre tends to be crippled by the weight of its gadgets, gimmicks and gizmos. Many writers rely on the tech/hardware to draw us in instead of our human flaws, emotions and inner drives. Most of these heroes did, well, nothing before the first day of filming. Blade Runner has many props- from the flying police car, zeppelin-sized flying billboards to androids that can pass themselves off as human-better than Arnuuld the Terminator. All of this nerd-candy does not take the place of good story-telling and characters that change and evolve as the story progresses.<br /><br />The music and soundtrack are flawless as Vangelis uses his synth-wizardry to merge the music and sound effects into a wonderful backdrop that never resorts to laser zaps to let us know we're in the future. The musical score reflects and reacts with each scene perfectly and always matches the on-screen tone.<br /><br />Romance works in movies when we all want the couple together by the end of the flick. Most movies simply throw them together enough and boom, you assume after all that adventuring, they just have to hook up. Cue the big kiss and roll the credits. Chemistry is easy to create when there is only one hot chick and one hero in the movie. Star Wars was faced with a crisis as fans were split between Luke and Han for Leia. Lucas chickened out and reached way too far and suddenly decided to make Luke and Leia brother and sister ->add another yuck for the kiss in Empire. When Deckard (Ford) meets Rachael, she is stunning and also way above his level of sophistication. When he sees her next, she is vulnerable and he blows it. Later, he reaches out to her and she blows him off. Boy loses girl. BUT! She comes to the rescue and now you can't imagine them NOT together. The chemistry works for me. I would want Rachael. Hell, I want Sean Young. While all of this is happening, you are not aware thattheir relationship is developing, no, you are too busy worrying about robots, guns and how this whole mess will get fixed.<br /><br />Bad guys are important too. Blade Runner uses the tried and true formula of a super-smart boss surrounded by not-so-smart henchmen. Certainly as simple as some of these extra characters are concerned, there are hints of additional history and relationships. If you note that Replicants are given false memories to create a cushion, Leon is carrying pictures of Zhora. Deckard found Zhora's snake's skin cell clue in the shower of  Leon's apartment. What does that tell you about the relationship between Leon and Zhora? And during her show, right before Deckard meets Zhora, you hear the host say \\"Watch her take the pleasure from the snake.\\" Which explains why she's tickled when Deckard questions if she's even been asked to do anything offensive by the management. Very funny. Rutger Hauer is at his best playing the leader and supremely dangerous Roy Batty. It adds more tension when you believe the bad guy can beat the good guy. He is also given the wonderful privilege of delivering the best lines/monologue in the entire movie.<br /><br /> Is Dekard a robot too?<br /><br />Ridley Scott assured Harrison Ford that he would not be playing an android since Ford thought a robot chasing a robot wouldn't be interesting to him. In subsequent versions of the movie, deleted scenes (the infamous unicorn running in the forest dream sequence) were added that left that question a mystery and open to debate.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is my favorite movie because it works for me on every level. It's a fine story wrapped in the fabric of Science Fiction.their relationship is developing, no, you are too busy worrying about robots, guns and how this whole mess will get fixed.<br /><br />Bad guys are important too.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Neat little game with great graphics. Controls work great. Very responsive. If you are looking to kill some time, this is the game to get. Plays great on my HTC Rezound and Kindle Fire.
0307352145|4.0|Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Won't Stop Talking covers a fairly wide range of topics (subject related, of course), ranging from societies \\"Extrovert Ideal\\", to how introverts and extroverts think differently, to the physical and psychological components and free will, to how to relate to those of the opposite personality type. Overall, all very relevant and useful topics to discuss.<br /><br />  Being an introvert myself, it was interesting to read Cain's breakdown of how introverts and extroverts think different, and how social situations affect each type differently. While the \\"Extrovert Ideal\\" is definitely prevalent in the world (or at least in the US...), I liked that Susan made the point that there needs to be a balanced compromise from both sides.<br /><br />  Also, I liked that the things Cain discussed were basic facts (or as far as I could tell, anyway), rather than being influenced one way or another by religious beliefs. I would be totally fine with reading a psychology/personality book from a Christian perspective, but I'll admit I most likely wouldn't be reading this type of book if it were strongly influenced by the world's view. However, Quiet didn't seem to bend either way. At one point Cain made a reference to God, and in another chapter used the term evolution. But even when she did say things like that, it didn't feel like she was swayed to one or the other. Long story short, I felt that this book was based primarily on researched facts, not religious or worldly views. The whole book is choc-full of interesting facts and research accounts--all told in a way that didn't weigh the reader down too much or lose the reader's interest.<br /><br />  I though Quiet was a very well written, informative, and useful resource for both introverts and extroverts, particularly in helping the two understand each other. Recommended. I received a free copy of this book from the publisher for this review. These opinions are my own; I was not required to write a positive review, nor was I compensated for this review.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this is krissy's review but it is perfect for the book and i totally agree i cant write a better one! kudos kris.<br /><br />I am not into BDSM stories, but I have to say that I really loved this one. This was one of those books that keeps you glued to the pages; staying up reading into the early morning. I found it to be very addicting which is really disturbing for me.<br /><br />This is the love story of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. Christian is such a complex character. You love him and hate him at the same time and it's really confusing. He's the ultimate alpha male, bad boy with a very dark and disturbing desire to inflict pain. He literally gets off on it. He meets and falls for Anastasia. When they meet she is an innocent college student and happens to still be a virgin. This is their love story and its deeply disturbing. Our boy Christian has some serious demons and its making Ana think long and hard about their relationship. This is not your typical boy meets girl let's date and fall in love romance. He wants to dominate her and he wants her submissive. He comes up with a contract that he wants her to sign. She's torn between her love for him and her fear of him. She wants to know why he is so Fifty Shades of \\"f'd\\" up. She wants to get to the bottom of what happened in his past to make him need this type of relationship and why he hates to be touched. He introduces her to the \\"dark side\\" of his sexual habits and in his desire to keep her and make her happy, tries for the \\"vanilla relationship\\" she desires. Will Ana embrace Christian's dark side or will it be more than she can handle? The way he makes love to her is so erotic, steamy, sexy and scary all at the same time.<br /><br />I know it does not sound like it, but there is a real love story there. Ana brings out feelings in Christian that he has never felt with anyone else. As crazy as it sounds, I have a lot of hope for these two and I am eager to read the next installment.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This was a amazing production of \\"The {Phamtom of the Opera\\" fot the 50th. anniversary. The Encore was also exceptional with past and present actors.I have other DVD's of the Phamton and without a doubt, this 50th anniversary production at the Royal Theatre is far the best.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|First of all, I want to say that the greatest strength of the third book was the biggest weakness of the first two books.  Collins finally developed the characters into well-rounded individuals.  The change that they went through was realistic and interesting.  And the best part about all of it is that this story really ends up having no hero.  Sure, we can all have our favorite characters, but the only heros are the ones who died in the telling of the story.<br /><br />And interestingly enough, my favorite character ended up being Peeta.  Perhaps that's because he's the one I can most relate to.  Perhaps that's because he's the one who perservered through the most horror and torment to finally becoming who he ended up being.  And at the end of the first book, I wanted him to die.  When a writer can develop a character that changes that much over the course of three books, and when we can see through his experiences why and how he changed, that is skill.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the story was that the ending was entirely too predictable.  I knew how everything was going to wrap up by the time I was a third of the way through the final book, and I was wrong on no accounts.  But perhaps the most disappointing of all is how Collins went through so much work to develop the kingdom of Panem, the rebellion of District 13, and the dynamics of the politics within it all.  But then we get no satisfaction in hearing how everything ended up.  What became of all of the districts?<br /><br />And finally, the climax really needs some work.  We're reading at a fevered frenzy, and all of a sudden a new chapter starts with poetic descriptions that go on for about 30 pages too long before the book ends.  There is some pretty good closure at the end, but boy, I sure would have liked to have read about how the main battle turned out.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I've had this app on Toshiba thrive for about six months.  No problems........till now with the last update on 4/10/12.  Still works fine but has annoying animated ads on the bottom.  Guess free was too good, had ta add something ta get lazy terds like me to take time to write reviews.  Well, that's it, I've spoken my mind now.  Wasn't that REAL INFORMATIVE!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The trilogy was recommended by my sister and once I started the first book I couldn't put them down. I read all three books in about 8 days! The are very easy to read and I found the characters very relatable. They do have a pretty erotic context, so would therefore not recommend them for the young or easily offended. But I found the characters and story very intriguing!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|well. I'm an angry bird geek. sorta. well maybe. okay anyway I really liked the new levles so kool!! :P
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm only level ten, but so far the gameplay is as addicting as it is simple. Way to go, Gameloft.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a fun game that is pretty much a knock off of Mario however, that's ok because its fun and helps time pass when ur bored. Exactly what I was lookin for :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is both fun and challenging enough to keep me playing. It's not only about finishing the puzzle but doing it efficiently. I recommend giving this game a shot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game love it if you are often board then get this game it will keep you occupied it definetely deserves 5 star reviews

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it its like mario it has the worlds the coins the little things that kill ya just like mario but only a little different
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|I really have to say I was very impressed with this production. The fact that after 25 years we FINALLY have a version of Phantom legally available for home viewing, and such a great version seems a miracle.<br /><br />The cast used for this production is great. Sierra Boggess was great as Christine, no complaints. Ramin Karmiloo is very good as Erik, though I feel he was a little too angry through most of the show, and in being so missed some of the more touching moments the character has to offer. The managers, Carlotta and Piangi were all well cast, and managed to hit their comedic moments just right, making them funny but not winking at the audience (as I've seen some do in the roles). Everyone has a fantastic voice, which instantly makes it a vast improvement over the movie.<br /><br />The disappointing aspect here is that they were not performing the show in a space which allowed them to actually stage the show as they would at Her Majesty's or the Majestic. Things that would normally rise up from the stage are pushed in from the sides. Things that would normally drop from the catwalks are instead digitally projected. For most of the show, only people who've seen the show live a few times will notice the difference (though the loss of the Hannibal elephant bit made me sad almost off the bat).<br /><br />Where this does become greatly disappointing is in regards to the chandelier. In any real production, the chandelier starts the show on the stage, only to rise up during the overture and hang above the audience. In this version, the Chandelier starts above the audience and doesn't move. There's one major problem with this- it's no secret the chandelier falls at the end of act one. This moment is completely gone, and instead Erik simply makes the chandelier blink and shoot sparks. It's incredibly sad and the most disappointing moment of an otherwise remarkably staged production.<br /><br />There's one other moment that I have to point out, because it bothered both my wife and I during our initial viewing, and has come to bother me even more in retrospect.<br /><br />In the live production Christine returns to Erik and gives him back his ring. He sings \\"Christine I love you\\" and she exits. We then she Christine and Raoul singing \\" All I Ask of You\\" as they cross the lake, while Erik looks on. It's a very sad moment and leads to Erik's final lines and the end of the show.<br /><br />In this production, however, Christine strangely stays and sings her solo portion of \\"All I Ask of You\\" to Erik. This makes very little sense in the grand concept of the show. Christine has just spent all of the last scene convincing Erik that she can not love him as he loves her, and pleading for him to let her leave with Raoul. Why would she stop and sing her love song to Erik? Dramatically it doesn't work and undercuts the entire ending. The moment feels absolutely forced and re-scripted from original presentation for the sole benefit of serving as the set-up to ALW's abominable sequel \\"Love Never Dies\\".<br /><br />Why re-stage a moment when it worked perfectly well to begin with?<br /><br />Anyway, my few complaints should not detract from grabbing this Blu Ray. It's a great production, but it must be said it's no substitute for seeing the show live. Even the best recording can not, under any circumstance, live up to seeing a show like this live.<br /><br />So, watch the DVD/Blu Ray to tide yourself over until a production comes to town, but don't buy it thinking that now you can save yourself the ticket price.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Its too bad this android app doesn't work like the iphone app. The other app you can earn back dollars by watching videos. You can also travel to other towns. I have not been able to earn dollars other than to spend money. No thanks. I also cant link to friends because the Live! thing doesn't seem to really work with the game. It 's just disappointing. Like some others reviews my animals don't replenish for like 210 hours.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun and addictive. Im going to buy the original game. hope it is as fun as this game is. you download while its free. or buy it when goes off the free list. Enjoy.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun game. Good way too kill time, keep your brain awake & work on problem solving skills. It appears to get more challenging as you go along.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book was enlightening in that factual evidence was presented to help explain the country's rapid<br />growth toward obesity through tricky marketing campaigns, disinformation, lack of clinical outcome testing for impact of hybridized wheat on the human body over the last 75 years and identification<br />of a large number of diseases or physical problems associated with the American diet.  A diet high in<br />refined wheat and other grains and the impact on blood chemistry, hormone production,gastrointestinal tract problems has denigrated our health  and the facts don't lie. You'll find the book a worthwhile read and if you try to limit these dangerous foods,  you will see results. The reality is that the government is seducing us to believe a low fat high grain diet is actually making us fat. I recommend you see for yourself.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|its a great app when it works worked awesome for a week now its glitching and houses wont reload so I can collect from them if its fixed ill rate a 5 but right now only worth a 2

B007N5YIUS|4.0|The Good: Gravity gameplay adds a new layer of depth, nice visuals, new birds are fun to use, lots of levels<br /><br />The Bad: May be harder for some, still hasn't evolved on the scale is should have<br /><br />Angry Birds, why are you so popular? Everyone plays this game and everyone who hasn't has at least heard of it. It was a digital phenomenon that sent a little indie game developer soaring into the millions. There is every type of merchandise available for a $1 game. Why is it so appealing to everyone? The game struck a perfect balance of hardcore perfection type gameplay and casual gamer fun. While Rovio put out a Seasons and Rio version of the game out the series was getting tiresome. Space adds a couple new layers of depth to the series.<br /><br />The game involves gravity play like you would expect. Yes, you are in space, and yes, the game plays differently. You flick your birds across space and try to get them sucked into the gravitational pull of planets where the usual obstacles and pigs lie. The added layer is that you can approach these puzzles at multiple angles. Have a bunch of blocks on one side of a pig? Flick your bird on the opposite side of the planet and watch it fly around using the pull of the planet and knock it down. As puzzles get harder multiple planets are lined up so trick shots are needed.<br /><br />The usual birds are back with a couple of new ones like the ice bird which freezes blocks so they shatter. The new gravity gameplay actually makes the environment a puzzle so it doesn't feel like the same type of puzzle over and over again. This also makes the game harder, so if you were afraid of that it came true. This actually makes the game more engaging and I could play in longer spurts because each puzzle felt really different. There is a new mode that is almost like a Space Invaders clone where you have to knock through aliens to get to the moving pig at the top. It's fun, but also hard to get to because these levels are hidden golden eggs throughout the game.<br /><br />Overall, Space adds a much-needed layer of depth using gravity and I like it a lot. I feel this game is geared more towards core gamers than casual, but both still apply here. There are hundreds of levels to start with, and obviously, more are coming. If you love Angry Birds then Space is an exciting and long-awaited sequel to a worldwide phenomenon.golden eggs throughout the game.<br /><br />Overall, Space adds a much-needed layer of depth using gravity and I like it a lot.

0765324857|4.0|The Good: Fills in the blanks in the first game, captures the atmosphere perfectly, everything in the game is in this book, a lot of questions answered from the game that couldn't have been otherwise<br /><br />The Bad: Ending feels a tad rushed, a little slow to start<br /><br />Rapture is a book that gets the novel translation perfect and all other games novels need to do. Rapture manages to used every single character, area, and even use word for word audio diaries from the game, and puts it into one cohesive narrative. The book starts off in 1945 with Andrew Ryan starting plans on building Rapture. The stories main protagonist is not Jack, but Bill McDonagh. He starts out as a plumber and Ryan plucks him up and has him help create Rapture. This all can be linked to the first game, and the whole book is just 100% spot on with everything.<br /><br />If you truly love the lore and setting of BioShock this is the book to read if you want to know what happened during certain audio diaries, why certain ones were made, and even just how the hell did this underwater city get created. The book spans 14 years leading right up to the beginning of the first game. The book actually has you following a whole civilization fall into despair and depression. Slowly everyone starts going insane on ADAM and EVE and Plasmids. You even get to know how those things were actually invented. You even get to see how security bots, turrets, and cameras came to be, and even Circus of Value vending machines get mentioned.<br /><br />The book does so much right that fans will just be shocked and awed about events playing out and will run through the game in their head and think, \\"So that's how that happened!\\". The book even made me go back and play through the whole game again just to link everything to the game. The book has the same insanity that the game does and you actually feel like you're in the game. The atmosphere is captured perfectly, and I don't think any other author could have done this game justice.<br /><br />If you truly love BioShock then pick this book up and enjoy every word. It's not often game get great true-to-heart novelizations like this, and I wish there were more like it. Instead of making a new story with the lore and characters, or even copying it, John Shirley takes everything in the game and fills in the blanks. That is probably the hardest challenge of all.one this game justice.<br /><br />If you truly love BioShock then pick this book up and enjoy every word.

B000RZOR2U|4.0|The Teldec Bach Cantata series under the joint direction of Harnoncourt and Leonhardt was the first complete Bach Cantata series featuring historically-informed performance practice--as it was understood in the period 1970-1985.  This series was not, in fact, the first complete cantata cycle--that honor goes to Helmuth Rilling, who utilized modern instruments, \\"conventional\\" mixed choirs, and standard operatic-oratorio soloists.  Unlike Rilling, the Harnoncourt-Leonhardt series excludes female voices entirely.  With the exception of the taxing Soprano solo cantatas BWV 51 and 199, all of the soprano arias are taken by boy choristers; and, of course, the choral ensembles rely entirely on boy sopranos and altos.  Those interpretive choices on the part of the two conductors give this pioneering effort its distinctive character and unique status among competing Bach cantata cycles (Leusink employs an all-male choir, but female soprano soloists).  In many ways, too, the Harnoncourt-Leonhardt series has historical value:  they *were* the first, after all, to stake out this territory for early music practitioners.  Though period instrumental and choral ensembles have improved beyond all recognition since Harnoncourt and Leonhardt recorded the final volume of their series, these two figures--and the forces they worked with--deserve all the honor we can give them for their collective \\"voyage of discovery\\"--even if it was a somewhat rocky one at times!<br /><br />As othe reviewers have noted, the ensemble playing and singing (under both conductors) can be rough, and those boy sopranos, with the best will in the world, can't compete in lung capacity, ability to sustain a line, or sing in tune, with adult vocalists.  That having been said, there is much to enjoy in this series; indeed, I keep coming back to it as a point of reference for appreciating and evaluating later cantata cycles.  Harnoncourt can be overemphatic and eccentric (much like Hermann Scherchen, under whom he played as a cellist in his younger days); yet none of the current Bach interpreters--not even Gardiner--convey the dramatic tensions and inwardness of these works better than Harnoncourt at his best.  Leonhardt, as one reviewer hinted, adopts a more laissez-faire posture, which can lead at times to a fatal slackness; yet at *his* best (which he is relatively less frequently than Harnoncourt), he can evoke the intimacy and charm of these works as well as any Bach interpreter past or present.<br /><br />The biggest asset to this series, however, is the superb team of adult soloists.  The contributions of such luminaries as Equiluz, van Egmond, Nimsgern, Esswood, Jacobs, Huttenlocher, and--latterly--Thomas Hampson, cnnot be gainsaid.  They are, on average, better than any of their competitors in more recent cantata cycles.  Compare, for instance, Esswood for Harnoncourt-Leonhardt and Robin Blaze for Suzuki and you'll hear a telling for instance of my general observation.<br /><br />The ensemble singing is, of course, more variable.  Diction can be mushy and textures confused.  But when these various all-male choirs were on their mettle, as they more often were, they produce a satisfyingly robust sound that carries well over the instrumental ensemble, even in the most richly orchestrated, \\"festive\\" cantatas.  Compare, once again, Suzuki's crack vocal group--whose diction, transparency of texture, and phrasing are nearly always impeccable--with the choirs in the Harnoncourt-Leonhardt series, and you will find that Suzuki's group is often covered by his instrumental ensemble, to the point that important fugal entrances are lost and contrapuntal detail generally doesn't emerge as clearly as it might.  Gardiner's Monteverdi Choir, is, of course, nonpareil, but I would say that the all-male choirs in the Teldec series give them some stiff competition in a number of works (such as the opening choruses, for instance, of BWV 101 and 102).<br /><br />I would also note that I applaud Harnoncourt's and Leonhardt's decision to restrict keyboard continuo to organ; the incessant jangling of the harpsichord, that one hears even in the most quiet, contemplative movements of some other cantata cycles (Rilling is the worst offender in this regard), amounts to something of a \\"pet peeve\\" for me.<br /><br />So what do I advise any prospective purchaser of a Bach cantata cycle to do?  You can't go too far wrong with any of them--even the Leusink cycle, often pilloried by critics, has its merits and should be considered (see my review of Leusink on this website).  For the latest in scholarship and impeccable musicianship, I would say that it has to be Suzuki--even though I do prefer a fuller choral sound (no Rifkin minimalist forces for this reviewer) and a richer-toned countertenor soloist than Robin Blaze.  Indeed, in many ways I prefer more traditional soloists, including female contraltos, as long as they don't overdo the vibrato.  For sheer chutzpah, and many unique insights, I would go with Gardiner's Bach Pilgrimage series; his cycle can boast the best choral singing, if not always the finest soloists.  Leusink has a certain chutzpah of his own, and a first-rate instrumental ensemble; his soloists, too, are not nearly as variable as they are made out to be in the critical press. The problem for Leusink is an undisciplined all-male choir that is frequently not up to the exigent demands Bach imposes on them.  Rilling will appeal to those who prefer modern instruments, traditional oratorio singers, and a middle-of-the-road approach that tries, and often succeeds, in bridging the gap between PPP and the old \\"Kapellmeister\\" tradition.  Harnoncourt-Leonhardt offer the excitement of discovery, and have the advantage of slower tempos than is the fashion today.  They have outstanding adult soloists working for them, all-male choirs that sing with far greater discipline than we might have expected, and charming, if vocally inelegant boy sopranos.<br /><br />I have heard only a few cantatas from Koopman's cycle, and thus am not qualified to comment on his work.<br /><br />A tentative--and somewhat reluctant--ranking, then, of the Bach cantata cycles known to me:  Suzuki, Gardiner, Rilling, Harnoncourt-Leonhardt, Leusink.  For earnest Bachians, I would add an imperative to acquire the best of the older Bach traditions represented by Richter, Werner, Prohaska, and others.  If price is an issue, then my ranking would shift accordingly:  Rilling, Leusink, Harnoncourt-Leonhardt, Gardiner, Suzuki.  And, finally, a ranking in order of recording quality:  Suzuki (despite the highly reverberant acoustic of the Kobe Shoin chapel); Harnoncourt-Leonhardt, Gardiner, Leusink, Rilling.<br /><br />Truly, we Bachians are spoiled for choice when it comes to the cantatas!<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  Since I wrote these lines, I have had the occasion to audition the one complete Bach cantata cycle with which I had been previously unfamiliar--namely, Ton Koopman's effort for Erato/Challenge Classics.  I had avoided Koopman's cycle for years largely because I have always disliked his style of organ playing--historical rectitude gone beserk, was (and largely still is) my reaction to his recordings of Bach organ music.  However, as I now realize, his cantata cycle is another matter.  His style, while close in many ways to his pupil, Maasaki Suzuki, is altogether more expressive, with shapelier phrasing (he does not avoid legato entirely) and a fuller appreciation for the sensuous beauty of Bach's seamlessly spun contrapuntal textures. Koopman also favors a more robust choral sonority that rarely gets drowned out by the instrumental ensemble (as happens quite frequently in about two-thirds of Suzuki's cycle). I also applaud his decision to assign a critical mass of the alto arias to female mezzo and contralto soloists rather than counter-tenors.  All of this adds up to a reappraisal of the tentative ranking given above.  I would now place Koopman'scantata series just slightly ahead of Suzuki.  Though there are inevitably ups and downs in a project of this scope, I find that Koopman's peaks are higher than anyone else's (at least in the HIP category), and his troughs fewer in number, though, regrettably, more numerous in the more intimate earlier cantatas from Arnstadt, M&uuml;hlhausen and Weimar, than in the great yearly cantata cycles from Leipzig (where he really shines).  However, there remains an irresistible exuberance, a sense of the joy of discovery, in every volume of Koopman's series. Of course Gardiner and Suzuki convey this quality as well, so my remarks are not to be interpreted as dismissing their entirely laudable efforts. It's not a matter of the best being an enemy of the good: It would be a logical fallacy to infer from a comparative judgment of value that the \\"less\\" valued is not also valuable.  That a is in some respects better than b, doesn't imply that b is bad or merits our disapproval.  Far from it, as comparing the relative virtues of Bach cantata cycles amply attests.>I have heard only a few cantatas from Koopman's cycle, and thus am not qualified to comment on his work.<br /><br />A tentative--and somewhat reluctant--ranking, then, of the Bach cantata cycles known to me:  Suzuki, Gardiner, Rilling, Harnoncourt-Leonhardt, Leusink.

0525423656|4.0|After the horrific ending of the first book, things aren't getting any easier for Cassia or Ky.<br /><br />  Cassia moves from city to city to work, hardly having any contact with anyone.  Her family is under the hopes that she will clean up her mess and come home.  Xander just wants her to be safe.  And Cassia has only a vague idea of where Ky is.<br /><br />  Ky is in the Outer Provinces, a place where no one survives.  He is too forced to work, but in worse conditions than Cassia.  He has a desire to leave the Outer Provinces, to go beyond them.  But he's not sure that's what he wants without Cassia.<br /><br />The real catalyst of the story is when Cassia boards a plane that will take her to the Outer Provinces, and quite possibly Ky.  Upon arriving, both characters undertake challenges neither of them expected.  And on top of that, they discover things about the government that could threaten the \\"peace\\" of the cities.<br /><br />So, why did I give it four stars?  Because while the characters did discover some key details, I felt like the story was going no where.  I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again.  There weren't enough problems thrown in their tracks-stuff I know that readers like to see.  Then again, it was good enough to give four stars.<br /><br />Big changes and I can hardly wait to see what the third book brings us.  Keep reading!

Just try each one once and you will see what each icon does, unless you are a total moron. By the way if you get SVOX and one of the SVOX voices for it you can use the text to speech feature in EZPDF without having to hear all the punctuation marks spoken out loud. There were only a couple of pdf apps that even had a text to speech option and they would speak the punctuation marks also. SVOX has a feature that lets you correct the pronunciation of words. Use it to set the , () [] : ; and whatever other punctuation you don't want to hear  to pronounce nothing and BINGO!!!, you will get a much better voice quality and no punctuation spoken. AWESOME! SVOX and one of their voices will run you about 3 bucks. Stop squeezing the eagle and buy it already!

B0059XTUVI|4.0|Movie biographies at the very best are highlights of a life. A film can't capture every nuance of a life, every pivotal moment that shapes a person, so we're left with the high and lows, a highlights reel of a life and \\"The Iron Lady\\" tries to capture pivotal moments in Margaret Thatcher's rise from grocers daughter to British Prime Minister.<br /><br />Told from the point of view of Thatcher (Meryl Streep) in her dotage carrying on conversations with her now deceased husband Denis Thatcher (Jim Broadbent), as she remembers an abbreviated youth, meeting Thatcher at a dinner where she is being vetted to run for a local office, and her quick rise during the 60's and 70's from a member of Parliament to Prime Minister. After she becomes Prime Minister the film really does seem to become a highlights clip of her political career, it does linger on the Falkland Islands war and her analogy to it being a British Pearl Harbor, but after that her tenure as Prime Minister seems to be on fast forward.<br /><br />Streep as Thatcher is almost invisible, some of it is the make-up to make her look in her 80's, but most of it is Streep's performance, as with any of the characters she's created from Sophie to Julia Child, Meryl Streep has the uncanny ability to channel and have the character inhabit her, and while some of those characters may resemble Streep, her characterization carries us away from recognition of the star and to recognition of the character.<br /><br />Special Features on the DVD include: Making of the Iron Lady, Recreating the Young Margaret Thatcher, Denis Thatcher the Man Behind the Woman, Battle in the House of Commons, Costume Design Pearls and Power Suits. All the special features except the Making of The Iron Lady are excerpts from the film and don't add any insight into their subjects.

0307352145|4.0|When I began reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, I thought, frankly, that Susan Cain was preaching to the choir.  Who but introverts would want to read a book in praise of introverts?  The stage is set with an account of our transformation in America from a \\"Culture of Character,\\" featuring honor and discipline as prized traits, to a \\"Culture of Personality,\\" in which boldness and ability to entertain became our focus.  Cain asks, \\"[H]ow did we go from Character to Personality without realizing that we had sacrificed something meaningful along the way?\\"    Sounds like we're about to spend the next 230 pages bashing extroverts*, doesn't it?  I thought so, too, and I was not prepared to go along with it.  I'm an introvert myself, and have an introverted son, but I'm married to an extrovert, and two of our children are extroverts.  (The jury's still out on our 3-year-old.)  I was not interested in an anti-extrovert treatise.  However, Cain won me over with her careful attention to the positive traits that both introverts and extroverts bring to work, social, religious, and educational settings.  While extroverts enjoy a cultural bias in the United States, Cain doesn't discount their strengths here, but merely seeks to carve out an equally positive place for introverts to showcase their more quiet strengths.  Indeed, her argument is that any given group needs both skill sets to flourish.    Leaders of churches, schools, companies, and community groups would benefit from implementing the tips Cain shares on how to welcome and nurture the introverts among them.  Estimating introvert population at 1/3 to 1/2 of Americans, there is a significant percentage of people in all those settings whose gifts may be underdeveloped or at least underused.    From the perspective of a frequent expatriate, I found it helpful to read Cain's reminder that not every country is culturally biased towards extroverts.  The diplomatic and economic ramifications of understanding that and accommodating both temperaments could be remarkable.    But from a parent's point of view, I feel that Cain's suggestions are vital to any extrovert parenting an introvert or introvert parenting an extrovert.  Understanding the validity and potential of your child's personality can move your relationship away from well-meaning but stifling criticism into a healthier direction.    One final note: My 7-year-old, seeing that I was reading Quiet, wanted to know where our family members fell on the spectrum.  Daddy - extrovert.  Mommy - introvert.  Biggest brother - extrovert.  Big brother - introvert.  She herself - extrovert.  She felt terrible that our 3-year-old was left out, so she tenderly asked her, \\"Little girl, would you rather have fun or be alone?\\"  Good thing I just read Quiet.  Now I can show my little extrovert how to do both.    *Cain deliberately spells it with the layman's spelling of \\"extrovert\\" rather than the research-based \\"extravert,\\" and I duplicate that in this review.    I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.    [...]

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Many years ago, I read every Stephen King book the second it was published, and I collected them all. Then he went through a 'phase' where everything he wrote, I thought was crap. And though it was a difficult decision to make, because I was pretty devoted to my fandom and my collection, I eventually gave up, got rid of all the books (except maybe The Stand, think I kept that one), and swore off SK.<br /><br />A few weeks ago my brother gave me this book, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Wow. This is absolutely one of the best books I've read in a long while. He's back in fine fetter. (actually, to be fair, he may have been back in fine fetter for quite some time and I wouldn't have known, as I wasn't reading his stuff).<br /><br />This is a compelling book that it was very hard to put down. The characters are everyone you ever knew, including sometimes you (classic Stephen King), and you will love them, cheer them on, on the edge of your seat; hate a couple of them (\\"those\\" people); cry with them; and feel a deep, deep sense of satisfaction at the end of the book. The ending - always an important consideration (no spoilers!) - is fantastic. You don't know for sure what's coming, in fact it's easy to think, \\"How in the heck is he going to handle THIS?\\" - so you're surprised; it's poignant and complete. When I closed the book tonight, I felt a deep sense of satisfaction. I know I said that already, but it's the best way I know to describe it. The best literary entertainment I've had for a long time.<br /><br />Great book. Highly recommended.

Basically you have 3 different kingdoms competing to gain even more power, after one of their kings unexpectedly dies.<br /><br />Politics, alliances, brutality, power-lust, and simple lust and shown in full force here.  Just as HBO did with its \\"Rome\\" series showing the underbelly of the Roman Empire, so too here we see a mythical medieval realm similar to Lord of the Rings (as least in production design).  But instead of people trying to capture a ring for power, here they do it the old fashioned way, by butchering their enemies, in many novel ways.<br /><br />LOTR alum, Sean Bean, here in perhaps the role he was born to play is brillant; as is the rest of the cast (which is well-cast).  There are many intriguing plot lines that play out, so you the viewer are constantly trying to figure them out to see where they will lead.  In other words, the writing is really good.<br /><br />I've only seen the first handful of episodes, but having seen enough to offer this brief review to HIGHLY recommend it.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Great app! I love this app! Use it all the time! It is an app that lets me have fun while on it.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|Fun, but NOT durable.  We were at a play date where this was the favorite, prized possession of an well-behaved 18 mo old little girl.  Unfortunately, while it was perfect for her and my 18 month-old little girl, it could not stand up to my boys (4 and 6 years old).  Granted, they're your typical crazy boys, but imagine how sad it was when they popped her toy.  Needless to say, the only right thing to do was buy her a new one.  I DON'T recommend that you put yourself or your friends in the same situation.  The whole side ripped away, there was no way to fix it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its very cute and i love it!!!!  i only stopped playing to write my review.  so i love the game its kinda like mario brothers!
B005HS00V4|3.0|I was truly excited to get this on blu-ray. Loved when Portishead did it in NYC. I have seen Mr. Gabriel live(Secret Wold tour) and was one of the best shows I've ever been to. The video for Secret World, always felt  over-produced(to me) and did not capture the scope of the whole stage. New Blood, sounds amazing, great takes on classic Gabriel songs. That being said, I don't know if Pete is to blame or the director, but it is filled with gimmicky shots, silly close-ups, and very little pulled back shots showing the whole stage and orchestra. There was also a great digital backdrop(saw it used better by nine inch nails) but still very cool....if they would pull back and show it to you. Note to artists, set a camera center stage, half_way back, and just film.Make it an option for those of us who don't like the gimmicks, but appreciate the theatrics, and less is more approach. I give the audio 5 out of 5. Film, 2 out of 5. Just buy it, put it in, and light some candles, and turn the TV off!!!<br /><br />P.S. I am sure Peter's daughter is a nice young lady, but we need a better female back-up for Peter.
B001BANK32|5.0|A little backstory: I recently decided to read King's entire library in chronological order in an attempt to better understand the horror genre on a whole by the understanding the works of the man who most helped shape modern horror.<br /><br />I'll admit it, I was fairly worried about this one. King's greatest asset seems to be his ability to make the mundane interesting, especially the small, New England town. In 'Salem's Lot and Under the Dome, the most compelling character seemed to be the town itself.<br /><br />But then we have The Shining, which features no more than three characters in the middle nowhere. Truly, I knew that King would be put to the test to make this one readable, let alone great.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I think I can say that this is the first legitimately frightening book I have ever read. I've read horror in my time, a fair amount, but none of it really scared me. I could appreciate the terror the characters were feeling, the severity of their situations, but only on an academic level.<br /><br />The Shining upped the ante. Possibly the most frightening scene was the first incident with the hedge animals. It made me nervous in a way words had yet to, and I've been reading for the better part of sixteen years. The Shining was as close as I've come to a page-turner in a long time. It gave me trouble sleeping.<br /><br />I knew the book had a lot of potential. King said, in his introduction, that, while he wasn't aware of it at the time, The Shining had the ability to be a milestone of a book for him, a new plateau, and he was glad that it became that. It made him a better author. The book is a grim, hard slog through desperate insanity, evil of a unique sort and despairing isolation.<br /><br />What made the book so compelling, to me at least, was the portrayal of the path to insanity. The main character had some screws loose at the beginning of the book, but he was still playing with a full deck. I haven't seen the movie, but living in our culture, it's hard not to know certain events that occur in the book. I knew he would lose it. The biggest achievement of this book is the subtle, malignant decay that so ensnares Jack Torrance's mind, and the almost imperceptible way he begins to lose it.<br /><br />This novel is a testament to the horror genre and just how good it can get.<br /><br />Now, on to Rage.ie, but living in our culture, it's hard not to know certain events that occur in the book.
