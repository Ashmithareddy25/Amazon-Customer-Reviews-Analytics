B000FQ4M58|5.0|I have every record ever released by Meat, including the original with Stoney.  Some albums are world class, some are average and a couple are consigned very quickly to the back of the drawer. <br /> <br />Bat 1 is out on its own.  I prefer \\"Dead Ringer\\" to Bat 2.  I definitely prefer Bat 3 to Bat 2.   <br /> <br />Why.  I think the songs are more varied and less designed for the mass market.  I am a huge fan of Steinman, but like most songwriters they dry up eventually.  To me the best songs on the album are not all Steinman's.  In fact the worst song to these ears is \\"If it aint broke\\".  <br /> <br />Child has captured the essence of Steinman production and added more variety in tone.   I think the use of the musicians is also some of the best Meat has managed.  The drumming is more intricate and off-beat than any since \\"I'm going to love her for both of us\\" and the guitars wrestle beautifully. <br /> <br />The opening track (Monster) is probably Meat's hardest rock track since a couple of outings on Ted Nugents 1976 \\"Free for all\\".   In fact this whole album is \\"angry\\" or at least \\"reflective\\".   <br /> <br />Yes a number of track are new versions of pre-recorded songs.  But so what.  Meat is not the first person to re-record old songs, but he appears to be the first to take such flack over it.  I don't particularly like \\"It's all coming back to me\\" but that is because it not one of the more powerful songs on the album not because it has been released before. <br /> <br />The songs all hold well together.  And they seem to be about how life has not been as rosy as one might have imagined as a teenager 30 years ago.  They look at the dark side.  I love the fact that in a couple of songs there are specific references to the \\"dreams\\" of the past.  For those of us who have been through 30 years with Meat we can relate to how dreams come but sometimes get shattered.   <br /> <br />The key for me is that in this album more than anything since Bat 2 Meat believes what he is singing.  You can hear every fibre of who he is in every song - and that to me is the key to any great album.  Whether it is Prince, Springsteen, Elvis or even Pink.  Do they believe and does it come through.  And in this album it comes through loud (very loud) and clear. <br /> <br />If you are a genuine Meat fan then buy the album.  If you hate Meat then don't bother.  If you like some of his stuff or are new to this - then give it a go - I suspect you will be delighted. <br /> <br />Pay for the neighbours to go out for the evening, turn down the lights, close all the doors and windows, get out your air guitar, air drums and air microphone, turn the volume to max and for an hour and a quarter imagine it is you at the Garden. <br /> <br />

B000EWBNMS|5.0|Medium is a show about a \\"True\\" psychic detective, Allison Dubois.<br />The show is pretty good drama, with a mostly excellent cast.<br /><br />The amazing performance of Patricia Arquette is completely believable, as the self doubting psychic, coming to terms with her abilities, dealing with a dolt of a rocket scientist husband, (who's skepticism is the most unbelievable aspect of the series), three precocious daughters who are beginning to show their mother's talents, a boss with ambivalent belief/dependency on her abilities, a wise cracking detective, and a host of evil doers, and annoying ghost.<br /><br />The whole point of her job is to help the DA catch some very, evil baddies, and most of the crimes are not appropriate for pre-teenagers, (which is why the show is on so late at night), so view the discs before watching with younger kids.<br /><br />The disc set has interesting extras such as meet the real Allison Dubois, to let you kind of make up your mind how much of the show to take seriously..<br />If you like crime dramas, this should be a good show for you.<br />If you like supernatural shows, this should be a good show for you.<br /><br />And as an update...<br />The third season is even better than the first two, with all the characters getting better & better as finally the character of Joe is developed, sympathetic, and believable.

B00005JKHP|4.0|It's more fun to watch with some age on it. The updates on the effects and editing make it flow better. Like watching a 2hr episode from the original series.
B000002PCS|5.0|Loved the movie and have it on DVD. So the soundtrack seemed logical have. <br /> The \\"Rhapsody On A Theme of Paginini\\" by Rachmaninoff is superb and the main title is beautifully haunting.

0316172324|4.0|Blink is about trascending what we think we know and trusting our inner self. It's about realising that we take our life's most important decisions in an instant, in a blink of an eye.<br /><br />Whenever we meet a new person, in fact, we acknowledge and decide we like or dislike him/her in less than 5 seconds. In that very moment, we are entirely guided by our unconscious and if only did we learn to listen to our purest, most recondite emotions, we would not be so surprised to discover, at a later stage, that what we thought of something or someone was not exactly right.<br /><br />So many of our decisions are driven by the passionate desire to find a feasible solution, a hint, an answer. Yet, the more we dwell into the process of decision-making, the more we risk to make the wrong choice.<br /><br />Blink revolutionises the worldly wisdom that invites people to sleep over a problem before trying and face it. All in all, Malcolm Gladwell invites us not to think... At least, not the way we are used to, but start relying on and embracing the beautiful, infinate possibilities of our mind.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Thunder on the Mountain and Workingman Blues - excellent. This album is reminiscent of Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly. very enjoyable. Thank you, Mr. Dylan for a good old fashioned toe tapper.
B000003C5C|5.0|The second installment of Chuck Schuldiner's group DEATH entitled LEPROSY is nothing short of amazing.  The songs deal with several issues as pertinent then as they are today . \\"Born dead\\" explores abortion and \\"Pull the plug\\" explores the right of a person to terminate his or her own life. Incidentally these have been hotly debated  issues during he mid term campaigns in the USA. Pro Life...Pro choice.Eusthanasia...  Mr Schuldiner had an opinion about each and all of them. The musicianship is not as tight as the following releases but the solos are still mind blowing. Production is very good and all those seeking for clasic Death Metal will see their cravings very well satisfied. It is only too bad that Chuck Schuldiner is not with us anymore after a long and valiant battle with cancer.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I really liked the film, in fact, I've seen it twice (The Day After). It was a wake up call but I wished it was a little longer and showed how life would be after a certain amount of years and what (if anything) would survive. I'm glad I purchased it.
0307346609|5.0|Written in a very interesting style--definitely recommended for those who liked \\"Zombie Survival Guide\\".
0618680004|1.0|Professor Dawkins is a brilliant biologist, and his theory of cultural evolution on Darwinian lines is a fascinating and persuasive hypothesis, although it is linguistically flawed (with respect to the neologism \\"meme\\"). His arguments against religious belief are also sound, and obviously right. But they will not persuade believers whose minds are impervious to reason. He should leave such fruitless advocacy to lesser minds, like that of Mr Harris, and devote himself to giving us a more detailed theory of cultural evolution, with examples.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|This film is an underrated classic. The suspense it builds is so creepy. It has probably THE most crazy psycho in film history. The actors are all good and believable. This and Superman are Margot Kidder's best films. The most original ending for a slasher film I've ever seen. The picture still has some grain. It should have been restored or at least remastered in THX. Look how good \\"Halloween\\" and other old, low budget films from the time look on dvd. However, at least it's finally in anamorphic widescreen which is great. The new 5.1 surround really improves the film although it seemed a little on the quiet end, so I turned it up a little louder than usual. I heard musical details and dialogue I'd never noticed before, it made it creepier. The interviews on this dvd again suffer from some poor audio, as in previous dvd versions. It's hard to hear the questions the interviewer is asking, but otherwise the new interviews were great. The 2 scenes with a different sound mix were no big deal. I wish it had a commentary(preferably a new one, and not a recycling from previous releases), trailer, and was subtitled for dialogue that's hard to understand. Alas, this is the best presentation of the film on dvd so far and definately worth buying if you're a hardcore fan. I give 5 stars for the film and 3 stars for this dvd version, 2 stars for the previous collector's edition, and 1 star for the first dvd version(25th Anniversary edition). There will probably be at least 2 more versions before they FINALLY get it right
6305657947|5.0|\\"Do you want to dance, or Do you want to DANCE\\". Favorite Movie, favorit music. Hot, hot, hot. Intellectually, Visually...Nice to see two characters who are so perfect together. Many times in movies I never understand the attraction or connection. But in this movie it is obvious. That is what I love about it. Two people finding the perfect person for them. The intrigue and fantasy features a plus. Take me to that island anyday and with Pierce Brosnan..oh yeah! The Art...the music and two very HOT people..Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This documentary blew my mind so much that my husband and I watched it more than once- something we NEVER do.  I liked it so myuch I sent it to my father and mother who had definate opinions of McNamara and the war and this completely changed the way they saw everything.  My father is a war veteran and a buff of this kind of thing and even he learned a lot from it.  Fantastic movie.  Must see.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|For all of you Veronica fans worried the show wouldn't be able to repeat the drama, comedy, and intrigue of the first season, worry no more. Season 2 has another huge mystery that doesn't get resolved until the final minutes, and still is filled with other smaller cases that are just as interesting. The cast is brilliant once again. If you loved the first season, you will have a hard time not watching one episode after another of this one.
6304712499|3.0|The movie could have been done so much more to capture the actual comic. The setup of the main character, plot, and ending all were lacking. Spawn was a great comic and this movie just couldn't give it justice. That said, the movie was okay, I am sure the budget wasn't big enough. Decent movie, just wish the director for batman begins was doing the job.
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo and Stitch is an animated movie that emphasizes the importance of family.  All of us lose loved ones at some point in time during our lifetimes, and we all face those solemn feelings of despair and loss that accompany the passing of ones we hold dear.  I did not expect to encounter such a powerful message when I put the DVD of a \\"cartoon\\" into my player and began to watch, but that's what happened with this movie as it unfolded and told the story of two sister's striving to keep their little family together. <br /> <br />Mahalo, <br />Adam Platts <br />

0143036556|5.0|For a comprehensive course in human impacts on ecology, this is a great read.  Even for someone fairly well-educated about environmental issues, I felt it gave me a better ability to defend a pro-environmental position with clear logic and detailed examples.    <br /> <br />The historical examples give the sort of detail that we all really need to look at.  That is the major selling point for this book.  Some people want to look the other way on environmental issues and say that humans have always used their ingenuity to solve problems--but Diamond provides numerous examples of how this attitude has lead to the complete Collapse of a society.  In a time when some of the first \\"Resource Wars\\" are already being fought over oil, land, and food, this book is important reading for anyone who wants to keep this planet viable for human existence.   <br /> <br />As with \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" it is very information-dense.  It may be somewhat inaccessible to some readers who would otherwise really benefit from getting this information.  The major ideas in Diamond's books could easily be conveyed in a Cliff Notes--you'd get the take-home message nearly as well as if you'd read the book--but it's the historical examples that really make the book.  If you liked \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" you'll really enjoy it.
B00005JNS0|3.0|Maybe it's me.  I bought this DVD, enhanced for 16 X 9 televisions, and I am less than happy.  All other previous Disney/Pixar movies filled up the screen on my set....this one gives me black bars.  I also have to go into the audio set up menu every time to select the Dolby Digital 5.1 option....I didn't have to do that on their other movies.  The movie is great, but the execution/delivery of the DVD is sub-par at best.

B000FIMG68|5.0|My daughter was really happy with this purchase.  We enjoy ordering thru Amazon. Always great service.
B000002VC5|5.0|Alan Parsons' claim to fame is probably a tossup between producing Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon, one of rock music's defining albums, and his own impressive catalog under the somewhat deceptive title of Alan Parsons Project (this was more than a bunch of session buddies getting together).  Among the Project albums, I Robot is arguably the most original and fully realized.  With an all star cast of talent, it couldn't help but be successful and stands as one of the more if not most significant rock albums of the late seventies.  Every song is insidiously memorable and the album as a whole flows beautifully from beginning to end.  Parsons followed this formula on subsequent albums with mixed results.  For better or worse, they tended toward predictability even if they were still immensely enjoyable (The Turn of a Friendly Card and Eye in the Sky are excellent albums), but I Robot had the advantage of taking everyone by surprise as did Pink Floyd's masterpiece.  On that level it's hard to separate the two.  If you own one of them, chances are you own the other.  If not, you should.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Fast shipping, and arrived in great condition, I am extremely content with my purchase.
B000FIMG68|4.0|Rather than watch each week, buying the compilation and shipping to UK allows a feast of three episodes per viewing before exhaustion takes over. And stops one building a love hate attitude to the nonsense this programme can be if watched week by week. <br />Why do I watch? Now out of intellectual curiosity at how much fun the team are having in making it up as they go along. But oh for a Steve Boccho to put some spice and black humour into a still immature, taking themselves a little too seriously, team of writers and directors.

B000026I8U|4.0|This album, in every sense of the word 'album', is great.  I saw Manu Chao live in Chicago, Summer of '06, and was blown away.  Clandestino was a great introduction to a studio album by Manu Chao for me.  The songs link together when listened to on CD that is reminiscent of the way Beatles albums were put together.  If you are looking for an album to remind you of travel and adventure away from where you might currently be, this is the one!
B000002UCN|5.0|George is so versatile.  I like all his music--even the stuff that didn't get played on the radio a lot.  \\"Something\\" is definitely my favorite Harrison tune.  My teenage daughter has discovered this CD and LOVES \\"Give me Love\\" and \\"What is Life\\".  I can hardly keep this in my car, she keeps borrowing it. Guess it's time to buy another one so we can both listen!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is truly my all time favorite movie.  It's a story about an ordinary man who works hard all his life, giving up his dreams to help others.  When all of a sudden, some disagreeable things start to happen to him(serious things), and it appears he will be disgraced in front of his family, friends, and the whole town, and through no fault of his own.  So he gets desperate and considers suicide.  Just as he's about to do the deed, an unlikely looking angel, named Clarence, shows up to help him.  Since the man thinks his life has so little value, Clarence decides to show the man just how much his life really matters--WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF THE MAN HAD NEVER BEEN BORN.  In effect, the man had a tremendous effect on the lives of so many others.  I don't want to tell you too much, because I want you to see the movie \\"fresh\\" if you've never seen it.<br /><br />Forget the fact that this is a Christmas classic, a fantastic story & script, and is chocked full of fine actors, like the incredible Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, and others.  The most awesome part of this movie to me is the concept that each life touches so many others, and in ways you would never even think of most of the time.  We never stop to think that the stranger, or friend, or co-worker we said a kind word to, or smiled at today, might have undergone such incredible pain, and we just helped them out.  This movie reinforces the idea that doing kind deeds for others can make a profound difference in their lives.<br /><br />That's why I love this movie so much.  You will probably never know the difference you've made in the lives of most.  I've been fortunate enough to have a few people come back to me and remind me of some simple little nothing things I did for them that positively affected their lives.  Most of those things, I didn't even remember doing!I actually remember a lady I helped who said she was considering suicide.  Was she serious?  I hope not, but she said she was.<br /><br />So, are you trying to make the world a little better as you travel your path?  You don't have to be Mother Theresa to make a difference.  Just making someone laugh today can be a big deal to them, especially if things are really bad for them right now. After all, laughter is the medicine of the angels.<br /><br />So, if you've never seen this movie, GET IT!  Watch it and discover a very profound message within the movie--What difference am I making?  Is anyone's life different because I was born?  Then reassess.  If you have seen this movie, buy it anyway, and watch it at least once a year at Christmastime to remind yourself of this concept, to make a positive difference in the world.<br /><br />More than ever before, WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS NOW IS LOVE, SWEET LOVE!<br />Feel it, breathe it, make it a part of your life! Do unto others as you would have done unto you.<br /><br />God bless you.little better as you travel your path?  You don't have to be Mother Theresa to make a difference.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is a major record in the history of rock and roll, a must have in every decent record collection. If you don't have it, buy it now. Excellent mix of reggue bits, like the guns of brixton, with some great punk rock like the very same london calling. Music, lyrics, all is good in this record. <br />Este es un disco fundamental en la historia del rock, algo que debe estar presente en cualquier colección más o menos decente. Una excelente mezcla entre reggue como guns of brixton y punk como el mismisimo london calling. Ambos ritmos (regue y punk) tienen muchos puntos de contacto en cuanto política, contenido y actitud, así que esta mezcla (como en the police) era algo que naturalmente debia suceder. Este disco por tanto representa sociológica y musicalemnte una fotografía de un momento histórico. Compralo, escuchalo, disfrutalo y recomiendaselo a quien más cariño le tangas!
B000GRTQSE|5.0|From the start this recording sets an ambitious pace, with Thunder on the Mountain.  While the slower ballads give one a chance to catch your breath, they are full of deep insight and dry wit. <br /> <br />There are several classic, re-worked blues standards that are anything but standard after Dylans treament (Rolling & Tumblin, Someday Baby). <br /> <br />The added DVD performaces likewise are a gift--with the closer, Cold Irons Bound, offering a strong group performance so grand that even the dead pan Dylan has to almost break a smile.  This version of Cold Irons Bound is a seriously upbeat revitalization of the original release.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|I stepped back from listening to John because I felt like he got away from what made his music so sucessful.  This is the first \\"album\\" he has made that I feel is a bend back to what he does best, in my humble opinion.  This is a wonderful CD, thanks!
B00004VVNB|5.0|I have always loved this movie but it was very hard to find. It is such a relief to have a place to find rare movies in such great condition.  This movie will make you really think about the future and also about how far our movie technology has come.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love this show and I love this box set.  I was not able to watch all of season one, when the episodes first aired, so it was great to be able to watch them on dvd and get ready for the new season.  This has really great special featurees as well (Bloopers, behind the scenes).  It is a great set, and I am happy that I bought it.  Now I can see Jensen Ackles anytime I want. :)
B0006B2A2E|5.0|A real achievement. I've been a fan of Gondry's from his music video work- but this film is a whole order of magnitude different. The most heartfelt of any of Kaufman's scripts- which tend to be sort of cruel and unrelenting at times despite their structural brilliance. Not a Jim Carrey fan either but he's wonderful as is always kate Winslet. One the best things aside fromt he lush visuals (particularly as their dreamword begins to decay) is the special features, which outline the stunningly simplistic use of camera tricks to achieve such innovative effects without leaning too much upon the convolutions of CGI technology. Absolutely one of my all time favorite films.
B000000OF6|4.0|Everyone that likes this type of music should have a copy of this CD.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Great visual of the battle where my great grandfather fought with the 6th SC.  Entertaining and educational.
014028009X|5.0|I bought this book eventhough I own the dvd because the movie was fantastic and absolutly hilarious. Bridget Jones's Diary (the book) is equally as funny, it differs slightly from the movie but not too much, this works well because it adds new scenes and information into the story and life of Bridget Jones. It's a very well written, quick read that will remain on my bookshelf for a very long time. I recommend it to all!
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen even when there isn't a love scene.  Of course Johnny Depp makes the romance wonderful.
B00005JKDR|2.0|Delighted to recieve it. Found it very entertaining and the my child loves it, never stops watching it, would recommened it to any one looking to buy a loved one a dvd for Xmas.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The Second Season of Lost DVD, help me find more clues about this show, and it was also needed for the rest of my family to catch up on the show.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|One of the best series I have seen.  Enjoyed it even more than the BBC Pride and Prejudice.  When Ms. Hale (Daniela Densby-Ashe) enters into the Malbury Mills, it is a classic moment of 19th century industrialization caught in a snapshot as she sees the cotton fibers floating through the air like snow.  Absolutely brilliant cinematography.  And the chemistry between the actors makes it one of the most endearing stories put on film.  Absolutely outstanding.

B0000028WD|5.0|If you like Bob Dylan music, then you will love this cd as it's 30 of his best songs done by various artists in there own styles and it's great. The fact that it is a live concert makes it even better and real and Bob Dylan also does a couple of songs at the end of the concert as well which of course are also great. I think actually there is a little something for everyone in this live 2cd set.
B000FIMG68|5.0|What can I say Lost is GOOD, Im hooked.I have also gotten a lot of people hooked on lost season three from watching my season one and two. I highly recommend picking them up. Lost is like that good book you just can't put down, because you have no idea what going to happen next.
0930289528|3.0|Graphic Novel. Plot is similar to the movie of the same name, however there is greater depth and significant changes in the particulars of the story as well as several digressions that occur in the graphic novel but not in the movie. I prefer the movie based on shere entertainment value, but it is interesting to see where the idea had originated. It is mildly disturbing, many of the scenes are very in-your-face and theoretically provocative. The basic premise brings you into the underground resistance, lead by the character \\"V,\\" against a totalitarian empire that had taken over England following a devestating catastrophe. In the movie, it was disease and threat of war; in the comic, I was less certain of exactly what had brought about the rise of the iron-handed state. All the same, it is the story of how this figure, \\"V,\\" effectively turns this totalitarian state upside down and eventually makes it crumble. The artwork is artistic without being cartoonish, it is meant for a mature audience and deals with serious and mature subject matter in a slightly fanciful manner.

B000G759LW|5.0|Like a reviewer before me, I am 40 and this is my first and so far only Aguilera CD I've bought.<br /><br />Love it, love it, love it, love it!<br /><br />I live in Memphis, a town with a VERY rich musical heritage -- soul, funk, R&B, blues, rock, etc.  And on this CD Aguilera pays homage to a great deal of the best of that heritage, albeit with a decidely modern twist.  Heck, even some of the piano phrasing in one tune sounds like it could have been lifted from \\"Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano\\" (1978).<br /><br />Buy this CD.  Trust me on this.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Bought for my husband, he loves it. Very well done movie.  Violence abounds, so not for the faint of heart.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The first concert that I ever attended was a pink floyd 'concert'at  the electric factory (which at the time was a former tire factory),on market st. in Philly in the mid seventies, or somewhere around there.Having been almost knee to knee with Roger Waters for the duration of about two hours, I had been converted. I saw them almost every time they came to Philly, including the concert where the fans dispensed with fences and swarmed into the arena - but who could blame them?<br /><br />Pulse is the best music/light show concert that you will ever see.<br /><br />Everything is perfect - the lasers are gorgeous, the effects and movies are simply stunning, fresh and innocent. Wenright displays his guitar godhood on this video beautifully. Imagine what a genius Gilmour is, and then imagine who he would hire for a guitarist - the guy would have to be pretty good, wouldn't he? For me, this concert crystalized everything that was good about progressive rock up to that time, and still hasn't been surpassed or even equaled.<br /><br />The quality of the DVD is exceptionally crisp, the sound amazing.<br /><br />If you love the floyd, you probably already have this.
0761944524|5.0|The title of this book does not reflect its nature; instead of an academic dry exercise book, the reader will find an easy, funny reading (with no lost in substance). Andy Field writes the book just as a good lecturer speaks in a class. He has a simple and special style.<br /><br />The book helped me a lot in two complicated courses in my M.Sc. in Operations Research and Decisions: \\"Multi Variate Forecasting and Inference\\" and \\"Data Analysis in Marketing\\". The author presents excellent day-to-day weird examples to explain how to develop statistical analysis in SPSS. He explains meticulously a very wide range of statistical terms and links them to SPSS actions.<br /><br />The content of the book is very organized: to those who want to read it from beginning to end as well as to those who only wish to consult it for specific subjects. The chapters are graded by difficulty degree and importance, and at the end of each chapter you will find a comprehensive review of the most important topics.<br /><br />Very useful and well written book.

Great entertainment.
B000FGGE68|5.0|I saw the edited version at theaters and LOVE IT, a well managed sci-fi futuristic movie based on a female superhero. <br /> <br />The plot is well written, which locates us on a future with very advanced technologies and a war against the government and a rebel group. <br /> <br />The visual FX are state-of-the art and the action sequences are well done !!! <br /> <br />This extended version is worth for that 7 extra minutes, which are not more but they are very precise in giving more strength to the plot. <br /> <br />Spanish speaking users: this version do not has Spanish subtitles.

My especific problems for the GMAT test lies on the reading, vocabulary and structure of it, on spot that english is not my first language.

To use the official guide is a must.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Alright, i'm a younger Meatloaf fan from a little before Bat Out of Hell II. When I first picked up Bat Out of Hell I, it made me really start to love old rock. That entire album is rock classic. Bat Out of Hell III shows his older voice off, and now more modern with songs being written by John 5 from Marilyn Manson and Nikki Sixx from Motley Crue, and even featuring Steve Vai on the guitar solo in Pigs. And Jim is such a great songwriter it's a great complete album. Meatloaf puts it down vocally on every track on this album. And Cry Over Me is phenom. If you are a Meatloaf fan, just get it. I promise it won't dissapoint. Great end to one of the greatest rock albums ever.

B00000C28M|4.0|I heard about this recording from a radio piece on NPR and immediately felt I had to have it.  It is a unique piece of history. There is the introduction Bernstein gave the audience explaining why he almost refused to conduct the concerto, and an equally enlightening interview with Gould himself.  Then there is Gould's unique interpretation.  Whether or not you prefer a more traditional interpretation is no matter, this one is still worth owning alongside your own.

I highly recommend this book for anyone who truly wants to create an action plan to improve their lives and exert the effort requried to get there.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Buy this -- and, if you like it, maybe also check out the New Zealand band The Chills, perhaps via their greatest-hits compilation.  \\"The Sound of Settling\\" from Death Cab's previous album and \\"Crooked Teeth\\" (the second-best song on this one after the opener) are reminiscent enough of The Chills that I'm not entirely convinced that Ben Gibbard and Martin Phillipps are not the same person.  I mean, seriously, it's spooky.
0316172324|5.0|Blink is a fast read.  The case studies show how the human brain is hardwired for certain actions and shaped by others.  Anyone who enjoys psychology or the nature versus nurture discussions will get a lot from Blink.  The synopsis of a police officer's thought process when shooting at a person or being shot at was revealing and riveting.

1401302378|4.0|The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More by Chris Anderson is a book that explores how people shop and purchase and compares it to how they did this over the last 40 years to come up with a new theory of niches and individual tastes. Chris shows how the age of mega blockbuster is coming to a close. As part of that statement he shows that the numbers as a whole are going up as general consumption is going up, but as a percentage of the population and of the purchases dollars spent, it is steadily decreasing. Mr. Anderson utilizes Rhapsody, iTunes, and Amazon.com are leading the way in offering huge selections to feed our very individualistic tastes. We no longer have to be satisfied by the stock of the local record store, or by what the small B. Dalton located in the mall to drive what we could buy. If I have a taste for Industrial Alternative Carnival music, then now I can truly buy music that fits that genre.<br /><br />The problem that Chris points at though is how can consumers find these items. How can I find the Surf Green KitchenAid StandMixer? (Did you know there are 24 colors of KitchenAid StandMixers?) How do I find new music to fit my taste or a new author or work that fits my need to read? It was possible for the old time record store clerk to handle their catalog, but can any one person handle 300,000+ albums in their head and Amazon carries many, many more than that...<br /><br />I enjoyed the book as a sort of mental exercise where I utilized his problem space (even though I sit in it at work) and tried to think of ways to surface those things that are not commonly shown since they aren't mainstream. The problem is really surfacing those to the right people. I recommend this book as a look at marketing to niches and the smaller, avid consumers within.
B000F3AAUW|2.0|Might just be me--but this is one of those CD's that the song they play on the radio is the only decent one. Maybe I'm too old for the rest--but wish I had kept the crystal so I could sell it on Ebay.
0743289412|5.0|I've read every book Stephen King has written: I've liked them all, but I absolutely loved this book. I enjoyed every word, especially as one reviewer already put it, \\"the language of marriage\\". It made me think about my marriage and how precious it is to me. I appreciated the power that SK gives the bond between two people who love each other so completely.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This movie offers a nice philospohical view on some trends in human evolution and thought.  A nice cross section of various philosophies is investigated and discussed through animated characters.  The movie is heady and raises a lot of questions.  If you are of the intellectual bent and like to watch films more than once, this one is for you.  It could also serve as an atypical date movie - one that leads into conversation. <br /> <br />Check out also- I heart huckabees and what the bleep do we know.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I don't have a lot to say other than if you don't buy this album, you are missing out on some of the greatest music this man has put out.  I've been a Johnny Cash fan for over 30 years, and I feel that this album is a very fitting, yet sad, end to a phenomenal and brilliant career.  His version of Gordon Lightfoot's song \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" causes goosebumps and \\"Rose of My Heart\\" is as touching a song as you can find.  With that said, every song within this album is worthwhile.  If you are a Johnny Cash fan, you must have this album.  It is, by far, some of the greatest work the man has done, and I mean that with all my heart.  I still miss him so much.
B000005HFH|5.0|Technical standpoint? Is that how you listen to music? Sorry. I have no idea as to \\"technical standpoint\\". The music makes me feel alive and it makes me feel good, as a bohemian should. Chet baker has over 60 albums and has remained popular for over 50 years. I doubt if anything \\"heard in local clubs\\" will ever leave a legacy close to Mr. Baker's. An acquired taste? I was hooked in the first thirty seconds of the first Chet Baker song I ever heard and I've yet to hear anything he has done to change my mind. Most folks I know that like Chet Baker feel the same. Stop thinking and listen, this music is life at its best.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I like every song.  Unlike many other bands, this CD is just as good as their previous CD.
0451167716|5.0|Like many people, I was introduced (years ago) to the Corleone Family through the movies The Godfather and The Godfather Part II. Those films remain on my short list of all time greats, real hard-hitters.    After all this time, I decided to finally give the book a try. I was surprised not only by the richness and flair in the writing -- Puzo had real skill -- but also by the differences between the film(s) and the book. Many of these differences are subtle, others less so.    While the movie(s) and the book walk hand-in-hand in many areas -- such as Michael's time in Sicily, young Vito's formative years in New York (as illustrated in the film Part II), and the grisly scene at Louis' restaurant -- there are some very interesting differences. Among these are: the character and motivations of the key players (in the book, Michael takes his broken jaw as nothing *but* personal); the extensive focus on Johnny Fontane, who is actually a rather likeable, sympathetic character amid the parade of anti-heroes; and, to a lesser extent, the fleshing out of Luca Brasi's tendencies, capabilities, and background. Far from the verbally stumbling, imposing-yet-almost-loveable oaf he is portrayed as in the movie, the book version of Luca is a brutal monster who is more demon than human.    This book is one of those reads that has you ripping through it from cover to cover. Though it is lengthy, you will hunger for still more of the Corleone Family's dark tale.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|BRICK is a noir story the likes of The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon - except set in a modern day Californian high school. If this premise seems ludicrous to you, I can't imagine you'd appreciate this film. However, I thought the change up worked really well. Having your reluctant hero be a jaded, withdrawn teen who eats his lunch behind the school and yearns to solve the mystery of what happened to his ex-lady love completely enthralled me. The twists on the old form are interesting. The vamp being a drama student with a surprisingly posh dressing room. The go-to sidekick being a nerd with access to his mom's cell phone. The muscle being a growling hip hop inspired pot smoker. The movie seethes with a smart energy and the dialogue sizzles.  <br /> <br />And even after you watch the first time, and the mystery is solved, Brandon's journey is so intense and swirling that it's great to watch over and over again.  <br /> <br />The soundtrack and cinematography complete the package to make a slick movie that is both fun and dark.  <br /> <br />My favorite scene is the one that (for me) best encapsulates the film's tone: Brandon gets pulled into the vice principal's office, where he is asked to rat out potential dealers on school property. Brandon says he is no man's stoolie. He did it once, but that was \\"to see [the dealer] eaten not to see you [the VP] fed!\\" He then shouts that if the VP has a discipline issue with him \\"write me up or suspend me!\\" This scene so clearly mirrors those scenes where the noir hero is asked to compromise his own investigation that I was tittering throughout.  <br /> <br />This film is an original and interesting tale with beautiful camera work and excellent performances. Highly recommended.  <br /> <br />One note of warning: Sadly, the packaging of this movie gives away some of the twists and turns in the movie. SO I would recommend not looking too hard at the cover before checking it out.
B000301YY8|4.0|James Blunt has a very unique voice.  I saw him on Oprah and he is very personable, too. Great lyrics with the exception of his need to drop the F bomb in the title song.

B00005YU1O|5.0|This movie is brilliant. The use of this kind of animation along with the endless accounts and philosophies driven into your head is nothing short of amazing, totally original, and mind-blowing. And, yes, this movie is even better than A Scanner Darkly. Its an experience all its own. <br />

B00005JKEZ|4.0|A terrific movie bringing to life a legendry hero that has been revitalised using modern technology (colour at last!)to bring it into the 21st Century, but without the \\"gatchetry\\" that so many films use these days to ensure their success. <br /> <br />This movie allows \\"todays generation\\" to no only experience a movie that the \\"baby boomers\\" enjoyed but also brings back to life an era of folk legend that may well have otherwise been all but forgotten.  <br /> <br />A classic movie not to be missed and highly recommended to all.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I really abhor dealing in absolutes, but here I will make an exception. With all due respect to Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61, Blonde on Blonde and the first two works of this troika, Modern Times is Dylan's master work.  Reprising such blues stalwarts as \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" and  Slim Harpo's \\"Hip Shake\\" (\\"Someday Baby\\" on this disk), mixing in time-worn themes of lost love and the fragility of life on the road into impeccably-crafted ballads and clever ditties, Dylan has never been better. Although the quality of his voice seems to be ever-deteriorating, he more than compensates by uncanny timing reminiscent of the best of the blues delay-singers. The gold standard-this is the one to own if you can only have one.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I love to go to rock concerts, all my life. I travelled from Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1994 to Tampa, FL, specially for this concert. And I can say that it is one of my top 5 favorite. Many years ago the video was released, but since the DVD era I couldn't wait to have it. However its a analogic copy, the quality of sound and imagen its very good. Happy to enjoy again this wonderful concert. Don't miss it. <br />
0307346609|5.0|I'm the sort that enjoys non-fiction. Pouring over history books in my spare time is my gig, and it's rare to find me interested in a fictional book, and even more rare for it to have such a seemingly outlandish plot. I hate horror films. <br /> <br />Even so, this book kept me rivited. I couldn't put it down!
B000059TEQ|5.0|I'm amazed by how many people have written reviews bashing the line which sums up this entire film's essence & message: \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\\"  I think people are misunderstanding & misinterpreting this phrase in a way which makes it seem both simplistic (it's not) and implausibly meaningless (again, it's not).  The precise aspect of this film which 'gets' under your skin (if you enjoyed it & understood its subtletly) is summed up in this one line.  If you read the line (or hear it) as meaning that love means never SAYING you're sorry OR never DOING so in a relationship - then it will seem saccharine & of course, untrue.  But if you dig a little deeper you'll see that the word 'having' changes the entire tone of the line -and people are misinterpreting it woefully.  When you love someone as these two characters love each other (and it is a rare love - which is perhaps why so many people are skeptical of its very existence) and understand each other on the level of the spirit and soul - then it is a tacit & implicit understanding at the core level of the relationship that you love the other person unconditionally - faults and all & they love you in precisely the same way. Therefore - to say you're sorry for any number of possible slights, hurts, offenses or bruises which WILL come along in the course of ANY close relationship - is neither necessary or productive WHEN it stems from guilt over something which the other party has ALREADY FORGIVEN YOU FOR because they see straight through to the core of your humanity, know that you're imperfectly flawed & love you just the same.  This line doesn't mean literally 'never say you're sorry to your spouse or significant other'  - it simply means that love on this level has an understanding that goes beyond words & which words cannot elevate any higher - which makes using them superflous at times such as the moment which this line is from. Jenny knows Oliver didn't mean what he said, she already KNOWS he regrets having said it and the fact that the guilt & pain on his face move her to say such a beautiful thing out of truly altruistic/unconditional love is the point of this ENTIRE movie.  Guilt is harmful for both parties in any relationship and never more so than when it is induced or required or elicited by one person seeking an apology from the other - nothing damages a relationship quicker than the demand of apologies for behaviors which are not only human but inevitable. Jenny is simply freeing Oliver up to be who he is, however he is, at any moment - because when he's with her it is understood that he will be accepted regardless of his actions due to the fact that she sees the person & NOT the behavior.  If more people loved in this way today the world would be a much better place. Of course you're GOING to say you're sorry many, many times in a relationship. But if it's a strong, healthy & mature relationship - your apology truly isn't necessary because the other party isn't holding a grudge or expecting it - it is simply a courteous reminder that you admit you behaved badly AND that you respect your mate's feelings- nothing more (if it becomes more & is used like a bargaining chip in a relationship you may as well give up because the other party loves themselves more than you - and that is NOT true, unconditional love.). <br />This is one of my all-time favorite films for the simple fact that it doesn't spend too much time TRYING to impress the viewer - it is understated where it needs to be, emotive when it's appropriate and a superb example that sometimes less is more in a classic film. If more films stuck to telling a compelling story in a straightforward way today this movie would not stand out - the fact that it does (36 years after its initial release) should tell us something about what the heart & soul truly require of art: to be moved by a situation or moment or life which you can put yourself in the middle of and in doing so you are awakened to the very essence of your own humanity & forever changed.

B000002BSG|5.0|I am a real jazz lover, old school, new school, acid jazz, neo-soul, funk, you name it. This particular Jamiroquai cd is everthing. In my opinion, it rocks. There's not one song on the whole disk that I don't totally enjoy. I only recently heard of the group, and this cd is the only one I have heard so far. I would like to know if there's any other Jamiroquai cd's I should check out? I need to know if there's maybe another work as good as, if not better, than this one. I am one of those people who hate to buy a cd and only like one or two songs on the whole thing. If you know of any other Jamiroquai cd's, or any other artist who sounds as awesome as this one does, please let me in on it.
0618001905|5.0|How can a government commit atrocities in other countries without its own citizens finding out?  This book presents just such a case.  It details the grasp for colonial possessions made by King Leopold of Belgium in the late 1800's.  Through promises to promote free trade and the betterment of life for Africans, Leopold managed to grab a huge piece of Africa for himself.  In other words, this colony was the property of Leopold, not Belgium.  Once he got control of this colony, the wellfare of Africans was the furthest thought from his mind.  What he wanted was money, and lots of it.  He went back on his promises to promote free trade on the Congo, and set up an ivory monopoly.  Through this monopoly, vicious atrocities were inflicted upon the Africans living in the Congo.  Things only got worse when the rubber boom started.  Some of the things done to turn a buck will turn your stomach. <br /> <br />I really recommend that people who are interested in international politics and business read this book.  It might make you think a little differently about some of the things happening in the world today.

B00005JLR2|5.0|awesome to watch with all age groups - funny with enough to keep parents laughing and enjoying as well as small children to teenagers.
B00009XITP|5.0|If you want something sweet and fun I highly reccommend this movie.  Great timeless story line and a little spunk.
B000B6OD1U|5.0|I saw a video clip of \\"The Kill\\" on TV and had to know more about this band and their music. After hearing the title song \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", I liken Jared Leto's voice to the male equivalent of a siren inviting unsuspecting mariners to dash themselves on the rocks.  The versatility of his vocal range and musical expression is a skill I rarely find in most metal artists. 30 seconds music is edgy, haunting, melodic and passionate- and that's just in track 1.  If you're into ear-pounding guitar riffs, tribal drums and screaming, you'd probably want to steer clear of this album. But if you like electronically- influenced music (even New Age music) and don't mind Metal, you'd appreciate this CD.  I look forward to hearing more from 30 seconds; and hopefully they won't change their sound  in their next project (unlike some bands who think success gives them carte blanche to do whatever and think their fans will still buy into it...&lt;cough> Evanescence)
B000FUF6QS|5.0|<br />   Excellent!  Chilling! The last few moments of the movie were frightening and sad.  It showed  how cruel man can be to other men.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The 4-Disc Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven starring Orlando Bloom, Eva Green and other famous actors impells me to rate this as an extremely excellent movie.  The additional scenes in the two discs of the movie made the story line more enjoyable.  The two additional discs provided a historical setting, the views of the director, actors, cinematographers, set and costume designers, and others regarding both the process of making the movie, and the significance of the topic of the movie made viewing it again a much richer and more profound experience.   After viewing all four of the discs, I would have to rate the movie as superior both aesthetically and dramatically.  I would highly recommend viewing and purchasing the 4-Disc Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven.
0140187650|5.0|The most important factor in my decision to give this book five stars is courageousness with which Arendt was willing to expound controversial ideas, especially since her subject matter was intimately related to such a sensitive topic, the Holocaust.  A few of those ideas come to mind:    1. The principal concept formulated in this book is that atrocities such as the Holocaust are not the result of evil masterminds.  Even though Arendt leaves room for evil masterminds as secondary factors, to her the most important factor contributing to such crimes against humanity is the \\"banality\\" (best understood as \\"commonplaceness\\", not \\"boring\\", as another reviewer suggests) of evil.  We are all evil, in the end.  The biggest moral lesson from the book is derived from this concept; that moral lesson is that we are all frighteningly too capable of the kind of evil the Nazis were guilty of.  If we spend all day captivated by the evil of Hitler we will have no time left to reflect on our own immorality.    2. Another concept that Arendt develops is that the Jews were surprisingly passive in response to their situation.  Now, obviously there are room for exceptions, and perhaps fairly large exceptions, but nevertheless this turned out to be a very controversial idea.  I do, however, feel that Arendt successfully defends this position to the point that perhaps a second subtitle to this book might have been: \\"the banality of cowardice\\".  This problem, too, must be seen in the proper light, for it show us that when faced with an evil attacker too many of us are willing to shy away from the fight.    Aside from the philosophical point, this book is about a remarkable trial.  Adolf Eichmann was a former Nazi official, kidnapped out of Argentina by Israeli Mossad agents, and tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the Israeli government.  I especially admire Arendt's position on this point because she isn't afraid to criticize the Israeli government for its conduct during the trial (Arendt is Jewish, in case you didn't know).  Specifically, Arendt shows that the government attempted to make the world feel guilty about the Holocaust  by painting Eichmann as the mastermind of the evil scheme.    This book is well written and helps the reader understand the complexities surrounding the Holocaust and the trial of Eichmann, issues that most people tend to see a simply black and white.  I think this book should be required reading in high school because it is a model of good writing and effective academic inquiry.

0143036556|5.0|Collapse is a great follow-up of Diamond's Guns,Germs and Steel.  Like Guns, Germs and Steel,  this book covers an incredible span of time and offers sound writing and reasoning by a darn good story teller.

These two books offer the reader an opportunity to learn an incredible amount about the history of mankind and at the same time enjoy a good book.

B000I5X81K|4.0|We all have different tastes and preferences, and almost all of these posts reflect people who love Josh Groban's music and talent, and I am heartily inlcuded in that category! That just goes to show how good Josh really is!  However, like B. Walker's comment (from Wisconsin) and \\"Debbie\\", I feel that this is good, but not his best (please dont' berate me or call me a loser for being in the minority). Sometimes it takes a dozen listenings before some of the songs begin to grow on my affections. So, I will wait for that to happen! Right now, though, it seems to me that he has shifted to more pop sound than the \\"classical\\" or \\"classical crossover\\" genre through which he broke into musical fame. \\"Closer\\" sold 14 million copies (!!!) for a good reason. I think it's his best (at the moment). On \\"Awake\\" he seems to show slightly more vocal versatility, but I just love the more singable melodies of Closer (there is not 1 weak song at the album!).  I thought that David Foster's work on the earlier albums was EXCELLENT. He really loves Josh and was very involved in those productions. His lesser role in \\"Awake\\" may have something to do with the different sound, but I still like the album very much. One commentor said that she wishes for a Christmas album, and I also e-mailed Josh about that a few months ago; I think it would be amazing. The sky is the limit for Josh Groban. What a voice.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Its just so unfair. John Mayer is so talented. Why can't he share with some of us wantabe rockers. I'm 58, have played in numerous local rock groups, still play, own a couple Strats and a Fender Twin Reverb, so I know what I like. And I like Mayer. This is his best effort yet. This kid can sing and is an extremely talented guitarist. If you like George Harrison's guitar style, Mayer gives you a good dose in Continuum. Except for two or three cuts, every other song prompted me to sit down and learn it the first week I had the CD. I am sure you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />Randy in Tucson

B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashomon (1950; directed by Akira Kurosawa and starring Toshiro Mifune) is one of those films that the truly hip have seen, and not many others; rather like certain books--On the Road, The Satanic Verses, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Naked Lunch--it has a certain hip cache, being one that cineastes have all seen and can discuss in great detail.  Name-droppers know they need only mention the name in a knowledgeable context to be viewed with awe.<br /><br />In truth, however, Rashomon is the sort of film that everyone should see; it's a true classic, in a league with Casablanca, Citizen Kane and others.  The film examines truth, in the context of a rape and murder in 12th Century Japan, from four different perspectives; a woodcutter who witnessed the whole incident yet was afraid to report it, the bandit who committed the crime, the murdered man's ghost (through a medium) and the rape victim (the murdered man's wife).  There are a few elements which remain constant from each version of the story--that the murdered man was tied up and forced to watch the bandit ravish his wife, and that he did indeed die--but how he died varies.  It was either a swordfight with the bandit, at his wife's hand with a dagger, or suicide resulting from his being absolutely crushed by his wife choosing to leave with the bandit.  Did she demand his death?  Did he look at her with scorn after the crime?  Was she really raped or did she yield consensually to the bandit?  Honesty is also explored in detail, with the wife's honesty being most in question, but also with the three men sheltering from a rainstorm at the ruined gate of Rashomon who relate the story between themselves.<br /><br />This was one of the late Toshiro Mifune's (1920-1997) first collaborations with Akira Kurosawa, and his criminally-insane Tajomaru is masterfully acted.  So effective is Mifune's acting that you truly loathe Tajomaru; you're torn between pity and disgust for the wife (Masahiko Kyo, also a brilliant actress), and there are truly few really sympathetic characters among the cast here.  The camera work is exemplary, shows what Kurosawa was best known for--unusual perspectives in some truly arresting shots, proving that his eye for detail was as sharp in black and white as it would later be in colour (cf. Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, and Ran, 3 latter-day Kurosawa masterpieces).  Absolutely worth seeing, and proof of the saying that there are three sides to every story (to wit:  mine, yours, and what really happened)--but also proving that what really happened isn't even ever certain.ress), and there are truly few really sympathetic characters among the cast here.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|I was very reluctant to buy the \\"limited edition\\" versions because of the negative reviews. While I wanted the original non-doctored-and-rewritten-within-an-inch-of-their-lives versions, I was worried about the supposed inferior quality everyone was complaining about. Well, maybe my TV and sound system is just too primitive, but I certainly didn't notice poor quality. In fact I thought the quality was amazing! That flat cartoony look of hi-def Lucas loves so much was blessedly absent. And Star Wars looked like Star Wars - not a CG parody of itself! It was like watching the trilogy for the first time all over again.  <br /> <br />To anyone in the market for the original edition, feeling nervous after reading these reviews - take the gamble and judge for yourself. I for one now consider my Star Wars collection finally complete.
6305511055|5.0|When I watch this movie it's as if the writer in 1975 had a pre-cognizance of what was going to happen in 2003. Pay particular attention to the last scene between Redford and Robertson. The words Robertson says are more relevant today that they were then. <br />Besides meaning and relevance it's also a great action thriller, with a little romance. Faye Dunaway is at her most beautiful and Redford his most attractive. They both give truly amazing performances as ordinary people accidently caught up in monumental intrigues they know nothing of. <br />
0786890754|4.0|PS, I Love You is Chick-Lit, but that's a GOOD thing.  I like the premise that a husband would love his wife enough to plan her year to gradually bring her out of her mourning.  Wouln't it be a wonderful world if there were such a man out there?  I don't care how old Cecilia Ahern is, she told a good story.  I agree that some of the characters are flawed, they are self-centered (including Holly), but aren't we all?  If she had made them all perfect, wouldn't it have been too sickly sweet?  I liked this book enough to buy another Ahern book (\\"Love, Rosie). AND I WAIT IMPATIENTLY FOR THE MOVIE!!!

B0000DZ3EN|4.0|What a great movie from my childhood!  Darker than the cookie-cutter original Oz, but still having that something that makes it a good ridiculous kid movie.  It is very dark, not for those faint of heart children though.  I'm just so excited they made this a DVD.  The quality of the video doesn't look like it was from the 1980s and while there are a few hokie blue-screen arms flailing silly shots, overall it's pretty timeless.  It's a very interesting look into what would actually happen if Dorothy came home [1st movie] and told everyone about \\"Oz\\" especially in Kansas in the 50s.  Not only interesting, quite realistic.  You'll just have to see it to understand!

B0000024K1|5.0|Possibly the greatest rap album of all time.  The hard rhymer Chuck D. paired with the multi-layered production of Hank Shocklee(Bomb Squad) still packs as potent a punch as when it first dropped.  Not to sleep on Flava, the greatest hype man in the business is essential to the final product; I can't imagine this album being as perfect as it is without him.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I completely agree with most of you-you have to listen to it couple of times to really appreciate it.  My personal favorite-Dreaming Of Andromeda and Message From IO....Enigma definitely turned more \\"futuristic\\" but that is to be expected-it's not 1991 anymore!!   I was dissapointed since some people suggested that its time for Michael Cretu \\" to close his shop\\".....the truth is that times change, people change and music needs to make the same progress. Nothing is like back in 1991, so why should Enigma..?

B000000I02|4.0|Musically, this album is 4-star impressive.  Just don't look for any substance lyrically.  The song titles and lyrics are feeble attempts at quirky humor that gets old fast.  It is unfortunate because had they at least made some of the efforts more serious in the lyrical department, I would consider this a classic and must have for fans of the Canterbury scene of the 70's.  It is certainly a keeper but if you can't get past the nonsensical lyrics, better steer clear.  For that reason alone, it will not be a frequent spinner in my CD player although the music is always very satisfying. <br /> <br />If you have all the Camel and Caravan albums, round out your collection with both Hatfield efforts.  You should enjoy them. <br /> <br />- Scriptor <br /> <br /> <br />

B0007OCG4W|4.0|The movie has some superb poignant moments.  The opening scene is one of my all time favorites.  It captures the initial spark and recognition of the essence we see in another.  The dark and tortured paths are real enough to be painful but compacted enough to be bearable.  I recommend it to anyone looking for some real emotions even if the story line isn't your normal cup of tea.  Good performances by all.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|Mayer is a prodigal young guitarist whose playing style has been compared to the young Clapton or Hendrix (he covers \\"Bold as Love\\" on this album). But his lightweight, self-penned pop-rock ditties make for pretty good FM radio listening as well. His vocal range is a bit limited, but so are many others' (Robert Cray comes to mind). \\"In Repair\\" is my favorite song here, but there are several hit singles on here waiting to happen and the pre-released \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\" has happened. Not to everyone's taste, but pretty good. Say 3.5 stars, a half better than \\"Heavier Things.\\"
B000066C1N|4.0|The soaring quality of Zimmer's music and the beat of Bryan Adams combine for a soundtrack album that my 4 year-old daughter listens to every day. I like it, too. Although not 4 or 5 times a day. But then, I left 4 a while ago. The music represents the storyline very well. It's dynamic, heroic, and heartwarming. If those are bad qualities to you, skip this album, otherwise....crank it up!
B0002JP4L4|5.0|I hadnt seen this film for years and brought this on a whim but its great. Yes the film looks a little dated but its a great story with a brilliant soundtrack so what more can you ask for? <br />The extra stuff on this DVD is really interesting and I appriciate the story even more after watching it with Kevin Bacons commentry.

Totally random safe dates with yourself. I keep this book close at hand for the moments when I think I need a little stimulation. Highly recommended.
B000GRUMPU|4.0|After growing up with the original by Irwin Allen, and then seeing Titanic, I was pleasantly surprised. The action sequences are great, and there is enough storyline to keep you interested. At least no characters were repeated and although you keep hoping that everyone survives, it would not be a disaster movie without death to the lesser characters. You don't even realized the CG. I do recommend watching the how it was filmed section-Irwin Allen would be proud of the live water and fire used on the film sets.
B000F7CMQ8|4.0|Frankly, I have not watched this DVD version yet as I have it on Laser Disc.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Purchased this based on the bands association with Steve Wilson of the band Porcupine Tree. I heard the instrumental passages and the mellow vocals of Mikael in some of the longer Opeth songs. It was the death metal \\"singing\\" style that turned me off. BUT all of the other stuff was great. This Damnation album is a tad too mellow for their core fans but it's a great standalone listen for anyone who loves good music. I wish the band would abandon the cookie monster vocals and just go straight forward singing - his voice is so great to begin with. Anyway - LOVE THIS ALBUM ! BUT IT !!

0375831002|5.0|The book thief of the title is a young girl named Liesel Meminger.  As the novel opens, at the beginning of World War II, Liesel is on her way to her new foster parents, Rosa and Hans Hubermann.  Her younger brother has just died on the train, and her mother will soon disappear.  Her career as a book thief begins with a gravedigger's handbook, which Liesel casually picks up after her brother is buried.  This stolen book serves as a lifeline for Liesel between her past life and her new one with the Hubermanns, where she arrives scared, lonely, and illiterate.  \\"Papa\\" Hans becomes Liesel's knight as he rescues her from loneliness, calms her nighttime terrors, and teaches her to read. Rosa, though no less caring toward Liesel, runs the house with the toughness of a drill sergeant and the mouth of a sailor; she addresses everyone, husband and foster daughter alike, as \\"filthy pig.\\"  The wider community of Molching, a suburb of Munich, features a well-developed cast of characters, among them Liesel's best friend Rudy, who dreams of becoming the next Jesse Owens, and the mayor's wife, who gives Liesel access to her well-stocked library. <br />Life is difficult enough for Liesel and the Hubermanns, good Germans who quietly disapprove of the Nazi regime and are so poor that they barter in cigarettes and barely have enough to eat; things only get harder when they hide Max, a young Jewish man, in their basement.  Zusak skillfully weaves together the story of Max, his connection to the accordion-playing Hans, and his meager existence in the Hubermann basement with the tale of Liesel, her passion for books and reading, and how she uses this fervor to connect with others and survive in the world around her. <br />Readers should not be fooled into thinking that this is an easy book just because it is being marketed for young adults.  It is demanding and emotionally-wrenching, and will leave readers pondering its mysteries for days after turning the last page.  Though the heft issimilar to the latest Harry Potter, and the style can at times be compared to Jonathan Safran Foer, there is nothing else in literature quite like The Book Thief.  Recommended for ages 17 to adult. <br />Wendy Wasman, AJL Newsletter <br /> <br />
038073186X|1.0|I bought this book on a friend's recommendation.  If I had been in a book store and could have read a page or two I would have known immediately it was not the type of book I would read.  I'm sure it's wonderful for those who like it.  I passed it on to a friend.
B000065V42|5.0|Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is one of the best comedy films of all time.  It was very interesting when it came out because, as a child, I was amazed to think that if you were the size of an ant, it would be a LONG journey from the back of the yard ALL the way to the house.  Just the fact that you'd have plenty of obstacles to avoid would make it all the more challenging and adventurous.   <br /> <br />That's exactly what happens in the film- the tiny kids have to walk through tall grass and other objects just to make it back to the house.  It's awesome.  This was also a pretty groundbreaking film when it came out because of all the hard work that went into making the story believable.  I love this movie.
0340838035|5.0|This was one of those books that are hard to lay down. Picoult is one of my favorite authors and I don't think she knows how to write a bad story. <br /> <br />The Harte's (Nick's parents), and the Gold's, (Emily's parents), were neighbors and the very best of friends. Their children were practically born together just a few months apart from each other. And Nick and Emily were inseparable growing up. They were true soulmates. But things changed when Emily becomes pregnant with Chris's child, and she becomes depressed wanting to commit suicide. She is afraid to tell her parents for fear she won't be the perfect daughter that they expect of her. And she never does tell Chris, but instead wants him to help her plan her death. Of course this completely breaks Chris up, but rather then see Emily so miserable, he goes along with her-taking his father's gun out of the cabinet at home-loading it with 2 bullets. One for her, and then one for him. They go off to a secluded place where they've always gone, and Chris carries the gun, but still tries to fight Emily out of it. She grabs the gun out of his hand, and with her finger on the trigger, the gun goes off. Emily dies later at the hospital, and Chris though he gets hurt, lives. <br /> <br />This event happens on a Friday night, when both families usually eat out, which they were doing when this happened. But they had no idea until later when they each returned home and got a phone call in the middle of the night of the terrible tragedy had taken place. <br /> <br />The story from there is that Chris of course gets the blame. Later he is arrested and put in jail until the trial. He is out of his mind the whole time, trying to remember exactly what happened. Whether he gets off or not remains to be seen until later in the book. His attorney, Jordan, goes to fight for him. <br /> <br />The families naturally split. Melanie and Augusta Chris's mom are no longer friends but bitter enemies. Melanie won't accept her daughter's death, and acts just as though she is still alive. Her hatred for Chris as well as his mother now is very real. But interestingly enough, Melanie's husband Michael, and Augusta begin having an affair. But that is short-lived as the two families move away and separate from each other later in this book.
0800141660|4.0|If you enjoy reading Jane Austen novels or watching films like Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Mansfield Park, and more, Sense and Sensibility is for you.  Adapted by Emma Thompson and directed by Ang Lee (later to direct the acclaimed Brokeback Mountain) the film is beautiful, touching, and more true to the book than most films based on novels.

B00005JO9J|4.0|Well in this case, when purchased in some sort of deal, they do.  For anyone left in the Western world who hasn't been bombarded by some fan of Grey's and forced to watch it, you don't know what you're missing :)  A very fun drama, as long as you can accept that it is rooted in relationship melodrama more than medical accuracy.  If you're going to buy season one, you really may as well purchase Season 2 as well, because you wont want to stop.

The cd accompaniment tracks are great and I use them as the \\"test\\"....the students must play along with the track successfully before moving on.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I must say, this film took my breath away, I love this musical so much,the whole cast did such a great job that I watch the movie over and over and still I find myself crying at the end, which, I think, is the best part of the movie. I can't help but feel compassion for the phantom, Gerard Butler played him so well, with such passion and fire that I found myself wishing that Christine would have went off with him but the way that Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson, fought for Christine, cried for her, wanted to lay his life down for her, had my emotions tied up in knots, wanting both men to win the girl. <br /> Emmy Rossum, who played Christine, sang with such beauty and strength, I laughed with her, felt fear for her, and cried with her.  <br />I felt the characters so strongly, the way the actors just took the music and ran away with their emotions, it left me breathless, wanting more, especially at the end when the three main characters, I think, played their parts the strongest. <br /> I just loved this movie, but when I watched it for the first time I went in thinking I was going to hear voices like I've heard years before, playing the parts I've been so used to for so long. But as the movie played on I realized that these incredible actors have taken these parts of this beautiful Gothic love story and have made it their own. Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber did an awesome job bringing one of my favorite musicals to the movies, thank you.  <br />
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Any Dylan fans out there should definitely have this fabulous CD. It's terrific. A must for the collector.
0385474547|5.0|I so enjoyed this book. It gave me great insight into African culture. It shows how people's belief systems are such, that if a culture is completely unlike our own, we feel that we must change it. This book creates a dramatic example of causing more harm than good when missionaries work to change a civilization. If my son had not been required to read this book in high school, I never would have found it, and what a loss that would have been.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Easily on of the best NIN albums ever... \\"Last\\" Might just be Reznor's best song
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Dylan picks up where he left off last time out with Love and Theft (also a 5 star item, in my opinion).  This one, too, is a gem. Imagine a delectable mix of jitterbug; tight,quick tempo blues; both slow and up tempo waltz (tip of the Stetson to Willie Nelson); and, in \\"Beyond the Horizon,\\" a lovely tune that could easily grace a soundtrack for The Great Gatsby.  Yes, have a glass of wine or two, put on this CD, and dance and laugh for awhile with a significant other.
B00005JO9J|1.0|Maybe it is just my dvd player, but I couldn't get these dvd's to play. Other dvd's play on my player and these dvd's play on other dvd players. They wont work for mine though, so I have to rate my satisfaction with this product at a very low one star.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Judy Garland is one of my favorite standard singers. Her movies are wonderful and this is one of the best ones!
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I really enjoyed this DVD, even the \\"newer\\" Floyd material that I'm not a huge fan of.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the original source isn't the greatest, but the transfer seems to be as high quality as possible, and the audio is great.
0790749858|5.0|My son requested this on his video list and he enjoys this one tremendously.
B000069AUI|4.0|I think that this is one of Coldplay's better albums along with their Parachutes album which I believe is their best album to date.
0316172324|5.0|I read Gladwell's 'Tipping Point' this summer and was just as impressed with Blink. Great insight.
B00005U122|5.0|Hands down this is the best concert DVD ever made. The video quality and the sound quality are just superb. The band is absolutely loaded with talent. From Brmahall III on guitar, to Graham Broad on the drums, and of course the keeper of the Floyd sound John Carin is amazing. Roger choses a fantastic song selection, much better then seen on Pulse. His voice has aged, no doubt, but he still delivers a solid and inspired performance.     All other directors should take note of this DVD. The camera does not jump every two seconds. You get to really take in everything that you are seeing. You really feel like you are in the front of the audience viewing this show live. I recently saw Waters on his current Dark Side of the Moon Tour and this really does capture what the live experience is like.If you are a fan of Floyd you need to get this DVD. It is the type of disc you will play again and again, it just never gets old. Pop it in, crank it up, relax and enjoy. They broke the mold on artists like this, truely one of a kind.
B000062X90|5.0|The album \\"Argus\\" by Wishbone Ash is by far their best studio album they ever produced. Every song, except maybe \\"Leaf and Stream\\" is a beautifully crafted 'artsy\\" rock style. Somewhat similar to Pink Floyd or Steely Dan, only with much more guitars. With the addition of their awesome song \\"Phoenix\\" added to this remastered & revisited cd, this is defintily a WishBone Ash essential cd.  Favorite picks are \\"Sometimes World\\" and \\"Blowing Free\\".  Can't go wrong with this CD
B000GPIPVU|4.0|I liked Trouble but I think this CD is a little better. I like the musical arrangements better  this time around. The addition of John Medeski and Chris Wood give the music a deeper more full sound. Trouble sounded mostly like Ray playing an acoustic guitar. Where Till the Sun Turns Black really has some excelent backing musicians. Lyrically I like both about the same. I say to get both discs they have alot to offer.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|I originally bought this movie to put on as a background during parties. I thought it would be nice to have music with an accent of visual entertainment. Many people end up enthralled; they sit down and watch the movie from begining to end. I have found that people that don't normally like techno enjoy this genre.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After seeing the movie Serenity, I learned that it was based on a TV series, Firefly.  My oldest son, he is 29, had heard that it was a very good but overlooked series, like Star Trek in the 60s.  I purchased this for him for his birthday and am glad that I did.  The series is a great mix of science fiction and western movies.  The acting, the writing, are the best I've seen on TV.  It is sad that this series was overlooked.  It has the feel of John Wayne in the old west mixed with Captain Kirk of Star Trek.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B000FIMG68|5.0|An intriguing story with an ending I'm sure but the story leaves us wanting more with each episode.  It has a lot of unanswered questions but as the story unfolds, I hope we get some of the answers!
B000H5U65C|5.0|This album is amazing. I would suggest this to any metal/drone/Mastodon fan hands down.
0316287059|5.0|Awesome book! Step by step instructions, with pictures, make this book so easy to use. Shows simple make up apps. and dramatic. Like changing Gweneth Paltrow to James Dean was incredible! And turning a man into a BEAUTIFUL, flawless woman was shocking! A must have for anyone who wants to learn some EASY make up tips, or stage make-up!!
0440236304|3.0|This book is a quick read and a good account by someone who was actually a paratrooper in the Normandy invasion. It is not nearly as comprehensive as the Band of Brothers and other books on Major Winters.  You may be disappointed if you have read them already.
1557507473|5.0|A very graphic yet human interpretation of the war. There are some fascinating looks into the darkest recesses of a man's psyche during the most grueling and sickening moments of warfare. Definitely worth the read for any WW2 or war buff in general, as well as any student of humanity.
0767802470|5.0|EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SHOPPING FOR, AND THIS DVD HAS EXTRA MATERIAL !! <br />WONDERFUL SOUND TRACK (I UNDERSTAND IT WAS RESTORED)AND IMAGE QUALITY EXCELLENT ON LARGE SCREEN TV. <br /> <br />THIS WAS A REPLACEMENT FOR A VHS, WHICH WOULDN'T LAST SO I'M ELATED TO HAVE THIS SPLENDID DVD.
B00000DHR0|3.0|Album in a nutshell:  Celine Dion presents an unusual Christmas collection that is not up to her usual standards.  All the original songs are great, the covers of Christmas songs are pretty good, but some of the songs don't belong.  I know Celine wants to include a French Christmas song on here, but \\"Les Cloches Du Hameau\\" is kind of annoying, as is her rendition of \\"Feliz Navidad.\\"  \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\" is too high church sounding and she tries too much to sound like a female Elvis on \\"Blue Christmas.\\"  And someone please tell me what the hell \\"Brahms Lullaby\\" is doing on this album!  But she redeems herself with exceptional originals, a nice cover of \\"The Christmas Song,\\" and a beautiful rendition of \\"O Holy Night.\\"  A pretty nice offering, but I expected better from Celine.    Best Song: \\"Another Year Has Gone By\\"     Christmas traditionals / Total tracks: 7/16    Sample This: The fun \\"Christmas Eve\\" and the seasonally uplifting \\"The Magic of Christmas Day\\"    What to Avoid: sad family renditions of \\"Feliz Navidad\\" and \\"Les Cloches Du Hameau\\" (she could have included her family on better songs) and    the sappy, out-of-place \\"Brahms' Lullaby\\"    The album in 2 words: mixed bag     Stocking Stuffer or under-the-tree: stocking stuffer
B000H0MKOC|4.0|Jason Reitman makes an impressive debut as director with this entertaining comedy `Thank You For Smoking,' which is more satirical than any of the comedies his father Ivan Reitman made. Despite the film's plot about one Nick Naylor, ace spokesperson for the tobacco industry, `Thank You For Smoking' refuses to take sides while keeping us hugely entertained with its dialogues. <br /> <br />Aaron Eckhart delivers a superb performance as Nick Naylor, a chief spokesman and lobbyist for tobacco industry, who in his `spin' mode can easily manipulate the opinions of the suspicious audiences on TV show. Nick is also a good father to his son Joey (Cameron Bright), before whom Nick tries to be a role model. Today Nick thinks of a brilliant idea of production placement - how about showing Hollywood stars smoking in a spaceship? - he flies to California with his son, meets a suave movie producer wearing kimono (Rob Lowe), and in his free time delivers a package to an ailing old man (Sam Elliott) who is about to sue the tobacco company. <br /> <br />The satire is funny, but its target changes frequently. It could be tobacco industry (why not), but also could be those politicians (represented by William H. Macy's senator) who seems very hostile to Nick, and Nick himself. Sometimes the story goes too far, which includes a brief episode of abduction, but it is most effective when it shows Nick's darkly funny conversations with his friends, lobbyists for alcohol and guns (Mari Bello and David Koechner, calling themselves MOD Squad) over their lunch. <br /> <br />Other cast includes Robert Duvall, Adam Brody, Kim Dickens, J. K. Simmons, and Katie Holmes. The acting is unanimously good, but the film belongs to Eckhart's Nick Naylor, or his art of spin. <br /> <br />The film may lack the thought-provoking ideas about the on-going social issues. Still what you see in `Thank You For Smoking' is always amusing, clever, and even absurdly funny, and is never boring.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|This release of Star Wars delivers exactly what is promised: the full, unedited 1977 release of the movie.  If this were any other movie made in 1977, no one would complain about the video or audio quality of the DVD.  It looks a devil of a lot better than my old VHS copies.  You will occasionally notice visual artifacts--little blemishes on the film--from the source material.  Artifacts are to be expected and they're very minor--no more than you would see sitting in a movie theater today.  The video is not anamorphic 16:9, which means that if you have a widescreen TV, you won't gain any fidelity over watching it letterboxed on a regular dimension TV of the same width. <br /> <br />If you don't presently own and would like to own the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD, and you won't be bothered if your Star Wars Trilogy DVDs aren't beastiful remasters of the original movie, then this is disc one of the set you should buy.
B00080JD6O|5.0|I was around when the original first came out (on vinyl - no duh) and it was startling then.  As a historical reminder it's still pretty good and has held up.  Beck is obviously the standout and his style has grown since that earlier time but Rod Stewart struts his R&B influences really well and does a great job ad-libbing the lyrics.  Bonus tracks, with the exception of unused takes of Truth material, are from earlier sessions and the sound is not as good, but help bridge the gap between Beck's Yardbird experience and the \\"super group\\" that appears on Truth.  The truth is they weren't a supergroup at that time - just a bunch of likely contenders.  The one caveat is Love Is Blue which JB himself complained was like wearing a pink toilet seat around his neck.  Come to think of it that's a pretty good visual for how that track sounds. Enjoy!
087349976X|5.0|Full of great illustrations and directions, Michler's book is a great design reference. I tackled one of the bracelets with some rather intricate wire work and was very pleased.
B000G03Q2S|5.0|The essence of Brian Wilson. The full bodied sound to the ear not unlike fine wine is to the pallet. This great package gives you your choice of production, both mono and stereo and caters to all the diehard Beach Boys fans with a variety of things, including a DVD to enjoy. A must have for those who never experienced Pet Sounds at its fullest. After all, this is one of the most important albums of all time!
B0009IW98O|5.0|Listen to the best ever
B0000E6XH3|3.0|I saw the video for One More Time on MTV a few years back and then one night saw the next two that started the story... and it intrigued me, but I couldn't find out how to find the rest. Then I found out about this movie. The middle bit is a little slow, but on the whole, very entertaining visually and musically. Any fan of anime or Daft Punk would enjoy it.
B000GRTQSE|4.0|This album is a masterpiece by a legend who, at 65 years old, topped the charts. Dylan is an extroadinary talent and seems to get even better with age. Every song is exceptional and showcases his great talent and songwriting ability.
069452607X|5.0|This is one of the best business books that I have read or heard (The author does an excellent job, narrating). As an investor, the book makes it a bit \\"easier\\" to identify a great company.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I have been a fan of Josh Groban since 1999 when he appeared on Rosie O'Donnell's show.  He has the best voice I have even heard.  This album is the best of all he has made.  His voice has gotten absolutely more mature and wonderful.  Waiting 3 yrs. for the album was worth the wait. The voice that reaches into your soul and brings tears to your eyes when he is singing in that wonderful powerful voice.  I still love the songs in Spanish and Italian. I am glad to see him venture into other territories such as African songs and the upbeat Machine.  I enjoyed watching the DVD with the making of the video, video shoot and photo shoots.  Josh has this wonderful sense of humor which we get to see in this extra DVD.  Cannot stop listening and watching it over and over.  Favorite song is February Song and the Romeo & Juliette song Un Giorno Per Noi.  I should really list all of the songs because they are all my new favorites.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I love Josh's first album, I like the second and now Awake, I love it. Thank you Josh. I feel like he's come back better than ever. The only song I don't like on the Awake album is Machine. Other than that I listen to all the tracks.
1582403589|5.0|I really like alternate historical fiction, like S.M. Stirling , and I think this crosses over into that. It's not just a scare you - gross you out kind of work. I ended up thinking more about the relationships and societal impacts than solely about a horde of undead. And that's what gives this series its power. <br /> <br />I like the artistic style, the character development and the plotline. I'd say, grab this and see if you want to run with the series - I bet you do.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Amazing second season.  You must see the first to understand anything that is going on.  The show just hooks you in and has you trying to figure out the \\"truth\\" of the island.  Very interesting to see how the second season focuses on the tail section of the plane.  I very much recommend this season if people have seen the first season and liked it.  The plot thickens nicely in this second season.
B000E97X66|5.0|This is as good a live rock album as you will ever find.  Sit back, dim the lights and you are in the audience for one of the hottest concerts of the 70's.
B000669GAI|5.0|What I love about this cd is that it has a song for just about every mood you could have. Vocals are astounding.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I've been a Dylan fan since the early 1960s.  I love this album, and I think it is his best effort in decades.
B00008PC2O|2.0|I specifically bought this special edition to play the WMV HD version through my PC.  Unfortunately the software is buggy, and caused major problems.  After hours of fiddling, downloading patches etc. I find out that you can ONLY play the software if you live in the US or Canada ( i live in Aus ) .  Very dissapointed.  If you are buying this for the HD content be careful, and search on the web for some more information before you buy it.
B00003CX95|5.0|I think everyone should see this film. It will be something people will be viewing a hundred years from now. By viewing it you see something heroic as well as finding something heroic in you.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Klaus Badelt score for the first Pirates movie is amazing. Layered with interesting trills of strings and percussion, the score can reflect the heroism of Jack Sparrow and cast as they creep, sail and fight!<br /><br />I like the duel - between best friends the best. It heroic and fun and upbeat and rythmic all in one. The track or cue is called \\"Crossed Swords\\".<br /><br />His other scores include The In-Laws, The Time Machine (Remake), Hanibal, K-19, Catwoman and Constantine.<br /><br />Working with Hans Zimmer, Badelt contributed music to the Oscar-nominated scores for Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000), Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line (1998) and Dreamworks' The Prince Of Egypt. Klaus collaborated with Zimmer on the music for Mission: Impossible II (2000) with producer Tom Cruise and director John Woo, Ridley Scott's Hannibal (2001) and Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor (2001). He also co-wrote the score to Sean Penn's The Pledge (2001) with Zimmer.<br /><br />This is definately a passionate score - especially if you like strings and percussion.! 11-06
B000002UR7|5.0|This is a great album, but even if you only buy it for \\"Creep\\" it is well worth it. \\"Creep\\" is one of those odd, hard to catagorize, one of a kind songs that you'll find yourself singing all day long!
B000GFLE86|4.0|Having been listening to Medeleine Peyroux since her debut album it is great to see this singer keep producing such wonderful products. Easy on the ears and good choice of material for her. A very sophisticated lady. <br />
B00004RHZU|3.0|I purchased Pink's later three albums before I picked this one up. I really like Try This and I'm Not Dead, both are really solid albums and show how Pink has matured as an artist. Can't Take Me Home is not a bad album just doesn't compare well with the later work.
B000FIMG68|4.0|As said in the title, while it gets sometimes a bit too much into craziness, this is still an outstanding season. It will be difficult to wait for season 3.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|This album is wonderful. It has all of the best songs from all of the best movies over the years, like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. I bought it to go along with the sheet music book. It is a fun cd to listen to when cleaning the house.
0684824906|5.0|I probably read this book at the ideal time, for I was discouraged about the political situation and this book provided both solace and inspiration.  If it happened once, that the people were rescued by someone with vision, it can happen again.  Maybe it was not just a coincident that once I'd finished the book, I stumbled on all the laudatory articles on Obama, and realized he seems the closest of any of our political aspirants to the kind of self-knowlege and consequent recognition of his own fallibility that so characterized Lincoln's ability to not only use, but more, to inspire those who had been his earlier rivals.  We can't give up hope, and this book helps.
B0000C6K09|5.0|This a great present for people who love movies and music. Everytime I hear his songs, I can picture the movies the songs were in. It is just a really nice album that can bring back a lot of memories.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Great CD to listen to!  Takes you back in time with a lot of great hits.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This a great series especially for scifi buffs. Its a unique series that has the favor of the old west in space. I highly recommmend this DVD set to anyone looking for good entertainment that you can watch over and over again. This is a classic.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|This is really just a great cd, so different from a lot of music out there which is not that good. Grohl is a great singer and songwriter. Buy it-you won't regret it.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie just brings memories of my own life and family experiences. It was also shot in my hometown where I have great memories as well. The last scene is shot literally down the street from my house.  <br /> <br />Great acting, very funny, but behind the comedy there is a very real feeling to this movie.  <br /> <br />The score is great, one of the best by Mychael Danna & Devotchka. <br /> <br />I'm still waiting to watch it with that certain someone! This movie is very special to me. I saw it four time in the theaters during a critical time in my life. I'll always be attached to this movie & I'm getting it the first day it comes out! :)
B0000AFX64|5.0|It is fun to see the similarities and differences between the two versions.  I recommend it highly.
0061122416|5.0|This is the best book i have read in a long time.  Try Jack Rabbit Factor as well.
B000GTLQXU|3.0|I have seen the original \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" 155 times.  It is my favorite movie of all time.  I was very excited to find out that it was going to be remade.   <br /> <br />The trailers for \\"Poseidon\\" were excellent.  I waited five impatient months to see the movie when it came out in May 2006.  My best friend took me to see it at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.  There were 23 people in the theatre.  This was the first sign that something might be wrong. <br /> <br />The capsizing scene special effects were excellent.  The DVD included commentaries about rogue waves.  They stated that the capsizing scene in \\"Poseidon\\" was very accurate and is what they would expect to see happen in the event a ship was struck by a rogue wave. <br /> <br />However, the excellent capsizing scene could not save the rest of the movie.  Disappointment is the only word I can use to describe the movie. <br /> <br />Unrealistic characters.  Unsympathetic characters.  Lack of chemistry.  Preposterous situations. <br /> <br />At least the movie had Richard Dreyfus.  He alone saved this movie from being an utter disappointment.  <br /> <br />P.S. My best friend fell asleep.  <br /> <br />
B00014TJ7K|5.0|It certainly holds strong claims. George Harrison, with the able support of his superstar music buddies, was in the mood to deliver an album that was warmly recieved by his long time fans. <br /> <br />The album was a hit, the single topped the Billboard Charts and Harrison seemed keen to take an uncharacteristic role in promoting his new work extensively and seemed relaxed, happy and gracious radio and MTV were giving him exposure to levels he hadn't experienced since the Beatles and his early solo career. <br /> <br />In 1982, George released \\"Gonne Troppo\\" which nobody outside his loyal fanbase cared about. Critics dismissed him and alot of people were scratching their heads. George was enjoying life and that album was merely a postcard, as the album art hinted at. George was raising a family, gardening, working with film and visiting his tropical retreats away from the public eye and music business. <br /> <br />Being out of the spotlight for those years one can realise how the release and success of Cloud Nine was viewed as a comeback. Even more impressive is that George Harrison's rearrangement of the old Rudy Clark number, \\"I Got My Mind Set On You\\" shot to #1 and could be seen on MTV or heard on radio at any time of the day elevating Harrison the title of \\"born again pop star\\" a tag he laughed off as most of the press were loonies. <br /> <br />The album iteslf still plays well from start to finish, not a weak track in sight, each had single written all over it thanks to Jeff Lynne's style which managed to find a winning balance with George's dry vocals, breathtaking melodies and spirited and joyous lyrics which made the songs his most commercially accessable which no doubt helped in pushing this album to a wide audience. <br /> <br />\\"Cloud 9\\" quickly locks into a bluesy groove with some great guitar playing from George and Eric Clapton.  <br /> <br />Followed is the song \\"If That's What It Takes\\" which is one of the most uplifting pop songs with an incredible melody. It is a delight having a trademark Harrison slide solo and then closing with an emotional slowhandstyle solo from Clapton. <br /> <br />\\"Fish On The Sand\\" is a spirited fast paced pop/rocker that has Lynne's trademark rhythm and late 80's production with some clever lyrics from George. <br /> <br />The minor key ballad, \\"Just for Today\\" features Elton John on piano and the lyrics George took from an AA brochure. The song has a positive message that is prevalant in the theme of the album in general. Slide guitar is majestic here. <br /> <br />Speaking of hopeful, positive music, \\"This Is Love\\" is a shining example. The was a fantastic video shot in Hawaii to promote this, the 3rd single of the album. It is one of the very best from this album. Some great singing and slide guitar from George. <br /> <br />\\"When We Was Fab\\" is a fascinating look back to the Beatles days, it is cryptic, hilarous and I agree with the other reviewer in that it beats the pants of many a Beatle song. It has some \\"naughty chords\\" in it and it's arrangement ensures the melody will live with the listner forever. A fab video was cooked up for this patische. Another very good song from the album. <br /> <br />\\"Devils Radio\\" the idea for the song came from a church billboard George drove past taking his son to school. Combine this with George's views about the media, the hounding pack of wolves they are, and how the world is going crazy, and you have a catchy little pop rocker that uses a good measure Georges sense of humour. This is the sort of song George would often do on his less popular albums, the theme either religion or untrustworthy people. <br /> <br />\\"Someplace Else\\" is a sweeping ballad, everybit as good as Paul's from the 70's and 80's that was featured in the film Shanghai Suprise. <br /> <br />George sounds like Dylan on \\"Wreck of the Hesperus\\" as he and Eric cook up a bluesy rocking storm with more of Georges humour. <br /> <br />\\"Breath Away From Heaven\\" has some brilliant lyrics from George, that is the only redeeming feature to save this song from being called a clunker, it is a little slow, long and repetative in its musical structure but listen to the words. <br /> <br />\\"Got My Mind Set On You\\" is a very catchy song that people either loved or got annoyed by. A little bit like songs that are killed by overplay, oh to have that problem. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are good for Harrison fans, nothing special to note. <br /> <br />Get this album, pop/rock has never been dished up as clever, as catchy, as spirited, as enlightening and as professionally crafted as Cloud Nine. <br /> <br />It truly ranks with the essential George albums that include the greatest, \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and the just as good last album, \\"Brainwashed\\". Get \\"George Harrison\\" \\"33 and 1/3\\" then \\"Dark Horse\\". For the casual or new fan The only albums you could live without are \\"Extra Texture\\" \\"Somewhere In England\\" and \\"Gonne Troppo\\" which many longtime fans, like me, adore. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000301YY8|4.0|Great Album.  A few favourite songs were \\"So Long Jimmy\\"  A soulful tribute to Jimi Hendrix---( a guess)  Very clever weaving of Jimi's song/album titles into the lyrics,  and \\"Goodbye\\"  A great break-up/funerary/moving on tune.
1878424319|5.0|I loved this book, so I bought another to give it as a gift to a good friend, and she loves it too!!  It is a very insightful and inspiring book.
0670034711|4.0|Laugh out loud funny, well, the first section mainly. Then it gravitates to deeper issues. This book is about a spiritual quest. But it's readable and welcoming! I'm usually not into reading spiritual books. I could never get even through the first page of most.<br /><br />But not this one. Ms. Gilbert writes from her heart and is willing to share every bit of herself, which I'm not exactly sure why she would, and I don't think she is quite sure either but she committed to writing the piece, no matter what. I respect and appreciate that on many levels.
B00005O3VC|3.0|This one drags a bit.  It's amuzing but moves slowly.  The DVD was delivered on time and in excellent condition.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost is always a welcome addition to my DVD collection. I did enjoy the second season even though the first was superior. I feel the answered a handful of questions and yes, they drag things out but who wants Lost to fall under the curse of Twin Peaks? Not Me. I love the show and love to theorize on what's happening and what I think is yet to happen. If you're not watching Lost yet you should be, it's addicting! <br /> <br />The DVD set is well worth it, I always love the blooper reels, and of course, Kate/Evangeline Lilly!
0380789019|5.0|Gaiman has an unusual ability to make you simply accept things that are not real, but are close enough that you slip into them easily.  This is the second book I've read by him and found it to be a delight.  I actually read it several months ago and have found that it's a book that stays with you well after you've finished it.
B000I5X81K|3.0|If you looked up Josh Groban fan in the dictionary, there my picture would be!  I was so looking forward to this CD and even paid the 30.00 dollars to get the special edition cut. <br /> <br />I'm sad to say I'm disappointed.  Aside from a few songs, I thought the rest were mainly dark, depressing and all sounded a lot alike.  I miss the singable melodies (David Foster's stronger influence on previous CD's?). <br /> <br />I would listen to Josh sing the phonebook, but I miss the sounds of previous CD's.  My husband has never heard Josh (can you believe it?).So, he came in the room when I had the new CD playing and after a while said, \\"Geez, this sounds like music to slit your wrists by.\\" <br /> <br />And,Josh, if you're reading this, I'm so sad you're not coming to Kansas City next year on tour.  I thought we did you proud last time you were here!  Any chance of changing your mind?
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This album is Enya-style, no doubt.  Great background sound, but not as mezmerizing as earlier albums.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Bought Season 1 DVDs last year and added to my collection with Season 2 in September.  I will most definitely be buying Season 3 as soon as it's available.  I LOVE THIS SHOW!!! <br /> <br />Pre-ordered the DVDs during the summer and Amazon delivered them within a week of their being released in September.  Very happy with purchase and with Amazon's service.
0596007124|5.0|This book takes a novel approach to the topic of design patterns and presents it in a manner which is anything but boring. The bottom line: it's a well written book and makes digesting this topic interesting.    I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn more about design patterns.    Although it is written with Java in mind, if you have an understanding of basic OOP programming then this book should make sense to you. There are also resources available online that have translated the examples into [...].
1569242739|5.0|I am not a vegan, but I loved Vegan with a Vengeance...and I couldn't wait for VCTOTW -- this book is awesome. So far I've only made the basic vanilla cupcakes but the frosting alone (vegan buttercream and the chocolate buttercream -- couldn't resist making both) was worth the price of the cookbook and MORE! And, to top it all off, I made the first batch in honor of my son's birthday and neither of my kids even blinked an eye to notice that these cupcakes were anything other than YUMMY!<br /><br />P.S. I have always been intimidated by cupcakes (and especially frosting) -- but these recipes made it all seem easier, somehow.
B00005RDRO|4.0|This is a great little spoof on mystery writers. A star studded cast. Most enjoyable family entertainment and worth watching more than once.
B000002UCN|5.0|Great CD with all of his best songs.  Makes me realize how much I miss the music.
B000F7CMQ8|5.0|What a wonderful \\"great white hunter\\" movie!! Of course the sultry Ava Gardner plays the perfect bad girl to Gables manly man with Grace Kelly rounding out the innocent. The movie may be old but the them is timeless.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the Second Season of LOST - in fact I watched all of it over a couple of days!  For those of you confused by Season Three, and wondering, what are they thinking and why am I watching this, its nice to go back to Season Two and relive the great episodes that hooked you on LOST.
B000024ASD|4.0|It's been over a decade since I last owned this album, but it had the same impact now as it did then. <br />Each song has that unique electronica 'zap' from one track to the next. The bridges between the songs are pretty humourous as well. <br />From the first track (\\"Love Missile F-111\\") to the last (\\"She's My Man\\"), Sigue Sigue Sputnik serves up a dish that any fan of Cyberpunk, Anime, comic-book superheroes, and over-sexed media can enjoy over and over. <br />I give it four stars, especially for the tracks \\"Teenage Thunder\\", \\"Sex-Bomb-Boogie\\", \\"21st Century Boy\\", and \\"Massive Retaliation\\". <br />It's an ultra-chic thrill ride.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is great.  Roger Waters pretty much wrote the whole thing.  You can feel his vibe in this one and it's more prevalent than ever before.  He was starting to take over at this time.  The Wall and The Final Cut are the other two of his trilogy.  Look out for the flying pig.
B0009A40ES|5.0|the movie is amazing, one of my favorites, but most importantly, the condition in which i received it was immaculate; there were no scratches, no blemishes, and the case was fully intact. thank you so much for selling such a quality product. hope to do business with you in the future.
B000002U9Y|5.0|An incredible psychodelic journey from the end of Syd Barrett's time in the Floyd, to the time of his replacement and friend David Gilmore, who stepped in to help out for a while (so he thought).  David ends up replacing him permanently after Syd's meltdown.  It ain't Dark Side, or The Wall, or Wish You Were Here, but it's the roots of the original Pink Floyd.  It's the rest of the band trying to write and take over for a Syd who has lost it from taking too much LSD.  Jug band blues obviously says it all.  It's classic and a must have for any Floyd fan.
B000007ODL|5.0|The CD brings much pleasure and happiness. The music is splendid.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|I was turned on to this show after discovering that Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy, Angel, Firefly/Serenity--and my personal hero) was a huge fan and after just a few episodes of Season 2, I was so hooked I immediately bought Season 1 so that I could catch up and understand some of the relationships. <br /> <br />Most people are going to roll their eyes and/or shut down at the mere mention of a show where the main characters are teens, but believe me, this show is not to be missed...period!!!  The writing is smart and funny, the characters complex and endearing (some inexplicibly).  Season 2's shocking ending is something I strongly doubt ANYONE truly saw coming. <br /> <br />Honestly, I thought I was done with \\"high school shows\\", after Buffy ended, so in that sense I can relate to the general reaction to this show by the average adult.  If it weren't for Joss's recommendation, I never would've discovered this wonderful series and I am beyond glad that I did!
B000FMGTTE|5.0|I loved the music.  How can you go wrong with John Williams as the original composer.  I think this music is spectacular.  It compliments Williams' score from 1978 and brings it into the current movie wonderfully.  I highly recommend it.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|If you share my view that Bob Dylan is better by far than any other living song writer you will find more proof for that when you listen to Modern Times. I have been listening to Bob since I was thirteen years old when I heard Blowing in the Wind on the radio. Bob promises to be with someone when the deal goes down on this CD. It strikes me as a perfect phrase for someone who carries the weight of many long years spent in our sadly modern times when commerce has taken on the central focus in our culture. If one is promised in commercial terms that something will happen it expresses the seriousness of the promise but also the sorrow one might feel in having to use a monetary metaphor to talk of love.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|The incendiary guitar of Marty Friedman gives this record a unique personality (Hangar 18, Holy Wars..., Take no Prisioners, Lucretia and Tornado of Souls) . Those tremendous riffs are a symbol of what a heavy metal guitar player must be from there to now on.<br /><br />Nick Menza's drums are very precise and creative, specially in the intro of Dawn Patrol...<br /><br />Dave Mustaine's lyrics are at their highest point in this album.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the best album from Megadeth...<br /><br />Highly recomendable!
B000J103PC|4.0|This is a very entertaining film that explores many of the situations that young adults must master on their way to understanding themselves and their goals in life.  Primarily this means how to balance work demands and the demands of family and friends. I personally think that the years following college graduation and the first successes and failures in business help a young adult clarify their values and the path or direction they wish to take their life. In this regard, The Devil Wears Prada, is right on the money.  <br /> <br />Anne Hathaway does a great job playing recent college graduate, Andrea, who takes a job as second assistant to a highly demanding supervisor. Meryl Streep, as editor Miranda Priestly, does a superb job of playing a driven, workaholic, creative power-broker in the fashion industry. Strep's performance was captivating yet not 'over the top'. She never was a cartoon witch, just incredibly demanding and self absorbed. The fact that Meryl Streep can take a character that is totally unique and bring out the vulnerable human qualities attests to her superior acting skills. Watching Streep play the Machiavellian diva is worth the price of the DVD. <br /> <br />So what happens to little innocent Andrea? She gradually takes the challenge of trying to please the totally unpleasable Miranda. She gradually masters her job and the field of fashion. She also gradually begins to edge out first assistant, Emily Blunt. Blunt is also superb as she trys to imitate her hateful boss, yet always a softer side comes through. Handsome Daniel Sunjata plays a young designer, dependent on Miranda's good graces and opionion. He is willing to change an entire line of his designs to please her. <br /> <br />Simon Baker as a jet set journalist, Stanley Tucci as Miranda's second in command, and Adrian Grenier as Anne's college boy friend, Nate, all allow Andrea to see herself as other see her and as she is gradually becoming. Andrea is almost lost, until she discovers that Miranda's position is in jeapardy, and she comes to the loyal defense of a woman most folks consider to be a monster. But Miranda was already aware of the coup, and is willing to double cross her second in command to remain in power. Andrea gets a glimps into the driven inside dynamics of Miranda and at some point realizes she doesn't want this future - even if she may have the instict and brains for such a world. In the end, Andrea makes the right moves, she does not fall for the chaos and competition, and gets her life and love back.  <br /> <br />You will remain entertained by the beautiful cast, Hathaway and Streep's superb performances, and the stunning designer clothes Hathaway shows us throughout the second half of the film. <br /> <br />
0066620996|5.0|One of the best findings of this book for me was that those great enterprises  do not tend to invest vast sums in \\"motivation programs\\" to keep their employees on board. What they have applied is either take it or leave it philosophy - you either WANT the job badly and you love your company because it's great and your company loves you because your bring tangible results or you DON'T WANT it and you're out. We have implemented several motivation schemes in our company recently, with a package of social benefits still to come. However I am in doubt if this will make those who have grumbled so far stay and motivate them to become overachievers... We have therefore decided that except for what has already been agreed no other motivation schemes will be applied and that our efforts now will focus on making people love their jobs and work best to their abilities. Sounds idealistic but seemingly the best choice.
0060594888|5.0|By far, this is the best personal development book I've ever read. Inspirational and insightful. Will likely become the most well-read, tattered and worn book on my shelf.
B000929AJQ|5.0|this in my opinion is one of the best CD's that Trent Reznor has put together.
B0002NRQTS|5.0|I love this album. In fact, it's probably behind only Hold Your Fire, Power Windows, and Hemispheres in my favorites (but don't count on that. As you can see in my reviews, my favorites change like the weather.), but its production gives it no oomph. For instance, let's look at the entry of the guitars into Show Don't Tell. It should punch you in the gut, but instead it just taps you on the shoulder and says \\"Hey there...\\" It's not really Rush's fault, Rupert Hine just doesn't have a style that would fit Rush. It may fit lighter bands like Genesis, but definitely not a band like Rush. <br /> <br />Now that the production gripe is over with, now we can get to the music and lyrics. This is quite a unique album. Roll The Bones is different in the fact that it all keeps a moderate volume and tempo, but this one changes a lot. There's the energetic songs like Show Don't Tell, Chain Lightning, and  Superconductor, but then there are also quiet, more introspective, quiet songs like The Pass and Available Light. The two that I just mentioned are some of the most emotional songs Rush ever put out. The Pass really blows you away lyrically, as does Available Light. They've also got musical genious behind them. They're really two potentially life-altering songs, especially the former. You wouldn't expect this from an album with multitudes of bunnies on the cover, but in this case it's more than meets the eye. <br /> <br />Would you me to break it down song-by-song? <br /> <br />1. Show Don't Tell -10/10- Starts the album with what should've been a bang, but was more of a loud tap. If you were to add a ton of bass and volume to it, it would make you look like the guy getting blown back in the chair on that one logo. (sorry for the lack of dignity.) <br /> <br />2. Chain Lightning -10/10- The production isn't too bad here, it's very energetic, much like Show Don't Tell. <br /> <br />3. The Pass -15/10- This one hits you hard. It can change your life. Listen to it NOW if you haven't heard it yet. <br /> <br />4. War Paint -8.5/10- I thought it was awesome the first time, but it gets old. But hey, they can't make every song a classic, right? <br /> <br />5. Scars -10/10- Danceable. Amazing. The bassline and drums especially make you want to just start dancing. It's sooooo strange, it's totally unlike anything else in the Rush catalogue. <br /> <br />6. Presto -11/10- Shows some of the magic of this album. You won't appreciate this song a lot at first, but it grows pretty quickly. <br /> <br />7. Superconductor -10/10- The first song I've ever heard that's mostly in 7/4 time that I could probably play at a school dance with positive response. The difference between this and most of the drivel they play is that this stuff is good. <br /> <br />8. Anagram -9/10- Cool lyrics, but otherwise it's just okay. <br /> <br />9. Red Tide -9/10- Alarmist lyrics, okay music. <br /> <br />10. Hand Over Fist -8.5/10- They're obviously saving up SOMETHING for us. This song's okay, but nothing special. <br /> <br />11. Available Light -12/10- BAM!!! Here it is, the awesome ending. The lyrics, the music... It all teams up for something super-special. There's piano, synth, bass, guitar, and drums. All from three people. Plus, there's about 200 peoples' worth of emotion in it. Holy cow. <br /> <br />Overall: 9.99/10. Great CD. I can't give it a 10 because not every song is perfect.If you're new to Rush, I'll refer you to Permanent Waves or Moving Pictures. If you have 5 albums or more, by all means pick this up. This is the last one I bought, and much to my regret. It's amazing.
0143058592|5.0|Start with the reader having a very very British accent and add the magic that was (is) The Beatles and you have a audio book that often had me staying in my car just to finish a chapter. For the superfan, not a ton of new info on the boys (although the story about Yoko taking George's biscuits was golden) but hearing about the recording sessions from Geoff Emerick's perspective was well worth the price of admission.
B000002I6V|5.0|Graham Nash is still going strong and is a wonderful songwriter!  I loved this album and his music when I was younger and love it just as much TODAY..
1881273156|4.0|This could have been a feature article in a magazine with the test at the end, but it's a book with so much fluff that I ended up scanning a lot of it.  Anyway, the idea of the \\"love languages\\" I believe has a lot of truth.  I'm glad I read this book and I suppose if it will save some marriages it's worth going through the fluff.
0553103547|5.0|This book was probably the most realistic and well-written fantasy I've ever read. It far surpasses Lord of the Rings and creates a world that is completely engrossing. The narrative style is interesting, for all chapters are told from just a few different characters' points of view. There is little to no cliche and every event is believable. If you're looking for a fantasy book to read, this is it no question.
0143034901|5.0|in that wonderful slow moving, half reality - half fantasy Spanish tradition.<br /><br />Beautiful use of language and imagery.
B000000OAA|5.0|Often overshadowed by A Night At the Opera, this is one terrific album. All of the famous Queen sounds that made them a force in the 70's are already in place here. \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" is a great rocker. \\"Now I'm Here\\" is top notch. This album is kind of a mini Abbey Road, with short songs linked together (\\"Tenament Funster,\\" \\"Flick Of The Wrist,' \\"Lily of the Valley.\\") If you don't have this album, your Queen collection is not complete.
B000051VWW|5.0|ROCK INDEED!  This CD is great; when I first rec'd it I played it while I cleaned my house.  Time and work breezed by as I enjoyed the music.  Perfect; not loud and overwhelming yet not to soft.  I love it.  I've also played it while entertaining guest; everybody loved it.  Although I already had the Lover's Live DVD, I had to sit in front of the TV to fully enjoy it.  The CD allowed me to do other things while still enjoying the music.
B000000OAN|5.0|The true sign of a classic album, and make no mistake, this is a classic, is how it compares to the albums of its day, and how it stands the test of time. A Night At The Opera succeeds on both counts. While over 30 years old, it has held up very well. \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" of course remains one of a kind. Everything else here is top notch too. Incredibly, 30 years later, this album is STILL ahead of its time.
B0000047CX|5.0|This is another artist/arranger who shaped my childhood. My father was totally into the Afro-Cuban movement in jazz (thanks to Dizzy & company). He also loved Stan Getz. So a Getz/Joao Gilberto collaboration (arranged by Gil Evans) was a must-have in our home. <br /> <br />Everyone is familiar with the \\"Girl From Ipanema,\\" and Joao's ethereal vocals in Portugese and Astrud's bright, clean vocals in English just make this a beauty. Add Getz' sensual saxophone riffs and Gil Evans' arrangements and you're in heaven. Enough said!
B0000067L2|5.0|I distinctly remember hearing \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" when it first came out (can it really be almost 40 years??) I had never heard anything like it before. I actually didn't even think it was an electric guitar, because I had never heard a guitar played like that before. Well...now it's 2006, and the song still blows me away! By far the best Cream album. It amazes me how good these songs still are. Give this one a listen again. These songs have definitely stood the test of time.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Veronica Mars has staying power.  Proving that the sophmore slump can be beat, season 2 has more compelling twists and turns than season 1.  The cast dynamics are even tighter in season 2, showcasing the well-oiled machine the cast has become.  This smart high-school drama where adults play a vital role in events large and small is must see TV in our household. <br /> <br />If you haven't started watching this show yet, start from season 1 or you'll miss a lot, but definitely start watching this smart, funny, and engrossing drama.  It's got lots to recommend it to viewing audiences of all ages. <br /> <br />The season 2 DVDs are a great way to relive the season or get caught up with this show which is in the midst of its third engrossing season.  I would highly recommend this DVD set, because it is definitely worth multiple viewings.
B000000OAC|4.0|Queen's mega-albums were, in order of release, A Night At The Opera, A Day At The Races, and News Of The World. Personally, I've always ranked this a shade behind Opera and a shade ahead of Races. It has the gigantic \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are The Champions,\\" but there are a lot of great songs here you don't hear too often. My favorites are \\"Sheer Heart Attack,\\" \\"It's Late,\\" and \\"Sleeping On The Sidewalk.\\" All in all, a great album.
0807130087|4.0|I loved it. The characters are real, yet no one wants to believe such people exist, or that they have these characteristics themselves. Very funny in places.
6305327041|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. I'm so glad I have it on DVD now. With the all-star cast, and great writing by Terintino you know its boud to be good! There are 4 rooms that a bellhop has to go to over the course of New Year's Eve night. You see the different things he goes through and how his night ends. If you want to laugh allot....this is the movie to get!
B0007M22TI|5.0|I've watched this 5 times in the past month by sharing it with everybody. Even my country/western fan son loved it.
B000IU3XTW|4.0|It would be 5 stars if it were a double album with all the songs--which is basically what everyone else here is saying.  This Amazon price is the best I've seen so far on-line, but iTunes sells the album for a few cents more, and they throw in \\"Ain't It the Life\\" as a bonus track.  I'm looking forward to the DVD, which should hopefully have the full set of songs.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I LOVE this CD altho I do have one complaint. I wish the lyrics to the songs were included in the printed material.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|An outstanding film. Great adaptation to the big screen of one of the finest TV series. Well written, directed and acted. Two thumbs up.
B00065GX64|5.0|M is a wonderful piece of early sound cinema. It is Peter Lorre's first film and he portrays a chilling yet pathetic man who commits such heinous crimes. It is beautifully made by director Fritz Lang. Both Lorre and Lang would go on to make their mark in Hollywood film history.   <br />The film is beautifully restored. After years of poor quality VHS releases, I found this DVd to be of very high quality. It is nice to finally see this film intact and the interview with Fritz Lang is a treat. This is a must for collectors of classic cinema.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This series has a lot of potential.  After a roaring beginning, it did become a bit bland in the middle, especially episode Route 666, but picked right back up and finished with the brilliant Salvation and Devil's Trap.  I recommend this series, especially those in the US as you know have the benefit of Season 2!   <br /> <br />Hope this series carries on for a few more series. <br /> <br />10/10 from me.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|After 30 years of listening to Pink Floyd and owning many of their vinyl albums as well as the CDs, I never have seen them perform. Viewing this DVD of their 1994 London concert was a big treat to finally see these guys play. The light and laser show is magnificent. <br />I liked the first disc the most. Their performance of these songs is amazing. The second disc, which is Dark Side of the Moon, I liked, but not as much as the original recording. Just a personal thing. <br />I highly recommend this DVD to not only Pink Floyd fans but to those who just appreciate great rock and genius guitar work by David Gilmour.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|<br />First of all, it is important to understand that we never went to the moon. The Apollo project was a hoax.  <br />I won't try to prove anything to you in this review, but I will recommend the documentary film, Astronauts Gone Wild. In the film, the film-maker confronts eight of the living astronauts who claim to have traveled to the moon. It is clear from their reactions (especially Buzz Aldrin's) that they did not go to the moon.  <br />Buzz Aldrin comes very close (in my opinion) to actually admitting that it was a hoax. Judge for yourself. <br /> <br />I am giving this mini-series (From the Earth to the Moon) a five star rating because it confirms without question in my mind that we never went to the moon. So it is a must see for anyone who is looking into the Apollo Hoax. Don't get me wrong. This is a very boring mini-series.  I literally fell asleep several times trying to get through disc 1. <br /> <br />But this mini-series is important because it brings up important questions. Here are a few questions that come to mind:  <br />Who in Hollywood knows that the Apollo project was a hoax?  <br />Is Tom Hanks a criminal for making this film, or is he just another person who has been fooled into believing that we really went to the moon?  <br />Is producer Ron Howard a criminal? <br />Who should be investigated? Who should be arrested?  <br /> <br />In light of the fact that the Apollo project was a hoax, it is reasonable to guess that the crew of Apollo 1 (Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee) were murdered. They were probably murdered because they knew first-hand how absurd the idea of making it to the moon within the decade was. They were, most likely, being silenced. This is a reasonable theory. <br /> <br />Episode 2 in this mini-series deals with Apollo 1. After watching this episode, I am convinced that those Apollo 1 astronauts were murdered, and this film is intentionally trying to cover up the murders. So the big question (if this theory is correct) is: Who (in the production of this film) needs to be investigated and arrested for trying to cover up the murders of three astronauts?
B00005MM01|5.0|A very happy CD that depicts an era when there was some optimism in music.  This is a double album.  The first part is so 60's; you want to say Groovy and Neat-O again. <br /> <br />The second part is very accoustic and poetic.  This part was one I listened to as a child and was glad to hear again.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|Josh Groban has done it again. This third album shows Josh's growth as an artist, and surpasses the other two albums. They just keep getting better. Bravo!
B000065U1N|4.0|Excellent movie, made you feel like you were in the middle of the action. Keeps you on the edge of your seat even when you know the ending.
0743298020|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's not just the plot, which is fascinating and extremely reminiscent of Bronte or Austen with a darker edge, but the writing itself. Setterfield must have spent a long time fashioning each and every sentence and it shows. Her world swallows you - once and then again. I hope she write more and soon!
0802130208|5.0|I cannot think of a funnier novel written in the last century.  If Toole were still with us, he'd be the Mark Twain of New Orleans.

B000EMGAOY|4.0|Very good album, some filler, but for the most part...it was very good. Saw the live show as well (3rd time seeing them)...much more energy this time round than in recent live performances and albums...
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|If you love John Waters then you're already right there with me.  I would classify this as a bit tame compared to his other offings and similar in style and irony to the movie Grease but is a more self-aware film. <br /> <br />I love rooting for the Drapes and the idea that the Squares can become Drapes, which, thematically, seems to be a Waterian theme - that we can all get along if we have sex with each other.  Which is probably true John. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, and Johnny Depp is young here and cool and I think you will enjoy seeing both Ricki Lake and Tracy Lords and Willem Dafoe as well (I know I did).
B000F48CD8|5.0|these guys really bring new life into the music world, I think that they offer a unique perspective with sounds in a combination of the white stripes and the beatles, they'll please all fans...
B0000C8AVE|5.0|Bob Dylan, the 60's, I was there and this album takes me back.
0689825498|5.0|I bought the book for my 2 yr. old.  He likes it a lot.  He really likes animals and has fun making animal sounds. I would recommend it for little kids.
B000FDECGA|5.0|When I was a kid living in the suburbs of NYC, my Dad carted me and my brother to a small, out-of-the-way movie theater--we entered the darkened theater near the end of the film and as I looked up at the screen, I saw the image of a samurai warrier pounding his iron claw into the sand as the ground started to ooze red.  I was blown away.  We stayed for the next show and from the beginning with that crazy kid's narration track, you get sucked into a primal world where guys with wheelburrow size hats can kill with the greatest of ease. <br /> <br />This is an over-the-top, slugfest that hits the mark like nothing else on the home video horizon.  You've got your ninjas.  You've got your baby carriage with knives that pop out of the wheels to decapitate.  You've got your crazy female assasins who can run backwards and turn into a blip in a second and a half.  You've got so much crazy, wacked out fighting sequences that it defies logic. <br /> <br />Yes, absolutely the full Lone Wolf and Cub series is the way to go.  But, this baby is absolutely worth the time.  Think of it as the greatest hits splatter and slice tracks from the full-length episodes.  When I'm down and through with the way the real world works, this baby is the one I put in the old CD-player to get my head back to center. <br /> <br />So, if you've seen Kill Bill--then you know the scene at the end of KB2 where the Bride is laying down with her daughter in Bill's bed.  Originally, the video that she was going to watch was Disney's the Aristocats--as an homage to the Pulp Fiction days when Uma and QT dreamed up the revenge plot line.  Well, Disney wimped out and refused to grant permission.  So, you'll hear the soundtrack of our favorite chophouse film SHOGUN ASSASSIN play on the kid's tv set.  Nice choice. <br /> <br />Put a big check mark next to this one.  And, show your friends--but not their wives (unless they're really cool)...
0393327655|3.0|Sam Harris presents an interesting study of faith and religion. It reinforced many of the thoughts I had on religion in particular.The only complaint I have with the book is that it's heavily footnoted. Which is typical for an academic I suppose, but makes it laborious to read.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|A cure has been discovered to help mutants be normal if they chose it, unfortunately it has made Magneto (Ian Mckellen) furious as hell as he recruits some of his deadly mutants to put a stop to it. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) whom thought she was left for dead in the previous picture has been resurrected but filled with dark powers as the powerful and evil Dark Phoenix as she joins up with Magneto to enslave humanity once and for all, but can Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) along with the X-Men (Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Halle Berry, Shawn Ashmore, James Marsden) with three new members Kitty Pryd (Ellen Page), Beast (Kelsey Grammer) and Angel (Ben Foster) stop the war from happening?<br /><br />This is the final installment of the popular \\"X-Men\\" trilogy, the film is kind of weak compared to the awesome first two installments. But there is plenty of good action sequences, some humor, more wolverine action, emotion, and new mutants like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) as the director of \\"Rush Hour\\" Brett Ratner takes over Bryan Singer's spot for director to take this final installment to a new direction. It's a weak but very good end to a great Marvel comic movie series until a few character spin-offs come along like \\"Wolverine\\" and \\"Magneto\\".<br /><br />This DVD has great picture & sound with some good extras like two audio commentaries and deleted scenes.<br /><br />It's still worth owning if you loved the first two movies or comic based movies.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Oh, how I love Audrey Hepburn. If you are a fan and have not seen this one, its a must see! She is as captivationg as ever, and actually won an Oscar for her role, and this was her first major film. Gregory Peck is handsome and cool. Its not your typical love story.<br /><br />Watch it!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This DVD is absolutely perfect!  This is the best Eagles concert you'll ever hear!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was as true to life as you can get. A dramatic, intense documentary about the Battle of the Bulge.  Any WWII veteran will appreciate the effort put into this production. Well worth the money
B000067CPX|4.0|This disc has got some great songs on it, By the Way, Can't Stop and some good songs.  The Zephyr song and Universally Speaking sound a lot alike but are really nice songs to relax and listen too.  Throw Away Your Television and Cabron are also fun songs.  The bass line that Flea invents on Throw Away Your Television is great and I like the idea behind the song.<br />  There are some fun songs, but overall the CD has a more thoughtful, almost depressed feel to it.  Venice Queen is a song for Anthony's late vocals mentor, yet still has a lot of life in it.  This CD shows many different angles that the Peppers can play from and is a must for a fan and anyone who likes the Red Hot kind of music.
0064430227|3.0|My son is 23 months old and we love this book.  It really is an imaginative story, with wonderful pictures and clever writing.

B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost is amazing! <br />the second season is even better than the first <br />i recommend it to everyone
0066620996|5.0|GREAT INFO TO KEEP ALL THE PLAYERS ON THE SAME GOAL AND PAGE.
B000002NHN|4.0|Loreena's music is haunting and melodic. Her voice has a soothing quality that is instantly relaxing.Some of the song content is too dark for my taste but the voice and music are wonderful.
B0000640VN|2.0|I can't recall any movie of Meg Ryan's where I disliked her character as much as in this movie.  She is irritating and looks like hell to boot.  Hugh Jackman is charming as Leopold but I kept thinking, \\"Why are you wasting your time on this not very interesting dingbat\\"?
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I own both and the 1995 DVD's picture & sound quality are the same.  They just repacked the movie with 60th anniversary banner.  There is no difference.  So if you don't have the 1995 DVD release this is a good item for you because they did a good job in 1995 and saved themselves money not having to retouch it up in 2006!
B00005K3NR|5.0|This review wont tell the story!    This is Sissy at her best - with a supporting cast you can only dream of.    Much more than a horror film, you will watch this movie many times.    Added value: Very interesting interviews with the actors on this DVD, about 25 years after the movie.
B000000H3W|5.0|I think its fair to compare Arise to maybe Beneath the Remains or the awesome Chaos AD, but unfair to compare it too other thrash albums.  This stuff destroys and lays to ruins all heavy metal acts on the planet.  That said, when I reach in my CD case for a sick thrash CD - I usually grab this one before Chaos or BTR.  This one is just retarded from beginning to end.  If you are reading this review.. run out jump in the car the drive 100 mph to the nearest record shop and PRAY they have it in stock.  Absolutely mind boggling stuff.
B000E8QVWY|1.0|i had given this a second star, but then i thought to myself: why? this movie is abominable. its not just the amateurish performance by joaquin phoenix as johnny cash -- i never thought anyone could sing flatter than the REAL cash -- or the squeaking by reese witherspoon as june carter. its the whole damned show! how often have you ever seen a musical when the songs actually STOPPED the action (i can only think of richard attenboroughs dreadful interpretation of \\"a chorus line\\")? but the REAL villain here is james mangold, the director who previously gave us that alltime classic \\"girl interrupted\\". its bad enough that hacks are given millions of dollars to make movies, but i urge you to listen to this guys commentary on the dvd; he is a pretentious jerk who honestly believes he has made a significant work of art. at least the hacks in old hollywood knew they were hacks and were willing to work within their weaknesses, thus often turning out fine professional work. this guy mangold is a moron -- the technique of a buffoon and the limited talent of an ed wood (without the freak show imagination). i cut this down from 2 stars to 1 because i resent that i gave up a few hours of my life to watch this stupid unprofessional ugly movie! <br />
B000000H4V|5.0|Chaos AD is simply a landmark in music history.  This stuff is so good for so many different reasons and is just a remarkable artistic statement.  I'm not sure I have ever heard something so completely unreal in terms of originality and execution.<br /><br />Honestly, the riffs employed here are just unfair and so sick its not funny.  Just down right unfair guys!<br /><br />Propaganda is my favorite.  That track is just sick.<br /><br />What a masterpiece.
B0007KTBIU|2.0|silly and insipid, and as grand as the resurrected animation department at disney was from \\"little mermaid\\" thru \\"aladdin\\" and \\"lion King\\" and \\"beauty & the beast\\", crud like this only reminded one of the era od \\"the black cauldron\\". <br />
B000GIWS7E|5.0|It is a very rare situation where 5 brilliant musicians, each a world-class performer in their own right, perform as a unit as well as Dream Theater.  Any fan of rock, or progressive rock (in the vein of Yes, The Who, Kansas, Styx or Queen) will be in awe of the performance this group stages at the sold-out Radio city Music Hall in NYC. The quality of the sound and camera work on this DVD is stunning.
0618680004|4.0|I recently read professor's Dawkins 'The God delusion'.It is a quite interesting book which resembles much professor's Harris 'The end of faith'.Dawkins is a well known atheist and in this book he expresses his hatred against all organised religion.I think that the objective of this book should be to criticize the politics of the church instead of attacking religion as a matter of faith.After all he is a scientist,not a philosopher,and it is better to leave the job of undermining religious belief to professional philosophers like Sobel or Martin.The reason i rate this book with 4 stars is that it highlights the dangers that are the result of religious fanaticism,which are quite evident in our era.I would suggest the book to everyone who is interested in finding out the disabuse of religious belief and its transformation to a possibly lethal weapon,but it is not the kind of book i would recommend to people who are interested in the philosophical foundations of religion.As a conclusion it is a quite good book but examines religion as far as its results and not its foundations are concerned.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|The film is poor on its images. It don't have the resolution I expected. The sound is in hig definition.
0312117337|5.0|Love this deck. Osho is absolutely amazing and these cards are artistically gorgeous as well as philosophically poignant. Every time I pull a card I am amazed at the synchronicity between my thoughts and the message reflected.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Just fantastic , brings rich comedy back with the same impact you saw this first time on TV.<br /><br />Ideal for repeat viewings any time of the day to cheer you up
B000089RVR|5.0|DIDO is amazing, every song on this album has depth and will speak to you.  It also brings out the sensual, yummy and juicy side of us all...
0440241413|3.0|At least there's some laughs at the primeval force that sends women shopping when they've run out of chocolate following relationship struggles.  Kinsella has a good light touch for the details and will no doubt stretch this one-line satire into several books that will make window shopping a suburban cult.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Rookie race car Lightning McQueen might \\"float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beamer,\\" but, at 116 minutes, CARS still took a leap of faith that it'd be able to hold the attention of its targeted rugrat audience. But, because this animated film is helmed by the Pixar folks (who apparently can do no wrong), CARS is diverting enough, oooh-inducing enough, and plot-worthy enough that the two hours mostly fly by in attentive bliss.<br /><br />The story and its message itself are nothing new - about how one should take the time to slow down, smell the flowers, and just aw-shucks appreciate life's awesomeness, and also how it's about the journey, not the destination...Trite, you say? Yes. But, you know what? Contrived and derivative though CARS's storyline may be, that time-worn message is still given brand new luster by the very credible and honest voice performances of the all-star cast and by the very outstanding and glossy animation provided by the Pixar Animation Studios. Owen Wilson (the cocky but inevitably likable Lightning McQueen), Paul Newman (the gruff Doc Hudson), and Larry the Cable Guy (that nutjob Tow Mater) are particularly wonderful in their roles; but every actor involved is nicely cast, including NASCAR legend Richard Petty as veteran race car champ The King.<br /><br />I appreciated and was moved by the movie's touching portrayal of the sparsely used Route 66 and its discarded mini-town Radiator Springs, which became forgotten when, to save an extra 10 minutes of driving, an interstate highway was built which bypassed it. This movie's world may be wholly populated by cars but one could certainly feel for the forlorn folks of Radiator Springs and their plight. The extra feature segment \\"Inspiration for CARS\\" delves more into Route 66 and its pit-stop towns that were left behind, which proved to be the basis for Radiator Springs.<br /><br />Special Features include 2 animated shorts: \\"Mater and the Ghost Light\\" (where everyone gets their revenge on the prank-pulling Mater) & the great \\"One Man Band,\\" CAR's full 4-minute-long epilogue shown without the end credits (where you can fully relish the automobile film versions of TOY STORY and MONSTER, INC.), the \\"Inspiration for CARS\\" segment with director John Lasseter, and over 10 minutes of deleted scenes.<br /><br />So, is CARS as good as Pixar's past monster hits? Heck, no. But CARS, on its own merit, is definitely worth watching. While it doesn't make you consistently laugh out loud, you'll get a chuckle here and there, and you'll end up having a good time. You might even feel a twinge of nostalgia or a pang of regret at the passing of a Route 66 that was at its heyday. Certainly, James Taylor's music helps to evoke those feelings. The voice cast plays their A-game, and, as usual with these Pixar cats, the animation is really something to behold. I had no idea automobiles could be so expressive and could garner such empathy. I went into this film when it first came out, thinking, \\"Huh, cars that talk. Okay...\\" But the movie did such a good job that when I walked out, I thought of these cars as real folks, though housed in steel, rubber, and a coat of paint. Doc, Mater, Sally, Guido, Luigi, Lightning McQueen...they're all good folks. So, yeah, man, by all means, let's go tractor-tipping. But, shhhh, don't let Frank catch you...rank-pulling Mater) & the great \\"One Man Band,\\" CAR's full 4-minute-long epilogue shown without the end credits (where you can fully relish the automobile film versions of TOY STORY and MONSTER, INC.), the \\"Inspiration for CARS\\" segment with director John Lasseter, and over 10 minutes of deleted scenes.<br /><br />So, is CARS as good as Pixar's past monster hits?

B000EQ4G5K|5.0|This cd is awesome and very up beat. I believe it is an album for a wide variety of people. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes up beat music.
B000001FKY|5.0|in 1987, before I accidentaly borrowed this album from a friend, I never an idea about rock or metal,  but this great album changed my music taste completely...
B000005YZM|5.0|This is the kind of music I listened to, when I was 16, 17, 18. And it was a totally nostalgic feeling to hear The Zombies again. At that time (in -64, -65) they were way ahead of the contemporary, ordinary (dull)pop-bands. Their voices and their harmonies were advanced (like The Beatles) and contained omens of future music. I played some of their music in my band then. (She's not there, Leave me be, Sticks and Stones)
B000002OVJ|5.0|An awesum album by the Who.I have an original copy bought new on vinyl.Always loved the sound,singing and playing.This cd contains 14 additional songs from the concert making it the complete concert and not a partial like the original.A must for who fans.If you never heard vintage Who give this a try I think you'll love it.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|What a truly stunning film, this type of film has been long overdue in the movie industry, more of these should see the light !
B00063F8B2|5.0|I went and saw this movie by myself. Oh, well, animation.<br /><br />Since I didn't know the story by heart, the whole plot was a nice surprise. The music actually caught my attention the most.<br /><br />Let's just forget Tom Hanks voice for a second, the excellent quality of song selection makes this movie and soundtrack perfect. It began with the Train Whistle which is so real that got my puppy searching all over the place for the train toy, Josh Groban's nice little piece of Believe which again plays into his talent fully, and some classic Christmas songs that I believe were digitally remastered / remixed.<br /><br />You can just sit next to the fire place in a sonwy winter night with a cup of hot coca / coffee / tea in your hands and listen in. Let me tell you this, that's heaven on earth, the peace.<br /><br />Music needs to be felt by heart, this soundtrack will touch your heart.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Many \\"unknowns\\" were answered in the movie Munich.  An eye opening drama.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|After you get used to Sarah Brightman's Christine, it's hard to accept any other version of Christine. <br />After you have fallen into sleep by Michael Crawford's phantom countless nights, there is, almost no another Phantom can take his place. <br /> <br />However, either you have been or not have been to the live stage show, you definitely will appreciate the authentication of this production. <br />Sir Andrew Lloyd Webb spared nothing to bring this to the silver screen and I am really glad it turns out well, even though it failed to fetch any win from Oscar. <br /> <br />It would be strange, very strange ( even a bit creepy ) to see Sarah Brightman or Michael Crawford to repraise their title roles in this movie, but the young and new comer did their roles justice and I successfully combined both beautiful voice of original production and image of new lavish production into my memory banks for this musical number.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|The concert was great and this certainly brought back wonderful memories..I love the acoustic versions of all of the songs-Everlong and My Hero are my favorites..The version of Best of You on this cd is fantastic-Dave doesn't hold back and it sound great!! A must buy...
B000GRTQSE|5.0|As a fan from the time of the \\"Bob Dylan\\" album, I have experienced all of the transitions Dylan has made in his long career. Some of them I liked more than others, but the changes were always intriguing and well-crafted. This latest recording is terrific, with echoes of the past, his sense of humor and his love of wordplay all in evidence. I've listened to this record many times since I bought it.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Ben Harper was only a name to me as he is to most people until faily recently.  I saw him live and on the Henry Rollins show both this year and and picked-up his new double album and am now scampering to get ALL his material and soak it up.  Bottom Line:  Ben is out of era...in the Motown years he would have had a home but today no one (including his label) really knows how to market him. He is far too mature musically for the modern day R&B radio and out of the mold for alternative music so he fits into that void that many have had GREAT success in such as Jack Johnson, Tracy Chapman and others but he is his own (as are the aforementioned).  He is old school R&B and his openess to experiementation and variation not too mention his talent and sound sometimes make me think he is the incarnate of the late, great Marvin Gaye, funny since I do not believe in reincarnation.  I can ealisy reccommend ANYTHING by Ben if you love Marvin and Motown.  He also has hints of Marleyesque struggle in his musical lyrics as well as a heavy gospel influence at times.  What an amazing talent! This album is one of his best overall and a good showcase of his music.  A good place to start but you can't go wrong with anything he has done.     *side note regarding review below that is overall positive (not trying to dis the reviewer, but if you want to play critic get it right).  IN the second paragraph this person claims that in \\"Picture of Jesus\\" Ben rips-offs Paul Simon's  \\"Diamonds on the Sole of her Shoes\\" (Graceland is a favorite of mine by the way) so I had to take a listen myself to see if there is any truth to this.  The only reason I address this is b/c he or she accusses Ben of being 'classless' for not giving Paul credit!  While the review was pretty good compared to most this was one of the funniest things I have ever read from a layman's review...first of all the only similarity between the two songs is that they both use a South African (Soweto) group to harmonize in the song, that is it!  Ben's melody and musical song structure is completely different and rather Paul had any influence on Ben is highly questionable (and even if he/she is right does it matter, music is all about influence).  Soweto has been around forever, long before the great Paul Simon brought it into the mainstream not to mention Grammy fame...so to say that it is classless to not thank Paul Simon (a WHITE amerikan songwriter) for Ben's (a Black amerikan) use of Soweto harmony in one of his songs is both hilarious and completely irrelevant.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|A good movie in seeing and understand the industrial development in England/Scotland during the 1800's.  Gives insight to effects on people.  Starts and moves a bit slow and is predictable, but I'm a guy.  My daughter absolutely loved the movie.
0735201684|5.0|Joseph Murphy seems to be able to explain everything so logically - why people get sick, why people with seemingly unrecoverable conditions recover, why miracles occur, why some people prosper and why some don't. Most significantly, he suggests, with convincing evidence, that each person has the power to create what they want in their lives. I found this book to be so simple yet so profound, and highly recommend it to anyone who has sifted through so many 'self-help' books to find one that gives them all the answers. Joseph Murphy essentially says - the answers are within you, the solutions lie in your subconscious.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|The above title for my review reflects my feelings about Diana Krall's enjoyable talent. F.S. is my long, long, time favorite.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This cd is great.  \\"Pain\\" is my favorite song ever.  I have one other three days grace cd, and I think this cd is right on par with that one.
0316286850|5.0|Making Faces by Kevyn Aucoin has been a valuable tool to me in my drama classroom. While teaching my students the proper way to apply stage makeup, I have used this book as a reference many times. Making Faces has been especially valuable when teaching my students how to use makeup for corrective purposes, and how to make them look like a celebrity. My students enjoy the pictures of the actresses made up to look like other iconic actresses. They were able to use the pictures as a guide for their own make up plots. Aucoin not only uses many colorful pictures to show the proper techniques and transformations, he also uses step-by-step instructions on how to create the look. Not only did I enjoy the pictures and instructions, but I also enjoyed reading the excerpts about his childhood and career in the makeup industry. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in makeup as an art form, theatrical makeup, and/or for someone who is interested in improving his/her appearance and technique.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|When I first watched the video for \\"I write sins, not tragedies\\", I thought it was funny.  I also love the song \\"The only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage\\". But the rest of the cd sounds a little too \\"night at the circus\\" for me.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd is way more than &#34;Freebird&#34; and &#34;Sweet Home Alabama&#34;! This is their first official studio album that was under a major label. This is an all-time classic and has 5 all-time great songs: &#34;I Ain't The One&#34;, &#34;Tuesday's Gone&#34;, &#34;3 Steps&#34;, &#34;Simple Man&#34; and one of the most in popular rock history &#34;Freebird&#34;. &#34;Things Goin' On&#34; is another underrated lesser known song and &#34;Poison Whiskey&#34; is also a very solid lesser known song. &#34;Mississippi Kid&#34; is the other song on the album and is a decent song but the least of the bunch.
1881273156|5.0|This book is great for couples and singles.  It helped my husband and I understand each other better and helped me heal from a previous divorce by understanding what went wrong.  I read the sections of the book that pertain to me over and over.  I find it helpful to remember which love language my husband has.  We both have the same main language but different secondary languages.  I am looking forward to getting another book: Children's love languages.
B000001ESF|5.0|The &#34;2112&#34; epic song which is really a group of songs is an all-time great masterpiece: Overture, Temples of Syrinx and Presentation are the best parts of this 20:33 song (Should have made it 21:12). The song &#34;A Passage to Bangkok&#34; is another song on this album that has been a popular live and is the best song after the best parts of 2112 that I mentioned.
B000FIMG68|4.0|I thought that the second season was almost as good as the first season.  I was not happy when they killed off the people that they did in this season, it's like they were doing it just to reduce the cast size and not to move the story along.  The one thing that I can not comment on is the extras DVD, since that was scratched so badly upon delivery that I could not get the DVD player to play it. Kinda of upset about that, really looking forward to all of the extra flashbacks and how JJ feels about this season compaired to the first.  To this day I still wonder if Michael and Walt ever made it to dry land. Would have given it 5 stars if I was able to watch extras DVD.
0823003590|5.0|By insisting that a likeness is obtained by concentrating on the shadow shapes and avoiding line, Maughan makes it clear how to make a magical three-dimensional image rather than the typical ideogram obtained with line.  It's the difference between drawing two lines down the side of the nose, signifying \\"nose\\" and two dark circles signifying \\"nostrils\\", and drawing the cast shadow of the nose, its form shadow as it turns into the dark, and adding a high light to have the visual sysem of the viewer construct a nose for itself.<br /><br /> He's clear about the materials (a white and a sanguine Stabilo pastel pencil)--even how to sharpen the pastel pencils -- and suggests a simplified 4-value structure.  He points out how important the light is on a head.  He can be forgiven the repetition, a section on drawing monsters by combining animal and human heads, and a section on color that should have been left out.
B000GPIPVU|4.0|Ray Lamontagne's new album contains more instrumentation than his first.  Although I wasn't sure at first whether I liked it as much as Trouble which I loved from the very first time I heard it, this one gets better the more you listen to it. Track 11 is one of his best ever and one of the nicest songs I've ever heard.
1881273156|5.0|This book clearly, easily teaches the 5 different ways we each relate to one another.  It is applies very well to couples; however, the principles also provide essential insight into relating with children, colleagues... anyone!  It makes an excellent group book study or a read-on-one's own.
B000JHS20E|3.0|This is very cute, and matches our son's room. I was excited to see the new Rainforest Line. However, this mobile is not very loud at all. The music is ok, but the rainforest sounds are very quiet. I'm sure that the baby can still hear it, but it seems so quiet. I am returning this and getting the Nature Sensations Mobile instead. I had high hopes for this and was disappointed.     EDIT: It is lound enough in a quiet room - the speaker points down to the baby so that he can hear it fine. Also, some other reviews says it turns on randomly in the middle of the night. Well, we figured out it was the baby hitting a button on the light portion and turning it on that way. When our baby did that, it was a good thing because he was squirming anyway - but if your baby did it in his sleep and it woke him up, that would be bad. I would change my rating to a 4 now after we've used this a while.
0307237699|4.0|I chose this title, \\"A credit to his race.....the human race,\\" because it is what Jimmy Cannon, the legendary sports writer said about Joe Louis, perhaps America's greatest boxer of the 20th century. I found reading this book to be a breadth of fresh air. The man is passionate, interesting, speaks to the heart, and is effective. As politicians go, it's a pleasure to see Obama has a future because he certainly has a NOW. I come from the other side of the political divide from the Senator, and that's why I find a man like this refreshing.<br /><br />I am not an ideologue, and find such people terribly boring. When they appear in the room, I leave the room regardless of what side of the aisle they come from. Obama is different than the normal breed of politician out there. There use to be a time when a life in government was a way of giving back to the country part of what the country allowed you to create for yourself.<br /><br />You never went in government to make a buck, but it's become obvious that for many politicians, government is a way for them to earn their fortunes, and it's off the people's back. There was a time when corruption was in the back rooms, and out of the way. The people always knew it was there, but it was not in your face. My, how things have changed.<br /><br />When you read this book, you find the thoughts of a reflective American based on his own life experiences. It is predicated on the belief that there are some things that GOVERNMENT CAN DO EFFECTIVELY, AND WELL, and this Senator would like to do just that.<br /><br />This is a man who just might be President of the United States some day. I don't know about 2008, because by then Obama may not have had enough time to become seasoned, to have been around the block long enough to have a natural grasp of the issues by simply being there.<br /><br />If you have ever been in the thick of a Presidential campaign, and you were to hitch a ride with the candidate on his plane, there is something that becomes very clear, very quickly. It's a question as to whether the candidate is competent or not. There are maybe 500 political opinion makers in this country who count. They are the writers, the television personalities, the pundits, and the editors. These 500 men and women always pass judgment on whoever is running for President.<br /><br />If they smell incompetence, they bury you. An example is John Edwards in the last election cycle. I like Edwards, he had a lot of star quality, and that means a lot in the world of politics. He just didn't cut it on the competency issue, and the group of 500 burned him during the campaign.<br /><br />Obama needs time to become seasoned. I just hope it doesn't mean he will give up his spirit, that wonderful quality that is the driving force of someone who is going to make it big in politics. He also has a natural base that will stand by him. African Americans make up 25% of the Democratic vote in this country. It is natural to assume that Obama should get at least half his natural base, which gives him 12 to 13%. He's got to pick up at least 7 to 8% of the remaining Caucasian (politically correct, for the red necks from Georgia reading this, I'm talking about the white vote). This means Obama should have at least 20% in the very early primaries. With 6,7,8 candidates in the running initially including Hillary, it comes down to Mrs. Clinton better watch out.<br /><br />If this all sounds rather callous and crude, I am telling you what happens when you sit down in that room, and start talking POWER, because with the power goes the MONEY. My sense is Obama will make the run because we now live in an age where you just can't think 2 elections out. Obama may not be Mr. Right, but he certainly is Mr. Right Now.<br /><br />In 2012, he could be yesterday's noise. Look at Al Gore who may have won in 2000. You can't count a vote that close in Florida, and John Kerry who lost by 85,000 votes in Ohio.

B000FIMG68|5.0|I loved watching Lost - Season 2 and reviewing all the back stories and the \\"easter eggs\\" throughout the Season.   <br />I can't say enough about this dvd.  The producers have found a way to make watching a televison program seem and feel like you are watching a feature film.   <br />It is a great show and I hope it lasts for many years. <br />
0446528056|5.0|I feel this book could hit home for so many people. How many times have we loved someone, gone in different directions only to reconnect and realize life doesn't stand still.  This doesn't mean our feelings change.  As John matured he understood what life was about including the hurt.  What a beautiful expression of Love and Respect.   <br /> <br />Thank you Nicholas for once again restoring my Faith in Love.  You are an incredible writer with interesting twists and turns.  I have read everyone of your books and share them with all my friends.  I look forward to your next release. <br /> <br />Nadine Morrison
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I saw the Broadway musical about 5 years ago and after seeing the movie and purchasing the DVD, I think that everyone should see this movie over and over again.  Chris Columbus has done a wonderful job bringing this musical to film and keeping Jonathan Larson's ideals and thought-provoking view and dreams alive.  The actors are first rate!  They each have their own unique style and their voices are remarkable.   <br />I am happy to have the deleted scenes as a bonus in the DVD.  I wish that Chris had kept \\"Goodbye Love\\" in the film, but thank god we have a chance to see it. It is a scene that has to be seen by all!  <br />The documentary on the Disc 2 is something I am privleged to have watched and I'm so happy to now know how Jonathan Larson lived his life. <br />No day but today!! <br />

B0000X61VE|4.0|This was the very first workout tape I ever bought.  I was sixteen, and I really wanted to get in shape so that I could make my high school dance team.  I knew NOTHING about proper form, tempo, intensity--you know, all the things that are so important in a good workout.  But once I popped this tape into the VCR, I was hooked! I did the routine day after day; and at the end of the year, I got picked for the dance team!  I was definitely sore a lot, but I never experienced any injury.  (Ah, youth--it truly is wasted on the young.)    Flash forward fifteen years.  I was surfing Amazon a couple weeks ago, looking for a new routine to add to my home workout library, and I came across this old gem.  I grew instantly nostalgic, but after reading the negative reviews, I was VERY hesitant to purchase it.  I didn't recall it being such a bad workout, but then again, I didn't know anything back then.  Still, I thought, \\"What the hell?\\"  and decided to review it with new eyes (and a much less flexible, 30-something body).     What do I think of it now?  Well, it's true what they say about Cindy--her form is pretty bad throughout the workout!  It's a wonder that she didn't pinch a nerve flinging her head back so far during the warm-up, and I seriously don't know how her knees held up all those years doing lunges so poorly.  Beyond the bad form, she races through the exercises so quickly that it's almost like you're watching the video on fast forward!  I can see how a viewer (especially one who is an inexperienced exerciser) could injure him or herself by imitating Cindy.    That said, this DVD has some great exercises that you won't find anywhere else.  I love the unique lunges and the leg swings, and I also like the abdomnial work.  I feel powerful and sexy when I do this workout, and I love the fact that Cindy doesn't try to \\"encourage\\" the viewer by saying things like, \\"C'mon--you're almost there!\\"  In fact, she seems to struggle through the workout as much as I do, which isits own kind of encouragement.  I also really like the music she's chosen--it's both enjoyable to listen to and the right tempo to perform the reps in time to the music, if you like doing that sort of thing.     The trick with this workout is to keep your remote handy and pause often so that you can do the exercises with proper form at a slower tempo.  Even if you don't feel like hitting the pause button, you can still get a great workout by doing slightly fewer reps in the ammount of time alotted, focusing on form and working in a safe range of motion.  You'll still be sore the next day, just not hobbled.    In sum, I like this workout, but I would NOT recommend it for the novice exerciser.  The risk of injury is just too great if you don't know how to modify the exercises to workout safely.  In fact, I'm amazed that I never injured myself doing this workout as a teenager!  But if you understand proper form and you don't mind doing the exercises at a slower tempo than Cindy, you can really get a lot out of this DVD.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|If you are like me and waited til there was a boxset available, then this is perfect!!  I love the box, and the fact that they all came together.  To me, it was worth every penny!!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love the supernatuaral. It is such a smart television show that combines horror/comedy together superbly plus the boys are to die for.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|The second season of Veronica Mars is just as quirky, funny, clever, and shocking as the first season. It's one of my favorite and must-see series. You'd be glad you bought this DVD.
1565117700|5.0|For those who have never read Of Mice and Men AND for those who have - this is an exquisitely read version of Steinbeck's classic tale.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural is a great show!  It has something for everyone.  Horror, drama, great characters, interesting storylines.  From the very first episode, it draws you in and makes you care about the Winchester family and their quest.  The chemistry between Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles is so convincing.  Don't miss this great new show!
B000GFLE86|5.0|I commute (car) and my CD player is central in keeping me sane. So, a good judge of good music for me any way is how often I want to listen to an artist's work. Madeleine's \\"HalfPerfect World\\" has been a smash hit. For the past 8 weeks now I have listened about 4 times per week. I just do not get board hearing her excellent pitch, diction, facinating arrangements and fine writing/choice of blues/jazz tunes. Sam Yahel's piano accompanyment is artful and deserves a listen on his own right. I first was made aware of her work via a Radio Jazz program out of Cleveland,Ohio. While driving home up my country road at 8:30 pm her of Glenn Cambell's \\"Everybody's Talkin' came up and I was messmerized. I have also purchased her \\"Careless Love\\" CD and listen frequently to that as well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched Firefly when it first aired back in late 2002 nor did I have any interest in watching the movie Serenity when it came out Sept. 2005.  I actually hated seeing the trailer for the movie because it previewed on every movie during the summer.  I happened to catch an episode (Our Mrs. Reynolds) one morning on the Sci-Fi channel and fell in love with it.  I can't believe how good this show was and how I had been passing it up all along.  I actually watched Serenity first and then the series (I know, backwards and kind of spoiled everything but it didn't matter).   <br /> <br />The series has a great balance of comedy, drama, action, western, and sci-fi to it.  Everything just blends right in with each other.  Some episodes are better than others but overall the series is great.  Truly a masterpiece.
B00009XITQ|5.0|This is a delightful story and the actors are great in their rolls.  I think adults and teens will enjoy it.  The story moves along well, and does not get boring.  There is a lot of humor and a lot of feeling.
B000063UR2|1.0|I never received product as they never shipped it. Amazon sent me an email stating that they couldn't complete my order as it was \\"non-deliverable\\".. Not sure what that means if every other item I purchase is \\"deliverable\\".
B00005JNS0|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. It was entertaining and the characters are great. My son can't get enough of \\"Caws.\\"
0307277887|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time! And I read a lot of books!! I find the author Jeff Lindsay's writing style quite refreshing as he was able to make me truly like this serial killer who only kills bad people we all would love in some way see \\"get it\\". His introspective narrative places you right in the mind of Dexter feeling his emotions or shall I say lack of emotions. Although I would say this book is dark it is not without comedy. Each time Dexter selects another victim I find myself cringing at whats to come but yet looking forward to it as well!! Truly mind gripping!!! I could not put the book down and can't wait to start on the next book, Dearly Devoted Dexter which I hope is not the last. I'm also hooked on the T.V. series starring one of my favorite actors Michael C. Hall.
B000286RKW|4.0|Refleja excelentemente la realidad de una época en la cual debían adaptarse rápidadmente para sobrevivir. O juegas el juego o desapareces. No se pueda pactar. Muy recomendable. Suspenso, emoción, drama. Completa en su genero.
1881273156|5.0|This book really helped my wife and I in our relationship.  It's very insightful, and practical.  We liked is so much we gave copies to our parents who are struggling with their relationships.  Great book for anyone though, even if you are not really struggling, but just want to understand each other better.  The implications of this book are huge.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|This was a good movie.  I was a little disappointed in that the movie  really didn't elaborate about the actual Munich event itself though.  I was interested in the athletes, the terrorists involved, the authorities, and mainly what really happened that particular day at those ill-fated Olympics.  Instead, the picture focused on the revenge of the athletes.  Still, it was a good movie.  Good to see historical elements and people, like Golda Meier.
0679805273|5.0|A wonderful book for kids but I got it to give it to newcomers in sobriety. It simplifies the wonderful life that lies in store for them.
0894803123|3.0|I bought this book at the same time as buying my first ice cream maker.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews first. <br />Almost all of the recipes use uncooked eggs, which I would never serve to my children. <br />I did modify one of the sweet cream base recipes that didn't call for eggs to make a chocolate ice cream.  My daughters liked it ok, but I thought it was grainy. <br />I've since started trying lots of other recipes and may try creating custard recipes from Ben and Jerry's ingredients. <br />We did enjoy the history of Ben and Jerry's and the humourous anecdotes.
B00005MP58|5.0|I really like the story and this film brings you back to the last century and the ambiance of these times. Colin Firth is fantastic in this role!
B0002S947K|5.0|A voice this distinctive deserves great songs to show it off. This album has the sensual writing and careful production to take LaMontagne's voice from curiosity to career. Listen. It rattles like a windowpane in the wind- you're still warm inside, while the view before you is clear, dynamic, and engrossing.
B000FIMG68|5.0|It's nice having the entire season in one place! We've already shared it with several \\"Lost\\" fans.
032147404X|5.0|This book is FUN, and easy to read.  It is packed full of useful tips.   <br /> <br />One that I will share is that if you want \\"tack\\" sharp digital photos use a tripod and the self-timer.  This eliminates the finger ! <br /> <br />This book is good not only for the \\"point-and-shoot\\" digital cameras, but also digital SLR. <br /> <br />This book 'shows' photos of Nikon and Canon high end digital cameras. But, don't let this discourage you.  I have a small Kodak 5 MP and I have been able to take some tips and use it with this \\"point-and-shoot\\".
B00005JNS0|5.0|This was a fun animated movie about Lightning, a young rookie in the Piston Cup series.   But the fun part of the movie, Lightning is not a driver, he's a car. This movie is based in a world of living cars.  Follow the arrigant rookie that can \\"do it solo\\" to a person that really learns what the meaning of Team is.  Funny and Quirky, just the right amount.  About half way through, I remembered the movie Doc Hollywood.  The story is similar, but unique and entertaining. Things are usually funner when animated. A good one for the collection.
B000H305U0|5.0|this album is a good follow up to Justified. Justin is unquestionably one of the best male soloists of our time.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Who needs Rodger Waters??? this DVD is so good without him. David Gilmour is great, his guitar work is awesome, glad to see Richard Wright at the keyboards and Nick Mason really plays great. I only wish they would tour again but I guess I will just watch this DVD and enjoy some of the greatest music ever written. Wish they would have played some songs off Animals, but you cant always get what you want. Highly recommended for Floyd fans.....
1401907725|5.0|Wow, after seeing some pictues on some website, I thought this deck and Doreen Virtue's other decks were all ugly. Oh, was I so wrong. They just posted the cards that aren't really attractive looking. They actually really gorgeous. I so don't regret buying her decks. I bought them all so far and now I just need the Dolphin and the daily guidance oracle decks from her to complete my set. You won't regret buying her decks because I didn't!! ^^    Also, in comes in a lovely hardcover box that fits your cards and booklet perfectly!! You can bring them everywhere without having to be worry that your cards being damaged!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This CD is a masterpiece.  There is no denying it.  Want one and Want two are pieces of work that Rufus will have a hard time creating again.  You really do have to listen to both back to back - which may take about 3 hours since they are pretty long, but these are definitly works of art.  I encourage all to purchase and listen.  I've given both as a set as gifts.  It takes a while to warm up to because it's very different.  But Rufus displays his fragilness in these two works and backs them up with his strong artistic, soul searching, bold self at the same time.  Partake!
B0006MT314|5.0|this is a really great CD! The songs from this album are awesome! of course, there's the so cool one tree hill theme song \\"i don't want to be\\" by gavin degraw... and aside from it, you should try listening to \\"when the stars go blue\\" and the song from the wreckers!!! the song \\"mixtape\\" is totally a catch! i love this CD! dedicated to all tree hill fans out there! (try buying this with tyler hilton and oth cd vol. 2... it will totally rock ur music world!)
B000002HPV|5.0|This is the best Bjork CD ever made. I've been a fan since the begining and I have to say that this CD is a real mind trip, explores music artistry like I've never heard it (when it was released).  I've been so dissapointed ever since (through Medulla - what was that barking dog song about?).  I've bought this CD as a gift for many.  It's great. Joga is beautiful and Bachlorette is mind blowing.  My favorite lyrics from Immature (the only lyrics in the entire song): \\"How could I be so immature, to think he would replace the missing elements in me?  How exreamly lazy of me!\\"  That's awesome!  A must have in a true music junkie's collection!  And I could stare at that cover picture for hours thinking, \\"what is she on to come up with that?\\" lol
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuassion is one of my favorite movies. The pruduction values and the cast are superior. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The second season of LOST was just as captivating.  It followed the lives of the castaways with as much drama and thrill as the first season.  The producers added more characters from the other portion of the plane keeping the island more interesting and thus more mysterious.  This type of program is to be watched without commercials for the best effect.
B000268QB2|5.0|This cd is now one of my all time favorites.  Resembling a deeper, more philosophical Copeland lyricly and better utilizing the piano, Keane will blow your socks off.  \\"We might as well be strangers\\", \\"She says she had no time\\" and \\"Bedshaped\\" are heart rending works bound to be loved by anyone who loves good music.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|can you say tongue in cheek. fine cast that works well together. super dry humour and good sci-fi action/storyline. unfortunately i never heard about the series itself until it was over and done with. i now have the complete series which i highly recommend. hopefully either the series will come back or we will see another movie. i am happy either way.
0375707972|5.0|First of all, the book has very short chapters and is easy to read, which is important for my attentional needs.  More importantly, The Reader speaks to the very humanness of all of us, even those judged to have committed the most heinous of crimes.  Schlink demonstrates that any gesture of kindness toward another human being has great value, not only for the person we are directing our deeds toward, but for our own soul as well.
B000002HJA|5.0|This CD was the best album I bought in a long time and I am so glad I did.  Every song on this is great and in my book is a work of art!  I am actually listening to Phototropic from this very CD and will have it stuck in my head the rest of the day.  If you like guitar riffs and melodies that will be stuck in your very soul for days on end, this is the CD for you!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Bob Dylan will go down in the history books as one of America's most important musicians and poets.  This CD is a new page in the musical legacy, drawing heavily on the roots of rock and roll.  Though it's entitled \\"Modern Times\\" and peripherally mentions some modern issues, such as levees breaking and Alicia Keys, the title is one of irony, as the album is anything but modern.  The music on the album is distinctly old-school and influenced by traditional American music.  You can hear the blues and the country-western blending right in with the folk.  Add an edgy rock and you get classic Dylan.  Dylan combines great story-telling with timeless music.  This CD is as comfortable as an old shoe, as warm as a summer sunset.  You can almost see the musicians sitting on a porch in the Deep South somewhere, with smiles on their faces.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|OMG - This DVD is fantastic! Disc 1 is not quite as good as disc 2 but that does not detract from how oustanding this set is. Lots of extras - some better than others. The time spent re-mastering everything was time well spent. The effort that went into this tour is mind boggling. A lot of times I just put it on and play it as background music - it even works as a 'Pink Floyd Greatest Hits' soundtrack.  <br /> <br />Sometimes my tastes do not coincide with those of my friends (e.g. Les Claypool DVD) but everyone I have played this DVD for wants their own copy. <br /> <br />If you are a Pink Floyd fan - get it! You will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006J3WH|5.0|even as a die hard buffy fan , \\"once more, with feeling wasn't one of my favorite episodes, that is until i bought the soundtrack. <br />every song just comes alive , and makes you want to sing along. <br />i was pleasantly surprised at the vocal ability of sarah michelle gellar and james marsters, but unlike the buffy the vampire slayer soundtrack that has alot of familiar tunes, you won't hear these songs on the radio. <br />anyway,if you love the show, then you should enjoy this.
0618680004|5.0|The man is a genius who has a talent for explaining things in a very clear way. Apparently he has decided to come out of his ivory tower and actively campaign against the harm caused by religion. Religion has been with us for so long, many of the points he makes tend to go unnoticed in daily life.  <br /> <br />Glad to see it is so popular and being so well received.
B00008DDHZ|2.0|Not really up to my expectation and I'm not impressed, there was no historical background on the Bloody Sunday, mainaction in the movie were streetfightings, killings etc. Would not recommend.
080701429X|4.0|This is an interesting book to read and reflect on your life as well as the world we are creating for our descendants.  I do worry about what we are leaving for the generation(s?) to follow.
0767812166|5.0|Aliens,whether they be from outer space or from across the border are greated with animosity rather than an attempt to understand and accept what they might have to offer. Very timely movie for today... great Bridges flick.
B00005RDRO|4.0|I am sorry, but I have always loved this silly, broad comedy by the great comic playwright Neil Simon.  It is outlandish, over the top and shake-your-head funny.  With more stars than there were at MGM, the picture bounces happily between the cast of characters all of which were definetly type cast. <br />There's the wonderful David Niven and daffy but classy Maggie Smith as Dick and Dora Charles; Peter Sellers as the goofy Mr. Wong who can't say his pronouns correctly; James Coco doing a riff on Peirot and freaking out over no dinner; the marvelous duo of Elsa Manchester and her nurse (whom she wheels around in her chair)the ancient Estelle Winwood who has a bit of a flatulence problem and Eileen Brennan and Peter Falk as Bogie and Bacall.  Add to this eclectic mix Alec Guiness as the blind butler <br />and Nancy Walker as the deaf mute maid and you are really over the top. Truman Capote adds the final exlamation point to the proceedings as  Lionel Twain, our wierdo host for the weekend who's address is-you guessed it-22 Twain.  That says it all.  A very, very funny picture.
0780622553|5.0|The special effects are cool, the plot is interesting, similar to that of The Matrix. I would regret to think that the producers only wanted to entertain people. The plot could raise group discussions on whether or not we are a part of an experiment...
B00003CX97|5.0|THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI opened in 1957 to rave reviews and a big boxoffice-over $35 million.  It is arguably Lean's greatest-at least of his epics, and you can see his skill with camera, use of editing for more of a dramatic punch and flawed heroes that would soon evolve into trademarks of his work. <br />Alec Guiness deservedly won the Oscar for the role of the English officer in captivity who is so inflexible, so unbending that these traits lead to his doom.  It's definitely a performance of major proportions.  Lean got more out of Guinness than anybody else, and it shows. <br />William Holden, of whom I am a particular fan, is the nominal star lending that star power to another performance that looks so easy it was overlooked at Oscar time (remember Clark Gable in GWTW), but is so  <br />wonderfully nuanced you are not sure for the majority of the picture <br />who is the real heel and who is the bigger fool. <br />Add S. I. Hayakawa as the pedantic but vulnerable Japanese prison commander and you have another rather ambiguous, fully layered character. <br />He had to learn most of his lines by rote as his English was not very fluent.  This led to slowdowns in shooting, which Lean resented but certainly was not in the same league as the hideous weather conditions <br />which, on par for a Lean epic frequently shut down production. <br />A truly intelligent \\"big\\" picture that not only delivers on size and scope <br />but on intimate feelings and relationships in the middle of a vast historical upheaval, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is certainly one of the great films of all time. <br />
B00001W9G0|4.0|Barbra Streisand has always been controvertial. I admire how she has spotted some of the untouchable topics in American movies. Full of criticism and courage, the plot is well-thought and presented in a very smooth way. The thing I regret the most is that in many of Barbra's movies we are prevented from seeing a happy ending! Great movie, I enjoyed it a lot.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Excellent flick, one of Sean Penn's best movies, definatly tops Fast Times At Ridgemont High

0553470485|2.0|The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette.
B000ICM5MG|2.0|How many times can the same movie be re-released?  There is no justification for this other than to grab more money from fans' pockets (and of course to tie-in with the past-its-prime 6th Rocky flick coming out).  I bought the original Rocky DVD box set, because I am a fan of the series.  Then there was the second set that miraculously appeared with \\"improved video\\" or whatever.  Now, Rocky is rererereleased in a 2-disc version, and the second box set is being rererererererereleased.  WHEN WILL IT END?  When will one release of a movie be the final one?  I'm tired of the big \\"screw you\\" to fans.
0425152251|5.0|This is a great introduction to philosophy, wrapped in a novel. The novel itself is weak, and in my opinion a little bit creepy.  But it did help me keep reading. The great strength of this book, the thing that may make you want to share it with others, is the explanation of philosophy. It's understandable and very interesting, and more or less covers the entire history of the philosophy of Europe and North America. Reading this book, one can see how the big ideas emerged over time, in religion, science, art, government, culture, and so on.  It makes history seem lively and real, and old ideas seem relevant and important today. <br /> <br />Not everything in this book agrees with every other thing I've read about Western philosophy, but I appreciated the readability and the way it ties things together.  Some good companion readings might include Robinson's \\"Introducing Philosophy\\" and Paul Strathern's \\"90 Minutes\\" series (e.g., \\"Aristotle in 90 Minutes\\").  I do think I'll read this book again, and I've given several copies as gifts.  If you want one book to read as an introduction to Western thought, this would be a good choice.

B00000IREA|2.0|Many have seen this movie on TV many times. For a B-movie it is great fun and interesting to watch. No extras on the DVD. I wish they did add something from behind the scenes, etc.

B00005JN4H|5.0|This movie is such a hoot!  The plot has several levels of insanity and all of them are delightful, with the solution to the \\"crime\\" a subtle, \\"only in NYC\\" surprise.  The obligatory \\"chase\\" scene is hysterical. Queen Latifa and crew at their joyous best.

0399226907|5.0|My three year old grandsons, who are twins, just love this book. Everytime they come to visit, the first thing they look for is The Very Hungry Caterpillar board book. The boys sit and know every word in the book and sometimes read the story along with the The Very Hungry Caterpillar DVD. I had to order another copy of the book so each had their own to follow.  The story is easy to understand for their age and the illustrations are beautiful and very colorful.

B000EULJLU|2.0|This album in no way lives up to any of their previous albums. Not only are they recycling riffs from old songs, they are doing so in a totally monotinous way. There's nothing new and exciting for this veteran Tool fan here.This album simply bores me.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|This cd took some getting used to- not the \\"usual\\" John Mayer. \\"stop this train\\" (not sure if exact title of song) is my favorite. Chances are you won't be disappointed. Would have rated this 4 1/2 stars if I could've .\\"Any Given Thursday\\" cd is an awesome live cd-check it out.
0930289528|5.0|Wow!<br /><br />I admit that I had not heard of this masterpiece until the film came out, but it doesn't matter how one is introduced to a great work, so long as they get to meet it.  On the other hand, I was a bit too young when it was written I think to really appreciate what this story is.  I just wish more people understood that just because the comic book may be the chosen forum it doesn't mean that the story should be taken any less seriously.<br /><br />Having now seen the film and read the graphic novel, I'm not sure that one is better than the other.  They both tell the same powerful story.  Different forums, different conventions, but both excellent.  I don't think you can have one without the other.<br /><br />In any case, this is definitely worth reading!  Wow!
B00005OAIE|5.0|This was my second purchase of this cd. The first one became scratched-probably from overuse. Well worth the money- even the second time around. Be sure to get \\"Heavier Things\\"- even better if that's possible!

B000G74S82|5.0|Wilson made a generation of kids look at love lost/love gained/love period, the way they never had before. It really wasn't an \\"age of innocence\\" back in 1966, but it was less complicated than what it would be like in the following decades, having to reconcile issues like E.R.A. amendments, growing tolerance/promotion of homosexuality, H.I.V./AIDS, and, ahem, the preponderance of man-made global warming. SHEESH! Back then we (I was a teenager in 1966) only had love and a war to deal with, beyond getting our school grades up for mom and dad (most of us had both, in the same house back then).<br /><br />So, this work of art was literally outstanding in its field, and those of us who actually listened to it were challenged with our feelings, thoughts, and actions toward this thing that we called LOVE. It was an absolute shame that Capitol Records was spoiled by their cash cow producers (The Beatles and The Beach Boys) and only wanted more of the same stuff that paid their salaries, and yet couldn't see the \\"art\\" part even as it was smacking them in their corporate faces! This album, Pet Sounds, spawned a deeper penetration into mainstream pop music of artistically developed poetry and music. Now we were getting exposed to productions that challenged our senses: abstract forms like \\"MacArthur's Park\\", self-divulgences like \\"17\\" by Laura Nyro, and of course John Lennon's 2 great anthems \\"All You Need Is Love\\" & \\"Give Peace A Chance\\".<br /><br />....all thanks to this work of angst...I mean, ART, by Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys - \\"Pet Sounds\\". And this package is a fine tribute to its existence...with a Bonus DVD too!

B000BTC5LW|5.0|This performance is fantastic. It is by far the best Floyd DVD I have <br />seen to date, and the best performance.  Not only do you get the 1994 <br />concert remastered to DTS, but it is 16:9 format.  You get Pulse, <br />and you get the entire Dark side of the moon album live. <br /> <br />The lighting is awesome. Every time I see this DVD, I wish I had <br />been there.  Sometimes the lights are so bright it washes out the <br />stage, but what a show!! <br /> <br />My Live concert DVD Juke Box is growing full.  If of all the artists <br />I listen to, I could only have a single DVD and I was to be stranded <br />on a island with a home theatre system, THIS is the DVD I would pick. <br /> <br />In fact, because I have found all DVD's don't last forever and the <br />quality of the media is not all the same, I have purchased a \\"Backup copy\\"! <br />10 stars if I could,and I was not actually the biggest Floyd fan growing up....

B000002J6H|5.0|I 've listened to this album since I was a little kid. But, dont consider my bias- this album is brilliant... and really is a sequel to the original CSN album. Nash and Crosby are on it as well as a host of other prominient musicians of the era, including J Hendrix. For anyone who notices, this album relies on vocal harmony which could be out takes from CSN. It was a blueprint for the next 10-15  years of California/60's rock...and no one else did as well. Like the Beatles, CSN and CSNY were a loaded group- filled with such talent, all of them squeezing out what they had in the format of the day- the LP. EVERY song is a gem, memorable and haunting. SS is a superb player, musician, singer, composer, producer... wow. I still hear this album and chills form in my body. It is one of a kind.

B0001IN07Q|5.0|This is a dynamite duo: cd/dvd!!!  I first heard Michael Buble music in the Spring of 2005.  The first purchase was It's Time, which is mind-blowing good!!!  Come fly with me is awesome!  The music is out of this world, and in my opinion, he sounds better than the original singers in the remakes he sings.  WOW!!!  The DVD is great!  It shows his sense of humor, as well as his sensitive side.  And there is no denying that he is an absolutely talented and amazing singer!  The band is second to none as well!  My impression of his talent was cemented even further when I saw his Concert in Spokane, WA in July of 2006.  He never missed a beat and his voice was perfectly in tune.  I have shared my excitement about his music and how it has touched my life with all of my friends, and have converted many of them to also be faithful fans of Michael's music.  I now own almost all of his CD's and cannot wait to get the next one!

B000003BZ4|5.0|One of the best blues/rock CD I've ever heard and possibly my favorite Gov't Mule album. In my opinion Warren Haynes is the best blues/rock guitar player at the moment, with lots of jazz influences (listen to 'Trane'). Killer riffs, great melodies, fantastic improvisation. Everybody who like Cream, Hendrix, Clapton and the 60's/70's classic rock bands must listen to this album.

0743298020|2.0|I read so many good reviews of this book that I had to get it for the Halloween season. It begins with an interesting and mysterious premise but soon evolves into pages of story with little excitement. I am at the last 5o pages of the book and perhaps I will find out why everyone else found this book so good. An antique book seller and his daughter operate a dusty old shop with valuable books. The daughter is invited by one of the top authors of the day to write her biography although she has been a recluse and resists others attempts to find out the truth of her life. The common thread between the author and biographer is that they are both twins. I am married to an identical twin and I am baffled by the excessive concentration on this one topic. Wait for it to go on the discount table.
B0000X61UU|5.0|This dvd is great it can be as hard as you want it to be- do this 3 times a week and you will get the result you are looking for. It is very easy to follow and not boring
B000002MFE|5.0|I bought this cd again because I'd lost my first copy and my partner had not heard it despite loving his Cream and blues cds.  This quieter and more contemplative album is quite different from much of Clapton's other work but is a classic. <br /> <br />If you are not a Clapton fan don't be put off by his heavy Cream and blues sound.  This cd is very different and will be enjoyed by people who like singer-songwriters who back themselves on guitar and with a discrete band.    <br /> <br />The cd contains Clapton's moving hit 'Tears in heaven' about his son's death and while it would be extraordinary if any other track could reach those heights, most are worthy accompaniments, making it a great album overall. <br /> <br />The few Clapton fans who have not yet heard him 'unplugged' should have at least one listen of this cd to hear another facet of the great man.  Unusually for Clapton, just over a third of the tracks on this cd were (co)written by Clapton. <br /> <br />
0380715430|5.0|People who are interested in language, in language history and development, cannot ignore this book. It is scientific yet hilariously written, combining facts with Bill Bryson's personal style. Thus is created a most entertaining and informative book. Thanks to the absence of technical terms, this book is also entertaining for people who think they are not interested in how English got to be what it is. But read the book - you will find you suddenly are!

B000127LW2|3.0|I love it even though it is pre Jeri Ryan.
0143036742|4.0|Life should make some sense, but for a lot of people, it doesn't.  Fate blows so strongly that they are pinned down or sent flying across the world to land in situations that never get clarified.  Some people struggle to bring order into their lives or to act in rational ways, but others just go with the flow, living for the moment, never worried about `the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune'.  Nadia, daughter of Ukrainian refugees in England, tries to deal with a cynical, materialistic sister at the same time as her aged father, more than a little wacky, decides to marry a money-grubbing bombshell from the old country who needs a residence visa as well.  She's 48 years younger than he, but what the hell, true love will conquer all.  Ah, but is it true love ?  On one level, this excellent novel is the story of the huge mess the old man creates and how Nadia and her instrumental older sister manage to pry the two `lovers' apart.  Though comic elements do run through the book, A SHORT HISTORY OF TRACTORS IN UKRAINIAN is not really about humor.  It's about family relationships---how people in a single family can be utterly different and utterly self-serving and yet certain events may still bring them together.  It's about the downside of immigration too.  People leave their old countries but bring so much baggage with them to the new one.  While finding a new and better life may be the primary motive for leaving, often immigrants suffer loss of values, plunging headlong into the consumerist whirlpool with nothing to hold onto, not having a clue how to manage.  Lewycka writes specifically about immigrants from the former Soviet Union, coming from decades of unbroken suffering of wars, famines, persecution, oppression, and injustice, entering the more fortunate, orderly and affluent societies of the West---where life for them remains chaotic because of their not knowing the rules, being prey to members of their own community, afraid or unable to ask, proud of living in an \\"orderly society\\" but personally out of order.  Even though the already-deceased mother had tried valiantly to reproduce European peasant life (though she was an educated person) in England, things fell apart as soon as she died.  Running throughout the book, like a bass chord, is the actual history of tractors in Ukraine, written by the old man whose life has been utter chaos.  Tractors serve as symbols of order and progress, just as he writes the book to try to bring order into his own life.  Tractors cut lines in fields, tame nature for good purposes----logic and science in opposition to the jumble recent history made in the lives of Ukrainians.  In the previous lives of the Mayevskyj family nothing made sense; they faced war, prison, torture, exile, and forced labor, with no control over their own lives.  The younger daughter, Nadia, growing up in England, has a life more tractor-like, but longs to know what came before, senses the old tragedies lurking.  The older one, with dark memories of the past, tries to repress the past, never think of it.  The appearance of Valentina, the lady with green satin bras and fluffy slippers, acts as a catalyst in Nadia's voyage of self-discovery.<br /><br />In addition to the different levels of meaning found in the novel, there are some great characters, especially Valentina, the blonde bombshell from Ukraine, and the old father.  I felt strongly all the way through that the author definitely knew what she wrote about.  She is able to bring that knowledge to life in a way that will stay with you a long time.ving in an \\"orderly society\\" but personally out of order.

1579125549|5.0|Patterns are the Brick of Chess - you must instantly be able to recognize these mating patterns automatically to succeed tactically in chess. <br /> <br />Practice, Practice, Practice. This book POUNDS into you the mating patterns you need to know in a way that is actually palatable to most. At times it may seem tiring, but if you were to complete this book you'd be much the better player tactically if for no other reason than you'd be more aware of the vast number of maitng and tactical patterns that exist in chess, exist in your games to be played, and will find existed in your games of the past. <br /> <br />As a tactical resource, this is one of the best chess pattern practice books out there, bar none. <br /> <br />
0739340131|5.0|I believe it, all of it. Somehow I fell asleep and missed all the events described in this book. That is how real this feels. <br />Max Brooks (in this book) doesn't write about horror and blood and guts, this is a history book. People relate how they experienced wartime. There are precious little actual zombies about, even the word itself is seldom used, since it is deemed inaccurate. <br />Like any good history book it has clearly divided thematic chapters like \\"Warnings\\" and \\"Blame\\". The conclusion is very satisfactorily executed with an outlook into the future. <br />The different, international what-if-situations are very believeably and intelligently spun out from the political and cultural situation today. <br />If some of the so called journalists nowadays would employ half as much drive for serious fact finding and well balanced representation that this quasi history does, reading the papers or watching the news would be a joy instead of a chore. <br /> <br />Audio book format: <br />5 CDs, each with about 17 tracks, each essay consisting of several tracks makes for hasslefree listening. There are no audio FX, except for an appropiately creepy sounding \\"jingle\\" in between chapters. <br />The voices are well known: Juergen Prochnow, Mark Hamill and John Turturro to name but a few. The accents are a joy to listen to. <br />Kudos especially to Mark Hamill who plays a US-Marine very well and with gusto. <br /> <br />The only qualm I have with this is that it leaves me ravenous for more. I want to know how the Palestine/Israel question was solved. What happened to all those who hoped to escape to the North, because the living dead would freeze only to face starvation and freezing themselves? How did those countries fare that didn't subscribe to the solution proposed at the Honolulu Conference? <br /> <br />Maybe Mr Brooks can be compelled to write more. I sure hope he does.
B00005YXZH|4.0|This record feels like a quietly spoken, frank, unexpected comment from a friend.  Wilco really has a unique sound, and an individual way of experimenting with different tonal palettes.  At the end of the day, this batch of songs also has enough going on on the melodic surface to leave you whistling a little piece of a song when you're torn away from your listening foray by the world.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|Three Days Grace's last album was your typical teenage raging at parents kind of thing.  Don't get me wrong, that can be a lot of fun too, but I really love the way they have grown and matured their sound.  I like just about all the songs on the album.   2 songs don't exactly move me but 10 out of 12, rating over 80% keeps it in my top 5 cd's I love to listen to. I really think if you've heard their first release from this  (and you liked it)  you'll enjoy the album.

B00003CY6M|5.0|Wow! Kate is so hot in this film that I was able to look past Cusack's toupee. How does someone get that cute? WaWaWeeWa! I could see myself really hitting it off with Kate. We'd make a great couple. Now I know that might sound immodest, but if you don;t have confidence I can tell you that you'll never get with Kate, so can that attitude immediately.<br /><br />I'm not going to comment on how some of the other reviewers criticized the odds of everything falling into place so perfectly. Because when fate is involved anything can happen. Also, it's OK not to be realistic when your need dramatic tension. Dustin Hoffman said so on The Actor's Studio.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|I did not have any of the original trilogy on DVD.  I am happy to have the theatrical releases as I am not a fan of the SE's, particularly Jedi.  I was nervous due to bad reviews, but they look and sound great.  If you like Star Wars and want the original releases I highly recommend these.  If you already happily own the SE's or are feeling cheated or robbed in some way by repeated releases of the same movie, then don't buy these.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|A good collection of tunes with a thematic motif running through it centering on premature death and loss. <br /> <br />The songs are typically sad, and there is a certain resignation in the attitude of the band; however there is heroism in the quality of love offered as well. <br /> <br />The best example is \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark,\\" a masterful song that avoids every cliche and bravely goes where few love songs would dare.  This tune alone is worth the price of the CD and there are other good songs as well. <br /> <br />Do not dismiss \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\": although bleak because of the circumstances of typical human existence, it is also profoundly moral and humanistic.  It shows why love makes life, what there is of it, worth living. <br /> <br />Recommended.

1594200823|5.0|A fantastic and fascinating account of the sorry state of the US food industry.  Michael Pollan has written a compelling expose of the perverse infrastructure upon which our breakfast, lunch and dinners are built.  Flavored with biting wit and flair, Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma is a must read for anybody who cares about what we put into our bodies and the far reaching implications (wars for oil) of the United States' industrialization of chow.  Highly recommended!

B00028HBKM|4.0|Excellent portrayal of the story Christ. I think that everyone should watch this once, although it is not something I would sit down and watch often. It is very graphic, but the death and torture of Christ was very barbaric. The reason that I gave this movie 4 out of 5 and not 5 stars was the fact that the story focuses a lot of the physical abuse and persecution of Christ, but this was not all that was going on. There was a HUGE spiritual battle that was going on as well. Christ underwent more than just the physical pain of being hung on the cross, but deal with bearing the sins of us all, which was more painful than the physical that was going on. I think that it is important to keep this in mind when watching the film.  Overall this film has had much controversy, it seems as if it has \\"offended\\" some Jews, making them seem cruel. Those who feel offended have taken this out of context. It was the Jews who sacrificed Christ who were brutal. Not all Jews are this way, nor does the film imply that all Jews are this way, thus, do not take offense when watching this film if you are Jewish.    -Christian Fobian, Author of Why Christ?
068987474X|5.0|This book was sooooo great!!! I read the entire book in one sitting and it was so true. I was going through some things with the guy I was with and this book told me exactly why he was acting the way he was.  It was so good that I even sent a copy to my friend in Chicago that was having problems and she ended up breaking up with her man because it opened her eyes to what was going on.  Since reading this book I am a very big fan of Greg's and never miss his show.
B00065MDRW|5.0|King Crimson's debut album, which would go on to become one of the most highly influential prog albums of all times, gets a loving remastering from Discipline Global Mobile.  Now in HDCD, the listener hears every subtlety of sound and expression.  '21st Century Schizoid Man' would go on to live a long life in concert, having been performed by every iteration of King Crimson up to the current day.  Now you can hear the original track in all its prog rock glory.  Greg Lake was the perfect voice for the founding fathers of Crimso, as proven by 'I Talk to the Wind'.  Backed by Micheal Giles (who also does drums), they harmonize in a quiet and mesmerizing way.  Ian McDonald's flute work is influential in itself, influencing of all people, Peter Gabriel in his early Genesis days.  The mellotron opening of 'Epitath' is brilliant, giving the listener a taste of things to come.  I simply can't say enough how good Greg Lake's vocals sound, he had to be the vocalist on the first KC album, the choice was obvious but the outcome fantastic. 'Moonchild' continues with the subdued glory of this first Crimso release.  A gentle, wimsical tune 'lonely Moonchild, dreaming in the shadows of the willow', no bass is heard and just the lightest touch on the drums and cymbals to add texture, the flute and guitar adding enough feeling to this beautiful track.  The closer is the monumental title track 'The Court of the Crimson King', which Peter Sinfield masterfully penned the lyrics for.  Few songs in prog rock history are as evocative as this one, the surreal imagery and music are classic and done to a perfection few artists seldom achieve.    If you've never heard King Crimson, this is a very fine place to begin.  Here you will begin a journey down a very twisty road, here you will see why King Crimson had such a profound impact on music and have lasted to this day (headed by Robert Fripp, the last founding member).  Get this album and prepare to be amazed.  5 stars.

B000GFLKEY|5.0|If you like action, shooting, explosions, fire, pain, torture and revenge, this is a movie you'll love.  And, it stars one of the best actors in the world who is completely believeable in this role.  A great storyline with intriguing twists plus situations and settings that are very close to reality.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|This is a genre we love here.  I prefer the pageantry and lavish sets of the aristocracy era flicks but daughter prefers the soot and smoke of this down to earth tale.  This one walks you smack into the early industrial revolution from a gentle, settled country parsonage life among the middle class of that era.  Noisy, smoky, full of the images of stark poverty and despair and yet tipped rightside up by those who fought their way through it and found success.  The theme of girl mistakes good guy for bad is all too familiar in this genre yet it is far more painful for some reason in this setting for me and I think is carried on a bit too long.  It poses challenges I found difficult to rationalize even for the era.  My daughter however loved it and perhaps the younger generation can identify with this type of struggle more than the posh and pageantry. A very captivating tale all in all and will keep you interested.
0060776757|5.0|U2 by U2 is everything a fan would love.  I've been an avid fan for over 20 years, since July 13, 1985 (true fans will know what took place on that date). This book gives the insight I've always wanted about this wonderful group of musicians.  U2 by U2 gives the story behind every song from their viewpoint (unlike \\"U2, the Story Behind Every Song\\", a book which was not from the band's viewpoint). This book delves deep into the elements that formulated each song.  Whenever I listen to music, I always think of the mindset of the band and the way the song developed that led to its recording.  U2 by U2 answered every question I ever had about U2's work, and I enjoyed it immensely.  The band members revealed their human side in their extensive personal writings, and I fell more in love with them as a group having read this book.  The pictures in the book surpass any I have ever seen, including the pictures contained in Anton Corbjin's book, U2 & i. This book is a must have for every U2 fan.   <br />~Joanne

B000002UJQ|5.0|Jeez loise this is a great album.  I've heard the hype about how great this album was, and had to get it to see if it could possibly live up to it.  The answer is a resounding YAH.  The really beauty thing about it is that it's a great album, not just a good song with a buncha filler.  If you're downloading a song or 2 from ITunes, and skipping the rest of the album, you're missing out my friend.  get it.  Get it NOW.  I'll wait while you do....... ok.  did you get it?  If not, you're a fool.  OKComputer.  fantastic.  Radiohead.  Geniuses.  YAH!
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|If you loved the first album, you'll LOVE this new addition.  Each song on the CD leaves you wanting more, and once you have heard the entire album a couple times, you'll want even MORE!  I feel sorry for the people that don't know about the Sisterhood, but I'm quite happy to keep them to myself.
B000002UDD|5.0|How come this album gets as much crap as it does? This is a fast, aggressive album containing phenomenal guitar work by Dave Mustaine and co-shredder Jeff Young. Young is a highly underrated guitarist. The guy had to fill Chris Poland's shoes, and Marty Friedman replaced him. I think these two factors are why he often gets so overlooked by many Megadeth fans. Don't get me wrong, there is no denying the absolutely incredible guitar skills of both Chris Poland and Marty Friedman. Those two are total beasts, but Jeff Young is fabulous, too. It would've been interesting to see what Chris Poland would have on \\"So Far...So Good...So What,\\" but I can't even imagine a Megadeth without Young's playing on this album.      1. Into the Lungs of Hell: fantastic, heavy-as-hell instrumental containing brilliant guitar lines from both Mustaine and Young. Mustaine's solos rock so freaking much! Unfortunately, Young's tapping riffs are almost inaudible, but that doesn't lessen the greatness of this song. 10/10    2. Set the World Afire: one of Mustaine's earliest compositions, and what a composition it is! This song is a very good mix between fast and mid-paced Megadeth and contains blistering, technical guitar solos. On another note, Jeff Young's solo in this song is PHENOMENALLY good. He is SO underrated by Megadeth fans. 10/10    3. Anarchy in the U.K.: excellent, fun cover of the Sex Pistols classic; love the guitar playing as usual 10/10    4. Mary Jane: Mustaine is a true musical mastermind, and this song reinforces that statement. Outstanding guitar riffs fill this tune, including a very dark, evil twin guitar attack towards the end. This song isn't that fast tempo-wise, but it starts picking up speed towards the middle and gets VERY heavy during the last minute. 10/10    5. 502: a fast song containing signature, hyper-speed pentatonic guitar riffs from Mustaine, shredding guitar solos, and thunderous double-bass drumming; also, Jeff Young's tapping solo on this will leave youspeechless; how he plays that solo at THAT speed I will never understand. 10/10     6. In My Darkest Hour: the most popular song on this album by far and an incredible ballad in all respects. The guitar solos on this track are mind-blowing. 10/10    7. Liar: the lyrics on this are hilarious, but the music simply rocks. The guitar riff in the intro, as well as the one that comes in when Mustaine says \\"Make up your stories\\" is extremely cool. Jeff Young's guitar solo in this is outstanding also, containing some smokin' descending and ascending picked scales, blazing two-handed tapping, and whammy bar squeals. 10/10    8. Hook In Mouth: this tune just rocks! I love it. The guitar solo section is, as you would expect from Megadeth, fabulous; Jeff Young does a \\"Flight-of-the-Bumblebeeish\\" solo before Mustaine comes in with some rocking, wide-stretch finger-tapping. Another outstanding Megadeth track and an awesome way to close the album. 10/10     This album is awesome and VERY underrated. If you can get your hands on the original recording, do so. It is so much better than the 2004 remixed version. Not only does the remix take away a lot of the life and power that the original had, but it also completely lowers the volume on Jeff Young's guitar solos (\\"In My Darkest Hour,\\" for example) and even alters the way that the \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\" solos are played! A lot of the finger-tapping on the song is gone and replaced with pull-offs. Anyway, avoid the 2004 remix and buy the original.
0975991477|5.0|As a RN MS, I read this book from a scientific point of view and found it to be the best book in describing in easy reading terms just how our thoughts create our reality, future, and basically our experiences.  It scientifically proves that we are the creators of our own reality.  Great book.
1419359827|4.0|Although the title does not quite do the book justice, this book more relevant for today's business world than any in the past five years. \\"Networking\\" has taken on a negative connotation in the recent past, but Ferrazzi shows how sincerity is the most important aspect of bringing people into your own network.
B000002UA9|5.0|This Cd stays in my car always! John's voice gives me chills just like he did in the 60's! I was lucky enough to see the Beatles sing in 1966 in Memphis, and it was amazing. My favorites are \\"No Reply\\" and \\"I'm a Loser\\".This CD shows pure raw talent that was created by these 4 geniuses! It always lifts my mood.
0671027387|3.0|As in his other books, Brown here shows he's a master of fast pacing and page-turning writing.  His people are generally believable and three-dimensional, and the plot is original (a massive deception involving what appears to be a fossil-bearing meteorite).  The reader will keep turning the pages and come away feeling entertained.<br /><br />For the reader with some subject knowledge, the enjoyment will be tempered.  Writing about technology which does not exist is within a fiction-writer's purview, but Brown adds a preface stating that his technology (which includes insect-size UAVs and large hypersonic jets) exists.  Aerospace and military technology is one topic I actually know something about, and Brown's statement is simply wrong.<br /><br />Finally, Brown indulges in the most annoying, and frankly insulting, convention of thrillers - that there are U.S. military units that will kill innocent American citizens, including government officials, on command without question.<br /><br />Brown is a heck of a writer, but he needs to raise his sights when it comes to making his work believable.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why, oh why was this series canceled?  I've lent this DVD set out several times and everyone asks the same question.  Another lost jewel.  At least we can go back a watch them over and over.
B000FIMG68|3.0|I get impatient with this show. It's like a TV soap in that it never seems to go anywhere, and is there a plot?  I haven't found it yet.  It's better than most of what's on TV, but when I invest so much time into watching a series, I want something to happen or, at least, to learn something.
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorites, along with \\"An Affair to Remember\\" and \\"The Notebook.\\"  Richard Gere is fantastic in this role and as you listen to the commentary on the making of the movie you realize how seriously he took the role.  He practiced many hours in order for things to look professional and that translates into superb dancing technique. Stanley Tucci is a hoot in this movie and he as well did a great job dancing. Jennifer Lopez was so interesting to watch and as her character evolved she too transformed in front of our eyes.  Susan Sarandon did an excellent job playing the wife of Richard Gere.   All in all this was entertaining from beginning to end.  The music was inspiring and the ballroom scenes with the quick step and the waltz were my favorites. If you enjoyed watching \\"Dancing With the Stars\\", you'll love this movie!
0451167716|5.0|Best book I have read this year (2006).  I am in grad school for a political science, and this was a requirement for a foreign policy course (read it, or re-read it to see why).  The relationship within the family, and with the other families is excellent.  With about five other books being read this one took only two weekends (20hrs of 'I can't put it down' reading).
0596009208|5.0|Head First Java, 2nd Edition is great for those just getting into java programming.  It's fun to read, for a text a book, and uses lots of illustrations that help the reader grasp java and OO programming in general.  I highly recommend this book.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|This album is really really really really really really really really out there and deff very good. Its deff the most progressive metal album ive ever heard (Tying round some of the stuff Dillinger Escape plan does) Now this music is a GROWER OK. I mean literall growth from \\"Wow this is the most overrated album I cant belive so many ppl rated it highly\\" to \\"Damn this album really is as good as they say\\" in one day. I found it really almost weird at first (Which is strange in itself cuz im deff into progressive music specially progressive metal) and then the album really sunk in and I got it! Deff a great album with some good songs. While I do have some favs off the album theres no real standout like \\"Oh thats easily teh best song on the album\\" its just filled with a consistantly mind bending, trippy, progressive, odd time signatured, guitar, bass and drum filled musical talented, always metal experience thats worth the buy even if you do feel that the album is overated. Which would be hard to find in my book.

B000001ELR|5.0|This was KISS' last studio album with makeup for quite some time.  Even though Ace Frehley is pictured on the album cover, he didn't contribute anything to the album.  The two lead guitarists on this album are Bob Kulick and Vincent Cusano (Vinnie Vincent).  They both did excellent work, and Vincent even wrote on the album.  The album only has nine tracks, but all of them ROCK!  Listen to all of them, and be prepared to be blown away.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|First I didn't pay any attention to this serie. It started here in Finland Autumn 2006. But I read some reviews before it was launched here, so I became curious.  <br />I thought that OK this is like hundreds of other similar scifi things. I am not interested any new X files. But when I got the box in my hands and watched the pilot, I had to admit that this is pretty damn good written. And the actors do their job brilliantly. Their chemistry between each other shows and push the story to the next level. <br />This serie combines different elements and styles cleverly together and it is not purely supernatural graphic design artwork. <br />I strongly recommend this if you like wellwritten and directed drama.
B000001ELD|5.0|Gene Simmons' first solo album is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!  It features 11 songs, and features guest artists, including (but not limited to), Joe Perry, Cher, and Bob Seger!  I noticed that every one of KISS' solo albums do at least one cover of another artist.  I can't remember Paul Stanley's cover, but I know Peter Criss covered \\"Tossin' And Turnin'\\" and Ace Frehley covered \\"New York Groove\\".  Gene Simmons steps it up by a lot!  He covers \\"See You In Your Dreams\\" by KISS!  He also covers a Walt Disney classic, \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\", since he widely credits Disney for being instrumental in helping him learn English (Gene was originally from Israel).  You truly won't be disappointed.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Back in 2001 when this came out, I basically missed this. I didn't catch much of the hype, don't really remember hearing the songs, didn't see any videos. You may ask \\"Were you in the civilized world at all?\\" Back then I was still discovering music and was a rabid Beatles fan, I couldn't be concerned with a modern band when it seemed like the entire musical landscape in my recent memory was rather... uh, bad. I hadn't got into The Strokes until early this year when I saw the video for \\"Juicebox\\" a few times and said \\"I might buy that CD.\\" I'd had good results from an impulse buy of the Foo Fighters, so I was feeling optimistic. So I got First Impressions Of Earth and worked my way back. <br /> <br />So I can say that whatever I think of this album is not influenced by any hype or fond, nostalgic memories of the time it came out. Track by track: <br /> <br />\\"Is This It\\" - Most people start off albums with jolts of energy (or they start with a quiet, throw-away track and then jump into track 2 at an insane markup in volume to get people to jump, I guess), but not The Strokes. \\"Is This It\\" is a lethargic, droning kind of song, but the good kind. A good drum sound and interesting bass part keep your attention, as well as Julian's tired vocals. The energy of this song is not in high speed or volume. It all blends together to make an oddly catchy, unexpected start for the album. <br /> <br />\\"The Modern Age\\" - Building up the energy some, we have a moderate paced song, very guitar driven. Julian's overdriven vocals are irresistable and he gives a very good performance here over another catchy melody. Nick and Albert's guitars blend together two unique parts to very good effect, but the volume of the drums and, moreso, the bass make them almost negligable to the song. <br /> <br />\\"Soma\\" - A good song, stepping up the pace just a little once again. This probably isn't one of the best songs on the album, but it doesn't hurt anyone being here and flows quite nicely in the album context anyway. It changes feel from bright to dark effortlessly, giving it some good dynamics. Nick's later guitar countermelodies are somewhat hinted at here briefly. <br /> <br />\\"Barely Legal\\" - Once again, the next song increases the pace just enough. Irresistably catchy, good guitar, nice beat - this song has everything you could ask for from a single song of this kind of rock. Plus, who doesn't love singing along with Julian when he says what his sister doesn't give? Go to a concert and listen to the audience! Even though he isn't exactly subtle in his expressions (\\"I just wanna mis-a-behave/I just wanna be your slave\\"), when he sings it it has so much more style than Chad Kroeger saying \\"I like the pants beneath your knees\\". <br /> <br />\\"Someday\\" - Nostalgia for the young people who only have high school to be nostalgic of. A driving beat and quick rhythm propels the song beneath Julian's (once again) catchy chorus, expressing wanting to break up as gracefully as pop/rock can allow: \\"You say you wanna stay by my side/Darling, your head's not right/Alone we stand, together we fall apart\\" <br /> <br />\\"Alone, Together\\" - One of the more subdued and melancholy tracks of the album, despite its simple, but effective guitar riff and changing dynamics from relatively tame to relatively bombastic. One of the few songs that I couldn't see working to such great effect as a single, but this is the kind of album track you buy an album for. <br /> <br />\\"Last Nite\\" - The song that it seems turned everyone onto The Strokes (I think I vaguely recall hearing it back when it came out. Earwax buildup, I suppose), and it's understandable why ears perked. This song has everything you could want to break into the public: a strong rhythm, an exceptional vocal, a catchy melody and instrumentation, and a healthy dose of rcokin'.  <br /> <br />\\"Hard To Explain\\" - Quite possibly the best song on the album, as others have said. From the very beginning drum sounds to the very end, this song oozes goodness. The riff that the verses are built around is very easily memorable and gives Julian yet another opportunity to show off his vocal cords, and, for probably the second time on the album, the bass does something truly interesting! The lyrics are somewhat vague, but still gives you an impression of what's going on and they seem to express a feeling all us teens-young adults have at some point and probably many. <br /> <br />\\"When It Started\\" - Hmm, this is odd. This song feels rather out of place after \\"Hard To Explain\\" and that makes plenty of sense since this is the one that was switched in in the place of \\"New York City Cops\\". It was intended as a B-side and I can see why. It's not that it's so bad, but it doesn't seem to fit. With its odd, fast rhythm it would have fit better on the first half of the album, but that already flowed to well to be broken up. And who knows what he's singing about or where the title came from? <br /> <br />\\"Trying Your Luck\\" - Another of those few kind of down songs that they do so well. One of my favorite tracks on the album. Another song with an odd and changing rhythm, and I keep pointing these out because many bands don't seem to have a concept of the effectiveness. They don't do it so sloppily (and godawful) as System Of A Down, this is more akin to the kind of changes The Beatles would sometimes employ. In fact, I would even say this could have been a Beatles song, like one of their early dark-toned ones such as \\"I'll Be Back\\". Did I just compare The Strokes' quality to The Beatles? <br /> <br />\\"Take It Or Leave It\\" - A good end to the album, and a very good performance on all fronts. Another catchy tune, but not quite like the other ones. This one is more raw. Need I note the dynamics of this one too? <br /> <br />One that should also be noted: <br />\\"New York City Cops\\" - There's a reason why everyone says to seek this song out if you buy the American version and don't have it. It is just that good and works much better than \\"When It Started\\" after \\"Hard To Explain\\", in large part because this is a song that's good enough to follow that tough act. Very punk inspired and Julian rises to the occasion on vocals once again, and everyone actually turns in a great performance. If you ain't got it, get it! <br /> <br />If you're looking to buy this album, what I would do is go for a foreign version that has the original album art and the bonus DVD with videos. I got mine used on Amazon for slightly less than I could have got the American version with DVD! I do like the American cover art and think it's really cool, but the back photo is better on the import (and the front ain't bad either) and the whole package looks better together. The front and back are black and white and so are the inside photos, but the American version has significantly more colorful covers. The DVD is also worth having if you ever want to watch the videos. The \\"Last Nite\\" video is actually a live performance on a sound stage and is thus a slightly different version than is on the album. Also the MTV 2 Dollar Bill outtakes are nice to have and make the DVD worthwhile for virtually no extra cost usually. <br /> <br />On a technical note, this is probably the album that is best mastered, not much evidence of the loudness war's effects here, but it still sounds lo-fi anyway because of how it was recorded. The drums don't sound very great generally and aren't very big. They needed to at least be brought up farther in the mix, and everything could have done with a tad bit of reverb probably. It all sounds very direct-injected, which is often just a little too bare for electric guitars. But I'm sure they intended it to sound this way, so who am I to say how it should be.  <br /> <br />And so with just enough dirtiness and a healthy amount of swearing and some much-needed substance in songwriting, The Strokes have made an album that I hope will be remembered in the future. I've never listened a lot tomany of the bands they are often said to be influneced by/ripped off, so I can't comment on that. They do sound kind of like Television on this album, but that's not really difficult since Television doesn't have a really difficult and produced sound from what little I've heard. In any case, I think this is a very good album, and definitely a great place to start a career (that is, if you can keep the quality up after the first two or three albums), and it seems chances are just about anyone who likes good rock music will. My dad's 56 and he digs The Strokes! <br /> <br />
B000001ELP|5.0|This is definitely for collectors.  The album's concept was amazing, but not a lot of people were ready for it.  KISS was expected to come back rockin' out!  Pink Floyd, The Who, The Rolling Stones, and Styx were among the only ones to do a concept album with good results.  I have both of Styx's concept albums, \\"Paradise Theater\\" and \\"Kilroy Was Here\\", both excellent.  Robert V. Conte again does a great job describing the history of the album.  If more of the album's story was released, it might've done better.  It would've been better if Ace Frehley contributed more than one song to the album.  He and Eric Carr both wanted to go back to regular Rock n' Roll, but Ace was outvoted by Paul and Gene.

B000002LJW|5.0|I bought this album in cassette form years ago.  At the time I really didn't know much about EC other than his association with the Beatles, his track on the Back to the Future soundtrack, and the intriguing guitar duel on George Harrison's Cloud 9 title track.    Having gone through most of his work since, surprisingly, this album remains my favorite.  In a nutshell, it was a great first impression.    Even though you can hear George playing and singing backup on \\"Run so Far\\" on this album, it came as a poignant surprise to find out that it was George's own song, and to hear his version of it on his final, posthumous album.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|This is really good that the original trilogy without all of the added features that I remember it back in 1977 when Star Wars came out, is finally in DVD format.  It took George Lucas and his crew to get it out on DVD.  But once it was out, I was surprised to see it on DVD and have looked at it several times.  I already have the 2004 version of all 3 movies when they came out on DVD 2 years ago.  There is one drawback though, that I wished that George Lucas had the original trilogy sold without the 2004 version.  It would have made it a better package for those of us who are really diehard Star Wars fans. <br /> <br />All in all, this is worth getting and having as a collector's item, along with the original VHS versions of 1977, 1980 and 1983...without the added scenes or extras that the 1997 and 2004 versions have.  This is the way I remember it back in 1977, 1980 and 1983 when they came out in the theaters. <br /> <br />
0452287588|5.0|I have just finished reading \\"Awakening\\" for the second time and found it just as inspiring as the first.  Each time I brought different experiences to it and felt I received just exactly what I needed at the time.  It covers many subjects and some such as those dealing with grievances and the \\"pain body\\" are extremely useful for dealing with many types of situations.  Tolle gives specific examples to make the topics come to life.  A book that gives and gives.
2070518426|5.0|I found this book to be a great way of keeping up with my french language, as I rarely ever use it but I want to be able to. The first chapter was difficult for me just because i haven't read in french for awhile, but the further into it I go, the easier it gets. It helps that i've read the english version, because it saves me having to look up the french vocabulary that I don't recognize. I think it's a good book for keeping up with your french, and the translation from english is excellent.
0345423496|3.0|I took 3001 on vacation because I wanted a fun, fast, mildly interesting read. It fit the bill wonderfully... it wasn't so complicated that I had to focus on it like a final exam, but it wasn't cotton candy either. That being said, you may be disappointed if you carry a lot of expectations about anything associated with the original 2001. \\"3001\\" is an engaging look at a possible future, but it most likely won't become a science fiction classic.<br />UPDATE: Because my earlier comments are misleading some readers, I'm adding this further explanation and adjusting the rating from four to three stars. The original review was only my way of highlighting the positive instead of the negative. That said, IF you like speculation about our world of 1,000 years from now, 3001 is a fun and easy read. Will its predictions conform to your own? Not unless you and Clarke are of very like minds. Does the riddle of the monolith aliens come to a glorious conclusion? No, I agree with many here who say that it's weak. Hard core fans of 2001 will probably not like \\"3001\\" and should only read it if they have a thing for completeness.

B000GIWS7E|5.0|Great DVD, awesome. Maybe less heavy than Budokan, but still powerful, breath-taking and even touching. Everybody's on top of his technical form, especially JLB. Must have for everyone. Dream on!!!
B000AA305M|5.0|I bought this album for one song, and I love them all, which is something that rarely happens.  \\"Hospital Food\\" and \\"The One I Love\\" are my favorites, but the rest of them will grow on you.  I'd never even heard of David Gray before, but intend to watch for more from him in the future.  Just wish it hadn't been one of those Sony CD's I'm afraid to put in my computer!
B000GG4KTU|4.0|It took me a while to warm up to Diana Krall but once I did I was hooked.  Her Live in Paris CD and DVD were awesome and I now own her entire collection.  As a big fan I expected to like this new work but I liked it even more than I anticipated.  Her previous work has all been in a combo setting with Piano, Bass, Drums and Guitar, on this disc she sings and plays with a full band, the Hamilton-Clayton Jazz Orchestra and the result is fabulous.  Her voice, phrasing and style come through in a new and very enjoyable way with the big band behind her. I hope she chooses to reprise this format soon.
0783227434|5.0|Great special effects while retaining the spoof and humor. A must have not only for Bruce Campbell, Evil Dead2 fans but anyone who loves a good spoofy horror movie.
B0009HKH6Q|4.0|This movie was good when it came out and it has only gotten better.  While the plot always seemed a bit of a stretch the remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo was even more so.  And the ending of the original is so much better in my view.  This 1968 gem is just short of a classic and has really stood the test of time.  I have a 2 part test for whether or not I want to buy the DVD of a movie versus just rent.  The first is that I want to watch the movie in its entirety more than once over time and second is that I want to cue up certain scenes from time to time.  This movie passes both tests.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I love the 1st season and I can't wait for the 2nd season!
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|There is no getting around the fact that this 1949 movie is great fun, and a pristine print is finally available on DVD from Warner Home Video. It should come as no surprise that the film is so faithful to Ayn Rand's eminently readable, marathon 1943 novel since Rand wrote the screenplay herself and in true individualistic fashion, demanded that not a word of it be changed during the filming. Consequently, every scene is full of dialogue with her cerebral polemics, sometimes heavy-handed but often sharply clever, much of it highlighting her philosophy of objectivism. She has the ideal partner-in-crime in director King Vidor, who brings his trademark melodramatic flourishes to a feverish pitch here. The result is often laughable for its excesses but irresistible for the Baroque style Vidor fluidly instills with every preposterous story turn.<br /><br />At the core of the time-spanning plot is Howard Roark, a supremely talented, uncompromising architect whose ego reigns supreme and whose selfishness ultimately marks him as a true success in his field. Interestingly, while Roark's designs bear a deliberate resemblance to Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie style, they more importantly retain a timeless, contemporary feel. His philosophical adversary is Ellsworth Toohey, an architectural critic for the New York Banner, a pompous elitist who values mediocrity as a means to subdue the masses. In between Roark and Toohey is the Banner's owner, tycoon Gail Wynand, whose successful climb out of his Hell's Kitchen background has given him unprecedented power to influence the masses. While he is Toohey's boss, Wynand gradually comes to admire Roark's talent and individualism.<br /><br />Complicating matters considerably is Dominique Francon, the headstrong daughter of a successful architect, whose primal attraction to Roark is mixed with self-loathing over what she envisions as his doomed visions. Roark's polar opposite can be found in his former classmate and rival architect Peter Keating, a man devoid of ideals and more than willing to accommodate the masses to ensure his livelihood. Their various interactions eventually lead to a melodramatic climax which has Roark secretly designing an expansive low-income housing project only to see it bastardized in construction. His fate hangs in the balance as he cannot reconcile the compromise made to his vision.<br /><br />While obviously too old in the early scenes, Gary Cooper is able to tap into Roark's darker side while dexterously maintaining his heroic standing. In quite a contrast to the amiable speech he gives in the climax of Frank Capra's \\"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\\", he delivers the particularly lengthy, verbose courtroom speech with conviction. In only her second film, a 22-year old Patricia Neal is certainly a sizzling, glamorous presence as Dominique, and she makes the most of her rather impossible role even though Vidor seems to be encouraging her to go overboard frequently. Nowhere is this more evident than the hilariously over-the-top first encounters between Roark and Dominique when she thinks he is a lowly, testosterone-charged quarry worker (with one big gyrating drill!)<br /><br />As Wynand, Raymond Massey is able to lend surprising humanism to a man who finds in Roark his one opportunity to take a heroic stand. Robert Douglas overdoes Toohey's effete manner, but he does become the villain you love to hate. The weak link in the cast is Kent Smith as the simpering Keating, melting way too easily in the background. Adding immeasurably to the film's Baroque dimensions are the crescendo-filled music of the legendary Max Steiner, the deep shadows pervasive in Robert Burks' masterful cinematography, and the almost expressionistic sets by Edward Carrere and William L. Kuehl (note how ludicrously huge Wynand's office is). With no accompanying commentary track, the 2006 DVD contains just two extras - the original theatrical trailer and a strictly by-the-numbers short, just eighteen minutes, onthe making of the film.
0143036556|5.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel was a great book, but I really found a few of his arguements, especially with respect to why China stopped her age of exploration, to be grasping at straws.   In this book, however, he is right on the money.  Assuming his data is correct, which I have no reason to assume it is not, his conclusions are impeccable.   This is a very important book, and an exiting read.
1594481938|2.0|This is a very strange book.  I read it for a book club we and all agreed it's very strange and depressing.  The story line was easy to follow, just an odd subject.  I don't want to mention too many details to ruin the book in case you want to read it; I was thankful though that it didn't have a fairy tale ending.
B000000WJ2|5.0|IMO this is a more seasoned album by Keith and the Winos than the first one. One of the best solo tunes ever by a Stone is on here \\"Hate it when you leave\\".
B000FP2OPY|5.0|For any Supernatural, Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and Jeffrey Morgan out there - this is awesome! I loved the bonus features with the gag reels and special link to the interative site. Awesome dvd!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer has a talent for songwriting and mixing music genres: his childhood love for blues, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and growing up with pop icons like Sting and The Police. His latest album Continuum, is unlike his first two albums (Room for Squares and Inside Wants Out). You can hear his growth from being a sole acoustic guitar player to being plugged in and rockin on. Mayer has always played guitar with emotion and not rehearsed licks. He has a way of creating vivid imagery meanwhile creating a musical forum to tell his story. Only John Mayer can bring back the blues with a pop star following. Continuum covers political issues, matters of the heart, and pays tribute to artists that have paved the road making the blues mainstream.  <br />Continuum is an album that will have atleast 3 definite songs that catch your attention the first time you hear them, and then the rest of the album will grow on you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was the best tv series that I have watched ever. It was like reading a good book. The worst thing is it doesn't have a second season.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I'd buy this CD just to look at the cover. More important, listening to the soundtrack brings back the memory of watching the movie over and over again. The music is addictive and rewarding.
B00000J048|4.0|it took me some time to introduce this to my 2 yr old son and get him interested. but once he got the hang of it ..both father and son would spend hours on this..and hacing fun at the same time. <br /> <br />he's understood the fundamentals and now uses his own imagination and combination to play with this toy. <br /> <br />I see this as a long time to-companion for my son and hope to get versions for bigger kids as and when he starts growing up. <br /> <br />it was worth the time and effort that I spent alone on the toy in order to show my son how it works !
B000FIMG68|5.0|We got adicted to this show when living in the US.  Now we have moved to Austria and were delighted to find it as a package set.  Love the show, thoughtful, dynamic and excellent character developement.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00005JPAD|4.0|This is a complex film - It explores the Irish Mafia in Boston and the Irish in the Police. The good guy is Billy Costigan played by Leonardo di Caprio. Here he is driven almost insane by his role as an undercover cop - mental survival is his big challenge. The baddie is Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon - He goes from success to success in the Police supplying his mentor/godfather and with inside information. The godfather in this case is Frank Costello - played by Jack Nicholson, perhaps over-played is a better description of his swagger and insanity.<br /><br />Damon is only mediocre in the role, di Caprio is great but the great player for me is Mark Whalberg as Seargent Dignam he is such a star in his minor supporting role. Whalberg is a highlight.<br /><br />Another great highlight is the very creative and inspiring sound track especially with Van Morisson singing the great Pink Floyd classic Comfortably Numb - Amazing.
B0000025DD|5.0|Superbe Pink Floyd Sound. <br /> <br />Best Solo Album from David Gilmour. <br />You must own this Cd.
031286504X|5.0|The title story is amazing - shocking how contemporary his writing is considerign our view of the 50s and the horror is both types: action-packed and psychological. But the real gem is in the bonus short stories: \\"PREY\\". Anyone who has seen the movie \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" with Karen Black will never forget the terrifying Zuni Devil Doll! This is THAT short story - it and the other bonus ones are phenomenal.

B000FIMG68|5.0|Another excellent season from J.J.Abrams who was the producer of mystic espionage series called \\"Alias\\". I will be waiting for third season of LOST with big enthusiasm.And do not hesitate to have it if you want to be parted in one of best show on TV recently....

B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is the most fabulous album I heard since decades. Thank you Bob for enlighten our lives.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The Complete Second Season of LOST 2 is an awesome experience with all the features just adds a bit more to the fun,  <br /> <br />Although the delivery schedule is quite erratic, I guess at Amazon you could do it withut this minor blip.
B00004YA66|5.0|Things change often in Frequency and everything that happens is important -- from the first scene, until the closing credits. This is a very entertaining  movie, with well developed main characters and convincing acting.  The plot is totally impossible, but after the first few scenes, it no longer matters.  Sit back, suspend your scientific logic and simply enjoy this movie.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|The effects are fantastic!!! My kids and I loved watching it! Only the movie came after a lot of delay. <br /> <br />Abubakar Salisu
B000G759LW|3.0|While Christina might have the voice, she needs to \\"strip\\" herself of the brands she makes herself.  The first album, blonde airhead w/a voice, second album--dirrty songstress, and this album--roaring '20s chanteuse.  She just needs to be....herself...and focus on the artistry and making ORIGINAL-sounding music.  These personas detract from the overall feel of the album, and tend to leave the listener confused.  I have to give her kudos for wanting to sing about issues in her life, but I think we've been treated to the \\"my father left me...I had a hard knock life...\\" creed long enough.  Her life must not have been THAT bad, she ended up on the Mickey Mouse Club when she was a pre-teen.  Come on, Christina.  We know you've got more in you than this.  You can do better.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Afer watching a poor copy on VHS for 25 years, it is a pleasure to own a crystal clear DVD version.  The 25th Anniversary Edition includes insightful and candid interviews that help put this classic into perspective.  What a bonus it is to see some of the stars as they are today, discussing the impact of this wonderful film on their lives and the lives of the fans. Pumping Iron never fails to motivate me to go to the gym, and this new version entertains and motivates while adding another dimension to the experience.  This is storytelling at its finest.
B00006CXSS|5.0|excellent service and quality.  price cannot be beat anywhere online.  would buy from again!
B00008J2PG|5.0|The movie is very enlightening as to the real role of the Church during ww2 ..it is historical fiction.
1401384145|5.0|Very interesting, counter to common economic theory. Good variety of examples to support the thesis.
9707704667|5.0|The infinite variety of the Bad Girl's treacherous behavior and her \\"victim's\\" willingness to fall for each  <br />reinvention, time and again,  a testimony to the \\"victory of hope over experience\\" (to quote Artie Shaw).  A great immersion into an anti-romantic romance! <br /> <br />However, there is a serious subtext:  the stigma of class and illegitimacy in the Peruvian society cannot be surmounted or healed, rob the Bad Girl of her humanity.  In the end, it is a tragicomedy.  One of MVL's best.
0743298020|5.0|It was hard to put down this well-plotted book. The author kept me guessing with all the twists and turns. Her characters were alive and unique, and the setting beautifully described. The story kept me interested to the end.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool have consumed me for many years now.  It's sad to say I see Maynard sailing the Sell-out sea.  It wasn't always like that.  I couldn't have expected this album to take any other route.  With the growth of Lateralus, it was apparent what direction they were going.  I knew what to expect.  When I heard the album for the first time, I was pleased.  Justin, I tip my hat to you.  Though the bass in this album is not the most difficult to play, to write it in the context, it's one of a kind.  He took ahold of the Paul D'Amour touch on Tool and took it to a new level.  I especially enjoyed The Pot.  Good raw fun that made me want to beat a politician.  I also have a profound respect for Adam Jones.  You know your guitar, and you stand alone in your genre. Danny Carey is why I started listening to Tool.  He is one of my biggest inspirations. He rocks, and like a fine wine, he gets better with time.  Maynard needs to get back to the root of what he stands for.  I pray the media doesn't spoil this great singer.  I was disturbed watching him on a bootleg show.  He turned away from the mic and his words continued to flow out of the speakers.  He's getting older i know, but he needs to be honest with himself and his fans.  He is a crucial thred in the fabric that is Tool.  Hopefully he can prevent his demise, then Tool will prevail.
0375505091|4.0|Be prepared, this book is dour.  The photos are raw, and unblinkingly personal, I often wanted to turn away, but they are beautifully photographed, by the great Leibovitz.  The pictures of Susan Sontag and of Leibovitz's father dying, where powerful and hard to get out of your mind.  I do wish however, that she had put a description on all of the photos, there are many that I have no idea who the person is in the picture, but maybe that's what she intended, I dont know.  Very powerful images, not for the faint at heart, but beautifully realized.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I own the A&E Pride and Prejudice version on DVD and I love it. It is one of my favorites.  This version offers the 2 discs of the original program plus extras.  The extras include a 120+ page glossy book detailing the making of the movie.  Actor selections,location scouting, fashion designs and hairstyles of the times as well as an interview with the star of the program, Colin Firth. <br /> <br />Colin Firth is the definitive Mr. Darcy.  I've read Jane Austen's book over and over and now picture Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. The last pages of the Pride and Prejudice glossy book cover an interview with Colin Firth. As you know, Colin Firth is the main reason this version is a perennial. <br /> <br />The 3rd disc includes a biography of Jane Austen from the Biography Channel.  It is delightful.  A must have for avid Jane Austen fans. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this collector's DVD set to give as a gift or to update your DVD collection.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|I was really pleased with the Star Wars Triology as I have always been a  <br />fan of the Star Wars Films.  This set has several enhancements add since  <br />being re-released that filled in several gaps from the original versions. <br />I would highly recommend this product to Star Wars fans and to Science <br />Fiction fans who have never seen them.  Order them, view them, and enjoy <br />and I an sure that you will be as satisfied with them as I have been.
B000H305U0|4.0|This is the second album from JT that I have really liked. His songs on this album are very Prince-esque (like). I loved Sexyback, so I bought the album. Every song on the album is good, except maybe one.  I was not a JT fan until his last album. I gave him a chance and I really like his grooves.
0684859106|5.0|Makes you want to go to New York - and taste the real thing - the recipes are that good!!!  Either buy the book - or stop in the bakery - or better yet - do both!!!
B0007PALZ2|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this movie because of the plots twists and turns. Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt both delivered excellent performances and contributed much to the intrigue of the story.  While this one might be a bit out there for the general public, I found it to be a white knuckle ride and couldn't wait to get back on. Probably not a \\"first date\\" kind of movie, but if you're wanting a story that grabs your attention and then throws it down the stairs, along the lines of Pulp Fiction, this is it.
0743454537|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  It really made me think about the politics of organ donation and the hardship of having a child with a terminal illness.  The story is told from the perspective of each family member as well as the lawyer representing the well sister/organ donor.  I really felt compelled to side with the well sister, but as a parent I could empathize with the parents as well.  This book will keep you up late until it's finished...a great read.
B000GDH9J6|5.0|Margaret Mead is reputed to have said, \\"Never doubt for a moment that a small group of committed, thoughtful people can make a difference. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.\\" In MOUNTAIN PATROL, Director Chuan Lu demonstrates, indeed, how a small group of Tibetans made a difference in the vast and harshly beautiful region known as Kekexili (which the movie tells us means \\"beautiful mountains and girls.\\"  <br /> <br />In 1985, machine-gun toting poachers began ravaging Kekexili's herds of Tibetan antelopes for the furs, to be sold in the West. By the mid-1990's, an antelope population that numbered over a million had been reduced to less than 10,000 and was being hunted into extinction. Volunteer patrols of local Tibetans, including both the Wild Yak Brigade and the Kekexili Mountain Patrol, began their own efforts to block the poachers and protect their native wildlife. This story, set in the winter of 1996 and presumably based on true events, describes the efforts of the Kekexili Mountain Patrol and its leader, Captain Ri Tai.  <br /> <br />The story line revolves around Ga Yu, a reporter from Beijing who is sent to Tibet to investigate the death of one of the Mountain Patrol's members at the hands of poachers. Ga Yu arrives a seeming novice in Tibet (even though his father was Tibetan) just in time to witness the slain patrolman's funeral ceremony. The deceased receives a sky burial, in which the human remains are chopped up and fed to vultures and the rest burned. Director Chuan Lu juxtaposes this form of human ritual with the appearance of vultures and the burnings of carcasses (antelopes, trucks, jeeps, etc.) throughout his film. Captain Ri Tai (Duo Buji, a dominating presence on the screen) reluctantly agrees to let Ga Yu accompany his patrol as they set out in search of the main band of poachers. Along the way, Ga Yu begins to understand that this search is more than just a policing action. It is protection of a venerated way of life; Kekexili has a sacred and primal place in the hearts of its people. As one character notes, the thing that haunts him about the land is that when he sets foot in a place, he may be the first person in all of human history to do so in that particular spot.  <br /> <br />Ri Tai and his men (a former university student, a highway checkpoint worker for loggers, a taxi driver, a soldier, and a herder, among others) encounter a pelt carrier and a group of skinners, led by the wonderously terse but endearing old man, Ma Zhanlin (his real name as well as his character's name). In a clever moment of environmentalism, Chuan Lu has Old Ma tell us that he and his three sons were once shepherds, but the grasslands disappeared and they switched to skinning antelopes for the poachers for about sixty cents per pelt. In the end, Ri Tai finds his poacher and refuses the latter's bribes in the name of justice and preservation of the antelope herd. None of this is achieved without a price, however, and Chuan Lu exacts an enormous and often tragic toll on all the players in this cat-and-mouse game.  <br /> <br />Chuan Lu's pacing in this movie is magnificent, slowing things down enough to mimic the pace of life (and the difficulty of breathing) in the Tibetan plateau yet keeping the action moving. The cinematography is breathtaking, both magnificent in its range and horrifying in its ferocity. Grays and earth tones predominate, so much so that the movie borders on black and white in places. Chuan Lu mixes Nature's basic elements - fire, ice, wind, water, sand, snow - into a stew of factors waging their own natural war on the patrol even as they as at war with the poachers. No one can mistake Kekexili for what it is: a majestic but unforgiving land where survival is a daily battle for man and beast. The battle between poachers and patrols make up a small piece of that larger struggle. This is a deeply felt exploration of the relationship between man and Nature and the role of human faith in the primacyof his natural environment.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Final Fantasy games and FF7 in my view is the zenith of the series.  No doubt I was looking forward to the release of the FF7 movie and anxiously pondering just what could the artists at Square possibly do to beat and at best match the achievements of the game's storyline.  My conclusion was that the movie would just be an opportunity for Squre to show off their CG skill just like they did with the other FF movie The Spirits Within, which I would describe as visually awesome but written by retarded pre-schoolers.  Indeed, I was worried the movie would be shallow and lack any real substance in dialogue and story.  Well, I'll be brief in my review and state that this movie was a complete success.  However, this movie is a gift to the fans of the FF7 game more than anything else.  It does justice to the main characters of FF7 by bringing them to life as never could have been done almost a decade ago on the Playstation.  I will not get into the details of the story (no spoilers) but I want to stress that it is perfectly setup in the beginning as the events in the game are summarized and connected to the present.  The story is not rushed and real effort was made by Square to build the tension between characters leading to an unimaginable climax and battle at the end.  The only negative is that those viewers who have not played the game will feel lost, but I think ten minutes in they won't care about that and will just want to enjoy the ride.  If you want to see a movie like never before then Advent Children is a must see.  Again, this movie was made especially for the fans.  Thank You very much Square.
0689865384|5.0|One of my friends had given this book to me to read. I began reading and was instantly immersed in a world of uglies, pretties, and hoverboards. I love the references to the \\"rusties\\" which are what the author calls people in our time now. It is a wonderful book and now I am dying to read the second in the series.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Both the CD and the 2004 concert DVD are inspiring. The range and quality of the performances by the five artists, as soloists and in ensemble, as well as the arrangements and selection by the director/composer are superb. The accompaniment is equally impressive. The 2004 concert DVD is topped only by a live performance ... which I was priviledged to enjoy during the Celtic Woman US tour in summer 2006.
B000H305U0|5.0|This CD is spactacular. Nice music, exotic fusions and great lirics. Justin and Timbaland did a great job putting it together. I cant think of a song I am not loving.

B000ICM5VW|3.0|I got this movie early with my Xbox 360 HD-DVD drive. I give it 3 stars not because of the picture quality but becuase the movie its self is only ok. Its kind of long for my taste, the whole part with the dinosours unnessary, and could be cut to make the movie shorter.
0061122416|4.0|this book gave me much to think about. although the story seems rather simple and is easy to read, there is much to contemplate. great for group discussions!
0743454537|3.0|This is an interesting novel, conceptually.  But is flawed in execution.<br /><br />13-year-old Anna was conceived through preimplantation genetic diagnosis in order to be a perfect match for her sick sister who needs various transplants over the years.  When it comes to Anna's mother demanding a kidney from her, Anna pushes back for the right to make her OWN choices about this, even though she loves her sister.<br /><br />The concept is interesting and timely.  And certain elements of the novel are real.  Anna loves her sister, but also wants to be her own person with her own life.  Successive chapters are written from the first-person viewpoint of various characters<br /><br />However, you may be bothered by some of the following:<br /><br />-- Anna's mother is completely one-sided and undeveloped as a character<br /><br />-- Anna's first-person narrative sounds ridiculously older than that of a 13 year old.  I don't care how fast she had to grow up - her voice is that of an extremely well-read and educated adult.  Not believeable as a 13 year old<br /><br />-- The \\"romance\\" between two of the characters is the cliche'd \\"I hate you ... but secretly I love you\\"  Absurd, transparant, and from the pages of a cheap romance.<br /><br />--  If you can't handle endings that cheat you, then you should avoid this book.  I won't give the ending away, but imagine if it was something like \\"So we're at the climax ... but wait, then a meteor hit Earth and so it didn't matter anyway and no one had to deal with tough decisions or whatever, The End\\"  It's just absurd and ends the novel without dealing with any of the story that's been built up.<br /><br />Anyway, so in sum, an interesting concept.  And for the most part, a good read.  But if you get emotionally invested in a good book and get bothered by instances of poor writing or endings that cheat, you should avoid this book.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The actors deliver outstanding performance.  Love the movies that take time to show romantic development between the main characters and this one delivers it...from a woman's perspective.  Strike scenes go on for a while in some parts of the movie, but it is understandable given the period and the emphasis on the pressing issues of that time.  Actually, the theme of the movie is not too far off modern times.   <br /> <br />Loved the striking scenes depicting the differences between North and South and its characters.  Glad to see there are people who can see both sides of the issue.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|It seemed as if even when Dylan went to the bathroom people would listen for sounds and try to find meaning in them. He kept repeating that his words meant nothing but nobody would accept that answer, everything has to have meaning. But, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar (Somebody else said that).  The true phenomenon is that Dylan had the power to make us believe there was more. He exposed the plastic society that he lives in by just being himself. With this album he lit a fire under the folk music stage and gave lots of people some hot feet. He is the ultimate rebel without a cause. The opening lyrics to Highway 61 are classic mental slapstick.
0446528056|5.0|I always buy Nicholas Sparks' new books the week they come out and this one was no exception. <br />I've just now finished Dear John and just loved it.  Garrett Blake and Taylor McAden were always my two favorite <br />characters but now John Tyree has joined them. He's the epitome of the good and decent military man <br />caught up in a romance that might or might not succeed.  I liked Savannah and Tim too but it was John's <br />dad that caught most of my sympathy.  His reunions with John (especially at the end) were tender and <br />heartwarming and were actually the only times that I cried. This is a really <br />wonderful book and I highly recommend it.  <br />    <br /> <br />
0805047905|5.0|I got this book by request of my son (3), who knew the book from daycare (they sing a song with the text of the book).  Since we got the book it must have been sung over a hundred times!.  My son take the book and pretend he's reading by singing the text while looking at the pictures, he knows all animals in it (also all animals from similar books like, panda bear and polar bear, wich I also got for them).  My girls (2 year old twins) also love the book and try to do the same as their brother singing the little song.  This book is a must have for the creative parent!
B00069A5GY|5.0|I have played both discs on my High End Pioneer system, and I am under the impression that there is an interview on the DVD-A. <br />Can't find it. <br />Any ideas please. <br />Being a Lonnie Donegan fanatic this is the first mention of him by a musical artist. <br />The first on the British scene with American spirituals Lonnie turned them into great hits before any of the big names of the sixties arrived. <br />Thanks Mark
006112429X|1.0|This is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read.A very well written,engrossing story that makes you think long after you have put the book down.I recommend it for any book club-you will talk about it for hours!

B000GG4KTU|4.0|I loved every one of Diana Krall's releases until \\"The Girl in the Other Room.\\" It was a departure from her usual kind of songs, and though I tried to like it, I could not. \\"From This Moment On\\" is far better, in my opinion, but I still don't think it comes up to the standard set by her earlier releases. See if you agree, but to me it seems to feature her piano playing much less. That was a big disappointment to me. She is a great singer, but I like to hear her play too. I really missed that on this CD.
0380715430|3.0|As other reviews have pointed out, Bryson appears to have little more than an amateur's understanding of the history of the English language and linguistics in general. This book is riddled with numerous factual errors and simplifications regarding the origins of words, as well as the grammatical properties of other languages. Most irritating, Bryson propagates the Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax (the idea that Inuits have hundreds of words for \\"snow\\"), which has been proven false time and again from linguistic experts.    A couple of the later chapters of this book are interesting and well-written, particularly the one about the historical hostility that British people have for American English. Here, Bryson provides multiple quotations and citations from the past to show the British enmity for American English.     But earlier chapters are repetitive and boring, as they read like endless word-lists. After multiple pages of reading factoids and funny-sounding English words, and clever-seeming wordplay, the reader gets tired.    For someone interested in language, or in the history of the English language, I recommend the better-written and factually-accurate books:    \\"The Language Instinct\\" by Steven Pinker    \\"The Adventure of English\\" by Melvyn Bragg
B000IAZ6W4|5.0|This is simply an incredible album that deserves so much more recognition.  <br /> <br />Mostly piano driven with secondary textures ranging from military drumming to glitch, the mood is set as mellow and light with moments of uplifting bombast. Jeff Buckley, Elbow and Bell X1 are easy comparisons. <br />
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Have seen both versions of this Jane Austin story and where this shorter version doesn't detail the events and the aftermaths of those completely the casting is great.  The older version was horribly cast but did indeed cover the story at full length.  Having already read the book I was happier with the shorter.
B000025OG6|3.0|I'll say right off the bat that I'm a big Toto fan. Their writing is invariably interesting, all those guys can PLAY. This time, the album tackles a harder-rock sound. They execute it well, but it's just not my favorite genre. \\"She knows the devil\\" is a killer track. \\"Jake to the bone\\" is an instrumental that is one of the best tunes Toto's ever done, and alone is worth the price of the album. Imagine hard rock, sans the tight pants and fake blond hair, played by guys who can write and who can PLAY, and you've got yourself a better album than most of what's out there. If you want image, don't bother with this album. If you want MUSIC...take a listen.

Better then his post-humous \\"Big Picture\\" it's a shame he died way before his time and before he got to blow up and get the props he deserved. Short, at only 12 songs, you get to hear some of the rawess talent ever on a microphone in the rap game. Guests only rap on 2 songs so you get to hear a lot of this talent. Of the 12 songs, 1 Is a classic, 1 is ok, the other 10 are good or great songs. Production is great for his raw, gritty, street style and handled by some very good producers. Lord Finesse does 5 songs, BuckWild does 4, Showbiz does 2, and Craig Boogie does 1.

B00005JPB4|5.0|Clint Eastwood's \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" focuses on a pivotal event in World War II.  In February 1945, the Americans attacked the well-fortified island of Iwo Jima, which was populated by an army of well-prepared Japanese soldiers.  The Japanese had no intention of surrendering, since they considered Iwo Jima to be sacred Japanese soil.  On the fifth day of the bloody thirty-five day battle, American soldiers proudly raised the Stars and Stripes atop Mount Suribachi.  Soon thereafter, the first flag was lowered to be kept as a souvenir and a second flag raising was photographed by Joe Rosenthal.  Newspapers across the United States published this now famous image and it soon became an iconic symbol of valor.  Three of the six flag raisers died on Iwo Jima.  The remaining three were shipped back to America and ordered to tour the country and raise money for the war effort.<br /><br />These three soldiers, Rene Gagnon, John \\"Doc\\" Bradley, and Ira Hayes, were not entirely comfortable being labeled \\"heroes\\". Their superiors cynically informed them that participating in the government's propaganda campaign was necessary in order to sell war bonds.  Therefore, Gagnon, Bradly, and Hayes had no choice but to go along in spite of their qualms.<br /><br />\\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is an earnest and touching film about the mythology of war.  In order to maintain public support for their costly military endeavors, governments need to convince skeptical politicians and ordinary citizens that victory is within sight and that our men are not dying in vain.  America's military and political leaders used Gagnon, Bradly, and Hayes as pawns to shore up flagging morale and persuade citizens to sacrifice their sons and their hard-earned income to pay for the remainder of the war.  When the fighting ended and the soldiers had outlived their usefulness, they were abruptly cast aside and forgotten.<br /><br />The battle scenes in \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" are harrowing and graphic.  Eastwood shot some of the film in Iceland's forbidding landscape, and these stark black and white sequences show exhausted, grimy, and terrified young soldiers trying to survive from moment to moment as they watch their buddies being blown away all around them.  When a man is injured, bright red blood oozes from his gaping injuries.  The carnage is wrenching and heartbreaking.<br /><br />The screenplay, by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis, is based on a book by James Bradley, Doc's son, and Ron Powers.  At times, the dialogue is difficult to follow, especially during the deafening and confusing battles, many of which are shown in flashback.  Eastwood explores a number of themes in \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" one of them being racism in the military.  Black soliders were segregated, and Ira Hayes, a Native American from Arizona, kept a frozen smile on his face when he was called \\"chief\\" and \\"redskin.\\"  After Hayes returned to the states, he started to deteriorate emotionally and turned to alcohol to deaden his pain and guilt.  This man who stoically endured verbal abuse for years was disparaged for being a disgrace to his people and to the uniform.<br /><br />Eastwood makes the point that asking our young men to leave their families and risk their lives to fight for their country may be a regrettable necessity, but it is nothing to celebrate.  A dead hero is still dead, leaving his grieving family to suffer forever after.  Medals are no substitute for husbands, fathers, and children.  The performances are all fine, but Adam Beach stands out as the disillusioned and tormented Ira Hayes.  The cast is basically an ensemble, with all of the actors contributing their part to the effort, much as their real life counterparts did back on that deadly, rocky island over sixty years ago.n Iceland's forbidding landscape, and these stark black and white sequences show exhausted, grimy, and terrified young soldiers trying to survive from moment to moment as they watch their buddies being blown away all around them.

B0000683DH|5.0|This is a great Star Trek...If you know the original series then you will know that Kirk is going up against a enemy from the past...And the end of the movie is the lead in for Star Trek Three the Search for Spock.....You will love this if you are a Trekkie...
B0000257U0|4.0|There are some great moments on this one. \\"Slipped Away\\" is my favorite, and \\"Dave's gone skiing\\" is an instrumental that is (if this is possible) actually kind of funny (there's a second syncopation thing that has an unexpected twist, particularly if you're a musician and have played this genre). I don't know why Toto gets slammed by critics for being technically proficient. I'm going to argue if you're interested in MUSIC in the rock genre, you're going to have to look hard before you find a band better than Toto. If memory serves, this is Simon Phillip's Toto studio album debut, and he plays great.
6305971935|4.0|Okay, by today's standards, the special effects are a little on the hokey side, but, considering its age, the movie does just fine. If you want to just sit back, relax, and escape for awhile, this movie fills the bill.
0821221841|5.0|Ansel Adams was one of the best photographers, and reading this book has been an honor and has really advanced my knowledge of how to use the camera.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I love this soundtrack. Every time I play it, I think of the movie and how wonderful it is. The composition of the music is what makes the movie, and this soundtrack does the storyline justice.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|OK, maybe this movie is a bit corny and unrealistic(it takes place in London in the winter and it never rains once)but when I'm feeling low, I can pop this DVD in the player and feel much sunnier.  This is quickly becoming a Christmas classic for our family and friends.  Very charming!
B000H7JCG4|3.0|I'm just glad that this is on DVD. I agree with everyone about how crappy it is to have the music switched, especially on the scene where Dylan and Brenda are breaking up and it's Crowded House \\"Don't Dream it's Over,\\" (I don't think that is season 1) either way, that scene will die without that song, but it's better than not having this show on DVD at all, because it seems that the reason why it took forever was because of the copyright negotiations, and obviously they couldn't make a profitable deal to keep the music.    [...]     \\"When a song is cleared for usage on a TV show, the clearance typically only applies to television airings of the show in question. Thus, when the show is released on DVD, the rights to the song must be renegotiated in order for the song in question to be included on the DVD.    If the process of clearing the rights to the song is prohibitively expensive for the company releasing the show on DVD, or if clearance is refused by the copyright holders of the original song, a number of solutions can be chosen from. The affected song is usually replaced with a similar (sound-alike) one which is cheaper to license or the footage containing the copyrighted song is edited out; depending on the show and the television company involved. In a few cases, television shows which use so much copyrighted music such that the cost of licensing is high are withheld from release on DVD (one notable example is WKRP in Cincinnati).\\"
0316286850|5.0|I have to say that I am a huge fan of Kevyn. He was truely the best, and although I didn't know him personally, I know he was truly a master at make-up, THE BEST! It is a down right tradgedy that he is no-longer with us, thank God he left us his \\"secrets\\" in works of literature like, Making Faces. Like Kevyn, I have been playing with make-up since I was 5. This book has absolutely great photos, step by step procedeures, and is very easy to follow. Did I mention it has great photos? I'm a graphic designer by trade, and this book impresses me thoroughly! In my opinion Making Faces is a must have, for anybody into make-up, girls and guys. 5 stars!
B000063UR2|5.0|This is a fantasy, it has it's Hero, it's Villian, and a damsel in distress!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I have to say that I was floored by this new Josh Groban CD...FLOORED !! I have the previous two, and the growth displayed in this new one is hard to measure. The courage it must have take for him to leave the familiar and comfortable world of the 'safe' and venture into S.A. music (Weeping), the world of funk and groove (the Herbie Hancock offering), the etherial and haunting Now or Never with Imogen Heap (!!!) and his own February Song, it's hard to fathom. And beyond the wonderful orchestrations and interesting melodic twists, he also revisits one of his strongest suits, interpreting romantic and often sad ballads in Spanis and Italian.  The future is so bright for this artist I can't imagine where he'll be in 10 years, but I hope it's Broadway, but only after he conquers the world. Nobody I've ever followed as a musician works as hard as this man does to bring this unique style and open emotional 'converstation' with his listening public (and he has a huge one already).  Bravo Mr. Groban and don't change a thing, you're on the right track, your OWN track and I cannot wait to see where it takes you, and us your avid listening public.   <br />Favorites?  February Song, L'ultima Notte, Lullaby/Weeping, Machine and definitely Now or Never with a bullet !

B000FIMG68|5.0|This season of Lost is great! not as good as the first one but thats the way it always is. My wife and I got the first season on DVD a little bit after it came out just because it was on sale and we had never watched the show before and thought it might be good... this show is freakin AWESOME! We watched the whole first season in like 3 days, and kept from watching any of the second season till it came out on DVD and bought it from amazon the day it was released, actually we pre-ordered it. Anyway, we got it for a great price from Amazon, it was delivered pretty quick and was worth EVERY PENNY!
0312979479|5.0|'And Then There Were None' is the harbinger of today's horror.  Written in 1939 by Agatha Christie, the novel skyrocketed the Mystery Mistress's career.<br /><br />Ten people are mysteriously summoned to a infamous island retreat.  When the launch leaves them on the landing at the isolated house on Indian Island, they are cut off from the world.  Their mysterious host is missing when, after a lovely dinner, a harsh announcement from a recording permeates the room, accusing each person of a diabolical crime.<br /><br />Cradled in fear, everyone wants off the island immediately but there is no way off.  One by one, people begin to die.  With each suspecting the other, they must wait for the launch to show up, or for their own death.<br /><br />'And Then There Were None' still holds a certain charm for me, and remains one of the absolute best 'whodunnits' of the century.  The prose is simplistic enough for young adult reading, and for the advanced reader it's a bullet-though-a-gun read that you won't be able to put down.  Perfect for reading on an airplane or at the beach.<br /><br />I first read 'And Then There Were None' as a young adult, and while re-reading noticed that though the prose is not very stylistic or grand, the plot alone is enough to keep you turning pages.  This short, smart novel is a 'must read' for any mystery or horror lover.  Enjoy!
B00005JO1R|5.0|The film is well done.  A little dissappointed with the pacaging but it is ok however I would give the packagaging only three stars.  The music was well done while the director enjoyed \\"Rock and Roll ruby\\"  I did not have the same feel. I grew-up with the music of the mid and late 1950s \. throughout my life Johnny Cash, Elvis,Carl Perkins as well as Roy Orberson were those I ejoyed along with a number of other but they were always apart of who I listened to especially Johnny Cash. <br /> <br />I am please overall with the film as I do think they got the feel of the lives like all biopics nothing is the absolute truth but they did a excellent job overall.
B0000683DH|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  Much better than Start Trek 1.  Too bad they could not make it a 4 hour 2 part move with Recardo in both movies.  Good special effects showing damage against the hull without shields.
B000GIWS7E|4.0|This DVD is the best representation I have seen yet on Dream Theater.  Not that others have been bad, but this is the best.  I experienced one flaw in it, which disturbed me a little.  There was a dead spot on one of the song performances, which might be inherent with the \\"live\\" filming.  This is why I would limit my rating to 4 stars.  Overall, it is a great DVD to have if you are a fan of great progressive rock.
B000001DWG|5.0|Andrew Woods was a brilliant pianist and awesome singer.  Mostly 80's sounding \\"Hair Band\\", which is excellent.  Two songs off the chain; are, \\"Man of Golden Words\\", and \\"Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns\\".  Overall; this is an excellent CD with a very distinct sound.  One of a kind.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This is a great series, with lots of twist and turns. Having the series on DVD you can watch it again and again. The more you watch the series the more you see and understand.  <br /> <br />The extra bits called connections was hard to use and very similar to that used on the abc website, which was very simple to use. <br /> <br />I must say that in the case of this series, i recommend that you to see the first series to understand some of the characters in full. Although it is enjoyable as a stand alone series. <br /> <br />But i admit i am a BBBIIIIIGGGG!!! Lost fan and always want to know and understand more.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I consider Sound of Music one of a few all time classics. I think it's right up there with movies like \\"Gone with the Wind\\". You also get an extra DVD with the 40's anniversary edition which I found very interesting and entertaining. It's another must have for every movie library.
B00000DCHI|1.0|I bought this never having problems from Amazon.com before.  They did not state that this was a Sony product and when I received it, all the CD had on it was a root kit virus.  It would not even play in my CD player.  When I tried to read the CD to copy and burn the \\"WAV\\" files to a new CD so I could just listen to the music, all there were on the CD was executables and no sound files. <br /> <br />Sony is very poor quality now and I do not want to buy it again.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy DVD I purchased all came in on time .  My son who is a fan of Star Wars just love it.There was no problem whatsoever.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Sweet, sweet, sweet and beautiful. I don't care what any others say on their reviews.  I think that it is fine they have their opinion, but the fact is that Mr. Groban's taste, sound and style are fresh, different, unique and so set apart from all else in music, it is hard to tire of him. No one can touch him. Hey, the \\"Tiger Woods\\" of music!  I agree the voice is impeccable.  He could sing \\"Row-Row-Row Your Boat\\" and he would sound outstanding. (thank goodness the taste is a tad bit more sophisticated than that!) A testamony to the fact; No sooner did I have it on my desk at work the day after release, and a colleague had snatched it away for their own listening pleasure. :) I do think this is the album that has the most \\"pop\\" sound of all three. They are not wasting his talent.  The day I feel that is happening I will give any work less than 5 stars.  Favorites; Romeo and Juliet, February Song, Un Dia Llegara.  Enjoy everyone..........I know I will.
B00000F14B|5.0|I had a VHS tape copy of this movie for years and wanted a better medium for long term storage.<br /><br />I think this is the best musical ever produced. Robert Preston has been imitated but never equaled.<br /><br />The music, story and all star cast make this a must have for any library.
B000G8NY4U|4.0|An Audio & Visual delight! <br />Yanni has brought a whole load of musicians together from the world over to perform his music with him. Recorded in DTS sound and filmed using Hi Def cameras to produce a clear widescreen picture. <br />The lighting used at the concert is just brilliant and adds to the entertainment it gives.  <br />My only comment is that he allows the musicians to get a bit carried away with themselves detracting from his music a little. <br />However this would not stop me buying this DVD or recommending it to anyone . <br />Thoroughly recommended. <br /> <br />Dave B  <br />Great Britain

0393327655|5.0|An incredible eye opener.  Sam Harris presents in a logical, well documented fashion, a way of looking at organized religion that, I think, lurks in the back of many of our minds.  Reading it coming from someone else, someone schooled in the field, brings that thinking to the front of the reader's mind, and makes it impossible for it ever to go back. <br /> <br />Mr. Harris does a great job of describing the problems at hand, but as with many authors who tackle big problems, his attempts late in the book at suggesting solutions are somewhat weak. <br /> <br />I'll trump Mr. Harris's declaration that he is an 'atheist' by saying the book affected only how I view organized religion.  It didn't shake my belief in the existence of God one iota. <br /> <br />\\"It's not necessary to have something to believe in.

B000I5X81K|3.0|Not sure what's going on here, but this is the second straight subpar effort put forth by Josh Groban. His Live at the Greek CD/DVD was a far cry from everything he had put out previously, and this album, while sprinkled with a few choice cuts, simply lacks that magical concoction (music and voice) that was at the forefront of both his self-titled debut as well as Closer.  <br />Please don't misunderstand...I think he is brilliant and there is some really good stuff here (February Song and La Ultima Notte in particular), but I am generally disappointed with the overall product and have to question the direction his career is headed. We shall see.
1401207138|5.0|After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I decided to go ahead and purchase this product.  I will admit that it was not what I expected, but after the first issue I was hooked.  Very engaging story that took many dark twists and turns.  Highly recommended.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I down-loaded the new cd for dead man's chest, onto my ipod, although the music was great, it didn't have musch of the songs that I loved in the movie.  So I bought this cd, and their they were.  Such as the sword fight song between Jack and Will, and Jack and Barbosa.  Forgive me for not recalling the specific titles of the songs, I don't have the cd with me right now, but everytime I hear that music, specially to those particular scenes, I can't help but smile.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|You need to get familiar with Madeleine Peyroux! Her music is nice and <br />easy going, has a nice \\"dance\\" beat to it. I like Norah Jones, but hadn't heard of this vocalist, so thought I'd try her album. This is not her <br />most recent album, but listened to the songs on this one and I liked them <br />better. Her voice has an older quality to it, different than Norah who you can tell sounds more youthful, but her style is just as refreshing for <br />a young woman singing some \\"older\\" music. I probably would buy other CD's <br />of hers. Really liked it. Even my 35 year old daughter liked her style!!
0743454537|5.0|Very well written, and presents ethical challenges of having one child to save another.  The emotional status of each family member in a family with a dying child is well represented.  These feelings and assigned roles took place in my own family so I can say with certainty the author hit the nail on the head in examining the individual impact.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Yeah, okay so I haven't listened to MCR's other cd's, but this concept album is awesome! Sure, I heard a little bit of Pink Floyd in there, and <br />some oddly familiar sounding riffs from the 70's, but it's catchy and it <br />ROCKS - if you don't mind the dark theme, which I do not take too seriously. The producer of Green Day's 'American Idiot' produced this piece of work too, no doubt his influence is here, but if MCR was encouraged by their record company to make an album that appealed to the <br />masses, with the dark theme about death, not everyone would want to sing along with \\"You're Dead! No one ever had much nice to say, I think they never liked you anyway!\\" But I do. <br />
1594200106|5.0|Bar none the best first sentence of any book I have ever had the pleasure to read. And the rest of the work only gets better every time I read it. I have had to purchase a new copy; I read the old one literally to pieces. Highly, Highly recommend. Story telling at its finest.
B000IFSDZQ|5.0|This massive box set is great for any casual fan of Roxette and anyone who wants to hear more of their songs (and let me tell you that yes -- there are songs better than The Look, It Must Have Been Love, and other \\"very common\\" greatest hit songs\\"). <br /> <br />Roxette is probably the most underappreciated and unknown bands in America. People worldwide know their songs, but how many people can say \\"It Must Have Been Love\\" was sung by that great Swedish Band Roxette? Not to many -- especially Americans. <br /> <br />I have purchased this set and recieved it. Very well laid out -- Two Discs in the Front and Three in the back (including the DVD). I had imported this set from Sweden and can say it was very brilliantly put together. I love the 65 + page booklet full of high quality color and black and white photos and alot of unknown and interesting information as well as music theory behind the band. <br /> <br />When this set is released in America on December 26th, 2006; I predict it will be very popular and the band will make a very popular comeback in the United States -- since they have been gone for more than 10 years. The United States has not had a greatest hits released with a good record label (Capital Records) as well as great promotion.  <br /> <br />The outtakes included in this set are fantastic except the horrible song \\"Better off on her own (demo)\\". <br /> <br />The Song Myth reflects the mid-90's period style of Rock music, and is a great song -- if not one of the best demo's ever. <br /> <br />New World -- is by far the most brilliant song ever with it's 1950's rock chords/styles. This is one song that is very catchy and stays in your head all day. <br /> <br />The two new songs One Wish and Reveal are as well very good. Reveal reminds one of a 1960's ballad -- which is what the style reflects its hard to believe this is not a \\"Beatles\\" song. <br /> <br />Brilliant idea Per Gessle to compile many tracks that have been scattered over the years on thisone box set! <br /> <br />The DVD is great all the videos and the MTV Unplugged Show -- Warning: If you do not have a DVD set that will support PAL format -- the disc will not work  -- I have found that this disc works in my computer and on my portable Durabrand DVD Player -- the portable DVD player can be plugged into any Television set. Americans do not have to worry about the region because there is not region set on the disc, only the PAL format -- (United States uses NTSC)! <br /> <br />There is too much information and songs to cover in this set, my suggestion is listen to the track samples and get a feel of what this set is all about, if you are a fan of Roxette, 80's, 90's or the music of today -- this set will not disappoint because there is something for everyone here.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|My Chemical Romance had just released their third album THE BLACK PARADE 2 weeks ago. Yesterday, I just bought the Album, and IT was amazing. Here is a breakdown of the tracks:<br /><br />THE END: 9/10: An intro to the album, representing death. It's a great way to start the album.<br /><br />DEAD!: 10/10: A great song, one of the better ones on the album. \\"Well, motherfu**er, If life ain't a joke, then why aren't we dead?\\"<br /><br />THIS IS HOW I DISAPPEAR: 8/10: A great song, and kind of sounds like \\"It's not a fashion statement, It's a fu**ing deathwish\\" off of their 2nd album.<br /><br />TRACK FOUR (forget the name at the moment): 10/10: An amazing song.<br /><br />WELCOME TO THE BLACK PARADE: 10/10: The first single off of the CD. Kind of has a Queen-is influence if you think of it. The video's also creepy.<br /><br />I DON'T LOVE YOU: 10/10: A good song, a slow one but still great.<br /><br />HOUSE OF WOLVES: 20/10: Best song on the album! The beat is very great, and the words just fit.<br /><br />CANCER: 6/10: An good song, but only gets 6 because it's kind of depressing song.<br /><br />MAMA: 10/10: A great song, with awesome lyrics.<br /><br />TRACK 10 (forget the name at the moment): 7/10: Another great song.<br /><br />TEENAGERS: 9/10: A funny song about how teenagers keep getting depressed.<br /><br />DISENCHANTED (SHUT UP AND PLAY): 10/10: Another great song on the album.<br /><br />FAMOUS LAST WORDS: 10/10: The 2nd best song, I hope this is the next single.<br /><br />BLOOD (hidden track): 9/10: A hilarious song, and a great closer.<br /><br />So go buy this album. And enough of the whole MCR= Emo thing, they're FAR from emo.
0446528056|2.0|I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and have read every one of his books many times over.  I was really anticipating this book, but felt disappointed while reading it.  The writing style is very casual, awkward and lacking \\"spark\\" between John and Savannah.  It often seemed more like a stiff, researched play by play of the day in the life of a soldier rather than a classic Sparks love story.  The most redeeming quality of this book is the love story that developed between John and his father, which moved me to tears.  Although this turned out to be my least favorite Sparks book, I will not hesitate to pick up the next one on release day!
0974872407|5.0|Excellent, this is a must read!  And if you speak spanish I would highly recomend to read this book in it's original language.  It has been one of the best books I've read lately. <br />
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|This CD is a must have.  It is romantic and incredibly passionate.  Great background music for entertaining, too.  Lots of feeling and great rhythm. A+++++ throughout, a rarity!  Don't miss this collection.  It's  highly, highly recommended.
B00005JO9J|5.0|i have gone back and watched this entire season twice. i love it! very dramatic, but a great series.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh's voice is full of emotion and power.  He can move the listener because his voice conveys honesty and passion.  I never tire of listening to this album.  \\"You Raise Me Up\\" is an inspiring and hopeful song.  Even when Josh is singing in a foreign language, I can still understand the feeling he is trying to convey.
B000H305U0|2.0|This is CD is pretty good in everything except that it has explicit lyrics.  Honestly, I hate dirty words so that is why I am giving it 2 stars out of 5.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|David Gilmour proves he can still put together an meaningful record.  His voice is mesmerizing and his guitar work is everything a Gilmour or Pink fan is looking for.  While David Gilmour will always be in the shadow of his former works, he has proved with \\"On An Island\\", that he can stand alone and cast a few shadows all by himself.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After watching the film Serenity (which is based on this show), I had to go back and watch the series, and I'm certainly glad that I did!  This is one of those shows where the action is always high and the dialogue is snappy and usually pretty funny.   <br /> <br />Nathan Fillion is perfect as Captain Malcolm Reynolds, a veteran of the War for Independence who wound up on the losing side.  After Reynolds abandons his faith and tries to move on with his life he purchases Serenity, an antique space vessel.  His only goal is to get work, keep food on the table, and keep flying.  This becomes difficult with the addition of two passengers on the galaxy's Most Wanted list. <br /> <br />This show was heavily influenced by themes in Western TV and films -- bank jobs, train robberies, transporting cattle, saloon fights, and the like.  The characters reflect that:  A captain who basically lost a lot during the last battle of a conflict styled after the American Civil War, A mercenary, a Doctor, a whore, a preacher, etc.  Put all these diffferent kinds of folks aboard the Millenium Falcon, and that's Firefly. <br /> <br />And it is definitely the most fun you'll ever have watching TV.
0553456504|1.0|I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so.  He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it.  He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics.  I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world.  All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later.  Still lots of people think he is great
B00003CWN3|4.0|This is a story about a girl who has felt neglect, or she just wants to escape the bonds of the people she has known, it seems, to search for a girl who will accept her as a boy even though she's also a girl. At least, this is apparent in the movie, and neglect may not be true to Teena Brandon's real life. I'm sure there were people who loved her, but none of them were shown in this movie. She was set in a place where she was alone much of the time, living in a small home or trailer with her brother. It's sad to see neglect in so many people who are gay, though. I would say most really have heart. I have gone through neglect with my family or felt that they don't care enough or don't know how to care, and there is sometimes a sense of abandonment. We choose to leave; after some time we finally meet trouble and perhaps return to them. Then it's like they don't know us. No one knows us. And \\"us\\" I mean all of us. We're all in that situation, it seems. This movie displays what we are after neglect, searching for people who will fill the gap. To see this movie, you may agree that the characters are actually still children who have all felt neglect and are at the bottom of it all, working jobs they don't like. I really liked Hilary Swank in this. It was a very daring person to play. These people really knew what they were doing. I admire the efforts of the director as well, to see time pass in fast forward with music in Nebraska. The color and mood of the whole movie works to display Nebraska as desolate and sparse and superficial where the lead character is opposite of that with a lot of heart and curiosity leading her to trouble, which I also display in my writing. I'm from Nebraska and wrote a novel set there, which I intended to write to see it as a movie. I go by the author name Ian Bradley. Still not published, though. I give this movie an above average rating because it really works as a dream and is not overly raw. It makes me wonder why people like her end up with enemies. She deserved to live and be happy. And for those who like Chloe, she's worth seeing in this. A real Nebraska side of her and not so NYC as in KIDS.th enemies. She deserved to live and be happy. And for those who like Chloe, she's worth seeing in this. A real Nebraska side of her and not so NYC as in KIDS.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pulse is a terrific arrangement of classic Pink Floyd including pre and post Roger Waters songs.  Old and new fans alike can't help but be enthralled with the selections and the unbelievable laser and light show.  It will blow you away.  Especially enjoyable are the extra features, in particular the bootleging the bootlegers was a nice touch.  All in all this dvd was worth every penny.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Beautiful sounds that send us to the heart of middle-earth. This is the best work of Howard Shore ever.
B00005U122|5.0|...with all the songs that RW has written for the band. It's interesting to contrast this work to Pink Floyd, Live at Pompeii (1970 ish), and Pink Floyd's new Pulse DVD.  One song, Comfortably Numb, is so skillfully performed on RW's DVD that you can tell who wrote/sang the different parts back when it was part of The Wall.  This DVD is a treasure for the RW and PF lover.
068987474X|5.0|Definitely a book all women must read, no matter where you are in life right now.  It's straight to the point, funny and the best part, very uplifting.  It takes a lot of the guessing work out of relationships.
B00030DEQE|4.0|I'm satisfied with the performance with this product.  I went from transfer times of 15 to 20 mins to 6 to 8 mins on files of 3.5 gigs and higher.<br /><br />This card was installed on a ghz network, the machine is a p3 1.0 ghz & 1.0 gig ram - (I think that it's 800 fsb)<br /><br />the only down side is the software that came with the card.  It adds a routine to your boot sequence which adds time to your boot.  I don't mind because this is not my main system but it might be an annoyance if this is your primary system.<br /><br />Other than that this a worth while investment to increase transfer speeds.
015603008X|4.0|Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes is sure to be a classic that will be remembered by the hearts and minds of all those who read. It is the story of a mentally retearded man who receives an operation that will help him learn faster and easier than any normal person. He is then given the opportunity to live a normal life- somethimg he nas never had the chance to experience. Along the way you see his grammar, spelling, and social skills improve through his progress reports. The main character, Charly Gordon spends much of his time writing about the painful flashbacks he experiences that force him to remember his bad childhood as he is made fun of and pestered. You see Charly transform from a child in a mans body to a regular person which helps you to see that the difference between misfit and \\"normal\\" is not a very large gap. His IQ improves nearly 100 points and his social skills jump considerably. AThroughout his journey he encouters Miss Kinnian, who he falls in love with, Alghernon, the mouse who has the same operation as Charly, and his next door neighbor Fay. As his mental capacity increases, he begins to experience new emotions such as jealosy, hate, and love. A great read that is difficult to put down, Flowers for Algernon is sure to entertain all who read it. I would recommend this book to all who are capable of comprehending the story and willing to alot enough time to read page after page in this great book. It really is a great book that should be read. <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Extremely good value, something for everyone from funk to harmonious acoustic to hard rock with raw unpolished but effective guitar solo's.Two CD's for the price of one, how can you argue with that!
B0002KVULG|5.0|This is probably one of the best Dracula movies every made.  It's not overly goory or violent.  Dracula, played by Frank Langella is captivating.  He really did the character of Dracula justice.
B000274THQ|4.0|People like me who lived through the fall of the Berlin Wall (1989) but were a little too young at the time to be paying much attention will like this blast to the past. Much of the wit is summed up in one of the scenes (which is only seen in the deleted scenes) when the lead character's friend mentions his situation is a little like the delicate situation in \\"Back to the Future\\" (a big hit that was just reaching the Eastern bloc at the time the movie is set). The tale revolves around a boy who has to keep the past alive for the sake of his mother's health and it illustrates both the excitement of those who experienced the west for the first time and the betrayal (in this case felt by his mother) of those who upheld the former regime. It's a clever look at social change in general and a bit of history that hasn't yet been seen often in film. I loved it.
0743487486|5.0|This is the first book on parenting that does not offer just another method for controlling your kids but offers the radical viewpoint of looking at your children as little persons that are worthy of your respect, guidence and love without conditions such as good grades or even good behavior. This book shows you the beauty and benefits of loving your child just because they are, not because they do.
0385512058|3.0|This book/cd contains a wealth of infomation.  For my personality, the networking style suggested throughout the book/cd does not fit for me.  Of course, there were gold nuggets that I noted to incorporate into my networking style.  I ended up passing it on to my district manager, who is more suited to this style, for his road trip. J.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|good action, typical bond even though it was not part of the  <br />\\"broccoli\\" series
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Following the series of Firefly, Serenity continues the story line for a few  more steps.  There are so many ways this movie is packed I cannot begin to properly mention them here.  The storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a \\"solving the mystery\\" approach.  The english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand- mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing.  The animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality.  The characters are complex, focused, solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations.  The challenges the crew of Serenity face are many: from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority \\"Alliance\\" forces to the overt mortal threat of the \\"Reavers\\".  The climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue.  The music in Serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more.  I suggest seeing the series Firefly before watching the movie Serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|While listening to this new offering from \\"The Voice\\" I was struck by the departure from what most fans would feel is Josh's \\"style\\". Were there some tracks I don't love? Yes, one of them is what will probably prove to be one of the most commercially successful tracks on the album and one about which Mr. Groban himself has said he is especially passionate--\\"You Are Loved\\". Are there some tracks that left me speechless from the sheer beauty, emotion, and power found in the voice of this incredibly talented young man? Yes, \\"February Song\\" and \\"Un Giorno Per Noi\\" are two that come to mind. What came through to me most was that this artist is unafraid to change and grow even if that means releasing music that some in his wide fan base may not understand or appreciate. This admiration grew after viewing the accompanying DVD and listening to his comments on the ideas that eventually culminated in \\"Awake\\". I think that both old and new fans should be grateful that an artist whose work they admire is willing to take risks to be true to HIS vision of who he is and what messages he is passionate about and wants to express. The vast range of musical styles in this album, from African influences in \\"Lullaby\\"/\\"Weeping\\", to the incredible emotions invoked with his foreign language offerings, to the jazz inspired collaboration with Herbie Hancock on \\"Machine\\" convince me  that the coming years will continue to show just how very versatile Josh Groban truly is and that we will never have reason to say--Josh Groban's new album? oh, same ole, same ole. Another aspect that should impress most listeners is the wide range of talented artists who contribute to this album; it's a wise thing to surround oneself with others whose musical presences not only speak for themselves, but who also enhance your own talent. I actually have the special edition that includes three additonal tracks, the last of which is the Charlie Chaplin classic \\"Smile\\" which was a nice added treat and, in my opinion, worth the extra cost., worth the extra cost.
0375505091|5.0|This is a beautifully produced book. Annie Leibovitz's humanity and humaneness comes through powerfully. The introductory text is heart wrenching, especially when she describes aspects of her relationship with the late Susan Sontag. \\"A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005\\" is a magnificent documentary of a life of rich accomplishment.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Short Circuit has to be one of my favorite childhood movies. Back then I didn't even understand most of the keypoints in the movie or a lot of the dialog. I love it more each time I watch it. It's one of those movies you just grow up loving. Even though it's old, and you can tell, you'll still be entertained greatly by the lovable robot Jhonny 5, and his great robot personality. It gives you a good feeling when you finish watching, and leaves you smiling. <br /> <br />I bought both Short Circuit 1 and 2 from Amazon and am very happy I did. Both were in excellent condition and very fairly priced. I was so surprised to find both in DVD form at all. So thanks!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly has a well woven storyline with well developed characters.  I like the humor and the interplay between the characters.  The producers have paid attention to some of the problems that plague space adventure stories such as outside vessel animation done with complete absence of sound while not trying to make everything scientifically perfect.  It is good how the equipment and scenes are aged and dirty as you would expect for anything that has been around a while in less than pristine conditions.  Storylines continue throughout the series making each episode a must see right through to the end.  The music is engaging and is of such quality that it should have its own CD (I find I am watching parts of the DVDs just to hear the music.)
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is by far his best album.  He goes for meaningful yet witty lyrics and the music is a mix of old and new.  I can't stop listening to this one!!  My favorites are \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\" and \\"I Don't Trust Myself\\".  This young man has had a lot more life experience than his age would suggest.  We need him around for a long time!!!
B000G8NXYG|5.0|akira kurosawa's masterpiece gets the 'do-over' from criterion. this is by all accounts the definitive dvd version of this landmark film, absolutely no question about it. i have had this disc since the day it was released and i have yet to look at all of the extras, let alone watch the movie all the way through. i'm one of those frame-by-frame, shot-by-shot viewers. i have seen the film several times over the years, mostly on criterion's original release of the film, this is going way back. if you have never seen this film don't waste your time with any other version than this one. it does not disappoint. KYDU
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Christmas is not the same without this movie. It's a wonderful movie to watch w/the whole family and reflect what really matters in life. I still cry at the end even though I've seen it so many times. It's definately a Christmas classic.
B000GG4KTU|4.0|This album gives us what we have come to expect from Diana Krall. She combines a smooth, throaty, feminine jazz voice with a fine understanding of the blending of lyrics and music.<br /><br />I would not say this album is her best. But it is as good as any, and well worth the investment.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Great set of season 2, I enjoy this one alot more then the first set. Don't get me wrong the first is great too, but so much has happened since season 1. Which makes this more fun to watch. I can't wait till season 3 comes out to dvd.
0792163710|4.0|Down here that is what we used to call Westerns.   I really don't care about the colour or the acting.   I just enjoy these type of Flicks.   I'm an oldie now but Flicks like \\"Shane\\" can transport me back to Saturday at the Pictures.   Love it.   Well worth watching over & over.   Beside that I was taller than Alan Ladd.
6305511055|5.0|If you like your movies filled with a good story line, suspense, intrigue, and Robert Redford, you'll enjoy this movie. The CIA stuff and a guy stuck between a rock and a hard place make this movie one that you don't want to press the pause key on your remote to get a snack. A movie made in the mid 70's really is a quality film. Great shots of the World Trade Center with a scene actually taken from within one of the Trade Center Towers. Limited profanity and killing. Just enough to give the film the reality to deal with the subject matter. A guy flick for sure, but Redford will not be too hard on the eyes for the women. No disappointment purchasing \\"Three Days of the Condor\\".
0553382179|5.0|Marla is a sincerely caring woman who has gone from a cluttered, out of control home to a clutter free home supported by minimal daily routines to keep it that way.  She has been there and she lovingly brings you out of it with small steps backed up by exploring how your environment reflects how you feel about yourself without being too much of a mushy self-help book.  She brings hope to the overwhelmed.  Great book!
0316172324|5.0|Though you shouldn't be suprised if you've read Tipping Point, this is a great book.
031286504X|5.0|This is a book that is supposedly about vampires, but in fact it really ends up being about normality and stereotypes. If you are interested in a book that turns normal genre roles on their head this will not disappoint. I am not much interested in vampire nonsense but this was so highly recommended by a friend I had to read it and it justified the praise. Interestingly enough it also deals with the question of boredom: What would you do if you had all the time in the world and no one to talk to? The extra stories at the end are quite short and look more like aborted attempts at novels, skim read over them, one or two are worth a read. However, the main feature deserves the reputation it has.
0767830555|5.0|I saw this when released in 1976 - lines around the block in NY to see it on opening week. It scared the pants off me and after didn't want to get a cab in NY for some time. After seeing it again when it went to VHS, it still gave me chills, and again in DVD- it's a Scorsese master work of film and Robert Deniro about as weird and bone chilling as one can get. A great film for a cold night and a big bowl of popcorn; and lock the doors!!
B000FQ4M58|3.0|If this is the last at bat in Meat Loaf's music career, it would be fair to say that he has hit a homerun but not the grandslam he was most likely looking for. The album was produced by the renowned Desmond Childe and features songs written by Nikki Sixx and Diane Warren and Desmond himself, and also features guest performances by Brian May and Jennifer Hudson (a finalist on American Idol a few years back). Jim Steinman, the creative genius behind the first two Bat albums, was not involved in Bat Out of Hell III, although it does feature seven of his songs under the direction of Childe and Loaf. <br />      <br />The original Bat Out of Hell was borne in 1977 and was mired in a wave of skepticism and confusion upon its release, and although it took some time to take off, the original Bat still flies as one of the top selling albums of all time. And why not? It featured songs such as \\"Paradise By The Dashboard Light\\", \\"You Took The Words Right Out of my Mouth\\" (and the clever intro Hot Summer Night), and \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\". These songs were fun and appealed to a wide audience -- from the teenage kids with raging hormones to the adults relating to experiences of hot summer nights, it is an album which will still be selling fifty years from now. After all, horniness, motorcycles, and guitars will always be around, and this album managed to capture all of these elements and then some. <br />      <br />1993 brought us Bat Out of Hell II. Meat Loaf would win a Grammy with the song \\"I'd Do Anything For Love\\", and the tag of comeback artist of the year. The lead single hit number 1 in countless countries and propelled the album to commercial success. The sound was different than the original Bat: more down to earth and reflective than its predecessor, but no less different than what made the original popular -- it defied the commercial music of its time and forced people to LISTEN. It made no attempt to be like anything else; in fact, it seemed desperate to distance itself from anything that the public was used to. It was what it was, and it still is a great album. But without the huge success of the lead single, the public most likely would have never caught on and the album would most likely have faded away after a couple of months. And songs such as \\"Objects In the Rearview Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are\\" would have gone unheard by many. <br />     <br /> Now we have Bat Out of Hell III. Name recognition alone guarantees that it will sell its share of copies, units, or whatever adjective you care to use. Like Mike Tyson, no matter when, where, or who he fights, there will always be those willing to pay to see him perform simply because he used to be great. No amount of publicity will make him better, but it might help sell a few more seats and pay-per-view tickets. The same could be said for this album. The first two Bat albums were a surprise and caught the world by storm; this album was actually released in full on the internet two months before its release (and the title track, \\"The Monster Is Losse\\", could be heard five months prior). The lead single \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" was a hit for Celine Dion a scant ten years ago, not long after the Loaf's hit \\"I'd Do Anything For Love\\". Meat Loaf could be seen on TV and in baseball parks throughout the U.S. and heard on countless radio stations well before the release of this album, and although I am a die-hard fan of Meat Loaf (yes, I do own and enjoy his albums that don't include the words bat out of hell) I couldn't help but think that he was desperate. Despeate to be accepted. Desperate to be popular. Desperate to go out with a hit. Everything that a Bat Out of Hell album is not. A Bat Out of Hell album could care less if you like it.  <br />      <br />And this album does indeed sound desperate. A guest performance by Brian May on a song titled \\"Bad For Good\\" that Meat no longer has the voice for. A guest performane from Jennifer Hudson on a song titled\\"The Future Ain't What It Used To Be\\" that turns a good song into something you might hear from a black choir at Sunday's church services. A song titled \\"Cry Over Me\\" that fits into the pop culture but not the Bat legacy. \\"Seize The Night\\" sounds like something trying to be a Bat song but fails. Like the dork taking drugs to fit into the \\"in-crowd\\" but not quite making it. <br />      <br />\\"Blind As a Bat\\" and \\"In The Land of the Pigs The Butcher Is King\\" sound like Bat songs, and they both work, although the former was written by George Michael instead of Jim Steinnman. \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" is outdated and doesn't belong, although the Loaf does a good job with it. Land of The Pigs could have been a hit on the harder rock stations -- \\"Meat Loaf you say? The Anything For Love guy?\\" Yeah, something different, something unexpected, something that goes against the norm -- but instead they go with the expected, tired and tried formula that Meat Loaf has been using since Bat Out of Hell II smashed the charts. \\"Cry To Heaven\\" is the final track on the final Bat album and it is a fitting end -- this album didn't quite do it for me so I will \\"cry to hell\\". <br />      <br />There are rumors that there may be some kind of \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" encore. I hope these rumors are true. I hope that if they are true that Jim Steinman will be in charge. Maybe then we can have some closure to an otherwise great trademark.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is just the right amount of romance and social injustice wrapped up together.  Anything more to the end of Charles Dickens becomes depressing for me.  But it is not a light hearted romance like Pride and Prejudice or Wives and Daughters (which I love).  North and South has very serious social themes but remains enjoyable to watch over and over again.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|by far John's greatest work. I feel like he is going to be here for awhile, he is the real deal. He is improving with every song, every cd. He is on his way to greatness!

0800177177|4.0|Visually superb with Gothic overtones.  Dracula is a frightening creature, and yet shows a sad and lonely soul looking for eternal peace and rest. Dracula is capable of love and yet fears it's  ultimate consequences...A mini masterpiece truly acted and retold.  Gary Oldman's performance is breathtaking!
B000GPIPVU|3.0|its a good cd, it grows with every listen. at first I found it a little mute, almost like every song was the same song all over again. it is getting better with each listen though. I still feel that it missing a little edge, could have added one song with some punch to it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Granted, when I first heard the album I was falling in love and on a cloud already, but Nora's vocals, soulful lyrics and graceful energy made me think my cloud was never coming down... and it didn't.  Yeah right. Oh but it was sooooooo perfect while it lasted. lol.
B000H305U0|5.0|i love it, the beats are unreal. this cd makes your body move whether you want it to or not, this is a great cd. i love the way its orchestrated, the arrangement of the cd, very good.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|Bored and flipping through stations I stopped on a video from this. With 70 gigs of tunes, most of them Reggae and Jamaican Popular- it is hard to suck me in, but this did. WHAT??? Billy Holiday without the heroin???? Well, that is what my brain said- this is a voice, straight up. I bought it immediately and it is great- do yourself a favor and put some good music into your collection. Yeah, kinda embarassed to be buying a \\"pop\\" album, but at least her da is West Indian (but mot Jamaican) anyway- nuff said- buy this now.
1400049628|5.0|It's most amazing how the author have accumulated all this info, performing a strict and blood-cold analysis of everything that could occur in general to you when encountering the living dead.<br /><br />Adding the recorded encounters and outbreaks of zombie through mankinds's history (second half of the book) makes it very believable indeed that a zombie virus exists out there.<br /><br />There is good feeling of safety in the book, that you have a chance to make it through in any such event. One such motto in the book is: \\"Zombies feel no fear, why should you.\\"<br /><br />To sum it up - it's a good, entertaining read with occasional adventurous day-dreaming (those new enemies offer a myriad of unorthodox possibilites).
0694526088|5.0|Fantastic book, and as a CD even better. Making 45 min communting a pleasure. Collins an inspirational reader.
B00006JIA4|5.0|The product was exaclty what I asked for.  Chock full of Queen hits that should satisfy any queen fan!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|It's so nice to see an artist who has survived decades and decades of changes in music styles and is still going strong.  Every song in this album is first class.  Thank you, Bob!
0446677450|4.0|I think this book should be required reading for any parent and even the grown children should probably read it. In my view the advice is a little basic for someone who is experienced in investing and money management however it's still worth a read.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Great movie my kids love it, and I would have to say I like it as much if not more than they do.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Last of Bowie's pre-Ziggy folk/art/hippie albums, preparing the runway for take-off.  Any album with the line 'the girl with the mousey hair' just has to be great, doesn't it?
0060776757|4.0|This book looks like a coffeetable book, but don't let its looks and heft fool you. Its filled with tiny print interviews with the band members. I've been reading for weeks and I'm still only halfway into it.  <br /> <br />The coffeetable format is annoying when you are trying to read that much. Its too bulky and large to hold comfortably.  <br /> <br />Its like having two books in one...the coffeetable picture book and then a large reading book too. <br /> <br />The interviews are fascinating but obviously very carefully sanitized to protect the members' privacy.  <br /> <br />However, for any serious U2 fan, a must have.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Except of some of horror scenes (at least to much for someone who hates this kind of stuff), this show is one of the best ! My favorite part is the relation between the 2 brothers and, of course, Jensen Ackles's character \\"Dean WInchester\\" who is simply the best !  I can't wait to have the second season on DVD ...
B00070Q8DQ|1.0|zzzzzzz..i fell asleep listening to this, its boring. the voice is boring and theres nothing is really oustanding here.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I'm still floored every time I here the magical sounds of John, Mike, John, Jordan, and James come together. Once again they out did themslves. Every moment of this DVD is worth watching over and over again. The fact that decided to bring in a full orchestra still blows me away. Just hearing their music that they spend their lives creating and perfecting pour through the fingers of the talented musicans that were in that orchestra has to be one of the top highlight of their lives. Thank You Dream Theater for being the most complete and talanted band ever.
B000FGGE68|3.0|Jovovich was great as always in her action movies. I liked the action, special effect and all the neat stuff like the anti gravity belt. However I felt the movie lacked a grasping plot that would keept my attention. I rewatch it to see the fighting scenes rather than an enjoyable plot.
0596009208|4.0|The good:  +large text with many examples  +starts from the very basics and foundations/fundamentals of Object-Orientated (OO) programming practices instead of just focusing on syntax  +varied exercises to reinforce concepts  +fairly inexpensive    The less good:  - sloppy/skimpy index; hard to use as a reference book  - some of the \\"fun\\" elements get in the way of finding information fast (especially if you're already accustomed to dry programming books)  - could be thinner by cutting out some graphics  - no CD    Overall:  =worth your while if you're new to OO programming.
B000C3H4MC|4.0|I have yet to be able to play this disc at full 96K audio resolution. All of the DVD-A players I have tried it on choke on the DVD-A track. <br /> <br />That being said, they can all access the regular DVD Dolby 5.1 track, and while that isn't as good as the unplayable DVD-A track, it still sounds great. The remastering is really top notch, and the surround format works very well with this highly percussive and multi-tracked recording. This is one of my favorite albums, and it has never sounded better. A huge improvement over the original CD release. <br /> <br />Which is why it irks me all the more that I can't get to the DVD-A track. I bought two other Talking Heads DVD-A discs, and they all exhibited exactly the same problems. The whole set should have been recalled. This disc is just good enough that I won't send it back, but if had been any lesser recording I would have demanded my money back.
6305090564|4.0|This one of those good old horror movies. <br />Beast hunting us humans also one of Treat Williams best movies. <br />Also i'm supprised that there's was no sequel because the movie's ending suggested that.  <br />
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Bob Dylan is great as usual. Very enjoyable album.
B000B8QG22|5.0|<br />This is one of my son's favorite movies and he lost the VHS tape. <br /> <br />This is based on a true story of a military disk jockey in Vietnam.  He doesn't follow the rules and has conflict with his disgruntled commanding officer and gets involved with the local people. <br /> <br />One of Robyn William's better works.
B000GG4KTU|3.0|I am disappointed in this CD. I love Diana Krall and have several other CD's, but this one is a let down. A few good songs, but most of it is slow and boring in content. Maybe it's the song selection, I'm not sure. But it is well produced & sounds great. Hope her next one is better.
B000FIMG68|5.0|It was in excellent condition and arrived quickly. It was also enjoyable to watch, but I knew it would be. It's one of the best shows on television now.
B000BCE918|5.0|What can i say it is only $20 bucks for one great movie and two descent movies.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|As usual, Erykah Badu hasn't disappointed us.  This is another young talented black women with a message for her listeners. Can't wait to hear her next cd.
B0001I55OC|5.0|i thought this was a good movie..mainly because gerard butler is in it and he is a very good actor
B00005K3OT|5.0|Simply a beautiful movie. Those that have given this a bad review are sorely mistaken. It is a slow but touching story that keeps you entertained the whole way through. <br /> <br />I still watch my copy at least once a month. You will not be dissapointed with this purchase. Give as a gift!
B000002U8G|5.0|This is my favourite Pink Floyd album. I don't want to describe it song by song. You can hear that guys were still looking for their own sound, mostly in the first half. There're many styles of music from completely progressive to bluesy. The second part is once song only - The Echoes with everything that good song needs, nice melodic link, perfect arrangements and many musical ideas. Even though it's over 20 minutes long you never get bored and you can listen to it again and again.  <br />What I really like on this album is the easiness of all the stuff, you feel that guys were enjoying the time in studio and didn't take themselves too seriously. Just listen to San Tropez or Fearless and you'll know what I'm talking about. <br />Great album, I really recommend.
B000068UR5|5.0|Having never heard of Analog productions before I was a bit reluctant to spend almost $30 for this hybrid SACD, but decided to try it out.  This is the most impressed I have been by a Super Audio CD since \\"Kind of Blue\\".  Very good presence and none of the stridence which can interfere with my enjoyment of tenor sax at times.  Analogue productions has very high production values indeed.  They claim on the label that the high quality of the sound is due to their proprietary all-tube tape mastering equipment with the latest DSD transfer technology.  I will buy more SACD's from them starting with another Sonny - \\"Way Out West\\".  I may buy their whole catalog :-).
0975991477|2.0|I felt it was very scientific and difficult reading.  I wasn't able to get past 20 minutes with this book although I am sure by the title it has great information in it.  I don't feel it's for the average person more medical / scentific minds.  Truthfully, I feel my money was wasted and wish I would of took the time to return it.
B00029LNHS|1.0|What an outrageous group, how can anyone like this rubbish. Maybe an horde of brainless people. How I feel happy in being intelligent, and live my life with things of absolute quality and not consuming this kind of food for mediocres. How said Romans, \\"it's just bread and circus to the poors\\". Give to people what they deserve, rubbish! It's because you mediocre people that buy this, that this kind of people, the members of this group, get money and laughs behind the scenes about how dumb people can be. It's the same horde that buy, Beyonce, Spears, Madona, and other outrageous poor music.  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br /> <br />
1932100660|5.0|The Drs. Campbell have written an excellent book. Finally, some people who use actual research and lots of it to give advice.  I also learned how much the government, industry, and most academia is so ... wrapped up together.  I went to Medline and PubMed and searched out some of the studies, and so far, I've not found a single one that contradicted what Dr. Campbell has said in his book. So... eat lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, whole grains and nuts.  Strictly limit dairy and meat, sugar and processed foods (or better yet, cut them out altogether).  I just had my cholesterol tested, after having lost 15 pounds, and it's about 145 (down from 295 just a few years ago).  And best of all? I've got more energy than I've had in years.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|I'm a traditionalist and a purist so I liked the original better.  But this movie is worth the purchase and the viewing time.  I expected a rehash of the \\"Poseidon Adventure\\", but while the premise is the same, this is a different adventure story.  So as far as remakes goes, this is quite original, entertaining and will keep you on the edge of your seat!
0321344758|5.0|This book has tons of useful information about designing beautiful websites without forgetting the end-user.
0618477942|5.0|Absolutely spell-binding story.  This book conveys a very sad and puzzling life with extremely funny technique.  It lacks the little current event things of Bechdel's regular strip, but has such interesting visual appeal that you don't miss them.  I grieve for the stunted life it seems her father had, and hope that her generation of Bechdels have it better.   <br /> <br />
B000AJIAOO|5.0|I'm sure the first thing most of you are going to see is the price tag. Honestly, it does seem a bit steep, even for an import. And when you can get the same cd minus two bonus songs for half the price, why not go the cheaper route? <br /> <br />While I don't typically spend so much on a cd, I must say this is worth it. When I heard \\"Jane Doe\\" on a message board I frequent, it immediately became stuck in my head. I had to have that song; it was so amazing.   <br /> <br />The whole cd is just as good. The closest I can compare it to anything would be Evanescence.  But as much as I love Evanescence, and with all respect due to Amy Lee, I must say Within Temptation is better. Sharon has a crisper, better-trained voice. The intensity given to each song is astounding. I certainly got my moneys worth from it. <br /> <br />As for whether \\"Destroyed\\" and \\"Jane Doe\\" are worth paying twice as much as the same album without, it was for me. \\"Jane Doe\\" is what started my obsession. \\"Destroyed\\" has become my number one favorite.  <br /> <br />But even if you decide to get the version of this album without these two songs (which if you haven't personally heard any of their music, may be the smart way to go), rest assured it's well worth the money.
089898890X|5.0|I bought this book after playing professional jazz gigs for 4 years. It is authentic and a great place to start for beginning to intermediate jazz drummers. The CD is a nice accompaniment.
B000002BYA|5.0|SRV and friends play up a storm. Herein are arguably the definitive recorded versions of \\"Cold Shot\\", \\"Pride and Joy\\" and \\"Things That I Used To Do\\". The horns really add warmth to the sound, but Stevie Ray is front and center. Eric Clapton has said he was in awe of Stevie Ray Vaughan for his flow; the way solos just poured out of him, and there are some blazing examples on this recording. <br />Yes, the man was a great guitar play, an absolute master of the form, but something that is rarely mentioned is that his singing was as emotive as his playing. He was in great voice on this night too.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|I enjoyed this album and even went see them in concert - they were the opening act for Red Hot Chili Peppers - trust me stick to the albums my ears were bleeding by the time they finished playing.
0316548189|5.0|Excellent autobiography that should be required reading! Mr Mandela has written thorough life history of himself and of the struggle for freedom and equality in South Africa. As long as it was, I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B000002A3T|5.0|I thought The Division Bell is a wonderful CD.  I only purchased it after watching AOL's Sessions archive with David Gilmour.  He played it there.  I have to say his rendition in 2006 is better than the one they originally did.  But the album has lots more to offer.  Don't miss it.  And push for David and company to do some Pink Floyd's best now.  They play and sing better now than they did back then.
B00000IREA|3.0|Everyone, this is the what Jane Fonda looked like before she became an actress, and before \\"Monster-In-Law!!!\\"  Great clothes by the designer Paco Rabanne, horrible special effects, a blind, flying angel, a kinky dame in black leather, silly dialog.  What more could you ask for!!!!!  Campy, but fun!!
1401302378|5.0|Anderson has written an important study of the ramifications of entering a new world in which consumers are offered near infinite choice. This should be read by anyone who wants to understand how the Internet impacts marketing and distribution.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I am a HUGE Lost fan.  My schedule changed for work, so I was no longer able to watch Lost on Wednesday nights.  I was happy to see that I was able to pre-order Lost for a cheaper price then the MSP and also get caught up on last season!  I will be looking forward to when I can pre-order the 3rd Season!!
0060899190|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It is one that you want to read over and over again.  I am definately going to get the other two that just recently came out.
0596007124|5.0|This is an excellent reading material with good explaination of the concepts.
B000002WUD|5.0|I was listening Elvis when I was a school boy and now after 30 years I listen Elvis as if he were back to life again and singing to us.  I was encouraged by Elvis' songs and again they are encouraging me now in the 21st century!
B000EHSVS2|5.0|George C. Scott is magnificent as George S. Patton! <br />Although the movie has some inaccuracies- some of them showing Patton in a less than favourable light- Scott manages somehow to successfully raise the character above them and make us care for, admire and respect the old general, who was in fact a far superior soldier and a far superior man than those who tried- and those who still try- to belittle or criticize him.  <br />George S. Patton said \\"It is the unconquerable soul of man, not the nature of the weapon he uses, that insures victory\\", and thanks in great part to Scott's portrayal, we see and feel Patton's soul, the soul of a true warrior, which was much needed them, and, I fear, we still do today. Although it is very likely that he would be treated as unfairly today as he was back then, if not more so. <br />This is a movie worth wachting for many reasons. It may not be precisely a History lesson, but it is certainly is good lesson on what it takes to be a soldier and what it takes to be a man.  <br />
B000FP2OPY|4.0|I really enjoyed the first season of Supernatural, two brothers looking for their father after he disappears during a hunt (the bond between the father, John Winchester, and the two sons, Dean and Sam, is that they hunt down any supernatural being that they find killing people, and attempt to kill it). The series starts out with Sam as an infant and Dean about two years old and their mother is killed in the nursery by a demon in front of the father. I find the premise of every episode very interesting with the fact that the brothers never know what they are actually going after and usually have to make up solutions on the fly while still bickering like two brothers would.  <br /> My only reservation about the disk set is the quality. There are some episodes that causes my DVD to slow up and stop altogether. Hopefully I just got a fluke copy so everybody else can enjoy this well thought out and exciting series.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|This is a great flick for people who are irritated by sub-plots because there are none.  There is nothing resembling reality found anywhere in this movie, so it makes for excellent escapism, which we all need now and then.  Since all the characters stay together, it is easy to follow along, so you can turn your brain off, it won't be needed.  Since it's all about the ship, acting wasn't necessary.  You can bet that movies like this toll the bell for the careers of Russell and Dreyfus.  I felt pity for them as actors, and hope they can rebound.  The movie is shorter than most, so there will be minimum impact on your life.  You will remember nothing about it soon after exposure.
B00000DQWT|3.0|I can't honestly say that all of the album is great.  But the tunes which are familiar are masterpieces.  It is worth the price of a CD just to have those tunes available to me to play at my leisure.
1400032717|4.0|Alternately heartwarming and hilarious, Hadden hit the nail on the head perfectly in this one.
B000099T2L|5.0|This CD is Great!!  I play it over and over.  The is one of her greatest work!!
0120884674|5.0|This is a very handy book.  As a forensic science graduate student I have been frustrated with Bass for a long time.  The pictures are just so bad.  The bone manual gives you the great pictures fo White's human osteology in a nice compact Bass sized field book!  A great book to add to your library!
B000E6UK32|5.0|There is no other way to describe BLONDIE or the musical legacy, other than PERFECT POP. Their crossovers  into Punk, Funk, Reggae, Calypso, Disco and New Wave are legendary. THERE WERE AND ARE NO OTHER ROCK ARTISTS AS DIVERSE OR AS SUCCESSFUL........as BLONDIE was in this amazing era of rock. From 1978-1982, and their amazing resurgence in 1999, Blondie have racked up hit after hit after hit. In which time created some of rock music's all time best classics, Call Me, One way or Another, Heart of Glass and Rapture to mention but a few. <br /> <br />The most successful of all New Wave and Punk bands, Blondie helped define a generation and opened the door for the likes of Madonna, Gwen Stefani, Cyndi Lauper, Amee Mann, Berlin, etc. <br /> <br />Here on this compilation you get 4 American Certified #1 million selling singles, Heart of glass, Call Me, Rapture, and The Tide is High. You get an additional 3 British #1 Singles,  Sunday Girl, Atomic and Maria. <br /> <br />Rapture released in November 1980, was the first Rap song the vast majority of people ever heard, in fact it wasn't even called Rap then, it was just known as Street Rapping in the Ghettos of NYC, but it took the then #1 Band in the world to break this musical format wide open. Rapture from the 1980 album Autoamerican also produced another #1 Chart topping first, The Tide is High, was a reggae influenced smash, again a music format that millions never heard until Blondie broke it wide open. GROUNDBREAKING, Blondie scored 3 straight #1 singles in 1980 in USA, Canada and the UK. <br /> <br />Materpiece rock songs like One Way or Another, Dreaming, Call Me and Atomic are simply delicious and infectious songs, you can listen to them over and over. Never dated. <br /> <br />Included on this album, was the European Mash Up Smash that reached European top 20 charts in feb 2006 with Rapture Riders and also hit #10 US Billboard Dance charts in 2006. The mash up uses the #1 Blondie Classic with The Doors \\"Riders onthe storm\\" track, and poof, you have literally one of the best rated Mashups ever produced.  <br /> <br />Heart of Glass & Call Me were the definitive songs that influenced and open the doors for the UK Invasion of Electro Pop of the early 80's. The very fact that Heart of Glass and Call Me were the #1 International selling songs of 1979 and 1980 respectively is now a matter of music history fact. Blondie's music still in 2006, is FRESH and still CREATIVE, and nothing coming out today can compete with the their diversity, songwriting, edgy cool, or depth. <br /> <br />No rock music fan should be without this album, and the added DVD doesn't hurt either. Blondie were in fact the first rock band in history to release an full length video album for 1979's classic album \\"Eat to the Beat\\", which was grammy nominated, so the videos are cool and mega sexy with Goddess Deborah Harry, the original Madonna. <br /> <br />Blondie Fun Facts <br /> <br />......Call Me #1-6wks in the Usa  #1 Song of 1980 and #42 charted song all time <br /> <br />......Heart of Glass  6 Million copies sold Internationally  <br /> <br />......Rapture has gone Top Ten in 3 decades, with 3 different Blondie versions in the USA Billboard Dance Charts (80/90/00's) <br /> <br />.......Maria debuted at #1 19years after Blondie's last UK #1 IN 1999, making DEBORAH HARRY the oldest female then at 55 years to have a #1 record.
0977326403|3.0|Too brief. Lacking in detail. Mr. Collins has written great books, but seems to lack the experience needed in the nonprofit world to write an authoritative book on the subject. That said - I'd still recommend nonprofit executives read it! - Jay Craig
6304711905|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I've probably seen it <br />15 times and recommend it to anybody who likes Westerns.  Kurt Russell & Val Kilmer are great in this film.

0201433079|5.0|This book is literally saving me right now in an Introduction to Operating Systems class I'm taking. We have projects to complete in the UNIX envrionment and the fact that this book gives you every real code example you could possibly need for all levels of systems programming is GOLD. It's laid out in a very straightforward way, has tons of code examples, and is overall awesome. Highly recommend if you're just getting into systems programming on your own, or as a school reference book.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This show is riviting in that the character development and is subtle yet provacative. The show is a fusion of E.R. and Friends. Indeed it is a soap opera, but a very entertaining soap opera. <br /> <br />P.S. The second season is splendid as well.
B0002WYS6S|4.0|Overall, this is an extremely awesome concert. I am a big fan of DT, and like pretty much all their stuff. The performance itself is pretty good, although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and Jordan's keyboard solo. Other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album. If they had done more special things, it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4. Other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance, but  would say they did okay as far as that goes. Sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand, thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him, although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands, and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them. The special features are also pretty good, but i would not buy this concert just for those, backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves. Overall, i did think it was pretty cool, and i would recommend buying it if you like Dream Theater or just their genre of music in general.

B000GG4KTU|2.0|I have been a Diana Krall fan for years. Have all her albums and play them regularly. I felt however that her heart simply was not in this album. The album lacked energy. Just to be sure, I gave it to another DK afficianado and she agreed with me. I trust that this is a career hiccup and not a trend.
6304779607|5.0|Sly is the ultimate cop in this movie. He goes above and beyond his call of duty to protect the innocent. Even when his superiors tell him to chill out and how they want the job done. He ignores them and does things his way. And thats the only way. Especially when it comes to dealing with low life criminals.
0307346609|5.0|This book is an exceptional read.  Every once in awhile we can touch a milestone and this is one of those milestones in the vast Zombie field.  This book should spread into the mainstream and comsume the so-called mainstream.  It is extremely well written, tight, and, yes you are reading this right, researched.  I liked the way the book was organiized and I found what this organiztion contained to be very interesting. Thank you Mr. Brooks for your excellent addition to the Horror genre and literature in general.

A must for anyone who is a movie collector or anyone who just wants to see how romantic comedy was meant to be done.  Surprise ending scare that can only leave you(and apropriately so) with 'Shut Up and Deal'.
0465092756|3.0|Peter Woit has the nerves to take a solid mastermind thought and wipe it of as it was juice stains on a glossy black table. The beginning of the book takes us to the wilderness of modern science. Then, after a while we reach a stage full of backdrop sets that blocks our mind and limits the freedom to look into other dimensions providing ambiguous information that seems to be the holy grail of string theory. Woit is pointing out a very interesting view of a research's inability to succeed. This guy has guts and I admire him for his courage.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|Thank You Criterion. I just finished watching the new 3 DVD set and it is wonderful! The movie itself has been beautifully restored as only Criterion can. The sound is also very well done....there are not enough wonderful things I can say about the job they did on this film.<br /><br />  The third disc is a treat. It was very interesting watching the interview with Akira. The back ground on the movie and the rare trailers were a terrific new addition for this release. Bravo! I cant wait for more!
B000H7JCG4|4.0|I'm a Brenda fan since day one and I'm glad that this cool DVD came out. I'm gonna snag all of the Brenda era DVD's.<br /><br />Anyways, saw on the back of the package that \\"music has been changed for this home entertainment version.\\" Uh oh. Could it be that my favorite scene from Season 1, the \\"It's My Party\\" scene in the Peach Pit from \\"Fame Is Where You Find It\\" would be deleted??? As soon as I got in my car I immediately popped in disc five, and fast forwarded it to that scene - which is still there, original music and all, much to my relief!!! I mean, come on, that's a great number and it's cool they got the rights to that song.<br /><br />The Special Features are kind of corny. The behind the scenes featurette is a featurette that aired on Fox back in the 9-0, it is not a new feature. The Looking Back Season 1 the recap is not a video recap, rather it's just text. Meet The Class was kind of campy.<br /><br />Also, I never really realized how cute Jennie Garth looked. Even though I'm a Shannen/Brenda fan, Jennie looked fresh and nice in here, which is a contrast to how she looks like now on the WB. Oh well, we all age.
B000GFLE86|4.0|Madeleine Peyroux comes across as an artist older than her years. <br /> <br />Even though she is only in her early 30's, her music and voice sound like they belong to the previous generation.  <br /> <br />The fact that Peyroux's voice absolutely reeked of her Billie Holiday influences somewhat tarnished that breakthrough album \\"Careless Love\\".  <br /> <br />For her new album, \\"Half The Perfect World\\", she showcases the emotional core of songs by other singers and songwriters she's admired, and also displays her talents as a writer on four songs she co-wrote, keeping a distinctly romantic edge.  <br /> <br />The CD is slightly less heavy on the Holiday-isms but more intriguing in the song selection.  <br /> <br />For Peyroux tackles the love songs she loves, treating them to timelessly jazzy readings.  <br /> <br />Given the makeover are Johnny Mercer's \\"The Summer Wind\\", Leonard Cohen's \\"Blue Alert\\", Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\", Fred Neil's \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\", Tom Waits's \\"(Looking For) The Heart Of Saturday Night\\", Serge Gainsburg's \\"La Javanaise\\" and Charlie Chaplin's \\"Smile\\".  <br /> <br />The album conjures in the mind imagery of smoky bars, music lifted from the screen of an American feelgood movie. Drums are always light brushes, barely touching the skins, guitars light and fruity, clearly a double bass rather than an electric.  <br /> <br />No cutting edges are approached, no taboos challenged, but it is a pleasant amble through familiar territory.

1932907009|5.0|I purchased \\"Save the Cat\\" while attending a pitch event in LA. I started reading the book while I waited for my meetings. My first two meetings went well but no requests for my screenplay. After I read the first chapter I modified my logline and my pitch following Blake's advice in chapter one. The difference was immediate, the producers I pitched to \\"got it\\" quickly. I had four requests for my screenplay during the rest of day and I believe the difference was the practical advice I found in this book. <br />The rest of the book is just as good. I have purchased seven books on screenplay writing but this is the book that is on my desk while I write. Everything in the book is clearly written with great examples. I was skeptical about some of Blake's statements concerning screenplay structure so I read several screenplays and applied the principles in the book and they all fit. <br />This may not be the only book you will ever need on writing screenplays but after you've read it you will come back to it first when you need some advice.  <br />Buy this book first. <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had not seen the TV series.  This set from Amazon was my introduction.  I absolutely love it!!  I didn't miss the sleek appearance of space ships, costumes and alien monsters that we are so used to seeing.  In fact, they would not have been appropriate.  The core of nine main actors stayed totally in character and did an excellent job. <br />If you enjoyed this series, I highly reccomend also getting \\"SERENITY\\". Although it is a good story by itself, it does tie up some loose ends from the FIREFLY series such as why the alliance was so obsessed with getting River back and also the origin of the Reavers.

B00005JPAJ|3.0|Many reviewers have noted the similarity to Crash in  which seemgingly disparate people and events are somehow related.  Others have criticized the self-referential aspect in which the hum-drum is elevated to cosmic self-importance.  It's another consciousness-raising festival, Hollywood style, and we are supposed to discern deep thoughts and all sorts of hidden meanings while munching popcorn.  Several in line had never heard the Old Testament story from which the title came, proving once again that we are turning out a nation of cultural idiots. We are dealing here with an inability to communicate whether by speaking differnt languages or speaking without listening or saying things without meaning them or perhaps more likely, all our technology has falsely made us think that ease of communication is the same as the act itself.   <br /> <br />In movies like this the slightest question raises a host of possibilites. Is it even possible that these worldwide events could be related?  Brad Pitt is still searching for the BIG ROLE, the breakout movie in which he finally proves he is a \\"serious\\" actor (lol).  Alas, Richard comes across as, well, Brad Pitt playing Richard, which is fine for most of the viewing audience.  One can admire the intricacies of the film, the attention to detail, the thematic relationships (a little heavy at times) and the subtlety but in the end the sum of the parts is less than the whole.  Each vigenette (actually  movie within a movei - this thing is too long!!) attempts a variation on the theme and about halfway through one has an  inkling of how things will turn out.  We are asked to connect to our inner spiritual self which comes across as some global, vague transcendence.  <br /> <br />The Japanese vigenette seemed (and still seems) odd, out of place really.  The Moroccan story was the best of the movie. This is probably a two-week film since most of the moviegoers will jabber about how it touched them while thinking, God I can't believe Ispent $10 on this thing. If it is like the theater where I saw the movie, there was much looking around and asking, \\"What does that mean?\\"  The house keeper, by the way, almost stole the show - much more effective than the big \\"stars\\".
0517092948|5.0|William Shakespeare-the greatest dramatist the world has ever known. With a very impressive output (37 plays, 4 poems and 154 sonnets, all of them beautifully written), he has rightly been called \\"Not of an age, but for all time.\\" This, coming from a rival poet (Ben Jonson) is high praise indeed. The plays, poems and sonnets are very difficult to review individually, as they are well written. Shakespeare brilliantly captured the essence of human behaviour in his works. Of course, Shakespeare is not for everyone. Regarding film versions of his plays, I strongly recommend Sir Laurence Olivier's three self-directed Shakespeare films (\\"Henry V,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Richard III\\"), Kenneth Branagh's growing output of Shakespeare (\\"Henry V,\\" \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Love's Labour's Lost\\") and faithful stage versions of Shakespeare (The Merchant Of Venice [an out-of-print film starring Laurence Olivier and directed by Jonathan Miller], \\"King Lear\\" [starring Laurence Olivier and filmed as a movie in 1984], \\"Othello\\" [starring Laurence Olivier and filmed as a movie in 1965]). I also recommend Oliver Parker's 1995 version of<br />\\"Othello,\\" starring Kenneth Branagh as the villainous Iago and Franco Zefferelli's 1968 version of \\"Romeo & Juliet,\\" as well as West Side Story,\\" a classic musical featuring music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim (in his debut; he would eventually write \\"Sweeny Todd\\") and masterful choreography by Jerome Robbins (he choreographed the dance sequences in \\"The King & I,\\" \\"Fiddler On The Roof\\") which uses the tragic storyline of the play in a modern setting without the dialogue (unlike that idiot Luhrman, who had the c----es to COMPLETELY MODERNIZE the play; \\"West Side Story\\" and \\"Love's Labour's Lost\\" is as far as you can get to modernizing Shakespeare, the God of playwrights).<br /><br />His plays, poems and sonnets are rated PG for some violence (\\"Titus Andronicus,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet\\") and mild vulgarity (sexual references gracefully obscured in Elizabethan English; \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" \\"Othello,\\" \\"King Lear,\\" \\"Venus & Adonis,\\" \\"The Rape Of Lucrece,\\" etc; though the language of his time was bawdy, Shakespeare DID NOT condone sexual licence). Profanity was also non-existent at the time. He used the words (\\"Damn,\\" \\"Hell,\\" \\"A--,\\" and \\"B----\\" [once; in \\"King Lear\\"]) in their original definitions. Hell, as a place of torment, damn as in eternal banishment from God, a-- as in the animal also called a donkey and b---- as a female dog. Used improperly, these words immediately become insults of the most vulgar kind.in Elizabethan English; \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" \\"Othello,\\" \\"King Lear,\\" \\"Venus & Adonis,\\" \\"The Rape Of Lucrece,\\" etc; though the language of his time was bawdy, Shakespeare DID NOT condone sexual licence).

0440214041|4.0|Having read most of Grisham's books, I've saved a few of his \\"best\\" for last.  While it wasn't a 5 star book like I'd hoped, it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one.<br /><br />Having saw the movie years ago, I had a good idea of what the book was about:  Two Supreme Court Justices are killed, a law school student, along with many other people become curious and try to figure out \\"who dun it\\"...only, she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head, and when the wrong people find out, she's on the run for her life!<br /><br />I enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast-paced, and had a lot of detail.  So much detail and characters, I had a bit of a struggle to keep up!  Of course it was suspenseful and the characters, especially of Darby, the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth.  Good read!

0345440900|4.0|This is one of the better books I've read, which offers advice to new parents.  Certainly helped us much more than \\"Happiest Baby on the Block\\"!  Although, when reading, like one reviewer said, take it with a grain of salt!<br /><br />I read this book cover to cover in 3 days and quite enjoyed it, which is rare for a sort of self-help type book.  A lot of the information I found interesting, a lot I found thought-provoking, some I found helpful, some I found made no sense to me and I ignored those parts.<br /><br />Basically this book goes over \\"EASY\\"- Tracy's guide to newborns.  E is for eating, A for activity, S for sleep and Y for you.  She goes over each area in much detail, as the book is 300+ pages.  Ideally, if you could have the perfect baby who would always follow your lead, this book might work like a charm.  However, babies are all different and I know from my own that setting a strict routine just wouldn't work (I've tried).  But, I have managed a slight routine for us, as he's only 2 months, although I had that going before I read the book.<br /><br />Here's what I liked and disliked about the book: It reminds us that babies are \\"people\\" too, although I dont' think we need to take it as far as explaining every little thing to them, like asking for their permission to be picked up.  I liked that it reminded me to not get the baby in a routine that we don't want to keep- ie sleeping in our bed every night.  I liked that it gave examples of how to figure out what the baby is asking for- ie if he's tired, hungry, needs to be burped etc.  There's actually a long list of signs- like if his head is nodding from side to side he's sleepy or if his tongue is curling up he has gas or pain.  However, this part you can't trust 100%.  My baby- would exhibit 3 signs, all pointing to different causes!!!  I was confused more than ever!!  There was also a list that described cries to tell what the baby needs, but I didn't find this helpful either.  But believe me, I wish I did- I wish my baby was the perfect \\"textbook\\" according to her and her lists were right on- how simple and wonderful that would be!<br /><br />There were a lot of important things pointed out though, pit-falls that parents can fall into without realizing.  For instance, I know even myself as a new mom, first you get used to the fact that when he cries he wants to eat, but as he gets older, I needed to remember that perhaps it isn't always hunger.  I also found the sleeping chapter helpful, and am currently using it to help get my little one into a better sleep pattern.  It's not working miracles, like the book claims, but it is helpful and I'm hoping that soon it will be smooth sailing.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this book, but I'd caution people that it's just not the be-all, end-all answer.  I do like the tone of the book though, it makes me want to invite Tracy into my home and help with my little one because I do think a lot of what she says makes sense and is worthwhile.me, I wish I did- I wish my baby was the perfect \\"textbook\\" according to her and her lists were right on- how simple and wonderful that would be!    <br /> <br />There were a lot of important things pointed out though, pit-falls that parents can fall into without realizing.

B00006ADFL|1.0|I bought this movie soley because it was a \\"Peter Jackson\\".<br /><br />While I found it intersesting and well filmed, it's not a movie that I will ever bother watching again. The limitation of this movie is, that it's a true story. The sureal lives of the characters are well portrayed, but the conclusion is abrupt and, while not graphic, is still sickening, especially when you know that people can behave like that and be out of prison within five years! If it was a work of fiction, maybe the girls would have been hanged and therefore given the viewer a sense of satisfaction. But, as they say, truth is stranger than fiction.
0684803356|5.0|It is a fascinating tale of Robert (Roberto) Jordon and his paisonos, caught up in the Spanish Civil War. The story covers only three days of the war, yet it takes us on Robert Jordon's life voyage. It is conveyed by the brilliant soliloquy, a tug of war of conscience, duty, honor and death itself.  Who among us has not had such dialogue?<br /><br /> It has everything, romance, camaraderie, bravery, cowardice, and above all sacrifice. Jordon, an American, who is addressed as \\"Ingles\\" by his comrades, is the band's leader, who is commissioned by the rebellion general to blow up a bridge.<br /><br />His team includes some unforgettable characters ever penned, the ruthless yet pragmatic Pablo, his incredibly humane wife, Pilar, Augustine, brave soldier, like a brother to Robert, and lovely, innocent Maria. Roberto (Jordon) and Maria fall in love the moment they meet and once Pilar reads his palm, the denouement is never in doubt.<br /><br />The scene where Pablo is in charge with a gun hustling out town's fascists who are holed up in the church,  to be \\"taken care\\" of  by the avenging mob outside  is reminiscent of \\"krystalnacht\\" enactment superbly portrayed by G&uuml;nter Grass in his classic Nazi drama\\" Tin Drum\\".<br /><br />An all time classic
B000929AJQ|4.0|Nine Inch Nails' latest full length album is not the masterpiece their acclaimed \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was, but it definitely does NOT disappoint.  Although it's odd to see this dark & heavy band use the word \\"love\\" in their song titles, don't worry, they haven't gone soft.<br /><br />The first track, \\"All the Love in the World\\" is not typical NIN.  Which is excellent.  \\"...hiding in the crowd I'm all alone...\\" Reznor laments, singing with his deep, thick voice while the music swells orchestrally.  The song eventually builds into a percussion filled loud crescendo that just tempts you to keep going from one tune to another.<br /><br />\\"The Hand That Feeds\\" and \\"Only\\" are fast favorites, but you cannot overlook the title track, \\"With Teeth\\", which goes from loud to soft in the blink of an eye.  Reznor seems to say under his breath, \\"I cannot go through this again\\" which brings to mind retrospective thoughts about his past depression, drug use, and writer's block.<br /><br />Other tracks to take notice of are \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\", and \\"Beside You in Time\\".

That took it a little bit far for me, but otherwise, I think she did a great job, and it's a travesty that she didn't continue on to that second album, because based on what we heard from the double-sided single, it was something really worth looking forward to.

0684803356|5.0|This is Hemingway's virtual personal account of the Spanish Civil War at the ground level. The central character is an American from Montana who speaks fluent Spanish and is known as the \\"dynamiter\\". He sides with the republicans, as did other Americans such as the Lincoln Brigade and many other westerners and soviets  pitted against the Fascists supported by the Nazis and Italians. The American, referred to as Roberto or Ingles by the guerilla band,  joins the band behind enemy lines  with the expressed purpose of blowing up a bridge to coincide with a republican offensive. The brutality of war is evident by Maria, with the band, who was brutalized and raped while her parents were shot just because they were republicans. In contrast, demonstrating that war is brutal on both sides, Pablo, the band's soddened leader, is traumatized with guilt and feelings of defeat that haunt him with own past butchering of townsmen that were friendly to the Fascists. There is a general feeling of despair as the band attempts to regenerate itself to action in the face of an enemy well supported by aircraft and weaponry. Another key character is Pablo's lady friend Pilar who, once associated with a famous bull fighter, speaks often of manliness and she takes over the leadership temporarily vacated by Pablo's morose fall into a drunken stupor. The discussion of Spanish views of manhood provide an opportunity for Hemingway to expose his fascination with bull fighting and machismo that is both courageous and revolting. Time is fleeting, although the paperback is almost 470 pages, within in the book as an accelerated romance develops between Roberto and Marie that heightens an expectation of loss as the two fall deeply in love. Hemingway consumes the bulk of the book with dialogue within the personalities in the band such as the gypsy and the old man who seems the most dependable and balanced member. Action picks up toward the end of the book as  Pablo's band prepares to take action while the Fascists search the mountains for Pablo's associate and his band on a neighboring mountain. As Roberto and Pablo's band seek to destroy the bridge, the republican attack formes in the distance. There is an expectation of great loss and the book climaxes with the attack on the bridge and you feel an uncertainness of doom for the central characters as the end is abrupt and almost shocking. The book is a classic and very realistic, it may be too long for younger readers but it certainly outlines the tragedies of war and perhaps underlines the horror of Civil War.

B000274THQ|4.0|I had missed this movie while it was in the theaters. It was praised highly in a book about the history of post-WW2 Europe and I decided to buy it to watch it. <br />   It is set in East-Germany. A mother, a convinced communist, whose husband has fled to West Germany, has a heart attack and falls into a coma when her son is arrested by the Stasi Eastern police. While she is in the coma, the communist government collapses and the Wall is taken down. As she slowly recovers from the coma, her physician advices her son, that any excitement could kill her. So, her son, together with some friends, decides to fake for her the continuation of the communist government on TV. But the real world interferes, when, for example,  a huge Coca-Cola poster appears on a building across the street. The movie is, on occasion, very funny. In German with English subtitles. <br />

B000007U6V|5.0|Some of this is quite pretty - - \\"Kometenmelodie 2\\", in fact, waxes practically majestic.  And it's true:  the title track glides along with four wheels off the ground for 22 minutes or so.  And the recorder piece that closes the album (replete with little birdies twittering all over the place) is a bit of a pleasant and unexpected surprise; \\"Morgenspaziergang\\", after all, translates as \\"A Morning Walk\\".  Not quite of its time, and slightly before it, you have a bona fide classic here.  Fah'n on.
B00005JNS0|5.0|i'm a grown adult but i have to say i really liked this film. it was nice, taught a story about sacrifice, and a little appreciation of route 66.  i actually went on it two months ago and what a gorgeous view.  we often forget what we have in this country, this dvd brings it in a cartoonish way.
B000001DVD|4.0|When you first hear this record you say-\\"wow, who got a hold of these guys?\\"---Excellent album. Great song writing accented by the production work of Mutt Lange. This album probably kicked off Mutt's long producing career, along with AC/DC's back in black. The layered vocals are top notch along with the guitar work of Clark and Willis. ( Willis was soon after replaced). I find Leppard albums after this \\"over produced\\". On this album they still have a touch of the sound from the first album. Highlights include \\"Bring' on the Heartbreak\\" bleeding into \\"Switch 625\\"-Let it Go-and the title track. If ya like Def Leppard at all, ya gotta have it.
B000H7JCG4|2.0|They need to get the rights for the music because it is killing the series.  The music they have on the dvd season one is so corny.  I miss all those great songs that went with the drama of the show.  If they don't rectify this problem before season two comes out, I will not be buying it.  Season one is a waste of money without the right music. Hopefully, they re-release it with the right soundtrtack.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!
B000GPIPD8|5.0|I don't want to like this band, or this album, as much as I do.  It bugs me a little bit that they won't add a bassist so Auerbach can rip some screeching blues solos full of passion and heartache.  I can sense that he wants to let loose on this record more than any of their others - but can't because of the restrictions that their 2 person set up inevitably will always bring.  All that having been said, this record is nothing short of amazing.  I've only had it for a few days and I can't stop listening to it.  This is far and away the Black Keys' strongest record to date.  The singing on this record captures the blues more than any white rock band I have ever heard - from Zeppelin to Stevie Ray Vaughn and ZZ Top and the rest.  Mr. Auerbach was blessed with a voice that came straight from the murkiest waters of the Mississippi Delta.  Listening to the Black Keys - especially on this record - is like being transported to a time and place that is long gone.  They make the blues exciting and invigorating again.  This does not sound like a white blues-rock band.  Magic Potion is fuzzed-out heart-wrenching pure blues from start to finish.  It is one of the most urgent, honest, emotional records I have heard in some time.  The riffs are brutal yet silky smooth, and Dan Carney's drums hit hard throughout.  As for the singing, I think Dan Auerbach has the best voice in music today.  I'll refrain from an exhaustive discussion of the individual songs.  Suffice it to say there is not one remotely weak track on this disc.  The songs are so strong you'll scarely notice the stripped down minimalism of the Black Keys' sound.  With this release the Black Keys have gone from the best indie novelty act around to a full-blown rock and roll powerhouse.  If they added some more members (or just a bassist - come on Dan we want to hear some jamming!) and thickened up their sound without losing that garage rock edge, I really feel this band could be rock and roll superstars, one of the great groups of this generation (these guys are so much better than Wolfmother, who I like also).  With Magic Potion they are well on their way.
0618680004|4.0|In 1989 Dawkins wrote : \\"Faith is such a successful brainwasher in its own favour, especially a brainwasher of children, that it is hard to break its hold. But what, after all, is faith? It is a state of mind that leads people to believe something - it does not matter what - in the total absence of supporting evidence. If there were good supporting evidence then faith would be superfluous, for the evidence would compel us to believe anyway.\\" <br /> <br />In the God Delusion, Dawkins should have asked the faithful the following question : \\"What evidence would make you disbelieve?\\" In all likelihood the honest reply would be : \\"No evidence can make me disbelieve. Do not forget, I believe !\\"  <br /> <br />No matter the sophistication of the believer-unbeliever debate, in the end, it always boils down to reason wrestling with the tautology of faith. Dawkins makes that point abundantly clear.  <br /> <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|Beautiful production, great casting, reasonable faithfulness to the book, and, let's face it, Colin Firth is worth the purchase price alone.  He will forever be Mr. Darcy, to me!
B00004R9A4|5.0|I vaguely remember seeing this in the theatre when I was a kid.  Like a door opening in my mind, the flood of memories come back to me.  It reminds me of a time when there was no Harry Potter and we used our imagination to look past the mock up of special effects and what have you.  All in all the story is good and entertaining.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|Rocky is a great movie.  I'm looking forward to seeing all the extras on this edition.  I don't mind that they're upgrading to a 2 disc edition.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Great flick with plenty of special effects and great audio and it even has the semblance of a plot. Politicians, watch out!
B000FIMG68|5.0|Season 2 of Lost is definetly a \\"must have\\" if you were hooked after season 1. The plot continues to thicken, and as the characters continue to unravel their stories, one becomes obsessed with what is going to happen next. An exciting, intriguing watch which leaves you for the need for more !! Can't wait for season 3 !!
B000B2YQX4|3.0|I am not the fan of Depeche Mode. As far it concerns me, they had couple of  good songs and that about covers it. I don't exactly know how I came to possess this particular CD but some way or the other I have it and I listened to it for a couple of days now, almost without pause.<br /><br />I cannot say what, but I lack something from this album. It is incredibly moody and dark. It has some kind of glamour in its songs, yet I feel like artists is constantly trying to say something but he fails in doing so. Why does he fails I cannot say. It seems to me that even he does not know what he tries to communicate.<br /><br />Yet, songs are catchy, and once heard they enter ones mind, and you find yourself humming them all day long. That is also some kind of problem. This wasn't supposed to be catchy. It wasn't supposed to be pop. But somehow it manages to be it, and in just that manner this album fails.<br /><br />Or maybe failure is too strong a word. This album aimed to high. Unfortunately it didn't reached it mark.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|Mastodon is one of the few bands truly worthy of the hype bestowed upon them and let the gushing continue, these guys are definately the most genre defying outfit in metal today.  So what do you do after you have created an album highly acclaimed by both critics and fans, well when you are Mastodon you release a record even heavier, catchier, more progressive and even better than the predecessor. <br /> <br />Nothing needs to be written about the musical prowess that these gentlemen posess.  You can read a bunch of reviews below mine that can better describe the sound and skill displayed by Mastodon, and I agree whole heartitly that these guys are definately a force to be reckoned with.  One thing that really stood out to me was how cool the whole story line is, on the outside cover it is easily interpreted as a metaphor that anyone can relate to, a massive life obstacle that you will either conquor or it will conquor you.  But the meat of the story per the band is of a man whose objective is to free man's current \\"reptilian brain\\" (i.e. the sleep, eat, screw, destroy way of thinking) by transporting the Crystal Skull up to the top of Blood Mountain and inserting it into his own mind, and thus opening up a whole new way of free thinking upon mankind.  Now, that's quite a long stretch from the average satan, evil, death, struggle type lyrical concepts that make up a good majority of the metal world.  Also along the way the man must encounter and overcome a world full of mythical beasts, such as a Psychic Cyclops, a Colony of Birchmen who form a large tree like beast when being attacked, and all other types of fun stuff.  VERY COOL STUFF!!!!  Although you probably wouldn't know it by reading the lyrics, so I am glad that I checked out that article.   <br /> <br />All that being said the story wouldn't be half as great if the music sucked and well it doesn't, it rules, plain and simple.  The trip that Mastodon takes you on is one for the ages, full of plodding heaviness, dizzying complexities, and Pink Floyd like spaciness that is never predictable and always interesting.  I would say that Sleeping Giant, Carpillarian Crest, and Circle Cysquatch are all among my favorite tracks this band has ever recorded, but there is never a dull moment on this record.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is by far my favorite album these guys have put out so far and as much as I love Slayer and Lamb of God, I think Mastodon has released the best metal record of the year (death metal record goes to Suffocation).  I would suggest this to anyone with an ear for heavy music, and even if you are just into trippy sh#t this still might be up your alley.  Buy without hesitation, welcome to Blood Mountain.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|No matter your taste in music there will be at least 1 or more tracks on this CD that will open your eyes and give you that little jolt up your spine that comes when you find something truly special.  My Chemical Romance has out done all expectations of mine.  I enjoyed Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, but I could never have thought this follow up would be anything like it is. I was  blown out of my own mind.<br /><br />Seems the band have borrowed from just about every genera you can think of.<br /><br />Opera, Bar room, Heavey Metal, Classic Rock, Jazz, Broadway, you name it, it's here. This album has so many different styles of music I haven't been this excited about an album since I first heard Freddie Mercury as a child, I was brought to tears on atleast 4 tracks.  I am yet to find just one I love above all else.  I agree with some of the other reviewers on the songs though.  Mama is awesome, I don't want to give you any presumptions on how the songs play out, you need to listen for yourself.  Teenagers is another one I even love the short yet funny as hell Blood the hidden track at the end of the album...  There is so muchwonder and magic about this album...  I feel this is an album everyone should have a copy of, for the moment this is one of this generations Pink Floyds the Wall/Queen - Any album-(cause they were all good)  This is pure entertainment...  They have made a fan for life with this album.
B00005JPC7|1.0|This movie is revolting and an insult to the human race.  Spend your money on your favorite worthy cause.  <br /> <br />IF I had paid to see it, (I saw in on a complimentary pass to drum up hype) I would have asked for my money back.  It was simply the most revolting and insulting movie I've seen in my life.  I kept waiting for it to have purpose.  No joy...   I seriously wish I had walked out and gotten that wasted two hours back in my life. <br /> <br />I'm truly saddened by the reviews that think this is film is funny in the face of humans across the world trying to understand each other and to get along without annihilating one another.  I'm also disheartened by SO much money being spent to view this piece of trash, when there are so many worthy \\"sparklers\\" of entertainment that deserve support and go unnoticed.   Likewise it would be nice to see the millions being spent attending this movie on battling the prejudices used as the butts of the attempts at humor. <br /> <br />PLEASE do not support this type of stupidity with your cash, even in the spirit of morbid curiosity. <br /> <br />BTW, I am NOT a prude, and enjoy an off-color joke or even corny joke as much as the next guy, but nonstop insults to intelligence, does not constitute entertainment for me.  Heck I even like Animal House and Airplane...
B00005RDRO|4.0|This is a movie that my mother took me and my siblings to when it first came out.  I remember loving the title and thinking it would be really scary since it was about murder and death.  What I remember most about it is Maggie Smith saying, \\"Dickie!  Where's my Dickie?!\\" I bought it for sentimental reasons.  It's a really great movie, if only for all the stars that appear.  It's also got Truman Capote, who is strange and wonderful.  It's got lots of twists and turn.  The introduction is a little long - the piece where everyone arrives at the mansion.  It's a little gimicky, but it's Neil Simon, so that's to be expected.  Would I recommend it to others?  Sure.  Was I a tiny bit disappointed that it was not as wonderful as I remember it?  Sure.  The last thirty years made it a little better in my mind than it actually is.  It's got some good extras, but not as many as I generally like.  But it's a good nostalgia pick and there are some great performances.
B000FIMG68|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first season set. However, this set is so darned dark all the time.If the director is attempting to attain film noir status, he/she is successful. Half of the scenes shown are totally black, and one must strain the eyes to see anything but darkness. <br /> <br />The characters are well written with Sawyer being the kind of fellow you do not want your son to emulate. Michelle Rodriguez' character is intense, tough, and the kind of person I'd want backing me up in combat. <br /> <br />Hurley's bulk makes him almost disgusting to watch albeit the actor does a great job of playing a heavyweight sumo wrestler. With all the mysterious and beneficial powers inherent to the island, I wonder why the island has not cured his obesity? <br /> <br />I probably will not order Season 3 when it comes out on DVD.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Almost wet my pants. Disney at their best. Who was real and who was the cartoon? I'm in love with Jessica Rabbit, hubba-hubba. <br />A lot of women should be drawn that way, might be a better world for all of us, PLLLEEEAAASSSEEE !!
0800141660|5.0|Actually I had this movie before on VHS so I have seen it numerous times, but I wanted to own it on DVD. <br />It is just one of my favorite films. Touching, has humor, well acted, great cast. Wonderful story about the <br />power of love and patience.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|based on the complex story line of the final fantasy 7 role playing game, this movie pics up from a few years after the game ends.   <br />in terms of visuals, this movie is awesome.  this movie pushes the boundries of \\"fantasy\\" to the limits-the characters are beautiful, the scenes are breath taking, and the battle scenes properly incorporate all aspects of physics, but at the same time is continually breaking every single law.  unbelievably beautiful.  from the single drop of water, to the dematerilization of the body, this movie doesn't disappoint. <br />as for the story line, i'm all about the inner termoil.  and of course, this story revolves around mr. blond haired dude who's all about that.  but it's an interesting resolution as he realizes not every battle is won with skill, strength, and determination. <br />this movie was worth every penny for me-but then again, i'm a sci-fi loving kind of guy who has a love for the ff games of the past (i stopped playing at ff10). <br />i appreciated every aspect of the movie, especially the very few tidbits that were taken from the games and cleverly incorporated to the game. <br />and as for the characters, everyone's back.  and although i wished certain characters were in the movie longer, i think that purposely limiting their presence in the movie brought a lot more weight to them for when they appeared.   <br />and the japanese-style thug humor?  very funny.  although certain parts illustrate cultural differences that an american would not typically understand, if you observe their actions, i think it offers a tidbit of insight to the traditional japanese sempai/kohai relationship.  (but that stuff was minor) <br />only bad point i can think of was that some of the scenes were too fast.  i mean, crap, it was like you were following a bullet in real time.  sheesh.  i mean, i like action, but when it happens, i'd like to actually have it register in my brain before jumping to the next sequence.  (but i have to admit, there's no time to complain about it-if you do, you miss the next thing, which they slow down....lol)  i guess they didn't want to play-out the slow motion thing.  (that made me appreciate those sequences even more). <br />so all in all, it was a great movie.  although i'm biased for playing every single ff game until ff10, and for being a huge sci-fi fan, i'd have to say that if you appreciate art, you would appreciate this film (if not for the story) for what the makers were able to do with cgi.  and honestly, i think this movie did a great job of blurring the lines between reality (as in physics) and fantasy (characters, storyline, and fantastic action sequences). <br />hope this helps-
B000031XCR|5.0|I love this CD I had one and played it and loaned it out and it got damaged so this one is a replacement because I love it so much.
B0006Z2LH4|2.0|\\"Cube Zero\\" mearly satisfied my curiousity about what existed outside the CUBE but still leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  Perhaps \\"CUBE 4\\" will  answer these questions...someday. Try renting it first.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This collection is terrific, both from an artistic standpoint but also from a reality standpoint.  Many people, myself included, have no idea what war was or is like.  This collection brings to light just how difficult these times were and the sacrfices all these brave young men (and women) gave.  It also paints a very realistic picture of what Europe was like during the timeframe and the atrocities that happened there.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I liked this version of the Titanic story when I saw it on the big screen, and I've seen all of them except a silent reel made shortly after the sinking in 1912. I've been a Titanic buff for 50 years now, and read most of the books. However, last weekend I went to a museum to see \\"Artifacts of the Titanic\\", a collection of more than 100 items snatched up from the debris field two-and-a-half miles down, things once connected to the White Star Line or to individual passengers which survived 80-plus years underwater. It was incredibly moving and sad. Connected with the exhibit was an IMAX showing of James Cameron's \\"Ghosts of the Abyss.\\" The \\"Titanic\\" director took some of his enormous profits from this 1998 release, and in 2001 he rented a Russian ship, two submersible submarines, and two robotic cameras, and went down to the wreck himself, taking along actor Bill Paxton from the movie. The resulting hour-long giant screen film is excellent. If you get a chance to see it, or the salvaged items, don't pass it up. Meanwhile, the movie works. So have most of the earlier versions, and so have most of the books, because the tragedy speaks to people of all ages and classes. The fictional parts of Cameron's film work better than the fictional parts of earlier movies about the disaster, in my view. Seeing the artifacts and the wreck on a 58-foot curved screen made me want to see this movie again, on a big screen.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost is pretty much the perfect television show...it always keeps you on the edge of your seat, it always keeps you thinking about what could be next. Like I said before, it's the perfect television show, and if you haven't seen season 1, get it, watch it, then get season 2, watch it, love it. Like most Lost fans say \\"It's not obsession, it's dedication.\\"
B0000C3I6U|4.0|Excellent! Inspirational! Filmed at a time when Body Building was about proportions as well as size. Arnold was undoubtedly the King of Body Building because he matched size with PERFECT proportions.These days it seems size is the only criteria, and as a result bodies are grotesque.I had the movie on videotape, but the revised copy on DVD is vastly superior......................Boyd Clifton.
B000GRTQSE|1.0|I grew up listening to Bob Dylan, and was really looking foward to his <br />his new DVD, Modern Times, and was really disgusted when i tried the bonus <br />DVD in two dvd players i have,and lent it to a friend to try,and neither <br />one of us could get it to play.I should have returned it,but after my friend tried and failed to get it to play,as stated,i was just disgusted. <br />I desided not to order any more music DVDs from Amazon.I must say that the  <br />music on the first DVD was great,starting with Thunder On The Mountain,it <br />was good to listen to some new Dylan. <br />
B000FQ4M58|5.0|This album is simply awesome. Awesome in the true sense of that much overused word. Great music, powerful lyrics, soaring vocals. Meat Loaf's voice can reach out and grab you in a vice-like grip that you can't escape. He'll make you smile, cheer, and cry. Just compare his version of It's All Coming Back To Me Now to Celine Dion's. Her's is good, a lot of vocal power, but it has no emotional power compared to this one. This one pulls you in, makes you feel the loss, the longing. That's real power.  <br /> <br />Get the album. You won't regret it.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|....this is probably the closest we'll ever get to the days of Collinwood, Barnabas, and Quentin Collins. Unlike the \\"Dark Shadows\\" back in the day, \\"Supernatural\\" has one single unifying plot theme---the joint search for a missing father and the killer of the boys' mother. But it is the chemistry between the brothers that keeps me entranced. The older operates on gut instinct, and is quicker to have a physical response. The younger, who has left college to join his older brother, is more intuitive and thoughtful. And what a wicked, referential sense of humor the script has! Referencing everything from Orville Redenbacher to the film \\"Deliverance,\\" it's a treat for TV and movie trivia buffs. But let's get to the real point: the show, in its first season, was frequently, and let me go ahead and say it, MORE FREQUENTLY than most so called cinematic \\"horror\\" films, flat out SCARY. Gave me goosebumps on several occasions. Well acted, well produced, well scripted....it's an all-round winner, and a keeper.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|This is one of the best shows around these days...good family entertainment without all the sexy and bad language that is common thesedays....
B000FIMG68|4.0|With the additional cast members, the story was in danger of becoming even more convoluted and for a while, it seemed that would be so. But my biggest, and eventually only, issue with Season Two was Michele Rodriguez' character, Ana-Lucia. Shrewish in the extreme, she was not even a fun-to-hate character, as Sawyer often is. I hated her, period, and wanted her storyline to resolve itself much sooner than it did. However, the series mainstay characters saved the day. Locke is probably the most enigmatic character, and he remained so, thanks to the superbly nuanced performance of Terry Quinn. The scenes with Jack and his wife-to-be in the hospital following her surgery will rank long in my memory as among the finest of TV acting I've ever seen. Those moments make Season Two all the more worthwhile, and though I maintained zero empathy for Rodriguez Ana-Lucia through until the end, in nearly every other way, I was riveted. Bravo!
0679731725|5.0|one of the best books that I have ever read, frome perhaps the best living author
B00005AWMF|4.0|If you don't have Sade's \\"Diamond Life\\" or even if you do, this \\"Best of\\" <br />CD is a welcome addition to any music collection. This unique singer continues to haunt me like the girl from Ipanema.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This CD is absolutely fabulous.  I bought it after hearing one or two songs off the CD and deciding that Jack Black is one of the funniest humans alive. This is a must own CD - a great look into Jack Black's filthier side :)
B000I5X81K|5.0|Great CD, worth the money!!  Favorite:  February Song!!! Wonderful.
6305882592|5.0|Love story meets dark comedy.  Cameron Diaz said it best in \\"There's Something About Mary\\" - Harold and Maude is the greatest love story of all time.  The story is great, the humor priceless, and the soundtrack is fabulous!

B0002OERI0|5.0|A terrific blend of thoughtful ballads and hard-hitting rock, this is a CD you can listen to over and over.
B00020HEL6|5.0|For somebody who is starting to get into Jazz like I am, this is a very easy listening, enjoyable vocal/jazz CD to have.  I believe this one will be one of your favorites, and definitely belongs in your CD collection.  The more I listen to it, the more I like the musical arrangement, the voice of Renee, and if you are an audiophile, it's an extra treat to get all the detail that was recorded on this CD.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Actually, I'd give this CD 4.5 stars.  I don't consider myself a diehard Chili Peppers fan.  The only other Peppers CD I own is their greatest hits (purists disdain most \\"hits\\" compilations).  Forgive me, but some of their hip hop music is hard for us ancient ones to handle in large doses.  But much of their music appeals to a broad spectrum of music afficionados.  They are one of the few contemporary groups that my friend's teenage sons and I agree on...and I'm pushing 60. <br /> <br />I'd read other reviews that touted Stadium Arcadium as one of their best.  I'd add my name to that list.  There's not a stinker in the bunch...and this is a 2-CD set.  I'm not sure the teenagers would agree.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The product came in a timely manner.  Worked great.  We listen to it all the time.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Season 2 begins with an element viewers will be familiar with from the previous season, but who is this new character and what is this strange place he's in. The hatch itself could have been enough to keep viewers on the edge of their seats, but then we start to learn more about Charlie and his Heroin-Addicted Brother. Mr. Echo and his dark past. Plus the Others lurking in the shadows with their spies fool the Tailles and our main group.  <br />   The one overall reason to have this entire series on DVD also hinges on the quality of the picture. Even an HDTV broadcast of the show on Wednesday night pales in comparison to the flawless production on DVD.  <br />   I have lent out the two seasons a few times to folks at work and for some strange reason they all seem to call in sick for a few days. Upon their return, with dark circle under their eyes; they speak only of LOST and the survivors they have bonded with. <br /> <br />
0679746048|3.0|<br />Usually the cliché is along the lines of, \\"The book is much better the movie.\\"  Well folks, there are always exceptions to the rule.  What did the Hollywood suits see in the memoir, \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" by Susanna Kaysen, to believe there was enough material for a full-length movie?   Angelina Jolie's Oscar-winning performance (Best Supporting Actress) as the sociopath Lisa Rowe pops and sparkles like a roman candle (this is before marrying and divorcing Bob Thornton, before becoming a UNHCR goodwill ambassador, before becoming everyday tabloid fodder, before \\"Brangelina,\\" ah, you get the idea).  However, the plot focus is on Winona Ryder who plays the dour, scared-of-life, young adult, wide-eyed author, Kaysen, who has been labeled with borderline personality disorder.   The memoir focuses mainly on the 18 months spent at the ivy league of mental hospitals, McLean Hospital (some of the clientele have included Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, James Taylor and Ray Charles) during the tumultuous late 1960s when both Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated. <br /> <br />Kaysen's writing is taut, quite bony at times, so much so that one may still feel hungry after finishing this quick read.  Perhaps it is the lack of a continuous narrative arc.  Kaysen's memoir jumps around haphazardly in short chapters from the present to the traumatic past without any closure for either time period.  Maybe the ennui stems from the feeling of being cheated out of information; this is a memoir after all, so show me the horror.  Eighteen months of being locked up, drugged, isolated, and the reader is afforded only 168 pages, which includes copies of actual notes and letters from her case (at times the quality of the copy is just too difficult to read).  Surely there must have been more worthy anecdotes the author could have culled from her extended stay.  If not, then why not privy the reader to the author's life before the hospitalization or share more of her life after being discharged.  There are some tidbits about Kaysen's life before and after McLean, but only enough to further frustrate the reader's sensibilities. <br />   <br />\\"Girl, Interrupted\\" is a perfect starting point for those foreign to the world of mental illness.  But if you are looking for a more meaty choice, then you best go elsewhere for your fill.   This memoir is to be shelved as an appetizer read.   For a dense full meal, linger over the classic, \\"The Bell Jar,\\" by Sylvia Plath. <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B0009SOFGI|4.0|Now I know why my Mom wouldn't allow my brother to buy this album way back in '69...it was TOO COOL and hip and WAY ahead of it's time. Even today, this album sounds relevant. Long live Iggy Pop!!
B000FIMG68|5.0|I am a big Lost fan. I didn't see the first season until I bought it on dvd. I was hooked!!! By the time I watched it, the second season was already started!!! So I had to wait to get the second season on dvd. We watched it in less than a week! It is so cool. It sucks you into all the stories. You are craving more at the end of each episode! Definitely a 5 star show!!!
0767819659|5.0|My daughter, who is 3 1/2, loves this movie. Moreover, it is fun for adults to watch too.  The acting is super, the charters amusing, and young Madeline is so spunky!  If your child loves the Madeline books, she/he will adore this movie even more!
0767847431|5.0|The Golden Voyage of Sinbad is a great adventure movie for the whole family.  The special effects by Ray Harrhousen are terrffic!  Tom Baker (Doctor Who) is great as the evil magician.
B000GYI32M|4.0|I can't understand all the complaints about Season 3.  Yes, it's not quite as good as the first two seasons, but to me, Season 3 is more like a case of the show \\"being good enough to tune in every week\\".  Nothing really memorable happens until the very end, but the characters maintain their interesting way of going through life and school, in my opinion.   <br /> <br />So in the end, I was glad I tuned in to Season 3 every week because I ended up liking everything that was happening.  Don't be fooled by the reviews- it's not a bad season, it's just not as good as it could have been.  If you liked Seasons 1 and 2, you should look into it.

0876852630|4.0|Bukowski has great images of the downtrodden and the lowlife but he offers little in the way of anecdotes for inhumanity except maybe drinking and bumming. After awhile one gets the feeling that being a victim is his excuse for affirming authenticity. Of course writing for him is a salvation though after awhile all these biographies of the down and out read the same. He gives some great graphic depictions of alcoholism but to me this doesn't equate with greatness in and of itself. I would add that full blown alcoholism is much worse for suffering than bukowski depicts. It is not some bohemian romance to see the end result of dependence as i do in healthcare. However, I think bukowski conveys quite chillingly the inhumanity that helps drive people to it.
0823023494|5.0|This book is amazing. It tells you how to create your characters from scratch. How to develop your character's personality by knowing the plot he's in, among other stuf... Really great.
B000059TPN|5.0|This is a great movie. You sense a lot of sarcasm and cockiness throughout the movie which makes it even more enjoyable. Moments like when Sean Connery comes strolling out saying he's always the one left to the enemy. I watched this movie 5 nights in a row and I laughed and tensed up at the same places every time. This is just an overall good movie. It can get a little gory at times, but nonetheless, a great movie to add to your collection.
0156030322|4.0|What does it take to make a man a murderer? Driver has been living a double life for years--to society, he's a professional stunt driver for the movie industry. But on the underground, he mans the getaway car for crooks fleeing the scene of a crime. All he was supposed to do was drive--he wasn't supposed to know the details. He wasn't expected to get involved. But when Driver is caught in the middle of a robbery gone terribly wrong, he is thrown into a dark world of crime, deception, and revenge. Kill or be killed--the only law of the road. <br /> <br />James Sallis' Drive presents an interesting and colorful reading experience. On the surface it merely appears to be a dark tale of crime and revenge, but underneath all the lawlessness, the author addresses much deeper topics. Most of the characters that Driver encounters are those in the lower class whose only crime was to be born in the wrong place at the wrong time. Along with Driver, the reader is led to wonder throughout the course of the novel, can a man rise above the circumstances of his birth? Once a man has taken a step toward a life of crime, can he ever turn back? <br /> <br />Though violent, Drive is not explicitly gory. It is gritty, but not vulgar. The story is marked by a surprising amount of pathos. The deaths of everyone he cares about leaves Driver rootless. He has recurring dreams of seeking after beauty--reaching for hope--that always end before he finds fulfillment. The events in the story unfold like a Greek tragedy--things could have turned out differently if only the characters had made better choices. <br /> <br />Any reader that feels up to the challenge is welcome to check out the novel. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Drive is a complex and thought-provoking novel that challenges its readers to examine their own stand on morality.

0385338694|4.0|The author of the Shopaholic series features a workaholic in this hysterically funny book. <br /> <br />High-powered London attorney Samantha Sweeting has just learned she has been made partner in the prestigious firm of Carter Spink, when she discovers a form on her desk that was to be filed with the court weeks ago. How could she have missed this deadline? <br /> <br />The results are disastrous. She notifies that bank and the firms concerned, realizes that nothing can avert the loss of 50 million pounds. In shock, she staggers out of the building and walks until she discovers she is at Paddington Station, where she boards a train and ends up in a tiny bucolic village--after imbibing several drinks on the train. <br /> <br />There she approaches a mansion intending to ask for water and some aspirin, when the homeowners take her for an applicant for the housekeeper position of. She stays on, thinking \\"what the heck,\\" she can do this. However, Samantha did not know that vacuum cleaners have bags, or how to operate her oven or washing machine, and quickly she is in over her head. <br /> <br />Hunky gardener Nathanial enlists the help of his mother to teach Sam the basics of cooking and cleaning, and he tries hard not to laugh at her attempts. Eventually Sam uncovers the truth about the mislaid document and the firms involved, and when she informs her bosses at Carter Spink, they decide they want her back. <br /> <br />Read the book to find out if she wants that life back--the 7-day-a-week, 12-hour-a-day-work schedule, with no time for friends or family--or what happens. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Good story for fun reading.
B00006IU73|3.0|After hearing a lot about this band being a great new \\"progressive\\" rock band I went out and picked up this album. I didn't know anything in particular about \\"In Abstencia\\" but it was all they had at the record shop so I gave it a chance. Needless to say when I listened to it I kept waiting for the progressive part to kick in. It never happened, instead what I got was new alternative rock that a million other bands could have put out. Overall it's not bad for that type of music but it has none of the musical virtuosity or interesting time signature changes or chord progessions that make up what most people think of as progressive rock. The vocals aren't particularly impressive either. I've read that their earlier albums are more traditionally progresive but I can say for certain that In Abstencia is not progressive rock
B00006J3WH|5.0|The cd is awesome. There were no scratches or anything, it's like completely brand new and the quality is totally awesome.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I have searched long and hard for a series that is as good as Buffy! Not only do we have two VERY HOT men starring in this show but the chemistry between them is outstanding. We have Dean and Sam, two brothers who lost their mother in the most horrific way possible. Dean is a true warrior, doing what his father taught him, hunting and killing demons and helping people along the way. Sam however wants a normal life but all that changed when his girlfriend Jessica was killed in the same way that his mother was. To top it off their father is missing and they are desperate to find him. Sam really wants to avenge Jessica's death and he thinks that finding his father will help to do that. His father knows more about \\"the demon\\" than anyone. <br /> <br />We are still to find out more about Sam and why all the evil things that happen seem to revolve around him. His brother Dean seems to be his protector and I think he knows more about Sam then he's telling. I cant wait until season 2. I live in Australia and have to wait a long time to see new seasons. I hope I can keep off the internet to find out what happens! <br /> <br />Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are fantastic and seem to really get along behind the scenes. I have been waiting for Jensen to pick up another great project since Dark Angel. <br /> <br />This box set has great special features and is well worth buying. If you are a fan of the supernatural and unexplained then this one is for you. I strongly recommend!
0071410945|5.0|I am not an advertising professional but in the profession of scientific research. Yet this book (which was written in the 1940s for advertising people) is just as relevant to my work as it is to anyone else who is a knowledge worker. This little book is one of the simplest summaries of commonsense---and articulating common sense is this book's greatest virtue. The book lays out a five step process for generating novel and not-so-novel ideas, articulating them, and giving them a life of their own. There are no examples, no case studies, just crisply articulated common-sense that you can put to immediate use. Everything that he says is stuff that you likely already know, so this is not one of those books that talks the lofty talk about \\"retraining your mind\\" and such obscure, undoable things. The idea in this book that most resonated with me was his comment that novel ideas are simply unusual connections among things that already exist and you might already know. The book takes about an hour to read from cover to cover (and I'm not even a fast reader).  <br /> <br />Although Mr. Bernbach probably never intended this book for consumers like me in the scientific research profession, I'd bet my money that this little gem might be just as \\"duh\\" or \\"aha\\"-evoking to people in any other knowledge-intensive line of white-collar work. The only note of caution: This book was originally written in the 1940s and the gender bias (\\"the creative man,\\" \\"he\\") is pervasive throughout its 48 pages.   <br /> <br />If you are in a profession where your \\"wealth\\" is measured in intellectual output, this is some of the best seven dollars you can invest in your education. Highly recommended for anyone whose profession requires novelty, new ideas, and creativity. Buy---don't borrow--read, reread, and dog ear this little gem!
B00009MGGI|5.0|If you've ever wondered what happens behind the scenes and in the private offices in the political world, this series is for you. Great performance by Ian Richardson and supporting cast. When watching each episode you wish it would go on for another hour. Great series.

B00005J6RE|4.0|Even though the original \\"Trek\\" is showing its age and the effects weren't digital.  I think they are still fun to watch. The Omega Glory on this set was one I remember the first time I saw. How cool, an \\"earth-type\\" planet that had a war we didn't then the shocking ending.  Maybe to corny for belief but if you just sit back and don't look too deep these shows still are VERY entertaining.
B00003CXRM|5.0|From the very first time I saw this movie I knew I had to own a copy. It is smart, funny and worthy of multiple viewings.
B00005JNS0|5.0|The story line is well written and doesn't stray off into side issues. The history in the story is well researched and educates the viewers while it piques their interest.  Everybody gets the point of the story while being entertained by beautiful, smooth animation.  The characters are very well developed and every family member has a favorite character because the actors chosen to do the voices made the vehicles come to life.  It is fun later to think of interesting people you know as one of the vehicles in the movie.  Adults will especially enjoy the wonderful one-liners, which are the reason this is fun to watch over and over--to hear the lines you missed while you were laughing the last time you watched.  This movie is a must own.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My 3 year old loved the Finding Nemo DVD (enough to watch it over 20 times) so we decided to take him to the movies to see Cars.  You've never seen a 3 and half year old behave so well!  He was mesmerized.  We went back 2 more times.  Now the DVD is out and he's already seen it twice.  He laughed out loud during Mater and the Ghost Light short.  He gets the humor and loves the characters - Dab Gum Pixar - you've done it again!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love this show! The first season was amazing. Every episode is great and the special features are incredible. I love it! ;) I watched the gag real about five times in a row when I got it. A day in the life of Jared and Jensen is also very cool. I recommend this to anyone and everyone because it is the best show ever! ;)
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|In no way am I going to be able to convince you with words about how great this album is, the only way to discover it is to listen it yourself: \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\", \\"Famous Last Words\\", and \\"Mama\\" are pure excellence. As for me, I can't stop listening to \\"The Black Parade\\", it beats out Muse \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" for my vote of best album of 2006. To sum it up in one word: amazing.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I give this disc 5 stars because it is the best sample of Gilmour doing what he does availabel on DVD.     Lets first start with the video quality. To correct the last reviewer this is a 4:3 DVD NOT 16:9. When stretched out to 16:9 the video is decent, but not great. Dont expect a R.W. In The Flesh Live type of video quality. This concert was recorded on video instead of film, and that is a mistake. Never the less you wont be disappointed with the results of the digital remastering.    The sound quality is amazing. The band is tight and very talented. This disc is more of a Gilmour production then Pink Floyd. He is clearly the star of the show and does almost all of the singing.     The first disc is almost completely Division Bell and Momentary Lapse material. If thats your bag you will love that disc. I prefer the older and deeper Floyd sound. However Gilmour makes the newer Floyd material amazing when heard and seen live. A major complement to the various talents of this great performer. The second half is Dark Side and some classics for the encoure including the best version of Run Like Hell you'll hear. I saw Gilmour this year and this disc does a great job of recreating the experience. I highly recommend this disc but In The Flesh Live is a better disc with better songs.
B00004T8RK|1.0|This album SUCKS! <br />I have listened to it Stoned, Sober, Drunk, Drunk & Stoned, Sober & on a Fast. <br />It Sucks. <br />The Kings have No Clothes. <br />Wake Up! <br />-Domo
B000I5X81A|4.0|This album was long overdue. I love the laid back quality of JJ Cale and Clapton is the best living guitarist. Beautiful guitar work from these two along with Derek Trucks. This album contains several genre's of music and thats what makes it special.....................
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I've been a fan of Idina Menzel's since her \\"Rent\\" days, and also of Kristen Chenoweth since \\"You're a good man Charlie Brown.\\"  Needless to say, I had high expectations.  Idina and Kristen sound beautiful together and the rest of the ensemble is equally satisfying.  If you are fan of Broadway musicals, you'll be pleased with this one.  Defying Gravity is the signature song and it's one of those inspirational, I am superwoman, kind of feel good songs!  It's fun, sad, but challenging.  I loved it.
0977326403|4.0|This is a very good companion to the Good to Great book. However, you really need to read the first book to truly understand this one.  As someone working in the public sector for a not-for-profit, this book made more sense than G2G alone.  I would definitely recommend this book for anyone in the nonprofit sector. Stay focused.  Remember your hedgehog.

B00000AFWW|5.0|Ok, I didn't find any Hole cd to buy here in Brazil, that is why I bought it from Amazon.com. It took 15 days to arrive in my house, very fast. <br /> <br />Well, I decided to buy Hole because I was curious to hear Courtney Love singing. I started to hear this cd through web radio and I loved it, that's why I bought. I know this is the most commercial Hole cd but it is nice to hear all the time. Now I'm planning to buy the rest. <br /> <br />Yes, my opinion for you, if you are in doubt or if you are curious too is 'buy it'. <br />
0446608955|5.0|I am from Romania and the book arrived in about 2 weeks. I am very pleased of it, it has no damages, it arrived quickly and, most important, it's a very good book. A touching story that will make you laugh and cry. I recommend it!

B0007LXPBI|5.0|The new parent trap is a great movie to watch with your preteen (grand)children. The 'twins' are excellent actresses. The parents well chosen. <br />I love that a good story (Das doppelte Lottchen by Eich Kaestner) was again made into a good, enjoyable movie. As a writer of children stories I would love for someone to make one of my stories into a movie for the world to enjoy. <br />Anybody listening???!!! <br />God bless <br />Margrit
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If Firefly was on a much more appropriate cable network like Sci-Fi or even NBC, I think it would have went AT LEAST 5 seasons.  Fox (the spawning ground for Married...with Children and The Simpsons) was just not the right network to air such a finely crafted show like Firefly.  I know it had SOMETHING to do with Joss Whedon's Buffy/Angel fame that attracted Fox but Firefly's subject matter, although set in outer-space, was completely different and more realistic from the fantasy world of Buffy/Angel.  Such a shame it got cancelled but hooray for DVD!
0440242576|3.0|This was a lighthearted book poking fun at how comercialistic Christmas has become.  The characters are stereotypical and the plot is predictable.  But a fine read if you're looking for something light and humorous.<br /><br />Luther and Nora's decision to skip Christmas and go on a cruise is what many people wish they could do.  However, how they go about it is a bit silly.  They both agree to it, so they should be united together.  But Nora seems to see everything that goes wrong as Luther's fault and doesn't help at all.  When their daughter decides to come home for Christmas - instead of behing honest, she lies to her daughter and makes things worse.  If I was their daughter and found out later about the deception, I would have been very upset.  Luther on the other hand is grinch-like.  He begrudges giving and spending money but he gets the spirit of Christmas in the end.  It's also hard to believe that they spend over $6,000 on Christmas every year, though.  We spend less than $500 for gifts and decorations.  Maybe they need to learn how to budget.  Or maybe their problems go deeper than money and they need counseling.<br /><br />Of course, without the above conflicts the story would have gone smoother.  But for me, it was hard to relate to the couple and spent much of the book just being frustrated at them.<br /><br />The people I liked most were the Shiels.  They were the ones who seemed to have depth to them yet they were not in the story much at all.  They were once superficial and proud but now they were humble and trying to make the best of Christmas that year.  They were foils to the Kranks.<br /><br />Read this if you want something light and funny and don't mind a frustration or two with the main characters.  It's a situation comedy type story with a little lesson in the spirit of Christmas at the end.
0618680004|1.0|I read about this book in my local newspaper, along with comments from the head of the state athiest association. I was very eager to read it, and ordered it immediately. I consider myself to be an intelligent, educated person, but I could not begin to understand this book. The introduction promised everything I had hoped, but it was impossible for me to read. I've read nothing by Dawkins in the past, and maybe I just don't 'get' his writing style but, as I said, this book was way beyond me. I tried scanning it for portions that made sense, but ended up literally throwing it in the garbage can (I was at an airport) after about 30 agonizing minutes, and didn't look back. I am a staunch athiest and was really looking forward to reading a lot of support for my beliefs. I was extremely disappointed.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|As always, David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright present an awesome show...as much a visual spectacle as one of the best concerts EVER.  This last tour together shines on and is not obscured by clouds.
0156030322|4.0|After a harrowing childhood that ended with sitting at the table while his mother murdered his father, Driver gets shunted into the foster care system.  At 16 he runs away and ends up in Hollywood where he does the one thing he loves and does best:  driving.  But while the stunt driver business provides him enough success to get him by, Driver finds himself drawn into the lives and struggles of others.  One of them is an armed robber with a wife and child that Driver cares about.  But Driver has rules about his life in crime:  he drives, that's but.  When a robbery goes wrong, though, and Driver's friend is betrayed, he gets drawn into a headlong rush toward vengeance.<br /><br />James Sallis is the author of the six-book (thus far) series about New Orleans private eye Lew Griffin.  He's started a new series featuring troubled, ex-police detective Turner.  In addition to his writing, Sallis also writes poetry and is a musicologist.<br /><br />Although it comes in at just under 160 pages and is told with verve and brevity, DRIVE is no means a simplistic read.  The story doubles back on itself like a snake from time to time, jumping linear progression with the story without warning or any kind of demarcation.  I found myself lost a few times, but the story kept drawing me in.  The way that the novel progresssed and regressed became familiar and I enjoyed the way that I saw the plot tighten while at the same time I glimpsed more of Driver's background.<br /><br />Written in a noir style, Sallis delivers a gritty, fist-in-your-face read that hardboiled readers will enjoy.  The book isn't for everyone, but fans of Richard Stark and newcomer Duane Swierczynski should eat this up.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|What can you say about one of America's cultural icons?  This is a \\"must have\\" for all Dylan enthusiasts and for those who desire an overview.
B000301YY8|5.0|I was blown away by the feeling in this music.  You can almost feel the emotions as he sings.  I listen to it over and over.
B000FIMG68|4.0|The Season two of lost is very good. The DVD quality is better than the last season. The special features are excellent. Great value.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|I recommend this collection to anyone who loves movies, especially musicals.  It is wonderful to see my favorite musical stars in their heyday.  The liner notes don't help with scene selection but the on screen scene selection is good.  It will take you a while to get through all the material.
B0000067L4|3.0|Cream clearly didn't have much unreleased on the shelf when they released this. It would be better to call it \\"Cream Live (Plus 3 Studio Cuts.)\\" <br />The live stuff is the usual excess, expecially their destroying of \\"I'm So Glad.\\" What saves the album and gets the three stars are \\"Badge\\" and \\"Doing That Scrapyard Thing.\\" You don't need to buy this album to get \\"Badge.\\" It's on about a dozen greatest hits albums. But \\"Doing That Scrapyard Thing\\" is a little harder to find. It is a vastly underrated song, but I've always been a Jack Bruce fan.
068485743X|4.0|Noah Lukeman has a good \\"handle\\" on what makes a great beginning in a novel. He very cleverly shows humorous examples of what NOT TO DO. In this book, Lukeman covers everything from Preliminary Problems through Dialogue (very important!) to The Bigger Picture. I love his insightful humor, but must say that Donald Maass'\\"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook\\" gives the writer a hands-on method for working through everything from Character/Plot Development to General Story Techniques. In the final analysis, the writer can read, read, & read, but he/she must then sit down and WRITE THE DARNED THING!! It's the writing/rewriting that makes one a writer!
B000001FGG|4.0|I remember when this one came out. A two record set. Wow! Unheard of at the time. The funny thing is it would almost fit on one CD today. <br /> <br />I'm not a fan of the live stuff here. Drum solos aren't my thing, and 20 minutes of \\"Spoonful\\" is about 14 minutes too long. The studio cuts are top notch and remain ahead of their time. \\"Passing The Time\\" sounds like it could have been recorded in the 1700's. \\"White Room\\" remains an all time classic, but what does it really mean?  <br /> <br />All in all, an ambitious album filled with great songs.
B000003CMB|5.0|Sorry folks, but I can't write an objective review of At Fillmore East because it has been my favorite album of all-time for three decades. I have owned this in one format or another since I bought the double LP for $6.98 in a Florida department store in 1972. Still today, it is the most listened to CD I own, and it just keeps getting better, year after year. The magic of the original Allman Brothers Band, the magic of the Fillmore East and the magic of rock music in the early 1970s are all captured on this album, and you get blues, rock and jazz in extended jams to take you on the magic carpet ride to get there. This is rock music in it's purest form. Nothing phony here; no studio tricks, overdubs or slick production. These are musicians \\"in the zone\\", so perfectly tuned in to each other that you can feel it in this music. These guys were playing for the love of music, each other and their audience, not for the love of money. Duane Allman, Gregg Allman, Dickey Betts, Berry Oakley, Butch Trucks and Jaimoe. It only happens once in a lifetime, and it's pure joy!
B000065VA1|5.0|Jeez, what a great album! I know, it had gasp! commercial success, but not from selling out. Any commercial success Peter Gabriel ever had was on his terms. You notice he made no attempt to capitalize on the success of this album by coming out with an identical album a year later, like anyone else would do. <br /> <br />All of the songs are top notch here. I prefer the original sequencing, because on the vinyl version, it was about the most incredible side one ever (\\"Red Rain\\", followed by \\"Sledge Hammer,\\" \\"Don't Give Up\\" and \\"That Voice Again.\\" One of the highlights, of course is \\"In Your Eyes,\\" which is still a compelling song, despite its involvment in the movie \\"Say Anything.\\"
B000000WG4|5.0|I was just a teen when my older brother played the record \\"Tubular Bells\\" for me. As a fan of Classical Rock type of music, I was thought this was a wild yet mellow album.  In 2002, I put together a list of my albums I would like to replace with CD's. Tubular Bells was on the list with about 400 other albums.  I have been doing this as well as I can with money and availibility of the CD's. I have just arrived at Tubular Bells and am happy to say the sound quality of the CD enhances the listening pleasure of this CD over the album. In some CDs, there seems to be something lost in the recording, not with this one.
B000001FS3|5.0|Simply the most amazing album of my lifetime. I won't bore you with personal stories of life changing experiences that this album was a part of, but trust me when I say no album has touched my life like this one.    From the barely audible opening strains of \\"Where The Streets Have No Name,\\" to the final cut, this album is relentless. \\"With Or Without You\\" is the quintessential single. Songs like \\"Red Hill Mining Town,\\" and, of course, \\"One Tree Hill\\" deserved more air play than they got. Fantastic album.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This is one of those CDs you can listen to straight through - every song is money.
B00006LLNU|5.0|If you're tired and stressed from a long, hard week at work/school and you just need to relax, or you have trouble sleeping and you need some calming, relaxing music to put you to sleep, then buy this album. Sigur Ros have done it again with a fine display of talent across the musicians creating a wonderful blend of familiar and not-so-familiar tones into 8 untitled songs. I think highly of Sigur Ros now, not only for being such wonderful musicians but also for the quality they bring to the music industry.
0743298020|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale -it's a ghost story, a mystery in the vein of the Brontes and DuMaurier -- involving secrets, lies and half truths.  It has many red herrings throughout thrown in, plus a surprise ending.  This book was great! <br /> <br />There are two heroines, Vida Winter, a famous author, whose life story is coming to an end, and Margaret Lea, a young, niave, bookish girl who sells books in her father's bookstore.   <br /> <br />Vida has for years been giving versions of her life to biographers, but the end of her life is coming to end and she wants to set the story straight and has called upon Margaret to write it for her.  From this, Margaret must sort what is true and what is not true - but then there are the secrets that Vida is not telling - yet.   <br /> <br />But the, Margaret has a story of her own - a dead sister - a dead twin.  How is this involved in Vida's own life - it is up the reader to find out.   <br /> <br />
0340818867|5.0|I started this book 3 days after returning from my first trip to America. Whilst in America I became aware of the huge cultural difference between the friendly people of the USA and traditional Brits amongst whom I've lived almost my whole life - I found much of American behaviour inexplicable and rather rude and personal towards someone they didn't know. I breathed a sigh of relief when returning to England, back amongst normal people who aren't continually nosy and telling you what they think about politics, religion and anything else the whole time.<br /><br />I wish I'd read this book before I went. Not that I wouldn't have found a lot of American behaviour strange after reading it (I would still have done) but I would have been more aware of my cultural disabilities and how weird I must seem to them.<br /><br />That's the power of this book - you can dip into almost any page, read a paragraph and say \\"that's me!\\" Kate Fox has studied the English for 10 years with remarkable acuity and she is able to identify behaviours that, to us, are entirely normal but are actually just part of our collective odd English behaviour patterns. When a man I had just been introduced to in America said \\"So, tell me all about yourself\\" I was left gaping at him in horror; `Watching The English' describes how people in the UK never share personal information unless they know someone particularly well - and in fact most people don't even introduce themselves to start with - my horror was expected and justified as I had never before been called upon to `blow my own trumpet' and it is completely counter to British reserve and our self-effacing nature. Her comments on ignoring other passengers on train journeys, on our national obsession with pets, on queuing, mobile phone use, class distinctions, dislike of fuss and bother and so many other areas rang completely true.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about the book (and that I am English would of course confirm this) was that she wrote with a lot of humour and throw-away one-liners, she wasn't hugely pro-English or anti-English, she wasn't anti-American (despite them being so ODD!) and was able to illustrate her comments through the vast amount of research that she has done, including interviewing English people and foreigners and carrying out experiments herself (such as bumping into people in the street and seeing if they say `sorry' - the English generally do).<br /><br />It's a surprisingly long book and not something you'd sit and read in one go. In fact I think it works best as something you dip into and that's how I've read it over a few days - opening it at random, reading a few pages, then flicking on. It's all subdivided into different headings and subheadings and doesn't really need to be read linearly to be understood. I found myself reading out vast tranches of it to anyone in earshot as it was so amusing and accurate. I read the introduction last of all, having read many comments by Amazon reviews that it was rather hard going - I found the introduction fine, but perhaps that was because by then I had enjoyed the book and found that I very much appreciated the author, her self-deprecating humour and her willingness to share her foibles and those of her family.<br /><br />This book would make an ideal present for any English people out there who want to laugh at themselves (that's all of us), for anyone about to travel to a different culture (to avoid misunderstandings through others' behaviour) and particularly for those living in other countries who want to visit us without putting their foot in it at every conceivable opportunity.she wrote with a lot of humour and throw-away one-liners, she wasn't hugely pro-English or anti-English, she wasn't anti-American (despite them being so ODD!) and was able to illustrate her comments through the vast amount of research that she has done, including interviewing English people and foreigners and carrying out experiments herself (such as bumping into people in the street and seeing if they say `sorry' - the English generally do). <br /> <br />It's a surprisingly long book and not something you'd sit and read in one go.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|I had admired Master and Commander as a fine film when I saw it in the theater.  We rented the standard widescreen DVD of the set, and fell further in love with it, and tended to leave it on when one of the cable channels was rebroadcasting it.  So I wound up buying a copy of the super-genius deluxe edition. <br /> <br />It's a 2-disc set.  The first disc is identical to the standard edition release.  Interestingly there's no director's commentary -- leaving Weir as one of the few filmmakers who wants to have the film speak for itself. <br /> <br />The second disc is chock full of behind-the-scenes features, much of which concentrates on the phenomenal levels of effort that were required to synthesize much of the footage in the movie.  The CGI team worked with a life-sized recreation of a 19th century tall ship, a \\"bigature\\" (very large miniature) in a tank, footage taken as a Captain Cook recreation sailed around Cape Horn, and a batch of other stuff.  Weir started off committed to trying to make the thing look and feel as realistic as possible, and it becomes clear from the featurettes on model shots, CGI work and sound design that there isn't a thing on the screen that Weir didn't want to be there.  His group's fanatical attention to detail reminds me of the behind the scenes work of Akira Kurosawa's team at its very finest.  And each reviewing of the movie brings out more levels of detail (even as the illusion has been broken -- no, that's not really a guy being left behind in a storm at Cape Horn, though I was fooled in the theater), including the interesting characterization of Lord Blakeney as the sort of \\"fighting naturalist\\" that he mentions in the film -- part man-of-action as Aubrey is, part contemplative man-of-science as Maturin is.  Too bad there are no plans for a sequel; I for one would love to see how Blakeney turns out. <br /> <br />For devotees of the film, filmmaking and Peter Weir, this is more than worth the money and an essential part of our library.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|For me this is one of the all time great albums of Bob Dylan.  My favourite still remeins his second album, \\"Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" but \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" is a very close second.  Many of the songs on this CD remind me of Dylan's folk music roots that sadly became less evident in his later music. <br />
B000J10ERO|5.0|Im not a big Superman fan other than the first one with Christopher Reeve. Not into the comics or other  tv shows so I was surprised at how well done this movie turned out to be. Brandon Routh does a remarkable job of handling Clark Kent/Superman and has great chemistry with Kate Bosworth. There are about a dozen absolutely extraordinary scenes in this film that no other film can touch.  <br />I felt I would enjoy this movie but I had no idea it would be my favorite film of the year. Simply amazing.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Honestly? For me it doesn't matter WHAT Josh Groban sings as long as he just SINGS.   His is a voice that you never tire of and that never ceases to amaze and touch your heart.    That said - yes, I love \\"AWAKE\\". It simply shines.     Yes, it is a little different from \\"CLOSER\\", but as mch as I adore that second album I am glad he chose to grow as an artist instead.  Most other artists would probably have chosen to stick to the multi-platinum formular of \\"CLOSER\\" to make more money - and would end up doing one \\"CLOSER\\" after another.    Thank God Josh Groban is too clever and too talented to walk into this trap. He chose his own way instead. And it works - but whith his breathtakig voice he simply can do nothing wrong. Keep singing, Josh!    Two advices:  1. Spend a little more money and purchase the special DVD/CD version.          Just the song \\"Awake\\" alone is worth it!  2. Go see Josh Groban live! His concerts are stunning. He's one of very      few artists out there who are even better live than on a record!
B00006RCNJ|5.0|Don't be swayed by the reviews critical of the lighting. There is some glare, but you'll soon forget this as the concert unfolds. Anyone who has seen an Andre Rieu performace either live (as we did in Denver last week) or on DVD knows that Rieu really knows how to whip up a quiet croud into a musical frenzy.  <br /> <br />All heck begins to break lose about 2/3 into the concert when balloons are released into the huge audience at the Royal Albert Hall. Then begins a series of encores starting with a Glenn Miller and Andrews Sisters medley - you have to see this - must be at least 10,000 people jumping, singing, dancing with joy - and then unbelievably things just begin to fire up. At the end of the concert the orchestra plays a rousing Stars and Stripes (keep in mind this is after 9/11) and then a bag pipe band joins in Auld Lang Syne. I'd buy this disc just for this. <br /> <br />Thank you Andre Rieu and orchestra members for bringing this music to us. Those of you who are leary, hesitate no longer - buy and enjoy. The Dublin performance is also excellent but the 2 are different enough to get both. What fun, unforgettable, life-giving performances, even for a stodgy classical music nut like me.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|<br />    I do think this is a great movie collecion.  The complete movie plot <br />    is very interesting and out of the ordinary and common.  I am looking <br />    forward to see the second season. <br /> <br />    The performance of all the actors is astounding and really convincing. <br />    Good art work! <br />                                   Prof. Eliezer Negron <br />                                   Ciales, Puerto Rico
B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is so perfect.  It is filled with the funny scenes and excitement.  This is a well-made movie.  For the story, it is very straight forward that Lightning McQueen is attempted to go to California for the tiebreaker race.  However, during that time, he has to face a tough time when his delivery truck suddenly falls off and McQueen falls out of the truck and when he chases the truck back by speeding, he is caught by police and he has to do a community service and the time is against him too, he has to beat his pressure to secure a spot for that important race for him.  This story although is kind of easy to understand, it is basically good.  For the acting, they are all good.  For the direction, it is fantastic because all the scenes are logical.  My favorite part for this movie is the visual.  They are so funny and of course, Ka-Chow!  For the music, the songs feature in this movie is fantastic.  For the sound effects, they are all fantastic as well.  Overall, this is a good movie.
B000935TV8|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.  Have not stopped playing it since it arrived and haven't gotten sick of it yet either.  I bought it because I heard just one track briefly on the radio - bit of a gamble but it paid off.  Great to drive to!  Love the fast violin playing and the french horns.  Rameau was one cool dude.  Can't wait to share it with my dad.  Am even wondering if I could wire the garage for sound so we can listen to Rameau while working there over Christmas!  (Sorry this is not a high brow, classical music critic kind of review with lots of technical observations - I'm just a passionate classical music lover speaking from the heart).
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer continues to amaze me with his creative lyrics, amazing guitar skills, and musical versatility. This CD will not disappoint. From the great vibes of \\"Vultures\\" to the thought-provoking lyrics of \\"Waiting on the World to Change,\\" John Mayer is one of the most creative artists of our time. And, as a 50+ female, he's also not hard on the eyes. I've got all his CD's and can't wait for the next.
B0002UOK04|4.0|Great sound a combination of melodic and black metal. Worth byuing it.
B000002HEM|5.0|Si hay que calificar este CD la palabra es simplemente maravilloso, alla por 1994 escuche \\"Because the night\\" y quedo almacenada en mi memoria hasta que aqui en Amazon logre explorar mas de este disco y de la musica de 10,000 maniacs y quede totalmente enamorado de la voz de Merchant, ojala siga produciendo musica para deleyte de sus fans y el mio propio.
B000H305U0|5.0|better than i expected. i listen to every single song. i think its his better than his first. i really recommend it.
1401308201|5.0|I bought this book for my 15-year-old daughter who has seen Wicked the play and who already has several of the books.  She absolutely LOVED this book!  Everything about the book is awesome.  The distressed look of the cover of the book adds so much to the book in making it have the appearance of a spell book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.  She has been through this book over and over again and loves to show it off to her friends.  What a great book!!
B000FIMG68|5.0|i recieved this DVD when expected in the condition it was listed in. i have no problems with the product
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Great CD.  Just as good as, or better than thier first album
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Christian looks so different than he did in Batman.  In The Machinist, he's a scrawny sad character that just wants to comprehend the world that he lives in.  So he confides in Jennifer, who's a prostitute.  He goes on a mission to try and learn what's behind the \\"conspiracy\\" that's willing to take his sanity.   <br /> <br />You almost feel bad since in this day and age, you see mentally sick people walking the streets...aimlessly, with no one to turn to, but their voices that's \\"inspiring\\" them to commit crimes against nature.  Yet we as a society, opt to look the other way.  This film forces the audience to recognize the five W's and the necessity of finding closure to Christian.  <br /> <br />Truth hurts and unfortunately, in this film, the truth is also very sad. <br /> <br />
B000000H66|5.0|Lately, I've been looking into a lot of metal, and Death is one of the first I checked out (along with Opeth, In Flames, Children of Bodom, and Queensryche). I gotta say that this album is MUCH more than I expected. I didn't expect any ridiculous lyrics about feeling up corpses like Cannibal Corpse has, as I've read the lyrics are intelligent, but I didn't expect them to be this intelligent! Here are some lyrics from the title track: \\"Savor what you feel and what you see. Things may not seem important now, but may be tomorrow.\\" Come on people, those are lyrics to live by! So far, this is the only Death album I own, but it's definately made me motivated to buy more of their albums. Chuck Schuldiner includes complex musicianship, intelligent lyrics, and a high-pitched, completely comprehendible death metal growl in his music. Even if you hate death metal with a passion, you could love Chuck's work because his music is about spirituality and problems people face every day. Despite the technical guitar solos and bone-crushing drums, progressive elements are mixed in with Symbolic making it catchier than most death metal. There are also some acoustic passages on Misanthrope and Perennial Quest. Even though Chuck's lead guitar would have to be the most outstanding instrument, Bob  Koelble's rythm guitar (and he also plays dual solos with Chuck on some of the songs), Gene Hoglan's drums, and Kelly Conlon's bass (which is actually audible!) are also very impressive. Anyway, here are my thoughts on the songs.<br /><br />The title track opens up with some pounding guitars and symbols, and get a lot heavier at the 15 second mark.  Then Chuck's growl comes in with \\"I don't mean to dwell, but I just can't help myself!\\" There's a great solo by Chuck, and Bob solos with him for the first 5 seconds of the solo. And then there's Kelly and Gene pounding away in their rythm section. It's about how peopl always take everything for granted, and never think that things may not be what they are tomorrow. Zero Tolerance opens up with some jazzy drums, but gets heavier when Chuck's voice and his guitar and Bob's guitar kick in. We also get a quick solo after the first 4 verses. And after another 4 verses, we get ANOTHER guitar solo! I think this song is about injustices in the world. Around the 2:50 mark, Chuck and Bob do some killer dual guitar solos. Possibly the best on the whole album! Empty Words opens up with some tribal drums, synth effects, and mellow guitar work, but then hits you like the prvious track does. I believe this song is about the hypocrisies of politics (\\"The answer cannot be found in the writing of others, or the words of a trained mind!\\"). And of course, more great guitar work from Chuck. Sacred Serenity opens up with some pounding bass and drum work from Kelly and Gene, then the guitars come in and we get a solo from Chuck. I'm not quite sure what it's about, but I'll update this review once I've decided what I think the meaning of it is. Nonetheless, it's an awesome song. There's also a calm interlude with Chuck soloing in the middle. 1,000 Eyes is a little catchier than the last 4 tracks (but those tracks are still awesome). I think this song is about racism against African Americans and/or about the slave movments back in the old days (\\"Privacy and intamacy as we know it will be memory among many to be passed down to those who never knew it\\"). That may not be what it's really about (hey, for all I know this song could be about Santa Clause), but that's what I got from it. The chorus (\\"Living in the pupil of 1,00 eyes!\\") is also very catchy, and I've been finding myself humming it from time to time. 1,00 Eyes also has a very creepy ending, with all the intruments and Chuck's voice echoeing continuously until they dissappear. You also hear Chuck yell (We Are Enslaved!\\") Next comes Without Judgement, which I think is about court issues and how the juries can be tricked so easily with cheesy sad stories. Once again, I don't knowif that's what it's about, but that's my opinion. There are some creepy guitar effects in this song too. Crystal Mountain is my 2nd favorite track off the album. It's the catchiest yet most aggressive on the album. It's about, I believe, tyranny and dictatorship (\\"All the traps are set to confine all who get in the way of the divine!\\"). The solo from Chuck is, like all the other solos, nothing short of brilliant. Misanthrope seems to be about the evolution of mankind (\\"Knowledge is taken in by curious life forms\\"). Perennial Quest is quite possibly the most heartfelt song off the whole album, and my favorite off it. It's about every-day life, and questions people ask and problems go through. Though the instrumentation and vocal style may not be emotional, the lyrics certainly are. It just shows you what a genius Chuck is.<br /><br />I don't regrety buying this at all, and I look forward to buying more of Death's albums. If you thought death metal is just a bunch of unintelligible lyrics about killing god and necrophlia (*cough* Cannibal Corpse and Deicide *cough*), there are some DM bands like that, but Death is not one of them. Death is intelligent, heartfelt, and talented, while Cannibal Corpse is stupid, tastesless, and boring.<br /><br />To end this review, I would like to join all the other 5-star reviewers on this page and say: RIP Chuck Schuldiner.'s what it's about, but that's my opinion.

B000GFLKF8|5.0|Spike Lee finally came through on his fourth film with Mr. Washington.  This film is very moving and intriguing. Nail biting.  Exciting.  Smart casting and directing.  Clive Owen wanted to help out those who deserve it, unlike the big tycoon entrepreneur...selling himself out and trying to hide his past.  This film demonstrated that everyone has demons, and no matter how hard someone tries to hide the past, and how rich you are...there will be someone out there who is smarter and willing to take even bigger risks to reward himself and at the same time reveal the true meaning of pride.  Furthermore, Jodie was playing a dirty lawyer.  Stopping at nothing to achieving her greed on the front page and scoring points to achieve the unremarkable...betrayal. <br /> <br />This film had all aspects of our human nature.  What more can anyone ask for.  It makes you think...Would you risk your life to prove that someone else's life is worth more than yours if you get caught? <br />
B000A6T262|5.0|If you tuned in to the great new show way back in the rusty dusty days before Survivor, this is the essential collection. Oh William Shatner can't act a lick and the effects are primitive, but the writting sparkles and the dialogue sizzles and there's Grace Lee Whitney. When the Next Generation comes along you get everything that was missing from the original series, acting! Patrick Stewart makes the job look more like a career and Brent Spiner's Data almost matches Spock. Even the first, Star Trek: The Un-Motion Picture looks good. If you've never seen the Spock trilogy or haven't seen it lately then the vivid remastered DVD of The Wrath of Khan, The Search For Spock and Voyage Home will make you smile. Live long and prosper
0380820846|4.0|A very different kind of love story, and yes... this was a love story and one of the better of the series!  Penelope had loved Colin for years, and the evolution of his feelings for her was entertaining to read.  There was plenty of other Bridgerton's for all the characters to play against, which is one of Quinn's strengths. I particularly enjoyed the scene in which Colin was attempting ask Mrs. Featherington for Penelope's hand.... very funny.  I did not, however, enjoy the scene in which Mrs. Whistledown was revealed.  It was way overdone and ridiculous to make a grand announcement.  I think Quinn could have come up with something better if it was necessary to unmask her at all.
0393327655|5.0|Brilliant. Sam Harris portends the calamitous pathway that irrational, divisive thinking (religious & secular) will cause. He also spells out the necessary suggestions and goals for humans to evolve to the point where we're globally not at risk of suffering due to anachronistic prejudices.
0307263118|5.0|I wasn't expecting to like this book as much as I did because of the controversy over the Booker award.  However, I found it very moving and strongly recommend it.
1594200823|3.0|Very educational read, good writing style. It's now difficult to imagine where corn *doesn't* influence industrial agriculture, and how one might go about procuring a 'real' meal from 'real' food. Quite illustrative of the food pandemic our country is experiencing.
B00000AOUD|5.0|This album for me marked the beginning of Tull's progressive period and is of course a classic.  All the Tull reissues under Ian Anderson's guidance are wonderful and essential to any progressive collection.  So get them all but this is a great place to start. I love all that early stuff too of course.  Their mix of blues/jazz/rock and classical was unique and all those more song oriented recordings are wonderful but here Tull embraced the progressive movement head on and really created a classic extended piece over two sides.  Highly recommended!!
B00004TJTS|3.0|I was hoping for heart-warming. Frankie Muniz, who has turned out a wonderful actor, is painfully learning his craft at this point. He was probably capable of more at this time in his career but was probably hindered by the director, who only touches at the edges of a scene, not capable of fully expressing the emotional meaning inherent. Example: at the end of the film, when the grown-up boy is leaving on the bus for college, he doesn't even look at the dog, or even acknowledge him. In my opinion, he should have been hugging him to his chest, next to the bus door, with an slightly embarressed tear in his eye, then hand him to the grown-up girlfriend. Then as the bus pulls away the dog leaps from her arms and runs along side the bus, with Frankie looking down and crying. The dog would come to a stop, with the bus driving away in the distance. Last shot, a great close up of the dog's face, with sad eyes. That would have opened the flood gates for me. Maudlin, perhaps...but that's what this story is all about. What is the most disconcerting is that Frankie and the dog do not seem to have a real relationship. In nearly every scene the dog is totally focused on his trainer, just off screen, rather than his beloved boy. Check it our. Anyway, sorry to be such a curmudgeon. Yes I would like more innocent stories presented also, like this one. It's just frustrating to just get a luke-warm version.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Saw Barbra LIVE in concert in Chicago last night and the experience was once in a lifetime. .but if you weren't that lucky, this is probably my favorite album.  Although it's Barbra's duets, she still shines through and the songs are awesome.  It's an hour and 17 minutes long so when we're on a long drive, this is a great one to slip into the CD player. . .it's a great mix of her duets from the 60's to the present and each one is beautiful and unique on it's own.  My favorite is her duet with herself in \\"One Less Bell to Answer/A House is Not a Home\\" which is 100% Babs singing with herself.  Her voice is an instrument and she is a national treasure.  ENJOY
B000301YY8|5.0|This young man is incredible.  I knew when purchasing the cd I was going to like at least 2 songs. I love them all. I listen to country music period.  I saw him on Oprah, and was hooked.
B000KFTWIG|5.0|Once again it's Shomaster for my classic album reviews. Ready to Die has to be one of the top hip hop albums of all time. Biggie displayed much charisma, in-depth story telling and tricky word-play. The production matched his grimy voice. The highlight of the album has to be Everyday Struggle where Biggie tells the hardships of coming up in BK. The hook really catches you on the first listen. Respect is also a dope track. It has a reggae type feel with Biggie quoting some of his best stuff. The What matches him with then hot Method Man. Method Man is at his best with Biggie almost outshining the lyrical beast. Lyrically, Biggie is at his best on the song Warning. The sampled track is banging with an equally dope hook. Every track is a good listen with no skipping. For those who enjoy the radio friendly tracks he has a couple of those also. Juicy is a favorite club banger, and Big Poppa is a real catchy song. This is an album for anyone not just hip hop fans but all music fans.
0131103628|5.0|This is quite possibly the best book for C ever written, the classic Kernighan and Ritchie text. I consider it to be the foundational book for C programming. This is the foundation upon which an understanding and working knowledge of C can be built. Even if you never read it, which would be a tragedy, having this text in your library brings significant bragging rights.
B000FIMG68|1.0|The last disc was unplayable.  This was true for the replacement set. <br />Very disappointing!

B00005ASGG|5.0|Nostalgic, sour and powerful, Ford's \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" is one of the most memorable of all his Westerns... It's triggered off, and that's the right phrase, as it turns out, by flashback... The old device works well in the hands of the master... In fact, John Ford couldn't have got the feeling he's after in any other way...<br /><br />Ford seems to be mourning the Old West... It's a mixed feeling--composed of pride, regret, and a sense of the inherent injustice of life, and certain forebodings about the future...<br /><br />When a famous elderly Senator Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart), looking every inch the revered veteran political figure, gets off a train at a small Western town with his good lady (Vera Miles) you can tell by the way his eye roves for and rests on bits of time remembered that this is very much a sentimental journey... He's come to pay his last respects to a friend of the long, long ago--a small rancher in those days, played by John Wayne...<br /><br />Dissolve into the distant story--presenting young tenderfoot lawyer Stewart, eagerly intent on bringing Eastern law-books to bear on the problems of the West... His first taste of the West is a sound beating up, by a man called Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) who is a gunman employed by powerful cattlemen who oppose statehood for the Territory...<br /><br />Nor does Ranse find any real custom even among the law-abiding... He starts his career, in fact, as a kitchen hand in a caf&eacute; where he's been taken by Tom Doniphon (Wayne) following his nasty experience with Liberty... Ford is at his 'domestic' best in this caf&eacute; which is run by a Swedish pair (John Qualen and Jeannette Nolan) and where Ranse's wife-to-be is one of the employees... Stewart, wearing an apron contrasted with Wayne, pure frontiersman, is something to see in that kitchen... And there's always an edge to their meetings...<br /><br />It isn't hard to guess that before long the waitress, Tom's girl, is going to fail for the injured tenderfoot who takes on her education... Ranse eventually hangs up his sign in the office of the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody, a typical 'character', played by Edmond O'Brien, and from then on it's the story of a territory growing up and seeking statehood, with Ranse Stoddard maturing, too, as the natural leader of 'civilized' law and order aspirations...<br /><br />But none of it could have happened without the removal of Liberty Valance... Ranse confronts him and the bullets fly but the bullet that actually drops him comes from another Winchester in the shadows... Ranse goes to Washington on the strength of ridding the territory of Liberty Valance, but he knows that the shot was fired by another man...<br /><br />It's another film about the right man being in the right place at the right time in order to advance the course of Western civilization... Skillful, undoubtedly, but in this case the right man never gets his just deserts--if he ever wanted them, because the Wayne character in his way is just as much a part of the Old West as Marvin...<br /><br />Herein lies the bitter essence of the film... Wayne, at heart, is as contemptuous of what Stewart stands for--talk and conferences and thick legal tomes as the gunman is... And through him you feel Ford saying that the hard men who had it the hardest on the frontier are soon forgotten, and some of the frontier's simple virtues have been buried with them...<br /><br />\\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" is honest, unpretentious and deeply moving... In no other Ford Western does the audience feel so involved... The playing is brilliant--from the smallest role to the beautifully interpreted ambivalent relationship of Wayne and Stewart...<br /><br />Their acting style are quite different... Stewart had developed a standard repertoire of mannerisms that his public had come to cherish... Wayne's style was spare, clean and unadorned; he stood tall, very much himself... Certainly this film exemplifies a wonderful blending of three great talents, Ford's, Stewart's, and Wayne's, and their seamless mutual chemistry is one of the salient aspect of it...s film exemplifies a wonderful blending of three great talents, Ford's, Stewart's, and Wayne's, and their seamless mutual chemistry is one of the salient aspect of it...  <br /> <br />
B0000AUHPG|5.0|\\"Once upon a Time in the West\\" is Leone's masterpiece and certainly one of the best Westerns of all time... It is beautifully shot, perfectly cast, ambitious, erotic, humorous and wonderfully scored by Leone's regular composer Ennio Morricone, whose haunting melodies are just as important as the widely separated dialog occurring on the action..<br /><br />The film opens with an extreme close-ups of Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Lionel Stander waiting at a station for Charles Bronson... Henry Fonda has sent them to kill him...<br /><br />The railroad wants a property for its water well belonging to the newly widowed Claudia Cardinale, a fancy lady from New Orleans who just arrived in Flagstone and learns about the tragedy...<br /><br />Fonda, a despicable hired gun, kills her husband and orders, without a twinge of guilt, the slaughter of the entire family, innocents women and children...<br /><br />Henry Fonda, in a chilling performance, plays the cold-blooded murderer, the most vicious villain in Westerns history to ever ride the big country... the blue ice-eyed child killer, gunning down a 9-year old boy...<br /><br />Bronson as 'The Man' is like Clint Eastwood 'The Man With No Name,' with only one thing in common: they are the most ruthless heroes in Westerns history sharing the same character in their quality 'not' to say much in their need of emotions, in their fast draw, in their disinterest in women, in their air of mystery and in their macabre sense of humor...<br /><br />Their differences are also very clear: 'The Man With No Name' has no past whatsoever, and 'The Man' is motivated by revenge to settle an old personal score...<br /><br />Claudia Cardinale plays Jill, the well-proportioned, husky-voiced beauty, the lady, the businesswoman, the maker of coffee, the bearer of water involved with Fonda in an incredible perverse erotic sequence...<br /><br />The blood, the violence, the humor, the several gunfights and the final showdown have been constants in Leone's Westerns since \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\"...<br /><br />The highlights of his movie are so many: Leone's overwhelming shot when he raises his camera over the Flagstone train station office revealing the sprawling town; when he replaces a shot of a smoking gun with a shot of a smoking train; when he uses close-ups instead of dialog to reveal what a character is thinking; and the striking use of his extreme close-up in the final shootout... Leone builds up tension by slowly circling his two characters, focusing with his camera on their eyes, hands and guns while the level of the music is raised to evoke the action...<br /><br />The motion picture is a brave epic Western, extremely violent, immensely powerful and amusing...

6304698798|5.0|Sergio Leone's film follows the adventures of 3 ruthless outlaws...<br /><br />The 'Good' is Eastwood's unchanging and unshaven 'Stranger With No Name.' An unprincipled killer who stands only for his 45... He is quiet, inexpressive and cool, only seen once with a brief moment of humanity where his classic disinterest contrasts with the real tragedy of the American Civil War...<br /><br />The 'Bad' is an excellent supporting actor, a Western figure... With his long, thin opening eyes, deathly pale face and cruel voice, Lee Van Cleef is the merciless bounty hunter, ironically called 'Angel Eyes,' always ready to kill for a price...<br /><br />The 'Ugly' is Eli Wallach, a wild spirit with devil attitude... Tuco is charming but extremely dangerous...<br /><br />The pairing of Eastwood and Wallach is memorable for its black humor alternating each other's fate, motivated satisfactorily by their excessive desire for collecting the reward money...<br /><br />The quest: a treasure chest containing $200,000 in gold buried in a Confederate grave in Sad Hill Cemetery...<br /><br />\\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" had many haunting moments: Complicated bounty-hunter's con-games; the Stranger, in a frantic hurry, trying to load his empty gun before 3 killers sent by Tuco; a torturous walk across the desert in a blazing sun; the epic battle between Union and Confederate soldiers for the control of a strategic bridge where Leone's camera takes a slow ride surveying the magnitude of the Civil War carnage; and the final showdown in a huge graveyard, where each character, naturally, wants the money all to himself...<br /><br />The amusing scenes are provided by Tuco, sitting in bathtub with a lot of foam and one armed man enters his room saying: \\"I've been looking for you for 8 months... Now I find you in exactly the position that suits me...\\"<br /><br />The memorable scenes are when the Stranger finds himself in a dangerous situation at the hand of Tuco, who is just about to collect his vengeance by hanging his former partner...<br /><br />The stunning scenes when Leone's camera captures the touching moment in which a young man plays sweet romantic songs on his harmonica, while his eyes are streaming tears of disgrace and grief...<br /><br />The unforgettable scenes when the 'Stranger' leaving Tuco with a rope around his neck and the bandit begs for mercy while teetering on a wooden cross...<br /><br />The ultimate confrontation between the forces of good and evil when Leone spreads out long shots adjusting sound with action... Tensions mounts as the three protagonists 'shape in a triangular cinema clich&eacute;' Leone gets the audience's imagination with a geometric fight to the death, accompanied by a clear exciting music...<br /><br />Leone's camera captures every straight lines, every nervous energy, every tactical movement, displaying, in huge close-ups, their faces, their power of vision, the slowly progress of their fingers toward their loaded guns, their worried eyes, their sudden need to be quick, to be the fastest draw...about to collect his vengeance by hanging his former partner...  <br /> <br />The stunning scenes when Leone's camera captures the touching moment in which a young man plays sweet romantic songs on his harmonica, while his eyes are streaming tears of disgrace and grief... <br /> <br />The unforgettable scenes when the 'Stranger' leaving Tuco with a rope around his neck and the bandit begs for mercy while teetering on a wooden cross... <br /> <br />The ultimate confrontation between the forces of good and evil when Leone spreads out long shots adjusting sound with action...

B000G8NXYG|5.0|I've owned the original Criterion version of Seven Samurai.  It was nice owning this fantastic movie, especially since it had the Criterion stamp.  When the new, 3-disc version came out, I read numerous reviews stating how much of an improvement it was from the first edition.  And I am in full agreement.  I've never written a review for Amazon.com before, but I feel compelled because of how impressed I am with these DVDs.  Criterion has really cleaned up this new version.  It blows the older version away.  It looks like it was filmed yesterday.  The extras are really awesome and the booklet is nice and informative.  This is the definitive edition of this wonderful movie and Kurosawa's masterpiece.  Well worth the money.
B000FFJYCU|3.0|I enjoyed the extra features more than the actual movie. The filming of the racing scenes and events was worth the over acting and mediocre plot.

B00005JPBP|5.0|Set mostly in turn of the 19th Century London, THE PRESTIGE is a magical movie about two rival magicians who become engrossed in a lifelong contest of one-upmanship between each that results in death and destruction.  Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Bordon (Christian Bale) are two apprentice magicians who work under the same manager, Mr. Harry Cutter (Michael Caine).  Angier and Bordon are both plants in the audience for a trick for another magician that involves tying his beautiful assistant up and lowering her into a locked huge container of water. The female assistant, Julia (Piper Perabo), also happens to be the wife of Angier.  Bordon has been instructed numerous times to tie the knots on her hands a certain way, but he insists on using a different knot that looks better, but is more difficult to unravel.  After one such performance, Julia is unable to untangle herself and ends up drowning in the tank.  As a result, Cutter, Angier, and Bordon all find themselves out of work and the friendship between Angier and Bordon becomes a hated rivalry.  Angier swears revenge, but after getting it isn't satisfied and goes on to steal one of Bordon's tricks.  Back and forth the rivalry rages.  It leads Angier to Colorado Springs and a meeting with famed inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie).  Eventually, Angier returns to London for the final showdown between the two magicians.  One is an illusionist, the other a true wizard.  So, which witch is which?<br /><br />I found THE PRESTIGE to be an enthralling movie that deserves multiple viewings.  Christopher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, have done an excellent job of adapting Christopher Priest's original novel.  Film is a different medium than a novel and the Nolan's know that well.  The movie is different than the book, but keeps to the spirit of the book, retaining all of the suspense and intrigue of the novel without giving anything away. Christopher Nolan uses some of the same filmmaking storytelling techniques he used in MEMENTO in THE PRESTIGE to keep the audience guessing exactly what is going on.  The Nolan brothers also did a good job of making the characters of Algier and Borden to be both sympathetic and despicable; there are times when you feel compassion towards each of the characters, but what they do in their obsession to out do each other shows everyone just how cold-hearted they really are.<br /><br />Bale and Jackman are at the top of their game as the rival showmen, while Caine gives a solid supporting performance as the man who assists both magicians during their deepest trials.  Piper Perabo doesn't have much screen time, but I felt she was perfect as Julia.  Scarlett Johansson portrays Olivia Wenscombe, the woman that both magicians fall in love with.  Johansson is a very attractive woman and one of the most-in-demand actresses in Hollywood right now.  However, I felt that out of all of the actors in the movie Johansson gives the most lackluster performance.  Olivia has a central (though unwitting) role in the plot, but Johansson seems to have approached it as she does most of her roles, as a vixen who seems more interested in sleeping with different men and breaking up marriages, and doesn't really do much acting.  The surprise performance in this film is that of David Bowie.  Bowie portrays Nikola Tesla.  David Bowie is one of the great rock musicians, but throughout his life he has acted in several different films.  His performance here is the best of his acting career.  I did not recognize Bowie at all and gives a perfect performance as the man who rivaled Edison.<br /><br />THE PRESTIGE doesn't really raise or address any socio-economic questions (though it does touch upon the ultimate science question, just because you can do something does that mean you should do it).  It's not necessarily a deep-thinking movie, though the movie does cause one to think.  It's a very entertaining film that doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't.  It is an incredible movie at what it does do and for that it's one of the best films to be released in 2006.n incredible movie at what it does do and for that it's one of the best films to be released in 2006.
B000002J2F|5.0|I just purchased this version of Duke.  What Genesis likes to call their \\"Definitive Edition Remaster\\". I believe it was manufactured in 1994 by Atlantic/Time Warner, WEA manufacturing.  Most reviews are about the music, which of course is fantastic.  Enough said.  My comments are simply regarding the technical side of the delivery of said music.<br /><br />I, like many other 30 to 40 somethings, have been replacing MANY older original 1987 to 1990 compact disc releases with newer \\"remastered\\" versions.  Many have been a great and welcome necessity.  There are a few that just don't improve on the original.  This is one of those.<br /><br />Duke was one of my earliest cd purchases back in the mid-80's.  As I remember, it was the 5th cd I ever bought.  Mine is a very old Atlantic version (catalog #16014-2) pressed in Japan by JVC.  At a time when there were no disc manufacturing plants in America!  All early cd's were made in Japan or West Germany.<br /><br />After purchasing the newer remastered version, I did a quick comparison of the two.  Output levels were virtually identical.  Surprisingly, my older copy peaked slightly higher during some dynamic sections.  My older disc also seemed to have more bottom-end, and an over-all \\"warmer\\" feel to it.  Kind of like a vinyl record would.  Some other reviewers have commented on the \\"bright\\" or \\"shiny\\" sound of the remaster.  I agree.<br /><br />Many of the older cd's have alot of excessive tape hiss in the background, and remastered versions clean that up significantly.  That is not a problem on Duke.  One reviewer claimed that Duke was \\"digitally\\" recorded.  The sleeve notes do not indicate that in any way.  They only say recorded at Polar Studios Sweden.  Polar Studios may have had some digital recording capabilities, but there were no fully digital, recording, mixing, mastering, available in 1979-80.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have an older original Gensis Duke cd, you may not want to waste any time, effort, or money on replacing it with the definitive edition remaster.  I know I am keeping mine.  If you don't own Duke, you need to.  It's really good.or money on replacing it with the definitive edition remaster.  I know I am keeping mine.

0316172324|5.0|A quick easy read with big ideas and great concepts.  This and Gladwell's Tipping Point should be on all the high school reading lists.  Together, these books would make great graduation gifts.<br /><br />Provides alot of useful insight and forethought.
0316010669|3.0|But, I didn't like tipping point.  Anyway, Gladwell has some interesting points about how we reason and make decisions.  First third of the book shows why we should trust our instincts, next two thirds shows why that's a bad idea.  Not sure what he really believes.  As with Tipping Point he expounds on some intersting social science studies that often but not always have something to do with the point he's trying to make at the time.  The studies are interesting all by themselve, but sometimes I think they're there only to make sure the book has the requisite number of pages.

This is what RAKIM set the stage for and what every MC wants to achieve: commercial status without compromising artistry. This album was born out of the strive for perfection and the utter disregard for public expectations. I bought this album in '97 after hearing so many people say it was the gateway to true hip-hop. They were right. The album is complete and fluid no matter how often you hear it and openly displays the possibilities of a brilliant mind at work. If there were a 10 star rating i would rate Illmatic at that. The album is most likely the most flawless hip-hop record to date and is perfect for those coming to understand rap's lyrical intricacies.
B000058983|5.0|As some here have said: Love was Jim Morrison's favorite band and it was Love's Arthur Lee who convinced Jac Holzman to sign The Doors to Elektra Records. After the Beach Boys swam ashore for a rest and before The Doors would break on through to the other side, there was a magical time in Los Angeles where The Byrds, The Music Machine, Love and The Mothers of Invention ruled the city's airwaves. I saw each of them many times and one night I saw what I still consider to be the ultimate Los Angeles concert line-up: The Byrds (on their \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" tour), Love (touring \\"Forever Changes\\") and Sweetwater, (who had just released their first, self-titled album). It was an amazing night and one I will always be grateful to have been in attendance at. This album, Forever Changes, has now been played so many times that it long ago attained legendary status and generations of listeners now attest to the power, mysticism and beauty of this album. Born out of the heartache and confusion of an Arthur Lee who felt that he would soon die, it addresses topics that few rock albums have ever had the courage or forthrightness to explore. A friend of mine once told me that when he listened to this album he felt that \\"God was talking to me.\\" I smiled when he said that as I had had that same thought more than a few times over the years. But it's not the God of a religious piety so saccharine that it will give you cavities; no, this is the naked and brutal mortality of man wrestling with his fears in the face of a blinding timelessness and scope he cannot understand nor feel comfortable in the presence of. It is at times, frightening and starkly bleak and nihilistic in its view. At other times, it is as hopeful as a butterfly springing with brightly colored wings, fresh from its insular cocoon. But it's always done with a freshness and vitality in the music that was purely Los Angeles and which never happened again, anywhere or anytime else. If I were to cull my thousands of albums down to just a handful, this would be one of them. There are few albums that were ever this good. Love was unique and will always be. I once met Arthur Lee at a hot dog stand in Los Angeles where we were both having lunch. He came up and sat next to me and I looked over and realized who it was and said: \\"Hello, Arthur.\\" He looked back and smiled a very shy smile and said \\"Hello.\\" He was quite friendly though very shy. He was kind. I know from books and comments of ex-band members that he was not always that way but I think his art haunted him and he fought hard for his songs and his craft. The battle within him was never so starkly realized or communicated as it was on this album. Farewell, Arthur, I hope that you found peace, at last.bums down to just a handful, this would be one of them. There are few albums that were ever this good. Love was unique and will always be.

B0009X7664|5.0|Harper Lee's classic novel on acceptance and intolerance was beautifully transformed into a classic film with a performance that placed Gregory Peck permanently in the film pantheon. Additionally the film has Horton Foote's observant script, Elmer Bernstein's finest score and a supporting cast (Brock Peters, Phiip Alford, as examples) all of whom mesh well.  There is, in addition, the glowing Mary Badham as Scout, really the central focus in both book and film, giving what became the performance of a lifetime. If there is anything amiss, it is that the always-excellent Kim Stanley is the uncredited narrator (Scout as a grown up). The film deserves its reputation and has endured the test of time.
B000G03Q2S|5.0|Brian Wilson made a generation of kids look at love lost/love gained/love period, the way they never had before. It really wasn't an \\"age of innocence\\" back in 1966, but it was less complicated than what it would be like in the following decades, having to reconcile issues like E.R.A. amendments, growing tolerance/promotion of homosexuality, H.I.V./AIDS, and, ahem, the preponderance of man-made global warming. SHEESH! Back then we (I was a teenager in 1966) only had love and a war to deal with, beyond getting our school grades up for mom and dad (most of us had both, in the same house back then).<br /><br />So, this work of art was literally outstanding in its field, and those of us who actually listened to it were challenged with our feelings, thoughts, and actions toward this thing that we called LOVE. It was an absolute shame that Capitol Records was spoiled by their cash cow producers (The Beatles and The Beach Boys) and only wanted more of the same stuff that paid their salaries, and yet couldn't see the \\"art\\" part even as it was smacking them in their corporate faces! This album, Pet Sounds, spawned a deeper penetration into mainstream pop music of artistically developed poetry and music. Now we were getting exposed to productions that challenged our senses: abstract forms like \\"MacArthur's Park\\", self-divulgences like \\"17\\" by Laura Nyro, and of course John Lennon's 2 great anthems \\"All You Need Is Love\\" & \\"Give Peace A Chance\\".<br /><br />....all thanks to this work of angst...I mean, ART, by Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys - \\"Pet Sounds\\". And this package is a fine tribute to its existence...with a Bonus DVD too!
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|Without an iota of originality, My Chemical Romance has produced the silliest retread of `The Wall' since, well, `The Wall' itself.  Gerard Way - with his voice so whiningly, nasally emotionless you could throw [insert any whiningly, nasally, emotionless lead singer's name of any pop-punk denizen from Sum 41 to Fall Out Boy to The Used to Panic! At The Disco here] through it - writes ersatz, self-indulgent stream-of-consciousness Junior High School poetry like a teenager immersed in Sylvia Plath too drunk to get into Webster Hall to see Siouxie Sioux open for The Cure so opts out instead to spelunking his older brother's Queen records.  I bet you couldn't find the plot if you searched it with a fine-toothed comb, but according to Wikipedia [proving my unreserved boredom during all the `Screamo' ruckus] \\"the band said that the name \\"The Black Parade\\" was chosen due to a belief that death comes to individuals as their most powerful memory. The main character in the concept went to a parade with his father at a young age, therefore death comes to him as a \\"Black Parade\\".  Uh huh.  MCRs faux-goth/hipster fanbase will cherish this like a new pair of yellow-laced Doc Martens. The rest of us will laugh ourselves until our mascara runs.  My grade:  C-
B00005JL0I|4.0|Charles K. Feldman has great fun with James Bond in a series of mistaken identities, silly pratfalls and numerous sight gags which only Sellers and company could do.  The real James Bond is forced to come out of retirement after the British Secret Service finds itself with too many James Bonds running around, creating havoc around the globe.  Ursula Andress showed what a good sport she was by playing in this silly caper.  It is a great cast, which includes Woody Allen, Orson Welles, William Holden, Deborah Kerr and many others.  Feldman turned the movie into a spoof after a dispute with Broccoli, who refused to underwrite him.  He enlisted the directorial services of John Huston, who also plays M in this madcap adventure.  No doubt the movie served as inspiration for Austin Powers, but I think you will find this version of \\"Casino Royale\\" much more funny, depending on your threshold of tolerance, as it does look a bit dated.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Considered the third in the Great Triumvirate, though Dylan himself never boasted such platitudes, this nearly towers above just about every release this year, in scope and in melody and pure audacity. Folks complain about the croak, as if vocal finesse was ever his forte to begin with - but just to hear each track is to experience his most melodically accessible tunes in years, and his most romantic, poignant.  The deliberate pace allows focus on incantation, as his voice flutters and sloops in its aged, ruthless, coarse delivery. His allusion of Henry Timrod has its detractors, but I want to believe it as homage.  Smart move recording his road band; rarely has Dylan's lyrics swung with such musical pulchritude.  My grade:  A
950491036X|5.0|La Sombra del Viento es una obra maestra de Carlos Ruiz Zafón que me gusta muchísimo!     La novela es muy excitante, dramatica y cautivadora desde la primera pagina hasta el final y eso a pesar de que tiene casi 500 paginas. En mi opinión el libro no es ni un poco aburrido aunque a veces la historia sea muy detallada y aparezcan muchas personas que a final de la cuenta podríamos clasificar como secundarias como por ejemplo la ciega Clara.     Bueno, ¿de que se trata \\"La Sombra del Viento\\"? Ruiz Zafón nos cuenta la historia de Daniel quien busca el paradero de Julián Carax (cara \\"X\\") el muy muy poco conocido escritor del libro \\"La  Sombra del Viento\\" y de Penélope Aldaya, su amante (y no solo eso...). Aparentemente Carax había muerto en París hace algunos anos. Pero algún día una misteriosa persona le habla con Daniel en una calle de Barcelona para que se vende al el el único libro que existe mas en el mundo de \\"La Sombra del Viento\\". ¿Por qué hay una persona que quiere destruir todos los libros de Carax y quien es?  ¿Es el antiguo enemigo de Carax, el inspector Fumero?  ¿O tal vez es Miquel, un hermano de Penélope? ¿ O es alguien completamente inesperado como por ejemplo un tal Laín Coubert, un carácter ficticio del libro?     \\"La Sombra del Viento\\" de Ruiz Zafón es un libro bastante negro, a veces sombrío: se trata de la historia de un amor trágico, de personas muertas. También es un libro que nos describe Barcelona después de la Guerra Civil una era verdaderamente no muy positiva para esta ciudad tan linda. Pero \\"La Sombra del Viento\\" también es un relato sobre el concepto de la amistad. Y de la relación entre padres y sus niños.      Hubo muy pocas cosas que no me gustaban tanto. Una cosa que me irritaba cuando había leído el libro fue que Ruiz Zafón en mi opinión no caracterizó muy bien a Ricardo Aldaya, el padre de Penélope. Él tiene un papel decisiva en el misterio y por eso no entiendo porque no sabemos mas sobre sus motivos y sentimientos cuando .... (lo siento, pero no quiero revelar demasiado).    Otra cosita que no entiendo es ¿porque piensa Ruiz Zafón que Bogota está en Venezuela (y no en Colombia - un error detectado en la carta de Nuria a Daniel)?    A pesar de todo eso es un libro muy bueno y entretenido y te seguro que no vas a deplorar haber comprado (y haber leído por supuesto) \\"La  Sombra del Viento\\".
B00076ZZ9I|5.0|I bought this (finally) as a replacement for the old worn out LP, after giving up that AC/DC will ever be on iTunes. The album speaks for itself as one of the greatest metal albums of all time.<br /><br />But the DVD, though short, is great. I saw both the Bon Scott fronted and Brian Johnson fronted AC/DC at live concerts (yeah, showing my age). The history review, of the long overdue success brought on by the Highway to Hell album, Bon's death from drinking (so they say), and the Back in Black themed album \\"tribute\\" featuring Johnson is well done, though I wish it were longer. Comments by Malcom and Angus are great, it's kinda scary to see Angus looking normal without his schoolboy uniform and back pack.<br /><br />And, it is strangly reassuring to see that Angus' receding hairline matches my own!<br /><br />Highly recommended, and used to continue my 15 year old's education into my world of Rock N Roll.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|After many years of waiting, Kissology is finally out! Being a 15 year old boy who's been a fan for 4 years, I know a lot about Kiss. This 2 disc set is packed with some Kiss footage we've seen and some never before seen! Gene and Paul spent a long time putting this together. Did their hard work pay off? I'd say yes about there are some minuses to this DVD set. To start off, all the footage is from VHS's and remastered. If they're remastered, then what is that I see on the bottom of the screen? During the \\"In Concert\\" videos, the bottom of the screen is going crazy! During the Winterland concerts, it's normal. If this is coming from Gene and Paul's vaults, then this must be why. It's almost like \\"Hey Gene I found a video in the hamper! Let's put on the DVD!\\". There are 4 concerts on here, which show Kiss at their best. I can't wait to see Volumes 2 and 3. Kiss rocks!
B00005JPAD|5.0|The Departed may initially look like your typical cops and robbers suspense, but Scorcese knocks it out of Fenway Park this time round with Boston as its interminably seedy backdrop. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon skillfully hold fast to their southie accents, lending real authenticity to the plot, yet it is Jack Nicholson who steals the performance du jour as the villian extraordinaire. My only criticism is regarding the weak(er) ending, leading me to believe they weren't sure how to do it or pull it off any other way. A Beautifully woven story of two guys trying to make it in the police force; two separate worlds that eventually collide - such brilliant writing makes this so much more than a gansta film. A must see.  <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is a true demonstration of what a band can do. Even every other single alternative/rock/pop/punk bands in the world couldn't touch these guys, they are GODS!!! <br /> <br />American Idiot-A major hit, and several reasons to hate politicians. I saw a commercial for Green Day performing in Boston once, and the words and tune...\\"Don't wanna be an american idiot!\\" Stuck with me until I really discovered what it meant. <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia-This is Billie Joe's personal most favorite song from this, and nothing is able to match up to the variety and power that this song brings along with it. It may be long, but it's absolutely incredible. <br /> <br />Holiday-My favorite song. The opening guitar riff is what rings out in my head all day, inside this solitary confinement cell. And, if anyone asks, the computer is a prop for a CSI scene theyre filming in my cell. <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams-This song is a perfect follow-up to Holiday, even if it's not as good, and the only part you can really rock out to is the instrumental, and that is worth it to rock out to. <br /> <br />Are we the Waiting-This dosen't belong on an album of such high praise. It is a simple fact that it can't match up to the other rock-out songs on American Idiot. Do yourself a favor, download this on to iTunes, or Window Media, or whatever, and take this out, then make a copy of it. <br /> <br />St.Jimmy-My 2nd favorite song. I love how he just screams St.Jimmy during the solo. You are god, Mr.Armstrong. The lyrics rock, and the fact that the guitar and drums go so fast they make you wanna puke is proof that these people are different. <br /> <br />Give me Novacaine-Too slow. If you have the power, try to ignore the actual song and just listen to the chorus and instrumental.It's not that it's bad, it's just that I can't appreciate the song since only 1/4 of it is actually rock. <br /> <br />She's a Rebel-This song is good. Fast, mind-blowing, and lyrics that are so fast they look like St.Jimmy's lyrics. Only tuned down a notch. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl-The title would make you think this song is extraordinary. But it's not. This is and ordinary song played by and extraordinary band. Get over it. Whatshername. <br /> <br />Letterbomb-Awesome. This song is incredibly fast, and the lyrics are totally inaudible. Which is why you should listen to this thing. If you can memorize the lyrics, singing along is great fun. Espescially the taunt of Whatshername-the fink-at the begining. <br /> <br />Wake me up when September ends-This is a very emotionalsong, and the fact they can make something this sad into a rocking piece of modern art, once again, proves their divinity. <br /> <br />Homecoming-One of my favorites. The 1st part and the last part are the best, and the load in the middle is OK. However, Part V's perpetually eternal chant of \\"Home, we're coming hooooooooome agaaaaaaaain\\" get's repetitive after the first 10 times, maybe a dozen times, but by the time it's over, you realize that you should have skipped the chant after the first 15 time, once you were bored stiff. <br /> <br />Whatshername-A good ending, and a spectacular rock attack on the senses in the middle, only it starts slow, but it gets MUCH better. This is a true demonstration of punk power. <br /> <br />12/13-For Are we the Waiting
B000J4QWMC|3.0|I keep hearing that it has nothing to do with the series and doesn't resemble it at all but that's not true.  In fact Mann took several plotlines from the series and used them in the film here.  I even heard a couple spoken lines that I distinctly remember hearing verbatim in the TV series.  My gut reaction to this film was disappointment but on reflection I get what Mann was trying to do.  He made a film that almost acts like an \\"episode\\" of a series and in hind site it works.  Ferrell does a great job and really carries the movie but Foxx really seems like he did very little to research his character's personality and really seems like he has nothing to do except play off Ferrell and fly the plane at one point.  Gong li is ok but It seems like they hired her because of who she is not her English speaking acting ability and as a result I never really felt a strong connection to her relationship with Crockett, which I think is why I was really disappointed with the film at first. The relationship between Li's character and Crockett is what the tension in the film tries to build on but I just fell flat for me because I didn't really feel it.  That aside it is an interesting and noteworthy film and you should give it a chance.
B000FIMG68|5.0|As good as the first season, a must for Lost fans
B000007SPT|4.0|He obviously hasn't listened to enough music to know what is good and what is bad.  I listened to this album (now cd) recently and it still holds up.  Timn Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren\\" is one of the most beautiful songs that I have ever heard; Elizabeth Fraser's cover hits it so hard if you don't get it then you cannot feel much.  I could go on.  See Kelly Garret's accurate review.  I just had to chime in b/c somehow this Jon Stone's parent's left the computer on and the Playskool keyboard connected so their very little son typed out garbage that required a response.  I listen to everything - classical, jazz, soul, funk, reggae, dub, punk, bluegrass, and on and on -  this cd still kicks.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|This is going to sound like an exaggeration...but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br />I will admit that I didn't have high hopes for this film.  I mean, it didn't come out in theaters (at least in the U.S.), which is never a good sign, no movie store seems to have it in stock, and I read some pretty crippling reviews right here on good ol' Amazon.  But hey, I gave it a shot.  Boy, was that a mistake... <br /> <br />First of all, here's a quick synopsis: Years ago, King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard) killed a troll, but took pity on the troll's son, Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson), and left him alone.  Grendel, now full-grown, is seeking revenge on Hrothgar's kingdom.  Hearing of Hrothgar's plight, the fierce warrior Beowulf (Gerard Butler) comes to help the king kill Grendel.  Along the way Beowulf meets a witch/prostitute named Selma (Sarah Polley) and discovers that trolls have feelings too. <br /> <br />Now, we all know that Stellan Skarsgard and Gerard Butler are great actors, but in this movie they fumble with a halting and painfully corny script.  The script affects the acting, and the acting affects the film. <br /> <br />Secondly, though Sarah Polley is a lovely actress, she seems very misplaced in this film.  She's the ONLY character with an American accent and, in an age-old Anglo-Saxon myth, this is very, very out of place.  In addition, the small amount of weight that Gerard Butler has put on around the stomach area draws a little from his role as an unstoppable, highly-trained warrior. <br /> <br />The battle scenes are unnecessarily gory, with fake-looking and very blood-soaked limbs flying left and right.  They seem primitive compared to the battle scenes of other films.  The scene in which Beowulf fights Grendel's mother is especially bad - there's lots of shrieking and strobe-light-esque movements that seem almost comical in this day and age. <br /> <br />The only things that can be said in this movie's defense are that the sweeping Iceland landscapes are breathtaking and the Celtic monk (Eddie Marsan) is mildly-amusing in his efforts to convert everyone. <br /> <br />1-star...please don't waste 103 minutes of your life on this film.
B00000AOUD|5.0|What more can I say? ( Okay, I will say a bit more...) This is my all-time favorite piece of rock music. Even better than The Who's masterpiece Tommy. A masterful composition musically and lyically by Ian Anderson, and his then-bandmates of Martin Barre ( the only one still playing with Anderson in what is still being called \\"Jethro Tull\\") John Evan, Jeffery Hammond and Barriemore Barlow brought the whole thing to life in one breathtaking two-sided ( back when it first came out on LP ) 45-minute song that still brings chills up and down my spine. I saw Tull only once in my life, and it was the 1972 tour when they played the entirety of this album - and then some, extending the 45 minutes into an over two-hour performance. What a show! I still have my original album of this, and the new remastered CD is phenomenal. Who engineered this thing? Crisp and clear and RICH sounding! And who has ever given enough credit to keyboard player John Evan on it? Man, his Hammond just rolls all the way through this song, dominating the soundscape much more than the guitar playing of Barre ( whose playing is of course superb nonetheless ). And with old friend Barriemore Barlow becoming Tull's new drummer on this album all the pieces were finally in place for the best and most fruitful lineup Jethro Tull ever had. All these guys were the best rock musicians of their time. It's too bad that Ian, Martin and a bunch of stand-ins still go around calling themselves Jethro Tull. In my mind Jethro Tull was Ian Anderson, Martin Barre, Jeffery Hammond-Hammond, John Evan and Barriemore Barlow - period. And their undisputed masterpiece was Thick As A Brick.<br /><br />The extras here are an edited live version of Brick and an interview/discussion featuring Ian, Martin and Jeffery. I really enjoyed their conversation, recalling the creating, recording and performing of Brick, with all the Python-esque theatrics on stage. And the live recording sounds good, okay I guess. But it is only 12 minutes long, and it was done in 1978, after Jeffery Hammond had retired from the music business to return to his true love, painting. So there was some other guy playing Jeffery's bass parts. Too bad there isn't any live recording of the entire song with the lineup of the band that created it in the first place. In any case, this is THE album of the progressive 70s for me, besting even Dark Side of the Moon and Saturday Night Fever ( just kidding on that one!) So a life-long thank-you to the lads for this great music!, and it was done in 1978, after Jeffery Hammond had retired from the music business to return to his true love, painting.

B000053VAZ|5.0|My comments might be predjudice by the fact that I like most movies that Johanny Depp has made.  The movie is sensitive and hopeful as well as very entertaining and funny.
B00005JOHC|4.0|Here in Norway we have Two and a half men on one of the comercial channels, so you'd think it fits really well, being american and all. However, I think it goes against the grain quite a bit. Very few if any of the people in this sit-com are in any real sense of the word; \\"good people\\". Charlie Sheen (Platoon) plays Charlie Harper, a fornicator of grandiose proportions, he has a given talent, but squanders it on the easy buck. Jon Cryer (No Small Affair) is Alan, a character weak at best, his only real strong trait his love for his son. The brothers mother (Holland Taylor) is deplorable on most occations, Alans former wife Judith (Marin Hinkle) is all business and neuroses. Our titular half man, Jake (Angus Jones), is a dunce, and not your lovable, smart mouthed, wise beyond his years, kind of kid most US sitcoms are filled to the brim with. The neighbour, Rose (Melanie Lynskey, Heavenly Creatures) is sweet, but may or may not be borderline dangerous.<br /><br />Despite all of this you got to love these flawed people, and that's probably why this is a success. As much as we loved Ross, Chandler, Monica, Rachel and all the rest out there, perfect gets boring.<br /><br />Then there's the big crunch, this is sidesplittingly funny!<br /><br />In Norway you can watch Two and a half Men as well as My Name is Earl on the same day. Talk about a perfect pairing of flawed people.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Honestly, I didn't want to like it. When I saw all of the marketing and posters for the movie I thought Brandon Routh was going to be an absolute disaster. Boy, was I wrong. I didn't see it in the theaters for several weeks after release because I was so adamant about not liking it. But I eventually came around to seeing it and was pleasantly surprised. I thought Routh and director Bryan Singer did a good job with this. I found myself really liking the movie. I didn't think anyone could follow the iconic Christopher Reeve in this role. And I was kind of sad that studio executives thought that he could be replaced so easily, that people were just going to forget about him and embrace whatever they threw up on the screen. It's only been two years since his death, so I though it was somewhat insulating to even consider bringing this movie back without him. But Routh did an admirable job. He was convincing. But I think a lot will hinge on the movies that follow as to whether or not this new remake franchise sinks or swims. I thought the beginning of the film was somewhat confusing, but once it got going it was very good. I thought Kevin Spacey was a good choice as Lex Luthor and Parker Posey is always great. So it will be interesting to see the film that follows. The real question is whether Singer can really build and expand upon this one and get those that were on the fringe before into the theater? I would encourage people that were hesitant to see this in the theater to at least give it a chance. This was challenging from the beginning with the soaring production costs and just dealing with the whole legacy that Reeve left behind. It was brave to remake this series so soon and some would probably argue somewhat foolish. But in all, this was a very enjoyable movie. I think if people go in with an open mild they'll like it.
0743298020|5.0|This was one of the best books that I have read in AGES! I plan to purchase copies as the PERFECT Christmas gift to get someone through the cold dark days of winter.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|third cd from this group is just as good as the other 2.  received in short period of time after purchase in excellent condition.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This release is a solid one.  Riffs, solos, and lyrics are top notch.  What I also like about this album is that the drums are really present upfront.  They're louder, with more fills, reminiscent of early Maiden, which to me is the backbone of this music.  Though an excellent CD, to me personally, it isn't a landmark one such as \\"Fear of the Dark\\", which captured my interest from the first listen.  I had to listen to Matter of Life & Death a few times before I wrote this review.<br /><br />There are two things that I feel may have enhanced the album further: First, the distortion level, which doesn't sound as tight as their 90s releases.  Second, there is a lack of \\"punch\\" when the solos kick in on some of the songs.  Both these have more to do with sound engineering and studio mixing rather than the music itself.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is a historically important film in both the SF genre and in film itself.  It is certainly one of the best examples of what CAN be done when a little effort is put into a project, both in terms of the story execution, and the ideas that lay the foundation for the afterthoughts that the viewer takes away.<br /><br />Witness the incredible depictions of the remaining Krell artifacts, the idea of the \\"plastic educator\\", the \\"brain booster\\", etc.  Marvel at the beautiful set pieces.  To be sure, they aren't \\"realistic\\" but, as another reviewer points out, they are \\"dreamlike\\", and they add another dimension of fantasy to the atmosphere.<br /><br />Overall, just enjoy this great classic for what it is - thought provoking, intelligent, and fun.  All ages will enjoy.
B000I5X81K|5.0|So ... I was getting in a friend's car a few years ago, and he had all these CD's on floor.  I was like, who is this guy, what are these CD's about?  He said it was Josh Groban -- some dude that his mom liked -- and that he made copies for her friends and had a few extras leftover.  I was offered one and accepted it, not expecting anything really.   <br /> <br />I even think it was another month before I finally slipped it in the CD player with nothing else better to listen to.  BAM!  From the start of track 1, I was sucked in to the soothing, beautiful world of Josh-Groban-music.  We became fast friends, that CD and I (that CD being Closer), and it didn't take long before I introduced my mom.  She never, to this day, gave it back.  It's probably worn out by now anyway. <br /> <br />So although no music expert, I don't even pretend to know everything about Mr. Groban or his music.  However.  I can tell you that this man has a phenomenal voice and his music is the kind to give you chills (if you're into that sorta thing).  And if you are ... Awake is no exception!  Lullaby (#11) makes me actually WANT to sing to my baby (although that doesn't mean she wants to hear it.  I'm sure she prefers Josh's version).   <br /> <br />Needless to say, I am captivated.  I love almost all of the songs (a rarity for a CD these days) -- February Song being another contender for \\"favorite.\\"  It takes me hours to get to the next song because the previous is on repeat.  That's how much I love it. <br /> <br />The moral of the story: even if you've never heard of the guy, and you're out for some sweet instrumentals and a powerful voice -- this is your CD.  It's worth it, all the way.  You gotta start somewhere, and Awake is a great place to start. <br /> <br />And one thing's for sure ... I am NOT loaning this CD to my mom.
1932100385|5.0|As I see it, this is about the most important book you will ever read about health. Campbell makes the case for a healthy diet/lifestyle that is vastly different than the typical American diet, but one that is not strange in many other populations.    Take this book seriously and consider the arguments and evidence presented. Campbell has blue ribbon credentials and has spent his life working in the field. I would totally disregard the negative replies being posted by someone calling himself JayY. He seems to be the definition of someone with a hidden agenda.    Why would someone go out of his/her way to attack every recent favorable opinion of the book? Is that someone so concerned about my health that they are compelled to warn all of us one by one? I think not. Lets face it, this book makes an argument that powerful interests would rather not have on the table. It has the potential to devastate the multi-billion dollar corporate controlled agribusiness and food processing industries. Make no mistake, there is strong opposition based on both a profit motive and certain kinds of cultural and scientific bias. Part IV of the book examines this topic.
0618680004|4.0|Most of the criticism against Dawkins and this book is based on one or both of the following assumptions: (1) Atheists are full of hatred and have no business telling people that their religious beliefs are irrational, (2) Dawkins is a biologist, not a theologian, so he shouldn't write a book about religion. As for (1), Dawkins is a scientist, concerned with the truth, and he has all the right in the world to point out the irrationality of theism, because (2) being a scientist, Dawkins realizes that religious claims deserve to be examined the same way you would examine any hypothesis. As a scientist, he wants to get a better understanding of the human nature, human behavious and human beliefs. He doesn't subscribe to the faulty notion that only theologians and apologists are qualified to examine the claims that religions make.  <br /> <br />In chapters 3 and 4, Dawkins deals with some of the common arguments for God's existence, such as the argument for design. He explains some of the basic flaws in the \\"Intelligent design\\" theory (for example,that the alternative to design is not \\"chance\\", but natural selection). But believers don't need to go into defense mode. Unlike some have suggested, Dawkins doesn't resort to namecalling and say that religious people are stupid. He uses his scientific knowledge to try to understand religious belief. His most interesting hypothesis is that religion is a by-product of something else. In the end of the book, he explains how the atheistic world view is far from as cynical and tragic as believers often suggest. He also examines the claim that all morals must come from religion. These are the most interesting parts of the book. There are some parts that slow down the overall pace and keep me from giving the book a five star rating, but \\"The God Delusion\\" is definately a book that should be read by both theists and atheists. It is, to use an expression that Dawkins uses throughout the book, a \\"consciousness raiser\\".
B000HCO840|3.0|You would be hard pressed to find a bigger X-men fan. I think the X-men is the richest of all the comic book superhero collections, when it comes to stories, characters and possibilities. Spiderman's the coolest, but X-men has numerous characters that deal with real issues that coincide with issues of the world... like mutantism/racism, fear of the unknown and stereotyping.<br /><br />So, now we have X-men: THE LAST STAND. What? Last stand?<br /><br />The first two X-men movies were outstanding, yet only scratching the surface of the stories that are to be told in the comic book series and its possibilities. The third and supposedly, FINAL film, couldn't possibly do the series justice if it ended the series now. I mean, what about APOCALYPSE, JUGGERNAUT, BLACK TOM, ERIC THE RED, the FOUR HORSEMEN, GAUNTLET, the HELLFIRE CLUB, STRYFE and the Mutant Liberation Front and of course the Sentinels.<br /><br />So, what did the creators of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND do? I'm still not sure. They took, what was the PHOENIX SAGA, or when Jean Grey returns from the dead as an even more powerful Mutant than she was, struggling to control her powers. They took the Phoenix Saga, rewrote it, and hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Ultimately, we do get to see the Sentinels... for about 15 seconds. Their eyes shining through fog and one of their heads dropping to the ground... only to turn out being a simulator. Then we do get to meet JUGGERNAUT... again, seemingly just thrown in and not given any meaningful air time. We get to meet a bunch of random Mutants, seemingly created by the writers. None of which are of any note. Oh, and of course we get to see ANGEL in some brief scenes... dives out a window and flies away and then appears in the final scene briefly. Colossus, vaguely used. Again, all these cool characters... just basically given a reference and not explored.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot about the introduction of BEAST, played by Kelsey Grammar. He does a great job, but again, just a, \\"Here's Beast, shows over folks.\\"<br /><br />So, why are they in such a hurry to END THE MOST SUCCESSFUL comic book TRILOGY of all time?

B000BW7QWW|5.0|When they say this is an action film it is absolutely true. Most action films have a hero and that's a problem in this flic. Even the villian was heroic in the end. It is a rousing good time with many suprises and well worth viewing...several times.
B000063DIH|2.0|With so many good to absolutly superb albums in Maiden's catalog, it was somewhat of a shocker that Maiden pretty much laid an egg on this album. \\"Seventh Son of the Seventh Son\\" and \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\" werent in the same class of \\"Number of the Beast\\" and \\"Somewhere in Time\\" but still solid albums. \\"Fear of the Dark\\" is a strange album from Maiden, as it seems riddled with songs shifting from real knockouts such as \\"Be quick or be dead\\" and \\"fear of the dark\\" to boring, slow and un-Maiden like \\"Wasting Love\\" and \\"Chains of Misery\\". In fact, out of the tweleve tracks here, I only like six of them, and thats a disaster for a Maiden album, when on most Maiden albums, I usually dont skip over tracks, or maybe just one. But six awful songs is to much for a great progressive Metal band like Maiden (yes I said Progressive Metal, Maiden isnt Hair, Power, or Arena Metal, thank you). The only other Maiden album that is this bad out of their entire catalog was \\"x Factor\\" with the un-listenble Blaze Baily. Maybe some think that having a singer that sounds exactly like the past vocalist is fine (Ripper Ownes anyone from Priest) but I think its a disgrace. Thankfully Bruce would return to Maiden, and make some solid albums, but if you really are looking for more of an older sounding, more Progressive type of Maiden, then please check out Bruce'solo albums \\"Chemical Wedding\\" & the amazing masterpiece \\"Tyranny of Souls\\"

B000063DIR|1.0|....and you thought the butchring of Blizzard of Oz was bad?? At least some of the songs have a similar format to the originals(on Blizzard) Even though it still sucks, its no where near as noticable as this mess. Wait, just wait until you hear how butchred \\"Over the Mountain\\", and \\"Flying High\\" . I didnt even make it past those, as I had enough of listening to the samples. It sounds like a bunch of 12yr old kids jammin in a basement with a tape of a guitarist (Randy) in the background. What a damn disgrace to butcher an album, and even more so that Randy is gone. Ozzy is a disgrace, and I was so happy for him when he landed his show on MTV and his Oz fest concerts were doing so well. I thought all the years of hard work, having to deal with the death of Randy, and suffering through addictions, it seemed like all was well and he hit it big time. Now, I wish the success have never happened, because it seemed to go straight to his head. I am so sick and tired of the music industry these days, and it seems like even the musicans of old, that we thought never would sell out, are still out to make a buck, and this all because of a fued on something that was recorded 25yrs ago. It is Now a reality that Ozzy is greedy, and so what if he had to hand over a couple of Million to keep the disgruntled band members happy. At least he should have thought of Randy, and what his thoughts would have been of this butchery. I hope he is happy. We all know the drugs and booze did damage to his brain, but now I think he has none left. BAN OZZY.>>SELLOUT!!!!
B000001Y2U|5.0|Originally, I bought this album because of the controversy.  I was in full \\"support the artist\\" mode.  Now, I've gotten burned by the \\"support the artist\\" many times with really bad rap music (2 Live Crew, MC Eiht), shock jocks (Howard Stern), and occasionally funny but not groundbreaking comics (Andrew Dice Clay).  None of them had any real artistic inclinations.  They were scam artists making money.  The support the artist game is used as a marketing ploy.  Not here.  Manson is the real thing.  I still play this CD.  I really dig this CD.  I remember a high school chum of mine looked at me like I was insane when I got this.  I was 28 when I got it, he was the same age.  He was becoming Mr. Domestic, I'm still an insane artistic type.  We parted ways, amicably.  Anyway, this is one of Manson's best, along with Holy Wood and Mechanical Animals.  I love the cover art.  The best songs are 1996, Dried Up and Dead to the World, and Irresponsible Hate Anthem (which is quite responsible, actually).  Manson is a really intelligent, gifted musician.  He dresses a little differently, but what's inside that counts....
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green Day is the most over-rated band that is in modern music. Here is the main reason that I get so angered by fans of Green Day. For some reason, some Green Day fan comes writes a review for a Metal album, and says Green Day is so much better, or this is music junk, Billy Joe or is a much better singer. SO know its my turn to tell it like it is. Green Day isnt that good, as its grown men that still act like boys and wear makeup, since half their listeners are in the 13-18 age range.Its OK to listen to what you want to, but please stop praising this band as musical gods. If you like them, thats great, but a couple so simple guitar riffs and some la de da singing dont impress me enough to put them as musical Gods. I will give them credit. They survived the Grunge age and are still going strong, as most bands during that era have faded into obscurity. If you are looking for some music that is Green Day type, go out and get some Clash, Ramones, or Sex Pistols. Its a lot deeper, less poppy, and stood for something. It also had alot more creativity, as most punk bands from the 70's and 80's were, since the musical genere was new, and the bands that I mentioned created it.
B000002JSJ|3.0|Many fans really adore this album, saying it's Zep's most underrated and many think it's a masterpiece.  As a Zep fan, I don't fall into this category.  I think people got it right the first time with this album in that it's generally a disappointment, but it's not a disaster.  It's a stripped down album for sure, with very few overdubs (at least my ear felt that way), and pretty straightfoward compared to Zep's earlier work.  There are several great songs here.  The opener Achilles' Last Stand really rocks, with a rather tricky time signature for Bonzo (John Bonham wasn't always about sledgehammer beats...he could play intricate stuff if need be).  Tea for One is a slow burn blues, with a weary, tired, yet powerful and moving vocal by Plant and searing guitar work by Page.  It has a world weary vibe to it which I really dig.  It's a perfect song for a dead, rain soaked afternoon.  For Your Life is a personal favorite.  It also has the same world weariness as Tea for One, and it works very well.  The other songs I don't really care for that much.<br /><br />Overall, this album is not a lost masterpice, but it isn't complete garbage either.  It's worth picking up for Zep fans, and despite being subpar for Zeppelin, it's still above most contemporary artists' best work.
074325144X|5.0|A few months ago, I came across an article about Chi-running and got very intrigued by this new method as I just started my training for my first Marathon. And I ought to give credit to the Chi-running method for helping me run my first marathon in Chicago on Oct. 22, 2006 injury-free!!! Even better, I had my personal pace record 8:15/mile.  <br /> <br />It definitely worked well for me. I am now addictive to distance running and getting myself ready for St. Louis marathon in 2007. I don't guaranttee this would work for you, but it definitely worth trying.
B000002H4C|5.0|i remember the magazines as a 13 & 14 yer old in the early 80's and wanting to see the movie. being a catholic school boy, it ws sort of frowned upon. but, my grandmother bought me the soundtrack anyway. and i thought it was the greatest movie soundtrack ever. it was a 2 album set and I still have it. i hadn't heard it for at least 15 yearsuntil i brought out my old albums and record player. HEAVY METAL was the first I listened to. the music hasn't aged and they're still great--evern after all these years. Don Felder's songs, as well as devo's and donald fagan's track, still stand out. and excellent selection of songs to a truly classic animated film. an album not to be missed.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|Chiwetel Ejiofor delivers an absurdly wondrous performance as a transvestite with attitude and style in this charming story about a failing nineteenth century shoe factory in Northampton, England which turns its staid wingtip oriented craftsmanship into a style house for outrageous footwear. The movie has the feel of THE FULL MONTY, but I liked it better, because there's more of a sense of style, the music is terrific and Ejiofor is electrifying as Lola, the star of any show.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|As a fifty year old man who thought all my favorite CDs came out 20 or more years ago (with the exception of Jagged Little Pill) was shocked on first listen to find this one of the most consistently enjoying melodic but rocking albums I have heard in a long long time.  I read the raves and walked in expecting to be diappointed.  Far from it.  I will put this immediately on top of my personal list as BEST album of 2006 and as one of the best albums of the millenium.  Furthermore, I expect it to enter my pantheon of all time favorites.
B000002OTL|4.0|All of the music is lovely, and segments of dialogues are included directly from the movie which is both awesome and a disadvantage. Primarily because there is cursing (specifically in the opening segment) which may limit the audiences you'll play the CD for, but if that isn't a concern then there's no other fault to be found.
B00005JKHP|3.0|Of all the Trek films to tinker with, it had to be this one! If you look at the six films with the \\"classic\\" cast, Star Trek V is the one that leaps out as needing the most help, so why tinker with the first film? I shouldn't complain about Bob Wise getting a chance at a finished cut of the film, but they should have kept the computer geeks away from it. The few added scenes of the CGI Enterprise are tolerable, but the shots of Vulcan look more like screenshots from a video game than scenes from a major motion picture. Since this first Trek film seems the most dismissed by the general public, I suppose Paramount figured that fussing with it could only improve it. In the end, they really only succeded in annoying the small group of us that loved the film in the first place and would have been happy to shell out for a (digitally mastered) NON-Special Edition.

031236198X|1.0|I've enjoyed John Kotter's work in the past. I've found his work useful and effective. However I learned nothing new from this book. The story line is poor and the approach outlined in the narrative to effective change management does not provide any better or new approach. <br /> <br />I'd suggest Stephen Denning's books on business narrative (eg the Springboard) for those who are looking for a narrative-based or alternative approach to facilitate change.

B000I5X81K|5.0|I have been a huge Josh fan since the beginning. Therefore, you can imagine how highly I had been anticipating this cd. As soon as it arrived (I ordered the special cd/dvd edition... definitely worth the extra mula!) I popped it into my cd player and it has not left it since! At first,I thought some of the songs were not up to par, but the more I listened the more I loved it. It was the same way with Closer, Josh's 2nd cd, for me. I didn't exactly fall in love with it the first time I listened to it. But now, that is one of the few cds I have where all the songs are, to me, far above excellent. Awake is no exception. While Josh did venture away from his typical style, I don't think it has hurt him. In fact, I actually like the funky beat to \\"Machine\\" and the tender \\"Lullaby\\". While adding this new stuff, Josh has still incorporated some true \\"Joshy\\" songs such as \\"February Song\\" and \\"Solo Por Ti\\". This cd shows more of Josh's talent. He has vocally matured and these songs show off his superb voice. The songs have more high parts which show Josh's amazing range. Overall, I highly recommend this AMAZING cd. The new stuff may be more appealing to newcomers and for previous Josh fans, this is a must buy. I would highly recommend spending the extra money to get the special edition cd/dvd set because the bonus tracks and 30 minute dvd make it well worth the purchase.  If I had to choose favorites they would be: \\"In Her Eyes\\", Un Giorno Per Noi\\", \\"February Song\\" and \\"Verite\\"(on the special edition). But all of them are awesome!

0446528056|5.0|When I first read what Dear John was about I was not sure I would like it, but I loved it! I could not put it down. I think some of the best parts of Dear John are seeing John's relationship with his father grow after so many years of being angry with his father. I would recommend this book to anyone, Nicholas Sparks has really shown that he can do more than just your typical love story.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has entered the realm in which only a few authors live... the realm of \\"Re-read books by Jason\\".  It's not a realm that anyone else would know or ever CARE about but that is un-important!  '  I re-read this book for one reason and one reason only... it's one heck of a story!!  I DO NOT think Jesus and Mary were married and I DO NOT think that Jesus had a child running around like a reject from the Maury Povich show.  My faith is strong and nothing that a fictional writer puts to paper will change my mind.  Nothing.<br /><br />I can suspend my belief when reading a FICTIONAL book and that is exactly what I did with this FICTIONAL book.  I don't need to do a \\"review\\" because it's been reviewed almost 4,000 times; I'm just going to tell you how much I love this story.  The action is non-stop even when Dan had to explain the different symbols and histories; he found a way to keep it flowing and fun.  One example:  who knew that the initials \\"P.S\\" had so many different meanings and that they ALL make sense?<br /><br />I hear people say all the time \\"I could not stop reading this book\\", \\"I could not put this book down\\".  It's said so much that it's almost become clich&eacute;.  I'll just say if you aren't a read-a-book-in-one-sitting-person... you will be once you start this novel!  For me this book was pure magic.  Magic because it was a book that I hated to leave and hated to see end.  Magic because I loved going on a mini scavenger hunt looking for the clues that Dan Brown sets out.  The first time I read this book I had a desktop computer that I had to run to in order to see the `Mona Lisa', `The Last Supper', `Madonna of the Rocks', and other art that Dan references.  This time around I had an iPhone.  Hehehehe!!<br /><br />Part of the fun I had was looking at these works of art and checking to see if I saw what he saw (I didn't most of the time) but it's still nice to \\"play\\" along.  I would suggest that you get the illustrated version if you can.  Forget everything you've heard good and bad, about this book.  Get one for yourself!  If you're looking for a fun, escapist, mind bending, conversations starting, stay up till 2 AM book, then get this one.  If you want the truth... read the Bible.and bad, about this book.

B0009R1T7M|3.0|My initial reaction upon hearing the first few bars of the first track of Illinois was, what on earth is this? It wasn't a favourable impression and I immediately replaced the disc with another one. It took me a few days to pluck up the courage to give it another chance and I am very glad that I did. Illinois, my introduction to Surjan Stevens, definitively takes a few listens to really appreciate, and it improves with every listen. In fact, at a certain point, I found myself playing it over and over again, even though some of the tracks have continued to make me cringe. It is almost because they are quite strange, mainly because I am not very familiar with this kind of music, that they impel another listen. For me, two tracks on this CD really stand out: Come on feel the Illinoise and the quite superb Jacksonville. For the rest, I will continue to play it and it will undoubtedly become increasingly seductive. And I have definitely heard enough to interest me in listening to the rest of Mr. Steven's oeuvre.
B00004OCRN|3.0|Though its original release was meant to be a promotional EP for the \\"Human Rights Now!\\" Tour, of which Bruce and the E Streeters were a part of, we in 2006 can simply look upon it as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band on tour circa late-80s. <br /> <br />In my opinion, the music is so-so and could've relied a little less on the synthesizer effects. <br /> <br />The \\"average\\" feel is nowhere to be seen, though, when Bruce performs \\"Born to Run\\" with nothing more than an acoustic guitar and harmonica.  With the rock-n-roll version gone, we truly hear the lyrics in a completely different fashion, which, I think, serves as proof of Bruce's musical and lyrical talent. <br /> <br />So, is it worth buying to hear an acoustic version of \\"Born to Run\\" (and a very moving version, at that)?  Some would say \\"Definetely\\", others would say \\"No.\\" <br /> <br />I myself purchased the EP from a local music-store.  Do I regret buying it, even if I only liked \\"BTR\\"?  No?  If I'd known I could download this version of \\"BTR\\" from the Internet, would I?  Yes.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|What DVD collection could be complete without the complete series collection of Friends.  This is one of the finest sitcoms in the history of television.  Thursday nights on NBC was \\"event\\" television before shows like 24 made people stay at home and plan their nights around an episode.<br /><br />From the first show through the last, the ensemble cast was truly top rate.  I can watch these shows again and again.  We all have our favorites, some of which are laugh out loud funny on the 10th go around.  I don't care if the series is available in 10 different versions, much like books.  The content is the same whichever the packaging.  And in the case of Friends... the packaging is excellent.
B00005AFVR|5.0|Say what you want about Bruce \\"getting old\\", but I strongly believe that this album (which showcases Bruce in his late-40s/early-50s) puts many rockers half-his-age to shame. <br /> <br />All the songs are great, especially the ones that are re-arranged, such as \\"The River.\\"  For a special treat, Bruce throws in the rarity, \\"Don't Look Back.\\"   <br /> <br />And yet, of all the songs on this live album, I believe the most impressive is Bruce's acoustic version of \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", where Bruce plays an acoustic 12-string.  For those of you who have Tracks, but not this, trust me when I say LINYC's version of \\"BITUSA\\" makes Tracks' acoustic version look like nothing. <br /> <br />ONE WARNING: Though I personally have no qualms about the song-selections, some of you who want to hear the \\"staples\\" (i.e. \\"The Promised Land\\") might be dissapointed.  And yet, when it comes to preferences of Bruce-fans, the term \\"to each his own\\" is definetely applicable. <br /> <br />Is it an extensive treasure-trove of live performances a la Live 1975-1985?  No.  Is it worth it nonetheless?  Yes.
B00002E23E|4.0|The Song Remains The Same is Led Zep at their early (1973) in concert best.

B000E41MS6|3.0|I've been a Doctor Who fan since the 1970s and was delighted when I heard the series was being revived. I was feeling pretty pleased for the first few episodes - the show had been updated, the effects were better, and the Shakespere-style acting of yesteryear was gone. The new Doctor was also a nice change, demonstrating that the character can be variable enough to go from being an aristocrat (Jon Pertwee) to somebody's goofy handyman uncle (Christopher Eccleston. It also helped that two of my favourite old enemies - the Autons and the Daleks - reappeared in this series. The Daleks, in particularly, were really nicely revamped and actually seemed scary (though more through their actions than their appearance). HOWEVER, I noticed a lot of problems with the new series that I believe - once all the hype and backslapping about the series dies down - will start to work against it. These are:<br /><br />1. CLIMAX-RESOLUTION: Probably the biggest problem. Each episode has a fast paced plot... until the end. Then, quite noticeably, the story runs out of puff. It's as if the writer (especially Russel T. Davies) suddenly realises that the story is supposed to end now and he hasn't worked out how to do it. For this reason, the climax of most of the stories seems like a tacked-on, half-hearted effort (e.g., \\"Parting Of The Ways\\"). Typically we get to see a brief struggle between the Doctor and the villain/problem, followed by an almost instantaneous victory. The victory is rarely due to the intelligence of the characters, and usually involves pure luck or a really simple solution that takes a couple of seconds to complete. Even worse is when the solution is an utterly implausible cop-out like the one we see in the final episode. There is almost no dramatic tension toward the end of each episode and no sense of concern that the Doctor might not win. Rather, we just get to sit and wait for the next easy solution to pop up.<br /><br />2. EASY ENEMIES: The villains the Doctor encounters in this series are typically pretty fearsome - until it comes time to actually face them. Then they go down in a heap without any fight at all. We first see this with the Autons, being defeated within seconds with a simplistic gimmick. I spent most of the series thinking \\"Gee that was easy. Why were they so worried?\\" At least the Daleks got to do a bit of damage until their ultimately ridiculous defeat. It's when you realise they've been defeated in such a pathetic way that you might start wondering \\"Did the writer actually put any thought into this story?\\" The old series had its flaws, but it never came up with extreme grasping-at-straws style solutions.<br /><br />3. ROSE: I got the impression that the writers were trying to shove the Doctor's new companion down our throats every chance they got (most of the series centred on her). There's never been a companion in the series that has been as over-hyped as Billie Piper's Rose Tyler. Old fashioned as I am, I liked it when the Doctor's companions had a bit of class, or if they lacked it, at least had intelligence. The character of Rose is certainly not intelligent and is about as classy as Roseanne Barr. It doesn't help that she speaks like she failed the fourth grade, and can't seem to say the letter \\"r\\" without turning it into a \\"w.\\" In the episode with the flatulent aliens, I kept wondering when she was going to join in, or at least ask the Doctor to pull her finger.<br /><br />4. AWFUL COMPANIONS: The additional \\"companions\\" also aren't great. Rose's mother Jackie is even less classy than Rose and can't seem to say anything without throwing a fit. Rose's boyfriend Mickey is a major loser who seems to be in the show as both the comic relief and the \\"token black guy.\\" The biggest letdown was Captain Jack, supposedly a swashbuckler-type character (although we never really see this), whose main claim to fame (and apparently the only thing about him that the writers considered significant) is that he is gay. Wow. In the classic series, the companions used to have a bit more to them than this lot does.<br /><br />5. EARTH: For some unfathomable reason, the writers of the show decided to confine almost every episode to Earth or a satellite close to it. It's as if they aren't able to think beyond a London or Earth setting. Confining the series to one planet is a big mistake and it's going to get boring fast.<br /><br />6. DUMBING IT DOWN: I had the sense that the show had been dumbed down as much as possible in order to make it appeal to a bigger audience. I know they wanted the show to have the best chance it could, but this kind of display just smacks of selling out to me. The old series worked with all its high scientific concepts, regardless of the fact that none of us really understood them.<br /><br />7. CHEESY MELODRAMATIC MUSIC: The music is either \\"stirring music\\" for the emotive scenes (sounding like the soundtrack of a bad 60s romance movie) or \\"spooky music\\" (which sounds like Enya doing a warm up) for supposedly deep scenes.<br /><br />8. MORE WILL-THEY-WON'T-THEY RUBBISH: Finally, they had to include a soap opera element, with the possibility of a romance between the Doctor and Rose. Name one TV show these days that doesn't have the will-they-won't-they component. Again, another case of selling out in order to get viewers.<br /><br />In short, I found the series disappointing and I really didn't want to. The whole thing seemed to me like a lot of bells and whistles, designed to draw in viewers, but lacking the necessary substance beyond the surface glitter. Great special effects cannot cover for poor writing indefinitely. Eventually, when the novelty fades, people are going to start wondering why they praised this show so highly, and they'll probably start casting a fond eye back to the way it was.

B000268QB2|5.0|I have owned this CD for a little over a year now and regularly listen to it.  It is one of the few that I can listen to from start to finish, without skipping songs. <br /> <br />You've likely heard \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and \\"Everybody's Changing\\" on the radio.  These are the power-hitters. <br /> <br />I like \\"Bend And Break\\" a lot (it does have a definite Coldplay feel to it). <br /> <br />I also like \\"This Is The Last Time\\", \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\", \\"She Has No Time\\", \\"Untitled 1\\" (very cool sounding) and \\"Bedshaped\\" (also has a slightly Coldplay-esque feel to it in parts). <br /> <br />I guess if I was forced to pick my least favorite songs on the album, I'd probably have to pick \\"Your Eyes Open\\", \\"Can't Stop Now\\" and \\"Sunshine\\".  These really are not bad songs, but they don't click with me as much as the others. <br /> <br />While I agree with those who've included references to Coldplay and Freddy Mercury (which are not insults, in my opinion), Keane definitely has its own sound.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|AA has outdone themselves... \\"With Oden on Our Side\\" is one of the best releases from any metal band in a long time... Every trac has hooks that keep you comming back for another listen... best tracks are Asator (if only for the storytelling nature of the lyrics)... and Valhall Awaits Me, Runes To My Memory, Hermod's Ride To Hel-Lokes Treachery Part 1 & Gods Of War Arise.

B0001I55SS|4.0|I don't recall Walt Disney making any science fiction movies before the Black Hole.Its a fun movie with the mad scientist and his assistant,which in this case happens to be an evil robot. The  monster in this story was in fact the Black Hole itself. The whole story line was good,it had a different look for a film dealing with something we don't know to much about. I enjoyed the entire cast, and the robots also. This is a science fiction movie with a twist,and fun to watch. An interesting thought, I don't believe Disney has ventured into space since the Black Hole.
B000GG4Y32|3.0|I first saw Reds about 9 years ago on a scratchy VHS.  I had some fond memories of it and thought I might get more out of it remastered.  Here's a movie with a prepondernce of talent, drama, and social commentary.  The first hours is spellbinding.  Beatty and Keaton give strong 70s-ish performances, and Nicholson is spellbinding as Eugene O'Neill.  The \\"witnesses\\" such as Henry Miller are funny, and insightful.  The remaining TWO AND A HALF HOURS, however, are intermitent at best.  This is Beatty doing his Doctor Zivago schtick, and doubling the running time of a biopic for a historical figure who doesn't have the depth, imporance, or longevity to deserve it.  This is not Ghandi, Malcolm X, or Howard Hughes.  He's a womanizing, trust-fund socialist journalist who has some place in history, but not 3-1/2 hours,
0316166685|2.0|There were many places in this book where I found myself rolling my eyes and saying, \\"Oh, come on.\\" The writing is serviceable but not literary. Almost every plot point could be anticipated. I suppose its premise is somewhat original, but rather than feeling much emotion while reading this book, I just wanted it to be over with. Having had a teen-age friend murdered, I thought I would feel something more: my point being, I SHOULD have, but the book just didn't rise to that level. I found it to be simplistic and, frankly, sappy.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This film is the funniest, most truthful, joyous, and moving thing I've seen all year.

B0002B15XI|3.0|I first saw M*A*S*H when I was a sophomore in college.  This was 1970.  My friends and I thought it was a great flick. What did we know?  (Look up the definition of \\"sophomoric.\\") <br /> <br />Now, almost 40 years later, I see it for what it was, despite its comic moments, e.g., the football game (\\"He has a sister named Gladys. Use it.\\"), Trapper's cache of olives, and the \\"pros from Dover\\" performing surgery in their golf shoes, knickerbocker trousers with argyle socks, and Corporal O'Reilly's gift of precognition. <br /> <br />However, this movie, along with its overrated TV series is an unabashed example of the \\"Blame America First\\" school of thought which permeates our entertainment community today. <br />
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Yes, it's a little murky on logic.  It's a dull polemic.  But it's also accurate in a way that's irreputal if you just watch it.  All the angry 1-stars, I'm betting, have never gotten within 50 miles of this movie.  Why would they bother with watching this liberal propoganda before they choose to review it based on whatever Rush or Hannity told them to say about it?  It's an imporant, activist movie.  It will scare everyone in America: half will be scared because it makes a pretty clear point about the damage we're doing to the earth; the other half will be scared because they see it as a full-frontal attack on whatever industries they work for, their poltical ideology, or their pocketbooks.  You know what side you're on.  I'm not saying either is better than the other.  I'm just saying watch a movie before you review it.
B000I5X81A|5.0|What can be said? There are no suitable adjectives. Blows away even how good I anticipated it would be. Cale like I've never heard him. Clapton found his way \\"home\\". I've been an ardent Cale fan since the 70s, Clapton's a decade earlier. THE Master accompanied by The Master: Cale - the master songwriter, the master of style, atmosphere & feel; Clapton - the master musician, the master of presentation, polish & production. In their individual ways, both masters of presence - distinct routes to a common end. Hearing this album, you realize how closely their music has parallelled all along. Usually, greatness together yeilds strained competition. This collaboration is effortless and natural, allowing them to compliment each other to new heights yeilding a whole far more accomplished than even the sum of the halves could ever hope to achieve. True musical soulmates finally together. The partnership so \\"right\\" you wonder if they haven't played together for years in other lives? This release causes me to hope that it is just a taste of many more to follow ... <br />
