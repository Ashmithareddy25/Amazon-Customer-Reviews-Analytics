B000QXDED6|3.0|I really had a hard time getting into this film and kept falling asleep. I'm sure it is a great movie I have only watched it once so I really can not comment for a good rating. The actor and previews was what had me buy it. Other people said it is a great movie so I will take there word.
0062124293|4.0|I laughed out loud a lot while reading this book. At one point (Caz's comment about the \\"stupid new dog\\" being pregnant) I almost fell off the couch laughing. My husband kept asking me what was so funny, so I would have to try to explain, or read passages aloud. I will admit, it lost something out of context. I got blank stares.<br /><br />I took off one star for writing style. I'm very picky about style, and while hers worked for the most part, there were some errors and weaknesses. After a while, the capitals & exclamation marks felt amateurish.<br /><br />Content was excellent - funny and therefore entertaining, yes, but thought-provoking and important. I found myself agreeing with her on almost every issue. I read the one-star reviews here and had to roll my eyes at some of the squeamish comments, especially from women. Yes, these things can sound gross, but they happen to YOUR body too. I also had to wonder if any of these one-starrers were raving fans of the Fifty Shades trilogy. I would like to see a Venn diagram of these demographics, actually.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that this book is important. The conversation is too important not to have. Her assessment on the state of gender equality is right - in some ways, women have made great strides, but we're not there yet, and we can't ever just say \\"yeah, that's probably good enough\\" and stop trying.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|This film makes you think what will the world bring our way in the future. Was he the last person to stay in that city. Will Smith was great and had a crazy thought on how to save what was to come. I enjoyed this to the end full of action and at the same time mystery. Great buy.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Amazing=this show! I am completely obsessed with it! I can not wait for the 6th season to start! I have laughed so hard and will continue to laugh as long as this show is on the air!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Wow, was really looking forward to this Ridley Scott pre-qual and although it wasnt as good as I hoped, I still enjoyed it! Great sci-fi movie I've seen in a long time! I had to dig deeper to find that Ridley Scott originally requested Fox budget his movie at 230 million but they declined and only set his budget at 130 million. Fox didnt think the film would do as well as Scott envisioned and would explain why the movie wasnt as good as it should have been releasing Scott of any fault and shifting the blame on FOX! Now Fox is supposedly going to front more money to budget the next Prometheus seeing how well the first one did!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I cannot tell you how many people come in to buy this and act mad when they figure out what it is about. First off it was based off Twilight Fan Fiction. So, if you didn't like Twilight, DON'T read it. Secondly: Yes, it is erotica. If you are a Christian, don't read it if you think it will make it you uncomfortable. It's the first thing I tell any customer that buys: It is erotica.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed it. Not everything you read has to be educational or make you grow as a person. We can all have a little fun.. Don't get your panties in a knot!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|fast reading.... leaves you guessing about the characters, intriguing concept with factual truth.<br />I definitely enjoyed reading this book in 2 days..
B00701L5XS|5.0|It really does show you how to tie the knots. With 2 lines being used to for a knot they are both different colors to ensure you don't mix it up.
0307744434|3.0|A unique and unusual book for sure. Unfortunately the actual story and it's characters are FAR overshadowed by endless descriptions of settings and backdrops. I would estimate that a good 60% of the book is dedicated to exaggerated and extravagant scene description.
B0060DYMT6|5.0|Not usually a psychological thriller type -- this one was not frightening and the plot twists were entertaining. An evening well spent.
0307352145|5.0|This extensive work will confirm a lot of what introverts already know about themselves AND so much more they may not know. The extensive studies can get a bit drawn out at times (as most research-laden books do) but this book explores the historical, political and psychological impacts introverts as well as extroverts have on our society. The book provides a thought provoking and insightful contemplation of human behavior as a whole.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I love Where's My Water. This game doesn't seem as good. Totally derivative and the puzzles seem too easy. Not a Phineas and Fern fan.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|Lots of cheesy one liners, but good acting pulls them off fairly well. Fast paced story line makes it seem a bit unrealistic, but there is a lot to cover in time allotted. Special effects are pretty good, Set design was great. Nice little plot twist at the end. VERY entertaining, don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy the campy hero.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I kept hearing alot of talk about this trilogy, everywhere you went their was talk about how great it was.  My opion is ,there are a lot of women looking for something in their lives.  the first two were somewhat boring.  The third one aleast seem to have a story line.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wish the author would continue with the series. Awesome read!  My only complaint is I did not like the way the story bounced back and forth in this bk from past to present. It was a little confusing. I liked the way bk 1 and 2 were written much better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it gets harder and harder and it's really fun it was super addicting. I can't put it down. you should get this app.
030758836X|5.0|I have not reviewed a book in what feels like years and years.  However, I just completed `Gone Girl' last evening and already found myself, in a bookshop, recommending it to someone.<br />This is an engrossing, well-written read with enough twists and turns to give one whiplash.<br /><br />I am not going to go over the plot, in detail, since so many reviewers have already done so.  Suffice it to say that a husband [Nick] is found to be a suspect in his wife's disappearance.  The reader meets the wife [Amy] through her diary entries.<br /><br />This is how I based my 5 star review:<br /><br />Prose:  This is written with care and clarity.  The characters are extremely well defined.  At times, the pacing of the prose is melodic.  There are certain passages that carry a specific beat, a tone, a rhythm of their own.<br /><br />Dialogue:  I enjoyed Ms. Flynn's flare for dialogue.  At times, it seemed crisp, and this is something I always like.<br /><br />Plot:  It does make one wonder just how much a person may believe he/she knows another person.  It may also reduce the rate of new marriages.  In many ways, this might be viewed as a `he said/she said' plotline.  A wife is missing, there are signs of a struggle, and the husband doesn't have an alibi.<br /><br />Dysfunction:  It brings a new meaning to dysfunctional relationships.  This not only applies to marriage relationships but to parent-child relationships.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl' provided great company, and this is often one of the things that I look for in a book.  It allowed me an escape, an almost `time out,' and I much appreciated this aspect of the book especially at this particular time.<br /><br />It would be dishonest of me if I didn't share that I thought this mystery/thriller to be, at times, great fun.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|hey people who say that the reviews are fake yall should get a life i mean just cause yall dont like it dont mean there fake you shouldnt act like your the one who knows everything
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fantastic that this app is finally available!  I expected a lot of glitches and bugs, but thus far it works beautifully, and is wonderfully FAST!  I can now jump on Pinterest for a few minutes in a waiting room or for hours on a trip!! Woo hooooo!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game.I like how its sorta kinda like but not really. but still is kinda like mario<br />thanks
B001GCUO5W|2.0|Great visuals, somewhat predictable outcome, haphazard evolution of plot. Not a movie that is very satisfying to watch, it's all over the place.<br /><br />The dialogue is very choppy, sort of like video game style.<br /><br />The movie ends, and you have to wonder about the objective of it all.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|GREATEST BOOK EVERRRR!!!! For all you pepole who have read the books and seen the movie are my nee best friends and are worthy of my respect. The two star-crossed lovers sigh I love that. Gale has mixed feelings for Katniss while Peeta actually loves her sigh. for you first time  readers  I wont spoil who she picks<br /><br />Max

B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is amazing... ecspecially for being free! the battery is fun to cuztomize and everything is helpful. although the kindle fire does tell you the percentage of battery in the settings, its easier to use this app. battery hd is worth a try! it offers to get the paid version (add free) but you barely notice the adds anyway :)
B0086700CM|3.0|love the game but glitchy on my s3...it freezes and has bad delays. needs to be retested to work on all devices
1250006341|4.0|This is a gorgeous book full of beautiful color photographs so I can't imagine it on a small black and white Kindle screen. It doesn't recount the plot line, but what faithful viewer needs that? Instead it gives background information about individual characters that isn't explicitly spelled out in the show, and that's fascinating. It also provides historical and sociological context for the early modern era surrounding WWI that would be interesting anyway, but is especially intriguing because it impacts people viewers of the show have come to feel they know well. The back of the book has a two page list of books for further reading about the time, some of which are excerpted in this volume, and I know I'll be hunting down some of those.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Okay, here we have a film released in 1975 that scared the pants off of me and made me jump out of my seat, completely blowing my cool in front of a 1st date.  Amazed that she hung around for a 2nd date.  I have the previously released Jaws on Standard Def with DTS 5.1 audio which I thought was pretty decent.<br /><br />I guess I didn't know what I was missing and though it went against my frugal nature, I paid full pop for this new Blu Ray release.  The video transfer to Blu Ray is just about the best you can or will find anywhere and is completely demo worthy.  The details in each frame, the coloration of the entire movie are totally outstanding.  Even the extra which documents the reproduction of Jaws onto Blu Ray was interesting and informative.  Deleted scenes, outtakes, making of and many more extras are included.  A DVD SD copy is included which I haven't viewed and probably will not though I am sure the color correction and clarity are probably amazing for Standard Def fans.<br /><br />The audio is now DTS 7.1 and though some might disagree,  I would not say that the audio is demo worthy for anything other than excellent clarity and a broad soundstage across the front 3 channels.  Except for the underwater scenes and a few other foley effects, the rear surrounds are not really used very much as discreet channels.  The chaos on the beach could have easily used the rear channels some more,  Never the less, Universal wanted to stay true to the original release and I understand why the rears were not employed very often.  I am just saying that if I want to show off the audio section of my home theater, I would not use this release.  My home theater is fairly esoteric and hi end and audio is something I am always aware of.<br /><br />In some ways, Universal has cut its own throat.  If they can reproduce such an old movie resulting in a film better seen on this release than they saw originally in the theaters, then there is no excuse for such sloppy releases of old movies that are being  transferred to Blu Ray.  Universal.....if you can do it here, you can do it for any of your films.<br /><br />A great release, a must release.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksd movies that are being  transferred to Blu Ray.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Generally I'm not into romance novels, very, very rarely read them. I would not describe this as 'porno' just a modern take on an 80's style of \\"romance\\" writing.  In my teens there was this publishing company(?) Mills and Boons (M&B) which used to mass produce romance novellas that were very popular with teens and housewives back home and you could read one in an hour or two.  They always featured a 20-something virgin meeting a rich sexy hunk with hair greying at the temples in some unbelieveable situation.  And this is bascially how I would descibe 50 shades - it just takes a couple extra hours than a regular M&B book to finish, + I have known some of the M&B to be more erotically explicit.<br />I only got the first book because I was pulled into the moment when I found quite a few of my friends and family reading it.  I asked a cousin if it was worth the read and she said only if you have an open mind.  As I had been reading some intense true crime material and studying for a while I was looking for a change of reading material, something light and not too brain engaging - 50 shades was that.  I did enjoy it, I got the other two books to finish the story - because thats just the way I am, cant leave a movie half way through even if it is the most boring thing since watching paint dry.  Personnally I thought that the third book was the best of the lot, had a bit of a story going on.  I knocked of a star because there was that annoying thing of repeatedly biting the lower lip, the inner goddess waffle, check out the 1-star reviews for the other annoying habits the main characters or the author has. I am not a Twlight fan so cant comment on that aspect.<br />Basically if you're looking for something light to relieve boredom for a couple hours or for a change of pace to your regualar reading, try this, but if you are looking for the sex thriller that the media hype made it out to be - yes there is a lot of sex especially in the first book - but I doubt its anythingthat will get your libido interested so highly unlikely you'll be jumping your bloke afterwards.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I fell in love with this \\"little known\\" Capra classic after being inundated with it when it was public doman in the 70's. At one point you could see it on multiple channels, 7 days a week during the holidays. Then NBC (I think) bought the rights and begain rationing it like they do with \\"The Ten Commandments\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". Now if you miss the one or 2 showings a year, well you've missed it. Now with the advent of home video you can see it anytime, anyplace. I like the transfer and the special features of the 2 disk set. It's exactly what I wanted and what I paid for. The only problem is it's been loaned out by family members and I can't get it back. Probably have to buy a second helping. I hate relatives...<br /><br />Worf
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I find it too tame and somewhat boring.  One thing that gets to me is Ana kept saying or rather thinking \\" Holy Sh*t\\" too often. What is she? A clueless teenager?  The storyline doesn't grab my attention. I'm not sure if I should read other books. I'm considering on reading \\"Mind-Blown\\" by Michele Hart on my friend's recommendation. Let's see if I can compare those two.<br />Would I recommend this? I may say \\"read at your risk.\\"

0345803485|1.0|Oh, please, give me a break from this horrendous piece of fiction! I could write better than this. Wait a second, I have written better than this.<br /><br />I need a break from \\"gorgeous\\" Christian, his looks, his body, his smell, his wierdo fantasies. Ana is simply not credible. She has the mind of an eighth grader, not a college student. My apologies to all intelligent eighth graders. She's entranced by his persuasive powers, his svengali-like persona. She is as immature as they get, simpering over him. She doesn't see him for what he is, a tortured soul who \\"plays\\" with his victims like a cat with a mouse.<br /><br />What reasonable adult in her right mind would fall for such a fantastical scheme, signing a contract, allowing him to \\"torture\\" her.<br /><br />PULLEASE! No more of Christian Grey. How did the author ever get published? All the girl does is says Jeez, and anything much more than that is not worth my time and energy to read this drivel. Spare yourself your hard-earned money! Not even worthy of one star.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Love the Marware Vibe Case Cover with Stand for Kindle Fire.

0618680004|5.0|This book is utterly compelling, logical, thought-provoking and at times extremely amusing.<br />I realise now that for most of my life (I'm 54) I have been a 'fence-sitter' never really questioning my own stance on religion but only for the reason that I have never felt the need. Call it apathy if you like ...I just went 'with the flow' while always being quite alarmed by the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who purport to support its different flavours.<br />Having read this book I am now a complete convert to what I have always felt in my heart but never owned up to. I have always thought I should live for today because this life is all I can be sure I've got or am ever going to get. It is liberating to feel okay about this stance and in fact it does exactly as Dawkins says and makes you more determined to make your life count for something and not because of some after-life bollocks.<br />My only criticism is his use of words which I constantly had to look up in a dictionary (and some were not even in my pocket Collins). I didn't have a university education but still consider myself reasonably intelligent, so it is frustrating when he uses words that are needlessly non-mainstream and he, at times, makes himself look a bit intellectually nerdy (and me feel thick). It breaks the flow of reading to delve constantly into finding definitions, although my vocabulary is now the better for words I doubt I'll ever use.<br />Here are a few taken at random: fiat, memes, excoriating, troika, consubstantial, deontology,
0793518326|1.0|Upon receipt, I was disappointed in the relatively small size of the book - not in quantity of the music but the physical size.  It is very difficult to read because the printing it so small.  It appears not to have been published for musicians wishing to play from this book.  The next problem is the printing quality is really poor - so adding that to the already small print size and it is very difficult to decipher the parts.<br /><br />But here's the major issue - the transcriptions are incorrect!  The first piece I looked at was Lady Madonna to see the piano transcription and it is not even close to what was actually played.  Many transcriptions have errors - even classical music books can contain errors.  But in this one example, what is written is so far off base that I can't imagine the transcriber actually worked using a piano or other instrument.<br /><br />The Beatles music books have long been pretty shabby over the years.  The various speeds used in recording can often make it difficult to know exactly which key they were playing in.  There is a tremendous need for a book such as this - however this book has failed miserably.<br /><br />There are some guitar books that have very good note for note transcriptions of selected Beatles work.  But pianists have not been given such quality tools and this book doesn't help.<br /><br />Save your money.  Don't buy this book if you are a musician wishing to learn/analyze the various parts played on The Beatles recordings.

0141197706|3.0|I finished this one many weeks back now and have struggled to find something to say about it.  If you are looking for a book by Austen, I think you can skip this one unless you must read all of it.  Here, Jane's characters reach their most insipid form and the author has them expending their time and energy in search of minutia.  The book could have lost 1/3 of its size and the story would not have suffered.<br /><br />At the same time, the novel's back story might contain her best example of the worst parts in Regency gentry life.  So, if you read Austen was as a critic or satirist primarily, you might find something here.  Just look past the main character and her interests to find it.<br /><br />Her language is, as always, wonderful.

B008602KQI|4.0|This is a pretty good movie. My wife read the books, and says the movie is pretty close.<br /><br />Acting: very good to excellent. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job, and, oh yeah, she id gorgeous. Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland are deliciously creepy. If Willow Shields does not set your teeth on edge, you have no teeth.<br />Writing: Very good. \\"Give the people a little hope, and it's good. Too much hope is bad.\\"<br />Photography: excellent.<br />Plot: all us sci-fi fans know it's been done, but it's done well here.<br /><br />I was surprised at the libertarian viewpoint for a Hollywood-made movie. Maybe the all-benevolent state ain't such a great deal after all.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the books so I can get more of the back story.

B0042FZWC0|5.0|Well, this is worth another three or four reads. It is full of all kinds of information... the words plethora and cornucopia come to mind. I borrowed this copy (Kindle) from the library but I know I will go and buy it now from Amazon so I can have access to it at all times.<br /><br />A book, fiction or non-fiction should leave you feeling inspired. Most of the time non-fiction leaves me feeling tired. Fiction is where I find energy. But in this case, this non-fiction struck all my buttons and I can't wait to get started on the ideas Mr. Guillebeau has instilled in me. Now I know what I want to do with tomorrow... and a few tomorrows after that! That's more than most books or inspirational speakers have ever done for me.<br /><br />Without delay I am off to buy the book and favorite Chris Guillebeau's website.<br /><br />Done!
B002NZV68U|4.0|It's almost heresy to redo Gene Wilder's classic interpretation of Willy Wonka, but Tim Burton's version of Roald Dahl's slightly poisonous sweet story is in a way more faithful to the famous, if dark children's author, and certainly it stands on its own. I enjoyed it, and one way to enjoy it is just to put aside any thoughts of the original film and go along for the ride.<br /><br />There are a few clinkers; I loved Deep Roy as all the Oompa Loompas, and also as a few single roles (the psychiatrist.) But the computer graphics that replicated him to become ALL the Oompa Loompas was a bit boring, and he was too small--the teensiness of the new Oompa Loompas made them almost insignificant. Likewise, some of Danny Elfman's Oompa songs got a bit dull--though they weren't bad. Just not catchy, like the original.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is a troubled Willy, who has more than a streak of mean in him. He seems somewhat unengaged. The annoying children are fine (I loved Veruca, she was by far the best) and the casting for Charlie Bucket and his grandad were right on. Helen Bonham Carter, however, looked a bit out of place.<br /><br />The factory failed to dazzle me, but I loved the elevator. I just went along for the ride and enjoyed it almost as much as the original. You just have to take it at face value.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|While I knew Brad Pitt had plenty of fans, I had never understood why he had such a strong following until I sat down and watched this movie.  Having read the book and already familiar with the story the movie is based on, I just couldn't get over how convincing of a performance Pitt turned in.  He really adds a personal and emotional depth that even the best written books can't fully convey.  While Jonah Hill and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are also extremely well cast for their respective roles, Pitt is definitely the straw that stirs the drink in this one.  I can't imagine any other actor pulling off the part the way he did.  It helps if you like the game of baseball, but anybody who has experienced times in life where the desire to fulfill one's own goals intersects and/or collides with the pressure of meeting the demands and often carrying the burden of expectations of so many others one has to deal with on an everyday basis in life will relate well to the lead character's relentless pursuit to do it his way in the face of so much intense scrutiny and criticism from every direction.<br /><br />From scenes ranging between being brutally honest in face to face confrontations with stubborn members of his staff, outmaneuvering others in his peer group in hastily arranged trade discussions, to trying to mask his anxieties and stress in an effort to make the most of what little time away from his job he could get with his young daughter who's sensing the strain he's dealing with, Pitt's portrayal of Billy Beane under siege is somebody nearly any viewer can have an understanding of and even empathy for.  While the film ends with Pitt's often embattled character left feeling he'd fallen short of what he'd hoped to achieve and unsure of what tough choices to make next, I couldn't help but continue to pull for him to keep trying as the screen went black and the credits began to roll.<br /><br />While there's certainly going to be more movies made with one sport or another asa backdrop to the story's premise, there won't be many that explore how determined someone's will has to be to challenge the system while being trapped deep inside it as Moneyball has.  Brad Pitt really raised the bar here.  This was a tough one to get right, and he nailed it.  He should have gotten the best actor award for Moneyball because there won't be another performance that stays with people like his does for quite a long time.
B008602KQI|2.0|Unfortunately the writer has many similarities the amazing work done in Japan.  The material appears to be stolen although the author claims to have never heard of Battle Royale.  The Hunger Games has a very hollow feel and seem it may have needed a bit more in the way of character development as you never really felt anything for them.  I really wanted to like it, but it just never took off for me.  Watchable but very boring overall.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|As much as I loved A Game of Thrones, liked A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, I disliked this book  Also hated A Feast for Crows.  Self-indulgent, wandering purple prose going nowhere, a total waste of time.  If you're hoping for some resolution for the characters you've grown to love and hate, forget it.  They are all just left in limbo.  Martin should have stopped while he was ahead because this definitely left a bad taste, a feeling he just spewed it out to make some more money.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a really fun game and is kind of addicting after a while and the fun never ends ever
B0083SBMBM|3.0|Don't get me wrong-it was good. However, I had high expectations and had hoped for it to be GREAT. Friends and family told me it was great, but I though it was just good. Definitely entertaining and visually stimulating though.

B005J4TLQG|5.0|Attack the Block is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Though it is very much its own movie, I can't help but draw a comparison to Shaun of the Dead. Not because it is also set in the UK, but more because the films are sort of mirror images of each other. Where \\"Shaun\\" is a comedy with action and horror elements, though, \\"Attack\\" is primarily a horror and action movie with comedy elements.<br /><br />Rookie director Joe Cornish learned well from Edgar Wright though, because aside from keeping the action down to only what is necessary to tell the story, he also allows the film to slow down at a couple points. Just enough to allow his film to have actual characters, with substance and dimension, not just pointless action-guy schlock. It's refreshing to see these things in any movie released today, since so much has become recycled, rebooted, remade, or sequalized, but especially so for a first film.<br /><br />And speaking of refreshing, the acting in \\"Attack\\" is superb, despite the shoestring budget. John Boyega as the film's lead is exceptional, and I look forward to seeing him rip through future roles. He has serious talent. The supporting cast is all golden though, even though I was familiar only with Nick Frost prior to seeing the film.<br /><br />For an American like myself, giving advice to fellow Americans, I will say this: You're going to miss things, and some dialog is just not going to make sense, because for the most part we aren't exposed to British slang. I have some friends in the UK, and though I wasn't familiar with many of the expressions, if you keep them in mind from the beginning as you hear them, you won't have any trouble understanding what the slang or expressions mean. And I take exception to a reviewer saying we'd need to have subtitles for an American version or that this might as well be in a foreign language for all we'd not understand. That's just juvenile.<br /><br />Attack the Block is definitely worth watching if you have any level of interest in science fiction, horror, or action movies. The dialog isn't pandering to non-native audiences (which I appreciated, the alternative would have felt dumbed-down and phony), the acting is top notch, the score is excellent and well-implemented, and at 88 minutes, the film doesn't drag or get bogged down in pointless action. Overall it's a great way to spend an hour and a half.level of interest in science fiction, horror, or action movies.

B00288KNLS|4.0|As a big fan of stop-motion animation (using physical objects), any time a stop-motion film gets wide distribution I celebrate.  Simply put, stop-motion animation is my favorite film making medium.  I did it as a kid and I appreciate its unique place in the world of film art today.  Unlike 2d cell animation (Disney style), 3d stop-motion animation seams to be finding a place in the computer driven world of feature films.  Though not specifically advancing the art of stop-motion animation, Coraline dutifully keeps it alive for all the right reasons.<br /><br />WARNING: RISK OF SEVERE GEEK JUICING BEYOND THIS POINT!!!  PLEASE WEAR EYE PROTECTION!!<br /><br />STOP-MOTION = CREEPY<br />If you want a fantasy to be creepy, inject a little stop-motion and you will be successful.  If you look back at prominent films that employ Stop-motion it becomes clear: Corps Bride, Nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, Wallace and Gromit, the Curse of the Were Rabbit, Chicken Run and everything Ray Harryhausen did.  Stop-motion usually equates to creepy or fantastic.  Most fans of the technique would agree that it's the slightly jerky and awkward movements that contribute to the surreal and eerie feel that is so effective in these films.  \\"Coraline\\" is a very creepy film and even more so for employing stop-motion.<br /><br />TAKING A STEP BACK FROM \\"CORPSE BRIDE\\"<br />In my humble opinion \\"Corpse Bride\\" was the best feature film done entirely in stop-motion.  As the first film to use digital still cameras to animate 3d objects, \\"Corpse Bride\\" set the standard for character expression, meaningful movement and Stop-motion artistry.  \\"Coraline\\" takes a slight step back from \\"Corpse Bride\\" in its animation technique.  Things don't move quite as smoothly.  Characters don't have the same sense of weight or expressiveness.  All of that aside, \\"Coraline\\" is still an excellent piece of art and I enjoyed watching it despite not meeting \\"Corpse Bride\\" standards.<br /><br />MOVING A STEP AHEAD OF \\"CORPSE BIRDE\\"<br />Where \\"Coraline\\" advances the art of film making may not be in stop motion particularly, but rather in its hybrid technique use.  \\"Coraline\\" may well be the first film to combine stop-motion with CGI and very effectively in my opinion.  Many people revile CGI due to over-reliance on it by many in the film industry.  Very often films start to look like video games.  In \\"Coraline\\" CGI is used strictly as a background device.  Some might call this \\"cheating\\", but I can't imagine how this film could be achieved as effectively without it.  As much as I love stop-motion, CGI has its place and this was a creative place to use it.<br /><br />ACTORS WHO DON'T SING<br />\\"Coraline\\" is unique for a stop-motion film in that there are no extraneous musical numbers in the place of conversation.  That does not mean there is no music at all, it just means that the music occurs when it might in reality:  While someone plays the piano, in a theater, and at the Circus.  I was taken aback when the characters broke out in song during \\"Corpse Bride\\".  I never expected it and it took a couple of viewings to get used to it.  In Coraline the music was natural and unobtrusive.  Though I've never heard Dakota Fanning (Coraline) or Teri Hatcher (Mom 1 and Mom 2) sing, I'm not disappointed I haven't yet.  They both did excellent work here with Hatcher being the surprise of the day.  She personally made the \\"Stepford Wives\\" look downright inviting.  I don't want to take the time to talk about all the actors, though I should mention all involved make significant contributions.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT THE STORY \\"GEEK-MIAS\\"?<br />I enjoyed the story quite a bit.  The question is, will you?  Here's how my family received this film.<br />WIFE:  she doesn't like being reminded of her own mortality, so she was not too thrilled with a story that has dead children in it.  She thought the movie was ok but didn't like the subject matter.<br />SON:  as a sensitive 6 year old, he was somewhat frightened by it.  He liked the format and the fantasy, but was less than thrilled with the bugs and scary stuff, same as my wife.<br />DAUGHTER:  She liked it.  As a 10 year old, she related a lot to Coraline because she's close to the same age and has awful parents just like Coraline... ...wait, did I say that?  Regardless, I've raised her to enjoy scary stuff so she was with it.  She thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />ME:  I love stop-motion and the story was original enough to keep me guessing.  There were dead children, so peril was well established.  There are plenty of quirky (crazy) characters and plenty of creepy stuff too, so I was well satisfied.<br />THE 4 YEAR OLD SITTING NEXT TO ME:  \\"Mommy, I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN!!\\"  I guess she didn't like it.  That warmed my heart.<br /><br />LIKE THE CHILDREN OF \\"HAMLIN\\", I'M HOOKED<br />Though not reaching the heights that \\"Corpse Bride\\" did, \\"Coraline\\" immediately went on my DVD wish-list after leaving the theater.  Seeing it in 3D was really not important and actually a distraction.  Seeing it without the glasses is fine.  The story is dark like many fairy tales and harkens back to the \\"Pied Piper of Hamlin\\" which creeped me out as a kid, so your kids might be a little disturbed.  For fans of stop-motion, it's a reason to smile.<br /><br />-Story...............4 Stars<br />-Animation..........4.5 Stars<br />-Characters..........4.5 Stars<br />-Family Appeal...3 Stars<br /><br />Total.....3.87 Starsd, he was somewhat frightened by it.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I had previously installed this in 2011 and the interface was less than desirable. I decided to give it another chance, since I hadn't found a weather app I liked in the interim. I was pleased to find the bugs had been addressed and all was in working order. I only wished to have an app with a reliable forecast(at least as much as they ever are)and an animated radar feature. I have found this app exceeds those basic demands and operates smoothly on my Kindle Fire. Very happy with this.
B007VYQ9G2|1.0|Shame,Shame,Shame no I,am not speaking of the song from the seventies but a harsh slap on the face for Disney Pictures.Disney known for the grander and love of its family movies Like Snow White,Cinderella,Jungle Book and others should be ashame that Walt Disney is rolling in his grave.This film aimed at children is a digrace in that it shows canabilism when the Chimpanzee eat other smaller monkeys.When we saw this film in theaters and this scene occured I removed myself and my neice and nephew from the theater, and promised myself I would not ever return to see another Disney nature film in theaters or on home video.My advise to you as a parent that might want to show the good side of nature and not the bad would be to avoid buying this disney feature Chimps and maybe by not buying this and others that show such damaging material for children Disney will get the hint and not forget the roots that they came from which they apparently have forgotten.<br />AVOID THIS DVD OR BLU RAY AND BUY ANOTHER NICE DISNEY FILM..........................................................

B006HGXGWU|5.0|[[ASIN:B006HGXGWU Take Shelter]] (by the writer/director of 'Shotgun Stories') is one heck of an intriguing, well-acted, sharply-written, deeply disturbing tale.<br /><br />The protagonist imagines, vividly, that there is an apocalyptic storm set to hit his small town - soon. He attempts to communicate this notion to his friends, family, and co-workers; to no avail. They see him as 'worked up,' about 'nothing.'<br /><br />Have they ever witnessed weather that might threaten their lives? No. Thus, they continue with their daily, mundane routines. While the protagonist mortgages his home to revamp an underground shelter in his backyard...<br /><br />...to his wife's...horror.<br /><br />With an entire town - even his family seemingly against him - he begins to doubt his very sanity. Has he inherited the same mental issue that claimed the functional sanity of his mother? He wonders.<br /><br />Thus, here is the essential conflict, driving this tale:<br /><br />Can the protagonist trust his vivid imagination, his gut-level feelings, his intuition? Ah yes; he does have a bit of 'physical evidence,' in the form of strange bird formations in the sky, and odd 'sludge' coming down during rainfalls. Yet are these, in addition to his visions, enough, for him to trust himself, over others? Or are those in his life, 'onto something,' when they disregard his bleak vision of future 'weather horror' as speculation at best - madness, at worst?<br /><br />The answer is revealed in a final sequence that is truly breathtaking, disturbing, beautifully filmed; to state it mildly.<br /><br />It is among my favorite finales in film history.<br /><br />The 'subtext,' or underlying theme here?<br /><br />If you have an intuitive sense that something 'just isn't right' - it may well be best to trust your instincts; rather than the opinion of the 'mass of Man,' which might well dub you, 'mad.'<br /><br />A great film. Unquestionably.<br /><br />Watch, uninterrupted, all the way through, for best results.

B005LAIISA|4.0|I saw this one with a tween-age girl, so the \\"my parents don't understand\\" message worked pretty well - for her, at least. Cue the familial alienation plot, with predictable rapprochement in the end. There's a big, healthy \\"stand by your friends\\" message, too.<br /><br />OK, so the story was commodity material, or maybe one notch above. The animation was great, though. The CGI folks really have complex figures, motions, and textures down, and did a fantastic job with fur and hair. This one's popcorn-worthy, but it really helps to be with a kid in the target demographic.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B008MEM24S|4.0|A Preface: I purchased this game BEFORE ever playing \\"Where's My Water?\\"; this colors my review somewhat.<br /><br />Part one: The Purchase<br />This game caught my attention because I love watching Phineas and Ferb with my little brother over the summer; I think the show is fantastic so I was willing to give the app a shot at 99 cents. I had no issues downloading, and was able to start right away.<br /><br />Part two: \\"The Story\\"<br />The goal of each level is to let water (or steam) flow into a spout to fuel Agent P's decent into OWCA headquarters at the behest of Major Monogram. Something is wrong with the tubes, and Evil Doctor Doofenschmirtz is behind the problems. He has filled the tubes with Inators and you have to help Agent P get to where he's going.<br /><br />That's it. That's the story. You help Agent P move through pipes. I ticked off part of a star because I thought they could have done something more creative as the levels moved along with the story (more like the real episodes), but moving Perry through the pipes is the entire game. There are some pretty amusing parts of the narration, but this game is really and excuse to watch a platypus get frustrated because he's stuck in tubes as you fiddle with dirt and water.<br /><br />Part three: The Game play and Mechanics<br />The game play is pretty simple; you press and drag to eliminate dirt, creating pathways for water to flow. A secondary goal to getting the water in the drain is collecting all three lawn gnomes by letting enough water flow through them. Eventually there are other minor controls introduced, like buttons to push to activate lasers or spigots to turn to start the flow of water. New mechanics come in - celebrateinators that vaccuum out your water, freezinators that ice over the water, heatinators that convert water into steam, goo that corrupts water and blocks drains or explodes pipes, and eventually lava goo and ice goo. There is enough variety to keep you interested, and some of the puzzles take a few tries to get right. Others are very simple, but require some trickery to both pass the level AND collect all three gnomes (like collecting ducks in \\"Where's My Water?\\"<br />If you already have and like \\"Where's My Water?\\", \\"Where's My Perry?\\" probably isn't going to be too much new for you; it's more of a Phineas and Ferb expansion pack. If you enjoyed the game, however, you will probably enjoy figuring out the new puzzles.<br /><br />As of publishing, there are four stages out with about twenty levels each; new levels are supposed to come out \\"soon,\\" and I will continue to look forward to them.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|I got everything I came to see, given expectations set by the earlier Bourne movies: great action, evil government conspiracy, a loyal and honest man horribly abused by the system and determined to free himself from it. And, given the super-soldier treatment he's been subjected to wins in the end.<br /><br />Some of the stereotypes get a bit thick. Agents of the covert agency wrap themselves in a bizarre patriotism, to swaddle their consciences from the evil they knowingly do - as long as it serves the greater good, as they define the term, that's good enough. The representative scientist within the program has an idealistic naivete about being in it only for the science, and that her personal career sacrifices somehow justify something. There's reality in those characters, though - I've seen similar beliefs, in less exaggerated form, in people I've known.<br /><br />But I didn't come for a morality play. I came for plenty of adventure, running around, blowing things up, and maybe a side order of chaste romance. I got it. Maybe a few plot elements seemed gratuitous (like LARX, a suitable foil to Our Hero seemingly conjured from nowhere), but the whole came together well.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

Her character, with never a gelled blond hair out of place, came across as steelier and more robotic than the robot character. On anyone else with a gorgeous figure like hers, the cat-suit would have enhanced the feminine side - on her, it just smoothed over those human little bumps and folds, giving an inhuman impression of plastic perfection.<br /><br />What's not: Pretty much everything else. The space-suit helmets reminded me of [[ASIN:B0019BI1DM Outland]] - the lights pointed inward, conveniently illuminating the characters' faces, but blinding them in the process. Utter lack of quarantine against alien biota worked well for the plot but badly for common sense. The android's bio-sabotage of a fellow crewman came across without feeling - not even malice or greed, just one more chore to get done. And, although enjoyable in itself, Noomi Rapace's underwear scene just couldn't compare to Sigourney Weaver's back in the original Alien.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original [[ASIN:B0000VCZK2 Alien]] movies, and Weaver's \\"Ripley\\" character in particular, this comes across as a perfectly adequate SF/monster flick, maybe a cut above in its production values. Alien is iconic, though. Prometheus gives it nothing to fear in its position at the head of modern scary-monster movies.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I felt that this was an awesome story with two well developed characters, love Travis. I am soooooo excited that there will be another book coming out with Travis's POV, amazing and great idea. Just could not get enough of the story......I want more! I feel that there should be more to the story along with bring her Dad back in with more history to the \\"Poker\\" and how he brought her into this life at an early age, and do some childhood memories that could be brought into a second story.... Just saying, crossing my fingers.<br /><br />Great movie idea as well. Inspiring me to look at writing a book of my own.
1400052181|5.0|This outstanding book presents itself largely as a biography. In that, it presents a very readable story of HeLa, the woman who unknowingly made possible vast ranges of today's biological and medical understanding. Although records seem scarce, Skloot presents Ms. Lacks life and death in the most sensitive and sympathetic way possible, despite some details of her life that some might not approve of.<br /><br />It's more than simple biography, though. In trying to understand Lacks's life, she conducted extensive interviews with her family - many of whom had strong and well-justified suspicions about some white woman prying into painful passages of family history. This book becomes their story, too, and that's what transforms the narrative. Not just biography, this examines how race, economic status, and America's class system affected Lacks and her family. In doing so, Skloot shows the human face of bioethical questions, including peoples' rights to decide the fate and uses of their tissues.<br /><br />That, in turn, starts to examine how schooling and education affect these questions. Henrietta's generation grew up in poverty, in the era when hospitals segregated their black and white patients. A completed high school education was a rarity, and even then was the poor cousin of whites' educations in the same regions. Small wonder that the family could barely tell the facts of Henrietta's contributions to medicine from the wildest fictions about her, even when the medical establishment would bother to tell them anything at all.<br /><br />This book offers much too much to summarize in just a few words. Henrietta lived in a complex time, not wholly behind us, on the cusp of incredibly complex scientific advances. Skloot does an incredible job of navigating these complex currents, with a historian's eye for plain fact but a very human sense of how those facts affect the people and loved ones caught up in them.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B0014JGDUC|5.0|These crocks are soooo very comfortable and clean up very easily.  I originally purchased them for work; now I wear them while working in the yard too! I wear them when I'm fueling & washing a big rig and haven't slipped one time!  Since they are men/women size they are a little wide in my narrow foot, this is not a big issue.  Try them, you'll love them!!

0345803507|3.0|I was so glad this turn out to be a true love story. The first two books were basically written porn. These were my 1st erotica books to ever read, so I didn't know what to except, I couldn't stop reading them so they must be good right .... Well I have read 4 other erotica books since these three... And just let me say there are much much better out there!!
0783229372|5.0|The Hindenburg directed by Robert Wise is a great movie which starred acting legends such as George.C.Scott and Anne Bancroft and as well as other great cast members. This movie is very exceptional with the scenes inside the Hindenburg where the sets of the Lounge areas, the Cabins and inside the framework and Gasbags were very accurate to how the Hindenburg really was. Scott's character of Franz Ritter who is a Colonel in the German Air Force is assigned by Goebbels as there has been Bomb threats against the Hindenburg Airship by anti - Nazi activists. As the Hindenburg, it's legend and demise is very much the same as the Titanic with people around the world, this movie is very well a must see!.
0345803485|3.0|I had never read an erotica book before. But with all the talk about this book I had to read for myself! I only order 1st book to see ... Less than half way though I went ahead and ordered the next two. I was in shock but couldn't stop reading! I did enjoy this book. And had I written this as soon as I read it I'm sure I would have stared it higher, but after these three I have read 4 other erotica books... All of them were much better written than this one!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My friend had this on his Ipad and icloved it but couldn't get it on my kindle fire now its availible on t YAY
0345803493|4.0|This book is by far the best of the three! I could not put it down. Still new to the erotica world...I didn't have anything to compared this book too... Just knew I enjoyed it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You will never forget this book, nor will you allow yourself to put it down!  Ms. Flynn is wise and talented far beyond her years.  Although this is our favorite of her 3 books, the other 2 are very worthwhile reads.  We cannot WAIT for number 4!  (Books are standalone, by the way.)  Please disregard the negative reviews - rubbish!  Congratulations for a well crafted novel that rises above most all the rest!
0425263908|5.0|I loved 50 shades.... But if I had read Bared to you 1st I'm not so sure I would have enjoyed them as much. This book was Hot and sexy without the bondage. Just a little easier to believe! I just wish I had waited until all three were out so I could have read them back to back!

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is suspenseful and intriguing.  It is a book about a young boy, Jacob, who feels isolated at school and at home.  His one connection is his grandfather.  His grandfather is an odd, peculiar man himself and often Jacob doesn't understand him.  His grandfather tells fantastical stories of his childhood, so fantastical, Jacob has a hard time believing him; yet his connection to his grandfather is so great, he wants to.<br /><br />This is a story of a young man's search for the truth of his grandfather's childhood.  In the end, he realizes he's not so different from his grandfather and finds a place where he truly belongs.<br /><br />As a few others have pointed out, there are pictures in the Kindle edition that contain words which are hard to read because of how small and faint they are.  However, that would not deter me from buying this ebook.  I loved it.  I love mysteries and thrillers filled with suspense.  I would categorize this book as a mild thriller.  It wasn't a normal mystery, but a peculiar and fantastical one.  I hope there is a sequel.  Definitely worth the read!
B008D1LVRY|5.0|Yet another great album by these guys. It's hard to find an album to listen to from beginning to end these days. HellYeah has done it not once or twice, but three times. Love it!
1859418155|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2VPN521Y9FTSQ]]<br /><br />BREAKING A CERTAIN APPROACH TO JURISPRUDENCE TEACHING<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This excellent book for undergraduates is divided into 3 broad themes, sub divided into general and advanced topics. The authors have broken with the more usual approach to teaching jurisprudence which is to be welcomed for its innovative study method deployed here.<br /><br />New editions for Jurisprudence do not appear as frequently as, say `case heavy' substantive law areas so the authors have merely tinkered with the text to improve it and sharpen it for the new edition... and they do just that! So this second edition includes a rearrangement of the general sections, re-written where necessary for a more systematic coverage.<br /><br />With the advanced sections some new topics have been added, notably on law and deconstruction, and law and autopoiesis to name just a couple of areas. There's also an enhanced discussion of the rise of legal positivism linked to the rise of the modern state. The changing role of natural and human rights discourse is well covered to take account of recent developments.<br /><br />Professors Veitch, Christodoulidis and Farmer have created a very modern teaching tool here breaking from the old approaches so the book is very well described as `accessible, interdisciplinary and socially informed' and successfully takes account of the most recent developments in current jurisprudential thought. It is just what I need to explain modern jurisprudence to the worried student!

B00005JNNZ|5.0|Every school administrator and school board should be required to watch this film and abide by its precepts. Including the collegiate level...<br />Samuel L. Jackson does a tremendous, tremendous job in this.<br />As a parent and teacher, and citizen, I have been screaming this message for decades!<br />As Educators, what message are we sending these kids when we allow them to graduate high school without even being able to read??? But, they can darned sure throw a football.<br />Look at the \\"heroes\\" now - many are nothing more than high-priced criminals.<br />We glorify bad, deviant, and criminal behavior, and we have sold the soul of this country for a bloody buck.<br /><br />At least SOMEBODY, even if only in film, has the guts to make an UNCOMPROMISING, UN-RATIONALIZING, stand against it.<br />I am so pleased to know that this story is based on actual events.<br />That the kids, in the end, made their own right choice not to play in the tournament unless they got their academics in line.<br /><br />HALLELUJAH  FOR THIS FILM!!
B006RED4GA|4.0|Fun, suspenseful, and genuinely scary, The Innkeepers is a great time at the movies.<br /><br />Here's the story.  It's the last weekend for The Yankee Pedlar Inn before it closes and gets razed for a parking lot.  The Inn, established in 1891, has been around long enough to generate at least one good ghostly legend, and employees Sara Paxton and Pat Healy mean to get to the bottom of it before they shutter the place.<br /><br />That's  a fine premise for a \\"haunted hotel\\" picture.  Now, it's all about the execution.  The Innkeepers executes well by creating an appropriate atmosphere, putting interesting characters in the middle of it, generating suspense, and delivering on the big scares.  The Yankee Pedlar actually exists (and it's still in business - here's its web site), and it's everything one could want in an old hotel: quirky, lived-in, and comforting in one light while sinister in another.<br /><br />Paxton and Healy are relatable and interesting.  They're kinda aimless, kinda dorky, and not very bright; but they have an awkwardly sweet dynamic that plays well against the horror to come.  The tension begins to turn when that sweet dynamic starts to stress under the duo's mounting fear, even as we wonder whether they're witnessing an<br />actual haunting or just psyching themselves out.  It grows as we come down on one side or the other and realize that either conclusion is equally rich with possibility.  It hammers down in the best ways when they explore the basement or try to make contact or go after a mysterious guest.  And when the time comes for the big scares, man, they're big and graphic and scary and earned, because the movie took the time to build up to them.<br /><br />So it works.  It all works.  The Innkeepers is as fine a modern ghost story as you're going to find, and I dare you to try and go right to sleep just after switching it off.  As for me, I wish I hadn't seen it in a hotel.

B006O7XOOW|3.0|This would have been a total smash hit for us had it lasted longer than a day before conking out and not working. We got in a few hours of solid play-time with this until the mechanics died. It was a sudden and complete lack of sound and lighting functions from the unit. I can however say that the baby was definitely enthralled and captivated by this when it DID work for the short time it lasted. We weren't sure if it was whether the dog wanted the extremely chewable plastic balls (note to dog owners, WATCH your dog! These balls get chewed up super fast! Could be a hazard for larger pets) and found himself hypnotized by the balls \\"erupting\\" and falling down the ramp. The dog is always a good source of eye-candy for the baby. She could watch him all day and smile...so his enjoyment of watching the balls going in and out of the toy was hilarious to her.<br /><br />She did enjoy this clunker for a bit though. She cooed and continually tried to balance herself on this as she gripped with her tiny fingers. The colors were stimulating to her and you could tell she wanted to figure out how everything worked.<br /><br />Overall, I would give this more stars had it lasted a bit longer. A defective product happens every now and again so I can't fault the company too much. Aside from that, we also had issues with the durability of the plastic balls in a household with a dog that just so happens to go crazy for balls and balls alone. No squeaky toys, no rawhide, no stuffed bears...just balls. So, this was heaven for him....and for our 6 month old while it lasted.
B003VANOFY|5.0|First off, this is my first headset over $50, as well as my first wireless headset. I was looking for a good quality wireless headset, because my headphones kept breaking at the 3.5mm jack areas.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Pretty good sound quality<br />-Really comfortable (medium/large sized head)<br />-The mic quality is pretty nice<br />-Little to no static<br />-No connection issues (as of yet)<br />-Volume knob on the side is pretty handy<br />-Can walk around the house while listening to music. Heheh. :D<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Ears get a kind of warm<br />-The plastic is kind of squeaky when you move the earmuffs around<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This is a high quality product, and should last a pretty long time, as long as you don't throw it around/stomp on it. I am happy with the purchase, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good wireless headset.

0385495323|5.0|Just finished this book and I really enjoyed it. I got through it in about 2 days of solid reading which says a lot because I usually just read a few pages here and there. It is very interesting and the author wrote it very well. It is written so that anyone can understand the concepts but also gives you technical details if you are interested in those. It isn't just for the technically inclined. The history of encryption is fascinating in my opinion. Highly recommend.

B002SCKT0O|5.0|\\"Junior\\" is a very original and entertaining movie for the whole family that I don't get tired of watching.<br />After having a fertilized egg implanted into his abdomen and taking an experimental drug (designed to prevent miscarriages) combined with high doses of female hormones, Dr. Hesse (Arnold Schwarzenegger) sees his personality go from rigid to warm and sentimental. His colleagues (Danny DeVito and Emma Thompson) are drawn into this extraordinary adventure in a much unanticipated way and their personal lives are as a result completely transformed.<br />All three actors are, as always, impeccable. I strongly recommend this movie.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I kept hearing how great this book is; so I had to read it to see what all of the hype was. Yes...it is a very good book if you are into erotic reads. There was a plot and meaning behind the story; it's not all just about sex. It keeps your attention and you will not want to put it down. It keeps you wondering...what will Christian do next? After reading book one, you will definitely want to read books two and three.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got caught up in the '50 Shades of Grey' hysteria. A friend told a friend that it was a great book. Found out later she had not even read it before passing on the review. If you like your romance novels with being tied up and physically abused, this is for you. But if you don't think having your vagina, hit with riding crops, being smacked around or other nasty physical and degrading stuff, you might not like this book. Book is for s&m girls.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I first became interested in Brandon Sanderson when he took over the Wheel of Time (WOT) series after Robert Jordan died.  I liked that Sanderson was committed to carrying on Jordan's legacy, so I read some of his other books, like the Mistborn series.  The Mistborn books were entertaining but not near the technical level of his WOT writing.  I came across The Way of Kings and thought I'd give Sanderson another try...I was not disappointed.  A good epic fantasy series is very different than a stand-alone novel.  The novel just needs to contain a good story in a concise package, while the first book in a series has to create a believable world with many threads that will carry on in later books.  Sanderson has done this in The Way of Kings, both telling a good story on its own while leaving you to want more, looking forward to the next book in the saga.  Sanderson creates complex characters that readers can relate to.  Even the \\"bad guys\\" are mufti-dimensional, so that the reader wonders if they really are all that \\"bad\\".  I give this book four out of five stars, withholding one star because there were a couple places where the story moved slowly, seeming to be page-fillers that failed to advance the plot or develop a character. As Sanderson matures as a writer I expect future books in this series to overcome this one negative, and The Stormlight Archive has the potential to be as good as the WOT.
B007U1FEQW|5.0|Vinyl copies of this lp began to show up in Twin Cities record stores about a week ago.  That didn't matter to me. I ordered my copy from Amazon and I knew that it would be arriving soon.  And, as usual, it arrived even earlier than Amazon had promised.  It was well packaged and in perfect shape.  The only thing better than Amazon's low price and fast delivery was the vinyl lp itself.  Every song was a true jewel.  I am a huge Beach Boys fan and I have been waiting for a new album for a long time.  Sure!  It's not \\"Smile\\" or \\"Pet Sounds\\", but it's great to get 12 \\"new\\" songs from this rock and roll American classic group.  All Beach Boys fans should add this item to their vinyl collection.

B0080BFWE0|3.0|This film I find very entertaining.  Even 15 years later, there is a lot to love about it.  Unfortunately, the Blu-ray version leaves much to be desired.  Clunky menus and the sharpness of the transfer do not improve with this edition.  There is a fun \\"making of\\" video that was probably produced at the time of the production.  Otherwise, the features don't really stand out.  Yet, if your VHS or DVD of this movie are worn out, I would upgrade.  Otherwise, this looks like the ancient flip phone Lisa Kudrow's character muses over before they drive to Tucson.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I wanted to give this book a 5 star. I went from OMGosh this book is awesome to bored to death back to awesome then back to bored, all through the book. There were long boring parts that could of been cut in half. I don't like my Vampires to be day walkers, it takes away from the whole Vampire darkness. It was refreshing to read a book were family was important. Diana was a strong women who wasn't a smart mouth, rude, or have cuss words fly out of her mouth every other word. In fact I could say that about all the characters in the book. I know its a series, but I really hated the ending. Will I buy the second book? No. If somebody asked me if they should read A Discovery Of Witches I'd say yes.

0345803485|5.0|I normally don't write reviews for books but I decided to put my two cents in. I was wary of this book at first because I had read so many mixed reviews. However, after reading it, I really enjoyed this book. It was entertaining and not the porno book I was expecting. I liked this book because it was funny, interesting, and kept me turning page after page. I just couldn't put it down because I had to know what happened. I could really relate to Ana and Christian was a very interesting character. These characters were not flat at all. I think a lot of people had a problem with how submissive Ana could seem but really she was defiant in words and action. The book was more realistic than I was expecting even if they were a lot of sex scenes. I liked how Ana tried to keep her identity while still trying to explore her sexuality and feelings for Christian. I am glad I gave this book a shot.

B007GATVYI|3.0|I was so upset with this book, one of my \\"heroes\\" recommended this book as a good business development book. I buy the book for my kindle as I do with all my books but it is unreadable since it is all pictures, wish this was not the case as I had high hopes with this book. Please fix this asap.<br /><br />Edit: I did read this on my friends Kindle after Amazon gave me a refund for the one I bought, I guess you can buy this on kindle if you can click on every page to zoom in and out, The Kindle version gets 2 stars just cause it is annoying to do this. But the book it self gets 5, it is amazing and I really loved it, it shows you that having the right people around you can really make a difference.
0345803485|1.0|Please don't waste your time nor money on this piece of bad writing. A mediocre plot - boring, slow and unsurprising. Unlikely main character, annoying too. I can imagine a lonely house wife (no offense) from the suburbs to consider this book as the highlight of her day but most of us I believe will just flick through the pages waiting for something to happen... but the book just does not deliver. Gave it away to charity. Peace.
B001TKNWWS|4.0|Rourke is excellent as a aging wrestler disintegrating before our eyes.  His pain and weariness are frighteningly real.  And there are a number of beautifully shot sequences.<br /><br />Some of it’s a bit familiar -- especially the failed relationship with his daughter, and his friendship with a stripper who is trapped in a similar downward spiral, and may be his only hope.  But to some extent these clich&eacute;s are offset by the heartfelt approach and earnest performances.  A very good, solid movie, if not – for me – quite the masterpiece a lot of people feel it is, although it grew for me on a 2nd viewing.  Sort of splits the difference between the likable hokum of ‘Rocky’ and the artful dark, bleak genius of ‘Raging Bull’.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|By book two, I am hooked!  I love that this has an actual plot.<br />I read somewhere that these characters are modeled after Bella and Edward of Twilight fame, and<br />the character similarities are certainly present here.<br /><br />Lots of good stuff happpening, though the abuse factor of Christian's character is a bit hard to read.
0553801473|5.0|I just finished A Dance With Dragons after having put it down when I (bad form) went forward to see if Jon Snow made it through the book alive.  When it appeared he did not I THREW the book aside.  Then, I read an interview by Mr Martin where he questions Jon's death and so after much waiting I finally picked it back up and read it.  I think what we have here is the world's arguably best writer trying to do several things at once.  First of all lets remember that this is the man's livelihood, so lets not begrudge him the opportunity to capitalize on what is probably the most popular series ever.  He strings it along slowly ensuring that his fan base grows, he writes extra stuff and does tons of interviews to stoke interest and he has used his formidable connections to get his own TV series.  Pretty darn impressive and savvy.  I, personally, WAS very invested in some of the characters, but I have learned that this is foolish when reading the writings of this fellow.  He has killed off some very cool people (that he created) that I would never have even considered getting rid of.  One of the holes so far, which may be filled later, is the dead people thing.  We don't get really any interaction with them and so one wonders what their purpose really is?  Also, with all the human frailty that is displayed in ALL the characters (botheringly this includes Daenerys) you can't really root for any of them.<br />That being said and I again say this writer is awesome and I love to read what he writes.  As long as I can accept all the other facts non-judgmentally I will just keep reading and not worry what he does with his story, after all - it is his story.<br />If anyone knows of someone who is writing as well or better please let me know.
B0027MJU00|2.0|Gillian Flynn is a talented writer.  She gives her scenes and characters dimensions the less brilliant among us would never see in real life.  I so enjoyed Gone Girl that I decided to give this one a try.  Her stellar writing is on display here, and each page on its own is a pleasure.  But the plot stinks.  It twists and turns without going anywhere, and the ending is neither believable nor interesting (I can't say more than that without spoilers).  After getting drawn in by the writing in the first few pages (enough to buy the book), I became bored and barely managed to pull myself through to the end.  I hope to see more by Flynn and will check out her next book, but I can't recommend this one.

B000FBFMIO|5.0|Although this tale began as a trilogy (The Farseer Trilogy), an additional 3 books (The Tawny Man Trilogy) in the continuing story makes this great story a lengthier experience to cherish. I thoroughly enjoy Hobb's writing style. She has a knack for developing characters and relationships. Her writing style is well-paced and she provides gifts at steady intervals throughout the story, (mercifully at times when we may become distraught with the trials and tribulations of the protagonist). With a mathematician's skill she weaves together bits and pieces in a story like fine tapestry. It is amazing to see it ending 3 books beyond the original trilogy. This is one of the greatest stories of love, friendship and duty you could choose to read.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|its just like the Pet salon and Pet harvest games.

This is one of the greatest stories of love, friendship and duty you could choose to read.<br /><br />______________________________________________<br /><br />SPOILERS *** Skip this review if you have not yet read the series. *** SPOILERS<br /><br />SPOILERS *** Wait and read this after you finish the series. *** SPOILERS<br /><br />Initially I read through the series to enjoy a great story. I suspended judgement. Having completed the series I was left with many experiences and lingering memories spanning a range of emotions as I followed the characters. I came to the Farseer story after the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies had been completed so I was able to read each book and immediately continue on to the next. After the initial withdrawal adjusting to life without the story of Fitzchivalry I have some reservations about the author, Robin Hobb. I could accept the ending as written yet something definitely went wrong. The way she had carefully lead us in a direction was quickly undone in the last few chapters of Fool's Fate.<br /><br />The direction the story took was significant enough that I wonder if Hobb suffered from an illness and either struggled to end it just to finish it off, or if she went through some form of major crisis that changed her whole outlook while completing this book. According to Hobb's preparations as laid out in the story Fitz was likely to inherit a royal seat, quite possibly alongside Kettricken as a mate.........a royal equal at the least.<br /><br />Molly was only a childhood sweetheart. Fitz had acknowledged that already after a couple of other people made that point including Kettle. The relationship between Kettricken and Fitz was an adult relationship in which they both shared many things in common. Burrich and Molly had a large number of children together. This cannot be overlooked. As a plot device, its significance had no place in the ending as Hobb ultimately wrote it. The family represented the history, experiences and intimacy shared between Burrich and Molly that evinced their advanced relationship. Compare all of that with the adolescent courtship that Fitz hung onto. Molly would never have been able to set all of this aside to get back with Fitz. She would have grown through those experiences in ways Fitz could not understand. She would have been a different person by this time. Remember Burrich and Molly had fought for their lives together and got married for both practical and romantic reasons. The whole re-romancing by Fitz with the bee stinger and subsequent roll in the bushes was absurd. How could Molly do that after a life within a strong relationship with a man who died while they were still in love? Molly seemed to have forgotten Burrich when she would have remembered him the most. No one could have had sex with another person after all they had been through and not felt remorse. This would have been Molly's first time since being with the man she shared so much with. Fitz and Molly were kids together but they were only lovers for a couple of years at the most. She was with Burrich for 16 years and through 5+ children (Chivalry, Nim, Swift, Hearth, +2? others and Nettle).<br /><br />Was Hobb injured or ill? Did she find or change religion or join a cult? What happened that caused her to veer off the course this series had been on?<br /><br />Going by the momentum set in motion through the series up until thefinal chapters of Fool's Fate I suspect Fitz would have gotten together with Kettricken. He would have had a direct role as a king for some time, if not openly in secret. The Fool was meant to die and stay dead. I suspect Fitz was to find the rooster crown in his hands and eventually wear it. The Fool would have spoken to him with the minstrel group and instructed him to visit the valley of the skill dragons. There he would place the crown on Girl-on-a Dragon. At that moment she would reanimate, turn and kiss Fitz like she kissed the Fool and return his memories to him. Fitz would have the boost to return to Buckeep with a new lease on life leaving the Fool within Girl-on-a-Dragon. This ending would have left us sad for the loss of a great character (the Fool) and fulfilled as we witnessed Fitz receiving what we had always wanted for him, honor as Fitzchivalry Farseer. In that position as king/Sacrifice/Skill Master/Queen's mate, Fitz could be a father to his two children.<br /><br />Burrich was never meant to be killed off. That seems to have only been orchestrated so Fitz could get back together with Molly. As originally intended Burrich would live on to a ripe old age with Molly. Because both would now be in adult relationships, the four could be friends in as much as royalty has friends. Burrich would have wanted Fitz to return to Buckeep. Yet he would want to retain his family including Nettle believing him to be her father and Molly wishing to stay with him because she recognized he was her true love not Fitz. The Fitz we were being cultivated to accept would have never revealed his identity to Nettle or Dutiful. That is Sacrifice. He would live on paired with another Sacrifice (Kettricken) and still be able to have a father's role in their lives.<br /><br />It also seemed as though there would be more to come from Web. He knew so much it seemed as though he would have to reveal who and what he was. I doubt that just being an old soul of the Old Blood was allhe was. And if that was all he was he still had something significant to contribute beyond random insight and confronting people with Truth.<br /><br />I loved this series to the end in spite of it changing course. I would not discourage people from reading it and I would allow people to finish it before sharing my thoughts about the ending. Yet it is not right to give this a rating that does not reflect my reservations. It is not a blanket 5 star book. It is a flawed installment that does not truly fit together with the other pieces. Initially I rated all of the books in the series with 5 stars. I have since reconsidered and changed Fool's Fate to 3 stars. It is a great book as long as it followed its original course. Once it went in a direction inconsistent with everything plausible within the story's reality it dropped to a 3.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|I loved the book when I read it. The film is just as good. Not much else to say. Another film that is just too scary because it is possible to happen for real. Yikes!

B001OQCV2E|4.0|I looked forward to seeing this film before it was released on DVD. When it begins you wonder where it is going, but once the action starts that is when the film really begins. It starts off with a bang at that time, then, unfortunately slows down, but it is entertaining just the same. The best reason to enjoy it, and also to be afraid of it is that it can happen. Enjoyable. If you're into disaster films, you'll enjoy this one. Either way, it is worth a look. The special effects are mesmerizing to see, especially when you see an aircraft carrier wash shore.

B00338QENI|2.0|This book is interesting, but goes into too much medical jargon, in my opinion. Sad that the family never received any compensation.
0547569653|5.0|Enjoying this book thoroughly.  About 2/3'rds way done.  Great advice for anyone interested in a vegetarian or vegan or raw food diet interested also in ultra running, which I am.  He's not preachy or too \\"new-agey,\\" and it's amazing the research and reading he's done to formulate his own theories.  His story is interesting and has kept me looking forward to a few more pages here and there.  Got me back on track with diet and running after my last ultra relay run. Going for a 50 miler now - really needed some inspiration.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I had this game on my iphone (paid 99 cents) roughly a year ago and what really makes the game addicting is the 3 objectives you are given to complete, it's always changing so it keeps you busy. Wish they released this game a lot sooner since it's top notch. Hopefully half brick releases more apps for Android.
B001SS3JS8|4.0|This is not a \\"feel good\\" kind of book. It's dark and you will experience many different emotions throughout reading it, which is what I loved about it! It grabs your attention, and weeks later I am still pondering the psyche of the characters.
B0086700CM|4.0|&quot;Temple Run&quot; is a great game - and I only got the free version! In &quot;Temple Run,&quot; you play as a collection of characters that race through a temple, escaping demon monkeys while collecting coins, ducking under trees, jumping over crevices and collecting unlockable items. I think there should be an extended, console version for the 3DS or PSVita or something - I know I'd buy it. And you should, too. My only quip - boring character models and the lack of a story. Then again, I got the free version, so if the full version has these, then I'll definitely get it.
030758836X|5.0|Wow. Wow. Wow. This book blew my mind. I kept thinking I knew where it was going. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Great writing, great plot, fully developed characters, terrific read.
1250000971|4.0|\\"The Sins of the Father\\", like all of Jeffrey Archer's books, does not have violence except what is needed for the plot line, but you keep guessing about the twists and turns as the story progresses.  There are strong characters who develop using a timeline for their adventures.  This was the middle book of a trilogy and it was a read I could not put down.  I read the last half of the book until 2:00 a.m.  The end became predictable for me but it left me wanting more, Book Three. This was a good summer book for me.<br /><br />This book developed Emma's character showing her tenacity.  I do wish there had been a little more about the two main characters and their escapades during WWII, but Lord Archer's books usually deal with politics, greed and business manipulations.  I've always liked his books because of his style of writing.<br /><br />When I began reading \\"Only Time Will Tell\\", I knew it was the first book in a trilogy.  I am looking forward to Book 3 of the Clifton Chronicles, which will answer questions that ended in this book's cliff hanger ending.  Of course, the reader knows where that book will begin, but that's okay.

1606995359|5.0|Only a Poor Old Man, the second volume in Fantagraphics ongoing series to reprint all of Carl Barks' Disney comic book work, looks very good.  It corrects most of the relatively minor flaws I found in the first volume, Lost in the Andes.  Sometimes a few shading lines are missing compared to the original comic books.  This seems a little odd but perhaps they were very fine lines in the original art that were strengthened by the somewhat heavier printing in the original.  Where there are such differences, they seem to match the Carl Barks Library.  For example there is a lower eyelid added to Scrooge's right eye in page 3 panel 8 in this book and the CBL that does not appear in the original comic book.  And the missing shading in page 2 panel 7 matches the missing shading in the CBL, not the comic book.  But there are also places where more detail is visible in the CBL and here than the original comic book, for example in the shading of the back of Scrooge's chair on page 3, shading detail is apparent which was obscured by the heavier printing in the original.  The coloring largely is quite similar to the original and does honor to it and I have not noticed in my non-exhaustive comparison of original to reprint any changes for the worse.  The excessively gold yellow of  LOST IN THE ANDES has been replaced by a yellow more true to the original, but OFTEN the yellow is too intense compared to the original.  If they are using 100% yellow for backgrounds, they could be brought much closer to the original by cutting back to 75% or 50%.  Where yellow is mixed with Cyan or Magenta to produce the other colors of the spectrum, the match to the original is much better than when the yellow plate is by itself.  The registration and printing quality are significantly better here than in the original comic books though these early 1950s comic books were much better in that respect than the comics of the late 1960s and 1970s.  The size of the image on the page is very close to original and to be honest the difference is so small you need to lay the pages edge to edge to see the difference.<br /><br />The Beagle Boys in blue shirts on the cover?  Well, that is how they appeared in the original comic book.<br /><br />Having the gag pages printed with the stories instead of isolated is an improvement.  Now if they would just put the covers with the stories!<br /><br />If you want to read the first six issues of Carl Barks' Uncle Scrooge stories more or less as readers 60 years ago first saw them, buy this book.  There is one very important difference.  Back to the Klondike, in the second Uncle Scrooge comic book, was originally published with 5 pages censored out.  What was excised was pretty tame stuff by more modern standards, and even compared to publishers other than Dell, but those missing pages have been restored in this printing, as in all others since the publication of the CBL in the middle 1980s.<br /><br />NOTE: The story in Uncle Scrooge #6, starting on page 205 of this book, is a rewritten and reused version of a Barney Bear and Benny Burro story Barks did in Our Gang Comics #35, starting on page 201 of [[ASIN:1600109292 Carl Barks Big  Book of Barney Bear]], which I have also reviewed. Barks' duck work is generally better than his non-Disney work, and this is no exception, but the earlier version is an interesting footnote.<br /><br />ADDENDUM, 11/29/13: In [[ASIN:1606996975 Walt Disney's Donald Duck: \\"Christmas On Bear Mountain\\" (The Complete Carl Barks Disney Library)]], volume 5 of the series in both publication order and chronological sequence, the overly intense yellows in previous volumes (the present Uncle Scrooge, volume 12, plus 11 & 6) have all but disappeared, appearing on only a few scattered pages; and even volume 6 was a great improvement on earlier volumes. And the excessively gold \\"yellow\\" in volume 7 [[ASIN:1606994743 Walt Disney's Donald Duck: \\"Lost in the Andes\\" (Vol. 7)  (The Complete Carl Barks Disney Library)]], fortunately, appears nowhere else. Perhaps that can be corrected when there is a true Second Edition (not just a second printing) of that book which also restores Carl Barks' original version of Race to the South Seas. Volume 5 was published earlier this month and, like the other volumes, is highly recommended.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|I have no idea why this book has gotten so popular.  It's an interesting idea and plot idea, but it's too poorly written to be enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I know a lot has been said about the erotic sex in this book and its other 2 in the trilogy but, even though I enjoyed that aspect of the story, I feel the underlying story and love between Ana & Christian is beautiful. He has such a dark past yet she is brave and strong enough to look past that and, with love, bring him into the light. She teaches him that he is loved and he already knows how to love, he just didn't realize it. She is gentle with him when it's needed yet tough when it is needed also. She's willing to try his acts but, sets a limit to what she'll do. Through these she learns what makes him tick, per se. I found these three books very enjoyable and engrossing and wish there were more to read. These two make a beautiful couple.

1595141715|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher is one of those books that I have been meaning to pick up and read for what feels like forever. When I found it at my favorite used book store a  month ago, I instantly snatched it up.  While I can't say I exactly 'enjoyed' it, I am glad I finally read this book. This book broke my heart but I had to finish it, to find out what it was that pushed Hannah into feeling like suicide was the only answer for her.<br /><br />With a dual narrative, this tale unfolds in a very unique way. We see the story through the eyes of Clay, one of the recipients of Hannah's tapes, and we hear Hannah's reasons as he does. The book spans the course of a day and I was completely sucked in from the beginning. It's extremely well written, though it is definitely different from anything else I've ever read.<br /><br />I can say for sure that I will never forget this book, it has sunk it's teeth into my heart and I'll be contemplating it for some time. The message in the pages is an important one and I think as hard as it is to read this girl's goodbye to a world that seemed determined to keep her down, you simply HAVE to read it. All teens should be made to read this book. Asher has touched on a difficult, but all too common issue that needs to be addressed.<br /><br />Well written, thought provoking and emotional, this book will keep you riveted from beginning to end. Even though you know Hannah's ending, there are still a few surprises mixed in that will leave you feeling hollow and aching, but hopeful.  Kudos to Jay Asher, this book is a must read. ~Mel

B007J4T2G8|4.0|The author was definitely after the shock value on the sex scenes.  What virgin would really jump into sex where almost anything goes?  Didn't need to go this far in order to establish that Grey is a disfunctional character.  I have heard from friends that books 2 and 3 are much better with not so much of the shock factor.  A story line does exist beneath the surface and I would like to know more about how Grey became so disfunctional and find out if he can overcome.

B004JN1D2I|3.0|Essentially, the stories and text formatting are great. The problem is that the publisher/Amazon weren't bright enough to realize that the page count system didn't go beyond the first book, and the books aren't separate out well. So after you finish the first book, you are just estimating how far along you are in the next books, which is a little annoying but not the end of the world.

0307959856|3.0|This is my first time reading anything by P.D. James.  I can tell from the writing and the thought process of putting a novel together like this that the accolades given to her over the years has been warranted.  However, I cannot say that this was one of my favorite reads.  I started this book several months ago (when it first came out) and could not get any farther than about the first 4 or 5 chapters. Although I like Victorian era novels and those set back in the 1800's, I found this text a bit hard going.  Once I got past the first section of this book (it is divided into sections of content related to the story), and really into the murder then the reading got easier.<br /><br />What I find always interesting is that characters from this era never really say what they mean or do what they really think they should do.  There is always this reserve in terms of what is appropriate related to gender and class.  Again I think it boils down to choices that people make or don't make that result in tragedy for many.  This is the same for the characters in this book.  As other reviewers have said, this is a spin off from the characters in Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice. James was successful in making the content of this book her own.  In the end, the story conclusion was not really a surprise and although I think that it was detailed, it still left me thinking, \\"was that all?\\"  In truth the two common things that bring people down to a base level and where our ugliest behavior and true natures come out surround the issues of sex and money (or greed).  It was no different in this novel.  The only difference was in how much reading and how hard it was to decipher all of the rhetoric to finally get to the sum and substance of the whole endeavor. I think my opinion is pretty much in line with the overall rating that this book has received in aggregate and that is, it is OK; not great, not the worst murder novel I have read but also not the best.  I was expecting more from this author knowing about her exceptional writing career.

B005HSL626|3.0|I really enjoyed this game until the latest update... which refuses to open unless there's an internet connection available. This was news to me, since previous versions ran fine without an internet connection.<br /><br />The game is also installed on my phone, but will not open when the phone is in airplane mode.<br />I don't love it enough to buy the paid version, especially if that too will require a connection; I play for fun, and have no interest in the leaderboards etc. and certainly don't want to spend my data allotment on ads.

B00005Y1UX|4.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Indecent Proposal\\" starring Robert Redford, Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson. It was a highly improbable fantasy-type movie that couldn't possibly happen, if you stop to think about it. So don't stop and think about it. Just relax and enjoy a rather good story. Harrelson and Moore played a happily married couple who were working on their own little dream castle property. When a steep recession came along, they both lost their jobs, their project came to a halt and the property went into default. In short, their financial socks were shrinking down into their shoes. In a last-minute effort, they took the remaining $5,000 they had and went to Las Vegas to see if they could run it up to what they needed (about $50,000). Well, you know how that goes. The first night they ran it up to $30,000, but dropped back down the following night. In the meantime, Moore accidentally met Redford, who played a dashing Las Vegas billionaire. He thought nothing of dropping millions of dollars on the gambling tables, but that's because he had billions. It's then that he made an indecent proposal. He'll give her a million dollars for a night's \\"entertainment.\\"<br /><br />The couple reacted with a resounding \\"No!\\" to the proposal, as you might expect. But then they thought it over. A million dollars would fix all their financial problems for the rest of their lives. After some discussion, they decided to go through with the offer. That's when the agony set in. A gulf quickly developed between the married couple and became wider and wider. Furthermore, Redford enjoyed the evening enough that he turned into something of a well-heeled stalker. And then the real agony set in.<br /><br />It's an interesting premise, albeit a complete fantasy. It's quite emotion grabbing, however. It will hold your attention. The movie is well done and well presented. You may think about it for a while afterwards.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was hot, hot, hot!  There is love, power, money, mystery, action, humor, and of course sex!  If sex is just a \\"vanilla thing\\" for you, then perhaps you may learn something, even if its just to satisfy your curious mind. But don't let the sex scenes intimidate you.  This book is about so much more. That Christian Grey is something else! I'm really not a regular reader, but this book held my attention through the entire trilogy.  I finished the entire series in 2 weeks, and I have a full life with a full time job. Yes, its that good!  Try it!  You might like it!

B0085Z3B2Q|3.0|Having seen the earlier version of the Lorax, the new one pales in comparison. The original Lorax had some of the best artwork and color palette of any animated film to date. The film was aesthetically pleasing to the core.<br /><br />The new version is formulaic. The artwork is actually pretty good, but the story and pacing are uninspired and uninteresting. There is also a very serious, realistic tone to the new film (i.e. character mannerisms, music, etc) that ruin it. The old version had an almost \\"magical\\" look and feel to it.

B008602KQI|3.0|One of the perquisites of not being a fanboy/girl is impartiality. I don't have anything invested in the written works, the actors, or the viability of the franchise. In fact, until I read that this was the heir apparent, supplanting the vampires as reigning teen icons and representing a film for their generation - I had never heard of the term, the books or the author. All I have is what the film presented and delivered.<br /><br />If you haven't yet read the source novels, in essence: Nearly three-quarters of a century have passed since a terrible war. And the victors have set a terrible condition for the defeated. As a constant reminder and warning to never again rebel - they're forced to make an annual tribute - once a year they have to offer up their children as sacrifice. The rebellion encompassed twelve regions or zones, and from each zone one boy and one girl are selected by random drawing. The twenty-four youths, between the ages of 12-16, are then trained as warriors. After which, they're sent into a staged arena where only one survivor can emerge from the proscribed game enclosure. Fight to the death, kill all the others, and the sole remaining child is allowed to live.<br /><br />The passage of years has seen the game transform from punitive reminder into populist spectacle - where millions cheer, gamble and watch the children battle with one another using blades, explosives, and a variety of primitive weapons. State sanctioned bloodsport has now become the all-time favorite reality televised program.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot holes were numerous and the film dragged in many places. But I was willing to ignore most of the minor failings in favor of enjoying the tale, which is essentially a revised take on the original '[[ASIN:0792838300 Rollerball]]' story by Jewison and Harrison.<br /><br />And star Jennifer Lawrence made the most of the role. I'm appreciative that the producers didn't go for an actress that was just 'pretty'. I understand several such physically attractive performers were considered for the job. Thankfully, they selected a young woman whom I would categorize as a simple beauty - beautiful beyond the superficial, of which there seems to be an sad unending supply in Hollywood.<br /><br />Overall, this wasn't bad, just pedestrian. I hope the producers hire a more appropriate director or guide the current one with more input from actual 'hunters', helping to sidestep tropes and errors of the genre which Director Gary Ross did not or could not avoid for this first installment in the series. See below for movie recommendations.<br /><br />Minor irks:<br /><br />- Very odd editing. If this is a television show, the producer didn't seem particularly concerned in keeping the flow of action steady, allowing ludicrous periods of inactivity. Today in 2012, never mind the future, audiences are notably impatient and click-happy; it's extremely difficult to imagine they would wait around for hours, even days at a time, for anything to happen. And equally strange, Director Ross seemed to disconnect the audience itself as a participant in the drama - rarely showing the effect as various players were eliminated or victorious. Just very odd.<br /><br />- The training sequence was wholly inadequate, almost laughable. Clearly, Ross didn't hire a proper advisor. Simply adding a SpecOps veteran or a primitive skills instructor to his staff would've immeasurably helped that important sequence. Or he could've have just as easily watched something like '[[ASIN:1558908315 G.I. Jane]]' or '[[ASIN:B00005V1WY Barabbas]]' to see how this should've been done. A definite missed opportunity for kickass-ness. Really unfortunate.<br /><br />- Without any background to draw upon, the film's premise left out quite a bit of history - a plot hole that I suspect could've easily been covered with just a few more sentences during the intro. My guess, based entirely on the opening scenes, was a Second Civil War - with the 'Union'forces less forgiving the second time 'round. If that assessment is correct, then it would've been very easy to incorporate into the plot, giving us much needed depth and a fuller appreciation for the story without having to add anything significant to either the frame time or the budget.<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- To see how this screenplay could have been better executed, I strongly recommend checking out \\"[[ASIN:B002FOFX9C The Tournament]]\\" with Ving Rhames and Kelly Hu -or- \\"[[ASIN:B000SM6FKY The Condemned]]\\" with Steve Austin.forces less forgiving the second time 'round.

030758836X|5.0|I shall tell the reader nothing about this book because I do not want to spoil the great enjoyment and surprise with the twists and turns at least four times in the book.  I read mysteries on my Kindle voraciously and take them wherever I go.  However, with Gone Girl, I refused to move from my chair until I had finished it.  I missed a dinner out and a shopping trip and regretted the losses not one bit.  This is a book that seems so real, and it scared me to death not because of violence but because of its real possibilities.  I know this is vague, but trust a book addicted reader that this is one a mystery lover will not soon forget.  I am going to look for other books by G. Flynn right now.

B008602KQI|2.0|Where should I start?  This movie sucked so hard I felt I had been robbed $3.99!  The hype for this movie left me wanting to see it.  It failed completely.  There is very little consistency in the story line.  The \\"rules\\" of the game are changed, changed again, then changed back again, and then thrown out completely.  They announce that there will only be one announcement during the game, then they make 4 more.  The plot/storyline was so easy to read ten minutes into the future. Only two words describe this movie;  lame & ripoff.  I would recommend waiting till the rights of the movie expire, then watch it for free when you have nothing else to do.  I hope there will not be a sequel.

Where's the character development? Where is the overcoming of adversity? She's an odds on favorite from the start. Everyone she meets is impressed by her. Competitors rescue her. Boys love her. The only ones that dislike her are a couple of ridiculously ineffectual adults.<br /><br />But I suppose this is a \\"competition story\\" for a generation raised on the philosophy of \\"there are no losers\\" that everyone wins and gets to be in first place. The other competitors in the story aren't human beings that live, and feel and die when they lose, they're speed bumps on the road to \\"high self esteem\\" for self centered main character.<br /><br />If this is \\"nobility\\" that youth these days aspires to, one where victory is handed out with no cost, where there are never any significant setbacks, where no one else is as \\"real\\" as you and the expectation is that people will simply sacrifice themselves for your triumph, then I weep for the future.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|There was a point in this book that I got so bored, I put it down not knowing when I will finish it, nor did I care if I ever did finish it or not. The sex scenes were no longer exciting because by the third book, they'd covered about everything with that part. My co-worker convinced me to start reading again because after you get through about the middle of the book, it gets exciting.  She was right. It did start getting exciting again (and I don't mean the sex parts) and I even got to the point that I couldn't put it down.

I first bought this cd in the summer of 2007 after buying a magazine that listed the best prog albums of all time and this one ranked high. Well aside from the title track and a few other tunes i could not stand this album it was a very diffacult listen with no rewards. I do prefer the earlier albums like Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot and Selling England By The Pound. I may have to give this album a fourth listen sometime soon i see all of the positive reviews for it. Sometimes i love Peter Gabriel and all his madness and other times some of his stuff is weird for the sake of being weird that i dont like. This album seems exactly that way plain strange and not in a good way.

0553386794|5.0|This book is truly amazing. It has so many layers in it and the characters are extremely well thought out. What I especially like about it is the fact that none of the characters (apart from few exceptions) can be categorized as purely \\"evil\\" or \\"good\\", instead they appear to be very human. One moment you feel you hate one of them, and the next moment you love that person. This is how it is in real life, things are rarely black and white; people are not perfect, we all make mistakes and misjudgments time to time. I think that is one of the reasons why this book is so fascinating: It is so easy to relate to the characters, and even though you do not always like their decisions, you can still understand why they behave in a certain way in certain situations.<br /><br />For the first time I cannot name one particular character as my absolute favorite, there are so many great characters in this book that it would be impossible to point out who I love the most, each of them is different and has his/her unique charm. I absolutely recommend this book to everyone who loves a great read.
1583334386|5.0|A lot of self-help books attempt to be inspirational but aren't very practical. This book explains the mental and emotional processes behind willpower failures taken from scientific studies. Then it gives tips for and examples of how to counteract these processes taken from participants in the author's classes who have successfully exercised willpower.<br /><br />Some of the advice is counterintuitive. For example, being hard on yourself after a lapse leads to a spiral of guilt and further lapses. The best thing to do is forgive yourself, then get back to focusing on your goal. Thinking about your actions as morally \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" instead of effective or ineffective at reaching a goal sets you up to give yourself permission to be a little bit \\"bad\\" after having been \\"good.\\" Imagining success is not as effective as imagining failure. The latter more effectively prepares you for facing temptation.<br /><br />The author has a realistic understanding of human nature and a good sense of humor. At the beginning of the book, she states that willpower is limited because it takes mental effort, but it becomes easier as effective strategies become habits.<br /><br />I like this book so much I'm buying a copy for a friend.

B005MYEQ4U|3.0|I knew that not everything have to be convincible in a movie. But I do not feel Gil and Inez can be a couple and ready to marry. I do not believe that Adriana  can attract to Gil. It is strange that Gabrielle will walk with Gil in the rain in the final scene. Unless Woody Allen do not know what is love.<br /><br />After watching the movie for 15 minutes I was in the verge of stopping the movie and switching to Yankee game. The motivation keeping me watching it is I like Marion Cotillard. She is so charming and her beauty is not comparable.<br /><br />I will not steal my girlfriend or wife's jewellery for other woman's gift. The earring scene can be deleted. Gil purchased another rings. Adriana said she liked it even without taking a closer look.<br /><br />Most of the actors and actress are superb so I give 3 stars othwise 2 stars is sufficient.

B008M4MB8K|5.0|A five disc version set of the film including the theatrical release, alternate cuts, the work print and the documentary \\"Dangerous Days,\\" was released on Blu-ray in 2007. If you already own that release, like I do, then I would suggest waiting to see the official reviews on the video and audio quality on the new set before forking over more money.<br /><br />The new gift set looks cool. A gift set was released before on DVD with different packaging. There is however a new booklet and other memorabilia included in the 2012 Blu-ray release gift set.<br /><br />I own the lone Director's Cut (DVD), which for me was fine and still is. It also was the only version one could purchase and was supposedly preferred by Ridley Scott as the \\"definitive version,\\" of the film at the time.<br /><br />I own the four disc DVD collection without the work print. The included work print plus an audio/video upgrade was the reason I then purchased the 2007 five disc set on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Blade Runner, is an outstanding film all around. The film stands the test of time regardless of which alternative cut you watch, IMO. I would argue whether this release is a \\"definitive release,\\" considering the previous releases. Regardless, hopefully this release will be the last one.

0240815807|5.0|Read rave reviews about this item so I decided to make the purchase. I'm half way through the book & already learned a great deal of knowledge. Like the difference between Ported / Unported Nearfield Monitors, Suppplementary Monitoring (Headphones) to name a few. I wish this book had been out a lot sooner. It would had saved a lot of time & money with better results. Well worth the money for what i've learned so far & still have much more to learn. If you're like me & record in your spare room / den, then this book is for you! This material is every Home Studio Producer's Bible...GET IT NOW!!!!

B0068LYEHA|5.0|Intelligently funny, hard to put down, with tidbits of homage to sundry feminists before her.  Sharp, current-day experiential insight any woman can appreciate, yet also revisits those tumultuous pubescent years with laugh out loud humor right along side her - a must read!
0439023513|1.0|I loved HG and CF, I couldn't put those books down. I spent hours of just reading. So I was thinking that the third book would be a epic ending to rival any book great book series. But I was wrong. I felt the Collins just sucked all feeling out of Katniss and gave us a emotionless human. She seemed to be a shadow of the fiery girl she was in the beginning. Not only that, but her relationship with Peeta and Gale seemed unnecessary and pointless. Her relationship with Peeta seemed forced and was adding for no reason. She didn't even seem in love with him.<br />My other gripe was with unexplained death of President Snow, you would think it would be a \\"This is Sparta\\" moment of triumph. But no instead we find out he was randomly found death, no explanation was given for his death. Then you have the death of Primrose and Gale, and Katniss doesn't even flinch or show any emotion to their death. It seemed that Mockingjay lost it's adventure and fiery feeling, and felt for depressing and I just had to force myself to finish the book. I regret reading Mockingjay, it could have been a much better book. I did feel like the ending was meant to be. I wasn't expecting a fairytale ending.
1451673442|5.0|I read at least one self-help book a week for my radio show. Over the past 5 years I've read almost 300 books. There are so many that I have found to be excellent and well worth reading. This one however is, by far, the BEST self-help book I have ever read.<br /><br />We're here to find joy and give joy. Having said that, it's a whole lot easier to be of joy and bring joy to others when we live from our hearts, live in gratitude and stay positive. Sometimes that's challenging, after all, we are human. It can be accomplished more easily though, when the practices in The Magic become a part of your life.<br /><br />I followed it precisely. It is NOT hard, it is NOT overly time consuming. As a matter of fact, I incorporated it into my 20 year gratitude practice and found that my life was changing dramatically after only 3, yes, that's right, THREE, days.<br /><br />Now, I write in my gratitude journal daily and I have not missed a day in 20 years. THIS takes it to a much higher level. I have gained a whole new perspective and clearly, that is what I needed in my life, only I didn't know it until I started doing the practices.<br /><br />It is so easy to do this practice each and every day. Buy this book knowing that you WILL follow it, each and every day for 28 days. Don't give up. Allow yourself the gift of 28 days of this practice. It is one of the greatest gift you will ever give yourself because it is life altering on every level.<br /><br />I committed to the practice and did it first thing every single morning with the exception of one. That day, I had no choice but to do the practice in the afternoon and I made sure I did it that day as by noon time, I was already feeling a difference in how the day was going and I was only on day 7. I knew I didn't want to miss a day, I fully committed myself and as I said, it's not a long practice at all, you just need to DO IT.<br /><br />I feel it's much easier to do this with someone. Two of my friends and I did it - we live far from each other but we'd call each other a few times a week, or, when we noticed something magical happen. By the way, we all noticed that many magical things were happening in our lives and we needed to share the amazement so we were in touch more so than usual.<br /><br />It is well worth it to buddy up with someone so you won't give up. My two friends both admitted they would have given up because life was getting in the way. For one friend, who is excessively busy with her career, it seemed almost understandable that she would give up. My other friend is retired and said if we were not all doing it together, she too, would have given up. I don't know if I would have or not. I LOVE this practice. It keeps me focused and I opted to do it each morning because it really set a great tone to the day for me. Since we all did it together - we kept each other going, though again, I did not find it hard to keep going.<br /><br />My career busy friend is a few days behind because things came up and she just did not have the time on those days to do the practice. She did keep going as she really liked it and she was noticing a significant difference in her life.<br /><br />My retired friend is still doing the practice as well but she read ahead and ended up doing the same practice a few times so she's about 10 days behind. Still, she continues to proceed and she loves it.<br /><br />You know what? It just doesn't matter if you skip a day, or do some of the practices twice in a row. It really doesn't matter because where you are is where you're meant to be and maybe doing a specific practice more than once is just what you need to do. The important thing to remember is to just keep going until you have done all 28 days.<br /><br />Amazingly, after two weeks I mentioned to both friends that I loved it so much, I was thinking I would start all over again when I was done. BOTH agreed and told me they, too, had already had that exact same thought.<br /><br />I finished the28 days before writing this review and I find I will be starting again only this time, I'll do it a bit differently. I am going to open the book to see what practice I am being guided to do each day. Whatever page I open to, that is the practice I shall do. I believe that way, having gone through the practice in order and in its' entirely once, I may see patterns as to the areas where I need to make improvements. Just my thought about how I can help myself even more.<br /><br />In all honesty, I was not a great fan of Ms. Byrnes first two books. They were okay but I felt something was missing. THIS IS IT! This is what was missing. The MAGIC was missing.<br /><br />I would not have purchased this book if it were not for my career friend who also said she would not have picked it up if it had not kept popping up in front of her at the library one day. You know how the Universe provides us with signs, right? She never goes to the library but a friend needed to return books while they were out and so she went in. Apparently, this book showed up a few times in various places in the library. That's not normal. She's aware of signs and decided to go back and look at it. Having done that, she decided she'd go buy the book and then for some reason, I popped into her head and she called to tell me about it. Remember, we do not live near each other. It sounded good to me so I told her I would do it with her and purchased the book through Amazon. I got the book a few days later and then told my retired friend about it. She bought her copy and that's how it all started.<br /><br />I'm also a little picky about the authors I have on my radio show. I need to not just like the book, I need to see a true value for my listeners as well. Though I have not had Ms. Byrne's on as a guest, I highly recommend this book, The Magic, as THE ONE TO BUY if you are truly looking for life changes. It is indeed transformational and it is NOT at all difficult to incorporate into your daily routine. As a matter of fact, I found a lot of the practices to be FUN, inspiring and eye opening! Seriously, the practice will inspire your creativity. It does take time to do the practice but then anything worthwhile does. Keep in mind though, it really doesn't take a lot of time. Once the habit is formed you will miss it if you don't do it and you will notice a difference in your day to day activities between when you do the practice and when you do not. It truly is amazing and magical how that works.<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you, I do LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book! I have found that the magic is everywhere. I only needed to put it into practice properly so I could see the magical changes happening in every area of my life.<br /><br />Follow the practices in The Magic, it really will transform your life.<br /><br />UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE  October 1, 2012<br /><br />You know what they say about making plans in your life? The God of my understanding had something else in mind. I wrote above that I was going to do The Magic a second time only do it differently. That didn't happen. I told a few people about it while I waited for the other two women to finish with their first cycle. Well, I told enough people that I had a group of 12, across the USA, all starting on the same day. I put a distribution list together and we all share, only if you want to, what magical things are occurring in our lives. As that cycle progressed, I was brought more people to tell and now, there is a group of 27 of us, all across the USA, who are doing the practices.<br /><br />My intent to just open the book and see what I needed for the day seems to not be what is needed at all. I love this practice so much that I bought a leather book cover (OMG it was pricey but worth it) for my book because it's not available in hard cover and I want to preserve this book. It's filled with my energy and I know me, I'll be doing this practice over and over for the rest of my life.<br /><br />The next cycle already has a bunch of new people who will be joining those of us from the first, second, and third cycles who want to do it again - ~99%. That's incredible.<br /><br />Now, I have a list of people who want to be part of this \\"club\\" which has no membership fees, no meetings, no rules, no mandatory checking in - it's just a group of people, men and women, who want to feel the support of everyone else who is also going through the practices. None of us want to let anyone else down and that's what keeps us all on track. Terrific support that is truly having amazing effects and every person is feeling lighter, happier, more positive and able to handle life's challenges in a whole new way that serves everyone really well.<br /><br />Oh, and the best part? We think we can change people, right? You can't, we've probably all learned this. If you follow these practices, you don't need to change anyone. They automatically change. It is unreal. They change because you are changing. I noticed it and then people in the group shared that they noticed other people around them were changing as well. I am totally serious. It's absolutely true.<br /><br />This book is the best gift anyone could give to themselves or someone else. Based on the people I'm talking to and those in the group, Amazon will need to re-order because those of us who have done this, KNOW, it's the best gift to give. THIS is priceless and life changing. This is what I'm giving this year - no joke!<br /><br />I can only imagine how much better this world would be if governments made this mandatory reading.<br /><br />I'm gratefully amazed. Putting together the group really worked well because group energy is strong and when someone shares, everyone benefits from that positive energy. Very cool book - Rhonda Byrnes NAILED IT!<br /><br />Get a buddy and start together or build a group on your own. It's extremely beneficial.<br /><br />When given a job, I do it and get it done. I'm a Just Do It girl.Buy the book. JUST DO IT! You will be so glad you did.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|great and awesome. works really well for me. easy to use and yhe favorite button is very helpful. and its free
044654759X|5.0|bought this book for mom, Sparks is one of her favorite authors and has all of his books, she loved the story.
B005R32L66|2.0|Amazon Appstore's version is ok, but doesn't allow the other person to see you. To get an updated version, Google search Skype_2.1.0 .46.apk .  I was able to download this version from 4shared.com (or something close to that that will be listed from the search). I hope this helps!!
B0088X7YU0|4.0|I have a lot of respect for the work of Shinji Aramaki.  I have loved the work he has done to bridge the gap of great anime and regular movies with some great CGI work.  The CGI in this movie is top notch!  I really like how he went the western style CGI, rather than the anime cell shading, to create a great piece of realism through the CGI work.  Much of the time, I had to question how much was really CGI.  The CGI was very lifelike.<br /><br />It was awesome to see the same characters back from the originals, but I wish he made them look a little more like the original characters.  It would have helped to really grasp the continuation of characters from the past.  By the end of the movie, I knew who everyone was...but would have liked to see the character the first time and know who he was.  It would have sparked a bit of emotion for anyone who's seen all the other movies.<br /><br />The movie was great.  But, I was easily won over by the quality of everything that went into the movie rather than story.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and now know my preorder (which I should have in a week) was worth it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Appleseed movies, Final Fantasy the Spirits Within, and others in the same genre/category, you should enjoy this movie quite a bit!  Definitely a movie worth getting and is at a good reasonable price!
0345803493|5.0|From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance<br /><br />At a Glance<br />I truly feel that if you didn't like the first book, you might just like this one. Fifty Shades Darker is less BDSM and more romance with some kink. We see Christian in a whole new light and Ana has really grown into her own.<br /><br />The Good<br />Here's the Story...<br />So, at the end of Fifty Shades of Grey, Ana finally leaves Christian. And you can't really blame her. She is just not ready for the kind of relationship he needs. But only days apart, both of them find they can't live without the other. Now Christian is a whole new man. As long as he has Ana by his side, he doesn't need the whole Dom and Sub deal. And though Ana loves the new Christian, she can't help but feel like she will never be able to fulfill Christian's every need. But now the tables have turned. Ana starts craving those nights of erotic play. But Christian doesn't want to risk losing her again. So what does a girl have to do to get a spanking around here? Answer: stir the beast. And that's exactly what Ana does. But even with the kink back on, Ana still worries about Christian's exes. What if one day Christian realizes he wants his old life back and runs back to one of his subs, or ever Mrs. Robinson? With the added stress of a new job and a new boss that is a little too friendly, Ana is just waiting for the next ball to drop.<br /><br />Ana...<br />Though I feel Ana capitulated a little too fast when it came to getting back with Christian, I am happy she did. Christian has changed for the better, but I will get back to him later. Let's talk Ana. Ana's life is starting to really take off. She is starting a new dream job at a publishing company, she lives in a nice house with her best friend, and she has a rich boyfriend. Suffice it to say, I want her life. She has also really come into her own sexually. Ana realizes that she likes the erotic side of sex. She is more often than not the instigator of her and Christian's kinky sex. I was happy to see this more open minded Ana. She is also hard at work trying to figure out what happened to her poor Fifty Shades that made him turn to the life he did. Why must he dominate, why must he have all the control? And when the truth is revealed, Ana only loves Christian more, faults and all.<br /><br />Fifty Shades...<br />Christian really opens up this time around. We get to see all sides of him: playful, mischievous, shy, sweet, romantic, and loving. He doesn't hold anything back. He has lost Ana once, he is not going to let that happen again. And though he has trouble saying the words, Christian does all he can to show Ana he loves her. They actually start dating, doing things couples do, well, what insanely rich couples do. There are a few scenes that had a very The Thomas Crown Affair feel (the one with Pierce Brosnan. Mmmmm...Pierce Brosnan). Christian also becomes rawer and vulnerable in this book. He is needier, never wanting to be away from Ana. His self-abhorrence is also more evident. He slowly reveals more about his past and you can't help but feel for him. Pretty much everything comes to the surface and Ana sticks by his side every step of the way.<br /><br />If you loved the controlling, dominate, darker Christian, don't worry, he is still all of those things...but in a softer more vulnerable way. I liked this boyish version of Christian. I think he was always meant to be more carefree and loving but life had changed him. I see the real Christian poking through in Fifty Shades Darker.<br /><br />From Lust to Love...<br />This book has a different feel from the first book. Fifty Shades of Grey was about domination, sexual awakening, and lust. Fifty Shades Darker is about a couple who are trying to work on a mostly healthy, but highly sexual relationship. We get to witness an adorable couple having fun, having fights, and working on their issues. Like I said before, Ana's easy capitulation into getting back withChristian scared me, but I am so happy she did. He really has changed. It's nice to watch a man do anything to stay with his woman, to do anything for her love.<br /><br />Intruders...<br />I am happy to report there is more of a plot this time around. We learn more about that damn Mrs. Robinson as she inserts herself into Christian's life once again. As you can imagine, Ana does not like this. But Mrs. Robinson is Christian's only friend, so Ana is reluctant to ruin that for him. Then there is the crazy ex-sub that is jealous of Ana's relationship with Christian. And last is Ana's boss who might be more sinister than he appears. I liked these added elements to the story. It gave the book better plot flow.<br /><br />The Bad<br />I have to say, Ana was very immature in the first half of Fifty Shades Darker. And her \\"Inner Goddess\\" got a lot more annoying.<br /><br />The constant smirking was a little overdone. We get it, Christian is a smirker because he's so mysterious and playful. I got over it about 1/3 way into the book.<br /><br />The obsession Ana and Christian have for one another can be a little unnerving sometimes. To love someone is one thing, to not be able to function without them is another.<br /><br />The Snuggly<br />The sex is a lot more toned down. It's still steamy, but we get more romance and less BDSM. Christian is a lot more receptive to having a \\"normal\\" relationship with Ana, so he doesn't risk it by asking for more kink. It's Ana, this time around, who initiates the kinky sex. I liked how Ana opened herself up to experimenting.<br /><br />Overall<br />I loved this book as much as Fifty Shades of Grey. It definitely has a different feel, but overall Fifty Shades Darker was a great read. I am very happy over the progression in Ana and Christian's relationship, and the new characters spiced things up nicely. Highly recommended.Christian scared me, but I am so happy she did.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|I thought this movie was very good. I felt that it really drew you into a different time period. The acting was top notch and the message of the movie is one I think more people should live their lives by. That being said, this is not a documentary and there are events in this movie which are either ambiguous or downright untrue. However, I didn't go into the movie expecting a play by play of history. If you're very knit picky about facts this movie will annoy you. If you're a devout christian this movie will enrage. If you just want to have a good experience (maybe cry at the end) this movie is for you. Go into watching it the same as you would most movies, don't believe any of it as fact, but understand what it is trying to point out. Like, the early Christians may not be to blame for the destruction of the library, but the director is probably trying to say \\"hey people watching, faith is the enemy of knowledge\\".<br />If you want a history lesson go read a history book!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just got a Kindel Fire and was dissapointed that Pinterest didn't have an app like they do on my iPhone. That was short lived. So very happy to come to my app store and find one has been created. It has worked great so far. I haven't experienced any crashing or slow speed as others have mentioned. Works just like my iPhone app. To select the board you want just tap where the pin and board are listed, it will take you to all of your boards for a choice. Love it!

B0063GORYU|5.0|I am so addicted to this version of solitaire!! I play it on my computer and was THRILLED to see it available on my Kindle Fire!!
0061655554|5.0|I had never even heard of this story and I dont really know anything about finance either. However, like so many of my purchases on this website - Amazon recommended it to me and i took the bait (are they ever wrong??). This book is one of the best thrillers I have ever read - made all the better by the fact that its a true story. You dont need to have any background in finance or even an interest in it - this book is just such a great story. If you think this book isn't for you - trust me it is. Just buy it and thank me later :)
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I'm an avid reader. I read all types of romance (historical, paranormal, erotica). But I've never written a review before. But with all the hoopla with this series, I had to give my opinion.<br /><br />Where to begin?! With book one, I guess - it literally bored me to tears. There was no plot. I had only read about 100 pages when I thought about putting away the book and not finishing the series.  But on the urging of my friend who insisted the 2nd and 3rd book will get better, I finished it. Well, the 2nd book did get better - about couple of shades! The 3rd book, not so much.<br /><br />I just couldn't stand Ana's behavior - always blushing, never looking Christian in the eye - always looking down at her hands! No wonder Christian thought she would make a good submissive!<br /><br />There were also some editing issues like usage of repetative words thoroughout the series. One that was used by Ana often was her 'inner goodess'. Another editing miss were couple of English words that was used by the author (who is British) that are not used in U.S. - like discussion between Ana and Christian (who are Americans) about knickers (panties).<br /><br />Finally, Like another reviewer, I was disgusted by Mrs. Robinson. I cannot understand how could an older woman not only seduce a 15 yr old boy, but to introduce him to BDSM lifestyle as his first sexual experience!!!
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|This movie is really awful.  Don't waste a dime on it.  Lazy story line, and no hint of imagination.  There are plenty of other movies that are better than this one.

B008MEM24S|5.0|My two and four year-old niece and newphew were only marginally interested in this game (still a bit too young) but I've been playing it off-and-on all weekend.  My Words with Friends games have been sadly neglected.  That's probably the highest form of praise I can offer.  The kids liked the alligator game better, but I did not.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|As far as film versions go, \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\"  is THE ONLY ROBIN HOOD!  A very large part of this is due, of course, to the wonderful performance of Errol Flynn as Robin.  With the twinkle and energy resplendent in his portrayal of the mythical nobleman turned outlaw, he gives this character a sparkle consistent with the best retellings of this tale, a sparkle that I think no other actor of his time could have contributed so successfully.<br /><br />Well matched by the beautiful Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian, and ably assisted by Claude Rains as the evil Prince John, Basil Rathbone as the murderous Sir Guy, Alan Hale as the jovial and hulking Little John, Eugene Pallette as the gravel voiced Friar Tuck,  and a host of other venerable supporting players, Errol Flynn in this film reached for and landed perhaps one of his best performances in a long and sometimes checkered acting career.<br /><br />This ambitious 1938 production, one of the first shot in the newly arrived 3-Strip Technicolor process, was masterfully co-directed by top Warner Bros. directors William Keighley and the always solid Michael Curtiz.  The script is fast moving, the themes are adventure and romance, and the period production design is amazingly near flawless.<br /><br />This 2 Disc Special Edition presents a glorious Technicolor print, and the DVD extras are gratifyingly full of wonderfully interesting production tidbits,  on-the-set home movies, a very interesting documentary on the origins of Technicolor narrated by Angela Lansbury, etc.  Within these extras, for example, you will find out that cowboy star Roy Rogers' famous horse Trigger first had his debut in \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" as Maid Marian's steed, and that his given name (before Roy renamed him)  was something like Golden Cloud.<br /><br />In summary, this is a wonderfully complete DVD presentation, and a very worthwhile acquisition for anyone who again wishes to see and feel an on-screen fulfillment of perhaps one of the most colorful and magical dreams of adventure and romance yet filmed.  This, my friends, is truly THE ONLY ROBIN HOOD!

0060873027|5.0|I usually don't review books that have a ton of reviews already, BUT considering this book was getting so much hate I decided to throw in my rating. If you don't like this book you are, of course, entitled to your opinion, but there seems to be a lot of hate going on here for no good reason. People want to believe because Michael Crichton died this should have either never been published or are mad because his name is on it because \\"its not a crichton book\\".<br /><br />I've even read reviews that claim the only thing Crichton had to do with this book is the unfinished intro which is flat out wrong. It's almost like some fan boys are rating it badly on purpose for no reason other than they are mad someone \\"dared to finish it\\".  Crichton had written a third of this book and had detailed outlines and notes set for it. No, he didn't get to finish it but Preston had a pretty good idea of where Cricthon wanted to go with this story. It's a very fun adventure, and anyone who is a fan of crichton should check this out. It felt a lot like Jurassic Park with how some scientists are brought in and in the beginning they aren't sure whats going on. The book did a wonderful job of showing just how scary and dangerous the insect world is. It's basically the sci-fi action adventure version of honey I shrunk the kids. Which may sound dorky, but it's a fun ride.

0756407125|4.0|Five stars for the first half, three for the second. There's so much to love about Rothfuss's writing, not least of which are his delightful first-person narrator and his insane attention to detail. There's all kinds of humor and unconventional adventure here, not to mention incredible worldbuilding. But, that said, this book requires much patience. The University sections are easily my favorite. The plot and the personal conflict is strongest there. The other episodes are all interesting in their own right (although the Felurian bit goes way beyond the bounds of the ridiculous, not to mention good taste, IMO), but they're a lengthy and occasionally tedious departure from the guts of the story. Still, I enjoyed myself all the way through.

0142418471|4.0|I'm not sure why I held off reading Will Grayson, Will Grayson for as long as I did. Something about me rebelled against the story - maybe it was the fact it was written by two authors or maybe the summary didn't jive for me... but after reading titles by both authors (And LOVING them) I decided to take the plunge.<br /><br />Willx2 did not disappoint, people. This book has been reviewed, and then reviewed and chatted about some more, so let me talk to those of you who are on the fence, or just a bit disinterested, as I was.<br /><br />This isn't a mind-blowing story. I didn't get goosebumps at the end, or fall into fits of swooning love like so many reviews I've seen. It didn't change the world for me, or make me throw my arms up and sing hallelujah in my best Tiny voice. All that said, this book entertained me, made me smile, and made me thoroughly appreciate the differences (and similarities) of two of my favorite authors.<br /><br />The story will keep you moving. I began this book as activities for school started and I found myself longing to find a quiet spot and start reading again. It's a quiet sort of addiction, this story. It left behind little tugs that could only be satisfied by reading just one more chapter - just one. But those chapters added up and I ended up finishing off the entire book in an evening, then guiltily looking at it like it was the remains of an entire chocolate cake I'd eaten in one swoop and would be wishing I could enjoy the next day.<br /><br />So Will Grayson, Will Grayson, you are my delicious chocolate cake. You weren't the best chocolate cake I've ever had so I'll run out into the street and sing your praises, but you were pretty darn satisfying and I wish I had more of you to read today.

071267067X|5.0|I read many, many reviews before I chose this deck.  I was concerned about the quality of the graphics and the tint/coloring in the cards.  However, I made my decision primarily on the claim that this particular deck did not have the publishing company's name printed in small letters on the front/back of the cards (which in my opinion is distracting for readings and takes away from the esoteric quality of the tarot cards).  The time I took to select this deck was worth it given that I fell in love and connected with the cards the first time I saw them.  I purchased the deck from Coast Range Books and the service was exceptional (prompt shipping, careful packaging).  This particular deck is the England, 1999 publishing edition.  The graphics/symbols/pictorials on the cards are clear and easily identifiable.  The coloring/tint is subtle, pleasing to the eyes and adds to or retains the old world charm/quality of the cards.  I love them.  The only complain I have is that I wish the cards stock was a little thicker.  I own the \\"The World Spirit Tarot\\" (by the way excellent deck also) and the card stock on this deck is thick and sturdy.  Nonetheless, the stock on the England, 1999 Rider-Waite is not bad at all and should not be a reason not to buy the deck (in my opinion).  The cards are also smooth and shuffle nicely.  Lastly, I have been researching and learning about the tarot for some time now and even though I still consider myself a beginner and own several tarot decks, I came to the conclusion that for the serious tarot reader a general understanding  about Crowley's Thoth deck  and  Rider-Waite's deck is a must.  It seems to me that the other decks I own are defined by the author's personal philosophy and their interpretations of either of these two decks.
B004X60QE2|5.0|Character- this show is all about it. If you ever wished that the SyFy channel would take the best elements of all those wonderfully cheesy movies that they produce, whip them together in a stew, and see what happens, then \\"Eureka\\" is the answer to your prayers. Each character was perfectly cast, headlined by the wonderful Sheriff Carter, who has everything that one could hope for in a leading role (at least on SyFy). He is that goofy, funny, honest, reliable, downright likable guy who embodies all the best parts of the classic \\"SyFy Sheriff\\", while channeling a bit of Bruce Campbell's spirit. Right on!<br /><br />As far as the setting of this show goes, it's hard not to love the town of Eureka, which seems like it was inspired by \\"BioShock\\" and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\"... but with a lot more love and fun. The new scientific mess that Sheriff Carter seems to find himself trying to resolve each week is always enjoyable. The conflicts that arise are a perfect blend between being comfortable/familiar (to other conflicts in the series) and fresh enough to remain interesting and unique. Additionally, the show does a great job of developing a long term plot, by sprinkling clues throughout the episodes over the course of the season.<br /><br />As you can see, this is an \\"Amazon Verified Purchase\\"... on DVD. \\"Are they still making those?\\" I asked myself, when I saw that it was the ONLY purchase option. The Blu-ray format has been around for over seven years now, and I see no reason why manufacturers would expect me to buy an antiquated, vastly inferior format (DVD)... unless if they force me to. Would they ask me to buy it on VHS, if it was cheaper for them to manufacture? For some strange reason, this marvelous show is not available for purchase on Blu-ray. There is a HUGE difference in visual quality between these DVDs and when I watch the show on Netflix, which streams in HD. Needless to say, it looks much, much better in the HD format, and the (presumably low budget) CG effects hold up surprisingly well under such high detail. I sincerely hope that SyFy and its parent company will decide to offer their great shows in as many formats as possible- including Blu-ray. But I enjoy this show so much, it would not be fair to knock its five star rating for the limitations of the DVD format.hold up surprisingly well under such high detail.

B0084IG7KC|3.0|Maybe I'm not the target audience here, being older than a teenager, and not having read the book (books?).  But to be fair, I wouldn't be considered the target audience for the Twilight series as well, and I to some degree did enjoy that series, and am actually looking forward to the final installment later in the year.  Will Kristen Stewart drain Robert Pattison's blood?  Oops, already done that I suppose. . . .<br /><br />What's the difference then between Twilight and Games?  Well, Twilight doesn't take itself too seriously, at least it hasn't since the first film perhaps.  It pokes fun of itself, which probably means that the \\"real\\" Twilight fans may not like it as much, but it's more approachable for the casual fan.  Plus, I always get a laugh out of the whole six-pack-abs thing.  I laughed my head off when Taylor Lautner took off his shirt in the freezing cold on top of Mount Ranier.  (OK.  It probably wasn't Mt. Rainier for the nitpickers out there, but it was close enough by geography.)<br /><br />I made my wife watch \\"Games\\"; she was (smartly) against it from the start.  But she had some great observations.  First of all, \\"No talking during the movie!\\"  (Couldn't help myself.  I just didn't get the first half and had to ask questions, questions to someone who didn't seem to have any answers.)  Second, \\"Why is Woody Harrelson a drunk in the first act and sober in the last couple?\\"  Hmm.  Good call.  Maybe he had an intervention that we didn't see on film?  Well, I have to say, Mr. Harrelson's performance here is downright awful, almost bad enough to make them cancel the games.  But let the games begin anyways!  Stanley Tucci was very good here, but when isn't he?  I'm a fairly big fan of his and I think that he does very nice work.  I thought that Jennifer Lawrence was a wise casting choice, but the male lead (who is he?) was somewhat of a throwaway.<br /><br />Now, onto major issues.  I did not read the book, and I fear that one almost has to read first tohave any idea what's happening in the first act.  What year is it set in?  I'm guessing around 2100, but that is only a guess.  They didn't seem to say.  No one seems to have money for food, but why do they have lots of money for high-speed rail through the mountains?  The questions go on and on for me.  I could list more but I don't want to burn your time, like the 2.5 hours that I did last night.<br /><br />Well, the last act almost redeems the movie.  I did like some of that.  But what I'm looking forward to:  seeing how Ms. Stewart and Mr. Pattinson get along in the afterlife.  Gotta be better than when they were mere mortals.

B003XCVQ3C|2.0|I purchased this product about a year ago.  I took very good care of it, made sure to be very gingerly with it, and never stressed it, or pulled it, or plugged it in sideways.  I was being very careful with it.  Only a few months after purchasing it, the audio on the television it was connected to began to crackle and after a bit it would clear up and things would be fine it seemed.  Then one day, the crackling became much worse, and wouldn't clear up.  I (gently, as always) unplugged the device from my Macbook Pro and plugged it back in.  I tried a couple of other HDMI ports on my television, and did everything I could to troubleshoot the problem to no avail.  Suddenly, the adapter just stopped working.  Out of nowhere, the device just stopped working altogether; no signal whatsoever.  I took it to a store where they had another of the exact same adapter behind the counter for troubleshooting, and the one in the store didn't work at all either.  Again, nothing.  We tried a couple of different televisions, different cables, different computers, and neither of the two adapters worked at all anymore.  At this point I began to think that my mini display port might be faulty, or that an update had wrecked it's compatibility, but NOPE!  I decided to purchase an entirely different brand, for half the price, and THAT brand WORKED BETTER THAN THE MOSHI ADAPTER EVER HAD! It fit snuggly, and had no problems.  Again, the new adapter I bought, FOR HALF THE PRICE, worked better than this Moshi piece of junk.  Don't purchase this overpriced tree ornament.  It doesn't even really fit into the port as well as the half price adapter.

1451608659|5.0|As a massive fan of the sport since the 80s, I have always wondered what happened behind the scenes in the Karolyi camp.  I am incredibly amazed how clear, articulate, brave, and mentally strong Dominique must be to come out to write this.  I have always had my suspicions about the coaching methods in gymnastics and this story makes me sad about the past superstars and those who never made it as I am sure now that they didn't make it because of really poor coaching. Dominique had it even worse by having an abusive father on top of an incredibly demanding sport and coaching environment.  I hope USGA changes things quickly though they have been so screwed up politically for years well before the Karolyi's came on board that I doubt they will.  I am super impressed with Dominique and wish her the very best going forward.  Sounds like she has been able to slay a lot of demons already.

B0080BFWAE|3.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />Aspect Ratio:  1.85:1 (completely fills a widescreen)<br />Length: 1 hour, 37 minutes.<br />Audio:  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br /><br />I was disappointed in the video quality of this Blu-Ray.  It is just not sharp, and has some fine grain in many of the scenes.  It is not as bad as some Blu-Rays I've seen, and I don't see it as a rip-off, but I think they could have, and should have, put more effort in getting a higher quality video presentation of this movie.<br />There have been some Blu-Rays, like the first \\"Total Recall\\" edition, and \\"First Blood\\", that were so bad that I thought I should have been able to get my money back.  I did not feel that way about this Blu-Ray.  Granted, the video quality is not great with this Blu-Ray, but I would still call it good, and not unpleasant to watch.<br /><br />The 5.1 audio was okay, but there just wasn't noticable surround sound. Almost all the sound came from the front and center speakers.  I don't remember hearing any sub-woofer bass.  But, I had no problems with the sound mix - I had no trouble hearing the voices, and didn't think the background music was too loud.  I didn't think they put much effort into the sound, but I thought it was satisfactory.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I  really do love Pinterest, but it used up too much of my app space on my Kindle Fire.  I noticed while in the Pinterest app it started to give me a &quot;app memory space is low&quot; message and then I started to get messages while using other apps.  I uninstalled and the problem immediately stopped.
030758836X|1.0|Ok, my opinion of this book changed (significantly) as I read it. The story line seemed fairly interesting from the start and the character development was actually pretty decent (although \\"character\\" itself is clearly lacking with these characters, but that was the whole point...well done so far author!). There were a few flaws with the first half of the book (without giving anything away...specifically Nick's flashbacks to his wife crawling on the floor make no sense as the story unfolds...when you read it you will know what I mean), but all in all the book kept my attention.<br /><br />About three quarters of the way through I was still intrigued (although there were a couple points that seemed rather unbelievable (the wife's initial plan for herself...seriously???) but I was still willing to cut the author some slack there).<br /><br />Then..........the last fifty or so pages were brutal. BRUTAL!! I plowed through those last few chapters as quickly as possible, not because it was a page turner but because it was so ridiculous I just wanted the pain of reading it to end! What a total disappointment. It completely ruined what was up until the end an entertaining read. The ending was so stupid and unrealistic I cannot with good faith recommend this book to anyone. That being said, if you take this book on vacation with you and only get about 3/4 of the way through it before accidentally leaving it behind in your hotel room, then kudos to you! You did it perfectly!

0307278255|5.0|This book is a group of stories, eight to be exact, about Indian-Americans and their lives.  In the first story \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" Ruma is amazed how her own life has copied her mother's life meaning they both gave up their careers and their lives to follow their husbands to distant cities.  Ruma's father, who is now a widower, and travels all the times comes to visit her and urges her not to give up her law degree to be a stay-at-home mom and then wonders if his daughter is truly happy.  Meanwhile Ruma desperately misses her mother and her mother's understanding of her life.<br /><br />In the second story entitled \\"Hell-Heaven\\" the narrator reflects back on her childhood and realizes how much her own mother sacrificed for her and her father.  It retells the story of her mother's love for a graduate student the family took in.  In the third story \\"Choice of Accommodations\\" a Bengali-American man and his American wife go to the wedding of the husband's first crush.  In it some strange things happen and just when you think it will end badly things change.  The next story \\"Only Goodness\\" is about an older sister and her younger brother and how much responsibility she should assume for the brother being self-destructive and the pain his addictness brings the whole family.<br /><br />Anyway you get the idea about the stories but you can't know how beautifully they are written until you read the book.  Lahiri has such a way with words and for pulling the reader into her text.  It is a beautiful book you will never regret purchasing.

0425263908|3.0|Bared to You was a good book--if you haven't read Fifty Shades of Grey and already become emotionally attached to Christian and Anastasia.  I liked Gideon and Eva, but there has been so little information given about why he is f-ed up.  She tells why she is, but he has nightmares and leaves you wondering what exactly happened to him.  (was it a male raping him or a female dominant?)  Then out of the blue he asks her about a safe word?  Really?  At least in Fifty Shades, we are sure Christian is dangerous, and he flat out shows her the red room and gives her a detailed  what he expects.  Gideon tiptoes around the whole idea without any specifics.  I hope there is more infomation forthcoming in the next book because I finished this one without really caring what happens next. Also, I think long haired men with ponytails (when he works out) went out in the 80s romance novels.  (aka Fabio)  Hopefully Gideon gets a more stylish haircut in the second book.

0470474874|5.0|I am by no means new to Excel (having certifications in Excel), but there are always new things to learn. I purchased the book to tune up my skills in equations, functions, arrays, and pivot tables and have found this book to be excellent. I have learned about functions that I did not even know existed and it is written so that even the beginner in Excel could understand how and why this is being done, yet it is not so basic that those with experience would be turned off by the way it's written. It's an excllent book! I recommend it for anyone who wants to know about Excel or wants to know more.
B005FISBTO|4.0|I had purchased this DVD reading all the negative reviews and spoilers written. The season was much better than anticipated, only few things bothered me as a Dexter fan.<br /><br />Writing could have been better, however they also changed production companies.<br /><br />::spoiler alert:: ( please take a hint from someone that waits till the DVD releases)<br />The biggest issue I had with this release was the fact that at the beginning of every new disk you HAD to watch the Showtime advertisement. Seriously I tried to fast forward, menu buttons, chapter jump, etc. This ad gives away the ending of the season at every disk. If you are going to make us watch something, don't give away the ending.

B0013V3GN8|5.0|Disc 1 documents a piece of American History that should not be missed, regardless of your music preferences. This is probably the only way you can see Elvis just being himself, having fun, entertaining the audience and singing. The only other place I have seen him \\"be himself\\" is in the movie Stay Away Joe. He doesn't play \\"Elvis\\" in this movie, it's just about a guy with less than the best luck in the world. He and his brothers, plus extended family brothers, romp around, roll in the dirt wrassling, laughing, generally acting like rambunctious kids...which they are, just are \\"older\\" kids.<br />That's The Way It Is starts out with short clips of Elvis rehearsing with the band, in the studio, etc., basically some friendly outtakes. The 4-week concert portion of the disc is an amazing documentation of his boyish and happy manner, and his powerful singing voice...the joy comes from his leadership and is reflected by the band members.<br />If you think you know Elvis Presley, you probably only know stuff like Ed Sullivan's TV show censorship, jokes about \\"swivel hips\\" (not an accurate description of what Elvis does), etc., what the mainstream media has dumped on you. Take the chance - see what Elvis Presley could really be like, and what we lost, and why his fans are so emotional about his sad, unnecessary death.

B006MR2ZQC|4.0|I bought this set about a month ago and i think its awesome. It has epic minifigs and a cool trapdoor, moving floor, hammer and batcycle. The roller coaster is a bit short and its joker doors break easy. The string for Robin is also loose but easy to apply and fix. Overall i recommend it. Not a bad deal but worth it.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|I bought this concert because I was a big fan of \\"So\\".  I find Peter Gabriel mesmerizing in this concert and extremely moving especially during the 2nd half when things really get going.  When a musical artist penetrates you and you feel their message, you are completely drawn in.  The African rhythms only add to the power of his music.  Fantastic show.<br /><br />The 16mm film transfer is quite good, better than video would have looked at that time.  It's a little hazy and soft but lower your brightness do get decent blacks and it takes on a more film-like look.<br /><br />Having watched this a few times I can with certainty say that you'll need to lower your brightness on your tv...as low as you can stand it in fact, the different hues become so much more visible with richer saturuation (like film should look).  Also, I find the PCM stereo soundtrack to be better than the surround track.  Bass is better and soundstaging is much better.  Red Rain as an extra is only available in PCM stereo and it has amazing bass.  I imagine the original track was in stereo so no wonder it sounds better.  It may be 18 years later but thank you Peter and Co for a wonderful show.  I'll watch it again and again.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|This is a great movie first of all. There is a huge difference between this version and the dvd. So much clearer and brighter, very nicely redone. If you compare to other blu rays with higher quality recordings, (hd cameras) you'll notice a difference. But like I said very nice digital remastering, and a whole ton better than the dvd quality.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Others have already covered many of the best attributes of this movie and, perhaps, some of its flaws, so I won't be redundant here.<br /><br />I would, however, like to add one more component to the list - I left the movie thinking about the vast capabilities that each human being (you and me) has within him/herself for great goodness or for great evil.  Even Eli, himself, must struggle with this paradox.<br />A couple of G.K. Chesterton quotes, I think, reflect this same take-away from 'The Book of Eli':<br />\\"Man seems to be capable of great virtues but not of small virtues; capable of defying his torturer but not of keeping his temper.\\"<br />\\"When men choose not to believe in God, they do not thereafter believe in nothing, they then become capable of believing in anything.\\"
B007J4T2G8|2.0|at first it's fun reading, then it's the same old stuff.  gets boring or yu know what happens next.  you would really have to go to the gym to stay up with him and your job.. glad she didn't have to do house work ect... get too the real world.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I bought this on a whim having not really had that much exposure to Adele's music...other than than the occasional radio track in my car.  She seemed pretty good but you need to experience her in a venue like this concert to catch the wave and power of Adele.  I have never experienced a singer who could communicate the emotional essence of her music so powerfully.  You feel like you just had the break up of your life!  Her ability to pull you into her world is unmatched because she makes it so easy to see and feel.<br /><br />This is an amazing concert.  There is nothing like it..so simple, so direct, so connected, so easy to \\"get\\".  Watch it and ride the wave.....

B00003CX8N|5.0|A few fast points needed to help you in your decision to buy this movie.<br />It is a true story.<br />It is about a deep relationship that is based entirely on a common love of books and not anything sexual.<br />The entire movie revolves around the interplay of two real people, who only know each other via the trans-Atlantic exchange of letters.<br />It is the movie version of an equally charming book. (I heartily recommend getting both - book and movie)[[ASIN:0140143505 84, Charing Cross Road]]<br />This is a slowly paced character driven movie.<br />Nothing happens.<br />Conclusion: It is slow paced, has no action, no belly laughs - it is only about two decent people, with a common love of books.<br /><br />By now readers, you should have enough information to know if this movie will be for you. For me it is one of a few near perfect, small scale, nothing happens movies.<br /><br />On the American side we have a budding writer Helen Haniff, brilliantly portrayed and with some physical resemblance by Anne Bancroft. She, Ms Haniff, is/was a real person.<br />Helene Hanff (1916-1997) - wrote this book, more than 20 others, script edited many early television scripts and also wrote many, mostly un-produced plays.<br /><br />For about 20 years she maintained a correspondence with British (to his last toe nail) Frank Doel , portrayed by an equally British Anthony Hopkins. Mr. Doel (1908 - 1968) an antiquarian bookseller for Marks & Co in London, England.<br /><br />Both Ms Haniff and Mr. Doel were not just paired as book collector/book dealer. Their love of books was more than a matter of titles. They both cared about editions, bindings and the lore attached to various editions of the often recondite tastes of Ms Haniff. It would always be a challenge to Mr. Doel, to find exactly what Ms Haniff wanted or might like.<br /><br />England would need to ration food stuffs for years after WWII. Once Ms Haniff became aware of this fact she would make it her habit to send packages to the staff of the book store. We might find something condescending about such a gesture, but is was profoundly appreciated.<br /><br />Minor aside Marks and Co was also home to Mr. Leo Marks. Son of the owner, he would become an import code designer/code breaker for the British secret war effort. Later he would write movies, screenplays (he was also an actor), and as I came to know of him, his fascinating very personal autobiography: [[ASIN:068486780X Between Silk and Cyanide: A Codemaker's War, 1941-1945]]<br /><br />Back to this movie<br />Being that 84 Charring Cross Road is a character driven movie, the two leads are wonderful and in total control of their respective performances. Peripheral to the story we also get to know their friends and watch as their respective circles live through the post World War II years.<br />All elements combine to make 84 Charring Cross Road one of life's small pleasures to watch.<br /><br />Again, this movie is not for everyone, but if you read to here, you can expect to be glad to own this movie.kages to the staff of the book store.

B002L5GQGY|5.0|I've seen a lot of concerts, by some of the best bands and musicians in the world. But I was NOT prepared for Joe Bonamassa! He is a virtuoso. His guitar performance is beyond belief. He is a Maestro of Blues and Guitar. Every time I play this album, I want to crawl inside the music. My only wish would be to have, like on some other DVDs, a channel or view of him only for the entire performance. There are times I want to see how he is playing a certain part of a song, but the camera is either on the drums or the keyboardist. The double drums are great - they give a whole different take on the music. I'm not a fan of horns, but on this album they're used skillfully, and not overbearing - and amazingly I like them. It's clear that Joe Bonamassa has put a lot of time and effort into his guitar: skill, talent and training; and even appears to have taken voice lessons to improve his already good vocals. He is an artist who has not taken his talent for granted, and is focused on being the best he can be, and it shows. He is the epitome of the Guitar Maestro. I think this is the best album I've ever heard by anyone, ever. I would recommend this album to any and every person who likes great music. It surpasses everything. Primo!
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I am trying to keep my review as unbiased as I can since I am a fan of the novels.  I would like to start out by saying I did not hate the movie.  In fact, I thought the movie was good, but it could have been better.  It had to be the directing because the storyline and scenes at times were overdone with makeup and outrageous designs and ignored the development of the characters and action.  Also, the movie focuses on the pre-arena storyline for too long; it should have focused more on the arena.  As a side note, the movie left out some important details of the book, but I will not go too much into that because that is being biased.  A novel and its movie should go together but make sense and stand out separate.  However, I will say that the movie failed epically when they tried to visually create the dog scene from the novel.  Those dogs at the end of the movie made me laugh.  Those beast looked ridiculous.  From the movie, I would not be completely sure if they were suppose to be dog-like; I am just making the assumption based on the novel.<br /><br />However, The film did well at bringing the scenery to life.  The costumes and designs were perfect.  The people of the Capitol were as I had imagined them to be.  Plus, the choice of actors/actresses for this movie were excellent choices, except for Josh Hutcherson as Peeta.  Elizabeth Banks made for a great Effie Trinket.  She was probably my favorite character.  I often laughed at her antics and the things that she said, which was a positive for this film.  Overall, I really liked the film, but if I was to give a five star review, it would have been biased because I am a fan of this trilogy.  Therefore, I kept in mind the cons and the pros of the film as an individual, and hence, it gets three stars from me.  Despite the cons, I would still recommend this movie and definitely the novels to anyone.
B00000JCXD|1.0|I like Moby but when I purchased this CD I listened to the songs and could not find one that I liked. It did not cost that much so I did not feel badly for purchasing it. I eventually gave it to someone that liked it. Next time I will listen to the songs on I-tunes to see if I like them.
B000FCK42M|3.0|This book a a ramshackle, hectoring lecture on the failed drug war.  While I agree with most of the author's points, I was looking for a good novel, not an essay with plot points thrown in  - almost at random - to advance the story.  We have a Green Beret, Made Mafia wise guy who works for the CIA and pops up like Obi Wan Kenobi anywhere in the world to move the story along.  If that is not good enough,  turns out that he is a member of Opus Dei.  That's when Winslow lost me.  I give him credit for great writing, (some) well developed character and excellent research.  But, it just became a mush for me.  By the way, our stone cold killer uses a .22 in a firefights to take down armored guys across the room. Really?  I wish a good editor had pushed Winslow to tighten this up.
B007BGU4S4|5.0|The Intouchables is easily one of the best films I have seen this year.  It is a French film with English sub titles.  Phillippe is a weathly Parisian man.  He becomes a quadriplegic from a hand gliding accident.  He is played by François Cluzet.  He hires a young black man named Driss to care for him.  Driss is played by Omar Sy.  Both actors give Oscar worthy performances with their roles.  Driss is a young man who wants nothing more to get his welfare benefits at the beginning of the film. He is reluctant to become the life in care taker for Phillippe doing things like giving him a shower and putting on his clothes.  Driss becomes more comfortable in his care taker role and then a special relationship develops between the two men Phillppe is a man who wants no pity because of his condition.  This is the way every person with a physical disability wants to be treated.  Driss helps Phillippe rediscover a passion for life.  They race around the roads of Paris in a Maserati sports car.  They go hand gliding over the skies of Paris.  Driss also helps Phillippe find love with a female pen pal. I love the music in this film.  This film contains  \\"The Ghetto\\" by George Benson.  This is a groovy tune with excellent guitar playing.  The film also contains two R and B classics from Earth, Wind and Fire \\"September\\" and \\"Boogie Wonderland\\". I grew up listening to these songs and still enjoy them.  The score  This film also features Vivaldi's \\"Spring Allegro\\".  The score by composer Ludovico Einaudi is beautifuly done.  The piano instrumentals entitled \\"Fly\\" and \\"Una Mattina\\" are  simply goregous  pieces of  music. I hope people see this film. It is an uplifting film about the friendship between two men from different backgrounds.

0307352145|4.0|I am about 1/3 of the way through the book, and am enjoying it.  Cain's style is readable, and informal.  She shares findings not only of sociological and psychological studies, but also her own personal experiences and responses as an introvert, and visiting extrovert-encouraging venues like Harvard Business School  and a Tony Robbins seminar.  She examines the historical cultural development of \\"favored\\" personality types and their implications at the time.  Also included are some thoughts and interviews with known introverted top CEO's.  I am beginning to think there is a place for me in this world after all!

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|amazing book!! The characters are amazing, easy to relate to, which is why, i fall in love with the story, each one of his books, every single time! sure, the plot is along the same line, but its interesting reading it and seeing the little twist he made in each book. i couldnt put this book down, i bought it and when i finished, i wanted to reread it again. im not disappointed with the book. i loved it! &#60;3 im definately a fan!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a great ending to an expertly written, and excitingly captivating series. This one is a bit slower than the other two, but no less intriguing. It leaves you feeling complete.

B008602KQI|1.0|The whole premise of the movie is toatal garbage. The only reason i can see that this series is popuar with kids is the author/creator has an iq in the same bracket as children. Very little imagination went into the actual plot, it was all spent on stupid clothes and... and i dont know where the rest of it went. I also didnt believe any of the acting, but thats because they used worthless actors. All around an absolute piece of rubbish.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This review is for the 2012 Blu-ray version.  Anyone clicking on this product is familiar with the beloved movie, so I will skip straight to the technical specs. And techinically speaking, this is the definitive version of JAWS!  Picutre and audio quality are drastic improvements on even the best DVD transfer.  As far as extras, the big draw for JAWS fans is the inclusion of a previously-unreleased and highly entertaining documentary \\"The Shark is Still Working.\\"  Cast aside your old DVD and go for the upgrade - you will not be disappointed.

B004LX0D36|5.0|I didn't read this version. I read it in print many years ago and it's a great book. I think you can get it free, though, so why pay $.99?
0394873742|5.0|I bought this for our son's first birthday, and while at first he was not all that interested in it, after a few months he absolutely loves it.  As a child I remember being enthralled looking at the intricate scenes in Richard Scarry's books, and wanted to find a sturdy version for my young son to enjoy as well.  The extra large size is great, and it is a semi-sturdy board book which prevents pages from being torn by little hands as with normal books.  He likes to set it on the ground and sit on top of it while looking at the pages, or it can easily be stood up and looked at.  I think the book provides a nice contract with books like \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear\\", which he loved when he was younger, but primarily features a single item on each page, making them easier for really young children to focus on.  Conversely, there is so much going on on each page with this book (hence the name busy town) that my son spends lots of time excitedly pointing at each figure that catches his attention. Each page has an individual theme like construction, farming, boating, and an airport.  For older children learning to read a lot of items are also named.  If your child loves trucks and machinery I highly recommend this book.  I only wish they made bust town wall paper so I could put these scenes on the walls of his bedroom!

B000VWOV3O|4.0|For $9, I don't get other bad reviews.  2 classic albums & 3 average including 1 'live' set.  No liner notes per this whole series.  So I don't get the one review about mistakes.  If there have been any bonus tracks issued they are always included in these sets.  Unless you have to have the expensive Japanese editions, these will satisfy most buyers.  $2 per album, these deals won't be around forever.

0811870987|4.0|This photog really has an eye for beauty and perfection. I am an amature bird watcher and I just aboslutely love images of fine and rare birds. This book is probably a culmination of the very best photography in the world, when it comes to birds.
0307744434|4.0|To start, in compliance with FTC guidelines, I must disclose that I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads.<br /><br />So now the review. I thought this was a beautifully written novel.  I am not normally a fan of novels that jump back and forwards in time but somehow this author made the dual time zones work together perfectly.  Not once did I have to re-check what date we were on or got confused by this and when she perfectly merged them together towards the end it happened seamlessly.<br /><br />When I first picked up the book to read, I thought that the subject matter had all been done before - I was thinking The Prestige by Christopher Priest along with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs, both great books in their own right.  Somehow the author gave it a fresh coat of paint.  Yes the base elements have all been done before but the story never felt tired or familiar.<br /><br />I could not put this book down until I reached the last 30 or so pages and only put it down because I did not want it to end for two reasons.  One, I was enjoying it so much I wanted it to go on and on.  Two, I was nervous that the ending would not do the rest of the book justice.<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed in the ending, some ends were rather conveniently tied up, while others were left completely unexplained.  For Example, I am still not sure what the point of the challenge was but perhaps that was the authors point!  The character of Bailey and his resultant responsibilities (a bit cryptic but trying not to insert a spoiler here) happened all a bit too conveniently.<br /><br />Despite these minor criticisms a thoroughly enjoyable and unique read and only one star dropped for some minor nitpicking of mine.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Love this app for its ability to record and alter calf's. I am a cook/ baker/coffee roaster, and improvement in what I do comes from recording ratios for scaling up or down.<br /><br />Formatting can get a little weird on Kindle Fire because sometimes it's difficult to select column width or row height, and setting type Colorado doesn't always work.<br /><br />That said, this is the best Office app I've found for Aneroid. Wouldn't change to any of the others I've tried.

B005JLN9ZI|3.0|If you didn't already know the actor Aubrey Graham, then you definitely found out about the artist Drake when he blew up with his mixtape [[ASIN:B002LVAZO2 So Far Gone]]. I was really impressed with his music, and knew he was really setting himself from his Degrassi crew and burgeoning on to a new franchise. When his album [[ASIN:B003K1ZF2O Thank Me Later]] was released, I bought it the day it came out. I definitely do not bother to do that with a lot of artists, but his was one of them and I was definitely impressed. But I did not rush to buy this album, and I don't regret that. Wasn't super impressed with this album, but there are some good tracks on here, like [[ASIN:B007IXGZS8 The Motto [Explicit]]]
0525425578|4.0|I'm a fifth grade teacher, and this follow-up lacks the intrigue and suspense from the first Theodore Boone novel. It does not focus on the unresolved murder trial, but rather a new crime in Theo's town. It's a solid read for middle schoolers interested in law, and worth reading just to get to the next one in the series.
B00846REIS|5.0|I cannot wait to read the second book in this series!  I liked the characters and I loved the sex scenes.  They were a little more \\"Vanilla\\" than 50 shadess
B008NEMPTO|4.0|Director Timur Bekmambetov is a veteran of exaggerated action and genre-splitting fang flicks, having directed Night Watch (2004), Day Watch (2006) and Wanted (2008).  In addition to some of those he has produced The Darkest Hour (2011), Apollo 18 (2011) and the possible Wanted 2 (????).  He picks weird projects and visually supplements them in unexpected and often impressive (though also often ridiculous) ways.  He's a creative guy and, in general, I'm pleased with his work--including his latest: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.<br /><br />Our story begins by weaving motive.  Young Abraham witnesses the death of his mother at the hand of a vampire.  From that day into adulthood, Abraham (Benjamin Walker in his first major role and looking like a young Liam Neeson) seeks revenge against that vampire, but hates them all.<br /><br />Honest Abe is trained by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who is as un-Yoda-like as it gets complete with rigid rules, a temper and a penchant for exterminating all vampires.  One must wonder why.  Of course, there's a story there, the explanation of which would spoil the movie.  He is backed by his best friend Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie), a freeborn black man who has some unexplained skill for martial arts (in a time when it was generally unknown to the West) and axe-spinning (even though he lacked Sturgess' Jedi tutelage).<br /><br />Abe marries Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), with whom he shares a life veiled from the truth behind his night life and political ambitions.  In fact, this is where knowing some simple history gets fun.  You'll grin as you see political campaigns and war tactics steered by anti-vampire stratagem.<br /><br />Our vampiric antagonist is effectively portrayed by professional villain Rufus Sewell.  As Adam, the 5000-year old maker of all vampires, Sewell is cold and enjoyably hatable.  He leads the Confederate vampires of the South in their invasion of the North in the Civil War.  His personal cadre enjoys the bedazzling company of Vadoma (played by newcomer/model Erin Wasson, who already looked rather vampy before doing this movie).  She plays her simple part well and I hope to see more of her in more challenging roles.<br /><br />The movie ends with a brief present day scene which smacks of Interview with a Vampire's \\"I'm going to give you the choice that I never had.\\"  An endearing nod, but not without a little eye-rolling to accompany my acknowledgement--not that this was the only time in the movie when that happened.<br /><br />THE SETS:  Now, I only noticed this because I always ask myself \\"now how do I feel about the cinematography and set design\\"--but I was largely unimpressed with both (excluding some action sequence work, though).  Had I not been looking for it, I might not have noticed most of the time.  The scenes were still effective and I don't think too many people will wish they got more from this department unless, again like me, they specifically look for it.<br /><br />To be, or not to be, in 3D:  I saw this in 3D, and it wasn't until the second act action scenes that I sensed that this might have been filmed in 3D.  There was just something about the first act's movement, zooming and background that felt a bit untidily modified-from-2D-to-3D.  As it turns out, I saw the HBO making of special and noticed the same stale, artificial focus and contrast during zooming in 2D.  However, once the second act action begins, you see that the action was clearly made (and well made) for 3D.  It's just that the 3D felt like a natural improvement for some scenes, but actually obscured trademark scenes like the one-swing-tree-splitting when compared to HBO's (and the TV trailer's) much crisper 2D presentation.  One scene really didn't fit in 2D or 3D, and that's the \\"stampede fight.\\"  When you see this, everything is so obscured by choppy focus and lazy-hazy blurred CGI that you wonder if they ran out of budget and then realized \\"Hey guys, we still need to do theStampede Fight.\\"<br />My final decision: I'd vote to see this in 3D.<br /><br />THE ACTION:  After witnessing his tree-splitting training and some impressive axe-spinning flair I'm reminded of Ray Parks' work as the headless horseman (Sleepy Hollow) and Darth Maul (The Phantom Menace).  The action starts somewhere in the middle; it's very blood-letty, fast-paced and entertaining, but also filmed very close up such that you see very little.  So I was quite entertained while also wishing it was done differently.  But during this first act of the movie the events, build-up and consequence were more important than the fights themselves.  Whereas in the second act elaborately choreographed and CGI-enhanced scenes spew gore, sever limbs, and add complex acrobatics from a wide angle allowing full realization of intricate marriages between combat choreographers and CGI engineers.  The sets were more open, much as were for many of Neo's fights in the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies, which allowed more freedom in planning grandiose maneuvers with more combatants.  There's even a healthy dash of post-impact slo-mo (a la 300 or The Immortals) as caped bodies and weapons corkscrew through the air about trailing cascades of black blood.  Very well done indeed.  The action shifts gears yet again for the third act (with a more aged Lincoln) and include a Western-style train action sequence and Civil War battle scenes.  There's a good deal of unrealistic skill and precision which hemorrhages absurdity this flick, but I found myself not minding a bit despite some playful Oh-come-ons.<br /><br />THE STORY:  This movie succeeded where many failed in utilizing a multi-story-style 3-act model.  What do I mean?  I mean The Brotherhood of the Wolf model.  Each act of The Brotherhood of the Wolf felt like a different movie--it began with a period piece mystery, shifted to a large-scale action-driven phase, and then finished as a somewhat supernatural revenge flick, any one of which could have been its own stand-alone film.  Movies that try to do too much (like this) often fail.  In Abraham Lincoln we have a plotty origin story, followed by a more typical vampire hunter choreography-driven flick, and ended with an aged Abe and a politico-military historical piece where period mattered and fights took place in less martial arts-friendly venues.  Again, any one of these parts could have been the vampire-gnawed blood and guts of a whole separate movie.<br /><br />While on paper, the concept must sound like it skirts lunacy, this exercise in absurd fantasy-horror-war-history hybridization comes off as a great summer action flick.  You'll be surprised at how seriously you'll take it--as if hypnotized by some True Blood glamour.  So I say see it.  Be glamoured and dazzled.  Enjoy.Stampede Fight.\\"<br />My final decision: I'd vote to see this in 3D.<br /><br />THE ACTION:  After witnessing his tree-splitting training and some impressive axe-spinning flair I'm reminded of Ray Parks' work as the headless horseman (Sleepy Hollow) and Darth Maul (The Phantom Menace).

B008NEMPTO|1.0|I was dragged into the theatere one weekend and was forced to watch this due to Promtheus being packed and let me tell you this film is just plain wierd. As a vampire movie look somewhere else, the Underworld series is your best bet, this film is just a stupid reason to get Vampires into an 1800's setting.<br /><br />Overall: 1.5/5
1401216676|5.0|As a boy, I grew up reading comics and would spend my allowance on primarily two characters  ... Spiderman and Batman.  The appeal to me for Spiderman was that although he somewhat super-powered (\\"somewhat\\" when compared to heroes like Superman), once the costume came off, Spiderman suffered the daily problems we all face.  I liked Batman because he was both an ordinary human doing extraordinary things, and because of his somewhat tortured, living on the edge of right and wrong, persona.<br /><br />\\"Batman: The Killing Joke (the deluxe edition)\\", written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Brian Bolland, is probably the ultimate story about Batman and his arch-nemesis the Joker.  Although nothing will ever make the Joker sympathetic (he's too vicious of a psychopath in his current iteration), this possible explanation of his origins (there are several of course) gives you some insight into how he came to be the way he is.  In many ways, the line that separates Batman from the Joker is a razor-thin one, and this book show hints at just how precarious Batman's grip on his own reality is.<br /><br />I don't give spoilers, so I won't discuss the plot (but it's excellent), or the ending (which is probably my favorite in all of the Batman comics I've read).  The comic book is not long, and it includes an additional Batman story both written and illustrated by Brian Bolland, and some additional sketches by Bolland.  But it is a seminal work if you're a Batman fan, and well worth a read.  Five stars.
0670022411|1.0|The start is promising with well-drawn scenes of Oxford life, but it quickly devolves into a bodice-ripping vampire romance.  I read hundreds of books every year and this is one of the very few I haven't finished.  I don't usually write reviews, but if I can save one other person from this drivel, then it was worth my time.
1451627297|5.0|I am so sad that I have finished this book.  I had several friends that raved over it, and I put off reading it as I have never read a Stephen King novel.  Boy, was i sorry I waited.  I loved, loved this book.  I especially loved the period when Jake traveled back in town, starting with 1958.  I was born in 1956 and loved all the references to the late 50's and early 60's.  Hated to see it end.

B005LAII58|5.0|Movie snobs should run away from this flick because Oscar is never coming calling for this entertaining, explosive, action romp starring the 1980s' who's who of action stars.  Sly Stallone (looking like Barry Bonds' lumpier steroid cousin) is the star of stars in this non-stop thrill ride.  He's joined by Arnold, Bruce, Chuck, Van Damme, Li, and Lundgren from the Hall of Fame, and Jason Statham is on-hand representing the new breed of action heroes.  The story is immaterial, but it's revenge-based, and provides enough excuses for our stars to blow the snot out of numerous bad guys, and take us from point a to point b without too many plot holes.<br /><br />Have I said yet how much fun it was to watch this?  There are so many inside jokes about 1980's action movies that this will actually bear watching two, or maybe even, three times.<br /><br />Yippee-Kai-Yay!  I'll Be Back!

B0070UFMOW|1.0|Basically I don't like any of the Fiio's and I gave them all away.<br /><br />edited review, response to a well voiced comment below:<br /><br />The truth is, I own all these products and use them all at different times. I do believe in \\"Burn-in\\" or a breakin process, that actually makes sense with most equipment. The Fostex took about 200 hours to burn in, whereas normally about a 100 or 125 hours will do. I sincerely believe, and I'm not alone. Half the reason (I was told by a technician) for DBS (Dialectic Bias System -that thing on your pricey cables with a battery) was to eliminate the need for breakin as well as cancel out ambient distortions). I am NO EXPERT. These are my judgements after using these products. I really, really hated all the Fiio's that I used, and I think I used them all. I do have several 5.5's that I use and they sound great (for specific times they are practical, (no amp access).<br /><br />Secondly, I learned a lot, and I mean a LOT about metals during the last two years. I don't believe copper conducts better, just differently, and of course quality is always a factor. I found that Peter Gabriel's Secret World, and older or Live music sung beautifully through the copper. But I listen to mostly digital or newer music like M83, and even Tiesto has a few good ones. The Silver is absolutely phenomenal. It's unreal the difference that came from silver (specifically Audioquest Diamond series. They are the best cables on Earth. AQ also makes Perfect Surface Copper as well. Much cheaper too, the Diamond's are all over a 1000$. The Victoria's, et al, copper's are about a fourth the price. And all so well made. They are doing great things at Audioquest.<br /><br />Third, my home stereo put me back about 80 G's. Yes, thousands. It was about 8 months before it really started to sound amazing.. They told me too, the experts, that it may sound like sh** for a few weeks, and to leave it on for awhile.<br /><br />The best combination of all products I found for portable music (and I have tried everything-except the Colorfly by HiFi, which I'm very curious about -runs on windows -plays full .wav files and has a 1/4 inch jack) - So this is the BEST of the BEST (for my ears anyway): the Algorythm Solo + the \\"Continental\\" Mobile Vacuum Tube amp (the only one of it's kind) and the Fostex newest headphones (2G$?) from Moon-Audio with modified cabling so you can get a 3.5mm jack (it manufactures with a 1/4 termination) and then a regular iPod. **Of course, also using the Audioquest PSS Silver or PCS Copper. A cheaper alternative to AQ: Moon-Audio's Rhodium is in the platinum family, and after about 150 hours, it changed, started to sound warm. So I'm now on the side of Rhodium (nobody knows much about it when you ask the experts). But it's a great cheaper alternative to AQ. and they're cables are made for portable amps, so they're two inches long, etc. LOD's, Aux, USB Sync, and a bunch of reasonable amps. ALOaudio also has some really great amps and portable cables (watch out for Nickel though at ALO, go with the gold terminations), and they carry my favorite little guy, the Pico. Anyone who hears one will know, it's so awesome. Unfortunately the pico does not connect digitally to the iPod (you will need an LOD -Line-Out-Dock, 30-pin to 3.5mm jack)<br /><br />Those were my experiences, perhaps I didn't \\"Burn-in\\" my Fiio's. But in the end, I gave them all away, because they were useless to me.<br /><br />I see an audiologist regularly, my sonic hearing is well above average, I think I know what I'm talking about as a high end consumer.<br />Also, just fyi, for you audiophiles, the best earbuds I found on the market were the Bowers and Wilins at $180. They are so nice, and I have difficulty with all buds, keeping them in my ears.<br /><br />If yoiu visit an audiologist, and get molds of your ears, and send them to JHaudio, they will make custom earbuds that fit perfectly. It's for rockstars and audiophiles.<br /><br />cheers everyone..<br /><br />-----------------<br />The only two certified Apple AMP/DAC's on the market are these: (meaning you can connect via sync cable -fully digital to analog conversion)<br /><br />The  Fostex HP p1 amp/dac (nice because it's all-in-one)<br /><br />The  Algorythm Solo (+ your own favorite amp - my favorite is amp: ALOaudio's \\"Continental\\" vacuum tube, portable amp, the only portable vacuum-tube in the world, and limited. 5hundred, yes unfortunate! Save your money if you want something great that will last).<br /><br />The Pico, my favorite of all amps, would blow your mind with good cans. Only available through ALO audio I think, the separation in particular, the analog conversion, the warmth. Precious.. unfortunately 5hundo. You will need to invest in your ears. Would you buy crappy contacts? (you'll need an LOD cable)..cheaper ones are at Moon-audio..ALO has nice cables, but some of their terminations are Nickel, not good.<br /><br />Moon-audio also has some great reasonable (Rhodium) products, a rare metal in the platinum family. Similar harmonic quality to silver. The experts say copper is best for older, or live music. I think that's true.<br /><br />JHaudio , sensaphonics, BitAmp Headroom, tons more.<br /><br />okay, now: na nanaaa boo booo if you have to buy this junk.

Even if you're not sure if you'll like it, make the small investment and check it out - so far I haven't met anyone who read it and didn't like it.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I really liked this game. And I'd like to play it more than once. But I get a little past halfway through, and I get stuck. It's the mini game where you need to set the hands of the clock. It jusn't doesn't work so you can't go any further. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times, but it always stops at the same place. Disappointing.
0307346609|4.0|World War Z is now one of the go to books for any zombie fan. I love this book, its one of few books that creates a world in your head as real as ours. Every story feels as real as the last. I so hope Max makes a prequel book, but this time from the interviwer point of view. How did he survive the zacks. Welcome Max Brooks you are now a zombie legend.<br /><br />My one and only problem with this book is as a writer you need to know when to stop the story. The book was great but ran on to long at the end.

B007G51UV0|1.0|This mobo has ruined my first build experience. The board posted and Windows 7 installed fine, but all usb ports, 3.0 and 2.0 are running at terrible speeds. Thought it was windows so I upgraded to windows 8, same problem. Went back to 7 and messed around with the drivers same problem. Updated bios, installed ubuntu, reinstalled drivers, same problem. Even my logitech mouse, which connects through a usb wireless dongle is affected. All devices I tested run at normal speeds on other machines.<br /><br />Also wifi go is pretty terrible.<br /><br />So I would not recommend this board to anyone. I will be returning mine through Amazon, as I've heard ASUS customer service is terrible.
B0085A9J18|5.0|A couple years ago, director Gareth Evans and martial artist Iko Uwais released [[ASIN:B004326EV0 Merantau]] - an impressive project that garnered an overall good response but didn't become as popular as I had hoped it would. Subsequently, I figured that while Iko Uwais might yet become a recognized player in the modern action movie scene, it would take a while for him to do so. Imagine my surprise when \\"The Raid\\" - his very next movie - began collecting a load of positive reviews on both on this site and others months before its North American release. Imagine my increased surprise when it began building a reputation as the best action movie of the entire decade. While that idea might be presumptive, \\"The Raid\\" is, without a doubt, a very exciting and deeply satisfying mix of action-thriller and martial arts vehicle, and it's doubtless that at the very least, Iko Uwais is now getting the widespread appreciation he deserves as one of the new top stars.<br /><br />The story: an Indonesian SWAT team sets out to penetrate the notorious high-rise safe house of a vicious drug lord (Ray Sahetapy), to attempt to capture him. When they're spotted on the fifth level, fifteen floors of thugs and killers are unleashed upon them, requiring the eventual survivors to decide whether to pursue the mission or attempt the equally dangerous in trying to flee.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest common complaint I heard regarding \\"Merantau\\" was that it was a derivative of [[ASIN:B0009VBTQY Ong-Bak]], which was somewhat true. Apparently Gareth Evans acted on these qualms and made \\"The Raid\\" a decisively more unique vehicle: the plot might make some automatically think of [[ASIN:B00005BCKB Game of Death]] with a police theme, but it's played much more down-to-earth than that. Viewers who are not hooked by action sequences alone might take pleasure in the movie's surprisingly well-defined atmosphere: Evans shows how apt he is at creating tension and suspense in making the desperation of the policemen palpable, particularly through creative audio work and the undeniably creepy setting. It's a thoroughly violent movie, but the atmosphere consistently takes precedence over the bloodletting: at times, it feels less like an action movie and more of a survival thriller. And though it's sort of hard to tell with a foreign language feature, you get the impression that none of the acting performances here are phoned in: Iko Uwais is still portraying the young rookie, but plays a fair hand at intensity, complemented by his in-movie partner Joe Taslim (set to appear in \\"The Fast and the Furious 6\\").<br /><br />Of course, for the vast majority of viewers, it's going to be the action content which makes or breaks the movie, and personally, I can't imagine how anyone on earth wouldn't recognize this one's action as top-notch quality. The movie's first 38 minutes are comprised almost entirely of gun-related setups, which are exciting in their own right, but the following 63 minutes proceed to raise the bar of super-violent martial arts choreography. I said it in an earlier review and I'll say it again: the same way Tony Jaa brought international appeal to muay thai, Iko Uwais is making pentjak silat famous onscreen. Whereas \\"Merantau\\" focused heavily on the empty-handed aspects of the art, \\"The Raid\\" brings its weapon-related aspects to the forefront, particularly knife-fighting. Jeez, are these fights ever violent: I can't begin to count all of the hapless players who end up getting creatively stabbed, sliced, and split open in the outplay of the lightning-quick choreography. Normally, the fact that there are only four fights would disappoint me, but each of these is so long and creative that I feel satisfied nonetheless. The one-against-many setups of half of the fights helps sell the knifework (realistically, nobody can stand up to a knife assault for very long, so there have to be many opponents at a time for Iko to dice), but the two hand-to-hand oriented ones don't slouch either. Iko's conservative, grounded style is matched by the more kick-filled repertoire of main henchman Yaya Ruhian, making for some incredibly complex and versatile exchanges that undisputedly put the Indonesian film industry on the map as a competitive entity in the action market.<br /><br />Again, I don't think this is the best action movie of the last ten years, but I do believe that not only has Iko Uwais' sophomore vehicle bested his initial film, it's also topped the latest offerings of Scott Adkins, Van Damme, and just about every other performer of the day. Over a span of eight months and more than seventy other film reviews, this is the first five-star rating I'm giving, and it's a well-deserved one. Action fans near and far, buy this.n't slouch either.

0553801473|1.0|To begin with i must confess something. I didn't read this book! Why? Because i stopped reading A feast for crows half way through. I loved the 3 first books which was bloody and fun to read, in book 4 it all became stuck in a quagmire. I've been reading Robot Jordans WOT series (at least to book 10... i think it was) and can tell u book 4 in George Martin (not even going to mention the ridiculous double rr) set off all the internal alarms, i saw the writing on the wall and stopped half way through book 4. Oh, did i repeat myself, not unlike G.M. then i guess.<br /> A friend of mine own a book store and i asked him 4 years ago if he heard more about the release date of A dance with dragons, since G.M. already had finish writing it (yeah, right he had). My friend checked it up and next time we met, 1 month later he told me: Don't bother waiting, I've checked with some publisher in US and they said it won't be out for years yet.<br /><br />When i read all this review i know two things for sure: 1. I did right for stopping at 3.5 book/s, since this series will be going on until G.M. dies (he don't look like a healthy guy to me). 2. He don't care at all for what other people think of his work. He is a vain person and for those of you who don't believe me just take a look at his homepage.<br /><br />Sorry people! That this book contains no plot movements/ developments comes as no shock to me. My best advice would be to read something else, there are lots of other giftet authors out there.<br /><br />For those of you who will stick to the series: don't come and say i didn't warn you;)<br /><br />P.S. Some of you who write reviews here are really good and i enjoy reading them, thank you:D<br /><br />P.P.S. Tolkien by the way manage to write lotr in just 3 volumes. ;)

030758836X|2.0|I have never sat down and wrote a review of a book but felt so jipped after reading this book that it almost seemed like my duty to warn other readers. I was engrossed, 'fast paced page turner,' i thought. I have done nothing all weekend but bury my head in this book and its impossibly unrealistic plot and stereotyped characters. Then it ends. Trying way too hard to be deep and dark. And beyond lackluster. I kept thinking it reminded me of a bad Lifetime movie as I was reading it, albeit still impressed by how well it was written. But now i will never get my weekend back. I do feel creepy and slimy which i suppose it part of the author's intention for her readers. The fact that i'm typing here only further indication that it has gotten under my skin and therefore must be noteworthy. but it isn't. it just isn't. A complete waste. if you have nothing whatsever more important to do for a few days, pick it up. but otherwise i'd completely recommend a pass.
B008602KQI|2.0|Disappointing! The acting was okay, but fairly lifeless, top to bottom. The ending was anticlimactical. The film hinted most of the way through that somehow someway they were going to stick it to the man. This long awaited anticipation turned into a whimper. I didn't buy the berry episode at the end: \\"oh yeah I fight my way all the way through to be there for my sister and when I'm almost there I'm going to kill myself as a display of defiance!\\"<br /><br />The protagonist was the protagonist because the focus was on her; I rooted for her, but never felt endeared to her. I saw her emotion, but I didn't feel her emotion. I felt closer to the Lenny Kravitz and the young black girl's character. The film would have been more dramatic if the adversaries were more real rather than caricatures. Belittling them made it seem like Katniss's fight with them was between good and evil, instead of where it belonged. I suppose, having fellow combatants painted as evil made it okay for them to die. It would have been far more compelling to have all combatants be unwilling victims fighting for survival while struggling with conscience. If the combatant's characters were developed a little bit more to engender empathy for everyone the emotional stakes would have been higher.<br /><br />Too many inconsistencies. For example, \\"I love this girl from my home town, but I will help the others find her to kill her.\\" The others keep him around to help them find her, but they let him live and sleep next to him after they do. Then he helps her and he's in love with her again. Was I the only one watching the movie who said out loud, \\"Cato, why don't you kill the other combatants in their sleep, don't you know they don't \\"need\\" you anymore?\\" Also, the Woody Harrelson character: I don't give a ____, but suddenly I care deeply. Perhaps, he just cared too much and he hid it in booze. Deep!<br /><br />Many things were emphasized as important and were not. The idea of kissing up to potential \\"sponsors\\" was overdone.  The statement by the host and the Woody Harrelson character made it seem like the lack of water, freezing temperatures, and the harshness of the environment was as deadly as the combatants.  Reality: beautiful forest, rivers, and balmy weather. Why play it up if it was not a factor?<br /><br />The interaction between the president (Donald Sutherland: lifeless and boring character) and funny beard was a useless scene and added nothing to the story. Funny beard being made to eat the berries was arbitrary and added nothing. The scene was played like there was a payoff for the movie viewer; there was none: wasted scene. It was needless scenes like this that took film time away from creating the character dynamics that could crescendo to an exciting conclusion. Instead the conclusion was: \\"oh my, I am going to have to reconcile with my boyfriend and let the guy I led on down easy.\\" Oh, the tension. What a stupid ending to the movie.<br /><br />I could go on, but I don't even know you so what's the point. Although, I did have just as much fun writing the review as watching the movie.

B003VKW14Y|5.0|This is the ultimate interpretation as far as our ears and heart are concerned.<br />Everything is there.<br />The sound of an incredibly beautyfull delivering instrument, a cellist who plays from a long experience, completely free in technique and un-acomplished original from heart.<br />Starker; a fenomenon ! Unicum in appearance. The depth comes from  inner sources that are well opened and seem to be able to pass any rationallity or will. Fluid, intense, waving up and down into the emotions and often it sounds as if a complete orchestra is softly moving-in from somewhere far behind the player..<br />We have the interpretations of Wispelwey, YoYo Ma, Rostropovich, Casals (!), Anner Bijlsma, Jacqueline Du Pr&eacute; (our first and the ear-opner!) and other,less known, great interpretors, but here, with Starker we really found our ultimate match.<br />My wife plays the instrument on a good level and every day the Bach Suites pass her cello.<br />Since we have the Starker-interpretations in the house a bit more of 'singing' came into her approach of the suites. This very special deep from within originallity, the straight connection to the Hungarian Soul? What is it that makes Jonathan Starker climb a bit higher into the listener's inner senses and seems to have given him the talent to reach the spot where every gate is openend that might block the spectator from giving over the self completely to the music. Suithing, binding, energising, a dance of pulling-in and let-go just in time to remain free within the spell of concentrated listening, the upcoming smile and sigh..<br />We have kept this CD in the car for a long time..for us the ultimate test.<br />Can't stop listening. The cover is just a kind of Muzak-Print and the name Starker has to be found by the lookingglass here on this CD.. But the content is a treasure. ! Although, maybe the dreamy isle on the cover is of a nice metaphoric symbolism..?? Anyway ; We hope you will enjoy this one as much as we do and may Starker play for ever !er play for ever !

B008Y212PI|5.0|NOTE: The puzzles in \\"Simple Pleasures\\" are - in my opinion - just a bit easier to solve than most of the FlipPix Art series, and would be a good place to start for those unfamiliar with this kind of puzzle.<br /><br />If you've tried any of GabySoft's FlipPix Art series, you probably understand why these puzzles are so popular. The apps contain picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid have to be colored or left blank according to numbers given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. Solving the FlipPix Art puzzles is a marvelously fun way to develop and practice logic skills. These kinds of puzzles are known as nonograms or griddlers, and they're extremely popular, with entire websites devoted to them. Each puzzle consists of an array of tiles, each of which is either filled or empty, Your goal is to determine which tiles are filled and which are empty.<br /><br />In this puzzle type, the numbers measure how many unbroken sets of filled-in tiles there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of \\"2 4 1\\" would mean there are sets of two, four, and one filled tiles, in that order, with at least one blank tile between successive groups.<br /><br />If this isn't clear enough, don't worry, the FlipPix app includes an excellent tutorial to get you started. Puzzles come in three grid sizes:<br /><br />1. 5x5 grid. These are pretty easy, and they're great for beginners. There are up to three hints available, but you probably won't need them.<br /><br />2. 10x10 grid. These are much more challenging, and they're my favorite size. In a few of these, I had to use some of the hints.<br /><br />3. 15x15 grid. Brutally difficult and tedious. I have yet to finish one of these without having to restart the puzzle a few times.<br /><br />For any grid size, you're only allowed two errors. On the third error, you have to restart the puzzle. In the Options menu, you can set the puzzles to ignore errors, but where's the challenge in that?<br /><br />FlipPix is one of those game concepts that would be clunky and awkward on paper, but plays beautifully on a computer or tablet. If you're not familiar with griddlers, give FlipPix a try, and I'm betting you'll be hooked on these puzzles.<br /><br />One tip for beginners: It's just as important to determine which tiles are empty as which tiles are filled. For example, if a row or column is a \\"1 1 1 1,\\" if you know the location of some of the filled tiles, before and after the filled tile will be an empty tile. Finding the empty tiles will help to find more filled tiles, and so on. It's an iterative process. Also, try to solve as much of the puzzle as you can before using the hints. If you use a hint early in the going, the two random tiles that are revealed may not help you very much. If you'll solve as much of the puzzle as you can before using a hint, the revealed tiles are much more likely to help you complete the puzzle.<br /><br />Note: The product description for the app indicates that the download is about half a megabyte. However, after the initial download, another download of about 22 MB is required, so make sure that you have at least that much storage space available.is one of those game concepts that would be clunky and awkward on paper, but plays beautifully on a computer or tablet.

B008TMA1LY|4.0|I love it!!! makes me smile! only think I don't like is that like other care games at times you need real money... but don't let that fool u. it rocks!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read a lot of books per year--some classics of literature and lots of quick-read thrillers/mysteries.  This book doesn't exactly fit into the thriller/mystery category even though it is a mystery and is pretty thrilling.  You really don't know what will happen.  I guessed some of the outcome, but definitely not all of it.  That's always nice.  In addition, the characters are well-developed and the couple around whom the story turns are both just a bit more than \\"quirky.\\"  In other words, it will hold your interest.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very  addictive but getting acorns is too rare or costs money. might be the demise of me playing the game
B008XG1X18|5.0|YIPPEEEEE! !!! Its not perfect but pretty dang close. I have been waiting and this app does not fail.  Now I can carry the black hole of time with me everywhere ;)
B008XBCJ34|1.0|I love this movie and am the proud owner of the Special Extended Blu-Ray Edition.  The difference between the Extended Edition and the regular Theatrical release is about the same as The Lord Of The Rings Extended Editions and the regular editions.<br /><br />The Extended Edition of AVATAR really fills in important parts of the storyline and these parts fit in seamlessly into the film.<br /><br />Bottom line is the Extended Edition of AVATAR and, regular theatrical version are like watching two different films.<br /><br />I am an avid movie watcher and I highly recommend waiting a little longer for the 3D Extended Edition which will follow this 3D version in a few months.  You should know the story by now, they want to get as much money from you as they possibly can.  Truly a shame they still do this after all these years.<br /><br />Oh, the one star is for the regular 3D edition ONLY. I have a 60\\" 3D TV.  So, by reading the above, you know why I am disappointed in this new release of AVATAR.<br /><br />I hope this information helps people make a decision on what to do to save your money and aggravation level.<br /><br />I just wanted to add, I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING THIS VERSION OF AVATAR.
B0088W5HQO|2.0|I've really been enjoying watching this series - definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of SG-1... but don't bother with this episode.  I really have to agree with the other reviewer that this episode felt like the writers were out to lunch.  There wasn't much of a plot or point to it at all.<br /><br />That said, don't let this stop you from watching the rest of the series.  I haven't watched any shows beyond this point yet, but the earlier shows are better than this one and from what I've heard it gets even better from there.
B003N0XDT4|1.0|It worked for about 2 months.  I sent it back to the company and never heard anything again.  Should have flushed the money.  Thanks for nothing.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I love the game, I'm stuck in Brazil with no PS3 so it really helps. I just don't find all that involving.

B003CN5S7C|5.0|This is a good movie. It is one of those movies you need to watch a few times to catch little details that make it even more enjoyable.

034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed reading all three books in the series. It kept my attention and I didn't want to put down the books.  I really liked the story line that went along with the sexual situations. I recommended the book to all of my girl friends.
0345803485|1.0|What I saw in this book was the stolen innocence of a very young girl , Pedophelia . The girl does cart wheels for cripes sake . And the man is married who is raping a young child. This book is about desensitizing adults over the raping of children. Has anybody who has read this book , drawn that same conclusion? This is very scary that so many American women would love this book, after all we hate Sandusky !
0812993292|2.0|I'm still not sure how I managed to finish this horrible book.  The best thing I can say is that the end was somewhat happy.  I'm sure it was supposed to be full of meaning, depth, and hope, but frankly all I felt was annoyance.  Harold undertakes a \\"pilgrimage\\" when he hears an old friend is dying.  Along the way he remembers his depressing life.  Periodically he finds purpose, then despair, then purpose, then despair - over and over.  Others have said the characters he meets, and he himself, are lovable - no, they aren't.  If you like books that are depressing, full of platitudes about the meaning of life (but completely ignore life itself) and range wildly between hope and despair - then this is your cup of tea.  Yes, in the end a \\"mystery\\" about Harold and Maureen's son is revealed - but you will probably figure out what that is a few chapters into the story; and yes, Harold and Maureen find each other again - but by then you have been numbed into not caring why or how.  Well, I was - apparently I'm in the minority when it comes to this book.<br /><br />At one point in the narrative Harold becomes a media sensation, with followers more interested in the media fantasy than the actual purpose of his \\"pilgrimage\\".  I couldn't help but think that the shallowness of the followers was a good image for the entire story.  It delivers what you are looking for, as long as your expectations are low.  I'm glad to be done with this book, and with Harold, Queenie, Maureen and David.  May they all find their peace - far away from my house.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I ordered one of these in February '12.  After two weeks of 4 hours a day it went bad.  Not sure what was wrong, but I was still within the return period for Amazon so I exchanged it for another one.  It has been almost six months with the replacement and no issues.  I use this mostly on my arm band next to my Sansa mp3 player, along with some higher end Yamaha ear buds.  It really makes the music sound a lot better.<br /><br />EDIT: I thought my replacement was going bad after just over a year.  So I ordered another one.  Turns out it was just a bad cable.  I contacted the company, and they required me to fill out a form and send them a copy of my receipt.  Then, after that, they wanted me to pay $5 shipping for a $0.25 cable after I had bought two of their units, and I wouldn't get it for a month (shipping from China).  I am going to pay $7 and get a replacement from Amazon that I'll get in two days.<br /><br />Another thing: make sure you get it from an authorized dealer or you may get a counterfit.  The first one we got was not from an authorized dealer.  The unit seems fine, however.  This latest one from late June '13 was from an authorized dealer.  You can see a list of authorized dealers here: [...]
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This awesome disc is the justification for my recent new 60\\" LED and sound system. This is a must watch with great audio and a current large TV. Amazing. If you have never seen Phantom, or are a Phantom nut-this DVD will be  a thrilling 2 1/2 hrs. There was no marketing for this thing. Accidently discovered it. Glad I did...You are right there in stage with this amazing company. Fun to see true talent. Enjoy.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is actually a true story in the Japanese culture. They've used poetic license on some details, but it's relatively accurate. This is a great family film.
B004GYY714|5.0|The app is great when you are on the road and you want to check on what is happening at home.  Just tune to your local stations and catch up.  Also fun to hear what other stations are playing across the nation.  Finally, you can feel more in touch with those who live in other regions as you can listen to the stations they listen to.
B004I744AS|5.0|The dictionary is easy to use. The app layout is terrific. It makes a lot of info instantly accessible. I have not had any problems with app. It just works as advertised.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I use their protection for my desktop computer and now use this for my kindle. Haven't had any problems, I think if you used this with a phone you would get more use out of it. With the kindle you can 't utilize all the features.
B005FISBTO|3.0|DON'T WATCH THE COMMERCIAL AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH  DVD, it will show you a clip of the ending. As someone who doesn't have Showtime and eagerly awaits the DVD releases, I make a lot of effort to not to read anything about the show so that I won't be spoiled by the time it comes out. It is very frustrating to be spoiled by the disc itself before I even get to watch the first episode. Considering that this is a commercial that offers incentives to subscribe to Showtime, they are acknowledging the fact that they know that some people will be watching this for the first time. There are so many other clips that they could have used instead. I find this to be pretty baffling. Unfortunately,as with other Showtime releases, the disc will not let you skip past the commercial, but don't watch it if you don't want to be spoiled. I still love they show, but I am marking this release down for this reason alone.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read the whole trilogy and I loved it!! The author did an amazing job. I can't wait for more of Christian Grey!!!
1400052181|3.0|I deleted my last entry to revise it, after completing the book. For lack of a better word, this story is bizarre. You will learn things about the Lack's family that will have you shaking your head, yet feeling very badly for them and learn things about the practice of medicine and science that will frankly scare the heck out of you. It is such a twisted tale of one women's unfortunate suffering and what science did (and did not), do for her and her family. I will have my AP Biology students read selected chapters out of the book since we do speak about HeLa cells and cancer and they should know who she was and how she influenced the path of scientific research.
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game; a fun way to kill time when you've been reading and need a break.  One complaint: the games that try to get you to pay real cash for in game items like coins are annoying...still a fun game though!!
B007NESBK2|5.0|THIS IS A \\"10 STARS\\" BLURAY CONCERT. SADE IS ONE OF A KIND, AMAZING ARTIST. IF YOU WANT TO IMMERSE YOURSELF ON A REAL 4D EXPERIENCE OF ALMOST PERFECT VIDEO/SOUND QUALITY CONCERT, JUST ADD THIS PRODUCTION TO YOUR BLURAY COLLECTION. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It is definitely my favorite of the trilogy and to anyone that hasn't read it I would strongly suggest that you do, it is brilliant!
B008602KQI|3.0|I should admit that it is a good movie, but I like the book more!<br />The book obviously has more amazing details about each character.<br />The movie is not a bad movie, but<br />In compare to the main story in the book, the movie just is a terrible version of it!
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I saw the movie first then decided to read the book. I could not put this book down once I started and it really filled in the gaps from the movie. Suzanne Collins is a fantastic writer! It only took me an hour to realise I had to get the second and third book and I finished them all in a week. I would highly recommend The Hunger Games but make sure you have a clear schedule as once you start you won't be able to stop!
0783233477|4.0|One of my favorite parts of this movie is the scene where Brad Pitt's dummy goes flying through the air like a ragdoll on strings and parts of it are going in different directions from the other parts...they must have run out of money somewhere. They should have borrowed a \\"reactions of the crowd\\" scene from \\"An Affair to Remember\\" and skipped showing the actual wreck.<br /><br />Yes, some of the dialogue could have been tightened up, and some scenes cut altogether, and I think they gave my girl Marcia Gay Harden short shrift.  She deserved better than that.<br /><br />But overall, I thought the movie sets and the actors were gorgeous. I loved watching Claire Forlani and Brad Pitt together, and I loved the sets and decorations. I liked hearing Brad Pitt do an island accent, too.<br /><br />This was a nice way to waste three hours. I'd watch it again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is one of the best works of fiction of recent times. I would recommend it to anyone, especially anyone who calls themselves a fan of science fiction.<br /><br />Concept: 5/5. The idea of humans living underground to survive an end of the world scenario is not new (I immediately thought of the Fallout video games), but the idea behind the cleaning concept here is definitely one I have not seen before. I love how it delves into the psychology of the cleanings, why they do it, and how people deal emotionally with the cleaning. The scenario of the cleaning drives the plot and it is well justified and explained. I had no problem accepting what happened.<br /><br />Plot: 4.5/5. After the initial concept, which is wrapped up in wool 1, wool 2-5 link together a very strong plot. I found wool 2 a little weak on the plot side as not much happened and there was little character continuity carrying on from wool 2 to wool 3-5 (except Juliette who they meet at the end of wool 2). That said the characters in wool 2 were great. I would treat wool 1 as an extended prologue to wool 2-5, and perhaps wool 2 could have been better connected to the main plot in wool 3-5. There were lots of twists throughout the series, and with the exception of wool 2 I did not see them coming, which made them very satisfying. Overall, I found the plot the strongest once the main character Juliette became the main focus, i.e. wool 3-5.<br /><br />Character Decisions: 5/5. Often unbelievable character decisions let books down for me, not with Wool. As with the concept justifying the plot, I never felt like the actions of the characters were \\"out of character\\". The actions of the characters were always believable. What the characters did was well explained and justified.<br /><br />Pacing: 4.5/5. I found the pacing on wool 2 a little slow, and wool 1 was set up as a short, so it is hard to gather much momentum in it (Wool 1 was all about the twist really). Wool 3-5 was fantastic however, and I flicked through the pages very quickly!<br /><br />Voice: 5/5. I would give this more than five stars if I could. All on the primary characters in this book had very strong, distinct voices and thoughts throughout the entire omnibus. It was easy to get emotionally connected with these characters as they usually felt distinct and complex, with more than just one side to them.<br /><br />Prose: 5/5. The quality of prose in this book is fantastic, as good as any book published by a traditional publisher (recently I reviewed The Name of the Wind, which has great prose, I would put this on par with that book).<br /><br />Typos/Bad Grammar: 5/5. Non-existent (that I could find). Wool does the self-publishing world proud.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading Wool and I am very much looking forward to future works from the Author.through the pages very quickly!<br /><br />Voice: 5/5.

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|It's never easy to take a book that is written in the first person and takes place mostly in the main character's head and portray that on film. Add in the fact that this particular story has major high action elements and an even bigger overarching theme, and I think the director and actors did a great job of bringing this amazing book to life.<br /><br />I will admit, I was nervous! Having read the book a few more times that I would like to admit, I had an emotional imvestment in the characters and was very interested in how the social elements would be played out. Considering that this is the first of four movies, I feel the director and cast did a great job! The film was exciting and entertaining. It starts the thinking process and knowing the other books very well, I can somewhat see what direction they are taking and am looking forward to see what comes next.<br /><br />I know that some people are miffed that certain items or scenes from the book were leftout. I was at first upset about one scene toward the end. But then I remembered that like JK Rowling had with the Harry Potter series, Suzanne Collins had serious input in the screenplay. Also, like JK Rowling, some tough decisions had to be made to make a movie from a book. Some things get cut or changed a little because while both mediums tell a story, they are two very different artistic mediums and it is never easy to translate a book into a movie. I also know it has to be very hard to balance making a film of a book that has such a huge, strong fan base along with making a movie that is enjoyable even for people who didn't read the book. I can't speak for everyone, but my family and friends were split down the middle on those who read the book before seeing the movie and those who just saw the movie. All were entertained and could follow the story.  Only one person, my husband, needed a scene explained to him and once I told him that it really was a scene to help arch into the next movie he said 'makes sense' and agreed that it was a great way to open the beginning of this story.<br /><br />Thank you for offering this on instant streaming. This was my first time trying it, despite being a long time Amazon shopper, but it won't be the last.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I bought this four-book bundle a month ago and I could not be happier with my purchase.  It comes to you in one big book with a main table of contents and then a separate one for each chapter.  If you're apprehensive about how to navigate through each book, don't be anymore.  It was one of my earlier misgivings but after buying it and seeing how well organized it was, it didn't bother me at all.<br /><br />As for the books themselves, in the month that I've had them,  I've finished the first three and I'm halfway through with the fourth.  These books are addictive.  The character POV writing attaches you to these people and you really do start to find yourself with a deep affection for some -- where you're worried about them -- and a deep hatred for others -- where you find yourself hoping they'll die any minute.<br /><br />I would go into more detail about each book individually, but that's tedious to read.  I will, however, tell you that every book is more surprising than the one before it and you'll find yourself having a hard time putting them down.<br /><br />For fans of the show -- there are some notable differences.  I tend to prefer the books to the show, but it's because you have more of an opportunity to get to know and understand each character.  The show is great, but many of the actors haven't read the books because they don't care to know what's eventually going to happen to them and they're concerned that it'll change their portrayals.
B001TH16DS|3.0|I'll start with the good issues first.<br /><br />1)  The enhanced version is fantastic, extremely clear and sharp.<br />  You should try viewing the original visual effects version then go to the enhanced version, it's fantastic.<br />2)  The additional information is very interesting. They have gone to allot of work to clean up and add highlights to the sceans.<br /><br />Now for what's not good.<br /><br />1) The episodes are not shown in the original air date sequence. Example The Man Trap which is the first episode on disk #1 was originally episode #6 when aired.<br />2)  I have had problems with disk #1 & #2 locking up while playing. It plays fine then just freezes up and you have to eject the disk and reinsert it and go through all of the disclaimers and the copy right laws, main menu screen then advance to the area where it locked up and hope it will play through the spot that it locked up on,<br />3) The episode Mudd's Women  will not play past a the spot where the women go down to the planet no matter how many times that I reinstall it.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the couple of problems listed above, this would be a fantastic series.
B0018STVHQ|1.0|Everyone has said it before but: the acting is no better than what used to be called \\"TV movies of the week\\", the plot is incoherent if you have little idea about what is supposed to be going on and deeply insulting if you do know the history, the cinematography varies from green-gray to gray-green and...I could go on but I won't.

I've been using it all evening, and other than it being a little slow, it's working great. I was able to log right in and get to pinning. I was also able to easily access my pins and boards. One question: Is there a way to pin things from websites or are we strictly limited to repinning within the Pinterest app?

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked up this collection and was immediately enthralled by the world Howey has created. This definitely is a modern science fiction classic. I urge everyone to read this and share it with their friends. I cannot wait to read the 6th part right now! Highly recommend this. Wonderful writing, wonderful characters. I wish we knew a little more back story of how the Silos were made but thats because I just want to know everything !

B008ETOSYI|2.0|If you enjoyed the Notebook, you'll enjoy this one. Just don't expect much of a different storyline. Imagery was good, beautiful setting, actors were easy on the eyes... but it lacked believability in terms of the main characters' chemistry.
0345803485|4.0|I just read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and thought it was pretty good. Almost uplifting.  As I guy, I found it provided a little insight into how women think.  If this book is any indication, then WOW!  I had no idea.<br /><br />Anyway, I can recommend it as a fast and enjoyable read.  Except for the ending, which was totally out of character and exists solely to get you to buy the next book in the trilogy.  Personally, I prefer a story that is self-contained. Also, being a guy, I prefer guy-oriented erotica. I recently read an e-book entitled \\"On My Face, Please\\" that is just that. An actual story, with believable characters, that takes you on a fun erotic ride from start to finish.<br /><br />I won't read the second \\"Grey\\" book, as much as I enjoyed the first one.  For the same reason, I won't go see the forthcoming \\"Hobbit\\" movie, now that I've heard that they are going to stretch it out into three separate movies.  Everyone has one great story in them, just like for music composers. Mozart could never surpass \\"Marriage of Figaro\\" and Cole Porter could never surpass \\"Night and Day.\\"

B003YL4LYI|5.0|GRRM continues to amaze me.  I've been reading these books since 98, and they continue to blow my mind.  At first it was the shocking story lines, but now George can paint a character in my mind crystal clear.  Perhaps because he started making characters for television, but he describes a character and I am hanging on the edge of my seat. Martin for President!
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie is about the horrors of war and the tragedy of the war and famine in Somalia.  US forces are just one of the military groups there and they are charged with the task of capturing the lieutenants of the self-proclaimed leader of the government of the country who is really no more than a warlord.  US Army Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are sent into the city of Mogadishu to capture the men to gather intelligence and while the action is taking place two Black Hawk Helicopters are shot down by rebels and the entire city goes into war mode to kill all of the Americans they can.<br /><br />The result is an almost day long gruesome battle in which many men were killed or wounded and men sacrificed their lives to save others.  It is a bloody war movie and make sure that you have the stomach for such horrific scenes.  The story is almost true to the historical accounts but the book is closer to the reality of the story, especially the end of the book.  If you like these types of movies then do yourself a favor and also read the book which is outstanding.  The last pages of the book set a different tone for the resolution and release of the captured American pilot.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and I recommend it to you!
0199267170|5.0|Greetings from Australia!<br /> This volume of Shakespeare's Complete Works is a MUST HAVE addition to the home library.<br /><br />The general introduction is excellent, providing a historical background to the culture of the times.<br /><br />A section on the language of Shakespeare is well detailed, covering the usage and conventions of the period.<br /><br />Each play has a good introduction which sets out the work in the context.<br /><br />The quality of the production of the book is excellent.  The font could be slightly larger-[for older eyes} yet the text is quite readable.<br /><br />An Excellent coffee table volume or one to be featured in pride of place on the bookshelf.<br /><br />This volume should be a required reference for all English Teachers.<br /><br />Martin Horrigan<br />Warrnambool, Victoria Australia
630528069X|5.0|This is a nonstop action thriller about a New York cop trying to reunite with his estranged wife.  John McClane (Bruce Willis) arrives in LA to see his wife while she is at the company Christmas party.  John is changing his clothes as he just arrived in LA and the building is attacked by a group of terrorists who are trying to steal over $600 million of bearer bonds.  The building is super high tech and they have specialist to turn off the security systems, communications and break into the vault.  John finds himself alone as all of the other people have been taken hostage and he has to get help and rescue the people including his wife.  The terrorists will stop at nothing to achieve their goal.  They are not really terrorist but professional robbers!<br /><br />The terrorists are armed with machine guns and high explosives including grenades and John is outnumbered and under armed to try to stop them.  All he has is his bravery and guile to outsmart the bad guys......<br /><br />This is a far-fetched but outstanding action movie that I really enjoyed.  It was the start of a series of movies and they were all well done.  Bruce Willis just does a wonderful job playing the role of the professional police officer who can hold his own against the bad guys.  This is a great movie and I loved it and I recommend it to you.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|ive been waiting forever for it to come out yes this game is the best i had it on the i touch but now its bigger
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think this game is awesome. Very easy and entertaining with great graphics and sounds. Every game should be like this.

B000026OHN|5.0|If you are a purist this music was written for clavichord.  The music is divine whether played on the clavichord or the piano. When you have a chance to hear a pianist of Richter's stature play this music and the price is so affordable why harp (verb not the instrument). If you are a pure audiophile, I would not advise you to buy the recording.  If you love keyboard Bach on the piano and you want to understand why Richter is so adored please listen to this recording. Richter takes some of the fugues at a very slow tempo. He has the rare ability to take these moments very slowly and still maintain the forward line of the music. This allows you to enjoy the beauty of the themes  and hear how the voices mesh. In the faster music Richter's well recognized virtuosity is never in question. There are many recordings of this music. This is not a bad place to start. You might  also want to try Schiff or Gould.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game, in my opinion, is just like &quot;Where's my Water?&quot; but with a twist. I was just introduced to the &quot;steam&quot; part of the game, and I love it! I 100% recommend this to anybody!
B007CW2FCA|5.0|Claudio Arrau was not only a great virtuoso but capable of playing with great beauty. The review of jsa is excellent and summarizes the virtues of this set. This set is ideal as a starter set. The recording quality for the 1960's is fine. Do not hesitate. At this price range this set is now my first recommendation.  I am also very fond of The Claude Franke (Music and Arts CD 4640)[[ASIN:B000063DK9 Beethoven: Complete Piano Sonatas]] and Brendel 2nd cycle (Decca Box-4782607). [[ASIN:B0043UOQ26 Beethoven: Complete Piano Sonatas & Concertos]] There are many other sets and individual recordings. We all have our personal favorites.

B007KOMTUI|5.0|I didn't begin watching Mad Men until recently and I could not get enough of this show.  I watched all five seasons within three weeks.  The concept of a show being based in the 60's and about an Ad Agency seemed interesting, but the writing and the cast is unbelievable.  Don Draper is an incredibly sexy man and Peggy is my idol.  This show kept getting better and better each season.  Season 5 was just as incredible as the four seasons before it.  I can't wait for season 6.
B00846REIS|4.0|I will say I understand the critics from other reviewers in regards to the similarity between this and FSOG. Yes, there are many, many similarities, that cannot be denied. However there were three major differences. One, the writing on BTY was quite frankly, 150% better. Two, unlike the heroine in FSOG, this heroine is tough as nails. She is not afraid to hold back and say what's on her mind, she's not shy when it comes to sex, and she too has a very dark past. Three, the relationship between the main characters in this book, as far as I'm concerned, was very different in many ways from FSOG. Overall, I enjoyed this book. The sex scenes were hot & intense. The storyline pulled you in, I was anxiously reading page after page. If you enjoyed FSOG, you'll enjoy this. It's entertaining, fun & sexy as hell, worth the read.

B008M86IXU|3.0|I was a huge fan of Crosby, Stills, and Nash (and sometimes Young) beginning with their 1969 debut album. I attended several concerts and bought everything the guys recorded together and apart up to \\"CSN\\" (1977). Then, for several reasons, CSN's music began to grate on me and I generally stayed away, although I've retained a strong interest in the music of Crosby and his preceding band, the Byrds.<br /><br />CSN has been touring every summer for several years and I've caught a few shows. I attended their concert in Rochester N.Y. in 2009 and was disappointed that half of the tunes were from their aborted covers album. I didn't pay all that scratch to hear covers. They scheduled another appearance in Rochester as part of their 2012 summer tour and I considered attending but opted out when I heard about this DVD package. Why pay $120 for two concert tickets when I could see the same show on DVD for $20?<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this DVD. The guys play most of the big hits with some solo material, a sprinkling of new songs, and a couple of Buffalo Springfield tunes. The 5-piece back-up band (organ, drums, bass, guitar, keyboards) is tight. The venue is great (recorded at The Performing Arts Center, San Luis Obispo, CA, 4/22/12) and the editing and sound are very good. Sixty-seven-year-old Stills, ranked #47 in Rolling Stone's latest 100 Greatest Guitarists list, shows he can still play at a high level but he has lost quite a bit of vocal range. It's also evident, and I'll put this as kindly as I can with all due respect to a great musician, that he struggles with his enunciation as a result of dental work. Several years ago there were even rumors floating around that he had suffered a stroke because of his elocution difficulties but I can remember seeing signs of the problem way back in a 1991 Bob Costas interview. His hearing loss no doubt compounds the issue. However, seventy-one-year-old Crosby and a spry seventy-year-old Nash can still sing up a storm. Their spine-tingling harmonic crescendo at the end of Guinnevere is worth the price of the DVD alone. I'm not a huge fan of Nash's in-your-face social sermonizing, one of the reasons I originally lost interest in the group. Anyone remember his \\"...rules and regulations, who needs them?...\\" from \\"Chicago\\"? I'll bet Nash has made damn sure his accountants took advantage of every rule and regulation over the years. Nash has made a very comfortable living out of criticizing the \\"establishment\\" and then retreating back to his lovely fan-financed mansion in Encino and now, in the exclusive North Shore neighborhood of Kauai, Hawaii. His new song, \\"Almost Gone,\\" which glorifies Bradley Manning, the troubled Army private who passed classified military documents to WikiLeaks, is downright nauseating. Crosby definitely got squeezed out of this concert with the lion's share of the songs written by Stills and Nash. He only has one song in the entire second set. The concert's final encore, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, is an absolute joy to watch and listen to even though we all can sing the song backwards in our sleep.<br /><br />The DVD features a highly edited interview segment in which CSN individually gush over each other. But anyone who has kept pace with CSN knows Crosby and Nash tolerate Stills for business reasons only.<br /><br />Fans of CSN will appreciate this DVD very much. Let's face it, how much more time is left for these guys to be able to perform together? Too bad Crosby, Roger McGuinn, and Chris Hillman couldn't get together for one last go 'round as the Byrds. We're only three years away from that band's 50th anniversary but McGuinn won't be persuaded even then. And why couldn't someone have put together a DVD of one of the 2011 Buffalo Springfield concerts? Neil Young probably put the kibosh on that.<br /><br />Buyer beware: I'm surprised at Amazon's price. I bought this DVD+2CDs at Best Buy for $20+tax.pine-tingling harmonic crescendo at the end of Guinnevere is worth the price of the DVD alone.

B007UW9WOQ|4.0|Director David Gelb set out to make a film about Japanese sushi chefs, plural, but couldn't resist the lure of one particular chef, 85-year-old Jiro Ono, whose ten-seat restaurant in Tokyo's Ginza subway station received three Michelin stars and starts at ¥30,000 ($375) per person for a meal that may last only 15 minutes. Mr. Ono has a work ethic that goes beyond obsessive, and after more than 40 years in the business, he still strives for perfection, believing that there is always room for improvement. Ideas for sushi came to him in his dreams, and he continues to dedicate all of his waking hours to realizing them. Hence the film's title, \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\".<br /><br />We get to see a lot of beautiful, exotic, mouth-watering sushi, to the point that preparing and consuming it seems like a transcendental experience. We see the dedication and impossibly high standards of the talented craftsmen who create these meals. But David Gelb's great accomplishment is to make this all an expression of the personalities involved and of the culture and values that they reflect. Japanese are reticent and stoic by Western standards, and, when we see Jiro Ono through his eldest son Yoshizaku, younger son Takashi, graduate Mizutani, senior apprentice Nakazawa, and food critic Mr. Yamamoto, they convey more than their words say about their own identities.<br /><br />Jiro Ono only buys from vendors who specialize, and son Yoshizaku introduces us to the specialist seafood vendors at the fish market, which is a treat for foodies. Jiro is a real taskmaster, but individuals with his obsessive dedication are often the ones who move the culture forward and set new standards. I think people respect Jiro more than they like him, but he has apparently done great things for sushi. And it's amazing that the filmmakers were able to capture such nuance in the dynamics between these people, working in translation in a very foreign culture. \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" is a great food movie as well as a glimpse at a niche of Japanese culture.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2012): Bonus features include 10 deleted scenes, 4 extended interviews with the seafood and rice vendors, a \\"Sushi Gallery\\" slideshow (2 min), a theatrical trailer (2 min), and an audio commentary by director David Gelb and editor Brandon Driscoll-Luttringer. The commentary is casual but fairly constant. Both men talk about their decisions. Gelb explains how the film evolved from his original plans, how the people interviewed shaped the film. Subtitles are available in English and Spanish. Everyone in the film speaks Japanese; there is no narration.a glimpse at a niche of Japanese culture.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2012): Bonus features include 10 deleted scenes, 4 extended interviews with the seafood and rice vendors, a \\"Sushi Gallery\\" slideshow (2 min), a theatrical trailer (2 min), and an audio commentary by director David Gelb and editor Brandon Driscoll-Luttringer.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game.  I love it!  It's so addicting that I even got boyfriend playing it.  The game doesn't give out acorns often enough since that's how they plan to get money out of you.  Other than that this game is awesome.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thoughly enjoyed this book.  I rarely find a book that I can't put down, but that I don't want to finish because I am enjoying it so much and I don't want it to end.  It was such a mix of humor and pain...An amazing book!
B001IMFHVG|5.0|While the video and audio are not up to contemporary standards, who cares? A 77-year-old grand master of the piano and many composers' works celebrated his talent and theirs in his inimitable fashion. A million thanks to Ideale Audience International for the DVD!
B007SGM084|5.0|It is all a matter of personal preference.  I myself, not a huge fan of reading, could not pull myself away from the books.  I read all 3 of them in less than 4 days and looking forward to reading them again.  (and not because of the erotica, but because of the story itself....kinda get attached to Anastasia and Christian)
B006XF5BTG|5.0|If you're searching for a book that gives you a good strong training plan to help you gain the body you've always wanted, search no further! Michael Matthews pulls out all the stops with this book. He starts the book off by giving background information on how to get fit, how to eat right to stay fit, and then, of course, a structured eating and working out plan. He also references relevant studies and gives you facts to back up his claims to why this method is so successful.<br /><br />I especially liked how he gives you an eating plan for when you want to bulk up and gain more muscle, when you want to cut and lose fat while keeping your muscles and a plan to maintain. He even goes above and beyond by giving a FREE bonus report at the end of the book that you can download online that will outline a full year workout and eating plan to get the body of your dreams. The report also contains Mr. Matthews personal recommendations for meals, supplements and where to start.<br /><br />I definitely recommend buying this book if you're looking to get fit, get muscular and do it the right way, without steroids or crazy, grueling workout routines.

B00866H7SS|5.0|If you enjoyed Fifty Shades Of Grey, you are going to enjoy this book. I was a bit hesitant at the start as my main thought was going to be disappointment after reading the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. But..... I was wrong, I wouldn't say it was better than the others but on the same par. I loved it, and can't wait until the next book is released. The story line is very similar to the other, but it still didn't make me put the book down. I would highly recommend this to anyone out there who was disappointed when they finished Fifty Shades, go ahead and pay the money, you will be soooo glad you did :)

B000SLP4SE|1.0|I gave this movie 1 star not because it wasn't a good movie, but because they had the wrong people playing patriots. The main 2 characters are so left wing and do not care about the constitution. If they did, they would not have voted for obama who at every turn disregards the constitution. It sickens me to watch these two sorry individuals pretend they care about it.
B007QXWV1U|4.0|I am updating this review on June 27, 2014.<br />Today (Friday 6/27/2014) and tomorrow (Saturday 6/28/2014), this is being offered for free.<br />I still think that this is a good app.<br />This is a fun app for having fun with pictures.<br />Let's have a reality check: most people who use this app will only use it to send pictures to others or post them online. You don't need professional pictures for this (You won't notice any difference when viewing on a phone or tablet).<br /><br />I am upgrading my rating to 4 stars from the original 3 stars.<br />When I first got this app, I was disappointed by the requirement of an internet connection.<br />Since that time, there is an increasing number of apps that also require an internet connection. Also, WiFi connections are easier to come by nowadays. This lessens my annoyance with this requirement.<br /><br />Be aware that if you are not using WiFi for your connection, picture quality will be reduced (This is to save data on 3G/4G connections)<br />This is still a fun app><br /><br />My original review is below:<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This app requires an internet connection to work and uploads your pictures to the internet. Pictures are automatically deleted after 24 hours. (To clarify this last item: the online pictures are deleted, not the pictures which you have saved. Saved pictures will be fine.)<br />I wish that this would have been included in the description. I am using a Transformer Prime so this does limit the usefulness for me somewhat (I prefer apps that work off-line). This is the main reason for my rating of only 3 stars (I would have rated this 4 stars if the description mentioned the internet requirement).<br />Pho.toLabPRO is a good app. One reviewer mentioned poor picture quality. The FAQ states that this could be due to his connection type (Highest picture quality is by Wi-Fi, since other services may compress the image). I can't say that I have noticed, since I use this as a fun app.<br />Pho.toLabPRO is a fun app. I like it for the many different frame effects (hundreds) and the magazine covers (10). These effects are the reason that I purchased this app. This app has no adds and does not appear to be intrusive (I ruled out some other apps for this reason).<br />Let's face it, this app is for fun not quality (even though the pictures look good to me). It is a fun app to use and show other people. The many different frames and collage effects could be handy for special photos and scrap booking (I have not printed any of these pictures yet). I can recommend this app for people who want to have fun without being too serious.<br />Just remember that you need an internet connection (preferably Wi-Fi).

B0084IG7KC|2.0|This is such a letdown of a movie. A dreadful plot--haphazard direction--cheap art direction and design and a cast of solid actors overacting. Big movies just can't keep on being this bad.
B006S053K8|5.0|If you were a teen in the 80's like I was you will probably enjoy this movie. It wasn't spot on to the period, I think it is more early 80's then '87 but it doesn't matter, There was a mood to that period of time that this movie catches nicely. Being the last decade of innocence ( I call it that because once the Internet and cell phones went mainstream in the 90's the world totally changed and so did being young) it really catches that lack of media exposure that allowed us to live our lives, to be a product of the area we grew up in and not just one of the stressed out fast paced media driven young adults that we see today. Those times will never return, ever and for us, it hits close to home. It was fun to be young then.....
B008MEM24S|1.0|I would normally a give this game 5 stars, but I just got the latest update and the game freezes on launch. and then only way to get my tablet working again is to soft reset (Power + down vol).<br /><br />when it starts the start up/loading screen, then it slides and gets stuck halfway.<br /><br />I got the ASUS Transformer (TF101) with Android 4.0.3

B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was okay, very addicting, but very hard. I think its okay but can be improved. you'll play it for the first week or so then give it up.
B008S4YZCO|1.0|when you get this game it will take up much space in your storage or the amount you can download.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I read the reviews before I got this and I gotta say the people who did get this app obviously don't know what to do. so people in the future before u get this app and people who got it who already got it u don't have to spend money to get stuff all u gotta do is earn it and if u (whoever u are) are reading this and read the comments below u don't have to turn off ur freakin kindle to get off the game first u go to &quot;STUFF&quot; at the bottom then go to options and press quit that's all u gotta do. GOD!!!!!!!!!!!! sometimes I really wish people took the time to figure crap out then they'll probably get somewhere in life. So right now on August 18th at 12:28 in the morning I peeps am wasting 3 minutes of my life writing this and whoever is reading this.....U WILL LIKE THE FREAKIN GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and for the future if u do decide to get this app don't spend real money that isn't meant to be spent meaning don't spend real cash on a game......all u gotta do is FREAKIN EARN THE MONEY!!!!!!!! well that's all&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; peeps out =3
B004478GNI|5.0|Not the most practical \\"toy\\" for a two year old, but I really enjoyed Legos as child, and I'm a Star Wars fan so what better way to being the bonding experience with my son. He had fun, and no he didn't put any pieces in his mouth. He had fun sorting them by color and I'm sure I enjoyed it more that he did but at least 20 years from now we'll both have something that we both enjoy together, or maybe not, I can dream after all.<br /><br />As for the set, it was cheap and small enough that my wife didn't question what I was doing or why. Since this one I've purchased about five more sets, ranging in size and my wife is on board. Now my daughter (4) loves to do them with me and maybe she'll watch the movies with me.

B007SY3CEW|4.0|This is very basic as a learning aid, but its great for practicing timing and learning finger placement. Because the keyboard moves around, it difficult to know where middle c is and so if you don't know notes by ear, its not a good tool to actually learn the notes. However if you have the songs on another learning aid, which there are some in the appstore, you can use those when you're ready to start playing on your piano at home. I haven't yet purchased the full version yet, but so far this seems to be one of the best games/tools out there like this.

AWESOME..<br />I loved it so much!! I'm IN LOVE with this book...<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster, is about a relationship between Travis Maddox, a good bad guy, who has never had a real relationship before.

They don't seem to belong each other, yet they fell in love, with a wanton love. Very passionate, intense. You could feel it in your bones, in your flesh, this love was hot-blooded. You could be on their shoes and feel the way they did. There was a part of this book, that I literally CRIED I was shocked!! I'm not a crier when it comes with books, but DAMN!! I really felt Abby pain in me.. It was devastating!!<br />The only thing I didn't liked, was Travis's behavior on some parts.. It seemed like he was beyond \\"protecting\\" her. Almost like he was trying to control her life. But Abby knows how to handle him.<br />Anyway, I was only a little bit upset about it, but Travis quickly mature about it.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a real romance, full with drama, real problems, so intense and passionately. This is YOUR book.<br /><br />*I got it from NETGALLEY*
B0045HCJKS|2.0|Somebody running away from something scary in a gimmicky setting with twists and turns; that's Westworld. One-dimensional characters, inane dialogue, cheesy costumes, predictable machine goes berzerk \\"story\\", and generic sets are the essentials that provide the thrills in this over-long movie. Like a majority of scary movies and the stories from which they are derived, the premise is to pile very contrived problems onto the harried protagonist trapped in a \\"Bloodybones is on the first step-Bloodybones is on the second step-Bloodybones is on the third step...\\" dilemma (Michael Crichton and Stephen King are the masters of the genre}. There's nothing new under the sun and there's nothing new in Westworld.
0345803485|2.0|After all of the hype about these books I was extremely disappointed in the writing level and story line.  I realize the book is fiction but seriously none of it seem possible.  A twenty-something year old girl, finds love, a great sex life, a man that adores her, no wait a RICH man that adores and she still isnt happy.  I guess she isn't living in 2012.  I found myself struggling to finish the 1st and 3rd book, like it was a chore.  The 2nd book did have a better storyline.  Next I'll go to the library after the hype so I don't waste my money.

B001QOGYBI|5.0|When we meet Mr. Fox he's in a bind - he and Mrs. Fox get caught in a trap and she tells him she's pregnant and he promises never ever but never again to risk his life taking from farmers.  He'll get a respectable job, as a columnist for the local paper, but two years later (12 in fox years) they have a misfit teen and a visiting cousin and Mr. Fox is feeling middle aged and anxious, and itchy for the danger and criminal excitement of stealing poultry.<br /><br />He's a wild animal at heart, he insists, not made to settle down into age and oblivion.  He comes up with a plan, and along with his friend, the possum plumber, plans one last heist, not just any heist but the big one, stealing from the fiercest farmers around: Boggis, Bunce and Bean (you know: one fat, one short, one lean, but uniformly mean).  They don't take it lying down. Mr. Fox's carefree and careless indiscretions turn into an all out war between the farmers and the animals, and everyone will have to work together and set aside rivalries and resentment and hurt feelings.  The danger is real, and they take unnecessary risks, but they have a lot of fun and adventure along the way.<br /><br />I really dig the quirky and stylish vibe of the irresponsibly fantastic Mr. Fox.  Voiced by George Clooney with flair and a fancy whistle and a click, and animated in a silly and stylish retro stop motion approach.  It's a very fun film, and my wife and I loved it and laughed out loud, a lot, but so did our kids (and so, apparently, did lots of others who couldn't stop busting up or exclaiming around us in the theaters).  The film's got something for everyone, and stays true to the feel of Roald Dahl's classic [[ASIN:0142410349 tale]] while giving it the whimsical feel and quirky delights that can only be found in a Wes Anderson film.  The retro-stylish clothing and settings and the family dynamics, especially that between a larger than life but aloof father and a struggling son (played perfectly by Jason Schwartzmann), fit easily into his oeuvre.  I loved the look of the film, the delightful attention to detail, the colors and lighting were perfect, and the deliberately low tech touches, where you could see the ruffling hair and wobbling of water, just add to the charm.  Great stuff, highly recommended.ann), fit easily into his oeuvre.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|I have already read iCon, which is a book about Steve jobs as well. But this book gives a more insight view from Steve's view point as the writer had the opportunity to let Steve himself tell him the story. I still didn't finished the book but the first half is amazing and very inspiring.<br /><br />I find it very boring the part where the book talks about his family, his sister, daughter and all related stuff. But anyway it gives you a main view where you can see that Steve was also a regular guy, i.e. there's a part where he wants to watch a movie and can't get a movie tape because he didn't have the key of his parents house where he left it.. well, stuff like that.

B000G6R7B8|1.0|I bought this watch on Amazon.  The selling points for me were the classic styling, the low-key looks, and the self-winding movement.  Well, I hate to say it, but this watch has been a complete dud.  It is horrible at keeping accurate time.  For example, it requires a daily reset of the time.  I set it this morning in sync with my iMac (which gets it's sync with the Apple time server, so I know thats accurate).  This was at 10:43 AM.  Now, with my computer showing 11:26, the Seiko watch shows 11:30.  Now, I understand that a mechanical watch will not be as accurate as a quartz watch, but a gain of 4 minutes in less than an hour is ridiculous.  It essentially makes the watch useless.  It seems counter-intuitive that a watch would GAIN time after being wound, but if I wear the watch for a full day, by the end of the day it can be almost an hour AHEAD of the true time.<br /><br />Waste of money.
B007WULJ5G|1.0|I was so excited to see the uncut version as I was under the impression this was a top notch horror film. Well its not!! There is no element of horror at all to this film. Its a descent into sexual deviance of the worst kind. There is some gore but nothing of shock value. The only thing shocking to me is the amount of people that enjoyed this film. There are a few scenes which were done purely to appall the audience but backfired as I dont find (SPOILER!!!) sexual acts with children and infants entertainment...just disgusting and without any type of artistic value. This movie had potential but in an effort to create an intense never before seen work of art they chucked out all vision and just went for pure depravity. Doesn't take creativity to think that up,just lack of! Save your money if you're looking for horror. If you're looking for porn, buy porn and if you're perverse in the worst way, well enjoy!!

0307346617|5.0|I picked this book up at a thrift shop because it looked intriguing and then let it collect dust for several years before offering it to my teenaged bookworm son, who then recommended it to me. How could I refuse reading it? And although I loved Richard Matheson's I Am Legend (the title story and the collection of unrelated strange, scary stories that went along with it), I really didn't know much about zombies. World War Z changed all that. I enjoyed the \\"oral history\\" format as well as learning about the Zombie War from persons from all over the world and walks of life, especially what each oral historian had to say about their experience with zombies and how the Zombie War affected them, their family, friends and fellow countrymen. After reading the book (which wasn't easy, the confusion lies in the changing characters), I followed an acquaintance's recommendation to listen to the audio book and absolutely loved it. The author narrates the story while different actors (including Alan Alda, Rob Reiner and John Turturo) perform the oral historian parts. Every actor's rendition is spot on and the audio experience adds authenticity to the story. I've listened to a lot of audiobooks and of those for adults, World War Z is my new favorite. Although squeamish readers should probably think twice before choosing this title, anyone who can handle the level of profanity and gore one would expect from a story about a Zombie War should give the audio version a listen. Also good: I Am Legend by Richard Matheson, The Stand by Stephen King and Year of Wonders by Geraldine Brooks.

I felt the story line drug out too long then all of a sudden at the end when it started to get good it was over.  there were a lot of good parts but also a lot of slow, boring parts.<br /><br />the video and audio on the blu ray were great especially the audio in the train wreck seen.  if you have a good speaker setup with a sub it is awesome!<br /><br />for 8 bucks i'm not too upset i just expected a better flick...

B005HEW818|5.0|This should be required viewing for any star trek fan who works in healthcare or medical insurance, or really anyone who lives in a backward little country like America that lacks universal healthcare.  The allegorical parallels to profit-driven healthcare systems like ours are hard to miss.  It's not overly intellectual or subtle, but, by setting the story in an alien hospital, it allows us to ponder how stupid and cruel our healthcare system is from a different perspective.  It's entertaining social-commentary sci-fi in the Picard/Next Gen tradition.  Watch it.

B005HEWLQA|2.0|A really poorly-executed good idea.  Star Trek always requires a lot of suspension of disbelief, but this ep had so many holes that it was well nigh unwatchable.  You felt like you had to finish it, though, because you'd already wasted an hour on part one.  Still, skip it--go for a walk or something more worthwhile instead.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|**** Update over 2 years after original review<br /><br />I find that as time goes on I use the G13 more and more.  Yes, it is great for games but I also write profiles for it for a lot of the software I use daily, including generic MS Windows activities.  Used this way, it is an incredible productivity booster and can often completely replace reaching for the mouse.<br />The Logitech Gaming Software has seen a ton of improvements over the past couple of years.  It's easier to use, easier to write profiles for, and looks better than it used to.  It also controls multiple Logitech devices, and is really a programming interface for those devices and not just for gaming.  For example, I use the G700 mouse which has 14 buttons and a wide range of DPI settings.  The Logitech software can automatically switch to the right profiles for the mouse and the G13 for any game or other software profile.  Productivity squared.<br /><br />That said, I don't get the impression there is a big future for these devices.  I don't think Logitech is working on a new model to replace the G13 or even any improvements to the existing hardware.  The same seems to go for competing devices like the Razer tartarus; apparently not enough market for them to keep innovating in the hardware.  I find that sad because like I said above I find new uses for my G13 all the time to make my workday more productive.  I'll probably buy another one just because they probably will eventually go bye-bye, and there's no way you can use a regular keyboard as productively as a regular keyboard plus a G13 sitting on its left side.  After years of use and looking forward to more years of use in so much more than just games, I pushed the review up from 4 to 5 stars.<br /><br />**** Original review:<br /><br />I like to keep keyboards for typing, and use different peripherals for gaming.<br />I use the G13 in FPS and RPG games; it is much more comfortable to have this under my left hand and a mouse under my right hand than to use a gaming keyboard.<br />Also I use a Dvorak keyboard layout, so that pretty much blows using a regular keyboard for gaming anyway (for example, WASD are not exactly in a prime gaming position on a dvorak keyboard).<br />What I usually do is have the game playing on the left monitor, and until I get the hang of a layout for a particular game I have the game's layout displayed in the Logitech gaming software on the right monitor.  That way a quick glance at the other monitor is all I need to learn the layout for a new game.<br /><br />The only reason I took off a point for the review is there needs to be an adjustment for the angle of the joystick.  I like to use the joystick for the WASD movements.  My thumb gets tired after a long gaming session, but if I could position the joystick so the thumb could be lower than the rest of the hand it would be more comfortable.than to use a gaming keyboard.<br />Also I use a Dvorak keyboard layout, so that pretty much blows using a regular keyboard for gaming anyway (for example, WASD are not exactly in a prime gaming position on a dvorak keyboard).<br />What I usually do is have the game playing on the left monitor, and until I get the hang of a layout for a particular game I have the game's layout displayed in the Logitech gaming software on the right monitor.

B004J4WKUQ|2.0|The only thing saving this book from a one star review is that I managed to finish it.<br /><br />I picked this up after being delighted by Wool, another self-published and well-reviewed scifi novel in the kindle store. Unfortunately the two are in completely different leagues.<br /><br />I found the characters of Ready Player One flat and uninteresting. I simply wasn't able to care about the outcome of a large world-of-warcraft game or the recountings of 80s movies that I'd already seen. I wasn't excited when players leveled up or acquired new items. The book felt like a montage of old pop culture and never took a life of its own.<br /><br />I don't even like playing world-of-warcraft, much less reading about it.
B002RI9VIU|5.0|This is a book for those who really want to get an understanding of Spain in the 1930s and 1940s, and the civil war that ravaged the country.<br /><br />It also allows the reader to understand what Orwell and other members of the International Brigade felt when they were in Spain assisting Spaniards trying to prevent the fascists from taking over from the elected government. It contains Orwells book 'Homage to Catalonia' and letters to and from Orwell from his family, friends and colleagues.<br /><br />I found it fascinating and strongly recommend it as a history lesson and great reading.
0984725113|5.0|America's weak economy badly needs more jobs. We all know about massive losses to Asia and Mexico, as well as the estimated 12 million illegals within the U.S. Computers have also eliminated, or at least reduced the capabilities required - witness IBM's Jeopardy-champion Watson, now being 'trained' to help doctors diagnose and treat. Lionbridge's GeoFluent now offers immediate language translation. Blackstone Discovery's software and hardware now allows one lawyer to more accurately and far faster do the work of 500 in the legal discovery process. Online shopping has made Americans comfortable with buying a wide range of products w/o the help of salespeople/clerks - threatening an industry employing nearly 10% of Americans.<br /><br />Now 'Race Against the Machine' tells of a new threat - accelerating technology that is bringing cheaper and more capable robots. Even truck-driving jobs are expected to become vulnerable - 10/2010 Google modified a fleet of Priuses and made them fully autonomous.<br /><br />Common to both the rapid development of computer and robot capabilities is Moore's Law - first reported in a 1965 article noting that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit had been doubling every 12 (now 18) months, and was forecast to continue doing so. Variations of that law have also appeared in storage capacity, display resolutions, and bandwidth. Algorithms are also improving - by 43,000X for standard optimization problems between 1988-2003. Stats-Monkey writes sports stories. Another important phenomenon - digital technologies make it possible to instantly upgrade far-flung processes - eg. pharmacy ordering systems across a 4,000 store network.<br /><br />Ray Kurzweil was the first to point out that constant doubling is deceptive because it is initially unremarkable. However, it's exponential impact becomes quickly apparent. In addition, their value is further boosted by new uses - eg. Google's adding value to the Internet.<br /><br />This last decade is the first to bring declining inflation-adjusted median incomes since the data were first compiled. Median net worth also declined. Meanwhile, GDP/person continues to grow. Yet, the last decade was the first since the Great Depression that saw no net job creation.<br /><br />The key to winning is not to compete against machines but to compete with them. Unfortunately, both educational and health sectors lag as adopters of information technologies. That is changing - online courses on artificial intelligence at Stanford have attracted at least 58,000 students. Khan Academy offers over 2,600 short educational videos and 144 self-assessment modules for free for K-12 students.<br /><br />Recommends improved education via use of technology, more time spent on education, improving our infrastructure, shortening copyright periods, reducing subsidies to the financial sector (eg. 'too big to fail'), decoupling benefits from jobs, encourage the immigration of those with technical skills.cade is the first to bring declining inflation-adjusted median incomes since the data were first compiled.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed this book because I could sense that the outcome of the Hunger Games was going to be more positive than the first book.  I was distressed by the concept of the Hunger Games so I wanted to read that something good would come out of the whole idea.

0307949486|4.0|I didn't mind the slow pace of the backstory in the beginning of the book, but after a pretty spectacular mystery in the middle, I felt the ending hundred pages or so was less than stellar as it slipped back into the journalist's personal story and seemed to take forever to tie up.

B004ZN9R6G|4.0|The second and final full soundtrack record Obscured By Clouds features somewhat of an extension of the sound established on the previous Meddle, and the tracklisting is split between 4 instrumentals and 6 songs. Tracks that stand out for me are Childhood's End which features some of David Gilmour's best lead guitar as well as vocals. Stay, written by Waters and Richard Wright and sung expertly by Richard with some beautiful piano playing along with some tasteful wah-wah guitar from Gilmour. Waters' Free Four which is driven by acoustic guitar, Nick Mason's drum rhythms and Roger's excellent vocal style, and Wot's... Uh the deal which could possibly be one of Pink Floyd's most touching and beautiful ballads ever written. The Gold Its In The...is also another track of mention if nothing for Gilmour's biting leads that conjunct in the upbeat somewhat heavy rock flavor displayed here.<br /><br />The Instrumentals in the title track, Mudmen and When You're In feature moments of light/shade, intensity, quiet brooding ponderance and a sense of cohesion and confidence while also displaying a more laid back approach of musical natural ease. Absolutely Curtains, the record's closer features a Mapubga tribe chant at its end, which is part of the movie subject matter, arranged nicely by Richard Wright. Its a pleasure to hear Floyd rocking out on numbers like The Gold and Childhood's End as well as listening to pastoral-like tracks such as Burning Bridges and Mudmen and it makes the record somewhat of an overlooked gem in certain ways. As previously stated, I find this record as something of an extension with what was established on the previous Meddle disc, while also being a bit looser and relaxed in some of the simple, yet enjoyable tunes presented. According to Google, it was recorded rather quickly within a time frame of 2 weeks and perhaps this is why the record has a more \\"rawer\\" feel to its general sound. Regardless, this is a must have for serious Floyders, but I recommend this to casual fans also for a different perspective within this innovative British group. 4 stars

B004ZN9NCY|3.0|Ummagumma is, in some respects, the ultimate example of a failed experiment. Now, first off, I've been a Floyd fan since the age of 13(late thirtysomething now) and I recently re-purchased the '11 remaster as I write and am currently on the 3rd part of Gilmour's Narrow Way piece. Even though this a double disc on offer, the most appealing thing about this hodge podge release are the live cuts from early spring of '69 and the performances of Careful With That Axe, Eugene, Astronomy Domine, Saucerful of Secrets and Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun are simply well executed musically and contain a solid basis of cohesion and continuity within this, soon to be, legendary lineup. Like some others have posted, the remaster itself on the live portion doesn't seem to differ from the 94 version unfortunately. The studio side idea is what hurts this record even though I find Gilmour and Waters' contributions to be brilliant in parts(Gilmour's part 3 of Narrow Way and Waters' Grantchester Meadows, most significantly), Wright's Sysyphus and Mason's Grand Vizier's Garden Party can be of interest, but not for loyal repeated listenings. The studio side is a prime example of excessive excess of the day and unfortunately fails as a truly innovative or groundbreaking release for the band. Its a novel idea to offer something which covers both bases, but had they opted to record a studio effort with actual songs, I think Ummagumma would've been an interesting success. As it stands, its still a 3 star effort and will be revered by certain Floyd freaks, nevertheless, just not this freak...
B000001EXR|5.0|Great underrated Kiss album , remaind me the hotter than hell sound , very darked , and more thunder muasically , great Eric drumming , great guitar sound , and very great all Simmons penned songs , Childhood's End , remaind me the Goin Blind song , with a excellent bass guitar structure song , Bruce Kulick made a big guitar work. Ok , Toby Wright put the sound of Carnival of Souls , in the grunge way , but more bands or guitar player of these bands love Kiss or Ace Frehley guitar sound. Like Jerry Cantrell , Dimebag Darrell ,  Mike McCready , Dean DeLeo , John Frusciante , and more. I'm from Italy and are a Kiss fan since '78 , Kiss and also Aerosmith and Nugent and Bon's Scott AC\DC open my rock music way , now i can listen a great band like ,  Vast , Deftones , Tool, Middle Class Rut , Chevelle , NIN , Filter , Cold , Call me no One , AIC , STP , Korn , Silverchair , Karnivool , Three days Grace ...and more others.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Works great on my kindle. Really like that you get don't have to buy the acorns or hearts for the items that require them. You have to be patient enough to wait for them though.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Works fine when using it at the moment. I haven't had any problems with is it since I've downloaded it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow! What a well written book!<br />The banter and exchange between Ana and Christian was so enjoyable, I always had a hard time putting it down.<br />I've not read anything like the trilogy and don't think I ever will!<br />Thanks for the indulgence, Ms. James!
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Winter is coming. War is here. Season 2 of the epic GAME OF THRONES rolls out ten episodes, expands on its cast roster, meets and then surpasses expectations. Somewhere lurking nearby, George R.R. Martin is cackling maniacally as his brain child keeps on getting lauded. I encourage those with a yen for full-on gratification to NOT read the books until the television show has adapted them. Sucks for me that I read the novels years ago and so what happens next is still seared on memory.<br /><br />Seven kingdoms at war, is where we're at. Sundry contentious nobles, nursing dreams of conquest, all playing the game of thrones, with Robb Stark shockingly emerging as a charismatic warlord. We track seven or eight anchor characters, and the wonder of the show is that it retains clarity and manages to keep us absorbed - to one extent or another - with each plot trajectory. I think one of the most eagerly anticipated characters is the sinister fire priestess, Melisandre, or as I like to call her, Miss \\"The night is dark and full of terrors.\\" Carice van Houten portrays her with dangerous and enigmatic charm, and, even in a show packed with accomplished femme fatales, she stands out. And yet she's only one of several new and intriguing female characters introduced in Season 2. My favorite is probably the spunky Ygritte (played by a lively Rose Leslie). She gives Jon Snow's arc a much needed boost. Jon Snow and the Night's Watch, beyond the Wall, sort of needed to get a move on with their narrative. Even Joss Whedon is impressed with George R.R. Martin's strong portrayal of his women characters. Whedon may even be appalled by the frequency with which Martin kills off his characters. Or maybe not.<br /><br />So a sprawling cast sprawls on, too many to mention, really. It's a busy show. Inasmuch as someone in an ensemble cast can dominate attention, Peter Dinklage, fresh off his Emmy win, is that culprit. He takes over from Sean Bean as the series' predominant focus. I think we were all looking forward to Tyrion Lannister's arrival at King's Landing as the newly appointed Hand of the King. We realize that the imp is galaxies more devious than the foolishly direct and honorable Ned Stark. And, yes, Tyrion doesn't waste time carving out his sizable niche, bedeviling his adversaries by dint of clever retorts and wily strategies and a healthy bump of self-preservation and pragmatism. In a pit of vipers, Tyrion finds himself at home and very much enjoying the game. I say, pencil Dinklage in for another Emmy. One of my very favorite interactions are those between Tyrion and his fabulously sarcastic bodyguard Bronn (Jerome Flynn). Not lagging too far behind are those marvelous exchanges between Jon Snow and Ygritte and between the disguised Arya and Lord Tywin.<br /><br />There's only so much room, only an hour per episode, only ten episodes a season. To service new characters and new story arcs, several of the established characters get short shrift. I feel that Daenerys's arc suffers the most. The Khaleesi still wanders the desert, her lips all chapped, her tribespeople slowly dying around her. When she arrives at a fabulous desert metropolis, she finds herself quickly at odds with the unimpressed city council as she tries to gain support for her cause. I'm frankly disappointed in her lack of character progression. I'd venture to say that she even regresses some in Season 2.<br /><br />Cersei recedes into the background for most of Season 2 but makes a roaring comeback in the \\"Blackwater\\" episode. Lena Headey is always sensational when given camera time, exuding brittleness and venom and a sort of twisted maternal tenderness. We get the sense that Cersie has realized to her horror that she'd allowed things to slip away from her control. There's an unforgettable moment between her and her despised brother, Tyrion, - dang, I forget which episode but you'll know the scene - which pretty much encapsulates their relationship. In that moment, a desolate Cersei was in dire need of comfort and you could feel Tyrion wanting to reach out, but...<br /><br />GAME OF THRONES is currently the best show on television, good on HBO for going all in with George R.R. Martin's vision and sparing no expenses. Everything about the series is top notch, everything. The sharp writing, the exceptional cast, the production values, on and on and on. Even the sex and nudity are classily handled and work to propel the narrative. In Season 2, the magical elements ramp up. We glimpse a witch at work and her smoke monster, a faceless man, and revenants. In the backdrop hurtles a meteor, signifying mystical portent. And, as always, there be dragons. In a season comprised of magnificent episodes, the highlight of highlights is the effing brilliant \\"Blackwater.\\" This is the episode to which the showrunners dedicated most of the season's budget. \\"Blackwater\\" features not only some indelible character moments but also the most number of wicked awesome kill scenes.<br /><br />And maybe now we can ease off a bit on Sansa. Turns out, she's not too shabby at playing the game.<br /><br />And that depraved boy king Joffrey... how much do you want to wring his neck? Even Carter Burke from ALIENS says Joffrey is a tool. Dolores Umbridge agrees.te Cersei was in dire need of comfort and you could feel Tyrion wanting to reach out, but...<br /><br />GAME OF THRONES is currently the best show on television, good on HBO for going all in with George R.R.

145162445X|4.0|I waited eight months for this from the library: was it worth it? Krauss handles the physics for poets approach with expected results--I assume if Ian Mc Ewan provides the top-of-title cover blurb and Richard Dawkins the pithy and profound afterward, that Krauss aims at a general audience. It's how we came to know about the Big Bang, to \\"weigh the mass of the visible universe\\" against what we know now as nearly 30% dark matter and 70% dark energy, and how cosmic background radiation proves the expansion of our universe, along what appear to be \\"flat\\" directions for light, rather than a closed or curved model.<br /><br />Featuring early on Fr. Georges Lemaitre--whose theories helped establish the Big Bang, along with Einstein, Paul Dirac, and the familiar Copenhagen crowd who discovered quantum physics provides a broader survey than some other books. Krauss takes on the anthropic principle that we are in the universe we were meant to appreciate, and he accepts the limits of what we can know even as he insists that there's no way other than the Big Bang, the flat universe (at least for now), and verifiable particle physics to document the truth.<br /><br />Despite his subtitle \\"Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing,\\" rather than ask \\"why\\" as that implies a purpose, we need to accept \\"how\\" we and all came into being. Nothingness itself, as Aristotle and Aquinas could not realize, contains potential for power, for energy, for creation. As with snowflakes and rainbows, so with all of energy and matter, seen or unseen, it's not a miracle. Like it or not, this is the universe we're faced with.<br /><br />He presents more thoroughly why the hot and cold spots found in background radiation helped measure the age of the universe to 13.72 billion years, and why the lumps resulted in \\"quantum nothingness\\" (98) full of \\"virtual particles\\" (69) that thanks to inflation inherent in quantum physics--this verifiable to one part in a billion!--created all we see and are. No First Cause needed. Out of random fluctuations, we inhabit the visible universe.<br /><br />This universe, ironically, now exists in a perfect phase for analysis. It's expanded enough to measure, but not enough to lose sight of the other galaxies. Eventually, this will change, and they all will recede, leaving far-future astrophysicists unable to outrun light, and to conjecture that they live--as was thought a century ago by earthlings--in a stable galaxy that spontaneously appeared, surrounded by blackness. In the last forty pages, Krauss' emotion infuses the science movingly.<br /><br />He concludes with a nod to the decay into negative energy of this universe. It will collapse into itself again, he conjectures, inward to a point returning to the \\"quantum haze\\" (180) which birthed us. Understandably, Dawkins reiterates in a short afterword the \\"devastating\\" end to our existential tale.<br /><br />But, Krauss as a popularizer now and then fumbles. A cameo by Steven Pinker with an analogy to a God bound or not by condoning rape and murder appears off-topic, and even there, why not cite Scripture when Yahweh called for such violence against His enemies? This would have tied together the idea Krauss considers of whether or not the laws of nature are bound by themselves.<br /><br />The concept Adam Riess found of a \\"cosmic jerk\\" that accounts for about five billion years ago the shift from matter accelerating to empty space for energy density to accelerate and not decelerate needed elaboration. Krauss slips off into Feynman sums without sufficient guidance for a lay reader, whereas Hawking + Leonard Mlodinow's \\"The Grand Design\\" explained this better. Similarly, Greene's \\"Fabric of the Cosmos\\" delved far more deeply into string theory, understandably. (For a philosophical twist, see Jim Holt's new \\"Why Does the World Exist?\\" These titles reviewed by me July 2012.) Even if Krauss suspects some of M-theory, not even labeling it here appears odd indeed.<br /><br />I expectedmore than an aside to branes, but Brian Clegg's \\"Before the Big Bang,\\" (reviewed Aug. 2009) is excellent on this, and the Big Splat: a conjecture Krauss never mentions. He does discuss multiverses but lacks enthusiasm for this model; I get the impression he finds it a cop-out, lacking (inevitably, perhaps?) the proof of his Big Bang and open universe design. John Gribben's elegant study \\"In Search of the Multiverse\\" is recommended for those needing to know more.<br /><br />The book's compact, far more than, say, Greene, and this may or may not prove as a recommendation depending on how much you want to learn. As a layman, I liked best its attention--and the addition of true feeling--to the end of the universe. Although I would have appreciated a reading list, and some charts or illustrations unevenly elucidated his sometimes recondite arguments, I did learn more about cosmic expansion and our universal fate. For, Krauss ends this short book sadly. If string theory holds, our universe being unstable by nature, it will fade away and blink out as suddenly as it sparked.more than an aside to branes, but Brian Clegg's \\"Before the Big Bang,\\" (reviewed Aug. 2009) is excellent on this, and the Big Splat: a conjecture Krauss never mentions.

B001AQIYJC|5.0|This movie is maybe 16 years old, and this is the first time I have ever seen it.  The premise is classic, from beauty and the beast to the 14 year old and his first crush.  An angel falls to earth for the love of a woman.  This is a very romantic movie.  But beyond its melodrama and poignant photography, lies some of the most amazing queries put to thought.  This movie was great, because it's characters, particularly Nicolas Cage's character asked questions whose novelty we have all long since forgotten at kindergarten.  Yet, like children, experiencing the wonder of life for the first time, this movie gives us an opportunity to rediscover what we'd already discovered, but now in a rich and philosophical way with the added context of life experience.<br /><br />Overall, I liked City of Angels.  Performances were good.  But, I am most impressed with its ability, to remind us of the important things in life, in the same way that children and animals do in their unashamed innocence. . . like messengers of God.
B002OTO38K|5.0|This is a great story, well told, and an excellent film.  Felicity Huffman's performance has been widely and deservedly praised.  Kevin Zegers' performance should also be praised.  As her son, there's pathos and subtlety in his portrayal and the changes he undergoes that are overshadowed by the brillance of hers.  He's also quite good looking.  I hope the fact he isn't typecast and that the film industry picks up on his talent.

030758836X|4.0|I ordered up the sample first and, although i wasn't  one hundred percent convinced, I decided to order it.  I'm happy I did. This book, the first I have read from Gillian Flynn, became a page turner relatively quickly.  I enjoyed the character development - it crept up on me slowly and brought me through the twists and turns in a way that was not as predictable as I had imagined.  The second half was utterly fantastic --- until the ending, which I felt might have been treated differently, but... ok.  That's a style question.  Because of that and because it took a couple of turns of the key to get the book started, I deducted one star.  But make no mistake!  It's a great book, and very worth the read!

B000002U88|5.0|I have had this album before and when it became damaged from poor storage I replaced it through Amazon. I have always liked Bob Seger, his gravely voice and the way many of his songs tell a bitter sweet story of such events as love and redemption. A nice mix of ballad and hard rocking Bob Seger's music has always delivered the goods  during his long career.  Joe Turner
0061122416|3.0|\\"Inspiring\\", \\"moving\\", and \\"magical\\" are definitely not the words I would use to describe The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. In fact, a lot of the story is hokey and altogether falls short of the typical standards that make a good novel (such as in-depth characterization and world-building). However, the book does not take long to read and if you have a few hours to invest in the story to see what everyone is talking about, then there are a few highlights.<br /><br />Coelho tries to reconstruct the fable with The Alchemist, and as far as I'm concerned he hit the mark. There are lot of repetitions, obvious and instructional metaphors, and oversimplified morals. I am not saying that it is a style to read and re-read again, but it is an interesting goal and achievement for the author. After all, the point of the book is that following your dreams is as simple as getting up and going, even when your heart makes it seem hard because it is afraid of failure. I think the simple form of the fable underlines the author's simple purpose of the book.<br /><br />The movement in the book is also noteworthy. Spanning an idyllic countryside of Spain to a colorful but crowded African port town and finally to the beautiful but deadly Sahara Desert, the book encompasses a taste of different cultures and religions. I appreciated especially the change in Santiago's view of other people. He began his journey afraid of the Moors who had invaded Spain in the past, fearful of the Arabs and their strange religion, and resentful at the Englishman's aloof behavior. But as he becomes immersed in his journey he realizes that even while two nations might war and two religions might clash, in the end people are just people. What's more, he realizes that he can learn from all people--from ordinary shop owners to tribal war chiefs. \\"We are all one with the world\\" and some of the other phrases Coelho used are a bit overblown and contrived, but there is something to be said about the majority of life's journey being the people met along the way.<br /><br />\\"Motivational\\" and \\"spiritual\\" The Alchemist is not, in my opinion, although I think Coelho might have intended it to be. However, admirable aspects of the work like literary elements and the cultural scope should not be overlooked.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|This is the second classical mythology film starring Sam Worthington that I have seen and now own. Being a student of classical mythology and Greek culture in general I am somewhat biased towards films of this genre. While the interpretation of Greek mythology is a \\" bit of a stretch \\" I thoroughly enjoyed the action and the stolid but believable chracterization by Sam Worthington. The film does rely heavily on special effects but all in all I enjoyed the story. I hope that there is a another one to follow.  Joe Turner
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked all the twists and turns in the book.  It was a quick, easy read.  One huge problem however was the ending.  I felt like the author did not know how to end the book so she just stopped writing.  The ending was a major disappointment.
0060512806|2.0|This book I must equate with the Engineer Trilogy in that it's wordy without sustenance. I felt this book was a tough read because nothing about the characters was engrossing. I felt like I was reading sparknotes on the characters' lives instead of living their experiences. Nothing ever really got me excited in this book. Very disappointed in this read.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Do you know what this is? This is PAIN. Mental and Physical PAIN. Pain in the worst possible way. This is nothing but pretentious avant-garde garbage.<br /><br />This could have been such a wonderful album if Metallica and Lou Reed moved away from the expressionist approach. But no, the music is repetitive, the lyrics are bizarre, and the vocals are pathetic. The music is beyond bad because it lacks melody and consistency. The lyrics are strange, though admittedly, most of it isn't terrible if seen correctly as an expressionist poem. James Hetfield's performance is okay, but Reed's is almost apocalyptic. All he does is say the text with an almost monotonous tone. His voice is very uninteresting to listen to. But the worst thing about Lulu is that it's downright tedious. The repetitive musical notes and strange lyrics gives an authentic sense of boredom. Falling asleep halfway through the album is almost a necessity.<br /><br />Hetfield, Hammett, Trujillo, and Ulrich are the only redeeming values in Lulu. Everything else is just terrible. The band's collaboration with Lou Reed was a big mistake from the very beginning. I don't hate Reed, but his concept didn't fit in Metallica's universe. This album can only be a reminder that some collaborations can be a disaster if not done wisely and carefully.<br /><br />Grade: 2.2 out of 10<br /><br />Also from Metallica<br />Ride the Lightning (9.8 out of 10) [[ASIN:B000002H2H Ride the Lightning]]<br />Master of Puppets (8 out of 10) [[ASIN:B000002H33 Master of Puppets]]<br />...And Justice for All (9.7 out of 10) [[ASIN:B000002H6C ...And Justice For All]]<br />The Black Album (9.8 out of 10) [[ASIN:B000002H97 Metallica]]<br />Load (9.3 out of 10) [[ASIN:B000002HMH Load]]<br />Re-Load (9.1 out of 10) [[ASIN:B000002HRE Re-Load]]<br />S&M, Live (10 out of 10) [[ASIN:B00002Z88D S&M]]<br />St. Anger (7.5 out of 10) [[ASIN:B00008OWZG St. Anger]]<br />Death Magnetic (9.4 out of 10) [[ASIN:B00192KCQ0 Death Magnetic]]
B002TLSSXO|4.0|I have been looking at these utensils for a while, ever since I bought my first Joseph Joseph product. I just couldn't justify the purchase when I already had these tools in different forms. Now I wish I had bought them sooner.<br /><br />I use the slim spatula every morning when I make eggs. I love the slotted spoon for making pasta, the ladle is great for soups and stews, the pasta spoon, larger spatula and non-slotted spoon are wonderful. These fit nicely in my utensil holder, and I love that they are weighted. I can set them down at any time and not worry that I am getting pancake batter on the counter and that I am not soiling my spoon with anything that might be on the stove.<br /><br />They feel good in my hand and even after lots and lots of use, the colors are bright and the surfaces aren't scratched or burnt.<br /><br />My one single complaint is that in the smaller spatula, water seems to gather inside it when in the dishwasher. If I forget to drain it, I'll get dishwasher water in the thing I am cooking when I use it. And that kind of sucks, you know? But it wasn't enough to not keep the set and doesn't outweigh the pros.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is an amazing knife!  It is hefty and can for sure take a beating.  I added the micarta grips and while the stock handle feels great, the micartas make the knife look great and feel even better.  Would definitely recommend this knife as a smaller fixed blade that can be used for just about everything and doesnt take up the space that a BK9 would.  My personal choice would be the BK9 with a Mora Companion as a smaller fixed blade but the BK2 can do just as much as those other two.  Get this knife and put the micarta grips on it.
1439170916|5.0|One of the other reviewers of this book used the word \\"effortless\\" to describe it, and it struck me that that is the most appropriate word for it.  I am in medicine, and I was blown away by the fact that the writing in this book would be as engaging to me as to someone with no background in medicine or biology.  The history of cancer diagnosis and treatment as documented here is both concise and detailed.  I found this book absolutely fascinating.  Anyone with an interest in one of the world's most enduring conditions, from the psychologic/sociologic impact to the biology of the disease itself, would find this work enthralling.
034547581X|5.0|As a huge military bio fan, this book surpassed any expectation I had. First seeing the movie, I was excited, yet had some reservations about reading the real story written by Col. Moore himself; however, reading this book brings forth emotions and an entirely new perspective to what the heroes of the Vietnam war really went through. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the real military aspects of war in true narrative form. It's more than just politics, and this novel illustrates the actions, thoughts, and emotions by the boots-on-the-ground in a way one can only understand by being there.
0345803493|2.0|Oh where do I start? I have seen a lot of reviews about this book with people saying that they thought Fifty Shades Darker was better than Fifty Shades of Grey but I have to completely disagree. I could hardly stand this book. I kept having to put it down after every few chapters because I just couldn't read anymore, it irritated me that much. Overall, it took me about a week to read which is unusual because I easily read entire 500+ page books in two-three days or less. The plot was very weak and lacking, nothing like the first book in the trilogy. Similar things happened in this one and it was just so easy to compare Fifty Shades of Grey.<br /><br />I don't see why every single girl who reads these books 'swoons' over Christian Grey. Honestly, he creeps me out. Anytime Ana forgot to eat or skipped a meal, he would freak out at her. I don't mean 'Oh Ana, you should eat something', I mean full on FLIPPING out. It's not just that that bothers me about him. He is way too overprotective and controlling too. He actually went and bought the company Ana works for just to keep an eye on her. I mean, seriously? And then there's the fact that he has a full file all about her in his office. It gets even creepier. He tells her that he did his research on her and kept the files since the very first day he met her.. THAT'S SO CREEPY. And Ana was furious with him for like two seconds and then suddenly he smiles at her and she forgets immediately? It was so stupid and cringy, I just had to put the book down.<br /><br />Another thing I want to talk about is how unrealistic their relationship is. Okay, so I have said all of the points above about him being a stalker. If that was any sane person, they would be totally freaked out, especially after everything he done to her in the first book, that was enough to make any girl run for the hills but no, Ana, being the simple and desperate girl that she is has to welcome him back with open arms as soon as he comes crawling back. After that, you think she would be cautious in giving him a second chance and take absolutely no bull from him, anyone would, right? Wrong. Ana wouldn't. He basically forces her to eat even when she's not hungry. Strike one. He's over-controlling. Strike two. He wants to bring you into his 'Red Room of Pain' and hit you. Strike three and you're out. I can't even put into words how much I hate Ana. She just gets on my nerves so much.<br /><br />Just everything about them was rushed. Their entire relationship. Since the start of Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker, just five weeks have passed and something huge happens towards the end of this book which is ridiculous. There was no buildup and/or connection of their relationship, just mindless sex most of the time. About half way through this one, that's when they begin to form a bond that has nothing to do with sex. That was probably the only part I really enjoyed.<br /><br />Oh, and the amount of times Ana says or thinks 'My Fifty Shades' (she's talking about Christian) is horrendous. It was so annoying. Every few pages she would say it and I really wanted to just reach in and smack her. Agh, she makes me blood boil. Overall, I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. I would only recommend it if you have read the first book in the trilogy and want to find out what happens next.

While \\"50 Shades\\" tries to mainstream this behavior in the arts/media, the Council for Secular Humanism has been working to mainstream it in academia.  We already have an epidemic of sexual and other forms of child abuse, we don't need a book or a conspiracy to create it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.

B00464CU7M|5.0|I thought this DVD was wonderful.  I live in the USA and am not privileged to attend Katherine's performances in person.  What a talented and creative young woman.  Her performance at the O2 was outstanding.  I was so happy to be able to see it via the DVD.  Thank you Katherine.  Bring us more DVD's as well as your wonderful CD's.  I am a huge fan.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|I read the book in '09 just after Catching Fire was released (about the same time rumors of a movie started stirring around) and loved it. So naturally when the movie eventually came out I had to see it, but I decided to wait for the DVD, and I'm glad I did. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but it could've been so much better. The actors seem to show no chemistry as the characters in the book do nor do they even seem to display the same emotions. The pacing is all off, and the movie in general simply feels too short, resulting in underdeveloped characters and a jumpy story. With three sequels currently planned I really hope they don't make the same mistake again. This is a decent movie if you've enjoyed the book, if you didn't or haven't read it I can't see you enjoying this film.<br /><br />Overall 3/5 Stars, I can recommend this movie if you liked the book, but if you're planning to watch it simply to see what all the hype was about you will most likely be dissappointed.
B00403CLK0|5.0|Katherine is a very talented young woman.  Her performance at the O2 was outstanding.  I live in the USA and was unfamiliar with this wonderful woman's talents.  This DVD is super.  I love it and recommend it to others who enjoy Katherine's talents, but unable to see her \\"live\\".  I could watch this over and over.  Thank you Katherine.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|I wanted to laugh, I love silly pseudo-re-makes and this was exactly what I wanted. It was quite hilarious throughout the movie (though some of the acting seemed a little forced). Channing Tatum (Super wicked disgusting body) and Jonah Hill *giggles* make cute co-stars. In spite of all the \\"one star ratings\\" I hope they make a sequel that isn't some dumb stoner college plot.  p.s: <3 the cameos.
B004O7EVLY|5.0|After hundreds of listens,I had to re-write this review. Still the best hard-n-heavy rock record of 2011! Early 70s sound nailed perfect! Killer guitar,awesome vocals, Recorded loud,production A-1. 10 songs, 43 plus minutes. First track, Ain't Fit to Live Here, blasts out of gate. Mix of slow to up tempo hard rock songs,with psych overtones. Nice progressive and atmospheric break on track 6 Longing. A great listen,start to finish.To my ears, the sound on this disc, kind of reminds me of Scorpions Lonesome Crow,the 1st Lucifers Friend album, and early Uriah Heep. If you are a fan of lesser known 70s hard rock or stoner rock or doom metal, you will want to add this to your collection. One of my all time favorites.Rock On!
B003YT5TGE|5.0|This movie is hilarious even the 5th time you see it. It's a classic, especially if you have ever worked for or in a large office. Everyone should see it at least once. Some foul language and adult situations, so not for young children.
0060512806|3.0|It's not a blockbuster in my mind (but maybe I have an unreasonably high expectation for books) but it's quite a good book. It was tedious at times, but overall an enjoyable read. If you like cyber warfare hacking and such futuristic business you'll like this. There's a lot of probable situations in it (it's not *too* far-fetched) and some interesting ideas, like a digital currency (similar to bitcoins). All in all and interesting read - if you're into cyber crime stuff you'll like this book!

B007L3BMGA|4.0|Despite comments to the contrary from friends & colleagues I enjoyed this novel & I have bought the double sequel.<br />It took a while to get use to the writing style (a criticism by the above detractors).<br />She was a much stronger character than him & the outcome was the right one within the confines of book 1. He was amoral & definitely had commitment issues from a dysfunctional childhood.<br />I thought for some time that her friend may have been a former \\"victim\\". Part of the mystery within he book.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|\\"On an Island\\" is the album on which David Gilmour puts the overwhelming, monumental experience that was Pink Floyd behind him. Not that the guitarist/vocalist disavows his former life as a leader of that internationally famous band; instead, Gilmour simply -- and gently -- finds other musical avenues to explore. A song from the Floyd's penultimate studio album was called \\"On the Turning Away,\\" but that's a title perhaps more apt for this thoughtful, lovely solo album.<br /><br />What must it have been like, to assume the mantle of leadership of Pink Floyd in the mid-1980s when bassist/vocalist/lyricist/conceptualist Roger Waters left the band? Well, Gilmour has hinted in recent years that the pressures were enormous. Nearly all the songwriting duties for 1987's \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" fell to him, drummer Nick Mason having stopped composing and keyboardist Richard Wright having rejoined the band very late in the recording process (Wright had been fired by Waters during the recording of \\"The Wall\\" in 1979). Gilmour did hire collaborators for the lyrics and some music, and by the time of \\"The Division Bell\\" in 1994, Wright was contributing to the music composition.<br /><br />But many fans knew, back then, that Pink Floyd had become very much David Gilmour's band. He and Waters had worked closely together on many PF projects, most notably \\"The Wall,\\" even though they didn't always see eye to eye on production values and such. And according to more than one source, including Nicholas Schaffner's \\"Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey,\\" Columbia Music, PF's American record company at the time, interfered with the recording of \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" when they heard the early mixes, with one exec declaring the music didn't sound \\"a f***ing thing like Pink Floyd.\\" In addition, the usually slender Gilmour gained considerable weight during this rough time -- a sure sign of stress.<br /><br />\\"Lapse\\" was followed by a live album, \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder,\\" which was followed by \\"The Division Bell,\\" which was followed by a live album and DVD both called \\"Pulse,\\" and through it all, the reconstituted, Gilmour-led Floyd toured aggressively. It's no wonder it took Gilmour so long to make another solo album!<br /><br />And it has taken me a long, long time to \\"get\\" \\"On An Island.\\" At first, my reaction was it was rather slight. However, over the years the album has grown on me very much, and I now consider it to be Gilmour's most fully realized solo work (his other two albums being \\"About Face\\" and \\"David Gilmour\\") and also an album that can stand up respectably to Gilmour's contributions to Pink Floyd.<br /><br />My trouble at first was my own -- I was hearing \\"On An Island\\" through the massive prism that is Pink Floyd. That image of light being refracted through a prism on \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" had become emblematic of the band's huge stature -- everything they touched, from 1973 on, seemed to burst into the aural equivalent of a rainbow of colors.<br /><br />But the Floyd's sound also grew increasingly \\"anthemic\\" from \\"Dark Side\\" on: The music, generally, was big and lush and full, and the lyrics ranged from \\"Dark Side's\\" commentaries on world-weary life to madness and faded glory on \\"Wish You Were Here\\" to scathing Orwellian social commentary on \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\" to a searing deconstruction of the rock-star lifestyle on \\"The Wall.\\"<br /><br />Gilmour was wise to turn away from all that and make such a personal album as \\"On An Island.\\" Some of the highlights:<br /><br />\\"Castellorization\\": Sounds somewhat like a Floydian instrumental, but Gilmour's touch on the guitar is a bit gentler than when he was fronting the band.<br /><br />\\"On An Island\\": The title track does have the breezy feel of life on an island; surrounded by water, what can go wrong? Well, for one thing, the simple passage of time -- it never stands still, and the most beautiful of moments also passes. The singer, though, seems to find acceptance in the very temporal nature of all things.<br /><br />\\"Take a Breath\\": \\"Your every breath becomes another world / And the far horizon's living hell.\\" An exploration of living through difficult times.<br /><br />\\"A Pocketful of Stones\\": I definitely think this is another song about Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett, whom Gilmour replaced early in the band's existence because Barrett had a semi-permanent mental breakdown fueled in part by hallucinogens. Certainly the song is less ambitious than the Floyd's opus about Barrett, the 25-minute \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\\" from the album \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" But it's quite moving nonetheless -- the subject of the lyrics, whether it's Barrett or not, displays a somewhat innocent disregard of the \\"real\\" world.<br /><br />\\"Where We Started\\": This full-circle song concludes the album, and simply must be heard to be appreciated. There's a wistful but also satisfied quality to it -- not exactly \\"feel good,\\" but rather the evocation of the human condition: How to fend off melancholy and enjoy the time one has.<br /><br />Six years it has taken me to be able to write this review. As dedicated Pink Floyd fans know, though, time tends to take on a different scale when you're talking about Pink Floyd -- or David Gilmour -- time. It's been nearly 40 years since I started listening to the Floyd, and that's a long time for any one subject to be such an important part of one's life.<br /><br />I imagine David Gilmour feels somewhat the same way. All that history does wash over and through \\"On An Island,\\" but the drama of that great sea that was Pink Floyd does not surge and crash here -- think, instead, of tropical breezes and a cool, sweet sea, swimming with memories. This is a fine album, Mr. Gilmour. Bravo.cceptance in the very temporal nature of all things.<br /><br />\\"Take a Breath\\": \\"Your every breath becomes another world / And the far horizon's living hell.\\" An exploration of living through difficult times.<br /><br />\\"A Pocketful of Stones\\": I definitely think this is another song about Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett, whom Gilmour replaced early in the band's existence because Barrett had a semi-permanent mental breakdown fueled in part by hallucinogens.

0345803485|5.0|A friend told me about the book I myself don't read so I was not to sure but ended up reading all three books in a week and loved them.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|Bought this to go with my Canon EOS Rebel T3i camera and must say it is indeed a resourceful backpack which holds all of my additional camera lens and accessories. Which for a small bag can hold a lot both on the inside pockets and around on the sides which has straps that can secure a small tripod and other items.<br /><br />The bag comes with adjustable separators which can be placed to best suit the items that you require to be stored and does a handy job at keeping them all in place without messing up your flow. The straps on the bag are also adjustable, heavily padded and wide enough along with adjustable waist and chest straps that make the backpack comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this for any camera enthusiast looking for a quality product at an affordable price for storing their valuable merchandise.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I truely enjoyed this book and its sequel. I have ordered but not received the third book in the series, but I expect it to be just as good a read. It has just enough fantasy to make it interesting, and more than enough plot to make it so. It's very hard to put down.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|This album is really smooth. It can be played all day long. It's too good. Definitely a successful purchase. I am very happy with the purchase that I made.
B006OB3K56|2.0|The Shame in this DVD is I wasted nearly 2 hours of my life watching it.<br />The main two characters are sadly disfunctional and I spent the whole film wondering what the point was.<br />It never really became apparent and I found the film dark and depressing. No insight was ever given into why the two siblings were so disfunctional. their downward spiral was gloomy and incredibly sad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I bought the Blu-Ray and have subsequently thrown it in the rubbish as I would not want any of my friends to endure it.
0446572993|5.0|slow start but otherwise great. Mr baldacci just gets better and better! I cried at the end. Well done! Keep this character.

0007853335|5.0|Sadly not quite famous like others, this is one of the best. Agatha Christie wrote good novels, bad novels and great novels. The great ones are wherever she told a beautiful story with beautiful characters, together with a good mystery, clues, twists and atmosphere. This is one of the great.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am 64 and normally do not read pornography but over the years I have been known to pick up a racy book and read it just for the fun of it.  I'm by no means a prude and enjoy sex and those who seem to know a lot about the subject in all its forms whether I practice that form or not.  This book however seems to me to be written by a teenager who is involved with a childish BDSM wannabee.  I literally had to force myself to finish it because 1. I bought it and 2. So I could sum it up for my wife, who didn't want to finish it herself.  I will not buy book 2 and 3.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i love &ccedil;alculator plus!  it works so well and is soooo easy to use!  no problems or complaints at all!  and the best part is is that its free!  i would definetly reccomend this app to my friends snd family!  : )
B008602KQI|1.0|DVD keeps freezing half way through or so.  I'm not the only one with this problem.  Search the web for \\"hunger games dvd freeze\\" and you'll see others with this problem.  May be a bad run of disks, or the newest copy protection causing the usual problems.  If you get a bad one, return it and demand a refund.
B000002KLZ|3.0|Some really good moments and lots of really bad moments -- the live version of \\"It's Not That Funny\\" is annoying, obnoxious and embarassing!  Lindsey Buckingham needs to stop yelling and yelping and try singing instead.  Wish it had a live version of Angel - their best song in my opinion.  Could be a great 1-disc album but too much garbage for 2 discs so can't recommend this.
0345535421|4.0|The story continues. Battles are fought. Some won while others lost. Victory is not always sweet when truths and betrayals stab deeper than the sharpest knives. More enemies are revealed and magic thought gone from their world roars as its strength returns.<br /><br />Clash of Kings; A song of Ice and Fire, Book two by George R.R. Martin is an adventure and fantasy book.  It is too difficult to tell you the outline and what makes this book so good without giving the ending away. Suffice it to say that I read the book from beginning to end. I still had a problem with feeling a bond to the characters and their motivation (there wasn't much for me to grab on to), but the storyline kept me reading. The suspense and adventure was outstanding. I like it that previous characters returned for book two and that amazingly the author found ways to keep them growing. Near the end of the book, I actually felt sorry for Jaime Lannister.
B00004Z4SD|1.0|I was really looking forward to this film after all the great reviews and the fact that Richard Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award.  I've always enjoyed his work and that of Sissy Spacek.  That said, I really hated this movie.  I couldn't tell whether Sissy Spacek's character was supposed to be mentally challenged or had a speech problem or both.  Thirty minutes into the movie absolutely nothing had happened.  When Farnsworth's character finally got going on his journey riding his mower the film got even more boring, if that's possible.  He rode and rode and rode and rode...and got nowhere.  Even if he only went 5 miles per hour, 8 hours per day, his 300 mile trip should have taken only about 8 days.  At one point his mower broke down.  I won't even count this as part of the time his trip.  When all was said and done it took him over 5 weeks.  Nothing happened on his drive.  We were given endless shots of the wheels of the mower or the wheels on the trailer he was hauling.  Endless.  Over and over...and over...and over.  What a waste of great acting talent....and time.  (I know it's based on a true story but I can't help thinking the real story had to have been much more interesting.)
B007PTJOV0|3.0|It is an ok game. I especially like it cause it's free. It needs more of a challenge to it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome....awesome....awesome game!<br />awesome....did I say that this game was awesome?  this is a must get app so get it you wont be disappointed.
B008XM3NZQ|5.0|The greatest movie ever made is finally complete on Blue-Ray. It's restoration is stunning and is an absolute must-have for any Jaws fan. Nuff said?
B00028HBKM|5.0|This film shows us what our Lord and Saviour did for ALL of us in this world.The movie is EXTREMLY violent and graphic,but it is made that way for a reason.This would be a great film to show to an unsaved friend or family member to show them why Jesus went through all that pain and agony. ....so we wouldn't have to (John 3:16)
0345803485|1.0|Everyone has been reading this, as the must have read of the summer.... others couldnt put it down... I found myself choosing sleep....not worth the effort- Slow to develop plot and characters, and right into unrealistic drama.... enough...could not force myself to get through it

B008MEM24S|5.0|love the game. highly addictive and so much fun to play. love playing as Perry the platapuss and trying to beat doctor d.
0345803485|1.0|This book is terrible. I mean the sex scenes were what we cared about and they are very poorly written. I have lived the lifestyle described in this book. I know what it is like to feel the sting of belt across my back. I know what it is like to be humiliated and tormented and, though I love it, the way it is portrayed in this book doesn't convey half f what I feel.<br />If you want a good book filled with this material that is well written go and pick up the claiming of sleeping<br /> beauty. By anne rice. You will love it I promise you.
0385737955|4.0|By:Jack McClain<br /><br />The Maze Runner was an astounding book and never got boring, with all of the cliffhangers, shocks, and surprises.  To be completely honest, I was a bit frightened when I heard the words \\"summer reading\\", but as soon as I began to read this book I was hooked.  I loved it so much; I bought the other two and am anxious for The Kill Order coming out in August this year.  The setting of this book is a place called the Glade: a rundown forest where all of these memory-wiped teenagers call home.  None of them know how they got there, or why, but the runners, the brave Gladers that risk their lives in search of an exit to this traumatic nightmare, go through the maze every day beginning at dawn and come out before night time... or else.  Every night the doors to the maze close and along with it the Grievers: horrific combinations of animal and machine with a lethal sting.  No one has ever survived a night in the maze, even more reason to be scared of it. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the suspense that was in this book and I thought that the plot was well thought out.  Although the book was at times uncomfortably fast-paced, it was a fun read overall.  Every good book needs a main character and in this book his name is Thomas.  Thomas is everything you would want in a main character, and in some cases a hero.  He is courageous, smart, strong, and sometimes comical.  Chuck, another newbie, extended his hand in friendship to Thomas.  At first Thomas replied \\"I don't need friends\\" and walked off stubbornly, but he accepted eventually.  That night, Thomas felt a strange urge to be a runner.  He told Chuck \\"I want to be a runner\\".  Although Chuck replied with a harsh \\"No\\" Thomas still yearned for it deeply.  I feel like most of my questions were answered, but mainly in the next book.  I felt the same way about the other two because some things were left unanswered even in the last book.  This book is a one of a kind and is unique in many ways.  It is an action and a sci-fi, but not one of those predictable books with a nice easy ending.  I do think that James Dashiner, the author, should have answered more questions in the same book and made a better ending for the series.  Overall I liked this book and, in my opinion, would recommend it for boys ages twelve and up because it can be a little scary at times if you chose to read the other two books in this spectacular trilogy, The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure.  Some other books I liked were:  Percy Jackson by Rick Riordian, Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, and Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.  The Maze Runner is my new all time favorite book, and if they make a movie I'll be the first one in line!

B007STBUIW|5.0|When you are anticipating something so much, sometimes you don't get the right feeling for it at first, this happens to me a lot with Blu-ray. My expectations get set a little high. At first I didn't like what I saw, opening beach scene looked gritty, perhaps the lack of light was the big culprit. Even in the water when the girl is being attacked by the shark, still dark and grainy. Who knows, maybe it was shot on a crappier camera, but it doesn't matter anywho, that was me being picky. Come the next day when Brody is summoned to the beach you see Amity Island shine with glourious color and detail! I love the feeling of watching a movie I have seen SO many times before, come alive on Blu-ray because it really seems like I'm seeing it again for the first time. This is why I buy the format. The reason why I will own 3 versions of the same film (6 if its Blade Runner). The soundtrack is one of my favorites of all time! John Williams has never sounded better, the classic Jaws theme rumbles hauntingly with the awesome DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1! Wish I had that many speakers in my house, by my soundbar will suffice, FOR NOW. The only thing that irked me about this release was that Spielberg still has not recorded a commentary track, but I can get past that. People are always calling out for a remake. I say nay! You can never replicate the \\"Hitchcockian\\" vibes that ran beautifully through the film, instead you would get a gore fest in tune with films that are being offered now like Shark Night.<br /><br />It's almost difficult to fathom that this film is almost 40 years old, especially when it provides such a high quality video and audio experience! It really blew my mind! A movie that still holds its own today and will withstand the test of time, Jaws will always have a special place in my life. It both created great fascination and terrorized me at the same time! For this disc, I would go back in the water (and I hardly go in the Ocean).<br /><br />5 Stars outta 5.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm ashamed to admit it, but I nearly skipped Wool simply because I assumed it was a 100 pages or less since it was so cheap.  It's a great read with developed characters and plot twists that keep you page tapping.  Glad I stumbled upon him in Kindle.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote.  I use it on my Kindle Fire, droid phone and laptop.  The fact that it syncs automatically between all three devices is really cool.  I no longer use paper for any notes or appointments.  I am totally addicted to Evernote.
B0061Q13V2|3.0|I really hesitate to write a critical review of a autobiography.  I am sure it is a difficult thing to do.  In any case, I read this after seeing the special about her sister on TV.  I had no previous notions of who Dominique was and I never followed the sport of gymnastics so it was all new to me.  I felt like the author skimmed on the details on some things... saying the coach or her father was mean and she felt afraid or intimidated but not really giving enough specific evidence as to why she felt that way.  It was tough for me to feel sympathy for her.... it is my guess that she was toeing the line between really offending some of those involved.  Anyway, it sounds like everything turned out well for her in the end and I am happy she has built a life that she wanted from such difficult beginnings.

0060555661|5.0|The book arrived in very good condition and in jig time, thus<br />exceeding advertised specs. The book itself is a classic, updated<br />to about 2003 and becomes ever more important as we experience a<br />degree of market volatility unknown in Graham's own day.
B000TEUSJK|1.0|Since movies began back in the early 1900's there has never been a more boring, stupid, plot.  It even has legimate<br />stars at least a couple that is.<br /><br />It is not even titalating, it's just nothing from start to finish.  The owner \\"Penthouse\\" made this disaster and it<br />probably speeded his death.<br /><br />Be warned are you will be bored out of your mind.

B0055PGUYU|3.0|I was absorbed by the premise and found \\"The Power of Habit\\" to be a primer for understanding the basal ganglia. What I found was something entirely different.<br /><br />I read on and was struck by the author's phrase: \\"Habit loops.\\" At first these seemed unique and new. As a counseling psychology graduate student, this was novel territory - exciting! Psychology, habitual behavior, marketing, and the whys were all present. Duhigg breaks down a few marketing successes from: Starbucks, McDonald's, Pepsodent, and Febreeze. All of these companies exploited (or used) psychological tactics to sell more product. I wasn't getting habits as much as case studies in marketing behavior, but that was okay - I assumed Duhigg would get back to individual habits.<br /><br />To change behavior, Duhigg suggests that people look at old habits. For improvement, new routines have to be made. The habit loop includes the: cue, routine, and reward. If you're tired (cue), a cup of coffee can be your routine, followed by the reward of energy. But no matter how strong your changed routine is, Duhigg stresses that belief in one's possibility for change is key.<br /><br />Further along, willpower becomes the focus. The strength to continue on amidst fear, pain, or anxious conditions is willpower. I found this to be the best part of the book - wished the whole book was about this.<br /><br />Unfortunately, by chapter 7, the book disintegrates from its original premise. A case study about Target is featured, and it's identical to the one featured here (published a year before \\"The Power of Habit\\"): [[ASIN:0385531737 Brandwashed: Tricks Companies Use to Manipulate Our Minds and Persuade Us to Buy]]. In fact, the similarities are so tremendous that the layout of stores becomes a focal point, which is exactly what Brandwashed talks about. Duhigg loosely relates these studies to habit, but it seemed weak and purposeless.<br /><br />What sent me over the top was the claim that \\"sleep deactivates theprefrontal cortex and other high cognition areas.\\" In all my years of psychology, this has never been shown. The brain doesn't \\"deactivate\\" upon sleep. Instead, the brain is constantly processing and organizing material. If the prefrontal cortex stopped working, it would likely mean a stroke or severe hemorrhage was occurring.<br /><br />Not once - in all the learning and habit making dialogue - does Duhigg mention classical conditioning's role in learning new behaviors or aiding in habituation. This does a disservice to the reader and paints habit as its own field of study. A habit loop is merely a case of classical conditioning, repeated.<br /><br />To conclude, the author claims, \\"You now know how to redirect the path.\\" This is proceeded by, \\"...This book doesn't contain one prescription [for change].\\"<br /><br />While I found it to be an interesting read, the power of our habits seemed to be muddled.

B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I took my son to see this movie in the theater this summer as part of a $1.00 summer movie program. My son is only 3 years old and had never been to a movie theater before. He completely loved this movie because of the music and the dancing. There is one part in the movie that really had me smiling when all the kids in the entire theater were bouncing up and down in their seats or standing up and dancing because it was so fun! This movie gave me a very precious memory!

B0026WNGBA|5.0|This book has been a life changer for me. After several years away from running I started back about 3 months ago at the age of 52. After a month and a half of some what \\"overdoing it\\" I had to cease training due to sore, tight, swollen calves. I thought I was done. I read Chi Running over the next week while I was recuperating. 8 days after my layoff I ran 2 miles working on the focal points taught in the book. 12 days out I was up to 8 miles. On day 13 6.5 miles pain free (following an 8 mile day).<br />31 days after I thought I was too old for a comeback I ran 22 miles. At mile 20 I thought to myself this is too good to be true. I was ticking off the miles pain free grinning like a madman.<br />This book is an easy read. Instruction on the Chi Running technique is layed out step by step. Anyone interested in pain free running needs to read this book.
1466401885|5.0|sigh!this book is amazing! I wish it were a series, I want to read more!!!I have never read anything so quickly! I just bought it on Fridayand finished it in less than 24 hours in between work shifts! It's so good. I'm going to read Jamie McGuire's Providence series next!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I find it very interesting how Suzanne Collins named Katniss's assault team in reference to the esteemed Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". (A much better book themed on the government's suppression of the masses).<br /><br />I guess the Panemian's still hadn't converted to the metric system, but, naming the team 232.7778 would have been a bit cumbersome.<br /><br />Of course, discovering a bunch of \\"Valley Girls\\" and boys have managed to take over the known world (from Nevada?)is a frightening thought in and of itself. Then again, the series seems to have been written with an easy transition into screenplay in mind.(The special effects story board is already written for them).<br />Perhaps \\"the Valley\\" has already taken over the world after all?
B006CLTFP2|5.0|Really enjoyed the songs on \\"Songs of Anarchy\\" - Katey Sagal is not only a very talented actress, but a talented singer as well - love her version of \\"Strange Fruit\\".  Other favorites tracks off this album are \\"Girl from the North Country\\" by the Lions, Battleme's \\"Hey Hey, My My\\", and \\"Someday Never Comes\\" by Billy Valentine.
B002CPMB9O|5.0|Contains powerful portrayal and keen incite into the motivation and method of one of the key figures in the drugging of the United States. Sufficient detail to include associations and affiliations; more than adequate portrayal of the corruption necessary to support the venture. Fast paced and sufficiently graphic. Could have had a little more depth in the way terror and brutality were used to destroy the lives of anyone, who might not be corruptible but otherwise conveyed the employ of these methods in such manner as to suggest that they were not exclusive to the sewer one would expect them to be used in. Liked the product of society theme and that anyone who rationally chose to follow the path was evil, such as officials at all levels of government. The leaf floating in the currents, a product of the two banks that define the flow. In the end, back on the street, empty: Pockets and Soul.

B0034G4OUY|4.0|Pretentiousness is something I absolutely can't stand in movies. For me, pretentious films, like Never Let Me Go, Sucker Punch, or Meek's Cutoff are much, much harder to sit through than bottom-of-the-barrel BS like Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star, The Roommate, or Vampires Suck. Why? While the BS makes you feel sorry for yourself for ever having sat through it, pretentious flicks just make you mad, because their overinflated egos are right in your face.<br /><br />So, where am I going with this?<br /><br />Because, in the movie-going world, Faster is a revelation of sorts. It is gracefully not BS and thankfully not pretentious.<br /><br />Now, that's not to say it is awards material (although I'd argue the Cinematography is), but in a cinema plagued with trash, Faster is the kind of film you're glad to see because it knows what it is, knows what it isn't, and just tries to make the most out of its B-movie story.<br /><br />Yeah, this is a B-movie. You're not going to stare at the screen and 90 minutes later learn something profound about Humanity's place in the universe. This ain't that kind of movie. From the first shot of The Rock's built up pecs, you're going to see a man's kind of movie with guns, chases, and blood with a neat little throwback to Film Noir and the revenge flicks of the 1970s in between. It is all style and practically no substance.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie you either like or you don't, and there isn't much more to say than that. If what you want in a movie is something the Oscars would fawn all over, this ain't really for you unless you appreciate Cinematography most in a movie. If what you want in a movie is something modest, this is one great way to spend an afternoon.<br /><br />Now, regarding the Blu Ray, the manufacturers did a hell of a job here. The picture is pristine, with a fine layer of grain (the film was shot on 35mm). Colors and Shadows are dead on, with no digital noise and no weird-ass DNR. The sound is a kick to thewoofers, with dialogue perfectly audible and sound effects perfectly triumphant and full of oomph!. A bang-up presentation. Regarding Special Features, the main mini-docs on the cast and crew and cars are practically promos, so they're skippable. What you want to see is the deleted scenes. While they're not merely filler or beats that are take-it-or-leave-it like most deleted scenes, these scenes are so terrible you have to see them to believe them (the alternate ending in particular).<br /><br />However, I must put out something of particular note. While I can't say this is a film I love, it is one I like, and a movie I've managed to have seen more than 10 times. The Blu Ray I received is different than the DVD, almost like a different, more rougher cut of the film. A hymn plays during the opening music number where once there was none. The guards now have dialogue when they didn't before and the prisoners now are audibly clear, where once they were but intimidating and muffled growls and shouts behind glass. Some of the cuts seem more stilted, with the music cues being almost out of place. With the Private Investigator, there are different shots used. This is all within the first 20 minutes. While I didn't see the movie in theaters, this is something I couldn't help but notice in comparison to how I've typically seen the movie before on a DVD. A great presentation still, but one I couldn't help but notice the differences with.

0451209338|4.0|Silva's spy thriller has multi-faceted characters, an interesting plot, and makes the reader long for the next in the series.
0785139168|2.0|it is a fact universally acknowledged that a novel of great popularity must be in want of a comic book adaptation.<br /><br />So it is with Marvel's \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" a loving but deeply flawed comic-book adaptation of Jane Austen's classic. It's obvious that adaptor Nancy Butler really adores the original novel, but the strangely generic character designs and the rushed pace are pretty distracting. Seriously, why has everyone got Botox and blindingly white teeth?<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />First, the positive: some of the art is lovely, and each issue is graced with clever little \\"magazine\\" covers with headlines like \\"Spring's Randiest Ribbons.\\" Nancy Butler has to cut a great deal of the novel out, but for the most part she keeps in the important bits, including the witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the artwork is... deeply flawed. Most of the woman look exactly alike; the only way you can tell Jane, Lizzie, Lydia and Kitty apart is by their hairstyles. And everyone in Regency England seems to have gotten Botox -- nobody really shows any expressions except blindingly white smiles. Lizzie Bennett should not be reminding me of Kristen Stewart!<br /><br />Also, this comic book series could have used another five issues. Everything feels incredibly rushed -- we barely even see Lydia before she elopes. Important scenes are simply smushed together with no transitions. This is especially bad in the final issue, where we careen straight from Jane's engagement to Lady Catherine's verbal abuse to Darcy's proposal in just a few pages.<br /><br />And at times, Butler is too literal in her storytelling. Several times we're shown Lizzy sitting there reading a letter, rather than seeing an ILLUSTRATED FLASHBACK to what the letter-writer is talking about.<br /><br />The Marvel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" tries hard, but it's too short, the characters look too samey, and it's much too rushed. I'll have to keep waiting for a decent adaptation.ith headlines like \\"Spring's Randiest Ribbons.\\" Nancy Butler has to cut a great deal of the novel out, but for the most part she keeps in the important bits, including the witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the artwork is... deeply flawed.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|When a Kindle Book has over 1500 reviews and all all laudatory, that gets my attention.  I have had a love/hate relationship with my Kindle since I got it for Christmas in 2011.  I am never quite certain if I can wrap my head around the fact I am reading an actual book.  WOOL presented a chance to read something good, perhaps great, that was not available in the store.  I have read a ton of Science Fiction, and a bevy of stories dealing with a post-apocalyptic world.  This is simply the best.  For me, characterization is key. I am looking for a multi-dimensional story that places great characters in challenging situations forcing them to become more than they are ... forcing them to become great.  WOOL does it in spades.  Very well-written, it will tear at your heart strings and will keep you turning pages, or touching the screen, or hitting a button, or doing whatever it is you do with your Kindle.  Thanks Hugh. I am going to try out some of your other stuff.

1451678193|5.0|This was Ray Bradbury's first work of fiction, from 1949 when he and his wife were expecting their first child. It's a collection of stories, well-written, compelling, and enjoyable.<br /><br />Besides Fahrenheit 451, I hadn't read anything else by Bradbury. I'm much more used to the science fiction of Robert Heinlein, a luminary in his own right, a man who Bradbury looked up to and considered a major influence.<br /><br />Heinlein was clearly a pioneer in world of science fiction. He lead the pack with his technique of indirection, describing far out worlds--not through a lot of explicit description--but rather subtly through the eyes of his characters. Through this he enabled his readers to use their mind to fill in the details. According to Eric Raymond, he got that from Kipling.<br /><br />That said, I believe there is an area in which Bradbury far excels Heinlein. It is in the lyrical/poetic power of his writing. Bradbury's writing is beautiful in a way that Heinlein's is not. And that beauty shines forth even in this, his earliest published book.<br /><br />Bradbury once said &#34;Libraries raised me. I don't believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries&#34;. It's very clear that, as an author, Bradbury loved reading and he drank very deeply from the works of the best poets.
0060920084|1.0|I loved \\"Walk in the Woods\\" so was expecting something along the same lines.  However, it didn't take long to realize this was not going to be the same funny and entertaining experience.  Shortly into the book it became apparent the book was a vehicle for the author to ridicule everything he dislikes about the US, small-town America, people, and his past. The book is one snide comment after another throughout.  The writing is dull, condescending, judgmental, arrogant, and uninteresting.  Unfortunately, the writing doesn't even entertain because it's not critical-funny, it's mean-unfunny.  The book is page after page of the author telling us how much better he is than everyone else.  Save your time and skip this one.

1476712042|5.0|This is not YA. Regardless of what people tag it as, it is not YA. Yes, Abby is in fact a young adult at the age of 19 but what most would classify as a YA book, this is not something a 15yr old should be reading. This is more contemporary romance. Maybe even Contemporary Dramatic Romance... is that even a genre? If not, I dub thee the first contemporary dramatic romance!<br /><br />This is a story about a girl trying to leave her (not so pretty) old life behind and trying to start over new in college, who meets a guy from the wrong side of the tracks. He fights for money, drinks, smokes and sleeps with a new female every night. What starts off as a friendship quickly turns into a tumultuous relationship that is nothing less than rocky throughout the entire book... and it was highly entertaining.<br /><br />All too often you read books where the leading male is perfect. Perfect face, smile, teeth, behavior, job... (are you picturing Ken yet? Perhaps Prince Charming?). Let's not forget all the \\"Barbie\\" protagonists that I've read book after book. The girl always meets her prince charming and they ride off into the sunset like the ending to a Disney movie. If that is what you're interested in reading then do not read this book. This is not the book for you. Their relationship is rocky right from the start. They are both hard headed, hot blooded... and for lack of a better term, white trash. Travis grew up with a rough childhood. He now pays his bills by fighting in a campus version of UFC. Abby grew up with a gambling father. A man who made it to the top of the poker world, but has since found his self scratching away at the bottom, blaming his daughter for his fall from poker fame. Rumor has it, Abby stole all of her father's luck when she was younger and he's taken the rumor to heart. Either way, when you put these two together you get a relationship that is just shy of calling the police for domestic abuse.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. Yes there were times when I was shouting at my Nook for Abby to pull her head out of her butt and realize that Travis was manipulating her. Or the fact that I wanted to beat the crap out of Travis for acting like a jerk towards Abby when he didn't get his way. However, the dysfunctional relationship worked. There was no bad villain in this book or any climatic points in my opinion. Just a story about that one volcanic relationship that we've all witnessed. You know the one where they go back and forth between fighting and making up. I've seen a couple of friends go through this type of relationship. This stuff happens, it's real and I applaud the author for writing about it. Hopefully girls and guys read this book and take away how unhealthy and abusive the situation is and not how romantic and in love they are.<br /><br />-Book Sniffers Anonymouss when I was shouting at my Nook for Abby to pull her head out of her butt and realize that Travis was manipulating her.

B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Very exciting movie that was surpring and action packed. There was a lot of attention to detail that made the movie worth more than a story.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't get what all the hype is about. Be it good or bad. I found the story to be mediocre and the writing was pretty amateurish. There were a lot of filler pages in the story between emails being sent back and forth between Ana and Christian, and the many pages of the contract Ana has to sign in order to become Christian's submissive. I think with a good polishing by an editor and maybe some re-writes on the authors part would benefit this book a lot.<br /><br />-Book Sniffers Anonymous

034580404X|3.0|With so much hype about the first book, Fifty Shades of Grey, I wasn't sure if I even wanted to read it. In a what the heck moment, I ordered the Trilogy. I am so glad that I did. Yes, the first few chapters are so poorly written it isn't even funny. But once you get into the story, yes it does have some steamy parts and could be considered controversial, but if you ever enjoyed a romance novel before, then that is exactly what you will be getting! In the genre, the man is always good looking, wealthy, talented and caters to every whim of the heroine. Isn't that what a romance book should be all about? Maybe this one explores colorful sexual exploits, but it also shows the willingness to try something new and the lengths people will go to to make the one they love happy.<br />If you are on the fence about buying it, then don't. But if you are more than a little curious, go ahead and do it.

Greatest review is when someone from the audience this movie was targeted to just simply states \\"Dad that was total Garbage, no story, no plot and no interesting characters - can you send it back?\\"  Buyer beware on this one, get it from the $0.99 bin if its not already there.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I am very happy with this product. Fast, cool, and the right price. As usual, I am glad I stuck with AMD when I decided to make the next major upgrade. I am by no means an expert, nor am I trying to squeeze every drop of power. All I want is for things to work. I got all of that and more, but only after a BIOS upgrade (a bug did not allow some games to work). After which everything worked fine. I am very happy with this product, and would recommend this highly.
0545403359|2.0|He must be good...MM sells so many books, has such a record of kindness to children...this one is a film, a stage play, presented all over the world...Well, I'm sorry:  I think it's trite, formulaic, and does less justice to the WWI warriors than it could!<br /><br />Of course horse and rider will be re-united at end of book, just as they are in 'Black Beauty';  of course this horse will survive, and come home, when millions were killed or sold off to the French.  Kids want a happy ending...don't they?  Once again MM serves it up.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Instead of angry birds, this game should be called Addictive Birds.  Once you start playing you cannot stop.  Especially when you get stuck on a particular level and want to desperately finish it.  Even my husband likes this one.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game.  Me and my brother always have fun play on it at granny's house. it is truly a fun game to play.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played card games since I was a child.  This game is easy to play and keeps you amused for a long time.  I've used it on the airplane, in a car, camping, etc.<br />It is just like playing real solitaire with cards.  My only complaint recently was that every time I reset for a new game, stupid ads would pop up.  I just want to play the game.  Never had this happen before and don't know why it just started, other than I was at home and have a wireless connection to the computer.  Not sure if that was the cause.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great game with tones of replay value only issue is on brand new kindle fire it still has lag at times and everyonce and a while it wont register a finger gesture which stinks because you start over.  If devs could make it run a little smoother would def be 5 stars.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Wow!  I absolutely loved this book (you must read Book 2 - Shadow of Night!).  Truly couldn't stop reading it...and that says alot for me!  Love the fantasy of a vampire/witch romance.  Both intelligent/educated characters with lots of sexual tension and great dialogue.  This is the way a vampire story should be told...predator and prey...leaving you on the edge...wanting more!  My only disappointment in both this book and Shadow of Night (Book #2 in the series) is that the author introduces some quirky characters and dialogue towards the end of each novel, taking the characters and story out of sync.  Sometimes, she also doesn't dwell long enough in certain emotional circumstances when you're needing to find out more what the characters are feeling.  Otherwise, a great writer and story-teller.  Looking forward to the final book in the trilogy (hopefully not too long!).
0439023521|5.0|Very well written novel with a chilling, creative, and strikingly close to home story. It will draw you in and hold you till the end... and into the next book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I could not put this trilogy down. I am so excited to see the movie and put faces with the names.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Possibly even better than the first, which is saying a lot. Be prepared to be taken on a wild ride that will keep you reading till the end.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Well it's about time. Works beautifully on my DROID bionic and Kindle Fire. Pictures are a smidge slow to load on both devices, but its a small price to pay for the functionality.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|The acting was really great.  The story could have been better in the movie; unsure how it compared to the book, as I did not read it.<br /><br />If you go to the movies a lot, you may be impartial to this movie.  If you don't go very often, it is a real treat.

0140120416|5.0|I'm currently studying chapter 5, but looking the book over, and based on my experience so far:<br /><br />There is a lot packed in this book, including the Russian-English and English-Russian dictionary in the back, of words used in the lessons. The book appears to be very thorough in the essentials of Russian grammar, and a good introduction to Russian vocabulary. I most appreciate the dialogues and exercises at the end of each lesson with complete keys in the back. It's not easy, and there may be easier resources for learning the language at a much greater cost. That said, this book appears to deliver a lot for the buck if you are willing and persistent to make the effort.<br /><br />For pronunciation, I would suggest online audio resources (such as online translators for learning the pronunciation of individual words) or, better, help from a native speaker.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Trombone Shorty is a fresh sound with a heritage of Louis Armstrong, The Meters, Galactic and everything New Orleans. If you have not seen Troy, you need to be nice to yourself and join the party. Sweet lyrics and a smooth sound with funk is waiting for you.<br /><br />I have watched the group's development for years now and am excited about where it is going. Love this album with lots of great guest artists (you think they know something and want to be part of it?).

B0054R6BFM|4.0|Brilliantly written!  This book really hit home. At times I had to put the book down because I knew exactly how Hannah felt.  A flood of emotions would hit me, because it was as if the book was written about me.  However, I finished the book in three days. The author did an amazing job getting into the heads of the characters. loved it, its a must read!

B004SGWYVA|5.0|What would you do if a zombie apocalypse happened? High School of the Dead puts you in the shoes of a 17 year old high school student named Takashi. Everyday is the same old same old. But suddenly he comes face to face with an unbelievable situation: a zombie apocalypse. Takashi forms a group with his friends and must think smart if they want to survive.<br /><br />This show is one of my favorites. It's got everything a guy wants; zombies, guns, boobs, chicks! It has a great plot and the characters fit nicely with each other.  This anime really actually makes you think, what would i do if this happened to me? This anime captures many realistic elements. Even though this story is kind of dark, it has a lot of humor. It has a lot of \\"fan service\\" but i cant complain im a guy so haha. You learn to get used it. Some others think that this show could have been better with out it, but in my opinion thats what makes it unique. The Blu-Ray really makes this anime shine. The drawings are crisp and clear. The soundtrack to this show is also adds a nice touch. The opening song is one of my favorite. The collection includes two Blu-Ray disks with all 12 episodes. Some extras are included such as clean openings/endings and the ability to change to the japanese voice actors. I would NOT recommend this show to anyone under 16 due to the scenes of sexual content. But to anyone over that ENJOY! This anime is great to a collection and will be an instant favorite!
0099579936|2.0|This novel leaves me disgusted and thankful I did not purchase the trilogy. it has taken centuries for humanity to identify controlling behavior as abusive and this novel glamorizes it. I will not recommend this book to anyone!

B0046ECFRM|4.0|This was a really cute & sweet story of love & friendship.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd like Anna at first as I thought she was a wee bit moany & naive when it comes to boy's with the typical no experience but is an absolute-beauty-but-she-doesn't-know-it type thing going on but she really grew on me within the first few chapters.<br /><br />And Etienne St Clair is just as dreamy & tortured as all our other fav book boyfriends :)<br />Though I have to say I did want to strangle him at times cause I was so frustrated with his decisions but to be fair the author does a good job of explaining why he does what he does & Anna isn't without her faults either & I needed to remind myself that these are 2 clueless teenagers which I once was myself :)(long looooooonnnnng ago)<br /><br />Paris is also a huge character is this book, she hates it, she loves it, she wants to go home, it is home. I love Paris so any book based there is gonna score major points with me.<br /><br />I guess the reason the book lost a star for me is that there is nothing really new going on here but because it was told beautifully it worked all the same.<br /><br />This is a perfect light fluffy YA romance for in between more hardcore angst ridden books. Or if you just like a really cute tale of best friends to lovers.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading Lola and the Boy Next Door

B007EC6FIS|4.0|Keane have come back with a long awaited return to their piano sound.It is a very twinkly piano sound in most tunes. I think the edge is gone from them. They wrote far better songs when the band was going through rough times. Under the Iron Sea for example. It was dark and mysterious but was still fun to sing along. I swear that record is a religious experience for me. This record is nice. It has Tom's vocals which are back to the soaring type we love. Tim Rice-Oxley has written lyrics that we all can relate to. \\"The Starting Line\\" is one of those songs. Sovereign Light Cafe is a good song. I like the second half of the record better. It has songs that are not anthem oriented. Neon River captures love lost in the typical TRO heartfelt way. Black Rain(anti-war song) and Sea Fog all get the tune back in your head when you hear the title. Any Keane fan loves to sing the songs in the car to their favorite songs. This record has some of those songs but for some reason I do not want to play this cd over and over again like H and F and UTIS. I can not explain it. I think the boys have put out a solid but unspectacular record. But, I will take it. Far better than the last two and it makes me look forward to the next record. There is a B side out now called Difficult Child. It is on their web site. Now, that is a really good song. I really do wonder sometimes about the song choices for records. Especially after I hear some of the B-sides. \\"On a day like today\\", \\"Snowed Under\\",\\"Fly to Me\\",\\"To The End Of The Earth' and there are more. These songs should have been included in some of their previous records. Only an opinion. If you are a Keane fan I would get this record. But, I have to say some of the luster has gone off the bloom since 2008.

014241543X|2.0|I was given this book as an assignment for a literacy class.  Upon asking to write a novel recommendation for it, I was upset that I couldn't write a positive review.  I do not think that I could let my students read this.  Even though it is easy to love the characters in this novel, I felt very depressed reading it.  I felt that the negative feelings I had outweighed the positives.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this trilogy! It does have some points through out the series I thought to myself really?? What were they thinking. None the less. I loved the characters, that is what the trilogy is about the characters. They were from two different worlds and learned from and each other and grew together as a couple. Others have posted reviews and made comments on the authors writing, excuse me are you a writer? Do you have a book or in this case books on the best sellers list? I doubt it. Read them they are fantastic. I will definitely ready again. Loved them. Laters, Baby.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The book was a bit too long.  Suggest it could have been broken into two books. A reader could be lost or forget what happened in the story line of character from the beginning to the end by the time you reach 3/4's of the way through.  Ending of this Dragons was unexpected.

B005FISBTO|5.0|My wife and I began watching Dexter Season 6 as soon as it arrived a few days ago and finished watching it last night.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Showtime/CBS Video includes a long advertisement for Showtime on each disc that includes various clips from shows that will be on during the upcoming Fall 2012 season.<br /><br />You cannot fast forward through them, hit the menu option, or anything else. You are forced to watch the entire ad to get to the menu on each of the three discs. So, we watched the trailer waiting for the menu option on disc one.<br /><br />With that said, the clip that Showtime/CBS chose to use for Dexter in this ad happens to be the final 15 seconds of Season 6.<br /><br />That's correct, they show the closing scene of season 6 on the Dexter: Season 6 DVD. Amazing!<br /><br />We won't ruin it for you here, but the clip that they use not only is the closing scene of Season 6, it sets up Season 7.<br /><br />Shame on Showtime/CBS Video for ruining Season 6 for first time viewers. We waited an entire year for the release and learned exactly how the season would end thanks to a pre-menu ad before we even watched the first episode.<br /><br />Not everyone buys various seasons to watch a second time. We do not have Showtime and rely on the DVD releases to watch Dexter each year.<br /><br />We hope this helps other potential buyers. DO NOT WATCH THE PRE-AD IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SEASON 6. Mute the volume and walk out of the room for about four minutes and the menu will be on when you return.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I just finished reading this much-hyped book.  What a disappointment!!  E.L. James is not disappointed with the sales I am sure.  The writing was not very good, nor were the characters even likeable. If you like a book laden with tales of non-vanilla detailed sexual interplay, then you will like this book. As they say, sex sells, and this is exhibit one.
1476712042|1.0|I bought this on a whim in Target...What a waste of money on this book. This is a riduculous teen romance with a few sex scenes thrown in. The writing is SO BAD!! The plot is completely all over the place, and unbelievable. The main character, Abby is also more than unbelievable. She is not likable at all, and more an indecisive loon. There are so many negative things about this book, I am shocked there are so many 5 star reviews. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.
1848313470|5.0|This is an up-to-date superbly written account of the modern explosion of information about epigenetics. Dr Carey writes with a blend of expert professional knowledge and an ability to convey complex ideas in simple language. This is a model of what a scientific text should be.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A complete page turner, could not put this book down. Really makes you think for days after you have finished reading it. How would you handle a situation similar to this and do we create our situations and are we stuck with them as we know it.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|This is truly an epic and sweeping portrayal of probably the most famous name in the Old West. At over three hours, by the time you're through you really feel like you know something about every period of the great lawman's restless life, as he moves from town to town and situation to situation.<br /><br />To its credit, the movie sticks fairly accurately to the actual events of Earp's life, from his teenage years to his maturity, although no doubt some artistic liberties were taken (he has twice the actual number of brothers, for one thing), but I'm not expert enough on the detailed history to catch the rest. The all star cast all turn in solid performances, but the stand out is Dennis Quaid, whose ailing Doc Holliday is really the high point of the whole film. He steals every scene he's in, but Costner also shines as Earp in an understated performance that was probably truer to the lawman's real character in his stolid disposition and quiet determination no matter how desperate things got.<br /><br />No movie about Earp would be complete without the iconic gunfight at the OK Corral, which takes place about 2/3 of the way into the movie, along with many other significant events in Earp's life. Gene Hackman does a fine job in a brief role at the beginning of the movie as Earp's savvy father, who is an educated man and an attorney, more reflective and cerebral than his son, who seems destined despite himself to be more the man of action. Add to the mix a fine script and some beautiful cinematography, and this is one of the few great westerns made since the decline of the genre in the 60s.<br /><br />By the way, just a little trivia note here, Wyatt and his wife are buried in a Jewish cemetery (his wife, Josie, was Jewish) in Colma, California, not far south of San Francisco. I used to live a few miles from there for many years and you can visit the grave site if you want and pay your respects.

B0085A9HXS|4.0|Brief and to the point: if you enjoy hardcore action films like \\"Time And Tide\\" (one of the best ever), \\"District B-13\\", \\"Fulltime Killer\\", \\"Police Story III: Supercop\\", \\"Ong Bak\\", \\"Tom Yum Goong\\", \\"Chocolate\\", \\"Born To Fight\\", \\"Ip Man\\", \\"Invisible Target\\", \\"So Close\\", \\"Death Trance\\" and \\"Unleashed\\", then this Indonesian film is a must-buy. My wife is from Indonesia and she did the literal translation even though English subtitles are provided and get this: all the \\"cuss\\" words in the subtitles were never spoken in the film; amazing ain't it? The character \\"Mad Dog\\" played by Yayan Ruhian (He is a beast; look out Tony Jaa, Jet Li, Wu Jing and Tak Sakaguchi). Highly recommended and a must-buy for action and martial arts film lovers!!!
B008M0UTRO|5.0|Beautiful movie! I loved it! It was featured last year at the Toronto International Film Festival. I adored the \\"simplicity\\" of the story, which only makes it more beautiful. I have watched it many times now. I would totally recommend it to people that like and value this kind of japanese anime as well as beautiful and honest stories. I absolutely adored that this version I purchased through Amazon is in its original language (japanese) with english subtitles.

0393976041|5.0|It is a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen is a most accomplished novelist. Before embarking on Pride and Prejudice I never read any Jane Austen novels, but I heard a lot of comments from her fans. It is no coincidence that a character in The Bridget Jones Diary was named Mr. Darcy, and Clueless is also loosely based on an Austen novel. There is also a film called Becoming Jane, about the formation of the novelist, and another called The Jane Austen Book Club, where the reading of and discussion of her novels sparks a bit of gossip and matchmaking of its own. It is pretty impressive, all of this continued interest, considering that she wrote them over 200 years ago. I thought they would be mostly about gossip and matchmaking, and primarily of interest to women. That turned out to be true, about the concerns with gossip and matchmaking, but the way that Jane Austen wrote about such things was quite interesting, to men or women of a thoughtful bent. There was a thorough analysis not only of the social customs and structure, but also of the motivations and psychology of the people. You could enjoy it on the level of gossip and matchmaking, or you could go much deeper.<br /><br />One thing that was really interesting was how it summed up peoples' level of interest. For instance, Mrs. Bennett, the mother, was depicted as being silly and superficial; her thoughts were consumed with getting her five daughters married off. Her favorite daughter was Jane, who had the best prospects of getting married, as she was handsome and of a congenial nature. Elizabeth was much more critical, and even turned down offers. The father favors Elizabeth, however, because he sees that she is a deep thinker. The younger Miss Bennetts, Lydia and Kitty, care only about officers, clothes and balls, where they will get a chance to flirt, dance with the officers, and show off their clothes. Mr. Collins, a clergyman, is also silly and impractical, in his own way. He is mostly concerned with currying favor with his patroness, Lady Catherine.<br /><br />But it is Elizabeth Bennett who is the focus of the book, and her troubled courtship with the difficult Mr. Darcy that provides the main point of conflict. The narrative voice seems to be privy to Lizzy's innermost thoughts, but at times it almost seems like the voice is Elizabeth herself, but older and wiser, looking back on her younger self. The narrator is extremely polite, but sometimes does get off a few zingers at the folly and foibles of the people. The negative commentary is mostly conveyed in the voices of the characters, with Eliza Bennett leading the charge.<br /><br />There is plenty of witty banter, and also a lot of drama that really involves the reader. You will wonder how Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth will ever get together, given all the obstacles they face--the main one being that they can't stand each other. How will Jane and Mr. Bingley get together, what with the meddling of his sister and his friend, Mr. Darcy? Even though the story is mostly gossip and matchmaking, you have no trouble reading through to the end, because Jane Austen is a masterful story teller and a keen observer of human nature. Her portraits of the kind of people you meet in the world are surprisingly accurate, which is even more astonishing when you consider that she wrote more than 200 years ago. Her stories have been the basis for many films, both period dramas and updates, because her uncanny ability to capture the various types of people that make up this crazy world rings true. Jane Austen reveals universal truths about men and women, and that is why her popularity continues unabated.with currying favor with his patroness, Lady Catherine.<br /><br />But it is Elizabeth Bennett who is the focus of the book, and her troubled courtship with the difficult Mr. Darcy that provides the main point of conflict.

0345803485|1.0|This book was awful!  I started to read this after \\"The Girl that Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\"  Never again, ... will I take a random recommendation from a friend of the spouse!<br />If you like porn, you will probably like this.  However, I like to be \\"engaged\\" within a thinking process and that does not include how many ways an author can look up how to excite a reader<br />in what it would be like to put the \\"Kama Sutra\\" in a so-called modern fantastical practice, and then change it to a so called \\"tale of love.\\" See any similarities?  Forget Twilight!  (Personally, never read and could not bring myself to watch past 30 minutes into the movie).  Please!!  BORING! Sex may sell, but that just tells you how simple minded the buyers are.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I enjoyed the availability of choosing your own combination of sounds. ive been experimenting with different sounds. the orchestra with the very dramatic beat makes u feel as if ur in a movie. I wish there was more options for melody's and music plain nature sounds r good for just background stuff but overall really nocked me out!
0385344228|4.0|It's been a long time since I read a book that surprised me like this one has. It is refreshingly original, has characters you can believe and care about. I didn't see the ending coming. I would definitely recommend this book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A book tricked me into reading it.<br /><br />If I had known it was about war and Nazi Germany, I never would have.<br /><br />Somehow, probably the same way I thought The Hunger Games was about more vampires (and avoided it for years),  I got the idea that The Book Thief was a middle grade fantasy (and checked it out from the online library). By the time I realized my mistake, it was too late.<br /><br />I was hooked. And I'm glad.<br /><br />Normally, I shy away from sad books and movies. And yet, The Book Thief  by Markus Zusak manages to bring happiness into the sadness, kind of like life. Even a very hard life. The hardest kind of life.<br /><br />I love the imagery. Papa's eyes were \\"like soft silver, melting.\\" Wow.<br /><br />I love the themes, especially the one of books and writing. Once we let them go out into the world, there's no telling where our words will land.<br /><br />The narrator is perfect. Zusak paints a warm and resonant portrayal of Death.<br /><br />Everything about this book is amazing, poignant, inspiring, touching, painful, exquisite, and beautiful...heart-wrenching and heartwarming all at once. In short, this is masterful storytelling and wordsmithing at its very best.<br /><br />You should read it. You'll be glad you did, too.
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|Love all the Sex and the City shows and movies, although this one could have had a better story line. I think the location for Sex in the City should stay in the city. Didn't care for the choice of location for this movie at all. On a good note, it still made me laugh unless, of course, it was a serious scene.
B0007LGCB8|3.0|Although I believe that Keen is one of the better sandals out there, the sizing issue is a problem. Several Keen buyers have expressed the same complaint to me. I sent these back for the next size up. After paying for shipping on the second pair, and yes, I'm a prime member, but still have to pay, the second pair fits snug, but acceptable. Overview is that the Keen size issue coupled with Amazon's poor service lowers the overal rating on these shoes for me...
B0001MLMKY|4.0|I have had a Swatch watch for many years.  When I went to replace the latest one.  I got one with a magnifier on the date.  Now when the time is 15 minutes after the hour, it is hard to see the correct time.  Get rid of the Magnifier.  PS Is there some way to remove the magnifier?
B008TRUDAS|4.0|A different love story, simple but heartwarming. The writing is beautiful. Love all the poems! Look forward to reading more books from the author in the future!

B008XG1X18|5.0|I've been waiting for this app to finally come to the kindle fire. Used several times today with no problem.  I now have no reason to use my laptop any longer.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so cool. I love the graphics and the controls work great. The game is really hard to put down. I can't believe it is free. Thanks Halfbrick!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great puzzle game.  The 5x5 grids are too easy but the 9x9 grids offer a nice challenge.
B00275EHJG|2.0|If I had to leave a theater for attending a G rated film Id be pissed. Total screw up by the mpaa for rating it G. Or was it a deal to get more tickets sold? A G rating is supposed to mean lets go to the movies and not have concern over how your toddler/young kid is going to react. By far this is a PG. That  isn't an issue as long as its promoted as what it is. For an adult its a great film. For a toddler its scary. For a kid either or anywhere in between.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|This is the best season so far for Breaking Bad.  A lot happens and it is very exciting!  Walter has lost his teaching job, his wife believes he is a drug dealer but is attracted to the money.  Hank has a terrible accident defending himself from the Mexican cousins who came from Mexico to kill Walter and Jesse.  Jesse and Walter go over the edge into true badness by taking lives.  The suspense is very strong in this season and to tell too much would ruin the show but Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul definitely deserved their Emmys.  I'm surprised that it hasn't won the Best Drama but there is a lot of competition out there.
B007STBUIW|5.0|The picture looks BETTER than any theatrical 35mm print I'd ever seen in a theater, with blacker blacks and richer color! I'm so glad Universal went back to the ORIGINAL NEGATIVE and restored it before striking a first-generation print for this beautiful transfer, as this is truly one of their landmark, groundbreaking, legacy releases. There's a REASON this film scored record-breaking box-office, Oscar accolades and critical reviews. It is a timeless classic!<br /><br />The 7.1 surround sound is expansive. There are now 360-degree splashes happening all around you during the 4th of July Amity beach panic scene (YES!!!), something that was sorely absent from the previous, overall excellent, 5.1 surround re-mix for DVD. Several \\"legacy\\" sound-FX, from the original 1975 mono mix that were sorely absent in the previous 5.1 surround DVD mix, including the original whale sound behind the guys at the dinner table in the Orca at night, and the final  rifle bullet ricochet off the scuba tank in the shark's mouth at the end, have, happily, been reinstated!<br /><br />For purists, like myself, the original 1975 mono soundtrack is also included (it is English 2, 2.0 Mono, in Settings, from the Main Menu, under Audio)! John Williams' \\"Da-dum...\\" music is MUCH LOUDER, CLEARER, MORE PREVALENT OVER SOUND-EFFECTS, in the mono mix than in the 7.1 surround mix! In the 7.1 surround mix, while expansive and atmospheric, John Williams' music, which is so much a part of the impact of Jaws, has been way too artificially reverbed, sounds thin, and tends to get drowned out by sound-effects. It's still a great-sounding mix overall, but many Jaws fans, like myself, will actually PREFER the mono track, for really hearing John Williams' music, and for restoring Jaws to its classic, legendary, \\"nightmarish summer of 1975 horror film\\" status.<br /><br />All the extras (except the \\"teaser\\" trailer, with animated \\"teeth\\" chomping down on bathers legs in several underwater shots over John Williams' tell-tale \\"thump thump\\" music, and text saying \\"This summer...when the beaches are open...and the water is warmer...you will be taken by...JAWS\\") are included from the 25th and 30th Anniversary DVDs.<br /><br />There is a new and delightful documentary, \\"The Shark is Still Working\\", which was apparently compiled over many, many years, and which includes new interviews with the entire cast and crew, many of whom (Roy Scheider, Peter Benchley, David Brown, and now, Richard D. Zanuck) are, sadly, deceased. None of us are going to live forever, and these guys have collectively created a classic that IS immortal, that WILL live on, as long as there are sharks in the water!<br /><br />The Shark is Still Working documentary chronicles many, many new facets about the plagued production and the Jaws phenomenon never-before-seen. Especially amusing is JawsFest, a reunion at Martha's Vineyard, where fans got to meet cast members, touch the mechanical shark in its original mold, and see Jaws projected on a giant screen right in front of the water, the docks of \\"Amity\\", where Jaws was filmed! Hearing die-hard fans recite their favorite lines with the film, Rocky Horror Picture-style, is a real treat! JawsFest is the Star Trek convention for die-hard Jaws fans!<br /><br />Pump it out, Chief, and throw some chum in the water. Just drop that rope, Hooper, or you'll lose your hands!
031617615X|1.0|I cannot say enough about how atrocious the writing was in this book. I reluctantly admit to reading the entire Twilight series (peer pressure!) and will say that the first installment was definitely the best. Yes, the writing was mediocre in that book too but the love story was so intense, it was easy to overlook. Book after book, the writing got worse and the fluff intensified. Did the book need to be so wordy? I don't think so. The author could have presented the story in half the pages she used. It took me a really long time to get through this book because it was such a frustrating read. Chapters with asinine titles such as \\"Why didn't I just walk away? Oh right, because I'm an idiot\\" and \\"Life sucks and then you die. Yeah, I should be so lucky\\" only add to the ridiculousness of this \\"novel\\". I do not recommend this disastrous book to anyone over the age of 18. And yes I do realize this was marketed as Young Adult fiction.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|I can't think of a horror movie I find more disturbing. It's incomprehensible that something like THIS is rated PG 13, but a naked body in a movie is a huge drama.<br /><br />I kept hoping the kids would find a way to take the excitement out of the slaughter and end the senseless yearly massacres for good, but they didn't. They just kept killing each other.

0439023521|3.0|Now I know Im gonna get hate mail for this one, I personally feel that the Hunger Games is an extremely overrated bookseries, number one reason being the writing. Suzanne's writing is symplistic and blunt, with few \\"scholarly\\" sentences to be found. Also, the fact that the novels are written in the present tense is really irritating and detracts from the writing. However, despite this, I do enjoy the story (of the first and third books). The brutality behind these novels is nice, for it does a wonderful job of dampening the overly cheesy/pointless emotional moments. I like the politicking in these books, however, and i feel that Suzanne Collins is good in terms of creativity, but her writing leaves much to be desired. Aww well, I read these books, watched the movie (which i prefer), and am awaiting Catching Fire's release in movie format (In the movie they will have to leave out some of the emotional confusion which made the book annoying).
0345803507|5.0|This trilogy is by far the best books I have ever read. Well, I have read the first two anyway, and once I started, I couldn't stop. They bring up all kinds of emotions when reading. It contains the power to make you feel happy, sad, embarrassed, angry, and so many more. Yes, this book is very sexual, but not as bad as others make it sound. It is an incredibly interesting love story that just happens to give us all of the details of the \\"lovemaking\\", unlike most books, and trust me, when all the knitty-gritty sex scenes happen in books, you can't tell me we wouldn't all love to know more. I think E.L James was very brave in writing this book, as it has been explained as a \\"porno\\", and people seem to judge her skills harshly. BUT COME ON PEOPLE, sex is a natural thing, and wanting to know more about it isn't a bad thing, and most people like to, secretly. I went into reading these books expecting over-the-top sex details, and trust me I got them, but the books offered so much more than just that. If you read it, trust me, you'll be surprised, in a good way!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I am absolutely hooked on this game all of them.  I have all of them that are out there now and I. am waiting for more.  They are so so much fun and hard to put down. Try them free and you too will be Hooked just like me.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is very cool, probably the funnest and longest lasting android app that I've ever bought. It is the Japanese puzzle game of hanjie, or nonogram.<br /><br />I have tried these puzzles in puzzle books that I bought in Japan, and I always used to mess them up, because if you make one wrong move, it usually ruins the puzzle. So, you have to be very, very careful. So having a ton of these puzzles helped me to hone my skills, and I've finished about 80% of the 250+ puzzles. I think it took me about 80 hours so far, so this is great value.<br /><br />As soon as I finish all of the puzzles, I'm definitely buying the sequel, [[ASIN:B008D28HYS CrossMe Color]]<br /><br />And, it records your entire game history, and you can undo it to the beginning, so you can test out hypothetical situations (required on the super advanced puzzles).<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Tons of puzzles, with every difficulty level<br />+Very fun<br />+Awesome value!<br />+They keep updating the app and adding even more puzzles<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Very, very easy to accidentally touch the wrong place on the screen and ruin your game. They should make optional settings so it makes a click sound and/or vibrates when you make a move<br />-You really need a tablet to do these puzzles, because there's a lot of information in a very tight space. I did mine on my [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]]<br />-Some puzzles (less than 5) haven't been tested all of the way. You should be able to do the whole puzzle without guessing, and I ran into a few puzzles that required guessing (even though it was obvious what the answer was)
0307279189|5.0|This book is phenomenal. Not only is it a page-turner and so well-written but rich in historical and scientific facts about human endurance from very early on in our history. If you want to be reminded of the miracle that is the human body and its' abilities, there is no better source. Most importantly, this book captures the spirit that should be the essence of running, and all other endeavors. Read it and find out!

B004LZF2LW|4.0|This is s a useful and interesting app. While I used to \\"monitor\\" the world with iSpy Cameras, the data costs became too great, and I find that this app provides me a similar function without the data cost.<br /><br />It allows one to set a large number of clocks around the world, and keep track the time in each location. It also provides graphics in the form of either a flat world map or a globe, both of which are interactive.<br /><br />It seems to be well behaved and use few resources.<br /><br />Since I have friends in various places around the world, it is nice to have a quick, graphic guide to their local time zone, so I don't accidentally contact them in the middle of their night. It is also just a nice way to get a \\"gut-level\\" appreciation for the movement of light and dark around the planet, which I find keeps me in better touch with the natural world.<br /><br />Recommended.
B002R22PB6|5.0|Javier Bardem is one of Spain's most expressive leading men and has recently begun a new career in Woody Allen's VICKY, CRISTINA, BARCELONA. His struggle with suicide in this film is certainly operatic and the films locations in Galicia give an added natural dimension to his inner mental struggles.  Beautifully acted and performed by all players in this touching film.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|Finally! A book priced where the author makes a profit and I get my discount for using a Kindle! These 12 and 13 smackeroo books are absurd. If I'm not going through a publisher who has to PRINT and SHIP the book I deserve a deep, deep discount.<br /><br />So authors/publishers take note: I bought this book BECAUSE of the price. Yes, I was interested in the book but would not purchased at the inflated prices asked for other Kindle books.<br /><br />This offers the convenience of seeing if I enjoy the book wo/ having to shell out the price of lunch to do it. If I like it, I'll recommend it to everyone. If not, I've invested very little and yet b/c it's digital the author still gets dough. A win-win.
0062197258|5.0|Well written suspense novel. Held my interest from the first page. First time reading anything from this author but it won't be my last. Best book I've read in a long while.
B003R0LBVW|3.0|Grade: C+<br /><br />L/C Ratio: 90/10<br />(This means I estimate the author devoted 90% of his effort to creating a literary work of art and 10% of his effort to creating a commercial bestseller.)<br /><br />Thematic Breakdown:<br />35% - Depression<br />25% - Dysfunctional family life<br />25% - Love and affairs<br />15% - Politics<br /><br />With The Corrections, Franzen somehow made reading about depressed people a fun experience. Freedom is just as readable and contains the same extreme level of character depth, but it's lacking a necessary flair. On second thought, maybe it's there but just muted, due to the fact that this novel feels more like a reboot of The Corrections rather than a fresh story.<br /><br />The book's humor is spread thin and at times, especially when the topics of politics and environmentalism are introduced, Franzen's dialogue comes off as completely unnatural. The author's most curious decision is to frame the first half of the novel as one character's autobiography. It's an unnecessary gimmick, especially because the voice of the text is so clearly Franzen's, not the character who is supposedly writing it.<br /><br />The consistent pace of Freedom makes its daunting size quite bearable, but that led me to a question: is crafting deep characters much of an accomplishment when it takes you 600 pages to do so? I'd argue that Jeffrey Eugenides does it just as well in The Marriage Plot, and it took him 200 less pages.<br /><br />Noteworthy Quote:<br />\\"You were working in a soup kitchen. Your dad took me down to see you there.\\"<br />\\"Right, my résumé-building years. I had about seventeen extracurricular activities. I was like Mother Teresa on speed.\\"

B003YFIUW8|4.0|Grade: B<br /><br />L/C Ratio: 30/70<br />(This means I estimate the author devoted 30% of her effort to creating a literary work of art and 70% of her effort to creating a commercial bestseller.)<br /><br />Thematic Breakdown:<br />40% - Psychology of kidnapping<br />30% - Parental bonds<br />30% - Childhood development<br /><br />I am not a parent, but I trust that Room provides an accurate depiction of what an adventure it is to raise a curious, energetic, and sometimes flat-out annoying child. Donoghue took a big risk in making a five-year old boy the narrator and chief character in an adult novel, and it pays off tremendously as long as you, the reader, go into the book with a certain level of patience.<br /><br />Outside of the narration situation, my biggest concern when I started reading Room was what kind of pacing to expect. To my delight, the description of the main characters' daily routine is kept rather short, and then the plot takes hold and drives the rest of the story. The middle third of the novel is practically a thriller and sets up for a powerful and emotional conclusion.<br /><br />Noteworthy Quote:<br />\\"This must be the most tiring week of your life,\\" she says, sitting down beside me.<br />I blink at her. \\"Why?\\"<br />\\"Well, everything's strange, because you're like a visitor from another planet, aren't you?\\"<br />I shake my head. \\"We're not visitors, Ma says we have to stay forever till we're dead.\\"

B00338QF0U|2.0|Grade: D+<br /><br />L/C Ratio: 60/40<br />(This means I estimate the author devoted 60% of his effort to creating a literary work of art and 40% of his effort to creating a commercial bestseller.)<br /><br />Thematic Breakdown:<br />35% - Escape from society<br />30% - Drug company drama<br />20% - Tour of London<br />15% - Intimate relationships<br /><br />Boyd's novel begins with an intriguing bang. The main character, Adam Kindred, meets a stranger in a London restaurant and hours later gets wrongly accused of murdering the man.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the premise reaches its peak in the opening chapters and then quickly falls flat. The author does an adequate job of describing Adam's decision-making process, but it doesn't make the character's decisions any less baffling. Rather than going straight to the police to claim his innocence, Adam opts to throw away his successful career and become a bearded, homeless recluse on the run from the authorities. While this scenario helps to push the plot along and introduce some fun characters, its absurdity hurts the rest of the novel's execution.<br /><br />More generally, Boyd struggles with his genre focus in Ordinary Thunderstorms. The author eliminates every shred of suspense in this supposed mystery by jumping between character perspectives and shoving too much information at the reader. I'm sure the goal was to craft some sort of literary thriller, but all Boyd delivers is a muddled plot that fizzles out well before its tedious conclusion.<br /><br />Noteworthy Quote:<br />It was a routine, now, and one should never underestimate the importance of routine in a person's life: routine allowed everything else to seem more exciting and impromptu.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I didn't think any game would captivate me better than the original Angry Birds, but Rio definitely has! Plus, after a while, those stupid pigs get annoying!  But, then again, the laugh of those monkeys can be quite annoying...they have an almost human sound and it's a bit creepy!
B008EEWN6I|4.0|For fans of System of a Down you'll be happy to know that Harakiri gets back to Serj's heavier side. There's less string instrument and chorus singers than his previous solo albums giving Harakiri a more standard rock/metal sound. That extra twist of strange that sets Serj's work apart is still there though, along with his world views of course. All in all, I thought this was a great albums.
B006YMLE7G|5.0|This movie is great all around; animation, music, characters, and voice-acting are all strong.  The plot is easier to follow and less WTF compared to other, perhaps grittier, anime.  At the same time the story doesn't push any boundaries.  I was torn between giving this 4 or 5 stars because of this.  I decided to give it a full 5, though, because the style is amazing and the movie is extremely well-executed.  Watch it if you are looking for something fun and stylish on a Friday night.

B005FISBTO|5.0|Just watched the whole season this weekend and I loved it as I have loved each season.  It never fails to throw you for a loop as soon as you think you know what's going on.  This season is no different.  Is it my favorite season?  To hard to say after just watching it but I can say I can't understand any fans of Dexter, which you pretty much would be if your buying Season 6, not enjoying it.  This is a show that I love with actors that are great and writing that is always edge of your seat and smart.  I love each season and can't understand anyone giving this season lower than a 4 out of 5 ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of the show.  You pretty much know what you are in for.<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend it and would say if your in no hurry to buy it, definitely wait until it goes down to $24.99 which is what I got it at the day before it came off pre-order.  I'm glad I bought it when I did as I see just a couple days later it's back up to $37!<br /><br />Bottom line, if you like Dexter, you will like season 6!<br /><br />******IF YOU PREORDERED IT AND THEY CHARGED YOU $37.86 WHICH IS WHAT IT WAS FOR SINCE IT WAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR PREORDER, CALL AND TELL THEM YOU WANT A REFUND AND THE PRICE SHOULD BE $24.99 AS WHEN I ORDERED IT, IT WAS STILL ON PREORDER AND HAD DROPPED TO $24.99 LITERALLY THE DAY BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED*******
B00164GDD2|3.0|I gave this generous 3 stars only because it is a fantastic, classic movie. Any other movie I would have given it a one star for a lousy video transfer. What some folks are calling grain, I would call noise.  Grain/video noise and washed out colors through out the movie, enough that it distracts and takes away from the movie watching experience.  The sharpness isnt too bad but is hindered by the noise.  If you have this movie already on DVD you may want to pass.

B0083GPDBO|3.0|The story took too long to develop. I only gave it 3 stars because of the last 15 minutes. Akira did a MUCH BETTER job with its story based along the same theme.
B007SGM084|3.0|I enjoyed the gist of the trilogy, it was a great departure from reality... wonderful sex. I never thought I would say these words; but the sex got boring, I found my mine wandering elsewhere, wondering what happened to the other characters!! This could have been condensed to one book.

0307454568|5.0|After reading the first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I was eager to read the second and third.  When I got this one, I didn't know it was the third, but I didn't notice.  It just felt like it took up from where the first one ended.<br /><br />The complexity of the worlds of politics, crime, sexual abuse, psychology, medicine, police, institutions, economics, and all sorts of evil goings-on was difficult to keep up with, but I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I got a lot more information about Lisbeth Salander that was missing from the first book, and I liked the main characters just as much, plus some new ones who were great.<br /><br />The so-called passionate relationship between the main male reporter/writer and an almost masculine female athletic former cop turned security guard was unbelievable to me, and<br />I liked Blomkvist's long-time married lover much more.<br /><br />The book contains descriptions of female warriors, whom Larssen seems to admire.  He is actually the ultimate feminist, with good male characters, too.<br /><br />Mr. Larssen was an expert in dramatically tense scenes of potential violence; women with strong brains, bodies, and minds; and resolving situations in satisfying ways. This story has one of the best courtroom scenes I've ever read, and when the evildoers get caught in their lies, it goes just the way you want it to ... this would make a seriously good movie.<br /><br />An interesting detail in Larssen's writing is that he often describes what both female and male characters are wearing, and this helps the reader see them more vividly.<br /><br />My only objection is the choppy writing style, kind of like, \\"See Jane walk. But see John hop. Because he can. And she can.  And they like it,\\" instead of, \\"See Jane walk and John hop, because they can and they like it.\\"<br />In other words, too many chopped up sentences without the smooth transitions provided by commas.  However, it was not troublesome enough for me to stop reading.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like an excellent translation from Swedish.  The only thing<br />I would add is a pronunciation guide for all the Swedish names, which I mostly had to just pass over in my mind, not knowing how to say them.p reading.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like an excellent translation from Swedish.

No person can consider himself or herself well educated without a clear knowledge of Lucretius.  The number and importance of people from the past who read Lucretius truly boggles the mind.  How can one not know about him?

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I read this book so I could have an insight into what all the fuss is about.... I could'nt even finish it as it is so badly written... and I love reading erotica. The only positive outcome from this trash being made so widely acceptable is that hopefully people will now explore this genre from not behind closed doors.
0375842209|5.0|Honesty is a very attractive thing; atleast to most of us. If its got a tinge of a child like innocence to it, then it would be even more heart warming. But I doubt how many of us would really be able to accept this book right from the start, considering its quirky and weird writing style and presentation.That is why I couldnt digest it in the begin; but the more I read, the more I got to realize that it was not crazy but honest writing with a beautiful application of words and a spectacular gamut of emotions.<br /><br />The author gives us another view of the Nazi Germany.<br /><br />\\"Of course, I'm being rude. I'm spoiling the ending, not only of the entire book, but of this particular piece of it. I have given you two events in advance, because I don't have much interest in building mystery. Mystery bores me. It chores me. I know what happens and so do you. It's the machinations that wheel us there that aggravate, perplex, interest, and astound me. There are many things to think of. There is much story.\\"<br />This quote needs to be essentially mentioned here because that was how the book was written.<br />The book is narrated by Death that gives insight into the life of a little girl ,Liesel Meminger living in Nazi Germany with her foster parents. Liesel's brother died in the train journey during their travel to meet their foster parents with their mother.And it was on that day that Liesel successfully attempted her first act of thievery; which later on develops to an extend of casual flicking of books from the mayor's wife's library, for whom her foster mother had worked for. Her first book being 'The Gravedigger's Manual' which was partially hidden in the snow, was noticed when she attended to her brother's funeral.It was a life changing moment where her love for words begin to get recognised which eventually shapes up with the help of her accordion playing foster father and a hidden jew at the basement of her new home, who prepares two books for her during hisstay as a refuge in their basement.<br /><br />In this novel, the writer strokes the Death narrator with human emotions.Death narrates the story in a very unusual way often referring to states of mind like anxiety, from a dictionary quoted meaning;explaining what the character is going through at that moment.. It also gives out the end of a particular incident from the start and then brings out the story as to how it ended up as stated.<br /><br />\\"I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\\"<br /><br />This book gifts you magical moments which tug at your heart strings. One such moment was when Liesel had quoted the above , introspecting about how a man (Hitler) ended up dragging a whole world into war, all by the power of words.<br /><br />It was a strong and rich experience. It had a powerful usage of words, thought provoking, insightful where such a gross topic could be handled with such wonderful finesse, it almost reminded me of  'The Diary of Anne Frank'.<br /><br />It was an avant-garde yet soulful experience, indeed!! And trust me, those words were not used in a casual manner.
B008602KQI|3.0|I am a huge fan of the book and the other two books in the series.  I am pretty disappointed in the movie because they left out a lot of the important things in the book.  For example, Cinna doesn't give Katniss the Mockingjay pin, Madge does.  The movie completely leaves out the relationship between Katniss and Madge. The scene where Peeta throws Katniss the bread is also all wrong - they were young kids in the book, not the ages they are now.  The movie also skips all the parts about Katniss' love of the food at the Capital and her favorite lamb dish.  Katniss and Peeta don't get the lamb stew sent to them in the cave toward the end.  Overall, I just felt that the movie lacked some of the key details that were important to the story.  I hope the next movie follows the book more closely.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Very poorly written, totally implausible plot, possibly titillating to 20 year olds (although far better erotica is available free on the internet), but so lacking in any subtlety as to be puerile. Characters are most unlikeable with few redeeming features. I cannot think why it would be called 'Mummy porn'. It is centred on drama, dressed up as glamour with money no object, flashy toys, no genuine love, affection, empathy but with staged power plays. Do not waste your money on this.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|To start off with, I am a PROFESSIONAL VOICE ARTIST since more than a decade or so (12 years to be precise)... going through umpteen number of recordings day after day at different studios ... All of them usually have their own set of \\"preferred\\" headphones ... I wanted a \\"really nice & professional\\" headphone for carrying around with me, as well as, for my personal use, since I've now made a small recording set up of my own as well ... A lot of research for the right phones for a couple of months, the reviews about so many of them, a visit to the local shop to try out a few reputed ones... and finally going with my gut feeling about these ... And i'm glad I chose them... The delivery experience was butter smooth ...well packaged parcel, before time delivery ... and once I opened the box, it was then that the real magic would start ... Really a comfortable grip ... nothing so tight as to make me have a headache, and no falling around stuff either ... Very balanced cushiony texture ... excellent noise isolation ...  AMAZING SOUND AND VOLUME ... especially evident after having worn about 100 odd different branded headphones in the last 10 years or so ...  But these I must say, are going to be a part of my own studio for ever now,  at least until I'm able to find a better pair... If you can go by word of mouth, go for them ... Cheers !!

0307477479|4.0|\\"Time's a goon, right? You gonna let that goon push you around?\\"<br /><br />For the characters in A Visit from the Goon Squad, the answers vary. Some age into dissipation, while others seek and find redemption. They all cope with the passage of time in their own way. Each has a story, told in a variety of styles, which makes the form of the novel a series of short stories. The stories are linked, not only by characters who pass through each others' lives, but most importantly by an axis of popular culture, around which they all revolve.<br /><br />It's the way they relate to popular culture that ultimately distinguishes each character. They feed off of it for what they crave and use it as a yardstick by which they measure their achievements. In the end though, it's not what they get or contribute to the culture that matters, rather it's what they get or contribute to each other.

B001EC2IXK|3.0|It's hard not to like the subject matter of this movie, and I've enjoyed the movie immensely over the years, but recently I've begun to understand the film in a new and less flattering way.<br /><br />Paul Newman, who was simply one good looking fellow, plays the part of an aimless war veteran who finds himself doing two years on a chain-gang (road work) as sentence for destroying public property. The release year of this film reflects it's content - Hollywood was busy pushing aside film heroes like Jimmy Stewart who reflected and performed to traditional American values, and instead was promoting the anti-hero; for example, James Dean.<br /><br />Dialogue in this film when Newman's character, Luke, is conversing with his mother is a mishmash best understood as the screenwriter trapped between the wish to throw old conventions aside, and his fear that going too far would alienate the paying public.<br /><br />This film is leftism trying to emerge from the shellacking it took when The American Way emerged triumphant from World War II. Vietnam and Nixon's resignation would provide all the cover leftist needed to fully emerge out from under their rocks. I've come to understand now that much of Newman's career was employed in posing as the palatable anti-hero for a nation not yet ready to embrace that which is vile without excuse or embarrassment.
B005IZLPME|3.0|Not much 3d in this one. The movie itself is ok but I was more interested in seeing it in 3d. The effect is light and nothing \\"jumps\\" out at you.

0345803485|4.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]This is certainly an interesting book and full of contrasting and enigmatic twists and turns. No matter how the story is twisted and turned at the end of the day, it is a very delicate but strange love story. The story starts with a young virgin,Anastasia Steele, losing her virginity under somewhat strange circumstances for the innocent and sensitive young girl that she is; and at the hands of the strange and enigmatic, but mesmerising, Christian Grey. Most virgins that I know of will find the deflowering experience painful physically and immemorable. Strangely she climaxes on it and thoroughly enjoys the experience. In spite of the strange contract that is offered to her for her to be Christian's sub and for him to be the dom in a BDSM relationship, she holds her own in the relationship as long as she is not in the red room where she can be tied up and rendered helpless and punished if she so much as disobeys Christian. I did not enjoy the description of the sex and love making as I find the circumstances and the descriptions somewhat contrived and amateurish. But I thoroughly enjoyed the conversations that Anastasia has with her conscience and her inner goddess as it shows the sensitivity of the love she has for Christian. The enigmatic, handsome and mesmerising Christian is again larger than life and somewhat contrived in the way he talks and behaves. I cannot relate to him as a man in any way. A totally screwed up behaviour for a real man that is in love, I cannot see any man behaving like him in real life towards the woman he loves. Nevertheless, I intuitive think that most women will like the romanticism and the power of his character when mixed with his obvious charisma and attractiveness to woman. I strongly recommend this novel more for the woman in you. I do not think that most men will be able to relate to Christian as a man and hence may hate this book. The love story buried inthe novel is poignant and touching and only finally pushes out strongly and acutely when Anastasia walks out on Christian at the end of the book. A fine preparation for, and lead in, to the sequel.
0345803485|5.0|I'm not much for reading unless it gets my interest right off the bat. I've never read erotic novels like this and was curious. And boy I am glad I did. Not only was it erotic but it was romantic and wonderfully fantasizing. It was easy to read and follow. I got so caught up this the details and wish I was in Anastasia's place. Just the idea of having the ultimate fantasy life would amazing. I just got done reading the first book and can't wait to read the other two. It would be awesome if it turned into a movie.
B00785P2QC|1.0|A great time if you like games that require you to spam your Facebook or pay money to advance.  I'd gladly pay for a version of the game that is actually playable.  I downloaded this because I enjoy the Virtual City games, but this is not quite what I expected.  The game play is almost the same, just slowed down exponentially and it adopts the two currency system, which makes progressing in the game ridiculously slow unless you want to announce every achievement on Facebook (or of course you can purchase in-game money with your credit card). In fact, if you're not the type to sync all your games to Facebook, don't download this game, since that's one of the only effective ways of earning what you need to build your city.<br /><br />So yeah, it not it asks you for money constantly, but it just plain stinks.

Not only was this book motivational to make something of yourself, it was also a story about love, faith, drive, determination and change. I was inspired by the true heroism Adam Brown displayed as he overcame his dark days. His wife stuck by him unlike any other person would have. Through love and faith, this man made a legend of himself, his family and all of our US military. I highly recommend picking up this book and expect to be moved for days after finishing.

0345803485|2.0|Honestly, I was expecting more out of this book for it being something so popular.  I know how it got on the NYT best seller's list, because this book gets a lot of word of mouth publicity for being so \\"great\\" a love story.<br /><br />I'll cut to the chase: This book is a porno for people that really don't read much. It reads like you're watching a porno in first person. They have sex any and everywhere and for no reason. There's little plot to 50 Shades,and it really feels like said plot or lack there of is just something to get the characters to the next spot to have sex at. The plot is not the focus, the sex is and frankly, said sex isn't very erotic and reading through the elongated sex scenes was a chore and a bore.<br /><br />My biggest issue with 50 Shades of Brown is the fact that the two main characters are suffering from a severe case of \\" The plot says I love you.\\" Where you literally can imagine the characters sitting in chairs with their names on the back and reading glasses, with a copy of the script in hand reading their stiff and cheesy lines, because there is no way in the 7 hells that these two would ever in a million years find love with one another other than because the plot says so. I don't see how he can find her \\"so beautiful, so intriguing, so this. . .so that. . . so everything\\" when I want to back over her slowly with a backhoe.<br /><br />Ana is so annoyingly bland. Christian who has the most potential to be a deep or interesting character keeps getting nerf'd because Ana is too fragile, and any chance Ana gets to develop gets nerf'd by Christian getting angry and her fear of his anger. The author had the chance to make her a stronger willed character each time Ana sought answers for her own peace of mind, and yet instead would always have Ana back down getting scared of him leaving her, etc.<br /><br />Instead she's a timid girl, that has to rely on alcohol for any sort of courage, and has a \\"subconscious\\" and \\"inner goddess\\" that play the librarian and the slut respectively on her shoulders, whom she actually argues with on occasion.  I don't like the fact that the author has over personified Ana's subconscious and inner goddess, using them to do all of the rationalizing and thinking for Ana instead of having Ana herself do the thinking and rationalizing. This yet again robs Ana of any kind of depth, because the author doesn't make the effort to make sure the reader knows that those are actually Ana's thoughts, not two separate characters dancing on her shoulders, that never really seem to influence much of anything. Their thoughts seem completely separate from Ana's thoughts and actions thus keeping Ana bland as watery oatmeal.<br /><br />The book is very repetitive too. Lip biting, foil packets (*cringe*), eye rolling, jeez, flushing/ blushing, half smiling, breath hitches, and the fact that he has gray eyes, I get it. . . His eyes are gray, shut the eff up!!! Dx  I am still trying to figure out: 1) how lip biting looks sexy rather than derrr. :B and 2) how she doesn't have some kind of spot rubbed raw on her lips from biting them so much.<br /><br />That brings me to one more thing. Ana is more like a clumsy super sheltered teenager,than a young woman graduating college. I also despise her way of talking, the eye rolling, and the sheltered childish behavior. How she must always say someone's name. \\"Katherine Kavanah!!!! Christian Grey.\\" ugh. . . I wanted to choke her. She is beyond annoying for a female lead, especially one that I'm supposed to identify with and pretend that she represents me. I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't use or even touch the bristles of the still wet toothbrush of a man that I've known for less than a week that not even 20 minutes ago says that he has something to tell me that will send me away screaming in terror, or be in awe that my menstrual blood is on his junk because he just stalked me cross country had sex with me to change the subject from issues.<br /><br />Everything between the characters love wise, seems forced. Anastasia would have been a much better side character, and her stereotypical goddess Aphrodite bestie Katherine would have made this book an interesting read for sure, because the Author forces Ana to be the \\"I like wearing t-shirts and converse, because I am so plain and clumsy that there is nothing special about me at all. I'm not pretty, I'm plain, and that makes me a scrawny creepy little fugly duck that so many men see as a swan. I don't even own any dressy clothes,I'm so plain. I have to borrow them from somebody else, and I'm beyond naive to boot.\\" kind of character, and she is not allowed to develop beyond that. EVER.<br /><br />I didn't like this book at all. I didn't put it down because there just was enough going on in the story that made me want to keep reading because it had a lot of questions that I wanted answers to, but I can safely say that I'm not interested in going any further into this series unless I am bored and want to just read something bad for the heck of it.<br /><br />For future novels E.L. James, you need a beta reader that will give it to you straight about what could be fixed. Lastly, \\"down there\\" is not acceptable terminology for the genital region :/ I'm sorry, but it isn't. It makes the narrator sound like a child, not an adult. Same thing for \\"foil packets\\" just say he takes a CONDOM. At least that way I don't hear crinkling foil in my ears every time I read the word.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|By far the best of the series so far, and able to literally produce scenes of jaw dropping action, Martin turns the whole narrative on it's head, and does things with and to characters that left me both speechless, and shocked. Already I'm chomping at the bit to see how HBO will shoot some of the more memorable scenes, and can't wait to see all my friends faces who aren't reading the series when they see what happens. A game changer in the series, and sadly probably the highpoint of the series as a whole.

B008ASLNN2|5.0|This movie is better than the critical reviews. Everything, as it was made to be, is first rate: Imagery, dialogue, pace: The characters. The actors. The story. There are no slow spots. And there is a real feeling, a european sensibility, for the complexity of the then new world of the machine and of mass production. This is the second of two Robert Downey Sherlock Holmes movies. The first is just as good if not better.

Not ever having experienced such trauma, so please excuse my lack of compassion (for the lack of a better word), but I wanted more fight in her. She gave up - at first. The book and story became more gripping when, at last, she got some fight in her and started actually doing something...anything!<br /><br />Well written although I could have done without the constant use of the 'f' word every other sentence and page. I'll definitely buy another book by this author.
0843189673|5.0|As mentioned in some other reviews, this set is a hard cardboard folder with 8 paperback Mr. Men books inside. Inside the folder are 8 lighter-weight cardboard sleeves in which the books are stored. It's very cute, and I liked it enough that 2 days after we received our own, I ordered a second one as a gift for a little friend turning 4. It really is perfect to give as a gift or starter set. (And at a much better price than buying 8 of the books individually!) Also, of course, we love the books themselves - fun characters, stories, and lessons for young children.<br /><br />All that being said, one thing to know: While my 3-year-old can take the books out of the folder, she cannot easily put them back in. (Neither can I, for that matter.) I ended up taking the books out and putting the folder away for now, so the little sleeves wouldn't get torn up from her trying to cram the books in. But that's completely ok for us - I'll get the folder back out in a few years, and I'm sure it'll be a great keepsake for her later.

B000FC0SIM|5.0|As author of \\"The Writing Code: The Only Writing Guide You Will Ever Need\\" and a longtime teacher of writing, I am always looking for tricks from the masters. King does not disappoint.<br /><br />He operates at two levels. First, he describes his own life as a writer -- how he gets inspired, how he manages his workday, how he edits and modifies his own drafts. (Like many authors, he reveres Strunk and White.)<br /><br />Second, he offers a number of specific tips for developing great stories that rivet the reader from beginning to end. The most important: Focus on character. Writers have long debated what matters most -- character or plot. On one level, it's a silly debate. You can't have one without the other. But on another level, it makes all the difference in the world. If you know your character inside and out -- his looks, tics and twitches, secrets and fears, desires and phobias, friends and enemies -- you will know how he/she responds to different crises. A character's action derives from his mind, his imagination, what he thinks is possible and impossible in a given situation. So when you know character, you can determine all the turns of the plot.<br /><br />King, of course, is best known for his horror stories. How he dreams this stuff up is at once simple and beyond description. I think of King as a curator of our psyche's dungeon. He gathers scraps of inspiration by experiencing life to the fullest . . . and then pushing his experiences and observations into his deepest, darkest  levels of fear and insecurity. Understanding how he does this is worth the price of the book, and then some.
1878424319|2.0|The book starts off with interesting anticipation but never fully developes the self improving or self intraspectional momentum I had been told that it would.  Perhaps someone in the early stages of spiritual development may identify with the repeatative brow beating, but I for one found it annoying.  There are glimpses and flashes of note worthy insights but they are barried in the mirkiness of metaphor and superstition. Two stars.

SONGS LIKE GIVE ME YOUR SOUL, PICTURES IN RED, AND COLD AS ICE WILL LEAVE YOU WITH YOUR JAW HANGING OPEN AND GIVING YOU THAT \\"I FEEL SOMEONE STARING AT ME FROM BEHIND\\" FEELING.

I could not put my kindle down, even at night I would say just one more chapter, then at the end of that chapter, I would read just one more chapter.  Man.... did I lose alot of sleep.  They were three fantastic books.  I liked how the author ended one book, and the next book started just like you turned the page and started another chapter, not repeating half the book.  THREE GREAT BOOKS!!!! I wish the Author would continue with more books using the same characters.

B00887490Y|4.0|THE TALL MAN is a social morality play disguised as a thriller disguised as a horror. It takes place in Cold Rock, a Washington mining town that has been devastated by the economy. Most of the citizens are dysfunctional hicks and rednecks who seem content to scrabble among the woods, getting drunk, fighting, or just rocking in front of the diner and watching it all waste away. Everyone, that is, except for Julia (Jessica Biel), the widowed nurse/wife of the town's only doctor (\\"He held this community together,\\" more than one persons says). She is beautiful, poised, and has the determination and grit of a Terminator-era Linda Hamilton as she saves the lives of illegitimate babies in her ramshackle clinic (which used to be a school), or confronts abusive molesters in their trash-strewn front lawns.<br /><br />Big problem with the town: kids are disappearing. No one knows how, but the kidnappings happen so rapidly -- sometimes in broad daylight -- that people have invested the events with a supernatural fear, believing they are done by a shadowy figure that they call The Tall Man. When Julia's own son, David, is kidnapped by the figure, she goes on a relentless pursuit for the child. What follows is a tense and also baffling series of events as the movie yanks one rug after another out from beneath its unsuspecting audience. The movie, in other words, isn't about what you think it's about.<br /><br />It certainly keeps you on your toes. Even seasoned viewers who are good at figuring most movies out will probably need two or three guesses to put their finger on the secret of The Tall Man. In this sense, it keeps the film from feeling stale or too melodramatic, and the story's air of mystery lasts until the final moments. The end result isn't quite as amazing or deep as the preceding events wish it was, but it does offer the audience a sticky philosophical question that may or may not prompt discussion. This question might have been more tantalizing if the film had given us more exposition -- shown us more of the town and its families, both before and after the abductions, as well as given us a clearer sense of Julia's character -- but so much energy is expended on the thrilling start to Act Two, as well as on keeping the audience guessing, that by the time all is revealed, it is done so with an exhausted, nearly half-hearted sigh. In fact -- nearly unforgivably -- the movie delivers its final moralistic question mark directly to the audience three times in a row. The last shot may as well have been a screen shot with the words \\"DISCUSS\\" written on it.<br /><br />It's not done poorly, but the movie doesn't parcel out every answer that it should. It's worth a watch if you're sick of the traditional thriller formula.us more exposition -- shown us more of the town and its families, both before and after the abductions, as well as given us a clearer sense of Julia's character -- but so much energy is expended on the thrilling start to Act Two, as well as on keeping the audience guessing, that by the time all is revealed, it is done so with an exhausted, nearly half-hearted sigh.

My favorite tracks are Magnolia Mountain, Sweet Illusion, Easy Plateau, and Cold Roses. Very much worthwhile purchase and highly recommend whether you are a Ryan Adams fan rounding out collection or new to Adams' music.

B007WYPRHI|4.0|Romeo Must Die looks pretty sharp in HD.  Good blacks, colors, lighting, and good sharpness and texture.  It's always been a pretty good looking DVD so I expected no less from the Blu Ray.  It's a nice effort for an under-rated catalogue title that doesn't even have an image on here (what's up with that?)  The audio is top notch for a hip-op oriented track with good surrounds for the action and fight scenes.  I love the end fight with the fire all around them.  Great stuff!  Extras are the same as the DVD so nothing new, except the \\"Try Again\\" music video looks a little sharper upscaled.<br /><br />Not bad for a DVD upgrade.  Like I said, the DVD looked really good, but I needed me some HD Jet Li to get me jazzed up for Expendables 2 this weekend so this Blu-Ray did not dissapoint!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I've heard references to \\"The Hunger Games\\" for some time now, and as I pay little to no attention to pop culture phenomenons, I ignored this one till my husband rented the movie on Amazon on Saturday night. The movie intrigued me enough to check out the digital sample, and I followed that up by buying each installment of the trilogy.<br /><br />The premise is the struggle between a decadent, corrupt city-state ruling over the unwashed masses with an iron fist, and the strongly individualist protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. She's a 16 year old who unwittingly and unwillingly becomes a national symbol of resistance to the tyrannical central authority. She stumbles into this role when she volunteers to take her younger sister's place in a deadly annual ritual forced upon the populace. This is called the \\"Hunger Games\\", wherein 24 people, one male and female from each of 12 districts, are pitted against each other in a winner takes all struggle to the death for the entertainment of the effete citizens of the Capitol, and the humiliation of those subjugated to them.<br /><br />Both sides of the storyline take their roles to extreme levels, the central authority so cold and calculating that it forces adolescents to murder each other, gruesomely, and celebrates the spectacle, and Katniss taking individualism so far as to appear rather repellantly self-centered and unaware of others, or the bigger picture playing out around her.<br /><br />I'm giving this four stars for several reasons. I liked the premise well enough to pay the $5 it cost on Amazon Kindle, but I'm not a fan of first person narration. While the author pulls the technique itself off, the fact that the person narrating is so frequently confused and/or conflicted about events and her own emotional reactions (or lack thereof) to them detracts from the overall effect.<br />I found myself liking the people who loved Katniss more than I liked Katniss, herself. She couldn't understand why they loved her, and frankly, neither could I. She's almost wholly a creature of impulse, alternately swayed by the impulse for individual survival, and the impulse to do whatever she needs to do in order to live with herself afterward. Regardless, her motivation is selfish. Her only truly unselfish act of sacrifice is when she volunteers to take her sister's place as a player in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Her final act in the Game is another impulse decision, an act which unexpectedly proves to be the catalyst for a long-simmering rebellion against the Capitol. The David vs. Goliath struggle foreshadowed throughout the first book led me to purchase the rest of the books in the trilogy, mostly to see how the rebellion would play out.<br /><br />On reading back over this, I can see how my overall impression of Katniss, formed after having read all three books in the past day and a half, has colored her more harshly than a reading of the first one alone would have done. I rated it three stars originally, and upon thought increased it to four stars for this installment of the set., neither could I.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|My daughter is reading this book and enjoyed it.  I am an avid reader of different genres including forms of fantasy.  This book however was a bit of a disappointment.  I found it long and slow in many aspects.  When the interesting more action oriented passages came up, the read was both engaging and rewarding.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Love this game, I just wish you could get hints more often.  Tip: don't play before you go to bed, you may never stop.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game the graphics are awesome  especially on the kindle fire. It is always fun to play any time I love it.
B003204MQS|2.0|I love a good scary movie that creates tension and thrill from creative means rather than simply relying on gruesome and over the top gore.  Paranormal Activity made an honest attempt, but even alone in the dark the scariest part of the movie was when I ran out of beer.  The plot unfolds in a predictable manner with an escalation of \\"paranormal activity\\" until the climax of the movie.  There is even a convenient sound effect (a low base rumble or something) that tells you when to pay attention because something is about to happen. Bottom line I've scooped scarier things out of my cat's litter box...

B007IXWL2C|2.0|Okay I can't lie, I did read all 3 books... so I can't give it 1 star.  There was clearly SOME interest... but mainly because I am interested to see the movie.  This is a complete rip off of Twilight.  The character traits are totally screaming from Twilight.  Okay okay, yeah this is a lot more sexually explicit, but come on... a brooding, extremely rich, hot, mysterious guy?  Doesn't that sound familiar (cough Edward Cullen)??  And a girl who described as pale faced, clutzy, quiet, smart, socially awkward, yet still beautiful, and \\"everyone-is-in-love-with-but-she-doesn't-know-it\\".. oh and parents are divorced?  hmmm Bella? Is that you?  That was such a joke... and not original.  If you are into reading crappy books and just want to read the same sex scenes over and over again... this is the book for you.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This game is wonderful,  clear interface, not much ads and I can play again other player or just play with the computer(tablet in this case).<br />I can win in the easy mode but increasing difficulty is great for advanced players.<br />Thanks a lot for this brillant app .
B000SEI618|3.0|A middle-aged man loses his wife to cancer. Saddened but not distraught, he returns to the village by the sea where his family spent their holidays when he was a child to deal with his loss. He reminisces in the form of this book.<br /><br />This is a difficult book to assess. First, it must be said that the author is a true craftsman. Sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph will leave you smiling and frequently in awe. The only \\"modern\\" book that I have read in my lifetime with comparable prose was \\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\\" by John Fowles lo those many years ago. His vocabulary and sentence structure suggest that every word was carefully selected and the sentence constructed with great care; it is impossible to believe that these words just flowed effortlessly. The problem, if that is the word, is that after a time the actual story begins to wear on you; it becomes overly pedantic. The protagonist is a man given to introspection not action. It's a bit like the fine film \\"My Dinner with Andre\\" only longer. The bottom line; if you are plot driven the story may become mundane. If you can be satisfied reading prose that comes close to being other-worldly, then by all means read it. In reflecting on my own thoughts, I'll probably read a mystery or two and then sit down with another of Mr. Banville's books because the prose is too special to leave alone.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Got as FAOTD. My kids love it. The few times I have pried it from them I found I agree with them.

B003XE3HD2|5.0|I have been wearing Mary Jane Crocs for years, and have three pairs of the original version, all of which are great for the garden, but are too worn for looking stylish at the Farmer's Market. I wanted another pair, but was unable to find any in my size, and (reluctantly) decided to try the newer \\"Shayna\\" Mary Jane. I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />The new Crocs are even cuter than the original style, with a sleeker look that is still plenty roomy and very comfortable. In fact, the arch support of the Shayna is better. I chose the Aegean blue which is very true to the product photo online. I love it!
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|This book attends exactly topic, I'd been searching for: the relationship between physical, scientific and spiritual.  Very clear style, easy to grasp even for non-science fans.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The game is fun and great for releasing anger. The monsters are challenging. Though to beat the first boss you usually need to upgrade your stuff. The fairies are expensive and upgrades take a bit. But;overall it is fun especially for lovers of level up.

1449415881|5.0|Dilbert is always apropos.  There are four of us in our family and every Christmas I buy us each a desktop calendar-- four different ones.  One lucky person gets the Dilbert one.  Everyone else tries to trade.  The person who got Dilbert is instructed to save the pages and pass them around to the rest of us.  I suppose I could give multiples next time.<br /><br />The only complaint about these calendars is the plastic stand.  The easel back is quite flimsy and often collapses as I move it on my desk.  The easel company must have a pointy haired boss or maybe a Wally is in charge of the stand design.
B004G6009K|5.0|I have seen this movie over 100to times now. We've already gone through 2 DVDs. My daughter bought the original DVD for my granddaughter and she watched it so much I bought a backup bluray with regular DVD. We went through both regular DVDs already and the bluray version is acting up so I had to buy this copy to backup that. So when we start watching this set of DVDs I'll have to buy another set. The granddaughter really LOVES this movie. Hopefully now that she's started watching other movies we won't go these so fast.

B007KZY1YY|4.0|I have read the first book \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and proceeding this decided to get the next one which is of course \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\". I am now finished that and am reading \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\". If i am honest i think one of the main reasons for getting the second book in this series was because of how the first book left me wondering if that was it? On saying this i feel the author is quite clever as she keeps you interested enough to continue on to the next book. Anyway i must say the second book \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" has more of a story-line to it which makes a change as the first one in this series i personally felt had very little until near the end. It's still much the same style of writing of course, with the same sort of interactions again and again and again and again and again and again which does get a little bit boring after a while and is very sensationalised which (in real life)could be some what dissapointing for those inexperienced readers(LOL). Now i am onto the last book of this series i feel it is correct for me to say that i wouldn't bother reading a fiction book again as i am only a non-fiction reader. I just find them more interesting and real...the latter what this book sadly lacks(reality). Nothing against the book or the author, as she's obviously clever enough for readers to read all three like me(LOL)! I'm just not used to reading fiction books and found it repetative, boring, unrealalistic and overall not something i would read again. I can tell you this much though...I know that a lot of people rave over this book. My neighbour does. She descibes this book as amazing(I don't understand what part she is referring to??)! She even let her 14/15yr old daughter read all three of the series!! Which bares the thought...Should there be an age restiction??!! The thought of this child reading it disturbs me greatly, and i feel it is wrong on so many levels! However this has nothing to do with me or this review...Overall...Not a bad read. A clever writer, with a great imagination i would say. If this is what you like reading a great one for you. I'm giving it 4 stars for two reasons #1 With series 2 & 3 she has put more thought into an actual story-line and tried to make it more interesting. & #2 I feel she is clever as she keeps it interesting enough at the end of each series to make you want to read the next book. So a 4 star it is. :-)

0553386794|2.0|..<br /><br />Book 1 was pretty interesting, basically focused on 2 families; the Starks of Winterfell and the Lanisters - with a side on the 2 survivors of the previous King's lineage who would factor in later in the battle for the throne. And Daenerys (surviving child of previous King) is very very boring to read about...her stuff could be condensed to fewer and shorter chapters. (She even bored me in season 1 the HBO series based on this book - which by the way is more like watching porn.)<br /><br />By book 3 the focus was less and less on these main characters and more on others. Very obviously in there to add more volumes and not to make the story more interesting. The story seemed to be expanding for the sake of expanding.  As if getting more complicated makes you a better author.<br /><br />I might have stopped after book 3, but since there are only 5 books I went on.  ...it took me FOREVER to get through book 4 (because it just wasn't holding my interest - so much of it was wasted on stuff I didn't care about and missing the characters that I DID care about).<br /><br />Now I'm reading book 5 and a good chunk of it should have been in book 4 because book 4 went PAST this, and now it's taking you back to fill in details.  Stuff you might have wanted to know THEN, but now that you already know what happens the going back for details is just frustrating... and I'm reading in a pissed off mood now wondering why the hell the author didn't just do it in order of events unfolding or leave it out?  It's like someone dropped chapters on the floor and they just picked them up and printed them out of order.  (I think more thought goes into planning the lineup of songs on a CD!)<br /><br />I'm frustrated wondering why he is wasting my time on these other characters and why isn't the story progressing more towards a conclusion - or at least being more interesting in the process?<br /><br />Book is 5 so clearly not even close to the end of the story which had I known this, I would not have begun! (Especially after forcing myself to read the whole dang series by Robert Jordan - which could've/should've easily been half as many volumes!) In books 4 & 5 the story barely advances at all - who knows how many volumes this is going to end up to be to get to the end.  And at $20+ a book it gets expensive to finish a series.<br /><br />I really wish authors wouldn't do this.  They get a story idea that's good for a few books and then make a deal to deliver WAY more volumes which means they have to complicate it with more and more meaningless fluff and sub-stories.  More volumes doesn't make it a better story!!<br /><br />********************************************************<br />BOTTOM LINE on this book series:  DON'T even start this.<br />********************************************************<br /><br />You might want to try reading books by Brandon Sanderson or Terry Goodkind instead. (Goodkind did pretty well with his long series, managing to keep the story moving along - though around book 4 he was constantly catching up readers who perhaps didn't read previous volumes, which gets annoying, so there could've been less volumes, but it was nowhere near as annoying as Jordan and Martin).  Or, for a more modern day fantasy series, I HIGHLY recommend the DRESDEN FILES series - lots of snappy wit in those and good story in each volume.s, I would not have begun!

0525423656|4.0|I thought this was a great sequel to Matched.  Going into to both books I wasnt sure if it would be something I would like as they are not part of my normal reading genre.  But I am so glad I read them.  And I cant wait for the next book.<br /><br />In this one we have the same characters but they exhibit more of their strengths and you really get to watch them grow and face this new world they are living in.  They learn how to choose for themselves what they believe is right and wrong and make their own decisions.<br /><br />Cassia is who we see the most in this story and therefore really has the biggest change and I really grew to like the character even more thought it.  I didnt always agree with her choices or reasoning.  But I liked how she was strong enough to stand up to and fight for what she believed and dreamed of.  The challenges she faces along with Ky, are immense compared to what she has faced before and its great to see how well she does and what comes out of it.<br /><br />Ky as a character I still have some issues with.  But Im looking forward to seeing what he becomes in the next book.  And Im really hoping to see more of Xander in the third book as well.<br /><br />This really ended up a stunning novel and one not to be missed.
B003QZ5222|1.0|Purchased 1/23/2012<br />I had no problem with any disc until I just put in Darkness On The Edge of Town. It will not play Period......I tried it on my computer(multiple drives), and a stand alone DVD player. The disc looks fine. Cleaned the disc ..no difference. OOhhh my unhappiness. Waited 5 months to play it. Now Amazon don't even wanna know me.
B004I744AS|5.0|Not only is this a dictionary it is so much more.  And unlike what one other reviewer wrote you CAN take off things you do not want on there for instance the horoscope.  Get this great free app.  Love the extras.
B00338QENI|4.0|Very nicelly told story. I particularlly liked to be in contact with all the effort and creativity it took to finally be able to grow human cells in the lab, and the medical environment at that time for an african-American family to get help.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Got both DVD's for a ridiculously low price of under $8.  Both have been watched and performed just as expected, great deal!
B004J2TPSI|2.0|This transmitter had to be re-paired numerous times. Would not stay paired. The On/Off switch is tiny, and does not have a strong detent, seems flimsy and likely to fail. Finally, the blue indicator light stopped working after a couple of days.
B001LF347E|5.0|\\"Merlin: The Complete First Season\\" is a mystical and uplifting show around the spiritual tests of each character in Merlin.  All the actors contributed in each way towards the outcome of the overall resident well-being in Camelot. Colin Morgan cleverly plays the character of a Merlin who must help King Arthur Pendragon(powerfully played by Bradley James) without revealing the use of magic. John Hurt plays a compelling role of \\"The Great Dragon\\", a being who Merlin secretly consults with for help in magically prevailing over various tests.Richard Wilson plays Gaius, a firm and wise mentor to Merlin. Anthony Head plays the convincing role of Uther Pendragon, a headstrong father to King Arthur who is extremely brutal to those caught practicing magic. However, Head's portrayal of Uther also means well in protecting his son Arthur Pendragon and maintaining a good kingdom for his citizens. Angel Coulby and Katie MCGrath persuasively play the characters of Guinevere and Lady Morgana Pendragon.  I also really enjoyed that the show portrays two female characters that are loyal friends to each other. Additionally, Katie McGrath's Lady Morgana plays an assertive and clairvoyant woman who courageously stands by Angel Coulby's Guinevere character in both happy and adverse times. The first season Merlin dvds contain among the following great bonuses:<br />Behind The Magic (Parts One and Two): All of the characters are covered in their full glory and are shown as down to earth people who just want to contribute towards a meaningful show.<br />Video Diaries divided up by Colin Morgan and Colin, Bradley, plus the Cast: I enjoyed seeing them share what they go through in perfecting various scenes for the series.  It was also great watching all of them having a fun time at a theme park roller coaster.<br />Photo Gallery: There are superb photos of both the key villians and the benevolent characters during the first season.<br />Wallpapers: You have to insert this dvd into your computer, but there are an eclectic assortment of images that one can view for desktop background ideas.<br /> There are 13 episodes divided among 4 dvds, with the fifth dvd  featuring the bonuses and wallpaper. Of course I enjoyed each episode. However, my two overall favorite episodes from the first season are \\"Moment of Truth\\" and \\"The Labyrinth of Gedref\\".  \\"Merlin: The Complete First Season\\" is best for those who enjoy mystical tv shows with spiritual themes.er, but there are an eclectic assortment of images that one can view for desktop background ideas.<br /> There are 13 episodes divided among 4 dvds, with the fifth dvd  featuring the bonuses and wallpaper.

B00632HWOG|3.0|Its a useful app in viewing ur emails, but im unable to open up my old emails and view my spam inbox to view my expected emails :(
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Tripe.. but for some reason the ladies love it.  It's a mystery to me.  Absolutely nothing of substance or interest, except the sex scenes, and even they are pretty dull.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Ive got a four month old baby and whenever she has a problem sleeping, I'd play this and she would quickly get soothed and sleep in her cot. Her fav combination is lullaby, night and chimes! The other thing is that you can compose ur own music for different ambiences and add them to ur favouites list! The only disadvantage is that I could not (maybe dont know how)  to go back and perform another app or do another task on kindle. Whenever I go back, this app will automatically stop :(
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I was so excited when I saw that I could put it on my kindle fire, but after playing this I found that it was a bit glichy nothing that would make me uninstall it but it is a bit better on ipod
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have to admit, the first part of the book dragged and not a whole lot happened.  From the beginning we know the wife is missing...and the unraveling of events seems very predictable and ho-hum.  You think you have it all figured out.  Part 1 drags... BUT STICK WITH IT!  As the book goes on, you are given new bits of information that leave you thinking \\"Oh!\\" as a light bulb goes off in your head.  By Part 2 of the book, I was thoroughly engrossed and could not put it down.  The book takes you in a completely different direction and you can't even fathom where the author is going with it.  The book begins moving very quickly, and the end of each chapter leaves me dying to know what will happen next. Brilliant!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|yes I have green waiting for this app for a long time I am so happy.  d. d f v x s z s e r r
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I like playing this game. It never gets old. I like to try and beat my previous times. It is not always easy to do!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Each level is a good challenge and files give you cool balloon levels. I love Where's My Perry App :)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|one of the best &quot;one more run games&quot; simple yet addicting. random levels and 6 rides make this one hard to master.
