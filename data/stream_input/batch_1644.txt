B005LAIH4A|5.0|Love this movie! My kids enjoyed it,and so did I. There are some really funny parts,and catchy songs. It's a movie both the parents and kids can enjoy. It also helps the kids understand the importance of trees and wildlife.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I had seen this production on PBS and was very impressed by it.  It was so well done and the 2 leads - Ramin Karimbo and Sierra Boggess were outstanding.  Not only are they wonderful singers but their acting truly brought the story to life.  I was so pleased that the CD included not only the songs but the scenes as well!  The special finale with all the previous Phantoms singing was quite a treat.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves this show.<br /><br />One question though: why wasn't Sarah Brightman's solo included?  Granted her voice is not as strong as it once was but it was peculiar that her solo was not included.
B007T99ENE|1.0|The most disappointing Ian McEwan I have read. Narrative point of view of young woman did not work. Contrived situation, all the cliches of life in the 70s with stilted prose. He is no John le Carre!
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I listen to this almost every day, it is my top choice right now for listening. I wish they would bring out more though.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Having been in the military for a great number of years, I can comprehend this book very well.  I thought it was a fairly easy read and was able to finish it in a relatively short period.  I thought is was a fascinating account of the operation that brought down the most ruthless terrorist of our time.  Also, I was not able to discern any classified information.  I am glad these guys are on our side, great job.
0307744434|3.0|The most mesmerizing aspect of this book is Jim Dale's narration. I bought it specifically because of Jim Dale; had I bought it to read personally, I would have given up on it after a few chapters. There's no flow to the story,the characters stop just short of being compelling, and the plot feels like its all over the place. It can't decide if it's a love story or a battle to the death - it's not successful at both as it's not committed to either outcome. There are numerous comparisons to Harry Potter and Twilight but the difference is that HP as a story arc was committed to a battle between good and evil and it never lost its focus on resolving that battle - friendships and magic and the fantasy were the vehicle. Twilight was always committed to being a love story with vampires and angst and werewolves being its vehicle. The Night Circus never fully commits to its story, doesn't really commit to its magic or fantasy either. So you get what feels like an unfinished work. Jim Dale is committed to being the best narrator and voice actor possible however, and there is some great magic in that. I'd recommend the audio version if you'd really like to dive into this book. Then again, I'd listen to that man read a phone book. If you'd like to hear some of his other work, his readings of all 7 Harry Potter books and Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol are incredible.

0486414124|2.0|This was my classic read for the month....since it was supposed to be funny, I picked it...<br /><br />Although it takes you into the English countryside and shows you the lives of people in this era, the story line was just too contrived and frivolous for me to get into.<br /><br />Jane introduces you into the lives of three women whose lives revolve around taking walks in the countryside and looking for husbands to marry...<br /><br />Jane's later works were so much better!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I really like this album. Variety of songs for a great value.  I would definitely buy smother Maroon 5 album.
0525951652|2.0|The book came in reasonable time... I found \\"Fall Of Giants\\" not as compelling as his \\"Pillars Of The Earth\\" and \\"World with Out End\\", Both, although very similar, I found I couldn't put down.
B0035X1BSO|5.0|A very interesting and entertaining read about the GFC and Lehman brothers history. It's the best book to date that I've read about the financial crash.
B005FISBV2|4.0|We couldn't wait to catch up on the adventures of Dexter and the final scene of the final episode was OUTSTANDING.  We can't wait for the next season to begin.  We had several nights when we would watch\\"Just one more episode\\" and stayed up way too late.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I purchased this book on a Sunday afternoon and by Monday night I was finished. This book is an absolute page turner that balances detail with pace to keep the reader engaged at all times. I will be looking for additional titles from this author. Well done!

B007URVZJ6|4.0|This is an excellent brief guide for the author who wishes to convert manuscripts to the Kindle format. Highly recommended.

It took less than 2 hours work to convert each manuscript following this guide.
B008I3R2VG|4.0|Battle Born begins very strong (\\"Flesh and Bones\\"/\\"Runaways\\") and ends very strong (\\"Be Still\\"/\\"Battle Born\\"), however the middle three songs (\\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\"/\\"The Rising Tide\\"/\\"Heart of a Girl\\") makes the album unlistenable as a whole.  The problem is \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" and \\"Heart of a Girl\\" are very weak, uninspiring ballads.  Furthermore, it causes the ballads to overpower the rockers on the album, leading to many of the criticisms of the album.  By the time the listener gets through the middle three songs, they have likely lost interest and doesn't realize how brilliantly and inspiring the album finishes (if they are still listening at all).  \\"The Rising Tide\\" is actually a pretty good song, however, it doesn't sound like it sandwiched between \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" and \\"Heart of a Girl\\".<br /><br />My solution has been to remove \\"Miss Atomic Girl\\" and \\"Heart of a Girl\\" from the album completely.  Doing this not only removes the two weakest songs on the album, but it also: 1.) creates a much better balance between up-temp and slow-tempo songs; 2.) gives \\"The Rising Tide\\" more a chance to shine and become a good bridge between the first half and second half of the album; and 3.) allows the listener not to lose interest and discover how great the album finishes.<br /><br />Removing \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" and \\"Heart of a Girl\\" has really increased my enjoyment level with the album.  There still may be criticisms that the album  doesn't rock enough, but I believe my proposed changes would quell a lot of the criticisms.<br /><br />Album as is:  3 Stars<br /><br />Album minus \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" and \\"Heart of a Girl:  4 and 1/2 Stars<br /><br />Best Songs:  \\"Flesh and Bones\\", \\"Runaways\\", \\"Deadlines and Commitments\\" (by far the best ballad and biggest grower), \\"Be Still\\", and \\"Battle Born\\"<br /><br />Worst Songs:  \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" and \\"Heart of a Girl\\"
1451626657|5.0|A very smart, well written book. I'm not some pacifist, violence is evil type of drum beater. Sometimes violence is necessary. Far too often, however, even with the best surface intentions, the machine of bureaucratic incompetence enters the fray, and makes everything both surrealistic, and incomprehensible. This book points that out. It doesn't find fault with the ongoing war, per se, just with the way it is run. At the same time, it brings up plenty of intriguing questions. The sharp witted protagonist,Yossarian, time and again points out the futility of trying to argue with any single minded authority figures. Sad, serious, and hilarious, all at the same time. As a side note, I enjoyed this book so much, I tried some more work of Heller's. It was horrible, this one off being his true genius hat trick, and nothing else even coming close.

0930289234|5.0|Simply amazing. I first read this, when it came out, as a 14 year old. It still holds up, and is inspiring, to this day. Alan Moore built a miniature Manhattan, and constructed his story as realistically as he could around it's premises. I'm not a huge Dave Gibbons fan, his work is a little too clean and poppy for my liking, but with this complex of a tale, his precise perspective. light source, and anatomy really shine, and helps enhance the story.<br />The story deals with two very real, and especially at the time, very un-comic like concepts. One is the chaotic, fallible, ever changing real world. the other is the psychological strain inflicted upon you by immense power. People die. Make bad decisions. Commit ghastly crimes. But ultimately, the majority, have an internal sense of what is right (in their perspective) and try to follow it. Which only feeds the chaos, and fallibility, of the real world.<br />I think people always make too much of \\"what the author is trying to say\\". It's a complex story, full of wildly colorful characters, human frailties, and complicated situations. And it's extremely engaging and well told. That is more than enough. Too bad the movie \\"version\\" caught none of this. But that's another story.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|The Lorax was entertaining and funny at the same time being educational about the problems we are facing.  It showed what happens when we forget to respect nature and only think about all the new technology and forget the simple pleasures of nature.  Dr Seuss always did have more to his stories than meets the eye, highly recommend.
B006ZOIZ20|4.0|The first one that I chanced upon in a record store was for \\"Green\\" in the late eighties and from then onwards R.E.M. started releasing deluxe versions of their albums in strange but cool formats.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" came forth in September 1994 as a rock album of songs that could be performed live. Peter Buck calls this one \\"the band's noisy record\\" and it is that and more. Recording for \\"Monster\\" began in Acapulco, Mexico in October 1993 and after many stops in different studios it was finished up in July 1994 in Los Angeles, Ca. Two big things happened over the course of these many months of writing and recording as R.E.M. lost two good friends with the deaths of River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain. The first theme of Michael Stipe's Lyrics was sex and after the tragic loss of their two friends the band focused on the life and mortality as another theme introduced into the music and a blanket of darkness came down and covered eveything underneath.<br /><br />The deluxe version of \\"Monster\\" contains the same twelve songs as found on the original/normal version but now the disc is packaged in a 8 and 3/4\\" by 5 and 7/8\\" silver box with a red spine. A 52 page book presents photographs, cartoons, fractures of lyrics and images in an pure art school fashion that is also seen in the videos produced by the band to showcase their music.<br /><br />This music should be played with your woofers trying to bust outta your speakers to achieve the effect that R.E.M. had in mind for \\"Monster\\" as this is a LOUD rock record of both loss and hope. It all begins with the fuzzbox and wah wah of: \\"What's The Frequency Kenneth?\\" to the glam rock of: \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\" to the buzzing riff of: \\"King Of Comedy\\" to bluesy: \\"I Don't Sleep, I Dream\\" to the manic: \\"Star 69\\" to a romantic ballad: \\"Strange Currencies\\" to some really strange drums found in: \\"Tongue\\" to the menace and sex of: \\"Bang & Blame\\" to Rolling Stones soundalike: \\" I Took Your Name\\" to a farewell for Kurt entitled: \\"Let Me In' to an animal boy romper stomper: \\"Circus Envy\\" to the back-to-feedback basics of: \\"You\\" that closes out the album.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" is a stand-alone type of album of it's day as a slick pop album of massive success came out two years before it and another big-time pop sounding record would be released a few years after this li'l noise maker screamed at the world. For all the folks that got into R.E.M. in the late eighties/early ninties this record is a cruel mistress to have to deal with and some want to forget that it does indeed exist. Rock ain't pretty and \\"Monster\\" is not pretty as well but, it is honest and real.<br />Four Stars!n' to an animal boy romper stomper: \\"Circus Envy\\" to the back-to-feedback basics of: \\"You\\" that closes out the album.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" is a stand-alone type of album of it's day as a slick pop album of massive success came out two years before it and another big-time pop sounding record would be released a few years after this li'l noise maker screamed at the world.

1439107955|4.0|Mukherjee's book is not an easy read; while the descriptions of individual patients flow well and held my interest, I found it difficult to follow all the very technical medical discussions.  However,overall, I am glad I read it.  I learned that CANCER is so much more complex than any one disease; I also learned that while we have not found a magical \\"cure\\" for cancer - huge advances have been made. . .also it's important to distinguish between advances in various types of cancer.  I find Mukerjee's work to be inspiring.  I also found the patients he chronicles to be courageous and inspiring.  I'd recommend reading this book - even if the reader goes quickly over some of the detailed descriptions of cell biology, etc.
0515141429|5.0|I was finish reading a Bill Bryson, Walk In The Woods.<br />Very fine book, non fiction.  I was looking for my next read which I searched with the terms such as \\"intelligent\\" or \\"smart\\" and somehow ended up with Lee Child's Jack Reacher series.<br /><br />From the beginning, it hooked me in. How he is assesing his predicament with the fast and vivid analysis in a fraction of second and he's attitude, etc, making Jack a very likable character.<br />He has it all; Sherlock Holmes, Jack Bauer (No pun), etc...<br />In addition, writer's incoporation of Music, reminds me a bit of Murakami Haruki's style who is my favorite author.<br /><br />For one thing, this shouldn't be a bed time read.  It will make you keep reading and compromise your good night sleep.<br /><br />Taken for granted that you've already read the book or willing to sacrifice a bit of spoiler.  A couple of things I didn't liked about the book.<br />Too much coincidence like other reviewer might have said. Love affairs with Roscoe almost stoop it down to the cheesy level, so I Shrugged :)<br /><br />I'm a slow reader, but finished in 3 days and on the next one on the sceries, \\"Die Trying\\", and it have me hooked already!

B008MZPVP4|3.0|Well I was eagerly awaiting Down's new EP and I am a bit dissapointed. I just saw them live for the 4th time this week and as usual it was an amazing show. They played three songs from the new EP, Witchtripper, Open Coffin and Misfortune Teller. They sound much better live than on the EP.<br /><br />The production on the CD sounds lacking and just seems like the songs aren't finished more like a demo. Listening through the CD a couple times I would have to say it is my least favorite Down CD. I am not a music critic but I know Down and I expected better. I hope the next 3 EPs step it up.<br /><br />Anyone that compares this EP to NOLA is nuts.
055358894X|5.0|You HAVE to read this book if you like dark fantasy.  It is humorous, sharp, and the plot is gripping.<br /><br />Lynch is the best writer I've read in fantasy in a long time, and along with Brent Weeks new novel [[ASIN:031607991X The Blinding Knife (Lightbringer)]], \\"Lies\\" stands as a unique fantasy with a strong voice.  These novels are a stark contrast to most efforts being churned out of the fantasy mill now, and Lamora is a character you will simply not be able to stop reading about (go ahead and budget some cash for book 2, because you'll be forced to buy it the second you close the book).

B0089BSM70|5.0|Having seen this film countless times on various formats...the SHOUT! bluray is by far the best quality you are likely to see.  The bluray edition is simply top notch and the picture was cleaned up nicely! Way better than last years Universal edition. I was also thrilled to finally see the TV cut, which does flow differenty from the final cut.  The extras were a fun treat as well!  Highly recommended for all fans of this film.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|take a simple puzzle, add some simple 'traps,' mix it up with some dead ends, spice it up with some new twists and tricks... oh, and then calculate the minimum number of moves one can solve the puzzle with as a goal.  solving the trickier puzzles is a great feeling!  then finding out you used one move too many...! GAH!  but not so 'gah' that you hate it.<br />quell is at the same time relaxing and stimulating.  it's a great game; you'll love it even when it is frustrating you.  because you KNOW you're going to solve it.  there's only a finite number of moves you can do.  the combination is there!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Despite the many negative reviews I bought this book as I wanted to know a little bit about how this raid came about, and to be honest most of the negative reviews seemed to be by people who would be the first to scream for help if half the terrorists in the world landed on their doorstep, but whilst the terrorists are in a different part of the world they feel they have he right to blast a soldier who has put his life ON THE LINE for THEM and those around them.<br />I am ex British Forces, 15 years in, so perhaps I am biased, but I saw absolutely no problems with the contents of the book.<br />No major incredible secrets were revealed and any negative comment about how the head sheds run the wars would be absolutely normal in any barracks anywhere in the world.<br />The people that are slamming this guy for writing this are quite simply, idiots.<br /><br />The book is entertaining and a good read, and 2 years down the line it is hardly telling much that was already not known when published.<br />Also, if a man cannot have freedom of speech in the USA and slag off his bosses then there is something wrong, but then we all know that already I think.<br />Nobody will get killed because he told state secrets that put lives in danger.<br /><br />Also, he states that the majority of the profits will go to charity.<br />And I don't care if he keeps some!!<br />After a long time punishing his body to the point where as he gets older he will really feel it and putting up with the stupidity of legal idiots and people more worried about how the world will see the USA and saying that war has rules on one side but not the other, he and all the others deserve something, don't you think?<br /><br />It is a good book, read it, and to h*ll with the naysayers.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|Not many movies have hit me like this.  A young woman has ruined 4 lives, including her own, and must live with it.<br /><br />Brit Marling is brilliant.  I will be looking for more great things from her.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. It is very addictive. I find a lot of awesome things from kids stuff, to recipes,  to holiday decorations.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I'll make it short.  The blu ray quality is amazing, they don't letterbox the picture with the upper and lower bars, I love that.  Sound is amazing on my surround system.  For the first viewing, I watched it as a straight audio decode, no modifications.  Menus are sharp.  The digital copy is blah, it's not HD, but you can transfer the file to whatever device you want.  I also downloaded the audio soundtrack.  It comes in a zip file and you extract to a folder then import to your music software.  I couldn't figure out the digital comic offer, I never did seem to get that.  It's also got some app you can put on your computer and then play the Blu Ray at the same time, and they sync. Haven't tried that yet. I haven't played all the bonus features on the Blu Ray yet.  Will try that tonight. I'll leave this review open for edit in the future.<br /><br />Overall, I love it and am pleased.
B0053O89YM|4.0|I like this series very much. This time I found it absorbing while I watched but didn't give it much thought afterwards. I like the kids. But they are actually about five years older than their characters, so how much longer can it go on, realistically?<br /><br />The British former consultant to ..... Has been written poorly this time, I thought. First, how did he get to have such a large part in the law firm, so large he is contemplating a take-over? Very little he does is realistic; especially sex. There is no chemistry between him and the very unattractive woman who hovers about him, and professes her lust. Then he reciprocates, but it is totally unbelievable, and his going to bed with her seems just icky. Most of what this actor, who is a very good actor, does in this season seems weakly written and brings the show down.<br /><br />The writers, in the comments, seem in love with their guest women; they laugh. I found them, the ex-wife of the Brit (Parker Posey? I should have refamiliarized myself with everyone's name since I have anomia) and the comedian Sedaris seem to have been inserted in a kind of blinders-on way, the way you might try to palm off stoned, hilarious 'creativity' even after the high wears off. I felt used, that someone's laziness wasted my time during all those too-long bits.<br /><br />The actor who plays Kalinda, like all the actors, is very good. But her fluctuating British posh-not-posh accent is distracting. Sometimes I think some Brits have a very low opinion of Americans' view of British accents -- that they're all the same. But we've seen enough regional British movies that we can almost place some characters' accents within Britain and between classes. Kalinda's fluctuating one is distracting in itself but especially when she effects a more upper-class accent. Then, all I can think of is, 'she's doing that again'. It's perplexing, why this goes on.
030758836X|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time. Keeps you on your toes trying to figure it all out. Some people don't like the end but please keep in mind this is fiction and stop over-analyzing it. Highly recommended!!

B008N5UX9M|4.0|Of course I will get very little support here. But I've just never cared for Iron Maiden. Maiden plays to their fans and there is certainly nothing wrong with that. But I find this to be a refreshing and better alternative. A more mature sound.
B008LAO7C8|5.0|So, the SWANS epic new monster of an album 'the Seer' both met and exceeded expectations.  Definitely a top pick of 2012. I was even silly enough to buy both the 2CD and 3LP versions. No illegal downloading of the album for me!<br /><br />HOWEVER, what I will give a negative review is their 'automated advertising recommendation generator' program.<br /><br />Week after week I have been hit with recommendations of albums which are allegedly like 'the Seer', but are actually not even in the same genre, let alone even close in an approximation of sound and attitude of the SWANS!  Case in point: electronic dance music of the Presets new album 'Pasifica' was recommended as being like the SWANS new album?! I scoff and chuckle with amused indignation with such a ridiculous suggestion...<br /><br />So Amazon, either write a better program or get a 'human' who has a clue to check before automated recommendation emails are sent out.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Disgruntled customer
B007M45PMU|5.0|Bought the albums for one song that I loved, listen to the whole album and totally love it. Well worth the purchase.

B008X8QCTO|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was worth paying another .99 to play.  They probably just should of had the price up front to start with but again worth it.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Not meaning to make this sound overly scientific (mainly because it is art), it is worth noting how these guys have found a special magic within their sound together.  As the follow up to the 2009 album, Babel does a lot to impress the listener.<br /><br />Energy; both vibrant and subtle -<br /><br />Mumford & Sons has took the world by storm using their raw mixture of acoustic melody, percussion, and that catchy little banjo to compliment the ensemble.  Complimentary vocal harmonies just serve as added measure, just in case you had not been won over yet.  What sets Babel apart is the freedom from the market expectation of ALL adrenaline in every arrangement.  The band allows themselves to go quiet at times to paint a picture that is in compliment to what Mumford & Sons has created since their early formation.<br /><br />Something old, something new, and ultimately something comfortable -<br /><br />This album feels familiar, but it allows us to visit some new places as well.  Feed the base, and expand; that's what has been done here.  The word disenfranchise just doesn't become an issue when listening(important part of the formula).  Instead, we see an added dimension to the painting and expansion to its frame.<br /><br />This is a live touring band capturing a set of moments in a studio.  These songs will play well on the road and individually to listeners.  Well done, gentlemen!

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I think I should probably just stop watching movies now that I've seen this.  It is a Profound work of Art that has it all.  It encompasses the entirety of the history of Earth and life, from amoebas to dinosaurs to Sean Penn brooding.  It addresses all the important questions without making the mistake of having a plot or a point.<br /><br />You could watch this movie again and again without being able to make sense of it, again like life.  The high point of Sean Penn's life is masturbating on the neighbor's lingerie as a child, which in itself is a beautiful metaphor for his career and the perfect summary mise en scene to represent this whole beautiful film.<br /><br />Director Terrence Malick has a degree in philosophy from Harvard, so you know that this stuff is Profound.<br /><br />Having seen this movie, I have seen all of the history of life, philosophy and Meaning so thoroughly explicated that there's really nothing else left to see, learn or feel.  I could just kill myself after seeing this movie, for what else is there left to live for?
030726999X|5.0|The Book is great and arrived fast and in perfect conditions! Cheap price for an awesome product!<br />I will buy more books on this system for sure, is a lot better than paying a lot of money for a new book.
0307744434|5.0|This book is unlike anything I have ever read before. The author describes everything with such amazing detail that it pulls you in where you find yourself having a difficult time putting the book down. I normally do not like reading books that skip around a lot, but this one is so cleverly written it made it more enjoyable as you read and the scattered peices of the puzzle come together.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have to admit I am a fan of this series, but this book is the necessary continuation of book 4. there is a lot of setup in the beginning of the book, but it is all necessary in order to tie the series together at the end.
B0058PJ6NE|2.0|the app semes likely the same as freedi youtube downloader but little changes(got to fix the errors) like for example conection errors download errors and force close errors. its  so  dang  anoying  fix  it  now!!!!  what the heak hapend.
034580404X|5.0|Loved it! Secrets twists and turns that leave you wanting more! I really wish there were more than 3 books!
0345803485|2.0|I just bought the book because anything this monumentally bad needs to be read at least once. I'm four chapters in and nothing has happened save the main character gong all googly eyed over \\"Mr. Grey\\". The writing, while bad, is not terrible. Hell, this twilight fanfic is better structured than the source material. I don't care what you twilight moms think, Stephanie Meyer writes exactly like the 14year olds she's writing for and it's tripe.<br />So far, the plot leaves a lot to be desired, as does character development. I haven't gotten to any of the sex scenes yet, but I didn't buy the book because of my interest in BDSM, I bought it because I have a morbid fascination with things that are by definition \\"not good\\".<br />I mean something has to break the heavy reading. Why not this? I just finished \\"farewell to arms\\" by Ernest Hemingway and once I finish 50 shades, I'm going to start reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintanence.<br />Drivel is a good thing sometimes.<br />Am I saying this is a good book? Not by a long shot.<br />What I am saying is, if you can suspend belief long enough to believe that vampires sparkle instead of bursting into flames, you can believe there is a Dom who is a pushover when it comes to his virginal sub.
1933633867|1.0|The book is full of concepts that I can not agree, the author mix the definitions of debt, payment, retribution and so on... do not understand what credit is all about- see essai sur le don (marcel mauss's seminal book). I think there is a lot of prejudice involved in that book. It looks like a book against capitalism and economy as a field of wisdom, but the arguments are  frequently  weak and sometimes distorted. Just to clarify: I am economist, and I have studied  philosophy.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Interesting reading, but too many acronyms and slang creates a lack of continuity. No chest-pounding. Stresses camaraderie and well-coordinated teamwork. Nothing seemed compromising to US security as most of the actual assault was on the news anyway, the planning was nothing 'new'. Kept my interest through the entire book.
B005ETA5K2|2.0|This works. It's cheap. But the signal isn't that strong compared to the Bear Extender products. I have both and the Bear beats it out. It's cheap. lots cheaper than the bear extender. I guess this fits the old adage: \\"you get what you pay for\\".
1932735410|2.0|First, this is simply a reprint of the 6th Edition as the PMBOK 4th edition and the PMI code of conduct did not change.  Second, Rita Mulcahy died in 2010.  This book is, where changed, edited apparently by Laurie Diethelm.
B00976N384|5.0|Think the heart and soul of Springsteen's \\"The River\\" but with the killers music.  This album gets it's hooks in you.  This one is deep, and rich and full of songs that sink in so far.  This is an album that I will wear out.  They just have that badass Nu-80's sound that reminds you of a smarter Cars.  This is not one to pass up!
0425263908|5.0|I read the 50 Shades of Grey  books and luv'd em.  This book was very exciting to read because,  Eva and Giddeon seemed like people with real problems which grabbed my attention and kept me wanting more . Can't wait for Oct 26 =)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Cool book i loved every detail  very good book i would suggest you get it now five stars oh yeah
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app does the job 90% of the time. It has an easy interface and is organized well. It sometimes force closes on me but not often enough for me to get annoyed to the point of uninstalling. Newbies beware. Time will suddenly dissappear while browsing Pinterest. Consider yourself warned.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|While the basic storyline was likeable, the author repeated the same phrases and words too often.  The character of Ana, sounded more like an English exchange student than a girl living in the northwest and raised in the south.  Another problem was the obvious comparison between the characters in the “Twilight“ series.  For more mature readers the character of Christian reminded me of Robin Stone in Jacqueline Susannes, “The Love Machine,“ complete to the psychological struggle that both Christian/Robin faced by their dead whore/mothers.  That in itself seemed to lower the story for me.
0385344333|1.0|I have been a faithful and devoted fan since I found Lee Child's first book at Borders. I have hooked many friends on this series and as a Borders employee, I recommended to any mystery/thriller lover I came across.  I do not wait for paperback--I go straight for the hardcover.  This last book, however, is a disappointment.  When I was 2/3 of the way through it, I put it aside and went on to something else.  WANTED MAN drags. It is slow.  The thrills and excitement are not there.  Riding in a car for the majority of the book?  Please. I feel as though Jack Reacher has lost his spunk. The character, Julia Sorenson, was far more interesting that Jack.  I hope this is just a glitch and that the next Jack Reacher book will be much, much better.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|Just go to You Tube for your video or show.  Once worked fine and does not work at all now--waste of $1.99.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|I saw a piece of her work several years ago mixed in with several other contemporary painters when I was visiting another city.  I thought oh, hum, another surrealist painting of women's issues.  Dead stylized animal around her neck.  Been done.  I must have missed the date it was painted, because after I discovered her anew, I realized that she was probably the catalyst behind so many painters after her.  I began to read about her life, and was fascinated, intrigued by the manifest of her energy in the paintings, and broadened by learning about the symbolism that permeates them. Not to mention the political arena that encircled her life. Like most Americans, what little history I've gotten through public schools has quite glaringly not been about Africa, Asia or South America.<br /><br />The acting and story are just incredible - so incredible that my friend and I who know less about Russian and Mexican history than we care to admit, found ourselves saying how remarkable everything was, and could she or he have really done that?  And Trotsky?  And yet apparently it happened.  The movie found its way through one moment after another with its own art along the way.  The artistic expression was beautiful and I thought reflected her well, intermingling her images, and making new ones within the cinematic story.  I think the director showed incredible creativity while displaying a great deal of self-restraint.  Frida could so easily have gotten lost in the very many details about her life.<br /><br />I think that Frida would have loved how this story became yet another illustrated piece of her history.  I dislike being too flowery about reviews, but I was touched by how true this movie stayed to a courageous artist and woman.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|So many unresolved story lines!  too many cliff hangers, what was the point of giving so much time to so many characters if their lives did not matter in the end to the denouement ...unless there is a 6th book.  So it‘s like a tv show trying to stay alive for as long as people will watch.  DISAPPOINTING!
B005H9B44A|5.0|This was much more than I expected!  A fantastic mix of fantasy, sci-fi, action and love.  The visuals were outstanding, great acting and not a dull moment.  I am really looking forward to Thor 2 which I believe is coming out in 2013.
B00785P2QC|5.0|- I actually LOVE &lt;33 thise game  ... I thought it would be boring and then I'll have to uninstall it but I really , really , really like it  :DDD
B0058VW36U|4.0|The kids and I really enjoy it. It can be a great time killer and really make the kids think about what to do!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|it's a fun game, has pleasing graphics and simple mechanics, and is constantly being updated with more games. I got it as a free app, and don't regret my choice
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|The movie itself is amazing...the movie downloaded on the kindle fire...not so much. I can hear games from across the room, but cannot hear the movie without it next to my ear (which causes a viewing issue). The only way it is watchable is with headphones and the movie and main volumes on the highest levels...and that is only in a silent room. Disappointed!
B008YW5RH2|5.0|One of the best games I ever played on a pad..wish you guys had a football,baseball and soccer games, look forward to more games ...
B008S4YZCO|4.0|Good time waster, I played for about a month once a day and then the game erased itself.  Such a shame. Definately worth a download.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun game. No problem with usage on the Kindle Fire like other games. Not overly hard, but not a walk in the park either.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Really fun! nice and long...highly recommend.  if u don't like hidden object games u might be annoyed. good consistent cheats and good game flow.
0525953728|5.0|This is an action packed experience of a navy SEAL who shared his story of the daring successful mission of taking out the public enemy number 1!<br /><br />Mark shared how he was determined to devote himself in protecting America when he was young.  He fulfilled his dream under vigorous training and practice.  This book takes an inside look on campus and training grounds.  They are the few specials.  The secret mission into Pakistan to the compound minute by minute  description was vivid as if in an action Hollywood movie.  It is a thrill to witness with his first account of action in step by step.  This action registered in million Americans mind with the  TV image of the general, President Obama and Hilary Clinton who held her mouth and breath on their flat screen.<br /><br />Reading this action book help understand how US government put the energy and endeavor in keeping America safe with the admiration of the courage of Team Six SEALs.<br /><br />I salute the team of warriors for their patriotism and the mission accomplished.  Well done fellas!  We are proud of you!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had me reading way past my bedtime. There were major twists and turns that I never expected. I don't read a lot of mysteries like this but it was really good. Characters were believable and relatable and the story just kept me turning pages. I didn't love the ending but until then it was a book I would highly recommend.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book! I am a huge fan of 50 shades and a friend recommended this to me...I'm so glad she did. Can't wait for the next installment!!!
B005G5PPGS|3.0|Great story of how to overcome the obstacles that you face in life. very well written and a fun read
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app totally helped me connect with God! All the reading plans are awesome and I absolutely LOVE everything this app has to offer as far as getting connected reminders highliting and all those things my only problem is I wish I had more time to use it!
B005LAIHSG|1.0|Negatives:<br />Miscast. Lots of overacting and exaggeration that made the entire story seem artificial. Stewart was probably cast as a \\"Twilight\\" marketing look effect.<br />Seen any of these stereotyped, non-creative, Hollywood fantasy before?<br />(1.) Medieval women who have lots of eye liner; manicured eye brows; lipstick; men and women with braided hair. All Hollywood.<br />(2.) Horses with lots of armor including face masks. Hollywood.<br />(3.) Dialogue such as \\"She is of the blood.\\" or \\"We mean you no harm!\\" Inane, give me a break - Hollywood.<br />(4.) Lots of big fat candles (weren't being made then) that look like they were bought at Target or Wal-Mart. Lots of big flaming bonfires. Hollywood.<br />(5.) Hero tames some wild beast by just being nice to it. Wild beast has the current rage CGI effect of piranha teeth. Hollywood.<br />(6.) Hero jumps on and rides a wild horse (without a saddle, even) like a pro even though she's just spent the overwhelming part of her young life enclosed in a small prison cell. Another white horse. Hollywood.<br />(7.) Fairies, rabbits, butterflies and mushrooms. White reindeer with big antlers standing next to big tree and water.  Hollywood non-creative borrowing on the verge of idea theft.<br />(8.) Sing along, fireside camping of Snow & dwarves. Artificial e.g.no insects to be found. Hollywood.<br />(9.) All the fake synthetic leather clothing that looks like a came out of the prop room from previous similar fantasy period movies.<br />(10.) The now decades old CGI of things being killed then turning into ashes, in this case little broken pieces, when being struck. The now cheap and getting old CGI morphing software.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|very easy read, didnt want to leave it down. was glad that it wasnt predictable and handled a very serious topic with dignity, respect and humour. thoroughly enjoyed it.
0553801473|3.0|Meh. Martin has written so many pages that he has become his own cliche. He is stuck in a loop fueled by the originally interesting (for 3 books) style of liquidating your favorite \\"heroes\\". Meanwhile, the pile-on of new and not fleshed-out characters is, sorry, a pain. I read it (and sort of enjoyed it) but it wasn't anything to recommend. I tell my friends to stop at book 4.<br /><br />This doesn't bode well for the HBO series. If Martin can't at least point us to an end game (\\"End Game of Thrones\\"!!)then Hollywood isn't going to invest in much more than one more season...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. The story was able to capture you in a different time where people weren't as fortunate as they are today. It also gets you caught up in a love triangle that makes it impossible not to pick up the next book.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game is boss this is the best mmorpg for kindle out there I really like the graphics and anyone that don't like it can go **** themselfs have a nice day:)
B008BRC7BE|5.0|The best material I have heard in years..Thanks to Ian & Tony !<br /><br />The Compilation is awesome , & the new tracks are bliss..I wonder How Tony can come with those riffs years after years and Ian's voice is a golden toppy lining....I am happy that I bought it !
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is really cool...helps to pass the time...just like at the carnival minus the dirty hands left from the coins.
B002LHRM2E|5.0|Don't hesitate and read it as soon as you can! You'll find it very interesting and its novel style makes it easier to understand it.
1932100660|5.0|I heard about this book from a high school friend of mine who was having some health issues. I was intrigued when she said it changed her life. Turns out I bought the book and it has changed my life and the lives of my family. The wealth of info about diet and nutrition makes so much sense! The things I learned from this book I was able to immediately implement into my life for the better. I'm giving copies of this book to people I love for Christmas this year :)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've spent hours and hours playing this game and have enjoyed every single minute. They add new puzzles all the time. It's the most-played game on my Kindle.
B003INBOE2|5.0|I was looking for these movies on Blu Ray for the longest and when I saw them here I'd had to get em. Didn't even know there was a 3rd movie but of course I had to get that one too. Very easy, fast shipping, would definitely buy from again.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|This was a very good quick read. I really enjoyed it and loved the characters. If you like Nicholas Sparks books you will enjoy this one for sure.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I have to admit I am a sci-fi, horror and comic book movie fan. There aren't alot of mystery thrillers that catch my eye but this did. I did enjoy the novels and the original film trilogy despite it being in a foreign language. So I was very excited for the US version of the first film and boy did the movie pay off. I loved all the performances from Daniel, Stellan, Christopher, Robin along with the rest of the cast. But Rooney Mara really stands out for me and I am sure for alot of people who saw this in the theaters last year. She deserved all the recognition she got from this performance as Lisbeth Salander. I really enjoyed it and will be looking forward to the next two films in the trilogy in the coming years. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loved the novels and the original Swedish film trilogy.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|I love this movie, saw it twice in theaters and couldn't resist renting when I saw it, even though we will buy the blu ray. One thing that has always bothered me wih on demand is lack of subtitles. But usually it can be turned up to hear it. This movie was horrible though!! We have an awesome sound system, and usually at 25% we are blasted out of our seats. We had it at 100% and could still barely hear any of the dialog at all. It was really ridiculous. I regret the $5 for the hd version because we could barely understand it. Do yourself a favor, just buy the disc, because you'll love the movie, but this version will ruin it for you. Especially if it is your first time.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|This movie was amazing. I saw it for the first time on netflix and I bawled my eyes out the entire movie. Its about s boy who loses his father in 9/11 and tries to make sense of a senseless act of violence. It made my heart go out to all of the families who lost someone that day. Also I think this is the one movie I can say I liked even better than the book and the book is really great too. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Fairly good read, I see few secrets of Seals compromised.  Might have used a ghost writer to spice it up to hold my interest at times, but still ok and wouldn't want to take away from the truth.
0547564651|5.0|It is NOT how smart your child is : it's how much self-control , discipline , forthrightness ....ie character traits....your child possesses that will determine success and happiness in life . This book is a must read for parents . Although dense is spots it gets across a simple and powerful message in a straightforward way : character counts .
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Edited again 5-26-13: it took a while but I finally maced this game. I thing it took about 1 month after my last update & I was playing at least 2-3 times a week. Finally I had earned all the upgrades so there were no more goals. At that point, it was no longer fun to play. I will keep my rating @ 5 stars though because for a game of chance it had a lot of playability before it was deleted from my kindle!<br /><br />edited review 10-19-12: OK - embarrassing, but I got addicted to this game.  It is mostly chance, but is fun to try to strategically place your dropped coins.  I wanted to update, because as I continue to play, and the prizes fall - they gather into collections. When a collection is complete, it gives bonuses (bonus coins, etc) that make winning easier, and extend game play.  This is important to know when you read reviews about how 'long it takes' for coins to regenerate as some of these bonuses include faster and higher coin regeneration!!<br /><br />I continue to enjoy this game a full 3 weeks after downloading it; not many of my game downloads last that long on my Kindle! Rating raised from a 4* to a 5*... thanks developers and Amazon FAOTD!<br /><br />orig review: fun to play... frustrating at times when you run out of coins right when the shower is ready to fall. it is just like the arcade game though!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Kristen Stewart gives notice that she is a screen presence---one that we are going to see in a lot more serious roles . The physicality of her role makes this a stunning performance . For a young woman to handle the final scene where she rallied the troops and then led them into battle is probably one of the most difficult things for an actress to do credibly. And she pulled it off with aplomb .
B004UID2LC|1.0|Every time i click on download as video button it shows &quot;searching&quot; for a split second under the video then blank. Nothing being downloaded in the download section no matter which videos i try. It used to work a while back I'm not really sure which version i had at the time but when i tried using it in August it would download once in a while and now.... never downloads. This applies for videos, mp3, etc. i did also try with the newest version 2.2.9 as well as uninstalling and reinstalling. Please fix this!!!!! -Galaxy S3
159420411X|5.0|Blessed are the Quants for they shall inherit the conversation.....Nate  Silver is the wunderkind who burst onto the scene with his blog that supplied  intellectual elbow grease to issues of probability analysis . In his new book he wanders like a modern day Socrates searching for those with true wisdom . And he finds it--among modest , hardworking , humble folks across an array of industries and government institutions . A wonderful read.
B004Z7AHZC|4.0|This is not a film that grown ups are immediately drawn to.  However, It was sweet, thoughtful and Oh So Funny! The family characters were all fully developed and very well acted! I'm glad my 10 year old talked me into seeing it!  It was great to laugh together!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I believe I have read this book five tims, at least. Now that I'm loosing my eyesight, I am enjoying this even more by listening to this wonderful narration.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is a game everybody would want to play because its fun to go mining and find diamonds and gold and iron and coal lapis also you will have fun killing creepers and other mobs like skeletons spiders endearment and zombies its fantastic
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This is a fun game.  I enjoy testing myself on my hand eye coordination.  My 15 year old son loves it too!
B001EC3JME|5.0|Great holster came fast and as shown holds most of my flashlights but is a little bulky for everyday carry.
B008FIHUDO|5.0|I'm only giving this five stars because I can't give it ten! Bettye is a woman who's only gotten critical acclaim in the last ten years or so and yet she's every damn good and better in most cases than any soul diva you care to name! She takes a song and interprets it in her own way breathing fire and passion into it that brings original songwriters to tears as Pete Townsend was in the Kennedy Center Honors when she nailed \\"Love Reign Oe'r Me\\".<br />On her latest she covers a host of varied songwriters from Tom Waits to Neil Young and does a smashing job on every track. Opening with \\"Everything's Broken\\", everything you'd want from a modern blues track she lures you in with a voice that just doesn't quit. \\"I'm Not The One\\" follows with a tough woman laying down the law and from what I've read so far in her new bio, \\"A Woman Like Me\\" [also highly recommended] this track could have been written for her.<br />She breathes new life into two different takes of a D'abo penned Rod Stewart ballad, \\"Dirty Old Town\\", one more uptempo while the other more smokey blues.<br />One of my favorite tracks is \\"I'm Tired\\" originally done by the Brit Blues combo, Savoy Brown but seriously with the instrument this woman possesses with her voice, she could sing the dictionary and put chills up your spine or tears in your eyes! She's just THAT GOOD!!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It was alot of fun and I got to level 30.  I started getting to be an unrealistic amount of time, so I decided to purchase some dollars for extra energy.  Then it froze up and messed up my kindle.  The game cash never showed up and the app quit working.  I can't get a refund from amazon for the $20 I lost.  It's my mistake that I got so into it to pay cash, but now I lost my money so warning others to to even bother.  There are so many glitches in the game.  It's fun at the beginning until it gets you addicted so you have to put money it it that will not work.
B008MEM24S|5.0|very entertaining!  I play until my eyes get blurry!  the puzzles get more and more challenging as the game progresses.  I love the commentary from the other characters.
B000JFHECI|5.0|There they are in all of their glory. Great live performances. Songs from the Ummagumma to Meddle time frame, plus+plus,snippets from the recording sessions for Dark Side of the Moon. A rock film of the highest caliber,get this one.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|First off, I was a hardcore PC gamer. The only reason why I play on a PS3 now is because I cannot afford a PC gaming rig. So I just bought games that where not first person shooters for my PS3; except a few like black ops.<br /><br />Anyway, I bought the Eagle Eye, having doubts. When I first installed it and followed the instructions it didnt even work. But I had nothing better to do so I kept messing around with it until it finally worked.<br /><br />AND OMG this thing is AMAZING! They finally DID IT!!! I cannot believe it! I played Black Ops and it was about 90% close to a PC experience . I played Aliens Vs. Predator and it sucked, but that game just sucks anyway. I played Dues Ex and it was pretty awesome.<br /><br />I mean there is no way to be the PC unless you got a PC, but man this product the Eagle Eye, is really close. And that is an amazing feat. I can now buy FPS games for the PS3 and have fun playing them. Because I grew up with mouse and KB, so maybe the younger kids today can do it with a game pad, but I cannot. The Eagle Eye changed that for me. Now I am not gonna get on any multiplayer games...but I can enjoy single player FPS games on a console now.<br /><br />I have a really cheap mouse, so as awesome as the Eagle Eye is, the mouse I am using is killing the experience. So I recommend getting a good mouse, maybe not the crazy death adder $90 dollar style, but something above $10 bucks. I am going to get a better mouse now that I know the Eagle Eye does what it says it can do.<br /><br />So, the final verdict; the Eagle Eye is absolutely awesome! It is worth every penny, if you can't afford that nice gaming PC but still would like to play FPS on your console; it is very close to a PC experience. Plus I have not even tuned it, right out of the box it worked great and thats with my crappy mouse. So, if your stuck on console, or you dont want a gaming PC, the Eagle Eye is a must!<br /><br />Amazing product thank god someone finally did it.<br /><br />Oh and I bought it at Frys for $50
B003YMNVCA|3.0|I've only used the book for a few projects so far.  It's well written and appears to be comprehensive, and I expect it will be a go-to reference.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in the Kindle version, however.  This is the first technical book I've ordered for the Kindle, and I was expecting it to be similar to the PDFs I have for other books.  Navigation is a major pain and page numbers don't make any sense.  This is the first Kindle book I've ordered, and I'm reading it on my Mac, so part of the problem might just be inexperience with the format.  Readers who are used to the Kindle might not be bothered by these shortcomings, but I would definitely not have bought the book if I had known how poor the interface is.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It would probably be fair to assume that this book would be a half-way poorly written piece of work, solely selling because it was first to tell the story of the mission to take out UBL. As a matter of fact, that is what I suspected when I bought the book.<br /><br />The recount of the planning of, training for and execution of the UBL mission is very detailed - not ad nauseum or boring, but to the level you would expect from a book by this title. That is what I expected. What I did not expect, however, was to find that the book is very well researched, well written and containing a lot of information on the task, training and not least sacrifice of the SEALs in general, as well as the acquaintance one makes with the politics governing (and sometimes hampering) SEAL operations.<br /><br />No Easy Day is, by far, the best book on the topic of SEALs I have read to date. Not only on the UBL mission, but on the topic in general. Well done.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|Economical purchase for fans of the Harry Bosch series but if you are not an afficianado of the series, this isn't the place to jump in.  Quick, entertaining read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A clever page turner for fans of \\"Fargo\\" and \\"To Die For\\".<br />At times it seems in fact thought originally for a movie.<br />I can actually picture Nicole Kidman as Amy, Patrick Wilson as Nick and Frances Mc Dormand as Boney.<br />Up until 3/4 of the book the plot is awesome. The end is a bit too surreal for my taste though.<br />All in all, I love it and strongly suggest it to anybody who share a bed at night with somebody on a regular basis.<br />Enjoy it ... (and watch your back) :-)!!
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|This is not a review of the movie itself. The packaging is horrible. The discs were stacked on top of each other. I watched the 3D version and it was awesome. Then we put in the regular blu ray disc so that we could watch the special features. The 2D disc crashed after 1:30. We then tried playing the 3D disc again but that disc has stopped working as well.  I have read some other reviews online that suggests that Samsung might have a firmware update in the next six weeks that will fix the problem.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|many pp call this book dirty- how untrue truly great work of fiction intellectually challanging and  sensational read, hard to put down- great airplane read or weekend take yourself to another world
B008FIHUDO|4.0|Firstly - the combination of Ms LaVette and Craig Street works well - the vibe between the band and the singer is great and the recording is superb. The 'fast' version of \\"Dirty Old Town\\" and \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" are wonderful sublime, soul outings - after these, the rest of the album pales in comparison. It is by no means less than okay - I just did not appreciate some of the selections e.g., the title track. But the album stays with you - listening to it a couple of times - especially the track \\"Yesterday Is Here\\" - I heard shades of Alberta Hunter's Cookery albums - great praise and perhaps a new direction for Ms. LaVette - not bad at 67!  Listening to \\"Dirty Old Town\\" and the rumbling guitar track brought back the feel of Memphis and had personally had me wishing that the album had the same feel throughout and wondering what would happen if Ms LaVette teamed up with Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham, Allen Toussaint or Dr. John.  This one track is worth 4 stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very nice.  Peacefull and calm. I liked it because you need to plan out what you have to<br />do and you must use strategy. Definitely worth its price.
1611761565|5.0|I enjoyed listening to the exploits of our servicemen and women.  The cd's did not let the listener know when to switch cd's at the end of each one.  I caught myself listening to the same cd over.  This book confirmed a couple of incidents that the SEALS were involved in.  The somolie pirates was one.  Thanks for getting the facts out so that the American people can decide.  GO NAVY.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Its season four of one of the best series on TV at the moment. It showed up exteremly fast; I was very pleased over all.

B004SIP7AS|1.0|this movie has rave reviews yet when watching it, not only myself but three others at our movie night were bored with this slow moving slow unraveling story. never saw the end as i was the last to leave the room and find something else to do after about 20 minutes. sure is disappointing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is highly addictive for people who enjoy games that involves solving puzzles. Unlike any other game I've played in recent memory. Children and adults both will love it and hate it at the same time! Impossible to stop after just one board. Thank you Big Duck Games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app provides many versions of the Bible from which I can choose.  I enjoy using it and it's very easy to navigate.  The only downside is I'll have to explain to the 'older' members of my church I'm not checking emails but actually using my smartphone as my Bible text!  :)
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had heard good things about this book coming in, and it hasn't disappointed.  I have been thoroughly entertained from the start!
B0086449YA|5.0|This is a great double CD. I almost didn't get it now with the thought of purchasing later if and when the price dropped a little. However, the reviews were so positive that I went ahead and got it. I'm glad I did. I am enjoying the entire set. A little Celtic, and blues along with a few ballads make for a good blend. Good guitar work along with some good harmonica on the blues tracks; some excellent guitar work on the ballads. I take it to listen to in my truck, as well as at home.<br />I recommend this double CD if your a fan. The maturing of the artist is both apparent and welcomed as I get older too.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This book was typical of a Jack Reacher novel.  It reads as though he is talking directly to the reader. It was a page-turner, and perhaps left the reader in a bit more suspense than usual as to what was really going on. Reacher fans won't be disappointed.
B005721W9O|5.0|My dad is a trekkie, I grew up watching them all. Although I didn't grow up to be the Star Trek fan my father hoped for, I have an appreciation for the series. That said, I LOVE THIS MOVIE. It has a stellar cast, including my personal favorite, Sigourney Weaver. A solid plot for what could be considered a parody, but don't you dare compare it to any of the \\"_____ Movie\\" parodies, this movie doesn't rely on cheap bathroom humor for laughs. And while it is a Star Trek parody of sorts, you don't need to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this movie.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was alot like 50 shades but I think I may have actually liked this book better. I can't wait for part 2 in October!
B001H9JBW6|5.0|This is hands down one of the best series I've seen in a long time. The acting is superb and the plot won't unfold till the very end. Make sure you have plenty of time to watch it because it's pretty hard to walk away from.<br /><br />The story deals with surveillance, and to what extent it will encroach on our lives, what's so scary about it is that most of what they show is already here. What makes this unique is that my entire family loved it, both my brothers and my parents thought it was great.<br /><br />I find it very hard to find fault with it. Some people may think that it's a bit long and drawn out, personally I don't think so, the characters are well developed and the plot ever thickening.
B0054S6N04|5.0|This book is the perfect mix of humor, romance and murder mystery.  It has remained a favorite of mine over the years and after multiple check-outs from the library I finally splurged on the Kindle version.  It takes a good author to actually make me laugh out loud as I'm reading and this book does it!  I recommend it!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is amazing! I love the Avengers. I was counting down the days when I can finally watch it again. It's a must for any Marvel fan!
0743299795|5.0|A great, even entertaining read, and not only for those interested in Lean Production/Manufacturing.  The history behind the development of these methodologies is interesting and provides one with a good foundation.
B004YOEFG8|3.0|I love space, I love 3D IMAX productions, and I love 10+ minutes of this 45 minute documentary, but I don't love the price. It just doesn't seem right that you pay the same for a 2 hour movie for a documentary thats under an hour.. Fortunately the prices on Amazon are better than you'd find in a store, but even so.. Half of the video is sort of filler too, so I have to give this 3 stars.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Thought is was boring and pretentious.  Don't get at all why some people love this movie.  It tried to be intelligent but was really just overblown
B005KELW26|5.0|I ordered the Belkin because it was purple. Now that I have it and am using it, I can say it seems to be of good quality materials, made well and I'm sure it will serve well for a long time. And best of all---------It's purple!!!
B0034G4P80|1.0|This movie in its entirety was horrible, laughable, and sad. This will be a short but succinct review.<br /><br />The premise = totally predictable<br />The script = simplistic and comic book-like lines (was that on purpose like Sin City? if so, fail!)<br />The artistic design = rip-offs from LOTR, Star Wars, etc...<br />The acting = disappointing, especially in regards to senior actors like Sir Anthony Hopkins<br /><br />The only positive factor, which I am sure was not the plan, was that this movie was so bad, it was hilariously so! I laughed my head off AT the movie to the pathetic end.<br /><br />At least Joss Whedon somewhat redeemed Thor's character in The Avengers. Now that was a great film!
B000URWYTS|5.0|This is a really good read.  It's fiction, but there's so much fact woven into the story that it seems more than just a novel (not that there's anything wrong with a good novel.)
B006TKP2B2|5.0|A great read. It was so realistic, I could feel the heat of the city. I would really like to see the book made into a movie. I'm now going to take a look at other books by this excellent writer.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app use to work and now it keeps force closing or saying my connection is bad when I have all bars... this app is screwy
0887081770|3.0|This is a good story by Eric Carle. I would have given it 5 stars but the format of the book is awkward. The first time we read the book , the lift- open pages tore. When we tried to unfold the large page that represents the full moon, it tore and was hard to refold correctly so that the book would close completely. Even though the lift-up pages have arrows pointing the direction in which to lift them, they are still hard to open. We love the story but the book is awkward to handle.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I ENJOYED THE BOOK VERY MUCH.  THE SEALS DID A TREMENDOUS JOB.  I ALSO LIKE THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR IS DONATING A PERCENTAGE OF HIS SALES TO A VERY WORTH CAUSE FOR THE MILITARY.

B0012TWRAO|4.0|I was looking for a mounting device for a digital cam (Kodak Sport) to make videos of my MC rides. Someone told me about RAM. I checked their page and saw a wide variaty of possibilities. This page helped me to find the matching parts. Finally I ordered at Amazon.<br /><br />The system itself is great bc of that ball you can fix your device 360° degrees.<br /><br />The only thing I am disappointed is the quality of the paint coat. Parts of the connection of the ball and the base are not fully painted. See pictures. I won't affect the function but it looks cheesy.<br /><br />I also bought a mounting device for a 7\\" tablet which keeps my tablet tight.<br /><br />I can recommend it.
034580404X|5.0|Beneath the detailed sex is the most beautiful love story I've ever read.  So much action and detail, a second reading is needed to capture it all.  You become a part of their lives and can't stop reading.  Highly recommend.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, it's absolutely adorable and I kept getting the feeling that I would have loved it a whole lot more if it had been out when I was a teen. I think Perkins does a great job in getting inside the head of a confused teenage girl (confused because all teens are prone to confusion, it's part of the life cycle).<br />I think one of the reasons I felt connected to this book is that I also studied abroad, I didn't go to a boarding school or anything but I feel the experience you get from living in another country really broadens horizons. I understood how Anna felt throughout the story and how sometimes you can have a love-hate relationship with a country only to realize its true value once you have to move on.<br />what I loved most about this book is that Perkins populated her literary world with smart main characters and there is nothing more attractive to me in a book then that. I think I would have hated reading a book about teenage angst if Anna would have been dumb or head over heels over someone who didn't seem to be worth it.<br />I didn't want to give it more stars because I think the story and the writing could have been better. Stephanie Perkins is a writer with great potential, her ideas are great but she needs a little work on delivering them. I felt sometimes that certain things were obvious but she had to clear them up and explain when there was no explanation needed. I also felt that as a reader I was ahead of the main character the whole way through (I didn't really mind with this story) and I think writers should work on making certain things less predictable or cliche.<br /><br />Still I really did love this book...it got me feeling and reminiscing about my teenage years which in a way is great, because I would never want to relive that time period again, but being able to feel with the intensity one feels as an adolescent is always a gift when you are older, usually because it's hard for it to happen again.

B008C1O8CA|1.0|Looks like another great band has had their day. I've been with GD from the beginning and have really enjoyed hearing their music mature and watching the band become better every album.  Unfortunately this album ended that ride. This collection might be really cool to a 13 year old, but to a longtime fan it has nothing to offer. The songs are weakly written and the subject matter is completely childish. Really an embarrassing output for a talented band. Ugggh!

0316228532|3.0|The Casual Vacancy by J.K. Rowling is perhaps somewhat of enigma. I, just like countless thousands of other readers was so curious about what this author would come up with after so many hugely popular Harry Potter books. This book was in a way, refreshing, and in a way disappointing. Let me explain.<br /> I knew going in after watching the news coverage on the release of this book, that it was intended for adults. I also knew that it was a...bit off the beaten path, particularly when held in comparison to her previous books. I think that is where we reviewers may be going wrong. As much as we swear we will not judge this novel off of previous books by this author, the magic and wonder of her previous series is steadfastly and stubbornly locked in our minds.<br /> I did my best to lay Harry and his magical friends to rest when I picked up \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\" So from here on I will not mention the previous series again.<br /> What I loved about this book: This book was funny at times, sad at others and moved along at a good enough clip to keep my mind occupied. I thought the town was great, the characters were sharp and the writing itself was very good. I liked that the author told the fans what she wanted to write this time rather than beat a dying horse to death and stick with the program.<br /> I liked that the ending left you wondering certain things and yet answered the most important things. I thought the book was well edited and intelligent, regardless of the subject matter.<br /> What I didn't like: (Attempting to do this without spoilers) I really couldn't see how some of the material in this book could be considered as coming from a comedic standpoint. The opinion I got when watching the pre-release coverage for this book was that it was supposed to be tinged with comedy. Some of the issues in this book are just plain depressing and not at all what I would have considered a topic to laugh about.<br /> I found an undercurrent throughout this book that strangely, made me hate it for the same reason I loved it. I felt as though the author went to extremes trying to prove that she could write something other than young adult fiction, that in an odd way, made the writing came out a bit juvenile.<br /> I also felt that the author spent a bit too little time on description and a bit too much time pondering the macabre. Perhaps it was just me, but I came away feeling a bit dry. For me, this book was like sitting on a hilltop with your camera poised on a beautiful sky waiting for that perfect sunset. All of a sudden, your expectations are shattered when a huge cloud moves in front of the sun and ruins the shot. I expected so much for a book that was five years in the making. I did not feel this book measured up to that expectation.<br /> J.K. Rowling previously said that she would not want to talk to anyone who did not cry at the end of this book. I hope I am not the first to disappoint her, but Not a single tear did I shed. I seriously came away feeling casually vacant.<br /> To those of you who are moaning and groaning over the prices of the kindle books and leaving negative reviews...it is wingardium leviosa....NOT Wingardium Levi-o-sahhhhhhh.

B008C1O8CA|4.0|I've been a Green Day (GD) fan since \\"Dookie\\" took over the world and I've enjoyed their music since. Some records, like 2000's \\"Warning\\", have been sketchy at best with maybe half a record being great and the rest not so much. \\"Uno\\" feels to me like this kind of GD record.<br /><br />There are quite a few songs that, despite repeat listenings, I can't get into and feel very throwaway. Compare \\"Troublemaker\\", \\"Loss of Control\\", \\"Sweet 16\\" and \\"Fell For You\\" (which sounds like \\"Nimrod\\"-era GD) to some of GD's B-sides from the late 90s like \\"Desensitized\\", \\"Scumbag\\" or \\"Ha Ha You're Dead\\" and the B-sides actually sound far better than these supposed A-sides (you can get these B-sides on their record \\"Shenanigans\\"). If GD weren't doing 3 records in 4 months and were just doing 1, would some of these songs be cut? Most definitely.<br /><br />But this is GD, gdammit! Billie-Joe is such a talented songwriter he can't help but put some excellent tunes on the record. \\"Nuclear Family\\" opens the record with an instantly likeable, punchy, poppy, energetic hook that grabs you and makes you want to jump and sing. And thankfully it's this quality in a number of songs on this record that make \\"Uno\\" worth listening to for any GD fan. \\"Let Yourself Go\\" and \\"Carpe Diem\\" are both classic GD-sounding songs while the enjoyable \\"Angel Blue\\" opening riff sounds like The Clash's \\"I Fought the Law\\" before moving into that stop-start rhythm that Billie-Joe's perfected over the years.<br /><br />Even in the most targeted-by-critics song on the record \\"Kill the DJ\\", there's a moment in the song that I thought was a nice touch (but most people are right, this song is pretty bad). Despite a very average first single in \\"Oh Love\\", tunes like \\"Rusty James\\" and \\"Stay the Night\\" are undeniable and they're too fun for any GD fan not to enjoy.<br /><br />So is this a masterpiece like \\"American Idiot\\" or \\"Nimrod\\"? Nope, but like the last record \\"21st Century Breakdown\\", there are a number of excellent songs on here that are pure pop-punk with amazing riffs and fantastic tunes that'll get into your head and heart and make you smile and sing. \\"Uno\\" is definitely worth a listen and showcases a band that remains ambitious despite 20+ years in the business. Green Day continue to make fun, entertaining records and put on outstanding live sets - a few weak songs are definitely excusable when balanced out with some wonderful songs that nobody else but Green Day could've written. Welcome back guys, bring on \\"Dos\\" and \\"Tre\\"!songs on here that are pure pop-punk with amazing riffs and fantastic tunes that'll get into your head and heart and make you smile and sing. \\"Uno\\" is definitely worth a listen and showcases a band that remains ambitious despite 20+ years in the business.

0316228532|2.0|I had to stop reading at around page 130. To say that this book is dysfunctional would be an understatement. It portrays humans in the worst light possible, and I saw absolutely no redeeming qualities in the characters (and there are many-- which is another thing, I couldn't even keep everyone straight!) I see this book as JK Rowling's experimentation with extremely upsetting subjects and multiple point of views. But I have to say, I don't think this experiment is a successful one and I hope she never writes something so depressing again.<br /><br />Now to get into some things that absolutely didn't work and why I gave up on The Casual Vacancy. I love dialogue in books. In fact, I am more of a dialogue person than a long narration person because I feel like stories should be about people, not endless descriptions.  But the dialogue was just awful. Let me explain why. Firstly, she uses grammatically incorrect speech in order to show the social statuses of the characters. I know a lot of writers use this stylistic choice, but I've never liked it because not only is it distracting, but it can also be difficult to figure out what the character is trying to say. I don't want to have to stop reading so I can puzzle over sentences. Secondly, the swearing. I am not easily offended by swearing, but when some of the characters use the f-bomb about twenty times in two pages, that is just unnecessary. The dialogue reads like a TV show, and had this been a screenplay, I wouldn't have minded the style she used. However, this is the written word and those choices don't work as well in book format.<br /><br />Now to get to the characters. As I mentioned before, I could not remember all of them. JK Rowling uses new chapters for each character POV, but when so many of them are being thrown at you and the chapters themselves are short, it's hard for one of them to make an impression on you. I usually like flawed characters, but almost every single one of these particular characters disgusted me in some way and I could not relate to any of them. I don't want to read about horny teenage boys. I don't want to read about drug addicts who can't take care of themselves or their children. I don't want to read about the petty cruelty of people living in a small community. I will go as far to say that the characters in this book represent everything I hate about humanity. Reading about people like this just negatively reinforces my own beliefs that human beings are horribly messed up. It makes me angry and then I dwell on things I would rather not dwell on. After reading some other reviews on here that included spoilers, I'm glad that I've stopped reading when I have as the subject matter gets even worse.<br /><br />This was just a bad fit for me because I don't read this genre in general. I don't like gritty stories, but I wanted to give it a chance because it was from JK Rowling. And for fans of Harry Potter, this couldn't be more different. It's actually shocking to me that the same author wrote this, but I think that's the reaction she was going for. If JK Rowling wanted to show everyone that she could write something steeped in realism while being brutally honest about the deviancy of her characters, then she succeeded. She recently said in an interview she will continue to write as long as she has something to say. And there's definitely a message here about people living in small towns and about the state of humanity in general, but I want some hope in the things I read, even if it's just a little bit. After waiting five years to read her new work, this was a huge let down for me. I'll be returning my book.sgusted me in some way and I could not relate to any of them.

B000FBJAOG|4.0|Amazing work of fiction. Well written and some solid advice for the sort of zombie apocalypse that could never happen. If this book dealt with zombies that are virus-based (I.E. Zombieland, Resident Evil)it would have been far more useful. As there are far more ways to alter the brain of a living human being to be aggressive, uncoordinated and feel no pain than there are ways to reanimate the dead.<br /><br />Also, The section on what primary firearm to choose is somewhat lacking. Operating on a stereotype and outdated information than research. The issue in Vietnam that caused the rifle to malfunction so often was attributed to the lot of ammo that they were using at the time. Not the gun its self. Once they recalled all the bad ammo, the gun's performance and reliability improved ten-fold. As it is the standard assault weapon of US military soldiers and law enforcement alike, ammo for the m16 will be far more plentiful and easier to obtain than AK-47 ammo. The AR is lighter and depending on what parts are used to build it, just as useful in melee as the AK. But due to the direct gas impingement system it uses to cycle the bolt, the gun runs hotter and gets dirtier faster. Both of these factors reduce weapon reliability somewhat, but are easily rectified by regularly caring for your weapon. The AK's gas piston system allow for a cooler, cleaner-running gun for longer periods of sustained fire, but the system is more complex, has more moving parts, more points of failure and will fail just as easily as any other gun if not properly cared for. It is also heavier because of the extra parts involved in the gas piston system. Ammo for the AK  will be less plentiful, but it is dirt cheap, and designed to be effective at longer range than AR-15 ammo. The one downside is, unlike M16 ammo which fragments and does significant internal damage to a target on impact, AK47 ammo will penetrate and leave a comparatively small wound channel. Which will be less effective against any kind of zombie due to the fact that they will either only be vulnerable to total destruction of the brain stem, or so hopped up on their own body chemicals that they will shrug off anything that doesn't do catastrophic damage to the internal organs.<br /><br />In my opinion, an AK47 would be best for a well fortified defense bunker. Whereas an M16 would be best suited to survival on the move.kind of zombie due to the fact that they will either only be vulnerable to total destruction of the brain stem, or so hopped up on their own body chemicals that they will shrug off anything that doesn't do catastrophic damage to the internal organs.<br /><br />In my opinion, an AK47 would be best for a well fortified defense bunker.

B008X8QCTO|5.0|Had a couple glitches here and there with freezes and needed force closes, BUT compared to what the other reviews are saying I'm thrilled I went for it. I bought the WHOLE .99 cent extra chapter from the beginning, Alawar fans should be used to this by now. If the game is less then 2.00 bucks from the start expect a fee somewhere.<br />The game was Fantastic. ALAWAR THE WRITING WAS TINY!! IM OLD AND NEED BIG LETTERS.
B008133DO8|5.0|I can honestly say this is one of the best acted, directed, and shot television series I have seen in a while.  The 90 minute length of each episode allows you to really get into the story and Cumberbatch does a fantastic job putting his own spin on Sherlock.

B0071BGOJC|5.0|Absolutely loved the book, it was a great follow on from the 1st book and I enjoyed seeing how both the characters in the 1st and second book were impacted by what was happening around the world. It is so interesting to hear what happened 70 years ago, and from such a different perspective than the usual museum tour or history book, and this book is both enjoyable and educational (Ken Follet claims it is historically accurate). Can't wait for the third!!

I had no expectations other than always enjoying his writing style, when I started reading, and Iloved it from start to finish. Albom's perspective of time and how it is valued in people's lives throughout time makes a very enlightening book with food for thought.

B0013LKFVO|5.0|I bought this as a replacement to my 12v Milwaukee flashlight.  I got the Milwaukee light as part of a drill pack and I was very disappointed with the bulb.  It was very yellow and very soft- almost of no use.  I dropped this bulb in and the difference was great.  The color of the light is much better for technical needs and looking through cabinets of different colored wire.  The run time is amazing!  I do not have a before to compare to the after- but on a full charge of one of the 12v batteries, the light has been running for 13 hours straight.  I use this light as an emergency light and this bulb fits the need.<br /><br />I will note, this bulb is designed for a flashlight that can focus its beam.  My flashlight does not have this feature thus the bulb casts the full image which will appear as if you had a mag light set for the widest setting (really big blank ring in the center).  So if you need a tight focus, this bulb is not for you on non focusing flashlights.

0790734850|5.0|I have seen this movie on the big screen years ago. I have watched it on my video many many times over. It's nice to have it as a DVD as a keepsake ! Had to wait some ten days for it to be mailed to me though ! The product is good.  As for the movie : Top performances by all actors and actresses involved. Kim Basinger gor her Oscar for Supporting actress. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe later on got their shares of Oscars. Not enough credits were given to Guy Pearce then and to this day. ( Can one imagine the success of L.A Confidential without agent Huxley ? And what about James Cromwell's \\"Chief of Detectives\\" Dudley Smith ?, and the \\"QT guy\\" Danny DeVito e al ? )\\" For those movie fans who love thrillers of the \\"L.A. Confidential\\" type, ( personally I haven't seen anything that good ever since ) just one copy of this DVD at home is enough for the genre, in my humble opinion !<br />Tee Newin
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am not finished reading this book but what I have read I find very, very  interesting.  The training these men have to go through is just unbelievable.  They do it for us - to keep us & our country safe. They fight for us to be free. These men are the real heroes!!!

B000TYWAUA|5.0|300 is an action movie's action movie. It starts with action and it just never really stops. Great Movie, Good Acting<br />Some of the special effects as to the misshapen characters of the evading army are a little to Lord of Rings looking and totally take away the reality of this having been an actual battle.
B007SXB498|3.0|This could be considered boring by anyone who liked action books; however, it is written in Jane Austen's usual form and deals with a time when ladies were considered to be protected by the gentlemen from anything that might be in the least distasteful or less than proper.  I found myself wishing it could move at a faster pace, but considering the period of time it was written, overall it was an interesting read.

B0034G4OYA|5.0|Well I just got back from the midnight showing of this film and I have to say that it was actually quite funny with Dracula (Adam Sandler) and the Wolfman (Steve Buscemi) being the two outstanding characters in this film. Of course Mavis Dracula (Selena Gomez), Count Dracula's daughter, Frankenstein (Kevin James), and human Jonathan (Andy Samberg), also turn in very funny performances but Sandler and Buscemi are still the best. The animation is good, but nothing along the lines of any of the Pixar films, but then again who is!<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is that Count Dracula's daughter, Mavis, is turning 118 years old and wants to leave home and go out and explore the world. However, her father is afraid of humans and fears for his daughter's safety. Therefore, he devises a plan to keep her at home and safe under his watchful eye. Meanwhile, monsters of all kinds and from every possible part of the planet come to Hotel Transylvania for a safe vacation and to help celebrate Mavis' upcoming birthday, and that's where things take a turn for the worse. Enter Jonathan, a 21 year old human male who accidentally finds himself at the hotel after hearing rumors of it's existence in a nearby village. Of course hilarious hi-jinks ensue as Dracula feverishly attempts to keep Jonathan's status as a human hidden from everyone's perception by passing him off as a Frankenstein, a sixth cousin thrice removed to the original Frankenstein's right arm. I'll give you a minute there to figure that one out.<br /><br />This seems to work out okay except for the fact that his daughter Mavis has now felt the \\"zing\\" when she first saw Jonathan as did he. Can't have a good animated monster movie without the obligatory love story. Anyhow, chaos ensues with various monsters and there are a lot of funny scenes that will definitely go over the heads of the younger crowd, but the teens and adults in the movie will probably pick most of the subtle adult oriented humor up pretty easily. Although nothing that a parent would really have to worry about as I am quite sure the younger crowd will miss most if not all of the adult directed humor and will instead focus more on the variety of cool looking monsters and juvenile humor.<br /><br />One of the many things that I found really funny was how the writers created an exact opposite outlook on humans as monsters from the monsters point of view, which mirror imaged everything we as humans learned about monsters. Kind of funny how that seems to imitate real-life at times.<br /><br />Be sure and pay real close attention for the part of the movie where they really slam the \\"Twilight\\" series (Hint: It is towards the end of the movie). That alone was worth the cost of the ticket!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|good for entertainment. cute games.  I enjoy them and my 3 year old can also play some.  only negative is that some games feel more like luck than game playing.
B005LAII8A|5.0|Well I just got back from a special screening of this movie and I have to say that not only was I not disappointed in this movie, but I actually really enjoyed it. I initially had mixed feelings on this film but decided to go ahead and check it out primarily because of the appearance of actors Bruce Willis as \\"Old\\" Joe and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as \\"Young\\" Joe in the film. And let me tell you that neither actor disappointed me as both performances were very good with Levitt actually, in my opinion, turning in a great performance and literally stole every scene in the movie and has surely cemented himself as a potential A-Lister in the near future. It should also be noted that there was quite a bit of fanfare concerning the make-up process to make Levitt actually appear to be a younger version of Willis, but I really didn't see it being all that pervasive throughout the movie. Sure there were a couple of scenes where the make-up really came across well, but generally overall I didn't real;y think that it made that much of a difference. Just another case in point where brilliant acting will trump special effects every time. Well, at least for those of us that appreciate it.<br /><br />Now that isn't to say that the other actors in the film didn't do a good job, because they did and in doing so made the movie even that much better. However, there were some additional stand-out performances from Jeff Daniels as Abe the Mafia boss, Emily Blunt as Sara, and perhaps one of the creepiest little kids since Harvey Stevens as Damien from the original [[ASIN:B000EYK4KS The Omen]] film, Pierce Gagnon as Cid. That creepy performance from that little kid is going to give me nightmares for the next couple of weeks.<br /><br />Now I will not give out any spoilers, but I will try and give you the basic synopsis of the movie without revealing to much, but if I do I apologize in advance.<br /><br />Levitt's character \\"Joe\\" is a looper, which is a fancy term for an assassin in the year 2072 who is tasked with time-traveling, which by the way is illegal, 30 years into the past to the year 2042 in order to eliminate someone from the future. The primary reason why they travel into the past in order to eliminate their target is because in the year 2072 it is a lot more difficult to dispose of a body that it is 30 years earlier. Their preferred method of doing this is to bind and blindfold the intended target before sending him back to the year 2042 where a looper is waiting to kill him immediately upon his arrival. Now what the loopers don't know is that when the Mafia is done with them they are also sent back to the year 2042 where the younger version of their current self is tasked with killing them. Kind of like a off-beat creepy form of suicide in one respect. Yes, I know it can be a bit confusing, but that's part of the unique aspect of this film.<br /><br />This is the exact situation that Levitt as \\"Young\\" Joe finds himself in when he is tasked with eliminating his older self, Willis as \\"Old\\" Joe. Only things don't quite go according to the Mafia's and Young Joe's plans, and hence the major plot point of the movie. Now remember I said the major plot point as there are a whole bunch of cool plot twists that will have your head reeling by the end of the movie.<br /><br />Now please do yourself a monumental favor and don't go into this movie looking for everything to make perfect sense because if you do we will see a couple of things that don't make any sense at all and that will ruin the movie for you. Suspend disbelief and simply watch this movie to be entertained and don't look at it from a technical standpoint. I use to have that problem with fight scenes and firearms and it just got to frustrating seeing the ridiculous confrontations taking place that literally have no basis in reality. So relax the old grey matter and simply view this film as it is intended and that is as entertainment, not anything based in reality.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

I thoroughly enjoyed just about every moment of the story - but one. I think that instead of having the narrator of the last chapter be some unknown third person, it should be narrated by the little boy Enzo who is the reincarnated dog Enzo. It would give the book more continuity.

B008C1O8CA|4.0|This isn't their best album. But how could it be? After their most recent successes, it just wasn't going to happen.<br />However, it is a decent album and worth the price of admission. It certainly didn't dissuade me from pre-ordering ¡Dos! which is coming out in November.<br /><br />After listening to it the second time through, there's a few catchy tunes. My favorites are Troublemaker and Spend the night. There's also a few bland songs, but I just skip over those.<br />I expect ¡Dos! will have a harder edge to it.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|I have had my Invicta for several months now and I can say it has been working flawlessly!  It looks great, large and chunky which is what I like. The band is soft and well made, and easy to get on and off. The buttons on the left are a great idea, it means you can flex your left wrist a lot better than if the buttons jut into your wrist. It would also be ideal for a left handed wearer, and even though I am left handed I still wear it on the traditional side.<br /><br />The glass is quite robust, no scratches yet, and the case feels very well made. For the price $99, it is a bargain, since it matches Swatch quality quite easily but feels more solid, and I get a lot of looks with it.  I love the red second hand, and the Breitling style face.<br /><br />Negatives, I did briefly have some condensation showing inside it when I was at high altitude, however otherwise I can't complain. I also would prefer a matt (not glossy) logo on the watch face.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!

B009B50QOU|1.0|. . . of overhyped, self-indulgent, pretentious pseudo-rock twaddle. Green Day is to music as \\"Close cover before striking\\" is to literature. This is the music of a generation raised in the cult of self-esteem, where EVERYTHING you do is simply wonderful, and don't let any old meany-pants wet blankets tell you otherwise. They had a couple decent songs early on, but this is just sad. There isn't a shade of ironic self-awareness that they should all have put their instruments up on Ebay years ago, and found good jobs selling replacement windows, or at least started some classes at ITT Tech.<br /><br />Don't just avoid spending money to buy/download this album, if any songs come on the radio, switch the station instantly to one playing some substantive music, like Kidz Bop.
B007WUV302|5.0|Carefully constructed, highly musical, highly lyrical - it's like an amazing soundtrack to a movie, full of motion and emotion, without all the distracting shreds or poppy catches.<br /><br />In a world where everyone is a musical genius, this would still be a pretty great album. In a world where all music is the same boring pop song, this is a welcome break.

As a tough-minded male, this movie brought me to the verge of tears several times and there were a few instances where I couldn't hold back the floodgates.

0451228731|3.0|Before a computer genius dies of cancer, he hacks into systems around the globe, embedding a daemon (software running in the background, performing operations at defined times or in response to certain events). When the genius dies, the daemon ruthlessly destroys property, kills people, and recruits followers to fulfill the plans of the dead man.<br /><br />Suarez's prose is easy to read, he has a hard-hitting imagination, and his characters attract readers' sympathy. But as with many entries in the suspense-thriller genre, too much focus is devoted to action. And, as usual, lengthy and repeated sequences of action for the sake of action become boring. I would rather have more pages devoted to politics, intrigue, mystery, and parallel storylines.<br /><br />Also, though many readers consider this story frighteningly believable, I was not a believer. In two regards. One, much of the technology was unconvincing, and the sophisticated automation would have required a longer time of development than Suarez allows for. Two, some of the American officials are just too doggone ruthless. Specifically I do not believe that real American officials would do what the fictional ones did to one of the story's good guys (identifying the good guy would spoil the story). And the fictional Major was too cold-heartedly lethal.<br /><br />In summation, this novel has unconvincing aspects and a surfeit of action. On the other hand, villains were intense, I could identify with good guys, and technology was imaginative. Therefore an average rating.

0307743659|5.0|\\"The Shining\\" by Stephen King is set in the spacious confines of the luxurious Overlook Hotel.  The Taurence family experience a slow decent into madness instead of the quiet getaway they had planned.  This hotel had secrets of murder, mob deals and tragedy that are weaved liberally into a page turning mesh of horror and suspense.<br /> Based on the Stanley Hotel in Colorado, King has given us a mind bending foray into the respectful boy Danny and his relationship with his father Jack.  Is a history of binge drinking and violence towards little Danny and his wife Wendy the only dangers that loom in the bowels of Jack's mind?

Not all other companies like Netfilx and others do that. The video selection is useful and simple. No need for complicated options, just click on the episode and it starts. Love the auto-play function and the episodes get better as the season goes by. Would love to see a scene selection option or a subtitles or audio option. Besides that the product is great, no need to look anywhere else for this product. Amazon gives you top quality for your money. I highly recommend this product.
030758836X|1.0|The ending of this book was so full of holes it was swiss cheese!<br />1. How could Amy get pregnant so fast with invitro insemination treatments especially at her age -- these treatments do not have such good outcomes as this; usually the first insemination does not work and sometime they never work (especially considering her age) - but, of course it works for her the very first time and on the first day of her return!!!<br />2. These invitro insemination treatments must have the consent of the husband and cost thousands of dollars AT THE TIME OF THE PROCEDURE, neither of which Amy had;<br />3. It would have been very easy for Desi's mother to have established Desi's whereabouts during all the time that Amy was missing and prove that Desi was not responsible for kidnapping her;<br />4. Why didn't the two thieves show up and disprove where Amy had been -- why didn't the landlady show and up disprove where Amy had been;<br />5. It was at 20 weeks that Amy told Nick that she was pregnant - that would have meant that she would have had to have gotten pregnant (through invitro treatment)IMMEDIATELY UPON HER RETURN in order to already know the sex of her baby, and for the invitro treatment to have worked THE FIRST TIME!!! Also, she would have been showing by that time and Nick would have known by looking at her that she was pregnant and she wouldn't have had to \\"pee on a stick\\" to prove it;<br />6. Also, since she was \\"being raped every day by Desi\\" while she was gone, wouldn't Nick want to prove that this baby was his before giving in to her demands?

B007URVZJ6|2.0|As a first-time book writer, I find that the format required by CreateSpace for a print book does not easily convert to the format required by Kindle.  So when I came across, \\"Building your Book for Kindle,\\" I was relieved, thinking that my difficulties were over.  I was wrong; they were just beginning.  This book is written like an auto repair manual, telling the reader what it assumes is necessary, but leaving out basic, yet important information.<br /><br />For example, I wanted to know if any specific size page or type font was required; neither was even mentioned.  Ouch.<br /><br />I wanted to know about any special instructions for converting from a CreareSpace format to a Kindle format; never mentioned.  Ouch.<br /><br />I wanted to know if the pages needed to follow a specific formatting formula.  Again, no mention.  Ouch.<br /><br />I wanted to see what a well-formatted Kindle book could look like, assuming this would be it.  Not even close.  This book used a font with each letter about the size of a gnat's eyelash.  I literally needed to read it with a magnifying glass.  And every few paragraphs, there would a note in gray that said, \\"42 [or some other number] highlighters.\\" I have no idea what that is all about, but I suspect it is not supposed to be there.  Ouch, ouch, ouch.<br /><br />That said, and most importantly, I cannot take seriously a book about formatting that is itself formatted poorly.  Doctor, heal thyself.<br /><br />Some sections were unclear, and I ended with more questions than I had before reading this.  I was looking for a book about Kindle formatting written by someone with practical experience, and written in such a way as to clearly address the kinds of questions and issues a newbie faces.  Unfortunately, this is not it.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because nothing is all bad, and I will be the first to admit that there are some good pointers in here... I just got tired of looking for them with a magnifier.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee child keeps the his coming.  Finally caught up with all the prior books and can hardly wait for the next one.  Amazon, keep me informed on the next installment in this great series.
0792844890|5.0|Bwaaahahaha... This is the fourth time I have owned this movie. This is and will always be one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. True Classic. If I had to buy this again I would in a heartbeat.
B008J34466|5.0|This is by far my favorite P!nk CD in her entire career. There's upbeat pop songs, and slower, more personal songs as well. I don't think I've listened to a CD on repeat so many times before.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is a great quality and looking product for my new Kindle Fire 2. After three attempts at trying different covers this one is a keeper and highly reccomended.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I've spent many hours playing both this and their follow up game,  Quell Reflect.  Both are well worth the purchase.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really liked this book. Great writing, was very attached to the characters. I don't give 5s often... so in my charts it's in my top ten this year!
B003THN75G|5.0|I have found all episodes of Castle to be exellent.  I have not only bought all four DVD's but also have them as a part of my video library and can watch them at anytime and anywhere.  Really looking forward to season 5.
0553801473|1.0|I got a few chapters into this book and couldn't do it.  I loved Game of Thrones, CLash of Kings, Storm of Swords, and was a bit disapointed with Crows.  Now I've completely lost interest.  For some reason many Fantasy authors feel like their epics most contain hundreds of minor character threads and continue on for 10,000 pages.  When I read GoT I was blown away, important stuff actually happened.  I was maybe a few hundred pages into ADwD when I realized that nothing was happening, I couldn't keep all of these people in my head, and I just didn't care what happened.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Follows the book ok. Love the different characters. Not so much the acting. Glad I didn't spend top dollar at the movie house.
B008FTAAG2|1.0|This album is similar to Metallica's Saint Anger. Sure, it has it's good points, but for those of us that were looking for In This Moment, we didn't get it. This album marks a new turn for In This Moment down a road that I wish they had never taken. When I heard Blood before the release, I thought it would be like Gun Show, a single song that I could simply skip. It wasn't. The album is everything that The Dream, A Star-Crossed Wasteland and Beautiful Tragedy.<br /><br />If you like this, you likely will not like In This Moments other albums, instead, let me recommend Huntress. If you don't like this, you may like their older albums, which were similar to Straight Line Stitch.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Not the greatest of movies, but worth watching. I'm not a big fan of Rhihanna and was skepticle about her being in this movie but she pulled it off.

B008OTTRXU|3.0|I loved her EP, and this CD is OK. I am a rock fan and normally don't listen to POP, but I like Carly Rae's music. This CD however, shows the influence of the record companies. Instead of her usual great voice and clean music, this is mixed to death and ruined a couple of her fantastic songs. The remixes aren't worth the money and the CD is overmixed destroying the integrity of the work. Carly Rae it seems has sold out to Bieber and manager to come up with a mediocre CD after one of the best EP's I have heard in a long time. I suggest getting the EP and leaving this alone.
B00846REIS|5.0|Addicted!<3 Im completely in love with this book. Im more than excited for the next book and im sure my husband is slightly jelouse.
B0099G3I96|5.0|After numerous listens I can say I love this new No Doubt album, and I was a fan since their debut album seventeen years ago in 1995 came out. I understand some fans feel this isn't what they were expecting, but come on artists grow and evolve. You can't do or make the same music forever. Like Madonna, and other artists before them they are maturing and I for one am happy to be on this journey with them. It's so rare now days to find a album that you can listen to from start to finish and actually enjoy. This is an album right up there with the new Madonna and Alanis Morissette Albums, where you can listen to it from start to finish and (with the exception of a few songs) really enjoy it. The deluxe edition of Push and Shove sold at target comes with a total of 19 tracks with the last few being acoustic and remixes which make the album that much better. The whole album is amazing, but the stand out tracks are the beautiful Undone, Easy, One More Summer, Push and Shove, Gravity, Undercover, Sparkle, Heaven, and Dreaming The Same Dream. I highly recommend this amazing album. It's great to hear quality music in a world that plays the same old disposable crap. Thanks No Doubt for giving me music that I can enjoy and that will last the test of time.<br /><br />No Doubt Push and Shove deluxe edition sold at target.<br />1. Settle Down 0:06:01<br />2.

034580404X|5.0|If you can make it through the first book, the rest are better. The story gets better as the characters are developed. The books are a quick, fun read. They are silly, romantic, not everyones cup of tea but I enjoyed them.

B005LAIHSQ|1.0|I had fun reading a few of the reviews just now, because others are really getting the same things I got from this poor excuse for a movie! I too have avoided ANYTHING Twilight, and especially Kristin Stewart, but also like others, the pretty kick ass trailer made me decide to give it-and Stewart- a chance.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />My favorite part was at the very end, when walking out of the theater, hearing all the other people making fun of the exact same flaws I had seen. I agree, Theron was very cool, and I wanted to like Hemsworth even more than I could, because yes- he was given a part far beneath his talents.<br /><br />But back to the *star* of the show. Cardboard cutout with a pretty face! Oh yes. Seriously, did anyone else notice the 99.9% of the time that her character's mouth hung partly open-I'm assuming in what was supposed to resemble a sexy pout-to me it came off more like a dog that is too hot in the summer. And also...the chest heaving...really? I kept expecting the poor pale princess to go into an asthmatic attack throughout the film.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the \\"kiss\\" scene; I understand (sort of) why they did it that way, but I had really hoped to see an exceptionally rousing, possibly romantic scene that was powerful and emotional. Instead we get kiss. Leave. Chest begins to heave. Mouth pops open and the dead rises.<br /><br />And finally, our theater too was full of laughter at the princess' \\"rousing\\" speech. I was laughing pretty hard, because it was such an epic failure! I was thinking, and could imagine the Huntsman thinking it too \\"Yeah we get it already-and the only reason we're listening to you is because you 'rose' from the dead. You're welcome btw...\\" I just wanted her to shut up so we could see everyone else fight.<br /><br />I think the final scene was a perfect picture encompassing not only the movie in it's entirety, but also Kristin Stewart's acting career. She is seated on a throne that no watcher (myself & obviously a few others at least) felt like she deserved...Now we get to zoom in on that pretty-albeit slightly blank-face....oh look! Mouth open...chest heaving...anyone got that inhaler ready?bviously a few others at least) felt like she deserved...Now we get to zoom in on that pretty-albeit slightly blank-face....oh look!

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a nice relaxing time blower.  good when trying to fall asleep.  its enough excitement without having to purchase more coins for the most part.
B008NW67E0|5.0|In a musical sea of auto-tunes and synthesized mumbo-jumbo, it is always pleasant to hear music that returns to the roots, much like this particular genre does, with other great bands like The Avett Brothers, The Lumineers and Old Crow Medicine Show growing immensely in popularity.<br /><br />Being a fan of M&S since early 2010, I had very high expectations for this album. Needless to say, somehow Marcus Mumford and his musical talent landed nowhere remotely close to disappointment. From beginning to end, this album is beautiful and hits its highs and lows at all the right times. Marcus hold nothing back in the opening track (Babel) and through each track he paints a vivid picture that seems to lean quite heavily on the \\"faith and religion\\" motif, not unheard of from M&S but it seems like something is weighing more on his heart, which in turn creates one of the best albums I've heard in years.<br /><br />And also to note, it's worth getting the Deluxe Edition. The Boxer cover is fantastic and the sultry sounds of \\"Where Are You Now\\" is a soothing end to a great work of art.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I really like this app because u can download music to ur music place on ur Kindle Fire but ive had it for like 2 months, and now it wont let me download music...... weird!
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Having not read any of the books, I watched this film with an open mind, when I heard Jennifer Lawrence was in it. She is one of our greatest new actors. I was sadly disappointed. Hardly any back story to set up the reason for the games. No character development for the 24 contestants. Peetas' hair style changes 8 times in the first half hour. So much for continuity. And the hand held camera movements during the battles, were done intentionally, to keep the bloodless battles PG13. An obvious ploy to garner the kid market. 'Battle Royale', a violent Japanese flick that came out about 10 years ago, had the same premise, so the idea is certainly not new. Whatever reasons for the hunger games, is just not translated in the film. Hence, we dont feel very much for the characters. Although Jennifer Lawrence gives it her all in a good performance, most of the other characters are quite laughable. Peeta is portrayed as a whiny wuss. It is difficult to transcribe any novel into a film, but it would have been interesting, to have seen this movie directed, lets say, by the late Tony Scott. I am sure we would have had quite a different vision. I would pass on this film. Although, I am now interested in reading the novel. For sheer entertainment, and to watch a great artist at work, please witness Jennifer Lawrence's performance in WINTERS BONE.
B000007ODL|4.0|This is an excellent 1-disc compilation of J.J. Cale's work. He's a vastly underrated Southern blues-man and rocker and should get more recognition than he does, but that's another topic. Let's just say that if you want a \\"Best Of\\" of his work, then these 20 songs should not disappoint. J.J. has so many other great tunes though, so I would recommend getting all of his albums or perhaps one of his anthologies rather than this limited collection. I only take off a star because The Very Best does not encompass all of his great work. His subtle musicianship and laid-back vocals are amazing and there are many hidden treasures. Looking back, I'd collect all of his albums from his first to his last. If I wanted a comprehensive body of Cale's work in a single package, I'd pick up [[ASIN:B000JGF1DQ J.J Cale - Collected]] (the re-mastering is amazing too). For a one-disc collection however, this is hard to top and a great introduction to this master musician.<br /><br />~ Kort

B00006CXSS|5.0|My neighbor has this movie set, and let me borrow it for a while to watch.  I have to say, I have seen a number of movies, documentaries, and depictions of World War 2 and Band of Brothers is hands down the best I have ever seen.  The acting in this movie is outstanding, and many of the scenes seem so real that at times you forget you are watching a movie.  We have all seen movies that have a cast which is largely unknown and lacks star power, yet delivers.  This movie exactly fits that type of film.  One of the reasons why this movie is called Band of Brothers is because of the comradory that develops between the men of easy company.  The men who play the soldiers of easy company do a great job of showing how such a strong bond can develop in a time where the only thing to lean on are the men next to you.  One of the most powerful aspects of this movie is how well it portrays the harsh realities of war.  The violence, hardships, and even celebratory times are all included in this movie in a very realistic way.  The Bottom line is, this movie, although not live footage, gives viewers the most unique inside look at war to date.
B009DP9D6A|4.0|I am not into this kind of music, until less than a year ago, so any terminology, and lingo or jargon that pertains to this kind of music - I don't know it. I don't need to know it. I just know I like this. I've never like anything \\"dance\\" my whole life. I listened to Nine in Nails, but that's about as techno as I go. But I saw Deadmau5 play with Foo Fighters last year, and that got me hooked. I loved this album. I don't think it is as good as Random Album Title, however, it is still quite amazing. I can't stop listening to it on repeat.<br />The only song I absolutely dislike is Failbait with Cypress Hill. I have never been a fan of them, and I deleted that song from my playlist. My favorite songs on the album are Professional Griefers and fn pig. Both are outstanding songs.<br />So, I suppose this isn't much of a review as it is just my opinion coming from a guy that would prefer metal over this music, but with that said, deadmau5 has turned me on to a new kind of music. He is the master of this craft. And this cd is a perfect example!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this set of free games is a great time killer. some of the games are relatively easy and some seem to be a bit more difficult. loads easily and I have yet to find any glitches with it. I can say that some of the more difficult games may be due to the slow reaction time of finger swipes to move the object in a few of the games. not sure if that is kindle related or not.

B001DPC52C|5.0|I really love this album! If you're a fan of both classical and rock/metal, then you will want to give this one a try. It's by far, in my opinion, one of Within Temptation's best albums. It highlights their most known songs in a fresh, epic way that will keep you listening for hours. The CD/DVD set came brand new as described, and the CD plays perfectly fine, no scratches or skips. I haven't tried out the DVD yet, but I venture to say it will be just fine.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|\\"Lucky\\" is Alice Sebold's ironically titled rape narrative. Her blunt and frank recall of her assault are daunting but - as she notes - she is \\"lucky\\" to have survived. While not for the faint-hearted her story is important. I recommend it to a broad readership because it poses questions about violence, family, law, punishment and recovery. I liked the truth of this biography and its pacing. Although there is another rape narrative near the end, it added nothing to strengthen the core theme; the book would have done well without it.<br /><br />Personalized, micro-histories of this sort offer valuable opportunities to understand, interpret and feel what are too often vague, anonymous news articles. Sebold's direct style courageously stares this kind of crime straight in the eye without blinking. It is a solid read and a valuable story.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Being a 72-year-old WASP grandma, I am hardly the target audience for this product. However, when it is finally done playing later this year, I don't know what will serve as its equal in talented writing, directing, acting, production and just plain off-the-wall enthralling viewing. It's such a game of chess, a cat-and-mouse chase, twisted and perverse often, edge-of-the-seat viewing which frequently left me cheering or, alternately, cringing. Walter and Gus are both brilliant minds, trading the upper hand. One knows Gus is corrupt and one sees that Walter is becoming more and more so, digging himself in deeper and deeper until you cannot imagine a way out for him. Supporting them is a cast of diverse characters, each with good and evil qualities but to a much lesser degree than Walter and Gus. It is my hands-down favorite piece of writing EVER.  By the end of its run, I will own the whole set, most of them acquired thru Amazon. Wouldn't part with them for anything.
B004SBX112|5.0|This Angry Birds AD free was pretty involved. I didn't have to continue back spacing to get the stupid adverting off my game. I dislike being interrupted when my mind is into a game of skill. That's what it takes to beat the Birds. Some of the steps are easier than other but its all good. I enjoyed this game too.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I enjoyed reading a Wanted Man - it was entertaining and kept my attention. I was a little worried that it wouldn't live up to my expectations after reading some of the reviews and wondered if I shouldn't bother with it, but lucky I didn't listen to them!  This was a good story and I think if you enjoy other Lee Chold books you will enjoy this one!

B00008G8LG|2.0|Jody Foster was just so terribly miscast in this. Apparently she thought acting this role was pursing up her mouth all the time.  Instead of sticking to the story they threw in battles which, of course, Ms Foster helps to win.  The whole thing was ridiculous.  She never unbends from her starchiness at all and it gets very tiring and boring. I guess they thought a handsome king and gorgeous dresses would satisfy everybody.  I read the book many years ago, have seen the original 40s movie many times and, of course, The King and I many times. This version is pathetic.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|wow. i saw this film today. growing up in the late 80s my dad always played his music. i just presumed he was famous around the world. this superb film certainly gets it right. too often these music documentaries fall short, this one captures the magic of an incredibly humble and talented man and tells the story of the mystery that surrounded him with such perfect shots and home video footage.

1439102732|1.0|I bought this book because I am going through a rough time with infertility and thought maybe reading about someone elses journey would help. I guess I was kind of looking for a book that was sympathetic with women who have problems with infertility and the hard struggle it is for a couple. I will admit that I cried through the first chapter or so because it really hit home. I couldn't put the book down and ended up reading almost 200 pages in the first sitting. Then the story turns in to a story about lesbians. When I think ifertility, I think of a male and female that have all the right parts but can't seem to get them to work, not gay lovers looking to have a child. I wish I had read some of the reviews about this book before I wasted my time. This is my first and last book I will be reading by her.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This book is difficult to read because of all the grammatical errors. The simple misuse of words like your and you're and multiple typing errors made me put the book down uninterested in finishing. There is also almost an entire page that is repeated before the book continues. The author should stick to private journaling until she can compose coherent thoughts and the editor should be fired.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|Yes Alawar should have just originally charged $1.99rather than a &quot;come on&quot; .99 cents but this is a fun game.  It's just $1.99 still reasonable for this caliber of game. Chill people.

030758836X|5.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" is a Hitchcock-level psychological thriller that combines a riveting analysis of a struggling marriage with a made-for-media crime investigation. At the center of the drama are Nick and Amy Dunne, who link their respective families. The family members - both sets of parents and Nick's twin, Margo - are completely believable. Each also contributes, mostly unconsciously, in some way to the marital discord. Flynn shows a big talent for easily switching between Nick's male voice and Amy's female voice. Through both voices, the reader gets to know them better than they - or at least Nick - know the other. Nick knows that Amy is the smartest person in the room; but, until she disappears on their fifth anniversary, he doesn't comprehend the extent of her bold intelligence. Nick is an almost quick learner, and watching his awareness develop is the most interesting part of the storyline. The plot is intriguing and new. Even minor characters with a few lines are described so well that the reader feels right in the room with them. By the end, I had one cavil: the closing is over the top. After finishing the book, I mulled over this unexpected and extreme climax and resolution. Then, I realized that this ending is extraordinary in its consistency with everything that had happened up to that point. It really couldn't have turned out any other way. \\"Gone Girl\\" is a brilliant must-read. The suspense doesn't stop with the last page.

B005LAII8A|4.0|The masses will be disappointed. The trailer misrepresents the experience. There is action, blood and guts. But this is smart SF. One needs to bring a functioning brain. Because the real story is about a mother's love, or lack thereof. All actors do an excellent job. Scenes are stolen with understated professionalism.  This is really good. Some pacing issues. But a really smart, entertaining, thought provoking film.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It took me a while, but I've finally finished Fifty Shades of Grey and... I don't even know where to start. How about, what on earth is wrong with women?! How is this book a best seller! I just can't wrap my head around it. Fifty Shades sounds like it was written by a 13-year-old who got into mom and dad's porn collection.<br /><br />I have never seen so many adjectives in my LIFE. Nor have I read anything that uses the same words so often over and over and over. Some words I never want to read again, ever, include: tenacity/tenacious, inquisition, intimidating/intimidated, long (fingers.. What the..?), arrogant/arrogance, oh my, crap (Double crap! Triple crap! Holy crap! Oh crap! All kinds of crap!!), holy (Holy crap?), oh no, behind (Is there no other word for your back side?), shattering (All kinds of \\"shattering\\" orgasms, because heaven knows that's the only sort), baby (\\"Laters, baby\\".. Coming from a billionaire? No.), bossy, control freak, jeez (Really? Jeez?), anything about eyes (burning, smoldering, molten, intense, bright, gray, blaze, etc), fifty shades (OF ANYTHING), fire up (Her laptop? Her phone? Google?!), medulla oblongata (Yes, you read that right), foil packet (We get it -- Christian wears protection), wow/whoa, scarlet, hitch/es, gasp/s, whisper/s, murmur/s... Not to mention the word \\"all\\", as in [he/she/it's] all [adjective], [adjective], and [adjective]. This seems to be a favorite of E L James, I'm guessing because she gets to use even MORE adjectives.<br /><br />Should I even start on how Ana thinks and speaks? \\"Get a grip, Steele\\" (How many times does she need to think this?), \\"I square my shoulders in an attempt to look taller and more intimidating\\" (?!?!), \\"I'm tied, literally, to my bed, and I'm so aroused\\" (How... literal), \\"...and I come instantly again and again, falling apart beneath him as he continues to slam deliciously into me\\" (EVERY sex scene is like this, never ending orgasms and a lot of slamming. Not much else, but it must benice to orgasm on command!), \\"I rarely wear makeup--it intimidates me\\" (beware the Cosmetic Monster..), \\"I didn't know I could dream sex. Was it something I ate?\\" (I... what?), and possibly my favorite-- \\"Poor, [expletive]ed-up, kinky, philanthropic Christian\\", for which I have NO WORDS.<br /><br />The immaturity level in this book is depressing. I mean, really: \\"He grins, leaps up off the bed, and pulls on his jeans--no underwear!\\" (How shocking, no underwear! That's really risqué, is it?). Not to mention the pig tails.. Ugh. Ana refers to her laptop as \\"the mean machine\\", like she's seventy? Yet she calls her vagina either \\"down there\\" or \\"my sex\\" (\\"he runs his hands over my sex\\" ...). The way Ana thinks of sex and her body makes me feel like a pedophile at times; not a great vibe for \\"erotic\\" fiction. It seems to me like a bad case of an author trying to write about sex, when in fact she is quite uncomfortable writing about sex. Midlife crisis for sure.<br /><br />Ana is spineless and devoid of any personality. Are we supposed to believe that a girl who is just graduating college is A) a virgin, B) doesn't know what masturbation is, C) has never been drunk, D) doesn't own a computer, and E) has never had an email address? In 2011? Hm. Aside from those things, she has some serious issues with self-esteem. Everything \\"intimidates\\" her -- make-up, blondes, blondes in \\"sharp\\" suits, her best fri--sorry, Katherine Kavanagh, Christian Grey, any place that's \\"fancy\\", etc, etc. Call me crazy, but I think we need a stronger heroine for girls and women out there. Not some ridiculously innocent and naive woman child like Ana.<br /><br />Speaking of her innocence... How are we supposed to believe that Ana goes from completely inexperienced virgin to getting instantly turned on just by thinking about Christian's \\"gaze\\"? She squeezes her thighs together at every little thing. She's wet just thinking about him, every second of every day. And on that note, how is she able to observe how \\"wet\\" she is, when she doesn't even know what masturbation is? Someone please solve that mystery for me.<br /><br />The sex scenes are boring. They are basically the same routine performed in different places, with maybe some light bondage and a couple of sex toys. Nothing to get excited about and I worry for the sex lives of the ladies out there who are hot and bothered by this book. If you want your husband to tie you up and spank you then by all means, go for it! It's nothing to be ashamed of like poor little Ana believes. Sex should be fun. It should not be something you feel dirty about, and you certainly shouldn't fear your partner. It's worrying to think that women want their men to read this for ideas.<br /><br />Then there's Christian, who is a controlling, condescending, possessive, psychotic jerk (I can overuse adjectives, too!). He is not romantic or sweet. This is a book about an abusive relationship that is masquerading as \\"BDSM\\". Their relationship is NOT consensual. Ana fears Christian, she repeatedly says so (\\"Please don't hit me\\" - Say what?). She is afraid to act like herself because she doesn't want to set him off and get punished. Her friends and family think she is acting odd, in the \\"hiding things\\" sort of way (still screaming \\"abusive relationship\\"...). Christian stalks her and invades her privacy, and she talks about it like it's a joke? E L James gives Christian some kind of \\"messed up\\" past and then uses that as the reason he is into BDSM (like normal people don't enjoy the lifestyle?). Ana believes that if she gives Christian whatever he wants, whenever and however he wants it, that she can drag him from the \\"dark\\". No, okay. JUST NO. First, it gives BDSM a bad rap. Second, and again, this is ABUSE. Stop kidding yourselves.<br /><br />I know a lot of people, and a lot of my friends, love these books. I cannot for the life of me figure it out. Just reading good reviews of Fifty Shades of Grey makes me want to collectively slap all the women who think this is literature. It's embarrassing.

B0000024JA|3.0|This album was ok the wu tang sound was cool and some of the verses were nice plus the wu tang guest spots save this album from being wack.Let me start ok by saying meth is the not one of the best lyrical members of wu but he has enjoyed mainstream success because of his delivery which is probably the best of the wu members.I actually like this album better that his future works before he sold out and started making garbage albums like redman and method man and his second album.If you like wu worth getting if you can get for under 5 dollars like I did.Otherwise not worth the money.

B008RYN44U|1.0|I could not wait to buy the new No Doubt CD. As a longtime fan of the band I can tell you this is NOT the No Doubt I remember. The tunes are unremarkable. Most of them lack any energy which was always their strong point. If you are looking for the \\"ska\\" music typical of their past songs there are 2 songs that barely try. Overall this CD was a huge disappointment. Listen to the samples at least before committing to any of the songs. Also, Settle Down is as good as the CD is going to get. And it's not that great compared to past CDs.
B0028NSE3M|5.0|When I was a senior in high school, 1970, I loved this album. Obviously, one of the greatest soul voices of all time, but what I loved was that on the whole album there were only four songs. Long songs. \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\\"--wow! Almost 20 minutes long.<br /><br />Well, there wasn't a very strong concert presence in Jackson, Mississippi at the time, but my aunt knew somebody who worked at the Coliseum, and we were able to get into the shows of the groups who actually came for free: I think the highlight had been the Grass Roots. Anyway, Isaac came. My friends and I were out of our minds to see this guy. When we got there, the place was empty. There weren't fifty people there. There were almost as many people performing because Isaac had--if my memory is any good--a full orchestra in addition to his band.<br /><br />The musicians were milling around, tuning up. No sign of Isaac. The lights started to go down and a man with a huge Afro came center stage and knelt down. The lights went out completely except for a single spot light on the kneeling man. Somebody stepped up and removed the wig and Isaac's head shone forth like the miracle of ages.<br /><br />They played for three hours. Five songs. Heaven.

0316228532|5.0|At the start of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, we meet the Dursleys, stodgy and small-minded and \\"proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.\\" J. K. Rowling loves poking fun of the self-absorbed from within their own heads, then zooming out and showing us their victims, for whom the cruelty of idiots is considerably less fun.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a story of fools suffering fools, and no one the better for it. Pagford is a beautifully-realized small town, and first we see it from privileged eyes: from the councillor, Barry Fairbrother, whose sudden death sets the tale in motion; from the Mollison family, a gossipy would-by political dynasty; from the girl-crazy Andrew and his friend Fats, who longs for an \\"authentic\\" lifestyle instead the comfortable one he's been given. Rowling knows how to write twits and teenagers - the passages of adolescent lust are hilariously accurate.<br /><br />Then we're brought to the lower-class housing project called the Fields, and to the Bellchapel Addiction Clinic: two parts of Pagford which the Mollisons think is a terrible inconvenience, and which Barry Fairbrother was trying to protect. And we're introduced to a few of its residents, trapped in a cycle of abuse and neglect from which there's no easy escape. Suddenly the fools aren't looking so amusing.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is chock full of comic details, but it wasn't a laugh-out-loud book, because the comedy always comes with something darker. It's most pronounced with the younger characters, whose ignorances can be breathtakingly cruel. Their youthful perspectives are hilariously well-rendered, even beautiful in their naivet&eacute; - but also shockingly malevolent, and we're shown time and again the victims of their nastiness. The unthinking pettiness of the older characters is funny too, but their conceit doesn't exist within a vacuum, and too often they miss the misery right in front of their faces, lost in daydreams of what they wish their lives could be.<br /><br />There's a thick cast of characters, but at the center of it all is Krystal Weedon, who lives in the Fields and whose mother gets treated on-and-off at the Bellchapel Clinic. Caught up in a world she doesn't quite understand, Krystal clings fiercely to her younger brother Robbie, as other kids take advantage of her and adults fail to give her the help she desperately needs. Only Barry Fairbrother, it seems, could think of a way to help her escape her perilous situation, but Barry's death leaves a vacancy that threatens to take Krystal from the only person she loves.<br /><br />And that, in a nutshell, is the tragedy at the center of this novel: people hurt in ways they cannot take care of on their own, and the only ones who might help them are too lost in their own misery to even notice their suffering. But The Casual Vacancy tells their stories with the light and warmth that suffused the Harry Potter series, and that makes all the difference - Rowling captures their comedy and their loveliness, and makes you hope for them, for (almost) all of them, even as you realize they won't all find what they're looking for. For all the darkness, for all the sorrow, there is magic here.<br /><br />This is a world you could get lost in, full of characters you'll come to understand and love. Just don't expect your love alone to save them - they fail to understand each other, and that leaves a vacancy which cannot be easily filled.ish their lives could be.<br /><br />There's a thick cast of characters, but at the center of it all is Krystal Weedon, who lives in the Fields and whose mother gets treated on-and-off at the Bellchapel Clinic.

B002NHBNWW|2.0|I tried. I really did try to like this show.  But after a certain amount of stereotypical vamp-angst, teen drama, and bad acting, I finally quit.  I gave it a fair chance--I think I quit 4 or 5 episodes in--but I just couldn't stand the level of the actors and even the script.  The plot is okay, I suppose. If you're really into high school (or IN high school) and really into vampires... go ahead.
0385344333|3.0|Waited for this book with great anticipation but......from all the reviews, think I'll wait until it ends up in a yard sale.  So disappointed!!!
B005HP2J66|4.0|I'll warn you guys, if you're not at least somewhat interested in the subject matter then you will probably be slightly bored throughout the film. It's an incredibly well done documentary but ultimately it's something that is made to inform rather than to be overly sensational. For some this will be a good thing, for others that want more entertainment than information (nothing wrong with that) you might want to look for a shorter film or google the information yourself. Just to alert readers, I viewed this via Netflix and didn't have access to all the features you'd receive on a DVD version.<br /><br />Given how limited the access to the cave was and the restrictions on the filming, what the crew was able to accomplish is amazing. The artwork is very lovingly filmed and highlighted, as the crew knew that this was likely the only chance any of them would get to enter the caves in their lifetimes and one of the few times that a film crew would be able to get in for such an extensive time period. They certainly made it count and the attention to detail filming the paintings gave me shivers to think about how old the paintings are and how detailed they are for the time period and materials. I can only imagine what it must have been like to actually be there during the filming!<br /><br />The soundtrack was also fairly nice, with the music meshing in well for the most part. My only complaint is that it was pretty loud at times and would be fairly overwhelming on a superior sound system. On my basic TV it was fairly booming, so people with kick rump sound systems beware. As far as the narration goes, I'm not really an expert on the Chauvet Cave so I can't entirely vouch on how accurate it all is, but the crew did know what they were doing and made everything pretty easy to understand for the beginner.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this video and for people looking to expand their knowledge about cave paintings, either for class or for personal pleasure, this will be a good place to turn to. Is it worth purchasing? Well, that's where I kind of falter. If you are really, really into this sort of thing then it might be. I enjoyed this and would recommend it to people, but I don't know that I'd really watch this enough to warrant purchasing it via just re-selecting it via Netflix.e a good place to turn to.

B005ME7OLC|4.0|\\"Northanger Abbey\\" was apparently written early in Jane Austen's career, but not released until after her death; it is unclear that she ever quite finished it.  \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a broad parody of the gothic novels that were popular in her day, but Austen manages to work in some good characters, plot twists and a rather touching schoolgirl romance.<br /><br />As the story opens, the young and naive Catherine Morland is invited to visit the resort city of Bath with some family friends.  In Bath, Catherine soon falls into fast company. Before any real harm can be done to her reputation, she meets Henry and Eleanor Tilney, respectable brother and sister, who are however members of the dangerous Tilney clan.  Catherine is invited to visit the Tilney family estate of Northanger Abbey, where she finds that a gothic novel has somehow come to life around her...<br /><br />\\"Northanger Abbey\\" is perhaps not Jane Austen's best work, but it is a fun read and an example of her writing range.  It is highly recommended, with illustrations, to her fans.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found this book was a good look into what it takes and what it is like to be a navy seal.  I cannot figure out what is supposed to be controversial about this book.

The songs on this cd are the first 14 songs listed on CD 1 under the two cd set Shake Some Action Live With The Flamin Groovies on the Dressed To Kill label listed and reviewed elswhere on Amazon. This song list was evidently made to promote a tour of Australia and totally different than the original song list and date of recording. Go to Amazon UK to see the song list of this cd. Too bad Amazon US didn't as I would not have bought this.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|This collection of short stories about Sherlock Holmes was quite enjoyable.  There are a total of 12 stories and each one can be read in 10 - 15 minutes.  They always had an interesting problem to solve and Sherlock did it brilliantly.  I can see why he is considered one of the greatest fictional detectives ever.<br /><br />This is a good way to be introduced to Sherlock Holmes.  There were a couple of novels published before these short stories, but this is still a good place to start.  Highly recommended.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|\\"Boardwalk Empire,\\"  HBO's period drama centering on Prohibition era Atlantic City continues to entertain through the whole of season two.  As Nucky`s world starts unraveling on all fronts, this season has many intense and memorable scenes  and interesting plot twists.  I found it to be more compelling than season one,  and season one was pretty darn good.<br /><br />The supporting cast is top notch (Dabney Coleman and Paz de la Huerta are superb in their respective roles), and it was  a treat to see the much underutilized William Forsythe in the role of Manny Horvitz.<br /><br />My favorite character was Jimmy Darmondy (Michael Pitt).  One of the most conflicted characters ever.<br /><br />*****<br />One thing that strikes me as odd is the choice of theme music for this show. \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" is one of the most lavish productions ever broadcast on television, and from the set designs to the costumes, they obviously took great pains to stay accurate to the period.<br /><br />Yet I always chuckle when the show starts with that electric-guitar drenched blues/rock-style theme.  The soundtrack for the show itself is rich with period music, or at least music that seems appropriate for the era being portrayed.  The \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" theme music, though, seems way out of place - sounds like it was second runner up to the theme used for \\"Sons of Anarchy\\".

B008X8QCTO|5.0|Awesome game and worth every cent of the two dollars you end up playing.  Paying an extra dollar for the game a quarter way in is not personal, its just marketing. this game should have started at $3.99 at very least based on others just like it. It has a good balance of story line/mystery and just enough puzzles.  Great job Alawar and you should put out more games like this.  One and a half stars is NO reflection on the quality and length of this game.  If you are gonna complain about price in the written part of the review...fine, but rate the game appropriately in reviews.
B007NCSQFO|4.0|Nicki Minaj's Roman Reloaded is a very good CD.  I am not a particular fan of rap music, but I enjoyed this one.  I think Nicki's Pop songs are the best when she is actually singing and have a little rap mixed in.  Since I am not a \\"real\\" rap fan, those songs that were all rap were secondary to me.  Overall, it is a great CD and anyone would enjoy it.  I almost gave it five stars but did not because of the rap.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|LOST's third season was the best. We shall provide but a few examples of its greatness in this review. Please note: The massive hiatus that followed season three (late 2007) produced absolutely hundreds of insane fan theories. These may be mentioned in this review.<br /><br />The Greatness:<br />1. Ben Linus - formerly known as Henry Gale, we meet the leader of the Others this season. He's smart and manipulative, and doesn't take kindly to people leaving the Island.<br /><br />2. Desmond - he is the wild card. When he's not busy with preventing the Island's destruction, he can see the future in the form of FLASHES.<br /><br />3. Dharma Initiative - we get to see who they were and what they did. More stations are discovered and more Island territory is seen. Also, we get to see what happened to the DI.<br /><br />4. The Showdown - the Losties have a chance at getting off the Island, but they'll have to face the Others to do it. The radio tower returns, as do the numbers: 4 8 15 16 23 42<br /><br />The Theories:<br /><br />1. The Island is Lost in Time<br />2. The Others are the decendents of the Island's original inhabitants<br />3. The plane crash was staged<br />4. The smoke monster is Vincent<br />5. Walt has the Shining<br />6. Ben Linus is a secret billionaire<br />7. Kate works for Widmore, who arranged the crash<br />8. Desmond Caused the crash (of 1929)<br />9. The numbers are biblically significant<br /><br />Season 3 is the best of LOST!<br /><br />2.342
1476712042|5.0|After reading some of the reviews on this book, it seemed to be one of those books, as my friend Nereyda put it, people either love it or hate it, no in between.  Well, I absolutely loved it.  Abby Abernathy has come to Eastern University in the hopes of leaving her tainted past behind.  She just wants a new beginning where no one knows her and no one knows her father.  Travis Maddox, hotness personified, is the bad boy every woman wants to get their hands on.  He's a fighter, and a very good one, fighting in an underground ring where he is known as the undefeated champion, Travis \\"Mad Dog Maddox.\\" He uses the money he makes to support himself while in college.  He's charming, sexy, tattooed, possessive, he has a temper, and he's not used to women brushing him off.<br /><br />Abby's best friend from home, America, has come to the college with her.  America dates Shepley, Travis' roommate and cousin.  Shepley takes America and Abby to one of Travis' fights, which usually occur in abandoned basements, moving locations each time so they won't be busted.  The fighters are in the middle of a circle, while the rough crowd makes bets, cheers, etc. all around them.  Fascinated by what is going on, Abby makes her way to the front of the crowd while Travis is fighting, needing to see what was going.  She gets splattered in blood, the next thing she knows the fight is over and Travis is standing in front of her telling her, \\"Sorry about that, Pigeon.  It's a damn shame about the sweater.  It looks good on you.\\"  That is how Abby and Travis first meet.  They end up at the same table at the school cafeteria, and Travis ends makes his way down to where Abby, Shepley, and America are.  Abby is determined that she is not going to be one of his \\"groupies\\" that fall all over him.  Determined that she is not going to fall for his BS, she develops an attitude of indifference.  One things lead to another, she goes over to Travis' apartment with America, dressed like a homeless person thinking this will dissuade him, and much to her surprise he isn't fazed.  Not only does he not put the moves on her, he acts like a friend. She also finds out that he is somewhat of a genius and has A's in all his classes, so not what she expected.  They become friends, Travis tutors her, and  she gets to know a side of Travis that few people have ever seen.<br /><br />After the boilers go out in their dorm, Abby and America go to stay with Shelpley and Travis and Travis' apartment.  Then after Abby loses a bet, she stays an additional 30 days.  The closer they become, the blurrier the lines get, yet Abby isn't ready to admit they have feelings for each other that are more than platonic.  They have some major fights, and they have some really good times.  She sleeps in his bed, without sex.  They have the whole Dawson's Creek thing going on, while battling the undeniable chemistry between them and the feelings they have for each other.  Both are from dysfunctional families and have major issues.  Travis is desperate to have Abby with him and will do anything to keep her there.  He's let her into a place that he has not let anyone in before.  He has a dark side, but Abby is the only one who can truly see the light within him.  Abby has plenty of her own hangups, regarding herself, what she thinks about herself, and who she thinks she should and shouldn't be with.  Despite all this, they do fall in love, and they fall hard.  When things are good, these two are great together, and when things are bad, not only them, but everyone around them is miserable.  They face issue after issue.  Abby's past comes back to haunt her, Travis screws up, they don't speak for months, then they can't stay away from each other.  It sounds really messed up, I know, but in reality, who can really say that they aren't screwed up in some way or another.<br /><br />I can't even begin to cover all they go through in a review, but trust me, you will never have a dull moment.  At times, I would have liked to slap them both, and at other times, I wanted to ball my eyes out over their hurt and pain.  I really like both Travis and Abby's characters.  They were flawed, but they were real.  The romance sizzles to.  I loved the secondary characters in the book also, especially Finch, Abby's friend.  He was a hoot.  This story made me laugh, cry, get angry, and feel heartbroken.  My emotions went from one end of the scale to the other as I experienced along with these characters the things that they were going through.  Though it was heart wrenching at times, I am so happy that I read this book and was able to see these two characters work through their problems and their pain.  Though they don't come out perfect and unscathed, they come out together, and it is truly beautiful.  I loved this book, and I think everyone should give it a chance.  You may love it or you may hate it, but you'll never know till you give it a try, and it's so worth the experience.<br /><br />The quote below from the book I think sums up this Travis and Abby's story better than anything, and it's my favorite quote from the whole book.<br /><br />\\"It's dangerous to need someone that much. You're trying to save him and he's hoping you can.<br />You two are a disaster.\\" I smiled at the ceiling. \\"It doesn't matter what or why it is.<br />When it's good, Kara... it's beautiful.\\"ave liked to slap them both, and at other times, I wanted to ball my eyes out over their hurt and pain.

B004ZJZQFG|5.0|Best depiction of a WWII submarine in the US Navy. The action is exiting and very believable and the photography is crisp and clear. The sound is mated to the action quite well so that the total movie experience is satisfying.<br /><br />The video was presented in a nice package with some relevant extra material after the feature film.<br />This was a very good value when purchased through Amazon.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|My biggest beef with this book is that it sounds like a short story some star-struck girl cooked up in her diary while fantasizing about some odd and unobtainable famous dude. Yeah... all that on steriods. Oh wait, that's exactly what this is. And it keeps going for two more books! Not short ones either! Not to say I don't have an appreciation for armature authors, but come on, the writing is worse than Twilight (bring on the haters). The story line is not very good and incredibly redundant. If this were about a real woman, (not to say anything against those in the lifestyle as described AT LENGTH in the book, to each their own) at the first sign of an obsessive and controlling nature, Gray would have gotten decked, or kicked in the nuggets. Sorry, this book was absolutely not my cup of tea, not just for subject matter, but for its unbelievably base literary content. So not ordering the remaining books, especially after reading a summary of the last one saying she changed him into a family man, another horribly cliche stretch of the imagination. Yeah.... the nickname 'Mommy porn' is so right it's scary. F.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 was a wonderful walk through history in a very what if setting... often we ask ourselves what would have happened if certain events in life had not happened.  What if one person can go back and change some of the bad...like the day JFK was killed by a coward and America mourned?  Jake Epping is given the chance to change history through going in a 'rabitt hole'.  It is a rabit hole shown to him by his dying friend Al who no longer has the strength or health to change history.  At first Jake has doubts that this is not just a fanciful dream, but he tests it out by going in and changing the fates of a few lives.  He is told by Al that each time someone goes through this rabit hole the past resets.  Still, even after seeing evidence that this is not just a dream, Jake is teetering between going back to change history (saving JFK) or not, until Al makes the decision for him.  Then we plunge into the story.  This story is a very unique and interesting concept.  We see that Stephen King's research is cleverly weaved into a very believable plot, we get glimpses of Marina the Russian wife of Lee Oswald (the beaten wife who does not leave him) and we feel sympathy for her.  Lee himself we also see brief glimpses of what he could be if life had maybe been kinder to him...we see glimpses of him being human.  I think it is a talent when an author can give us a little sympathy even for the villan.  All in all this book was worth every minute, and I loved the ending it was simply perfect!

I don't remember seeing a fat dog<br />till I came to USA.<br />8 out of 10 adult people here in USA are FAT, how do you explain that?<br />They tell you to feed your pets with dry processed foods?<br />They tell you to believe in god?<br /><br />QUESTION EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!!
B002PHVHFI|5.0|This album is pure gold. Whenever I listen to it, I have to listen to it at least three times over. \\"The King of Carrot Flowers Part II\\" is really good for just belting out, even if you're not Christian and you're just doing it satirically. Almost every song is an ultra poetic reflection on sex, history, and atrocities. \\"On Avery Island\\" is also good, but I feel that this album is probably the most essential to any Neutral Milk Hotel fan. But seriously, just buy both! They only made like, two albums!
0316228532|1.0|First off, to avoid problems from the JKR is god crowd: I did read the book.<br /><br />As far as the review goes, it's pretty simple: this book is trash. I mean, like \\"romance\\" novel (read porn, or smut if you prefer) trash. Boring, pointless, hopeless, depressing and vulgar trash. This book should have been written under a pseudonym so well-meaning parents don't get it for their HP loving children. I can't recommend any ADULT read this, and sure as hell wouldn't want it in the hands of a kid. I see reviewers comparing this to classics like To Kill a Mockingbird. Honestly, if you think that this colorless junk is going to be a classic then I weep for our future. I have read better stories in pulp mags.

B001EO748M|5.0|I love to read and study the Tudor era.  I have all 4 seasons of The Tudors and enjoyed the detail, costumes, acting, basically everything about the the series.  The only thing that seemed a bit off was how handsome Henry remained throughout his life.  In reality, even though he was handsome when he was young, he became disgusting as he aged.  I plan to purchse the dvd series of the story that was filmed in the 1970's.  I am sure is was not as grafic as this one was, but will be interesting to watch - I watched it when it was on tv in the 70's and that is what sparked my interest in this era of history.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Here's a story of a true warrior. The world needs more Adam Brown's. This is a quick read that you won't be able to put down.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|The first CGI movie was somewhat marred by occassionally bad dubbing, if anything bad, this is simply marred by not having \\"language\\" as a reason for being R-rated, there's plenty, but not too strong.<br />Let's see, Leon Kennedy? Check.<br />Ada Wong? Check. Great, we got the necessary characters from two of the best RE games there are (2 and 4).<br />BOW's? Definite check.<br />Twists and turns? Check.<br />Somewhat convoluted story that's now trademark? Trademark check.<br />Okay, we got that covered. Leon is in Russia when BOW's appear and take many upon many a populace out. To make it worse, there seems to be something new about the pairing of lickers and clickers, in that they're not constantly attacking every single living being, but are shown to be controlled... externally. Leon, despite orders to get out of Russia, stays to find out what, exactly, is going on. Thing is, Ada is also in Russia, there to meet the very first woman president of Russia in the Motherland's history, to talk about the BOW's and how to take care of the situation. Too bad things get screwed up rather quickly. But hey, it makes for good CGI, video game-based entertainment.<br />Oh yes, there's also the evocative imagery of terrorism, talks about it (more realistic than in Resident Evil 4, which felt forced in the dialogue and rather unnecessary), and a couple pretty good fight scenes, surprise shock moments, some slo-mo moments to capture precise moments during firefights, and plenty and plenty (oh, did I mention plenty?) of bloody violence and disturbing creatures. And the fight between Leon, his new friends, and a couple tyrants definitely was taut and tense to say the least, with the climax of the fight a jaw-dropper.<br />At first, the closing scene was confusing, but it's a good thing I paid attention to what all was being said, or I'd be lost on how what happened happened.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I ordered this case for my Kindle Fire and it is a great value for the money.  Love the way it closes and the stand, attached to the back, for lanscape viewing.  The only improvement would be a better way to stand it to achieve portrait style viewing.  Worth the money, shipped fast and would recommend.
B0094OLFUW|4.0|I loved loved loved their first album.  This one is a little more mello and chill so if you like that type of sound you should like this album.

B003LXSY60|4.0|What I like about this album is how very raw, fun and very throwback it feels. It sounds like something you would buy in the hey day of rock, while still remaining very modern. I love the fact that while polished in a way, this band still remains true to their sound and there roots. This is great driving, rainy day type of music, you will not be disappointed.
B000IZJZLM|3.0|I was disappointed as the first one was so great and easy to fall asleep to.  I wish they would stick to great songs and music.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I've come to love the work of Ken Follett and this book is no different than the others. Well written, emotional, great characters. Well worth the money.
B000WD66BM|4.0|I have heard that his is Nightwish's biggest selling album of their career.  No doubt it was the one that put the band on the map and in some ways ushered in a whole genre of progressive heavy metal featuring bombastic soaring music with operatic female vocals.  Nightwish were one of the first to do it, and remain one of the best.  I only have one other Nightwish album, so am far from an expert on the band, but this is a good solid album of operatic heavy metal.  For me the tracks that work best are the more progressive rock oriented ones such as \\"Moondance\\" and \\"The Pharaoh Sails To Orion\\", both of which scorch with instrumental intensity.  The real unsung hero of this band is the keyboard player.  There is a lot going on underneath the crunching guitars, drums and bass on this one and it is the keys that lay the foundation for everything else.  The vocals can certainly be an acquired taste and for me they work on some tracks better than others, but there is no doubt that Tarja has an incredible set of pipes.  This is a good solid power metal album that was very influential on the genre when it came out.  It has held up well over the years.

B0086900TI|3.0|I'm a teacher, so when I saw the preview for Detachment, it was at the top of my must see list.  It tells the story of a substitute teacher, Henry Barthe's, and basically why he's detached from so many people in his life.  During the course of the film, he befriends a teacher, a young prostitute, and a student.  Each with mixed results.  It's easy to say the film is about Henry's journey, but it seems to also aim at the state of schools right now.<br /><br />During the course of the movie, Tony Kaye intersperses comments from Brody's character as a teacher, talking about the profession as well as beginning the film with testimonials from other teachers about why they got into teaching.  There are moments that show teachers' and administrators' jobs on the line due to low test scores and a meeting being held to discuss how property values in the neighborhood going down because of the state of the school.  This is also one of the very few school related films that points the finger of the problems at home, noting that some problems start with the parents.<br /><br />The entire film is shot with a raw look.  And it's very bold at the statements it wants to make.  Adrien Brody's character is very compelling.  Tony Kaye is good at directing imperfect, broken protagonists.  The problem with the film is that on one end it's about Brody's character, but on the other it's about how bueracracy has all but shattered our public education system.  It's never sure where to shift its focus.  Throughout the film I was definitely in tune to the film's editorializing of our schools, but it takes the focus of of Brody's character, losing sight of his journey.<br /><br />In segments, the film works.  The narrative never successfully progresses and Brody's character never goes as far as he should, despite an incredible performance.  Some of the other performances veer towards melodrama and some of the situations are a little over the top and at odds with the realism the film seems to begoing for.  In a way, I felt I had seen a better attempt at a film like this with \\"Half Nelson,\\" as it was driven more successfully by the characters.  Kaye spends so much time preaching, that the characters seem almost secondary to the editorializing.<br /><br />Still, I have to give this film three stars just for its boldness.  It plays like a laundry list of teacher grievances and there is no doubt that it's pretty on target, even if it does over simplify things at time.  Still, I was dissapointed that Kaye didn't tell the characters' stories better.  The potential of the subect matter is never fully realized.  Good for one viewing.

B009AMAKSQ|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Perks Of Being A Wallflower at Arclight Cinemas in LA yesterday and it was definitely worth the one hour drive.<br /><br />The story is very simple yet complicated because of how much goes on. But the way it unfolds is beautiful and sad, sometimes all at once. While it has its funny moments, it also manages to go through dark topics as well such as homosexuality, drugs and death. Stephen Chbosky handles his story very well, never feeling like it's being forced but rather it flowed nicely and carefully.<br /><br />Directing wise, it was shot very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of Pittsburgh and during intimate scenes between the characters. You could not get anyone better to direct it other than the author himself because this is his book. This is his vision so he knows exactly how it goes in his head and we can see throughout the film, just how much his vision has truly come alive. The result is both engaging and satisfying.<br /><br />Same thing with the writing. The dialogue is very honest and beautifully well written. It was very fun to quote along with the movie. Not just the writing but the overall tone of the film reminds me a little bit of John Hughes' work. Adapting a epistolary book into a film is incredibly challenging but Mr. Chbosky did a fine job of translating it into a film.<br /><br />The musical score is done by Michael Brook who's also responsible for Into The Wild, another favorite of mine, and he did a very good job. In fact, one of the scores made me cry because of how it emotionally resonated with the scene it was fitting in. The soundtrack is awesome. Along with Mr. Chbosky, Alexandra Patsavas, who's also the music supervisor for The OC, did a great job of picking out the songs and treated it as if it were a mix tape.<br /><br />Logan Lerman, my god, he did a masterful job as Charlie. The character literally jumped out of the book and made its wayonto the big screen. Logan's performance blew me away. He did such an amazing job portraying the embodiment of Charlie through his expressions, his emotions, his movements, everything! So perfectly cast. The last 10 minutes of the movie alone is awards worthy because it really shows how talented he really is. I fell in love with his performance. So perfect in every way.<br /><br />Emma Watson did a great job playing as Sam. She is very beautiful and charming. As for her American accent, I thought she did an okay job. There were times where you can kind of hear her British accent slip in and even though you notice it, it's nothing distracting and it didn't really bother me. But you have to give her credit for trying her best and she truly did. I enjoyed her performance very much.<br /><br />The second standout of the film is Ezra Miller! He plays Patrick, a gay character who's not afraid of who he is and Ezra portrays him amazingly well. I've seen almost all of his work, and he's becoming a great actor who's very rare in the sense that he's brave and daring in contrast to the roles he has previously played. He steals every line and scene he's in, becoming the comic relief. But even so, Patrick has his own personal problem and this is where Ezra Miller proves once again just how great of an actor he is.<br /><br />Everyone else in their supporting roles all have their moments. Nina Dobrev, who plays Candance aka Charlie's sister, did a good job. Mae Whitman as Mary Elizabeth was hilarious. Adam Hagenbuch as Bob was great. Erin Wilhelmi as Alice, Johnny Simmons as Brad and Nicholas Braun as Derek were all fine.<br /><br />The rest of the cast: Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott who play the parents as well as Joan Cusack who plays Charlie's Doctor were all good, despite having little screen time. Melanie Lynskey did a very good job as Aunt Helen. Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson is awesome. He's also a standout. Paul Rudd in general is a very likable actor and again, he doesn't have a lot of screen time either but he still manages to play his part memorably.<br /><br />What makes the cast so special is the chemistry. Everyone got along so well and you can tell that they're very comfortable with each other and you feel convinced that these people are really friends. It was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />I love this movie. It's amazing. And I'm not just saying this because I'm a die-hard fan of the book. It has a great script, great cast, it's well directed, awesome soundtrack and undeniable strong performances. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower may not be the most faithful adaptation but the spirit of the story is still there and it does great justice to the book. This is one of the best coming of age movies I've ever seen.

B007A4SDCG|2.0|I listened to recommendations for this work, and after reading through the initial preview, the War of Art seemed promising.<br /><br />The first section was very compelling. The defining of Resistance, and the writer's efforts to construct the 'You vs Resistance', all seemed to work on several levels. Overall, I would say it was powerful stuff. The second section, while less pertinent, was decent company to the first, but it was writing through which I read hoping the writer would bring it back in the book's latter half.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the latter half not only failed in bringing it back, but it methodically and unashamedly deconstructed everything the first portions of the book managed to achieve, and  I couldn't wait to finisht he thing and put it behind me. The writer's fixation on his god turned the message away from stoking one's inner-drive to literally devoting your life to creating art, for art's sake, all in the name of gifting it and devoting it to \\"God\\". This book should have been labeled as Christian testimony. The last half of the book also made a sloppy attempt toward bringing in themes of psychology only to include divinity within the very models being discussed. Overall, once the initial successes of the work come to a screeching halt, it is clear the writer wished only to make the text sufficient in length to be sold as a full-length book rather than an essay. Besides the obvious detriment to the work this caused, it also exposes some hypocrisy where the writer continually sings on the evils of financial motivations.<br /><br />I give the book a two-star rating. I could understand a three-star, but I won't hand that out to a Christian spy that not only disappointed me mid-book, but that misrepresented itself and took from me $9. I would suggest the many available PDF's for this book, because after the first 60 pages or so, it's largely just filler.<br /><br />Save your money. The book should have been an essay.
B008PE9GSA|1.0|I made the same mistake I made buying Mescalero just because it's ZZ Top.<br />I have been a ZZ Top fan since the early 70's. Perhaps I'm old school and prefer to dig into the meat instead of the potato salad. Mescalero was an absolute disaster, true rubbish, and this album goes into the garbage can with it. La Futura reminds me of the Pat Benatar come-back. There seems to be very little BBQ, and a whole lot of smashed, watered down, blended potato salad with a nasty aftertaste leaving you starved. It's quite obvious the band put very little effort into this recording, if they claim to have, they have very little left to share. I'm still a die-hard ZZ fan, but I think some bands need to just retire. The one track of \\"I gotsta to get paid\\" has some decent sound with some riffs if you listen real close and use your imagination, but you keep waiting for the \\"payoff\\" that never happens. There seems to be no structure. No beginning, no high point, and no end to this rambling lost-in-a-cheap-bottle-of-sour-mash recording. You could almost picture the confused mixer trying to figure out just what the (have mercy) to to do with this. The rest of the album seems to almost go somewhere, but never gets anywhere, and leaves you hungry for some meat. Seriously guys, put out some decent music or just go away and quit wasting my time, and my money.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|Late Sunday nights I'm in the habit of visiting my local adult beverage dispensary where the manager is an audiophile and leans toward blues as do I. After the place is largely cleared out we sit and have a few and put whatever comes to mind on the music system. Last Sunday night he says 'look what I've got' and pulls out this album and puts it on. It's not really the type of music I typically gravitate to but I gotta' say, I could've sat there all night and listened to this. Although his is not a polished singing voice, neither is that of many of the greats of this genre. In summary - it's beautiful. I ordered it the next morning and am sitting here listening to it as I type this review. Try it - it's well worth the price.
1439156816|5.0|When I started reading Stephen King's book \\"On Writing\\", I was so pleasantly surprised. I did not just want tips on writing stories and guidelines, I wanted his insight as well.  He told stories about himself growing up and working and how he met his wife.  Stories told of how he was inspired to write several of the stories he did.  I laughed at how he explained his less than perfect years and less than perfect attempts at writing. He's a regular person just like us... good to know!  Somehow knowing that actually inspired me more to keep up my writing and get the cob webs out of my head and put those ideas on paper!  There's something about realizing that he struggles and gets by with humor as well as we have to do at times, that endears him all the more to me.  I'm so glad I read the book.  I actually bought a copy of the book for my son because I know he will be entertained and inspired as well.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love this game!!!!!  way Betta then original. I love this game!!!!  no no no wait I want to make love to this game

B0034G4P8A|5.0|Marvel guys did it again with this movie, it's even better than Ironman's franchise.<br /><br />You have to realize how hard is to create a movie of this type with the story and characters involved!<br /><br />Thor's realm (Asgard) is magically reinvented, with outstanding visuals and really well made costumes! Would like to see a bit more of this.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the Frost Giants...In the cartoons they were huge like 20 ft tall something ridiculous, but in this version they were actually almost the same size as the asgardians... Just a thought...<br /><br />Thor's father, Odin performed by Anthony Hopkins is great, best performance of all the characters..<br /><br />You can really imagine Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the guy is huge as in cartoons with a sort of viking accent...<br /><br />As with all Marvel movies of this and last year, this is a wrap up for The Avengers movie!<br /><br />Great movie most people won't be dissapointed, really entertaining for all ages.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Great show at a even better price. Great perk is that the bluray even came with a DVD copy... now I'm waiting on season 2 of Game of Thrones so I can order it from Amazon as well.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|This is my favorite Marvel hero, and so this movie really didn't dissapointed me!<br /><br />Nice follow up to it's predecessor, wasn't convinced by Whiplash (villain) even Rourke's performance was ok, they didn't exploited to its potential.<br /><br />FX and sound are what expected of a movie of this class.<br /><br />Robert's performance is great, funny, sarcastic, well he was borned to be Tony Stark!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|you should tots yet this game if you like hello kitty and restaurant games its like having your 2most fave games rolled into 1 ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!! i heart this game and even loves hellokitty more yeah

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|very useful for me and what I need to use it for. shopping lists, reminders, everyday notes,  etc ;<br />very User friendly. I'm starting to use it more because of how easy it is to jot a note down.
B0072OFM28|2.0|Granted no one can bring back some of the previous key players but this season left us with, wow, bloody fights and nudity. Writing seems to have been a secondary kind of thought eh? Pretty disappointed and would not buy again.<br />thanks for nothing o Spartacus team..<br /><br />JR
0316228532|1.0|It was my 8 year old daughters birthday and I happened to be in my local book store.  I saw this in a display and thought \\"...Wow, she wrote the Harry Potter series, my daughter Ophelia would love this\\".<br />Anyway, I wrapped it up and gave it to her.<br />Next thing I knew she asked me questions about drugs and sex..she said they were in the book I bought for her birthday.<br /><br />I feel that her childhood is gone now.<br />This book should be sold BEHIND the counter so people know its not for children.<br /><br />How can we expect our children to grow up happy and healthy when filth is all around?
0385344333|2.0|I'm a Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan and have been since his first book. I preordered this one a month ago with great anticipation. 50 pages in, I had to go back to the title page to make sure this was really Lee Child. If this had been the first Reacher I'd read, the rest would not have been purchased. It's not that it is a bad book, if you like those .99 Kindle edition books, without typos. This one was a disappointment, based on past experience. Will I get the next one? Yes, hoping this was an anomaly.

B0031RSATC|3.0|Having worked in an Emergency Department I found this book very funny and true to life.  A quick read trying to make light of a serious subject.
B005COO1X6|1.0|This was just stupid.....I mean really? i have read and watched steven kings work before and enjoyed some but this was just dumb
B00136JOF2|2.0|I agree that Mariah Carey has a spectacular voice, but like so many self-styled soul singers since Whitney Houston started this particular craze, she consistently attempts to see just how many notes she can create out of what was undoubtedly written as just one note.  Consequently, at least in my opinion, the tremendous quality and power of her voice is overshadowed by all her \\"stylin'.\\"  Whitney's style was much more contained and did not detract either from the music or her voice, but for some reason, everyone since has been trying to outdo her and, in their attempts, failing miserably.  I say that if you're lucky enough to have the voice to begin with, rely on it and forget about stylin'.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Of the non-mathmatical cosmology books I have read, this was by far the best written, most understandable, and most entertaining.  In addition to learning new information about \\"Nothing\\", I also enjoyed the history and the humor.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in the creation of our universe.
0307730697|5.0|A GREAT BOOK ABOUT A GREAT PERSON.<br /><br />Not just a typical Navy SEAL book. This is a fantastic story about on of the most amazing men on the planet.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book spoke to me personally because at 80-years of age I want both more and less time. A paradox? Perhaps the timekeeper can assist me. Starting at the beginning of time, the timekeeper has seen it all and heard it all. What was a curse to him was a blessing to others. An excellent read from Mitch Albom. I reccommend it.

B00004R997|3.0|I love SALUDOS AMIGOS. It's a fine movie during Disney's \\"Anthology Years/Package Film\\" years...<br /><br />...however, they cut the El Gaucho Goofy segment.  There's a section in which he is smoking a cigarette that segues into his transportation from the US to South America that was axed.  Of course, to the casual viewer, they will not quite notice the jump cut, but I noticed it prominently because I've seen the original.<br /><br />I love Disney, but, I must admit, that in this day in time, I think they go to the extreme in insulting both the consumer and the collector's intelligence whenever they release these \\"sanitized' versions of their films out of fear of being politically incorrect.  I have Mickey Mouse in Color Volume 2, and they redubbed a section from CLOCK CLEANERS because it \\"somewhat sounded\\" like Donald was using profanity. I guess that's why they have yet to release SONG OF THE SOUTH on DVD because Bre'r Rabbit/Uncle Remus look so politically incorrect nowadays. I'm sorry those films were not PC when they were made, but, as a teacher, they can be used as a teachable moment to show people/children how far we've come in the social/cultural depictions in cartoons.<br /><br />Because of this situation, I have to downgrade this DVD.  I would have voted it differently if they had been upfront in stating that this was an \\"edited\\" version of the movie...because it is.<br /><br />I hope that they will eventually release the uncut version of this movie if not on Blu-Ray, then as a streaming video offering.<br /><br />A little disappointed...
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Damn it. I wish I had known this was a sex-related book. I wish I had never read it. I can not beileve they made such a fuss over that! Lesson learned; always read reveiws! Sorry Mr. James, no hard feelings (It's mr. isnt it?).
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I really enjoyed this game at first! It is fun and challenging yet simple. It got old quickly though as I would have only repeat prizes falling and couldn't get the ones I needed for bonuses. I would also find myself dropping coins for quite a while between prize-drops. It seemed a bit pointless to drop coins without any prizes to try for.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|perfect waist of time. cure for bordum. just like the real machines without the carnys. tons o fun. gotta get it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I wouldn´t recommend this story for a faint of heart.  The journey you take with Harold not only will be physical but also psychological. It is a spiritual ride of life, light and darkness, heavier on the darkness.
B00006CXSS|5.0|One of the best war films ever created, this is the whole season of Band of Brothers packaged in a multi-dvd tin which I am proud to have on display for my friends to see.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Simply put the book was awesome! It was great to learn more about the modern SEAL.  I loved the controversy that was surrounding the release of this book and how it all got shot down.  Excellently written.
0811879542|5.0|The beauty of this book is that it captures a child's imagination.  It is simple but creative and our 3yr old daughter absolutely loves it.  Each time she reads it, she is still excited about making things happen to the dots and we have already read it a ton of times!
0525953728|5.0|I read this book from start to finish without putting it down. I've never done that before. It is that good!<br /><br />In America today, it's impossible to say much of anything without the wolves coming out from hiding. Such is the case here. What better way to bring attention to oneself than by finding something in the public limelight, then attacking it - who cares if you have to bend the truth to do it. Which is exactly what I think has happened in some of the low rated responses.<br /><br />My opinions...<br /><br />Read the book. If you walk away not 200% impressed with the Navy SEALs, I'd worry that maybe you are a terrorist. Some of America's best, PERIOD! That Bissonnette idolizes \\"the Navy SEALs\\" is non-debatable. That Bissonnette is proud to have been a Nave SEAL is blatantly obvious. How one responder could attack him as being egotistic reflects only one thing - a responder trying to draw attention to himself. With respect to the actual UBL mission, Bissonnette stated more than once that ALL of the SEALs were qualified for the mission, that his being selected was simply luck - being in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />Did Bissonnette reflect a negative stance with respect to Obama & Biden - make no mistake there, YES! If after reading the book, you take a step back, you can see how operationally the SEALs were impacted under the Obama administration. Obviously the element of surprise is paramount with respect not only to the success of a mission, but to the safety of those in harms way. Ask yourself this: How would you feel with several missions behind you, knowing how important surprise is, when this time you are required to announce your presence by first yelling at the terrorists to surrender. Someone in the scheme of things has been watching too much TV.<br /><br />Did Bissonnette break the code of silence? I wouldn't want to argue otherwise. Yet, and I may well be missing something here, what is the justification of a code saying that not only can you not talk about anything classified, you can't talk about what you have done at all? Especially after Obama announced to all the world that the US had killed UBL? What good is a code that, when politicians without the facts spin tales of what happened simply to grab the spotlight, those that put their life on the line can't correct that mis-information?<br /><br />I thank Bissonnette not only for what he, all the SEALs, and everyone in the military has done to preserve and protect our freedom. I thank Bissonnette for having the courage to share with us the facts, the truth about the UBL operation.

B004A7UVLC|2.0|Sherlock: The Blind Banker, 2011 film<br /><br />A young woman is alone in a building. She removes a cloth covering an upright figure. There is a fight between Sherlock and a man; Sherlock wins. At home Sherlock uses Watson's password protected computer. Sherlock visits a bank, an old friend works there. There was an intruder in the night, they will pay to discover what happened. Sherlock figures out the probable suspect and goes to his apartment. The man won't talk. The police arrive, Sherlock explains why it was murder. \\"How did the killer get in?\\" John Watson applies for a job, there is only temporary work. Sherlock investigates another murder. Could the killer have climbed the walls? Is there a connection between the two deaths? Sherlock seeks expert advice. He analyzes the receipts of a journalist to trace his movements. They visit a store and decipher the sign of a number.<br /><br />Sherlock says the two victims were smuggling. Sherlock investigates a vacant apartment. Next the graffiti in the subway. An expert in a museum suddenly quit. Is she in danger too? Sherlock finds her and asks for help. There is a noise, someone shoots at him! While Sherlock and Watson are distracted Soo is shot! The male victims had the same tattoo on a foot. They inspect the books in an apartment. Watson and his girlfriend Sarah visit the circus to see Chinese acrobats. A man must escape his bonds before a crossbow fires its arrow. [Was this act OSHA approved?] An acrobat performs while suspended by cloths. Sherlock and Watson study the code. Sherlock deduces the book used and returns home. Watson and Sarah are captured by the Chinese gang and threatened. Information for Sarah's life! They mistook Watson for Sherlock. [Do all Occidentals look alike to Orientals?] Sherlock shows up to save them. The arrow hits one of the gang members. Sherlock talks to a Personal Assistant about a gift. Will Shan be brought to justice? No. [This allows the possible return of this Dragon Lady.]<br /><br />This story is barely average. The idea of a gang of foreign criminals threatening London is an old, old plot from the early 20th century. One example was from a Continental Power, as in \\"The Great Impersonation\\". John Buchan wrote many novels about a foreign threat (\\"The 39 Steps\\").
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|The movie provides closure for the many of us who simply could not accept that a series this good got cancelled in its first season. Must watch the series BEFORE watching this movie to truly appreciate it.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|This is THE BEST COLLECTION! A Must have! Dirty Harry pulls his pistol out on this set so many times, It's a wonder there is any bad guys left! Some of the BEST Clint Eastwood works Ever! This is a good weekend marathon set to watch. Get this Dirty Harry collection and Make Clint Eastwood's Day!
0316044695|5.0|I bought this book about a year ago at a garage sale, it sat on my bookshelf until this week when I decided to read it.<br />Yes, the first part of the book is about Seal training but it gives you insight to the way they fought and acted when they were on their mission.<br /><br />I thought it was well written, I felt I was there with them and felt every bump and bruise. It also brought me to tears.<br /><br />It lets you know that not all the people in Afghanistan are like the Taliban.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book
B003ASLJS6|5.0|There so many Good Clint Eastwood movies, It's impossible to pick the best! But this one is on the TOP! The cowboy action and shooting scenes are the best. In the end it makes you think can there be this type of judgement? One of Clint Eastwood's best!

0718154770|5.0|As usual Jamie Oliver has managed to provide the reader really imaginative tasty and healthy menus that people can easily prepare at home for friends and family.  There are easy to follow step by step instructions to prepare and serve full course meals including appetizers and desserts as well as entrees.  We have prepared a number of the meals and all have been a raging success.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel while really interesting at certain places fell short for me overall.  I found the back and forth nature of going from one main character to the other, referencing the same time period (for the most part), to be tiresome.  Since I read it on my Kindle, I wasn't aware of how close I was to the end of the book. I was really surprised when I realized that it was over.
B005LCECU6|5.0|I always reach for a live version of a song/album.  This one wont disappoint the avid Rush fan.  The bonus tracks are a great bonus.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this Bible app it makes it easy to keep up in church and nice study Bible<br />easy to find the scriptures.
B009471JQE|3.0|Not one of their best and I am still finding my way around deciding on my favorite tracks. No real standouts but always good to have something new from the boys. Billy again delivers some interesting sounds from his guitar. Missed more singing from Dusty.
B000NA28I4|1.0|I even rated \\"Snakes on the Plane\\" better than this one. Graphics were simi ok, but whom ever directed this, doesn't need to touch another movie again. Seriously.

B008602KQI|4.0|I loved this movie and I am excited I finally have it on DVD. I took away a star because when I saw this movie I had yet to read the books. So, I was somewhat confused about a few things. But, I now read the books and everything makes much more sense. None the less, I loved the movie and can't wait for the next ones!

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|My 17 year old daughter love this show.  We already have Season 1 and were so excited to get Season 2.  I bought this for her as a birthday gift.
B008X8QCTO|2.0|I usually love Alawar games but on this one it only let me play a quarter of the way through then I had to spend another $.99 to get the rest!! why not chard $1.99 and give the whole game. I finished it and it was fun but do not like being fooled after I'm hooked on the game.
B008N5UX9M|4.0|This is a great rock and roll release by Steve Harris.  It is much different from his Iron Maiden band.  This is a lot more melodic and straight ahead rock and roll.  The vocals by Richard Taylor are very good.<br /><br />Stand out tracks on this for me are Us Against The World, The Chosen Ones, and Lost Worlds.<br /><br />I give this a solid 4 stars.  I think if there were a bit more diversity between the songs then it would warrant a 5 star review, but for the most part while very good all around the songs sometimes sound too similar to one another.
0316228532|5.0|Through the special argot Rowling utilizes, the reader can almost feel like sexual fluids are splashing all round them in this sexual thriller.  The passion is bifurcated into the categories of, hot and super hot.  The first 100/150 pages will be just \\"hot.\\"  However, after that, you are in for a ride.<br /><br />However, be careful.  Your panties will get wet.  So, realize what you do when you open this masterpiece up.  This juggernaut will coalesce your sexiness and provide the perfect soporific that you need!
B005FISBTO|3.0|Season six of Dexter is getting rather tired.  We are dog tired of the gross, symbolic opening sequence that was amusing the first season or two, but it's been the same, no changes.<br /><br />The basic formula of the show - where some bad guy in each episode is sleuthed out by Dexter, who eventually tracks him down and kills him in some ironic and justifiable fashion - is all but gone in this season, save the high school reunion scene at the beginning.<br /><br />That leaves the story arc that spans each season, and is different for each one, and the story arc that spans the series.<br /><br />Again, NO SPOILERS.<br /><br />THIS SEASON'S STORY ARC<br /><br />This season they brought in Edward James Olmos, who was magnificent in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but they didn't give him a lot of rope in this plot.  They brought in Tom Hanks' son Colin, who was pretty good as the leading bad guy, but didn't quite save the season.  And a plot about the Apocalypse (the end of days according to the Christian Bible), which done right can be intriguing and creepy, and at times it approached these.  But the plot didn't really hold up, and it kind of fizzled out at the end.<br /><br />THE SERIES STORY ARC<br /><br />The story arc spanning the series is the two halves of Dexter's life - home and work - which are not all that separable due to his sister working where he does, and this season, due to a hot new babysitter who is the sister of Batista.  Really?  She can make a living as a sitter?  But she IS hot.  The only possible explanation for Dexter resisting her is that it's not in the script.<br /><br />Office politics plays a major role in the story for a change, particularly where they involve Debra (Dexter's sister), who is going through a lot of changes in the office, as well as taking up therapy.  She is learning a lot about herself and her relationship with her \\"brother\\", to whom she is not actually a blood relation.<br /><br />And in the end, just as the Apocalypse finale sputters and fizzles out, we suddenly realize that it's this other story line that was the real point of this season after all.  Oh there were clues all along, but we did not see it coming.  We have seen cliffhangers in earlier seasons of Dexter resulting in potential changes in the series story arc, and this event may as well.<br /><br />The question is, will this event be enough to reinvigorate the series?  Because to my way of thinking, season 4 - with Trinity - was the last really compelling series, and seasons five and six have been simply paying the dues.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />Three Stars on Amazon means \\"It's OK\\".  It had its moments.  Some episides I would say \\"I like it\\", others not.pse finale sputters and fizzles out, we suddenly realize that it's this other story line that was the real point of this season after all.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Nice story but don't like the ending.  I am against violence.  Why does it need for the main character to be beaten up.  I think  E.L. James was easy on Christian after being mean to Ana after he found out that Ana is pregnant and then walked out.  Ana should get justified of getting back to Christian after he hurt her<br /><br />All in all it's only an okay book for me
B004QL7K6G|5.0|I've seen the reviews for Wanderlust here, on imdb.com, yahoo, etc. Man, there are a lot of people \\"hatin' on\\" this movie! I don't get it. My husband and I thought it was *hilarious*. We laughed --hard--all the way through. I am a sucker for Paul Rudd and loved seeing him teamed up with Jennifer Aniston again (remember The Object of My Affection?). Justin Theroux was quite excellent. Hey -- it's a light, funny bit of fun and sometimes there's nothing wrong with that!
B005LAJ23A|3.0|I would like to review this as a 5 star but my blu case was almost completely broken and the discs were loose with all of the broken plastic.  Thankfully the broken pieces did not scratch the discs.  This is a great show and I would like to rate higher but the quality the product arrived is unacceptable.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher series.  There is only one novel that I consider a \\"miss\\"...and this wasn't it.  This is Reacher at his best.  Please, Lee Child, write faster.  :-)
B0033B5XCS|4.0|I've seen the 3rd installment a few of times, but now finally watching all of them (own this collection). The originals \\"totally\\" fit in with the 80's era. It makes me remember all those wives tales told at my friends sleepovers as a child about \\"dont  fall asleep before midnight\\". in a way these movies are so unreal yet still creepy. Not sure how to explain that until you watch at least one of the nightmare movies...  I love the main title theme song too.  so creepy- I love it!  Gets me so in the mood for Halloween!  1,2, Freddy's coming for you..
B005IQZB14|4.0|This is an enjoyable read. I know Cheryl was young at the time, but she was very lucky in some events that occurred, considering how poorly prepared she was. It did lead to some introspection.
1439148953|5.0|My parents both came from Ireland.  My Mother met my father in San Francisco.  She left a suitor at home and went back after a few years but had acclimated to San Francisco and couldn't live in Ireland any longer.  This book helped me to understand what my parents went through when they immigrated. I am a big Colm Toibin fan and this book is my favorite.
B008MM9630|5.0|i really like this game and its a fun way to spend your time when you're Bored. Great game over all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoyed this game it takes a while to complete which is good. The advertisements are annoying however the fact that it is free makes up for it.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY GOOD AND A BIT SCARY, THE ACTORS WERE GOOD ESPECIALLY CHARLIZE THERON, MADE SOMETHING FROM THE STORY MAKE MORE SENSE, NOT SURE FROM THE ENDING WHAT ELSE CAN BE TOLD, WOULD DEFINITELY RECCOMMEND IT TO OLDER TEENS AND ADULTS.... SOME SCENES WERE PROVOKATIVE!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|One of the best movies to instill the concept that all persons have value and should be treated with dignity. Never overlook a persons potential because of where they come from or their learning ability.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book i almost couldn't put it down. i cant wait to read book two. I suggest reading it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a must-read for anyone interested in coverst ops.  Very happy to read a no nonsense, no frills account of special operations at work. We owe these people very much for what they do for our country.
0765322889|4.0|I quite enjoyed this fantasy hitout. With so many other reviews on here I want to share what I liked and what I did not like.<br /><br />Likes:<br />-I like the way Erikson writes. His metaphors are excellent and well thought out. Sometimes I am astonished by the richness of his description.<br />-I like the way the book is compiled. Subtle hints are dropped throughout the book to reveal at what time such events occurred with other events (SPOILER ALERT: e.g. Baruk looking out his window at a crew working on his local road and knowing something is up, but, Erikson leaves you hanging for about 100 pages until you realise it is the Malazan Bridgeburners plotting).<br />-Everything throughout the book is pretty much part of the meta-narrative. This has often been viewed as negative but I get annoyed when reading 100 pages that are essentially surplus to make the book 'thicker', unless of course the book is written in an 'old school' story-teller style.<br />-The story in general is very entertaining and actioned packed<br /><br />Dislikes<br />-The book kind of just throws you into the thick of things without really building up/developing the major players and plot lines which leads you to flick back and forth between place names as well as magical jargon. The different people groups/races can also be confusing (as a counterpoint to this you sort of get the sense that Erikson does this deliberately so you can better identify with Paran (probably the protagonist although I am still only new to the series))<br />-There is no map of the entire world. At one point I was looking for the Malazan capital until realising that it did not even exist on Genabackis.<br />-Too many characters and at times too much going on. At one important juncture (SPOILER ALERT) a demon just comes out of nowhere and gets involved in a battle and left me thinking 'what the heck is this?' Again I found myself referencing the front of the book to see who these characters are. I can sense that thisseries may only be half read if this continues as I only reached book 6 of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series because there was just too many 'players' and bit parts throughout.<br /><br />Anyhow there is a balanced review for everyone from my perspective. I give this book 4 stars
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome app, and just keeps getting better every update! Great app if u have free time or need to kill time!
B008XG1X18|5.0|App is great. Love pinterest and now I have it on the go which is even better. Easy to install and use.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Ok here's some advice y'all need to know. You need to stop complaining about them asking u to buy gems!!! lots of freakin apps have that crap!!! All you have to do is not buy them!!!!Seriously!!! Just stop complaining!! Its a good app, for those of you who read some of that annoying crap people write. I say you should get this app, Ive had it for a year and its still one of my favorite apps! Get this app!:)  ( just to let you know I'm not a hater, I just get mad when other haters ruin the fun for everybody!!!)
B002C2XXJY|5.0|The first couple of times I listened to this album I instantly liked some of the tracks. But I didn't love them all. Now that I have edited this review on \\"8/13/13\\" I realize (after listening today) that this album on a whole is kind of a grower. My initial impression was that it was overall good but had some filler. I was utterly and completely comparing it to her debut [[ASIN:B001RFIGQ2 Don't Forget [Deluxe Edition]]] which I admit I'm HEAD OVER HEELS WITH. Basically, there isn't much filler at all now. The standout tracks are \\"Falling Over Me\\", \\"Catch Me\\", the infectious \\"Every Time You Lie\\" (which is one of the best tracks here), the dance-y pop rock \\"Remember December\\" (wasn't crazy about this when it was a single but I've since grown to like it a lot), I also like \\"Solo\\", \\"Here We Go Again\\" (another of my favorites), \\"U Got Nothin' On Me\\" and well...basically everything other than \\"Everything You're Not\\" (it's OK but there's something I don't like about it) and \\"Gift Of A Friend\\" which is the worst song on the album. The latter track should have been cut from the album completely...yes, it's that bad!<br /><br />I really like Demi. She's pretty and has a great voice. Vocally she is literally untouched by her Disney brethren. She's been through a lot in her personal life also and in that way I find her more relatable than your average celebrity. But she was best with the catchy pop rock numbers. There are definitely a bunch here (mostly in the beginning of the record) but she has a few songs that took chances genre-wise too. All in all it really did work and I think this is her second strongest record to date.<br /><br />I changed this review a LOT since its conception.<br /><br />4.5 stars.onception.<br /><br />4 stars.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Great Movie But it needs more Cant say what it needs cause thats for them to find out lol but good movie and hope to see more like it
B004XWMXX8|3.0|Adrian's track by track. Letsgo2thestars!<br /><br />1. Love You Like A Love Song: Overall, the lyrics aren't bad but the song had to grow on me. One of the better tracks here. 4/5<br />2. Bang Bang Bang: Catchy and pleasant. I like it. 4.5/5<br />3. Who Says: Inspirational. Her thin voice shows here but it's a nice enough ditty. 4/5<br />4. We Own The Night (Feat. Pixie Lott): It's OK I guess. But repetitive. 3.25/5<br />5. Hit The Lights: Dance-y songs were never my favorite but for what it's worth this is a decent offering. It's upbeat and fun. 4/5<br />6. Whiplash: Kinda boring dance song. 3.25/5<br />7. When The Sun Goes Down: None of the lyrics really caught my attention but I noticed this dance track mixes in some of her old rock style with guitars. 3.75/5<br />8. My Dilemma: Nothing noteworthy. Faceless dance track. 3/5<br />9. That's More Like It: Honestly don't remember it.<br />10. Outlaw: All I hear is \\"you're an outlaw\\" to an average dance beat. 3/5<br />11. Middle Of Nowhere: It's alright. 3.5/5<br />12. Dices - A spanish version of the song \\"Who Says\\". Exactly the same, just in the Spanish language. 3.75/5<br /><br />Let's start with the positives. I love the cover! Selena looks amazing and Biebs is a lucky dude. :) I like the old-school look. \\"Bang Bang Bang\\" which is very fun is my favorite. \\"Hit The Lights\\" is another favorite. Now the bad. The thing about this album is that it's too much dance. And the beats don't differentiate much. If you're going to make a dance record your beats should go hard at least. And the rest of the songs? Generally repetitive. I am so glad I never dove in and bought this. Thank goodness for Spotify! If I had the choice I wouldn't listen to this album again. It doesn't have enough quality tracks on it IMO.<br /><br />3.3 stars.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|It seems that nobody can let the perfect ending to the perfect novel just BE.  Several attempts to portray the post-marital bliss of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are floating around, and all that I have read, including this one, are failures.  P. D. James is a great mystery writer.  I have enjoyed many of her books.  But this one falls flat because it is derivative, unnecessarily convoluted, and just not very interesting.  It adds nothing to Austen's pitch-perfect creation of its two principal characters, and creates a poorly-imagined supporting cast who are reminiscent of an early Agatha Christie English-country-house mystery.  All-in-all, a disappointment.
B006362ZR6|4.0|This album just might have made me a fan. Now I knew of these guys before but couldn't really tolerate the lead singer's voice because at its worst it is highly whiny. However, once I started listening to the sounds of this album I just didn't want to stop. I previously liked about 2 of their singles before diving into this album. That was it. Here? I like all the songs at least a little. None of them stand out as bad filler material which I appreciated. I still haven't got the lyrics down or anything but the production, guitars and drums are generally very pleasant in sound. Something about this album I really dig. I haven't found all the standouts yet but \\"I Can Barely Say\\" is definitely the highest point on the album for me right now. It's a soft, slow ballad which I'm a sucker for every time. Two thumbs up!! I'm gonna check out [[ASIN:B000AA301G How to Save a Life]] right now. Hopefully, it's even better!<br /><br />4.3 stars.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am not only a big fan of Harry Potter but also a bibliophile in general.  Imagine my joy at having another offering to become obsessed with.  Unfortunately, the obsession for \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" borders on complete loathing.  I have to admit I did not and *could not* finish this literary abortion.  At about the quarter mark, I was compelled to delete it.  The run-on sentences, unfulfilled parenthesis and foul language do nothing at all to detract from the one-dimensional characters and rampant stereotypical behavior within a bleak setting.  If there's a storyline, I never found it.<br /><br />I realize this review may sound harsh and undeserved, considering I did not complete the work.  I will say that I did not judge what I read against other Rowling  books but rather against what I consider to be \\"smart\\" writing.  Save your money and your time and if you truly want to own this piece of drivel, wait five years and buy it out of the 25 cent bin.  Furthermore, if anybody cares to offer one redeeming quality that I may have missed, I will re-read and re-evaluate.  However, at this point, I will simply wish I had not wasted resources on an author who seems to be resting on previous fame.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I loved this action movie.  The new young actors did an outstanding job as well.  The special effects were great!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|It's a great book, also it's an easy read. Essential for all chili pepper fans. Roller coaster ride of drugs, girls and writing great music.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I played this game on my Kindle Fire and had no problems playing this intriguing mystery game. The graphics are amazing.  I have been a Big Fish fan for several years and have played many games of this type on my laptop.  I have been unsure how they would make the transition to the Kindle Fire,  but I should not have doubted they would create games comparable to those I play on my laptop. The hidden objects are findable due to the zoom feature if you can't immediately see them.  The mini puzzles are interesting and a challenge,  but are not so hard as to be unsolvable. They can be skipped if you get stuck. The hint feature works very well and I found it the best hint feature of any of the games of this kind that I have ever used. Way to go Big Fish!  The games challenges you to think and problem solve all along the way. I am looking forward to the next installment of Enigmatis. I would highly recommend this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved the Hunger Games. Suzanne Collins did a spectacular job with these books. Once I started reading, there was no sitting this one down. This is a mustread.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have been a great Reacher fan for many years. Not after this book. I will pass on any new ones coming out. The book makes him seem like someone completely made up. Which he is, of course. But even science fiction books have to be plausible. The situations in this book, especially the totally unbelievable ending, are not. I skipped portions of the last part and had to force myself to finish it. Awful.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This is a challenge and well worth the money.  I loved the rooms and story line.  Be patient with the puzzles.  I am waiting for Haunt Two in October from what facebook says!
B007R12TNQ|3.0|Alvin in Chipwrecked was a good movie for the grandkids.  They enjoyed it very much.  I enjoy watching some animated movies but this one did not grab my attention.
1416550550|4.0|Novel is very twisty and keeps you guessing. The authors incorporation of The Secret Garden is ingenious, and anyone who loves that book should definitely read this novel. Overall, I found this an intelligent read, though it did go a bit slowly for me in parts, some information that seems extraneous though often turns out to be necessary for the plot. If you like gothic novels, generational stories, or as mentioned, The Secret Garden, this is definitely a book for you! Reminds me vaguely of Dickens, Bronte, writers from the past despite this being contemporary fiction, which is to me refreshing. Overall, I'd recommend this read.
B009157BWU|5.0|I purchased this not knowing a thing about it.  My husband, who usually hates documentaries, sat through it without saying a word, glued to the screen.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It was a real treat.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|This is not a review of the movie itself but of the packaging of the discs in the package.<br /><br />In yet another way to save money at the expense of quality, Paramount and Disney have seen fit to stack the 4 discs (2 on each side) in the 3D version of this movie.  When I first opened the package, I thought I got a bad set because I only saw the 2 blu-ray discs.  Turns out Paramount/Disney thought it would be OK to tuck another disc under each blu-ray to save space.  And you guessed it, the blu-rays on the top of the stacks are scratched pretty bad.  Does it really cost that much more to give us a 4-disc case?  I'd rather pay a few bucks more to not get scratched discs.  This version is going back and I will probably check out the regular blu-ray edition to see if the packaging is any better.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a good book about a story that needed to be told by someone that was there.  Thank you.  Good job.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|First off I love the movie but the so called extras and bonus stuff was weak.<br />I was expecting a lot more and I was left flat. If you bought the DVD and your<br />upset you didn't get the bonus stuff. Dont worry you didn't miss anything great.
0345505387|2.0|I was expecting a book - not a comic book - graphic meant to me very descriptive<br />reading.  I was very disappointed and was other people who were interested in this book.
B001IF5YLQ|1.0|This was not a mini display port adaptor!<br /><br />This was an adaptor for thunderbolt port!<br /><br />Not sure how and why someone would be able to sell something that's not labeled what it is, right here on Amazon...<br /><br />Anyway... Part is not mini display port.  Epic failure.  Skewed with a live presentation I needed to do, and now I can't afford finding another adaptor for this solution...
B007BZM3HK|1.0|I wouldn't say it's a bad song, her voice isn't bad and the song is catchy and the video was cute (and i cracked up at the end) but OMFG THE STUPID SONG WON'T GO AWAY.  x____x  this is one of those songs where after even just one listen to, it ends up stuck in your head on repeat.  And worst of all, it'll be stuck on the MOST ANNOYING bits of the song to boot.  it really didn't help that the stupid song was freakin being played just about everywhere, so every time i thought I FINALLY got this thing out of my head, it's there again!<br /><br />it's probably not an issue if you actually end up loving the song, but for me it sounds so much like superficial teeny bopper pop music without a single ounce of depth to it that it just became...incredibly annoying.<br /><br />It's driving me insane.  T___T
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy was a long anticipated read, I had heard friends talking about it, and when all the books I had<br />stockpiled to read were read, I downloaded the ebook version.  Needless to say, I took 3 days to read it, could't put it<br />down and shedded plenty tears! My mind is boggled by authors with such inventive minds and imaginations - but the human<br />species is quite capable of greedy, cruel atrocious acts against fellow humans - which is really quite sickening and sometimes<br />I wish I could divorce myself from the human race. A very exciting read if rather gory at times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play Minecraft on my PC and it's always been an awesome game. So, when Mojang finally decided to put it the App Store here, I immediately went to buy it. But in doing so, I kept getting errors and my Kindle is telling me to &quot;try again later&quot;. The five stars is for Minecraft, not the errors I have!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book i've read in a while. It's a very addictive story. I've read the entire series and it's worth every penny.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|great but freezes at times during a game.. well the time keeps going but the tiles will not hilight nor will it allow u to hit any of the options. weird. but overall great time killer and one of the better mahjong apps for my kindle fire- and the best part is that its free!
B008XG1X18|4.0|fails to open frequently on my kindle fire. Also can't make comments because if doesn't recognitize my account but that could just be User error!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app works great keeps good track of power usage. I would recommend this app.  The price was right as well.

B00881VLCE|5.0|I really like this game. Lots of pretty pic to choose from thanks. so much for the wonderful. puzzle @*%#%*
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you read book one and two you gotta read this one too. It makes it all come together so you understand the what and why of the man behind this story. The ending wasn't what I would have chosen, BUT it was a good ending.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Curiously Addicting! A fun carnival style game without all the carney's. Passes the time when waiting for programs to load or while riding in a car.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|this movie has a good cast. and a good plot. theres alot of funny parts. some i watch over and over again
0316228532|3.0|As a retired English teacher, I'm truly apologetic that I cannot finish this book. I know I should  read it and appreciate its merit since I'm certain based on the third of it that I did read that it will provide numerous thesis and dissertation writers with new grain for their scholastic mills.<br /><br />Rowling is an undoubtedly skilled writer who turns out to be far more versatile than the Harry Potter series would suggest. I give her much credit for having more depth as a writer than I suspected, thus three stars instead of the two I'd rather give it. But that's just me at my stage in life, which I'll get to shortly.<br /><br />Grimly realistic is it EVER! Definitely a comedy of manners that skewers masterfully the pettiness and provincialism of small town politics and people without neglecting the simple pleasures that make small town living worthwhile. The overblown sense of self-importance that invests the drive to fill their casual vacancy is an unpleasant reality in many small towns. Those who think that comedy means LOL humor will be sorely disappointed as a result. That's not what a comedy of manners is, hence my saying that this book will be much dissected by English majors.<br /><br />As for me, I want characters that I can become involved with and situations with a resolution that leaves me feeling as satisfied as when I've eaten precisely the right amount of well-prepared food. This is not that sort of book, and oftentimes I thought that Rowling overdid the description to the point of tedium. The book could easily have been one or two hundred pages shorter. There was frequently too much of a muchness.<br /><br />Personally, the many f-bombs didn't bother me; they seemed to befit the characters dropping them, especially those doing so repeatedly. People bothered by stark realism that incorporates believable profanity should avoid this book without a doubt.<br /><br />It is definitely not a book for children. In fact, I doubt that any but the most intellectually mature teenager will get very far into it and appreciate it for what it is.<br /><br />You've now proven you're a writer of depth and merit, Ms. Rowling. Now, may we please have adult fantasy along the lines of Mercedes Lackey? I think you could do that surpassingly well, and it I would relish.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. and definatly one of my favorite horror movies. Add it to your collection
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|I found the songs very interesting and more of a folk spin.  The songs had a nice sound and were relaxing. I recommend this album.
0316228532|2.0|You know that wholesome pop star who desperately wants to outgrow her good girl image? She leaks a sex tape, goes to rehab, and generally tries too hard to prove how bad she can be. That's what this book is. J.K. Rowling is proving that she's not just a writer for kids; she can write a grown-up book with sex, drugs, and a whole lot of foul language!<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is about the residents of the small town of Pagford. When Barry Fairbrother dies suddenly, he leaves a vacant seat on the town council. In the election that ensues, secrets are unearthed, lives are ruined, and people are snide to each other for 500 pages.<br /><br />It's difficult to engage with this book because the characters are just so unlikable. They feel real, but only because they are the people you go out of your way to avoid in your everyday life. There is an occasional clever turn of phrase, but not enough to make it an enjoyable read.<br /><br />Above all, \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is a curiosity. Everyone wants to know how adult J.K. Rowling's first adult book will be. The only thing notable about this book is its author, and comparisons to Harry Potter are inevitable. In place of the whimsical fantasy of the Harry Potter world, we get unrelentingly banal social commentary. There is humor, but it's mean and crass. If I want to read a gritty book about humanity's dark underbelly, there are scores better written and more insightful. Some people will dislike \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" because it isn't Harry Potter, but more will dislike it because it's dull and pointless.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy the game.  Sometimes it is hard for me to figure out how to get out the ad and back to the game.  I have not had trouble with pop-up ads
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Today, I decided to read several of these Amazon reviews, which thankfully I hadn't read any before reading this book. First, I just want to say that you're not winning as an artist (or writer) unless you've got haters. The wide range of love and hate for this book is actually a telling sign.<br /><br />This is a coming of age tale and a simple read. It's not trying to be more than it is. Sure it has some adjectives and dialogue redundancies, but that's what made it less pretentious. It's told POV through the voice/mind of a young virgin (of course it's going to be far from how the reader views the world!). At this point, having not read the rest of this trilogy, I'm undecided how good or bad the story is in it's totality. However, the folks who knock it so hard, perhaps were looking too hard for depth, complexity and literary genius? It's like going to see 'Looking for Mr Goodbar' and hoping for 'Great Expectations'. Why would someone spend their valuable time reading this entire book (it's over 500 pages), if it were THAT bad?
B000S5AGFQ|5.0|This is not only the best Cult album, but one of the best rock albums. Period. Straight up razor sharp rock & roll. Ian's croon's & howl's are on point. It's AC/DC riffage meets The Stones bluesy rock done by goth metal Brits. Awesome.
B008XG1X18|4.0|still has some loading bugs but hopefully will get better.  I love the app though. would love it if I could edit the pin

B006O94DJ0|5.0|Akira is what they call a movie experience. An early-80s anime based off the manga comic of the same name, it is one of the earliest forms of the so-called cyberpunk genre. Akira was the movie that put Japanese animation on the map, and for good reason. Even today, thirty years on, it is still a masterpiece in animated entertainment, and proves once and for all that animation can be one of the most powerful mediums around.<br /><br />The story of Akira starts out straightforward enough but escalates slowly but steadily into very, very deep and existential themes. In the city of Neo-Tokyo, thirty years after World War III, friends Kaneda and Tetsuo live on the streets and get their kicks out of hanging with their biker gang and fighting with their rival gang, the Clowns. Kaneda and Tetsuo have known each other since they were little, but things change when Tetsuo comes into contact with a mysterious, deformed child and is whisked away by the military. As Kaneda tries to keep a track of Tetsuo, Tetsuo begins to harbour enormous, terrifying powers that could not only destroy him but might trigger a chain reaction that will change everything, permanently.<br /><br />The characterization in Akira is wonderful. Kaneda is a fierce friend who finds himself unable to protect his friend when he needs it the most, and then on top of that gets tangled with a resistance movement bent on exposing the government's secret \\"Akira\\" project, around which the whole story centers. Tetsuo's bitterness and low self-esteem are dangerous when met with the powers he is cursed with. One of my favourite characters is the Colonel, who you think at the start is going to be a villain but is a very three-dimensional, conflicted but ultimately righteous soul whom you come to root for.<br /><br />The animation quality in Akira is second to none. Remember that this was the early 80s, when CGI was practically unheard of; everything is done on paper. With that in mind, the attention to detail prevalent throughout the entire film is dumbfounding. Neo-Tokyo is as sad as it is beautiful. The character animation is utterly amazing, especially towards the end of the movie, where things are animated that I (an animation student) wouldn't dream.<br /><br />The way the film sounds is also a strong, characteristic aspect. Akira uses sound in a very clever way, particularly with the use of silence; absolute, stone-deaf silence. Silence is used to make the powerful feel powerful instead of getting in its way. Finally, and I was not expecting this at all, the English dub is wonderful! Normally, English as a secondary language for a film fails miserably, but this is not the case with Akira. All the dialogue sounds natural and appropriate and stays faithful to the Japanese dialogue.<br /><br />Akira is a thrilling, often disturbing movie that is an experience to take in. Clocking in at two hours, it may require a couple of viewings in order to be fully understood. The climax of the movie demands the viewer to keep up, and comes a long way from the techno-centered, dystopian beginning of the movie. Safe to say, Akira is one of the most important animated films ever made, and still one of the cleverest, most powerful pieces of entertainment there is.throughout the entire film is dumbfounding.

B00564GPKY|4.0|I recently purchased this book and spent the past few weeks reading it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  But with a book like this, you are probably asking whether this will add any practical value to you and your life (or job), or whether it is just general interest.<br /><br />Certainly from a general interest perspective the book contains lots of great stories that are really interesting (at least I found them interesting).<br /><br />From an application perspective, I feel that there is enough to work with, even though there could be more.  Throughout the chapters the author does a good job summing up the three components of a habit, explains more nuances of how they develop, and has examples of how people and organizations have changed.  The final section even includes a step-by-step template of how to approach changing habits.<br /><br />The only thing I would have preferred to see is a couple page summary of the key points he made through the book as a final reference section.  However, it is still a 4 out of 5 for me and I recommend it to most who want to understand how to start changing their habits.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Thank God!  I never understood why Adrian left in the first place.  Although, after hearing No Prayer For The Dying back in 1990 I began to see Adrian's side of things.  Anyway, fast forward almost a decade and Iron Maiden are back in top form, performing better than ever with the guitar god Adrian Smith and one of the best vocalist in in the history of heavy metal.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I was pretty much convinced who did what but enjoyed getting there through the writers' story telling.  It did start off a little slow but once it got going it got me good!<br />A little sad with the way things turned out for the main character but I think she found 'closure'.<br />I recommend this to be a good read!! :-)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought into all the hype and was so excited about reading it only to discover that this book is not worth the time or the money. I struggled to read to the halfway point and finally gave up because I just couldn't take it anymore and I rarely start a book without finishing it. I truly don't understand why this book is so popular. There is no true story line and it's soooooo repetitive. I definitely will not be investing in the other books.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|Bought a pair of tiny times for my four year old. She loved them, but after 2 weeks I would no longer allow her to wear them in public. The Velcro on one came unstiched, both soles started pulling away at the toe, and one shoe already had a hole at the big toe area. I ordered them from the Toms website, so I returned to the site to tell of my negative experience on their reviews, however, they do not post negative reviews. I really feel bad for these little kids in third world countries that are so excited to get a new pair of shoes, knowing they will be trash in a week. I read on there site that they give out new shoes every 6 months. It's horrible that they sell cheap shoes at an inflated rate with the pretense of helping children. Another example of exploitation, they should be ashamed.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|You've read all about how great the movie is.  That all stands.  It's great.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray and digital have a terrible mix.  If you make it loud enough to hear the voices you'll go deaf from the explosions, fighting and various other sound effects.<br /><br />Video is excellent in digital and Blu-Ray<br /><br />Also, Blu-Ray 3D seems like a waste.  I'd like to see more options in what formats I can have together.  Right now the addition of Blu-Ray 3D seems like a way to get you to pay a few extra bucks for something a small percentage of the buyers will use.  On the other hand this went down to 19.99 during pre-order so it's a non-issue if you were lucky enough to pre-order.
B0086449YA|5.0|Privateering consists of two discs in the standard edition and three in the deluxe.  The third disc consisted of rehearsal versions of five Knopfler songs.<br /><br />Most songs on this CD could be classified as folk or blues, with a nautical and Celtic flavor to several.  Knopfler, were he tone deaf, could probably be a very good short story writer.  He tells hard-luck tales of truckers, farmers, gamblers, pirates, and small-time musicians.  This melancholy mood is alleviated by several up-tempo and optimistic tunes.  A small criticism: he plays a lot of acoustic guitar on this CD.  I would prefer more electric guitar which I believe is where his talent as one of the world's best guitarists is more evident.<br /><br />According to the poll taken on his web page, the public's favorite songs on this album are \\"You Two Crows\\" and \\"Dream of the Drowned Submarine.\\"  My two favorites are \\"Miss You Blues\\" which is a slowed-down version of the old folk tune, \\"Hard, ain't it Hard.\\"  This tune offers a sublime mix of Knopfler's electric, a harmonica, and a pedal steel guitar.  My second favorite is \\"Corned Beef City\\" which is the hardest rocking tune on the CDs.  However, I often find that after a few hearings I find virtues in songs that didn't seem remarkable at first. So, my favorites will likely change with time and experience.<br /><br />The third CD of familiar Knopfler songs showcases him as a rock guitarist.  He plays a guitar \\"just like ringing a bell\\" (in the words of Chuck Berry). That's the best description I can think of for Knopfler's guitar style.<br /><br />All in all, a CD of nearly all good, thoughtful, well-played, and durable tunes which will please for many passes through the CD.  You'll find new discoveries with each listening.<br /><br />Smallchief

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Many people are saying there was a lot of fill in this book. I disagree! I could have read more about his past, his training, and his previous experiences. I very much enjoyed the insiders telling, of life in the elite.<br /><br />I mostly bought this book to support the brave man who wrote it, all our Seals, and military.<br /><br />My only complaint was, I read it in a day!<br /><br />The writing was done very well, he kept enough emotion out of the telling, he did not reveal any 'trade secrets' that I could see, he didn't throw anyone under the bus and had nothing bad to say about anyone, with the exception of Osama bin Laden and maybe once or twice Obama.<br /><br />A book of real heroes. Every single one of them. Every single day.<br /><br />I just wish there was more to the book....
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I think this was a great ending to the series. I still am not sure how I feel about the ending and if it really is over.
B000TEPED0|5.0|This is the best country album ever written in my opinion. I love and can relate to every single song.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|After toying with this game a bit more I have to say that I am a bit disappointed in myself for giving up so quickly. I admit it took some time and a tutorial would be a great help but now that I have managed to get the hang on things the game is actually pretty fun. Even 1-6 was child's play compared to the later stages. Lots of fun, give it a chance and a little time. Moving it up from a 3 star to a 5 star.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|The book is actually a lot of fun to read.  There is nothing here which is extremely difficult or difficult to enjoy.  The length, footnotes, and a lot of the reviews make it seem that you would read it only as a tour-de-force, on a dare, to prove what a reader you are.  But unlike Ulysses or Gravity's Rainbow, this one didn't leave me baffled for whole sections.<br /><br />Irritated, yes.  There are sections I skip over because they're just too tedious, and wave their arms too wildly to signal \\"major and serious work of literature over here\\": Marathe/Steeply, the history of ONAN, JOI's filmography & death, Madame Psychosis, the long explanation of Interlace.  AO Scott said there's a lot about the book which smacks of a precocious child being called upon to perform at dinner, and I agree to a certain extent.  So, perhaps 10% misses the mark-- is too much, not accurate satire, not worth my time.<br /><br />What he does best in the book is to describe, sympathetically and in great detail, the characters' self-involvement: their inability to get outside of their ravenous heads or to feel for other people except through guilt, shame, loathing.  This goes from the beginning (Ken Erdedy) to the end (Gately hitting bottom).  Isolation is more of a theme than the (showy) achievement-and-addiction-are-two-sides-of-the-same-hill notion which links the two worlds depicted.  There are moving sections where people talk to *themselves,* or about themselves in recovery meetings, but not where they talk to each other.<br /><br />DFW had his own number, and maybe yours too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love love love!!!!! Best app!!!!!!!! I sucked at decorating and this is the only thing that has saved me. my husband and any visitor to my house thanks you.
B0091REZMW|5.0|can't stop playing! at least until I run out of energy...so glad its on the kindle fire now. originally played it on my android phone and was hooked since the beginning. never had an issue with the pay to play aspect that most games utilize nowadays. With this game it is an option to make things go quicker but it is not necessary to enjoy the game.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Like many on here I have been an avid fan of the Jack Reacher series, however, this will be my last one. I struggled to read my way through half the book before laying it down for good. Long and insignifcant repetitive chapters. It's time for Childs and Reacher to retire permanently. Tom Cruise to play Reacher? That's a joke right? This character needs a Steve Austin or a Dwayne Johnson to play Reacher, not a puny little pipsqueak like Cruise. Don't waste your money on this book, it's awful.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book; however, the ending was disappointing....will there be a sequel because it ended as if the author just said....\\"ok, enough of this....\\"
0345803485|1.0|TERRIBLE.<br /><br />The longest, most boring load of rubbish I have ever read. By all means read it, but switch your brain to coma mode for maximum enjoyment.<br /><br />Maybe the book is meant to be used as a device in the red room. If you tied me up and read it to me I'm certain it would be a very painful experience - like being flogged over the ears with a riding crop or similar.<br /><br />Repetitive and poorly written it, unbelievably, dragged out over three books. I found I could skip chapter after chapter of infeasible sex scenes or some mindless chatter between characters knowing it was more of the same.<br /><br />If this is best seller material, then I'm going get to writing! Maybe I could get one if them new fangled email addresses like Ana and send it off somewhere...

B007FG9LIE|4.0|The Pines was a story that was in the beginning, one with a lot if confusion and too many unanswered. Questions got this reader. I never watched the 20 year ago tv programs that you mention after the e-book explaining your inspiration . I would give the book a 4, because it was weird , creepy in an unexpected way
B0083SBMBM|3.0|I bought the Blu-ray and DVD two-disc pack, and the bonus features are only accessible on the blu-ray, which I can't play. How disappointing! I'd like to see the deleted and extended scenes.
0736092269|5.0|This is a great book on bodybuilding. Very comprehensive and has detailed illustrations.<br />Since the pages are so nice and beautiful, a hardcover will protect them better.
0375413405|5.0|Am I as good as Julia Child?  The answer is always no.  But, this cook book truly guides you to becoming a better cook.  I have found that I understand cooking better for reading her recipes and her tutorials.  I rarely need to look up cooking techniques on the internet because of her simplified step-by-step instructions.  Written simply, and filled with amazing eats!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a neat game and keeps your brain working!  I like to just relax with this game even though you have to concentrate.
0375703764|5.0|Ahhhhh, House of Leaves.  This book changed my life.  Seriously.  But I can't really describe how or why.  Each time I read it (about once a year), I read something different; a different story, a different plot, etc...  I learn something new about myself and the world each time.  I give this book to people as a gift, and determine my friends based on who actually bothers reading it, and who doesn't.<br /><br />When the full-color version was re-released, I had to buy a new copy.  Our house has FOUR copies!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have love this three book story all the books are hard to put down, not a slow part in them
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Jack Reacher has become a mainstay of Lee Child.  This latest effort is perhaps the worst of all.  I eagerly awaited this book, hoping to get another Reacher novel in before Tom Cruise ruined the character on screen.  But I was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />The book started off well enough -- Reacher hitchhiking through a small town, some confusing scenes in the car, and an apparent issue across the town that brings in many government agencies.  But this novel ends up a) catering to government conspiracy theorists and b) has such an over-the-top, implausible ending that even Ian Fleming and James Bond would shake their heads sadly.<br /><br />A Wanted Man feels largely repetitive.  Many of the same themes have been covered in other Reacher novels: small towns, larger-than-life character, stoic hero, a damsel in distress.<br /><br />I'm happy I read the book, and it was an enjoyable page turner for a few days.  The ending, however, left me terribly dissatisfied.  Next time, I will aim to borrow from the library.  I have lost my zeal for purchasing new Lee Child Reacher novels.  Now I cannot wait for the cinematic episode to put a final nail in the coffin for this series.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very well written novel about what it takes to become a Navy Seal. Makes one appreciate all that they go thru and why they are such a devoted group of people. This is the second novel I have read about what a person must do to become a Navy Seal. I really appreciate how devoted they are to one another and their country. I don't believe any secrets were revealed in either novel about how the missions were excuted. Having family members who are part of these \\"Special Units\\" and how they won't reveal anything to even family about what goes on behind the scenes, were they have been, and other secrets about the job, I am very proud of them and their respect for each other and their country.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|I don't usually review the faotd that I download, but I really enjoyed this game so I thought I'd throw in my two cents.  At first glance, this may look like a game you are already familiar with, but then the color mixing twist gets thrown in there, and it's something completely new and different.  It's a challenging puzzle game that really requires you to think about your moves.<br /><br />I was really pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable this game is.  Gameplay is similar to Flow, where you have to connect two colored dots by drawing a colored line.  But, where I found that game kind of boring, this one is much more interesting and unique. One of the things I really like is that for many puzzles, it seems like there is more that one way you could solve it.  I like feeling like I'm actually puzzling it through instead of just trying to recreate what the designer had in mind.  The order you do things in is even more important in this game, since you can go over your own lines and doing so changes your board. So you really need to think about how each move will effect your future moves.<br /><br />Personally, I don't have a problem with the lack of instructions.  There are simple \\"tutorial-like\\" levels that, without words, teach you what you need to do for the more complicated levels.  Even if it takes you 2 or 3 tries to figure out what it's trying to teach you, it's still pretty simple.  I suppose I also got the idea there would be color mixing involved from the game's description, so that did not throw me.  As for the little balls, it only took two or three tries to figure that out, as well.  It is a puzzle game, after all.  Try something out!<br /><br />(Just for reference, I've made it to level 26 so far.  The only one I had to skip completely because I could not figure it out was level 15, but I will be going back to try it again.)<br /><br />One thing I'm glad to see is it unlocks a few levels ahead, so if you get completely stuck, you can skip a level and come back (press the menu button).  This is good since there isn't a hint system.<br /><br />And although I would appreciate a level restart button, you can undo as many moves as you want, all the way back to the beginning, or go to the menu and go back to the level, so there are a couple of not-too-difficult ways to do it.<br /><br />The graphics are okay.  Not too slick but they get the job done.<br /><br />For the free app of the day, I think this was a great find and I'm certainly happy I picked it up.  I think I will enjoy completing it.  For a paid app, If you enjoy visual puzzles (and know how to mix your colors :) ) I think it would be worth the buck. Just keep in mind this is a think ahead type game.  If you hate thinking a few moves ahead, then this game is really not for you.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've downloaded and tried nearly every battery utility on the market. This is easily the best of the genre. It is a smooth well designed application that allows the user to view the state of the battery at anytime. This is especially important for those of us who own phones with non-removable batteries, such as the Motorola Droid. With this you can easily evaluate your usage adjusting as needed to get the best life out of each charge cycle and lengthen the overall life of your battery.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A little bit of a slow start for Reacher but all in all just what one wants and expects from a Reacher novel.  Always leaves you waiting anxiously for the next installment.
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|Just finished season 1 of The Walking Dead and watched the first two episodes of season 2 today. I know, I know. I jumped on the bandwagon late, but I am in love with the show. I didn't even know about the show until I started seeing previews of the second season on recent movies. I am a horror fantic and I love anything with zombies in it. The work the show does on the makeup is awesome! I still can't get the half zombie that was still alive from season 1 out of my head. And the storyline is just great. There is really nothing bad I can say about this show. Can't wait for season 3 to begin. In the meantime I will be watching the rest of season 2. Smart move AMC for picking up this show. The people working on this show, keep doing what you are doing. You guys are great!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Very well written, but a real downer. From our 21st century vantage point, it's hard to believe that so many bad things could happen to one person, mostly inflicted by those who should be taking care of her.  Wouldn't CPS have a field day with these characters!  A real switch from our rosy-colored idea that most plantation owners cared for their slaves, that the white people were \\"moral\\" and Christian, and the blacks were just ignorant savages.  This book makes the white people in The Help look like saints. Almost.
B0060D3B5M|1.0|There is a scene when Goofy's son slaps a theme park character for no good reason.  This scene was not funny and not necessary.  I realize that they wanted to show his disappointment with the theme park, but Disney could have got the point across another way.  There was another scene earlier in the movie when Goofy's son is on his way to school, and a girl punches his shoulder because he is acting not so cool.  Also, the very beginning of the movie starts off with a nightmare, from which Goofy's son wakes up to punch the alarm clock.  There is no need for any of this violence.  I had to explain to my son too many times that this behavior is not acceptable in reality and this is only a cartoon.  I wish Amazon would provide a refund.  It is not what I expected from a movie that is rated G.  It is definitely more like PG.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest to begin with. so when I saw this app was free I got really excited!! I will say though... I have a kindle fire and almost everytime I get on the app I have to force close the first tome and then try again, but after that it works! I read the other reviews and got nervous about having problems logging in, but it gave me no problems in that department. I definitely recommend this app for everyone!
B00701L5XS|5.0|Works very well and provides good info about usage of each knot. I especially like the speed control that allows me to slow down the animation to my personal comprehension level. If this is not enough knots to get you though the day you are in trouble.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|The other night on Pirce Morgan. Former Governor Jessie Ventura summed it quite nicely when he said that you hear all kinds of stories from politicians. Some try to down play or play up the events of the day. \\" However there is nothing like Boots on the ground\\". That meaning the story being told from one of the men who did the job. The book \\"No Easy Day\\". Is a factual account of the events of that day with a prelude of information on how the team trained and prepared for the events that lead up to that mission. It was timely and well explained. This is NOT Hollywood folks. Some parts of this mission went by the numbers. but when things went Bad it shows how well trained and diversified these soldiers are. The story's real, The men are real. The results are Very Impressive.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I was sceptical about this series when I started out. I was hooked and really enjoyed all 3 books. I feel like the characters are old friends of mine.
B000FC1LHO|4.0|My son had to read this book in high school so I decided to read it as well. The movie versions are in no comparisons with the book even though you know the basic concept is the split personality of good vs. evil of one man.  I value this story as an adult because of the time it was written and the composition of the words being used.  I'm glad that this is required reading and hopefully students including my son can appreciate this book and what it represents to the here and now.

1609611543|5.0|We are older folk. John is heading for 77 years and I am 73. I have struggled to lose weight most of my life and discovered this book through various on-line friends and recommendations.<br /><br />In 2012 I lost more than 25 pounds during the first 4 weeks I was wheat free. I went on to lose another 35 pounds in the following 5 months which I have been able to easily maintain for the last 3 months. Wheat Belly helped me understand why. Understanding the science has given me a reason to remain wheat free and has made this new lifestyle easy to maintain.<br /><br />The science is compelling and I am absolutely certain that health issues, including Myalgic Encephalomyletis, that have plagued most of my life were caused by wheat and aggravated by the newer hybridised and modified varieties.<br /><br />My husband saw my results and gave wheat free a trial. His pants are loose. He has lost weight and seen improvement in both skin, rosacea, and chronic sinus conditions. My husband is no longer a Grumpy Old Man.<br /><br />I am amazed that there is a co-relation between mood and wheat. This is explained in the book Wheat Belly.<br /><br />The information in Wheat Belly makes me think that many of the problems, including dyslexia and addictions, which I see in our children can be directly attributed to a genetic intolerance of wheat.<br /><br />For a book with scientific research data Wheat Belly is very readable by lay people. Dr. Davis has done a brilliant job of getting the scientific information into interesting and easily understood language and there is no conflict between North American and New Zealand English.<br /><br />The book has made a permanent and positive difference in our lives. I started by reading a free library copy. Next I bought my own personal copy. We have bought a total of five copies to share with family and friends.<br /><br />Wheat Belly has changed our lives and we look forward to a much happier and healthier old age.<br /><br />Anne and John
0316228532|1.0|This is so sad.  I can't finish reading this book.  I was so excited to read it but it is such a dirty book with sex, language and ugly people saying, thinking and doing ugly things that I know this isn't what I should be spending my time thinking or reading about.  As a Christian, I know I would be going against everything I believe in to be advocating this book by reading it. Why must such a talented writer waste her gift on something so trashy?  Is it not possible to write well AND cleanly?  i know it is...read CS Lewis, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens and countless other classic writers.  Sad.

0316228532|1.0|I was so happy that J K Rowling was offering us another book to read. I fully expected it to be as good, and maybe even better than her Harry Potter books. I couldn't believe that this book was from the same author. I finished chapter 4 and decided to read the reviews on the book to see if I wanted to continue. Maybe it would get better. Well, looks like it doesn't. Unless you can identify with the low-lifes of the world, and only them. I wish there could have been a better mix of characters. I can't believe that J K Rowling's audience is made up of mostly low-lifes on drugs with totally hopeless lives. How's about us regular people? I hope she tries again and learns something from all the bad reviews she's getting on this one.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Jack Reacher/Lee Child fan.  But alas, I am truly disappointed. First, we find out that Tom Cruise is going to play Jack in an upcoming movie. Seriously?! Then, after waiting for what seems like a long time, this book, A Wanted Man finally arrives on my Kindle. What a horrible book. Jack is suddenly a math savant and does very little of what he does best - that being kicking some major butt and then taking names. He almost seems like an after-thought to the book. I certainly hope the next book puts Lee and Jack right back where they have always been or you can count me out as a loyal fan.

B008C1O8CA|5.0|After taking a scenic detour through emo-rock with American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, Green day makes a return to their punk-rock roots with the first in a trilogy of albums set to be released through January of 2013, Uno!  And it could not be a more welcome return.<br /><br />Starting off strong with \\"Nuclear Family\\", the whole album is a love-letter to teen-angst, which Green Day has done with many of their past albums.  Some highlights from the CD include the aforementioned \\"Nuclear Family,\\" the anthem to loving life called \\"Carpe Diem,\\" the foul-mouthed tracks \\"Let Yourself Go\\" and \\"Kill the DJ\\", the latter of which could be interpereted as a dislike of the pop-filled society we currently live in, and the powerful tribute to heartbreak \\"Oh Love\\", the track most likely to stick with you long after you finish the album.<br /><br />Is it Green Day at their best?  No, but the true answer to that is a point of debate among GD fans.  Is it a damn good album?  Oh hell yes!  Green Day proves that, after twenty-five years, they they have lost none of whatever it was that made them great.  Heres to twenty-five more years of success, guys!
0345803485|5.0|I just finished Fifty Shades of Grey and it was a very interesting book.  I expected a much more harsh and dark look at S&M.  However the book is well written and takes you page by page into it. Do I recommend this book for everyone, no but for those with wide ranging taste it is something new to read. The first part of the book is slow but after that it is slightly intense.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Another reviewer has stated that the Kindle version has left out the list of characters. Midway through the book I was really confused who is who. I am quite sure that Ken Follett did not know about this.  I would like to receive the list and would reread the book.

B0085MNZ66|4.0|There are no instructions because it is a very simple game.  The game IS figuring out how to connect pairs of same color dots or to change the color of the dot by running its path through the path of another already utilized dot.  When all dots are paired you win.  Simple.<br />I gave four stars because the visual design could have been a lot better.
0802473156|5.0|This is a awesome book,I believe every married and single person need to read this book,it will help to keep love in your relationship if your married, and for the single it will help you to figure out what your love language is, and when GOD bless you with a spouse you can learn their love language.<br /><br />Thank you Gary Chapman!<br /><br />Awesom! Awesome!

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I am using this wonderfully calming app on my 1st generation Kindle Fire and cannot say enough good about it. Of all the apps I have so far, I can honestly say that this one makes a difference in my life. I use it to find calm in the midst of a hectic day and to unwind at the end of a crazy day I thought would never end. It helps me close out all the sounds around me in this busy urban place as well as helping me still the thoughts that should have long been left behind.<br /><br />I have been in contact with the developer and understand that there will soon be an updated version for the new Kindle Fire HD, which I have coming late October. YAY!... I mean, \\"Ohhhhmmmm\\"<br /><br />I peacefully recommend this app; see if it makes a difference in your life. : )

B004HW7JMY|4.0|What is a truly excellent story line is continuously plagued by the fact that you already know the fate of many of the characters. This is also very much a positive thing but it leaves one with a nagging sense of not completely caring about characters that are doomed. Still, well written, directed and acted so there's not much one can say against those positive attributes.
B009CPIR9K|5.0|At first I wasn't too sure if I would like this movie and it could have gone in several different directions. However, after 15 minutes of watching it and I was hooked. I think Iron Sky has some very intelligent and subtle undertones that show how ridiculous we are as human beings, being peer pressured, false assumptions, and moronic group mentality that is sometimes covered under the guise of nationalism, patriotism, and so-called \\"good\\" causes.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|If I could leave zero stars, I would. The Lifeproof case is a wonderful case. My husband has one, and it has done wonders for him for nearly a year now. So, since I was getting a new iPhone 4S, I ordered this case from amazon and it is a FAKE. It looks real enough...even the package looks like the real thing. But the materials are different and when you try to put it on the phone, the lock/power button is always being pushed. Also, you can't get the mute button to engage. My husband went online to Lifeproof's website and, sure enough, they have a huge problem with this happening. There were tips of what to look for in the box to ensure that the case is genuine, and all of those things were MISSING in this case. In addition, they share that there is only ONE authorized Lifeproof retailer on amazon and it is LIFEPROOF! Don't be sucked in by the so-called savings on this case. Buy the real thing from Lifeproof and it will actually work.
1451696191|4.0|In this charming tale about a high school boy trying to find his way through life, 15 year old Charlie writes letters to an anonymous person explaining the details of his everyday life. Charlie and his friends and family deal with lots of common issues; suicide, drug abuse, pregnancy, sexuality, and more. As Charlie experience his freshman year in high school, he tries to find himself and the people he cares most about.<br /><br />Before I read this book, I heard great things about it, and now that I've read it I can only agree! I thought it was a great portrayal of a young teenage boys life. It was realistic in the way he thought. It wasn't just a typical boy in a typical book. Charlie thinks differently than others; like the book suggests, he's a wallflower. He sees and observes the things and people going on around him. He has a very thoughtful personality with a lot of insight. I think it's something young adults can certainly relate to; all the issues I listed above are relevant to adolescents. You get to see Charlie develop over time; it's exciting to see him get out there and living life! He makes great friends and you can always feel Charlies emotions when he's talking about the people he loves. I also love how it's written in letter form. I think it's very clever and it makes you think. Stephen Chbosky, the author of this book, would also throw funny little paragraphs in here with random information. I loved that, because it really made me think of how those words related to Charlie's life, and how they can even relate to mine. Overall, I thought this was a fantastic book, and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a heartfelt story, a good laugh, and a few tears.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I watched this movie the at the midnight premiere, I read and loved the original book about a year before the actual movie came out and I gotta say that I was somewhat dissapointed. The movie is about a girl named Katniss (duh), her sister was picked for the annual Hunger Games; a fight to the death. Katniss, isn't going to have it so she volunteers to take her place, then the movie starts. I did not enjoy the movie as much as the book, but it was enjoyable.

Folks pay 2 dollar's more and order it on Dish. This is the second time I've been screwed over by Amazon. 5.1 auio means surround sound ( WITH CENTER CHANNEL) plus subwoffer.

B0083SBM7Q|1.0|Great movie, but Amazon's description comparison is misleading. It alludes to the combo packs containing deleted scenes and other features but what they don't tell you is the deleted scenes and other features are only on the Blu-ray disc. They should have clarifed \\"Blu-ray only\\" in the respective sections. Had Amazon not pumped BS into their comparison I would have bought the standard DVD. So...thanks for that, Amazon.
B000B8657S|4.0|Like many here who have commented on the Box Set from Hyperion, I was a bit<br />taken aback by the lack of Graham Johnson's marvelous notes from the individual<br />CDs that were released gradually over the years literally that it took to<br />record the 600 plus songs.<br />Graham's notes are essential, I feel, for enjoying this great musical<br />achievement, he is without doubt the pre-eminent expert/scholar/accompanist<br />in all things Franz Schubert, and accomanies EVERY selection, except for<br />the several acappela selections.<br />His notes are a rare and treasured aspect of this project, EVERY SONG,<br />EVERY SELECTION, has background information, and the notes also include<br />period drawings, photos, etc. from that period.<br />** Beware though.  I made the decision to also collect ALL of the individual<br />CDS.  I had to purchase MANY of them USED, since the FIRST EDITIONS OF THE<br />INDIVIDUAL CDS are no longer issued by Hyperion.  The subsequent individual<br />CDs from Hyperion have also deleted the Graham Johnson's notes, and refer you to an<br />internet site if you want to read them.<br />I wanted them in print, and just recently succeeded in completing the<br />entire set of 38 CDS, the 38th Box Set has 3 cds of songs by Schubert's<br />contemporaries from many of the same poets/authors.<br />I had to purchase three copies of Edition 35 until I found a fourth copy<br />back east from Dearborn Music, that was a first edition.<br />Around I believe edition 25, Graham's notes became so extensive, that Hyperion<br />had to do a box set, rather than the usual plastic CD cover for one CD, because<br />the booklet was so thick.  So all of the first editions from about CD 25 through<br />CD 38 are Box Sets, and are most wonderful.<br />Quite a few I was able to purchase on Amazon, some locally, and now I have<br />all the FIRST EDITIONS.<br />I had to buy three of the Janet Baker first editions, and ended up with the<br />Hyperion current releasewhich has deleted Johnson's notes, they are on the<br />internet, and found two First Editions which have Johnson's notes, and the<br />lovely photo of Janet Baker with Graham Johnson.<br />**  What a thrill that this great singer, just BEFORE SHE RETIRED<br />COMPLETELY, came forward to do the first CD of this marvelous Compilation.<br />I sang professionally and can be seen/heard on youtube.com.  Schubert's songs<br />have always been important and dear to me, and now I am discovering songs<br />that I have never heard.<br />If you really want the true Hyperion Schubert Edition, you may want to collect<br />all of the FIRST EDITIONS.  Graham Johnson himself states that he wanted the<br />complete Set to be like this, like a series of mini-recitals.<br />** The Complete Set by Hyperion however, remains in invaluable Enclopedia<br />of all of Schubert's Songs, and other vocal music.<br />I personally feel that having ALL THE FIRST EDITIONS is also marvelous<br />and am so glad I was able to find them all.<br />Anthony Plumer
0345536886|5.0|I have always enjoyed John Grisham's books. However, I had gotten away from them because they had always consisted of the same theme, the law. I know! He's a lawyer and he writes what he knows about. Yet, sometimes one needs to change ones interests even in ones reading. So, one day while grocery shopping, I saw this book, The Litagators, and decided to revisit some of Mr. Grisham's work. I can say that I, thoroughly, enjoyed this book from start to finish. It held me captive from the very beginning. I have recommended this book to several people and so far everyone has enjoyed it, immensely.
1609611543|5.0|There is a reason this book has hundreds of 5 star reviews. Because if you stop eating wheat, the fat melts off you, FAST.<br />I have always done tons of exercise and never really looked that fit.<br />Stopped eating wheat for 8 weeks, and continued the exercise and now I'm RIPPED.<br />The reason I like this book is because people have said \\"eat less carbs\\" for years, but it is SO hard to do.<br />This book explains why it's so hard to do, and WHY you have to go cold turkey on wheat because it is as addictive as illicit drugs.<br />Combine the guidelines from this book, and workout HARD, and I guarantee you will be ripped.

B0091THRCU|1.0|This is a poor quality product. As others have stated PU Leather is not real leather. The design is poor. The mechanism for pulling out the phone does work very well. Build quality was extremely poor. Upon receipt I noticed stitching on one case was unraveled and missing for the top 3/8\\". The inside has the hard stuff, apparently excess glue, that would likely damage the iPhone as the phone was inserted and removed from the case. The stitching on the card holder was uneven and sloppy. I have a Sena iPhone 4S case and it was much better in every respect. I returned the Snugg case for a refund to amazon.com. I ordered the Sena true leather case which is much better and will not scratch the iPhone 5. (...)

Oh. and after I get the canary to drop. You get the idea. Don't pick up this game if you have somewhere to go or if you're spouse wants to talk. to you or if you're in a job interview or piloting an airplane. DO take it to the loo or the DMV!
0743289692|5.0|This book goes a long way to explain what is happening in our world, and it's pretty scary for a lot of reasons.  Still, it's a book of hope:  of one young woman who transcends her cultural background to survive and thrive.  Very brave she was!  And who knew about Theo Van Gogh, yes the grandson of the famous artist, that he was assassinated?
B0001I55SS|4.0|Loved this movie a lot as a kid! An old but great, well made sci fi thriller for kids that are more along the lines of Alien and Event Horizon without the pure evil and spilled gut. The set designs are awesome and inspiring, I made lots of legos of the main ship that I twisted to bits upon completion - simulating gravitational pull. The main ship looks like a mix between a Victorian greenhouse and the Eifel tower, filled with killer robots and zombie munks. Whats more awesome than that when you are 10?<br />This movie is best enjoyed on Halloween I think.<br />Watching it again as an adult, it looks very dated and cheesy, especially the dialog that comes out of the robot called Vincent. The ending is also weak but from what I heard, they made it up as they ran out of time.
1451627297|4.0|...it's still really good.  Full disclosure: I remember 11/22/63 vividly.  My 12th birthday party was cancelled for obvious reasons. I`ve read many of King's books, esp. his earlier ones.  The Stand is an epic story and, still in my opinion, his best.  Certainly, my favorite of all that I've read. His most recent book has all of his character development and the tension and fascination with what comes next, but I was disappointed with the ending. Still, a very good read!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|didn't know what to expect when I downloaded app but really enjoy it. run out of coins fast though. have to limit play so I don't run out before I get daily bonus
B00866JL96|5.0|good adaptation of the book, but I wish the dog had had a bigger role.  Good Chemistry between the stars.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book but I wish the main characters were not sixteen....not really how sixteen year olds act...but still loved it
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I was worried this would be a spin-off of the Transformer series, but the movie was not. Acting and the plot were really good. The picture and sound are as good as it gets. If you like the alien invasion plot and lots of action this is a great movie for your collection. I only wished there had been a 3D version.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addicting &amp; fun! Although there's an option to purchase coins...the game enables you to keep playing by selling prizes you've won or simply waiting until they give you more. Assumed it would get boring pretty quickly but it doesn't!  Super fun...and you can't beat the price &infin;FREE&infin; Try it!
B0085MNZ66|3.0|first to rate this app<br /><br />its ok the UI is a bit basic and laggy. there's no instructions on how to play which cost them 1 more star...<br /><br />there's also no types of hints which cost them another star.<br /><br />its ok to pass time around with. would it be my first game of choice to kill time? maybe not... but its decent. definitely not worth buying... it has better value being free on the Amazon market.<br /><br />they do have room to improve.

B009GENZKS|5.0|Great story better than all the real life films, I would love to see more R.E. films like this. I would also like to see CG films that are remakes of the games 1-6. They should have a series or something. Also the next film needs to have Chris & Jill in it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Here's The Lowedown on \\"The Avengers\\" (A Fantasy/Comic book DVD review)...LOVED IT!!!!<br /><br />Become a fan of \\"The Lowedown\\" on Facebook!!<br /><br />Genre: 10 Movie: 8.5<br /><br />What's it about?<br />Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.<br /><br />What did I think?<br />I have been waiting for this since the first Iron Man was released.  They played it exactly right by releasing films of all the others by themselves, then dropping Avengers on us like a Dimensional portal from Hell.  Hold onto your seats, cause this will tear the fabric of space with all the action in it.  You should watch Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America to get a handle on this one, or it might be too busy with all the characters.  It made 1.5 Billion in the box office...if anything was made for a blu-ray player...it was this!
B0000AUHOH|3.0|\\"Star Trek V\\" was panned by critics (the same critics who praised the ridiculous and torturously dull fourth movie) because the plot was hard to follow. And it's true, the plot is jumbled for about the first hour. Even so, one should appreciate the director's attempt to stay faithful to the Enterprise's mission of \\"boldly going where no man has gone before,\\" instead of focusing on Kirk's relationship with Spock, diplomatic squabbles with other alien species, or trendy 20th century issues like saving the whales. And the ending is great. Of all of the movies with the original cast, this is my third favorite. It is overlooked by fans and undeservedly so.
0525953728|5.0|I think everyone should understand what our military goes through to accomplish their goals that protect our country.  Instead of decreasing the military budget they should leave it alone.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I read it in one one because I was unable to put it down. I fell in love with all the characters and would read it again. I don't ever reread books, but this one is worth it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I must say, this film took me completely by surprise - and in a wonderful way!  The marketing had led me to think this was a comedy about a handful of older Brits who moved to India and then experienced culture shock in a slapstick way.  To be honest, with such a scenario I wouldn't have gotten this film at all were it not for the cast.  I am such a huge fan of all of these actors, so I figured anything with Judy Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith was worth seeing - no matter how lame the material.  Was I ever wrong about the material and the story!<br /><br />This is an incredible film about re-purposing one's life, about taking risks and making changes no matter what age and about that even when things don't turn out as expected, often better things come instead.<br /><br />Set in India, the film is so visually stunning and I loved the soundtrack so much, I ordered that too.  Most important, it deals with change, with loss, with acceptance, with redemption and forgiveness, with holding on to what matters and letting go to what doesn't.  The trick, of course, is for each viewer to figure out those in his/her own life.  Each of the characters in this film must figure these out too.  In less deft hands, this COULD have been \\"strange old Brits in a strange new land,\\" but thanks to a great story and a great director, and such a strong, expert cast, this movie is so much more.<br /><br />Although I am not yet the age of the characters, this film moved me tremendously and gave me such hope and optimism for that rapidly approaching time.  My new mantra is \\"Everything turns out all right in the end.  If it's not all right, it's not the end.\\"
B008N5UX9M|2.0|I totally respect any, and all, attempts at music. I am a musician myself. It's hard to put something together and have everybody on the same page. Sometimes I wonder what is going through artists heads when they put a project together like this. Maybe Mr. Harris' ears are damaged from playing with Maiden for so long. I have travelled to Europe to see Maiden. I guess that you can say I like them. The singer on this is the weak link. It totally doesn't fit in any rock type song. He doesn't have a bad voice. It just doesn't fit! I don't forsee any awards upcoming for this cut. Oh well! Keep doing a good job with Maiden and I'll be more than happy!!! Good luck!
B003O86FMW|4.0|And the saga continues. Very similar to the first in it's series. Keeps me<br />wanting more. I am enjoying the trilogy.
B008N5UX9M|5.0|Ok, so I'm not an Iron Maiden \\"super fan.\\" I've never worn any of their t-shirts, and I haven't seen  them live (not by choice - the one time they came to town I just couldn't make it.)  I only own a couple of their albums right now, but I've heard a good share. In spite of all that, I'm a big fan, and I have HUGE respect for them, as any self-respecting metalhead should.<br /><br />Now, maybe I'm biased because I'm a bass player myself, but I like this album a lot. If you were to give it a label, I'd say it's \\"progg-ish, melodic modern rock.\\"<br /><br />The bass is louder in the mix than on your average rock record. We're used to hearing the clang of Steve's bass on Maiden, but this material is very different. So it's a bit odd to have the bass so loud, but I don't think it kills it. Again, maybe I'm biased.<br /><br />And the singer is clearly not the most powerful one you'll hear, but his tone and delivery fit the tamer, more brooding type of rock that this album is exploring.<br /><br />I think that the fact that Steve can write in a different style, and assemble a different type of band and make it sound good is a testament to his talent, even if you don't particularly like the style.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was expecting a dry account full of technical details.  Instead I found a really compelling story written by a master story teller.  Mark Owen has the ability to draw pictures with his words that enable the reader to feel that he/she is right there and seeing the same things that the Seals are experiencing.  I saw no revealing of any National Security Secrets.  I did see the frustration of these extraodinary men with the inability of the current administration to make a decision.  Americans should thank God every day that we have been blessed with men like Seal Team Six who put their lives on the line to protect this country.

B00957T6X6|1.0|My first review, and unfortunately it's a negative one. Despite the shocking high cost, I bought this set and picked up reading in book 2 from my spot in the physical book (which I'd bought recently from amazon before buying a Kindle). However, despite the advertising, the ebook did not contain real page numbers, and it was a huge pain to find my spot. Also, navigation to the various maps and appendices in the 5 books is cumbersome and poorly organized. For instance, viewing the appendix for book 5 loses my reading place in book 2, since it's \\"further.\\" I can't zoom in on the maps, either, which is unacceptable. And this combo does not have X-Ray enabled (though the individually-purchased books do), which is essential for a series like this. Going to the Table of Contents takes you to a master table of contents at the beginning of the ebook rather than the TOC for the individual book you're reading, just making it all more cumbersome. I'm perplexed why this page also says the total page numbers are 819 for all 5 books. Finally, after persevering for a few days, I have returned the bundle tonight, very disappointed with amazon. If they fix these problems, deliver as advertised (and reduce the cost), I will probably try it again. Update: once Amazon adds real page numbers - as advertised! - and enables X-Ray, I will buy it today! How can I get this feedback to the publishers??
0316228532|3.0|First of all, I admire J. K. Rowling's courage to write a totally different novel after having written the most popular fantasy novels in the world. I also appreciate her effort to talk about difficult social issues we face today.<br /><br />Having said that, I have to admit the first 60% of The Casual Vacancy is just dull. I can see her efforts, but her writing style cannot deliver what she wants to tell us. Her characters are mostly two-dimensional and as a result, none of them are interesting enough for us to care. Because she made her characters just caricatures.You just don't feel they are real people.<br /><br />The story picks up the speed in the end, but I still couldn't care about any of the characters.

B008RYN44U|5.0|Upon the first listen, I like every song on this album. Yes, it is a restrained, relaxed, \\"adult\\" version of No Doubt. Gwen has never sounded better. Whether there are big hits on this album remains to be seen but I wouldn't be surprised if there are several: \\"Settle Down\\", \\"Looking Hot\\", \\"One More Summer\\", \\"Heaven\\" all could be. Stylistically it may be more solo Gwen than classic No Doubt but that isn't a bad thing IMO.

0321714113|5.0|C++ Primer, 5th ed. is a great book for an intermediate level C++ programmer. I would NOT recommend this book to a novice, but if you went through an introductory book or two and have some basic programming experience, this book will take you to the next level.<br /><br />The authors introduce STL material from the beginning. So, this book more or less shares pedagogical philosophy with another excellent introductory book \\"Accelerated C++\\" by Koenig & Moo (who is a co-author of this book). IMO, this is a superior approach, compared to a more traditional, part1-C-part2-C++ type of approach.<br /><br />What I like about this book, in particular, is the authors' attention to detail and their pursuit of \\"completeness\\". Not only does the book cover all the basic building blocks of the language, it also describes subtleties and nuances in the language that can easily be missed or misunderstood by showing you lots of easy-to-understand examples. In this sense, I would say that this book contains most of the materials covered in topical books such as \\"Effective C++: 55 ways...\\" by S. Meyers. Althought Meyers' book is a decent one on its own, I feel like you wouldn't really need to read Meyers' book if you go through this book patiently.<br /><br />Well, what I described so far doesn't differ much from what you can find in other reviews for the previous editions. However, newly added materal on the new C++11 extension certainly justifies new edition. The authors give clear explantion of new addtions (such as auto type, decltype, list initialization, rvalue reference, move operator, lambda expression, shared/unique pointers, just to name a few). These new materials are repeatedly used throughout the book, so you will feel very comfortable with these by the time you finish the book. This C++11 extension alone, in my opinion, justifies the price of the book.<br /><br />The book is in its fifth edition, and this shows in the book's clean, organic structure. Fonts and spaces areperfect for a programming book, and cross referencing is very nicely documented so that you can remind yourself of your previous reading 2 weeks ago. Examples are succint and easy to understand, although they tend to be independent snippets of codes rather than parts of a grand scheme.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great intermediate level book on C++. It is the kind of book that you want to keep in your shelf as a reference. I highly recommend this book to those who want to learn C++.

0765365278|1.0|just read all 1007 pages of this book thinking, \\"Oh, this is just a slow spot. It will pick up. The Mistborn Series was amazing.\\" Well, silly me. I just wasted my time because nothing much happens in this book. It's primarily a philosophical exploration of classism, human nature and whether Machiavelli was right. That could make for a great read. However, I found the characters' internal monologues tedious and eventually hackneyed. [Spoiler alert] Oh gee, this character is *still* torn about whether he can truly help the bridge men. Let's read about his inner struggle (again) for another hundred pages.<br /><br />I still loved Mistborn and plan to read more books by this author. But I'm going to be much more careful before I invest the time to read 1007 pages.

160774273X|5.0|Even if you don't make bread this book is a lot of fun.  It is written in order to create success and enjoy your failures.  Ken gets at the heart of any art, be it bread making or jams.  It starts with the love of the experience of trying.  You simply have to dig in and do it. If you screw up, you work on the details.  I am a guy who fell in love with cooking at age 11!  In the military later I was generally the only guy who knew how to throw a football AND cook real food.  My wife has learned never to come between me and good cook book.  This book is informative, has great pictures, great explanations, and a pleasure to look at on the counter.  I live in Oregon so I'm going to have to go to Ken's bakery and get it autographed!  Oh, and the greatest fun of all is the stuff Ken says you should buy.  If you are a veteran like I am - throw the ammunition away and go bake artisan bread.  Great therapy!  July 2015  Just finished another pizza.  This author and his book are amazing.  You can make the simplest of pizzas that will be devoured in minutes.  My pizzas don't look that good since I have trouble making them round (and getting them off the peel), but... are they tasty once I get them into the oven.  My wife ate 2/3rds of the one I made tonight.  The other cool thing is that once you get the hang of it you can crank out three pizzas in about 20 minutes!  I have maybe 55 cook books.  Forkish has written a masterpiece cook book.  ahh, the joys of yeast and carbon dioxide.  Mr Forkish is making me very happy with many more years of joy to come.   Study this book well.  If I'm ever captured by terrorists I'm sure they'll taste the pizza and keep me alive long enough to escape! I wish I could get an autographed copy.

If you're a fan of visual novels, anime, games, good story telling, multiple endings, fun or a fan of being a fan do yourself a favor and play this game. I'm not going into detail because spoiling any possible part of the story would make me a terrible person. There are 5 different endings and a troll ending that simply doesn't allow you to advance for other reasons so you'll be playing this game at least three times through to complete it but I highly advise you go for gold and get all of them. Nuff said. Please play this game.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|This was a good first book. I thought the book was well written. However, the story doesn't end here and I'd like to reserve total star reviews until I've finished the whole series.  There were some underlying themes in the story I am not sure sit real well with me, and I would very much like to give the whole story a chance- not just rate one book in the series.<br /><br />That said, my young adolescent friend is reading this book, after having seen the movie, and thinks it is amazing. Great job by the movie makers for producing a film that made her want to read the book.
B00061QK02|5.0|I love this movie!  It's cheap humor by comic legends and, as far as I'm concerned, there's not much better than that!  I can't wait for the 2nd Anchorman movie to be released.  Stay classy, Amazon...
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Anyone who is reading this by now has likely seen the movie multiple times.  On the off chance that you are one who has not, these are my thoughts.<br /><br />As much as Batman Begins resurrected the Batman movie franchise, this one proved the series could sustain without a letdown.  While I thought that the story in this one was the weakest overall in the Nolan Batman trilogy (I think both Batman Begins and Dark Knight Rises have better \\"beginning to end\\" stories in their respective movies), Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker made this movie an instant classic.  He not only stole every scene he was in, he owned every scene he was in.  He played the psychopath perfectly, and gave you the impression that he was insane yet totally in control of what he was doing.  It was not only the best portrayals of the Joker ever (at least in a tv/film version of Batman) but one of the best acting performances ever.<br /><br />I would have liked for the movie to use Two Face more than they did.  I think Aaron Eckhart did a good job with the character, but he was really only in the last 45 min or so of the movie.  Personally I would have liked them to keep him alive but locked away and then revisit the character in Dark Knight Rises.  I think he would have been perfect in the role they gave Dr. Crane in Dark Knight rises (or even an expanded version of that role).  That said however, I think they did a good job with the character for the limited time he was used.<br /><br />I think what is great about this movie is that it appeals to a wider audience than just fans of superhero movies.  I think that the first Batman movie back in 1989 did that, as well as Batman Return (although to a lesser extent).  After that, only hardcore superhero and/or comic book fans were going to be the ones seeing the Batman movies.  Everyone knows how Batman Forever and Batman and Robin nearly killed off the franchise.  Because of Nolan's great storytelling, the superb acting and bringing an element of realism to the story (as much as possible anyway) that had been lost, this movie is well worth adding to your collection.of realism to the story (as much as possible anyway) that had been lost, this movie is well worth adding to your collection.
0439023521|5.0|I had not planned on reading The Hunger Games.  I didn't see the need to read a 24 kids enter one kid leaves story.  However when the movie came out on video I figured I'd see what all the fuss was about; and being a purest, I figured I'd better read the book first.<br /><br />The book ended up being great.  I had read so many reviews that said basically it's about a competition where 24 kids killing each other until one is left.  No it's not.  The Games don't even start until 2/3 of the book is gone.  It's a book about social injustice, power, greed, the fear of loss of power.  The social commentary of this book is what makes it great.<br /><br />If you are considering this book for a younger person the violent aspects of it should be taken under consideration.  Although the more violent parts of the book are handled with a fairly light touch.  The main consideration for age would be that I would not recommend this book to anyone who is not old enough to understand the social injustice that is happening right now in our word.  Without an understanding of that, The Hunger Games is only an entertaining book.  With that understanding it is a meaningful and intriguing social commentary.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Great inspirational story of a young woman finding out how strong she really is..physically and emotionally.  Super fast and easy read.
0439023491|3.0|After enjoying The Hunger Games, I was looking forward to reading Catching Fire.  It stated out well enough.  Many of the questions left unanswered from the previous book were addressed.  There were some interesting twists.  Then it kind of when down hill from there.  I wonder if that is when Collins found out they were going to make movies of the books and she started concerning herself more with how it would look on a screen than how good the writing was.<br /><br />The underlying themes that made The Hunger Games such a great book have been mostly abandoned in the first half of this book and given up on completely by the time we get to the second games.<br /><br />The book was still fairly entertaining, so I'll give it some credit for that.  Having read all three books,  I wish I has stopped in the middle of this one.  Or better yet, I wish l had just found someone else who had read this one and let them answer the few questions I had unanswered from The Hunger Games and left it at that.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|a very fun game even though you have to wait after you use up all of the coins given at the start of the game.
0439023513|2.0|This book goes to prove that sometimes it's better not to make your story a trilogy.  This book was almost as bad as The Hunger Games was good.  The book seemed rushed, and at times disjointed.  It was not as well written or edited as the first two.<br /><br />All underlying themes from the first two books have been abandoned.  This book seemed just for the purpose of rounding out a trilogy and making an action packed 3rd movie.  The violence, which was handled quite gracefully in the first book, is told in much, much more vivid detail than the previous two books.  There seems to be a lot of violence just for the sake of shock value.  There is quite a bit of violence against children.<br /><br />With the end of the series, characters have become expendable and are dropping left and right with very little exposition of their deaths.  There is a point in the book where Katniss just can't take thinking about all the dead.  I truly wondered if it was actually this or Collins just didn't want to take the time, nor had the skill to deal with it.  The biggest loss, with the flippancy with which the characters were handled, was the fact that I no longer liked Katniss by the end of the book.  By the end of the series Katniss is way more like Rambo, in the second and third movies, than the girl at the end of The Hunger Games.<br /><br />I'll refrain from giving this one star because I guess there still was some entertainment value, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this book.

I'm giving this set 3 stars because I don't recommend you buy all three books.  I personally only recommend The Hunger Games, and maybe the first half of Catching Fire (up top the point they start the games in that book).  If you want to know what happens after that, look it up or ask someone who read it.  The third book is not well written nor a logical, probable, or fulfilling conclusion to the series.

The best part of this book is that the author openly discusses his apprehensions and shortcomings through every step of the process.  This is a marked change from the egotistical stance given by most special ops story tellers. A good read if you want to know a little more about the Seal Team 6 selection process, the life of the top-tier special operators, and a blow by blow account of the day the US chose to take down one of the worst criminals in our history. An extremely quick read.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|All the negative reviews for this season are baffling to me.  Before I watched I read a lot of people online saying it was boring.  I've now watched the whole second season and \\"boring\\" is the last word I would use to describe it.  There was a little less action than the first season, but there was still plenty.  It makes sense that as a show like this goes on, they must delve into the growth of the characters, their motivations, relationships, etc.  It can't just be all action, all the time, zombies chasing people around ad nauseum.  After not much time, that would get pretty old.  This season is interspersed with periods of downtime for the main characters to recoup just enough to be taken by surprise when the next horrible thing happens to them.<br /><br />I found myself agonizing over the decisions they had to make, feeling as conflicted as the characters were portrayed to feel in the confusion of adapting to this new world where survival is the main objective.  Do the old rules still apply?  Can they apply?  There were lots of very tense and scary scenes.  Lots of characters lost their lives, including several leading characters, and some new ones were added.  There were some great WTH moments, several things remaining a mystery to be resolved next season.  As much as I enjoyed the first season (though really \\"enjoyed\\" is not the right word), I liked this one even better.  I'm looking forward to tuning in to season 3.

B008RV5K4U|4.0|I really enjoyed Batman DKR. The animation and voice acting were both above-par. Peter Weller did a great job as an aging Bats. A convincing performance, he transformed into the role rather than simply reminding that \\"oh yeah, this is the guy who was Robocop a long time ago.\\"  I realize it's an adaption of F Millers classic, but some of the characters and political discourse is really dated, like watching blade runner for the first time 20 years after it was made. They wanted to keep close to the source material but the staying power of this film would've been increased if they updated a few things (Robin, speech and design of some of the thugs and some of the slang- just my opinion, I'm sure I'd feel differently if I had a closer connection with the source material). Good story and art, but not the holy grail of comics as some portray it. Not something I'd view multiple times, but a fun watch. And that's all I've got.

I think it shows growth in a band when they can keep their sound and expand on it giving you something different with every album.
B005AUWY90|3.0|When a child-friendly movie can make kids laugh and cry while also entertaining and emotionally affecting adults, you have a winner, and this was Pixar's claim to fame. My personal list of DVDs and Blu-rays is color coded to indicate my level of enjoyment of each film.  The entire Pixar section of my list was solid blue, as in blue ribbon. But after an unexpected (by me) and phenomenal eleven straight Pixar feature-length movies \\"in the blue\\", Cars 2 broke the color barrier in my listing.<br /><br />Technically, the Blu-ray is reference quality in both picture and sound, but the other pillar of Pixar's success, an engaging story, sputtered in this sequel to the original Cars movie. With its overly frenetic activity and frequently loud soundtrack, Cars 2 seems to be aimed squarely at the Attention Deficit Disorder generation.  This might be a winning formula for today's audience, but it is not a formula for a timeless classic.  Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., or any of the Toy Story trilogy will still be loved by kids and adults fifty years from now.  Cars 2 will not be so favored.<br /><br />Despite this hopefully temporary setback in Pixar's storytelling record, Cars 2 is still as good or better than almost anything from other contemporary animation studios.  Perhaps the most significant observation would not be that Pixar has had a fumble, but rather that they carried the ball for such a long time and with such consistent advances in audio/visual and narrative technique.  It is my hope and expectation that Pixar will go onward and upward with their technical wizardry, but back to their founding emotional core for their approach to storytelling.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|I haven't thought of Robert Plant for a hundred years. Last year, at Bonnaroo, I went to see his set hoping he'd play a Zep song or two. Surprise surprise. The audience collectively was truly stunned at this concert, which was perfection on stage. The audience was looking at each other, saying \\"Can you believe this is real?  Holy S...\\"  Goosebumps.<br /><br />Leave it to Plant to reinvent himself with such talented musicians, who seemed to be born to play with each other. B of J is an Americana act, which to me would sound boring but the warmth and soulfulness and groove were intense. Dare I use the term spiritual experience? I didn't know one of these songs and wondered how much better the concert would have been if I had been more familiar with them. Miller on Guitar, Griffin on vocals with Plant. Amazing.<br /><br />So I bought the album when I got home. It's great for a variety of reasons you could read in other reviews.  However, they probably sold six copies because this will never get airplay. Acts with older musicians don't get played. Sad because it's my pick for best album of the last few years. Buy the album if for no other reason than to learn the songs so you can get more out of seeing B of J live if they ever play again.
B000001ES9|5.0|This album was released in 1974 by a high caliber power trio and still one of the leading performing acts that Canada has ever produced, RUSH.<br /><br />I read, \\"Rush were fans of such bands as Led Zeppelin and Cream, and these influences can be heard in most of the songs on this debut. Original Rush drummer John Rutsey performed all drum parts on the album, but was unable to go on extended tours because of diabetes and left the band after the album was released. Rutsey wrote some lyrics for the debut, but never submitted them to the band and some new lyrics had to be thrown together. He was soon replaced by Neil Peart.\\"<br /><br />Each musician has over the years proven their superb musicianship, but I have always loved the raw sound of this first release. Even though their style changed once Neil joined the band, and Neil is definitely by far a much better drummer than John Rutsey,and critics have touted their later works as better, I still like the early works. Something about 70's rock and roll that completes me.<br /><br />Rush have had a fabulous career with numerous awards and accolades,<br /><br />\\"They were voted the group who has made the most significant contributions to the Canadian music industry both domestically and internationally in the period 1980- to 1989.\\"<br /><br />\\"January 2000, RUSH has topped JAM! Music's online poll, which determines them \\"Best Canadian Musicians of All Time.\\"<br /><br />I agree, they are a consistent, hard working band who constantly wow fans worldwide with their live performances which are unbelievable to behold.<br /><br />I am lucky to own the complete Rush catalog, but it would not be complete without this debut.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I love this band. In This Moment has the best lyrics. I have their previous albums and I have to say it has never been a disappointment. This album is amazing. I was able to get this album for an amazing price at Amazon MP3 Store. I actually canceled other mp3 music memberships that I had, since I get better deals here at amazon.
B000002MTU|5.0|They are not his songs but in his usual laid back style he challenges himself playing the songs from some of the greatest bluesmen of all time, and makes them his own.<br /><br />\\"From the Cradle\\" was released in 1994. It contains sixteen covers of songs by legendary Bluesmen, like Leroy Carr (\\"Blues Before Sunrise\\", \\"How Long Blues\\"), Muddy Waters (\\"Standin' Round Crying\\"), and Willie Dixon (\\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", \\"Groaning the Blues\\").<br /><br />Nearly every album Clapton's ever done has had a suggestion of his roots. But there's more than a suggestion of blues in this offering. \\"FROM THE CRADLE\\" won the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album.<br /><br />They are raw, stripped down performances, which proves that Clapton has the heart of a bluesman. He feels the music,and tries to perfect it by keeping it pure. Pure emotion,uncluttered, stellar guitar playing.<br /><br />\\"I went into the studio with the approach that everything would be recorded live, and having chosen the songs, we would play them as much like the original versions as possible, even down to the key they were played in.

B00009ATIX|5.0|In 2002, fresh from the box office success of Oceans 11 (worldwide gross $450M) Steven Soderbergh was able to cash in some of his directorial chips and get a more personal project made. Taken from a 1961 science fiction novel of the same name by the Polish writer Stanislaw Lem, and bearing some resemblance to the lengthy 1972 version by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, Soderbergh's Solaris was certainly a long way from Brat pack hijinks. Costing $47M to make and miss-marketed as a romance amongst the stars between its charismatic leads, George Clooney and Natascha McElhone, Solaris was at once more and less than it seemed. Despite critical plaudits its uncompromising exploration of existential angst left audiences cold and with a paltry $15M at the box office it soon disappeared from screens.<br /><br />A synopsis sounds fairly pedestrian and gives little clue to the complexity of subject matter and emotion that unfold; after receiving a mysterious distress call from an old friend on a space station in orbit around the planet Solaris, psychologist Chris Kelvin (Clooney) journeys to Solaris in an attempt to understand what has happened and bring the remaining occupants back to Earth. Arriving there he finds everything in a state of disarray and none of the survivors will tell him what is going on; \\"Until it happens to you, there's really no point in discussing it\\".<br /><br />Solaris is a swirling mass of sentient energy and acts as if it were a kind of collective unconscious for the space station's occupants by manifesting their most powerful desires; the person they long for yet fear the most in their dreams appears in their waking lives. For Kelvin this is Rheya, the wife he lost to suicide 7 years previously after he walked out on her, and he awakes to find a recreated version of her based on his memories. The movie plays out their relationship both in the past and the present and gives Kelvin the chance to reassess his life and his feelings for Rheya.<br /><br />Clooney is masterful in a very challenging role; he plays confusion, fear, guilt, longing, loss and a myriad of other nuanced emotions which go against the grain of his usual performances. In promotional interviews he explained he was exhausted from his first directorial effort \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\\" and the fatigue he felt added to his portrayal of Kelvin, a man broken by grief and regret.<br /><br />Natascha McElhone as Rheya is compulsively watchable even as her performance sometimes raises questions as to its merit. Early on we see her with the luminous eyes, high cheekbones and sensual charm we have come to expect, yet when she appears later as a figment of Kelvin's memory she is almost as if a child, stripped of her charm, self assurance and guile. I had some doubts about the validity of her performance here and got the feeling she was at times sharing an in-joke with Clooney, but she is never less than interesting.<br /><br />The ambient score by Cliff Martinez is outstanding, a hypnotic, haunting and deeply moving soundtrack that adds immense depth to the experience, whilst the oceanic Solaris is breathtakingly beautiful and presents a mesmerizing visual metaphor for the unconscious, and your reaction to the movie may well depend on what swirls deep within yours.<br /><br />The movie touches upon big ticket items like forgiveness, the nature of memory and identity, the creative powers of the mind and the meaning of life itself. If like me your life has been touched by grief and perhaps even guilt and regret then you may find its overriding theme of love, loss and redemption an extraordinarily therapeutic experience. The transcendent final moment makes me cry every time; \\"Everything is forgiven. Everything\\".<br /><br />There are many ways to judge movies, and by most criteria Solaris is not a great one; however if we judge a movie by how we react to it, by what it makes us feel and what we take away from it, and whether its themes haunt, inhabit and continue to change us, then to my mind Solaris ranks amongst the best and is one I return to time and time again as I seek to understand the themes of my life.

0316228532|5.0|This book draws the reader in slowly. It's 500 pages, and plenty of time is given to get to know the various characters in the town and their stories and interconnections. Rowling creates a masterful web. After a certain point I couldn't put the book down--- the tension continues building and building all over the town, and I was desperate to find out what was going to happen to everyone, particularly with a couple of the characters that I cared about deeply, but also with a couple of characters I hoped to see fall!<br /><br />Rowling understands human beings, our limitations, and what a mixed bag we are of pettiness, and self-absorption, and (sometimes) the ability to change and grow, and (sometimes) greatness. The story is believable, with no jarring false notes, even though it fits the expected pattern with rising action, intense climax, and conclusion with enough resolution. There are no neat answers, though, about how to \\"fix\\" society's problems--- the story is very realistic about the many layers of complicated issues and the limitations of individual human beings and of society.<br /><br />I loved the Harry Potter books, so I rushed out to buy this on the day it came out. But, if someone had given me this book and somehow hidden the author's identity from me, it would not have occurred to me that it was written by the author of the Harry Potter series--- the author's voice is that different! I'm amazed at J.K. Rowling's creativity, writing talents, and abilities. I will look forward to reading whatever she writes.<br /><br />This book is not like the Harry Potter books, in that it's not the type to be read over and over because it fulfills our deepest longings for fantasy, magic and transformation. But, The Casual Vacancy IS a big story of magic and transformation in its own more ordinary, everyday, and less epic way. And I believe that is what it intends to be. It's a great read. I enjoyed it immensely, and it's the type of book whose characters will stay with me for a long time, because the story asks the big questions and doesn't attempt a neat answer. And that's what the best stories are supposed to do. Cheers to Jo Rowling!
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|this game is super fun but  impossible. it starts going so fast after about 30 seconds actually makes you dizzy and unable to keep up. its really fun but not worth the frustration.  sends you back to the beggining every time you die. no extra lives. they'll eventually fix it I hope. it could be awesome but it SUCKS!  I guess you'll see if you don't believe me then you'll end up on here complaining.  then maybe they fix it. ppppllleeeeaaaassssseeee fix this game
B007D2XSW0|2.0|This app looked st first to be amazing however it will not post pics to my facebook.This is the main reason I purchased this app.went several times to their support vented and emails never went through.I would recommend this app if they fixed the problem.I work hard for my money and it upsets me I cant reach anyone to correct this problem.I know its only 4.99 but its still frustrating.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Need more levels.  It's a cool game.  I,ve enjoyed playing it but am always looking for more.  Where's my water is fun too.  Need more levels there too.

B0053KWDES|5.0|This will make almost any headphone set sound better as long as you use it with the line out dock on the ipod/iphone. I'm not too sure about audiophiles due to a little bit of white noise but I think if you are the average listener with some decent quality headphones, this will surely make you never want to listen to music without an amp.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I liked the well written book which told the story of one of the Navy Seals who was on the Osama Bin Laden search and destroy mission.  The physical and mental challenges these guys go through is extremely impressive.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|My girlfirend and I have enjoyed watching the series since before we were dating. Finding it as such a great price from an amazon trusted seller was amazing. It arrived in a reasonable ammount of time and in excellent unused condition. It made the perfect gift for our 5th anniversary. Complete series is the way to go.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Incredible! Wouldn't change a thing! :)<br /><br />This book is definitely worth reading!! Thought probably slightly more aimed at girls, I'm sure both genders could love it equally.
B005G26NJE|3.0|I love the Bright Lights cut. It is an excellent and soulful tune. Not crazy about the rest of the EP.  Purchased the EP to check Gary Clark Jr out in advance of seeing him perform live at Neil Young's benefit for the Bridge School 10/20 and 10/21/12. I do like the quality of his voice and his guitar playing.

B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was great.  I especially enjoyed learning about the Pacific Crest Trail.  The auther worked through issues in her own life through the hike.  Overall I really enjoyed the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is so good. I couldn't stop reading, I read it in like a day. I wish there were more to the Hunger Games! I loved it, probrably my favorite of the three.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|Best alarm clock app I've come across. I've tried several other alarm clocks from the market, but this is the easiest to customize and use. Definitely recommend !
0061122416|3.0|This is one of those books that seem to appear on nearly every \\"Must read\\" list. So a few years ago, I bought it and read it several times over the past years. I could never get beyond the first 30, then 40 then fifty or so pages. I found the story too slow and tiresome and the writing somewhat laboured. I eventually finished the book last month as it was a Book Club selection. I'm glad I read it because it felt like an achievement but I did not enjoy it as much as others did. To me, it felt more like a self-help book and a high-brow one at that.
1451648537|4.0|I had no idea that Jobs death would impact me in the way it did. I'm far from an Apple devotee, though I have an iPhone and an iPad, and have previously owned an iPod. For a while, I swore off Apple completely; just ask anyone who owned a 2nd-gen iPod and you'll understand.<br /><br />But Jobs death hit me very hard. I was in a funk for days. Not because I think he was a particularly amazing person *as a person*, but because he was a world leader in innovation, in doing things the right way despite the challenges, and for thinking outside the box. It's only natural that someone like Jobs would be revered and hated by so many, and put on something of a pedestal.<br /><br />What I learned from Isaacson's book was that as innovative, creative and idealistic as he was, Jobs was also a troubled soul just like the rest of us. This book humanized Jobs in a way that no amount of rhetoric from Apple diehards or critics ever could. Is it a perfect book? No. Could it have been better? For some yes, for others no.<br /><br />Biographies will never please everyone, especially not those of nigh-religious figures such as Jobs. I got what I wanted from this book, though. I learned more about the man behind the myth, what drove him to be the businessman that he was, and the stories and history behind the bright-white and stainless-steel facade we all saw in the products and advertising.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Jason Kristopher<br />Author of [[ASIN:0983618542 The Dying of the Light: End]]

B008K7WCJM|5.0|I heard of Swans many years ago, but the reviews never captured my interest. They were always written up as being too minimalist for my tastes. Then The Seer popped up on my Amazon recommendations and I was intrigued and almost bought it, just adding it to my wish list for the moment. Then, without a word, my brother sent me the delux edition, which includes a DVD. I haven't watched the DVD yet, so I am just reviewing the 2CD set. It's awesome. The first song, Lunacy, grabbed me immediately. Who doesn't love a bit of lunacy? And at 6:07, it's one of the shorter tracks, so, it is just a bit of insanity compared to what comes after. The title track clocks in at over 32 minutes and takes us through a highly driven cyclical forced worldbeat march described by voice, strings, bagpipes, percussion and more. I found Ave. B Blues to be a bit dull, just screaching, but as part of the album, it serves as a bit of needed relief before the finishing of disc one and then moving to the second disc (boy that's weird, screaching soundscapes serving as relief?). The opening track for disc 2, Song for a Warrior, reminded me of Sid Straw with the Golden Palominos. Then the album just takes off into beautiful oblivion again and again. Throughout the whole ablum, I was reminded of Glen Branca, The Legendary Pink Dots and Jah Wobble, all at their most majestic and darkest deepest most beautiful moments. If you are not familiar with any of the folks I mention, well, you might be better off putting your Billy Joel back on, unless you want to try something really different. If you are familiar with the New York or Euro avante garde scene and always thought it had something to offer, then grab this disc immediately.
0810994739|5.0|My kids and I love reading these books together. It's a great book that connects with kids (I have two boys) and parents (or any adult really.) Author Jeff Kinney really captures the voice and mindset of a 12-year old. And to his credit, he's not nostalgically looking back on what it means to be that age in the 80's or 90's, the stories are set in the present day, but still feature enough universal experiences that anyone who's been through junior high will relate. Also, be sure you go to the wimpy kid website and listen to the Joshie song. I love that one small joke in the book gets its own song online.

B000NDMRCS|2.0|Thankfully I didn't sleep until the day after tomorrow.  I watched - or tried to watch anyway - this big budget piece of environmentalist propaganda because it had reached the \\"everyone has seen it but me\\" kind of critical mass so that I was compelled to see it just so I can say I had.<br /><br />I loved the opening scene when the driller guy is standing there while a huge crack formes in an ice shelf and ends up separating him from his colleagues.  This was just like an \\"Ice Age\\" movie, but with a human and his ice cores rather than a squirrel and an acorn.  But it was downhill from there on.  The problem wasn't that I'm a bit skeptical of the whole global warming thing (at least the part where humans did it and humans can fix it) but rather that I found the characters so dull.  Spectacular effects cannot make up for boring characters, at least not for me.  So, I'll be returning this movie to where I rented it from today, not the day after tomorrow.
B004TMF5EQ|5.0|The producers of this film did an AMAZING job. I believe this is the kind of thing that Imax was made for! I originally had seen this at the Reuben H. Fleet Science center in San Diego a year ago and went looking for it in there store recently. They wanted $40 for it!! Started looking on Amazon and discovered Prime instant videos and got it for $15!! I love this film and would recommend it to anyone who likes seeing great high quality shots of space and learning about how small we really are on this place called Earth. Very well done.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Wow, you'd think this was \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" after reading some of these reviews.  I watched Battleship last night with my expectations set to low and was surprised at how entertaining it was.  Sure, it's implausible, no...actually quite far fetched, but then it's an alien invasion movie and there are a lot of worse ones out there than this.<br /><br />So -- assuming you didn't pay full admission at a theater a while back to see this cliche ridden sci-fi spectacular -- sit back, suspend your disbelief, and enjoy.  I can't wait for the movie adaptation of Angry Birds.
B004RPRXV8|5.0|If you are into fantasy story lines, this is the book for you!  I enjoyed this book a lot because of the intricate plot, it also taught me a lot of new things!
B00846REIS|4.0|The book did keep my interest. However, I do not like when the book stops in the middle of a story. The book left several issues unresolved and did not tie up any of the loose ends. This now makes me feel as if the author purposely cut a larger novel in three pieces just to have more sales. If this is the case, please at least try to give the reader some resolution before the next book comes out.
B008NMT684|3.0|Wish the cars and vehicles were police cars, firetrucks, mail trucks, garbage trucks, etc. My little doesn't get excited for plain colored cars. Still beneficial for him to play but it is not his favorite.

B003ZJUIGO|5.0|If there is only 1 single disc collection of Deep Purple to get out there it's this.  Now fully remastered and expanded, and with a bonus dvd of videos and interviews with Jon Lord, the dvd is just the icing on the cake.  Pick this up cheaper from a marketplace seller, the dvd is that valuable.
B008HK3XKO|1.0|I bought this for my new Kindle HD. For $25.00 I expected a better quality product. The material on the front is wavy and just looks like a bad job by the factory. I'm going to bet with labor and materials they are making $20.00 per unit. This is coming back, Amazon.
1250007305|2.0|I started this thinking it was another high tech thriller (Crichton, Daniel Suarez) and what I got was 250 pages of Network Security for Dummies and 50 pages of some of network TV quality action.<br /><br />The book is a fairly easy read.  For his first Fiction novel, author Mark Russinovich does show a lot of promise.  The plot was very predictable and I found few surprises, but despite this he managed to keep the story moving.  This kept me from ever considering setting the book aside for something else.<br /><br />I also found Russinovich's dialog to be flat, almost robotic at times.  He managed to create a develop several good characters early on, but much of the character interaction felt contrived.<br /><br />Overall I felt this was an decent book for tech geeks, but readers looking for a page turning thriller should look elsewhere. While this is not one I'm going to be passing along to all my friends to read, Russinovich showed enough promise that I will be picking up the sequel down the road.
B00506NRBS|5.0|I finished the book in two days while I traveled to Siem Reap. The book is short but very good book to read. It gave me any ideas to apply in my own start-up.<br /><br />I also do a full review on my blog: [...]<br /><br />And the most amazing is that I wrote to Derek and the next few days after, I received his reply back. That's amazing, he also spent time on my blog to review and gave me some ideas on how to improve it.<br /><br />This book is definitive a must-read.
1401324649|5.0|Wow, what a delightful book!  This really was a pleasant surprise.  The book is about an old man who climbs out the window of his nursing home on his 100th Birthday in order to embark on an adventure.  We learn about the main character: Allan Karlsson's adventurous and hilarious past.  This book kind of reminds me of Forest Gump.  It is truly a remarkable and funny book. I would have never thought a book like this would interest me, but I have to say it is one of my all time favourite books now!  I highly recommend this book.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Too short and not enough information in the book. Left you with more questions then answers. Cowriter did most of the work.
B007SGM084|5.0|When I first starting reading this book I kept putting it down feeling this is not the type of book i'd read.But the teacher in me would not let it go because I knew it was a reason this young man became like this and I just had to know the answer.Also the Sherlock Holmes in me had to read on to see if some of my predictions was right.As I went on reading all three books I was satisfied on both fronts.And in the end I was glad he found true love with someone he could not buy nor manipulate.I then proceeded on to take the name of the book to my book club,and buying the trilogy for my friend in the book club for her birthday present.I'm now awaiting our book summery...can't wait!!!!
0307386171|4.0|This is a very good read and the kind you might like to do in one sitting. It is lyrical and has its own mood that holds up throughout the entire piece. Very clean, organized piece of work and needs to be praised.<br /><br />The charachters and their situation is human, honest and real for that time. Luckily they do not end up together so the ending remains liberating and smart, hardly tragic. Sometimes waiting in love is not a great idea.<br /><br />Ian McEwan is a powerful writer, I like the way his charachters are often flawed, how one incident seems to break the bank and how the reader gets involved in rewriting the script.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day offers a rare insight into the meticulous, strenous training required of the elite combat units of our military.  Revealing prehaps more that it should about weaponry, tools, and strategy, the book details the incredible intelligence gathering and planning skills of those who are apolitical and dedicated only to the mission at hand.  Having said that, the personal insights and observations of current political and military leaders by the author and his fellow Seals are both revealing and humorous.  This is a great book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|That was an excellent read and really enjoyed the information it showed me about the Navy.  I did not think that it revealed any secrets just like most critics would say.
0525953728|4.0|The narrative was as I expected...no real surprises. I certainly don't understand all of the White House to do. For sure I read not a that we haven't read elsewhere. It's good to have the complete story put together in one place.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed how the author built this world; it was very easy to picture it in my mind.  All of the districts, some starving, some being trained to be warriors.  But all of them giving up their children, for the residents of the Capitol to have something to bet on and to be entertained by.  To watch your children fight for their lives, to see them massacred in horrible ways, and then how the residents of the Capitol don't even relate it to children dying; it's what they were doing at the time...\\"I was having my eyebrows waxed\\", \\"I was in the tub\\".  It really brings it home how little the Capitol thinks about the districts.  The districts exist to provide for them; that is the only reason.  As for the relationship between Peeta and Katniss, it was obvious pretty early that Peeta wasn't playing; he really loved Katniss.  And by pretending to have feelings, she really did develop feelings for him, too.  Watching that relationship grow was brilliant; they were so sweet and comforting to each other.  My heart was breaking for Peeta when Katniss was kissing him on the stage.  He was really in love with her, and she is thinking how scared she is.  It was an enjoyable book; the characters and the environment were extremely interesting.  Overall a good read!
B0096HID5M|2.0|I purchased the movie (which I regret) due to the fact that I thought it was a movie about various bands yet also had good music and a large cast. It did have good music yet I also felt like I was watching Glee gone bad. I could not take myself to watch the entire thing I had to keep fast fowarding some of the songs. You can only take so many talk-sing moments.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the Hunger Games series, but I really liked the relationship development between Peeta and Katniss in this book.  I just love Peeta, he is so sweet!
B008XG1X18|2.0|This app has locked up my kindle fire 3 times! (you'd think I would've learned after the first two).<br />Very frustrating since it's such a fun website.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|There was a lot of things going on in this book, it was kind of hard to keep track of everything.  And Katniss spent so much time AWAY from Peeta and WITH Gale, I was afraid she would end up with Gale.  I didn't like how she just left it up to everyone else to get Peeta's mind healed.  She pretty much just walked out on him.  I know it was because she couldn't bear the thought of him hating her, and it hurt her to be around him, but he would never have done that to her.  I just wanted to smack her a couple of times.  And FINNICK DIED???  Really???  Annie couldn't even take care of herself, and now she has a baby to take care of too?  That was just really terrible.  Finnick paid his dues, many times over, to the Capitol, he should have been allowed to be happy.  I wish there had been more about the relationship of Peeta and Katniss, once they were both back at the Victor's Village.  It would have been nice to see how they struggled along to get back to being together, and to watch Katniss realize she DID love Peeta; instead of just hearing it at the end.

B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I both read the book and watched the movie. I wasn't really impressed by either to be honest. Katniss seems selfish and whiny to me. I know everyone seemed to have hunger games fever, but I'm just not sold. Overall I thought it was ok.

B0085MNZ66|1.0|At first glance, seems like dozens of other apps.  I assume there's a twist with colors but wo any directions,, most people are gonna get confused..what do you do with red and orange. I'm not dumb but everything I tried failed. Maybe developer will add some tutorial..its just stupid not to.its prob a lot better if you know what you're supposed to do. I always check the faotd with Google Play, which I realize amazon blocks for you kindle users but on GP (like so many faotd) only has 10 downloads.  Ouch.  Dont think putting instructions to an puzzle app makes it no fun...You need to know how to play a game - that doesnt ruin the experience or make it too easy...Pretty much every app Ive ever downloaded at least has instructions or a tutorial.  Stupid move by developer.  He's getting unnecessary negative reviews - so no wonder his Google downloads are so low - Bad word of mouth.  Im no developer but Id think thats the opposite of your goals, esp for an FAOTD which is designed to help promote your app, increase your downloads, get you good reviews and word of mouth.  Oh well, his loss not mine.  Cant recommend it.  I dont have the time to waste
B008PALH0E|5.0|In spite of the fact that over a thousand performers are employed here, this is actually a remarkably 'musical' account of Mahler's colossal 8th symphony. The sound quality captured here is equally remarkable for such a challenging, one-off performance. The enlarged choral forces and augmented string section (strings were combined from both orchestras) shift balances away from the brass, woodwinds and vocal soloists, and transfer greater emphasis - logically enough - on to the choral passages. There is, in fact, historical precedence for doing this and I'll elaborate on that point further down.<br /><br />A previous reviewer suggested that Dudamel should have striven for a more detailed and clearer performance. But we already have two DVD's of Mahler 8 that do just that: Bernstein/V.P.O./DG (combined with an equally fine Mahler 7) and, more sharply focused yet, Chailly/Gewandhaus Orch./Accentus from the 2011 Leipzig Mahlerfest. That's not to mention a whole slough of very fine and very detailed CD recordings of the work. Just going by Deutsche Grammophon alone, the Boulez M8 is exceedingly clear and detailed (as one would expect). So then, if we lose some detail and clarity with the greater numbers, what do we gain in return?<br /><br />For starters, the children's chorus is much, much stronger than what we usually hear. For example, \\"Jene Rosen, aus den Haenden\\" (track 16), as well as \\"Er uberwaechst uns schon\\" (track 23) - a passage that is nearly always embarrassingly 'too wimpy' sounding. These two passages are truly improved by the greater numbers. The very start of \\"Alles vergaengliche\\" (the final track) is a bit louder than what we're generally used to hearing, but that first entrance is also far better supported from the low voices - baritones and bass/baritones in particular. The softer choral parts of the \\"Blicket auf\\" passage (track 25) are firmer and easier to hear as well. Best of all, when we get to \\"hinan\\" - the last word sung in the entire symphony -that last syllable floats right over the offstage brass, instead of the other way around. Think of all the recordings you've heard where \\"hinan\\" just disappears beneath the offstage trumpets and trombones (as well as the fortissimo smash on the tam-tam). These may seem like small and petty points, but I believe they add to a more involving Mahler 8 experience. They do for me, anyway. Also, do we really need to hear every bloody detail from the brass during the big double fugue in Part I? Here, in Caracas, the dovetailing entrances of the various sections of Choir I and Choir II are firmer and easier to delineate. Shouldn't we be listening to the choral forces during the fugue instead of the brass? Now we'll jump back to Munich in September of 1910, the premiere of Mahler's 8th symphony.<br /><br />The organizing of the performers, and the subsequent logistics in getting them to and housed in Munich, fell upon a professional impresario: Emil Gutmann. In his many correspondences with Gutmann, Mahler began to worry that his 8th was turning into a runaway train - a \\"Barnum & Bailey act\\". He was rightfully worried that such large numbers would mean that numerous people wouldn't have been rehearsed enough. In all, Gutmann rounded up slightly over 1,000 performers, but it's now believed the actual number was slightly less than a thousand (thus, Dudamel may actually hold the record). Regardless, the premiere in Munich turned out to be the high-water mark of Mahler's entire career. Applause went on for nearly a half-hour and the children stormed around Mahler himself, wanting to hug and 'high-five' the great master. Given a time machine, this would absolutely be the first place I would go to. For on that day in Munich, even Mahler didn't worry about the clarity of each and every, bloop and bleep from the woodwinds and brass. The overwhelming, cumulative effect carried the day. And so it does in Caracas as well.<br /><br />Of course, all of this wouldn't mean much if you hada poor line-up of vocal soloists. But on that point, let's all agree that pretty much every cast for the Mahler 8th is something of a mixed bag. The good news with Dudamel's cast is that the two most important roles are sung by vocalists who are quite good: tenor Burkhard Fritz and soprano Julianna Di Giacomo. Fritz does a fine job on his two difficult solos in Part II: \\"Hochste Herrscherin der Welt\\" (track 19) and \\"Blicket auf, alle reuig zarten\\" (track 25). While maybe not the most beautiful sounding soprano ever to have come along, Di Giacomo does a superb job of belting out her big solo towards the end of Part II (track 23), with Goethe's promise of a newer, brighter day (located just before Kierra Duffy sings her brief offstage solo in her shimmery, slinky gown - the 'eternal feminine' incarnate).<br /><br />For all the hype around Dudamel, he conducts the 8th with a strong combination of focus and restraint. In fact, he displays far more restraint with his gestures than either Chailly or Bernstein (particularly Bernstein, of course). Yet, he's always clear. He's also never looking down at his score - a big plus in my book. My only complaint is a very minor one. For my taste, Dudamel could have gone slightly slower at the very end, where the offstage trumpets make their dramatic leap of a ninth (two times). Also, the final chord could have been held just a couple of seconds longer. But these are minor grumblings for sure. By and large, he does a remarkable job for tackling the 8th so early in his career. For me, this is a huge improvement over his Mahler 1 with the Los Angeles Phil., also captured on a DG dvd.<br /><br />In the end, I wouldn't want to part with any of my three DVD's of Mahler 8: Bernstein, Chailly or Dudamel. Perhaps the best compromise of the three is the Chailly, but his tenor isn't quite as good as Bernstein's Kenneth Riegel, or Dudamel's Burckhard Fritz. Bernstein's is an electric performance, but both Chailly and Dudamel have the advantage in sound and picture quality. But given the improved support for the choral forces employed, if you were to put a gun to my head, I would choose to hang on to the new Dudamel. It's THAT moving for me.
0385344333|2.0|I am going to add my voice to those who are very disappointed with this book.  I LOVE the Reacher character and series, waited impatiently for this release, pre-ordered.  I certainly won't pre-order next time.  What a waste of time and money.

B009GEELDS|5.0|My husband and I NEVER miss \\"Castle\\".  It is the ONLY show we both enjoy equally.  And this fifth season opener was incredibly satisfying, not just in its own merits but also in how it advances the characters forward.<br /><br />For four years we watched as the charming and bright but immature Rick Castle fell deeply and truly in love for the very first time in his life.  And we also watched a dynamic and attractive but seriously wounded Kate Beckett slowly begin to painstakingly crawl out of her shell and learn to trust.<br /><br />That the writers have done this with humor and wit, and adventure and mystery, and adorable fun and genuine tenderness - not to mention with more than a little bit of human wisdom - has been the most enjoyable and heartwarming journey that either of us can ever remember with ANY two fictional characters.<br /><br />And \\"After The Storm\\" is a perfect set piece in a perfect story line in the perfectly imperfect world that has enchanted us in this beloved myth.  FIVE STARS!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|These people live in a silo underground and literally like ant colonies. Each doing their bit to keep the cogs moving. Sheriff Holston is the butterfly in this whole series of five deeply engrossing, thought provoking and marvellous works of fiction that reads like a butterfly effect unravelling in front of the reader.<br />The story is rather somber and yet keeps the reader engrossed all the same. One realizes that the reader has become a part of the silo. Hope is the only last link that keeps the humans of the silo sane and us readers keep turning page after page of lovingly crafted characters with so much humanity and innocence, with both hoping for their redemption..<br />After reading this series, I could only hear John Lennon playing \\"imagine\\" and m.j playing \\"heal the world\\" in my mind...<br />Thank you Mr.Hugh Howey for writing this.
0062119044|1.0|According to my Kindle I'm only 29% through this book, but it's caused such an extreme reaction in me that I had to start my review early.<br /><br />So far the book can be summed up as follows: Eva hates Kevin (and motherhood), Kevin hates everthing.<br /><br />And I hate this book.<br /><br />It received so much attention when it was released because it tackled the very difficult issue of high school shootings, and it's been on my TBR list for years. I was under the impression it would at least attempt to provide some insight into how and why young people can go off the rails so badly that they kill their classmates in cold blood, but it does absolutely nothing of the sort. Kevin is portrayed as unrelentingly evil literally from the moment he emerges from the womb and refuses to suckle. When he is a few weeks old he screams the house down every day until his father comes home, and then he shuts up, because apparently even at this age he is a manipulative little cretin who is smart enough to drive a wedge between his parents. He never smiles or laughs like a normal baby but gives his mother the evil eye and kicks away his toys when she attempts to play with him.<br /><br />At first I thought Shriver was showing that Eva's ambivalence (or downright loathing) towards motherhoood is affecting her child, but when the saintly nanny, Siobhan also finds Kevin unbearable and has to leave, it is clear that the reader is meant to see Kevin as just plain wicked. He is so conniving that he actually hides the fact that he can speak from his parents for years and then starts spouting full sentences out of the blue one day. I'm by no means an expert on children, but don't they need to develop their vocal cords through \\"babytalk\\", starting with sounds that then turn into words? Kevin must have been practicing all this alone in his room at night, evil little genius that he is. The portrayal of Kevin is not realistic in any sense and I feel very cheated that this novel was promotedas serious fiction when this gross caricature belongs in a schlocky horror novel.<br /><br />If Eva is meant to be an unrealiable narrator, and the purpose is to show that Kevin becomes a monster because that's how she sees him, it fails badly because she is such a one-dimensional character. She is selfish, shallow, self-pitying and spineless. Despite what her son has done, most of her pity is reserved for herself and she laments constantly over the ways his actions have affected her life. She is very jealous of her husband's attention to Kevin from birth, and she is also too gutless to stand up to him and tell him that her career as CEO of her own company is more important than his location-scouting freelance job. She has no good memories at all of Kevin's babyhood or any feelings of affection towards him at all, ever. It horrifies me that some critics have claimed that this is a \\"feminist\\" book because it explores the lack of maternal instinct in some women. It is far too unsubtle and heavy-handed for this. It is also not an exploration of the nature vs nurture debate, as it has been promoted by some.<br /><br />The terrifying thing about the Columbine massacre and the many others that this book supposedly draws on, is that the teenagers who committed them were normal children who were perfectly cute babies and did not behave unusually or draw attention to themselves until it was too late. This book does absolutely nothing to explore the social and psychological forces that can lead a young person to lose touch with reality so completely that mass murder is a solution to their problems. To even suggest that it can in any way shed a light on these atrocities is a travesty in my opinion.<br /><br />The book is set during the 2000 election debacle in the US when Bush came to power in very suspicious circumstances. I really can't see what the point of this is, except it gives Eva and opportunity to take swipes at those who care about the demise of democracy in their country. These problems are so irrelevant compared to her own.<br /><br />The other thing that really bugs me about the book is the technique of using letters and reproducing entire conversations in them. It is just so false, like everything else about the novel. I've never said this about a book before but I'd give this zero if I could, I find it that offensive. Maybe my opinion will change as I continue reading, and I seriously hope it does because I paid good money for this book, but I'm not holding my breath. I've read one other book of Shriver's (Game Control) which I also found very unsatisfying and morally dubious, and I believe this one will be the same.<br /><br />Update: Ok, I've finished reading this book in record time, mainly because I just wanted to get it over with, and I was also interested to see if it got any better. I've changed my opinion slightly in that I think it's worth 1 star now, rather than zero. The reasons being that the writing is actually very good and although it doesn't deal with the issues it raises in anywhere near a satisfactory way, it does provoke debate, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />The problems I referred to above still remain though, and became more apparent with the introduction of Celia. In contrast to Kevin who has dark hair, is very smart and downright evil, Celia is blonde, dumb and saintly. I'm surprised she also didn't have a craving for sugar in opposition to Kevin's addiction to salt. She was also an extremely one-dimensional character, with no other purpose than to act as a foil for Kevin.<br /><br />I agree with many other reviewers who have said that it beggars belief that a wealthy middle-class couple wouldn't seek help for a child like Kevin (or that Eva wouldn't get help on her own if her husband didn't agree. She did trick him into having another baby after all so going behind his back was not out of character for her), or that Eva would be so utterly pathetic that she would continue to live in the family home with a child she believed was responsible for destroying her daughter'seye and scarring her face for life. The whole eyeball thing at the end was creepy beyond belief.<br /><br />Ironically the only character I liked in the entire book was Kevin when he called his mother on her hypocrisy. These were the only scenes that actually rang true. Kevin's defence of his mother when he was being interviewed on televsion at the end was so false it was laughable, and her claim that she felt pride for him as he blathered on about how the world needed people like him because he provided something for all the passive morons to watch, was truly sickening.When she tells him that he spoke well on television while spewing out this garbage, it was kind of the equivalent of saying: \\"Shame about all those people you shot down in cold blood, but nice marksmanship, honey.\\" This section really showcased the moral vacuum at the heart of this story.<br /><br />Kevin's transformation as he approached 18 was also ridiculous, as was his claim that he didn't really know why he'd murdered 13 people after all. Shriver's final message seems to be that we can never really know why people behave the way they do, and there are no answers. This is exactly the same line trotted out in the media when another mass murder takes place. It's the individual, not the larger society that is toxic. The book makes some references to gun control, but then Kevin committs his murders with a bow and arrow, undermining this argument to an extent. She also rants about how American teenagers have become so weak and pathetic that they use any excuse to go on a shooting spree instead of \\"sucking it up.\\"<br /><br />The theme running through this book is that the vast majority of people in the US are fat, lazy and stupid. This is a view shared by Kevin and Eva, and the reason she feels proud of him at the end.(\\"Since I myself had craved a turn of the page, is it really such a stretch to say of KK that we need him?\\")No reference is ever made to the rise of American militarism overseas which coincides with the epidemic of shootings at home. A violent, murderous society begets violent, murderous individuals, and those who are most vulnerable and impressionable (like teenagers) will snap first. Bullying is not a minor problem but a soul-destroying experience for those who are the victims of it, and one that begets extreme levels of supressed rage that are very dangerous in a society that glorifies violence and provides easy access to high-powered firearms.<br /><br />As for the whole political context of the story, Eva's conclusion about the US election debacle of 2000 is that in the end \\"there are only people and what happens to them. Even that fracas in Florida - to me it was about a man who wanted to be president since he was a little boy. Who got so close that he could taste it. About a person and his sadness to turn back the clock, to count again and again until the news is good at last - about his poignant denial.\\"<br /><br />WTF???? What about the supreme court decision to halt the counting of votes in Florida which would have shown that Gore actually WON the election? Is that not important? For someone who rants about passive, stupid Americans, Eva's final conclusions that nothing can be done about mass murderers who don't understand their own motives, or political crimes against democracy are the ultimate endorsement of passive acceptance.<br /><br />I'm willing to consider the possibility that I've totally misinterpreted this book and that the author does not actually believe the conclusions she's reached. It's possible that Eva feels pride and love for Kevin at the end because inside she is exactly the same as him, and she secretly admires what he's done. Maybe Shriver is showing that her views and prejudices created the monster that is Kevin, and that he is her mirror-image. Maybe on some level she realizes this and that's why she continues to stand by him. If this isthe case it's not done nearly well enough to be coherent. Sadly, I think Eva is meant to be seen as wise and compassionate, and Kevin's gesture of returning his sister's glass eye is meant to be a tender moment between them. *shudder*<br /><br />I stand by my original assessment that this book does nothing at all to shed light on Columbine and other massacres. It is too confused and unbelievable. By referring constantly to real events and failing to address them seriously it is exploitative in the extreme, and in my view this is unforgivable.

B005HSG3VK|3.0|The cover material is nice and I agree with the reviews that the felt on the inside does, in fact, come in contact with the screen and acts like a screen wipe. However, the suggestion that the cover bends to act as a stand for the kindle is wrong.  It does not work.  I like to read in bed and the \\"stand\\" is not secure enough to stay put.  I just do not use it anymore and I really wanted that aspect of the cover to work.
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|To start with none of the publicity for this title seemed to mention that it is a young adult novel, there's nothing wrong with that but why the secrecy. As is often the case with young adult fiction the characters are not complex and the situations they face are not that challenging. There are few if any new ideas here, only simplified versions of concepts done better elsewhere. Here's the thing though , the way those ideas appear here is the way they'll be in the movie because Ready Player One is not so much a novel as a movie treatment with dialogue . Publication as a book was clearly just a step on the way. I imagine it'll be a very successful movie - the eighties culture references that bludgeon the reader will appeal to an audience that remembers the period almost as much as to the one that is currently enjoying it in retro-form.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I rented the movie on Amazon Prime and I couldn't stop watching it. This movie has excellent drama without the drama overstaying its welcome. That is until you leave the drama and the action and arrive at the romance... which is incredibly awkward the whole way through. But I believe that was the intention. All in all, the bonus features do take this purchase even further with things that supplement the film as well as take you behind the scenes. The best part of this particular Hunger Games is it rewards you for ordering it online because you can watch it as soon as you'd like. No waste of gas, no waiting for it in the mail, no overpriced rental. Its right there, lickety split. This was my first DVD purchase on Amazon and it won't be my last.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I purchased this book because it had a lot of good reviews, but I was disappointed. While it was a fast and relatively entertaining read for the first half, it became ludicrous and totally unbelievable. Although the author may have intended for us to loathe the characters it simply felt contrived and annoying. Maybe it is just me, but it was difficult to figure out if it was intentionally hyperbolic to be cynical or if it was supposed to be thrilling or shocking. If you want a light, un-thought provoking read, it's adequate.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Very enjoyable funny and romantic movie!  Witty dialogue and happy ending!  Ashton and Portman were believable and charming.  Interesting supporting characters.
B0085MNZ66|2.0|This would be a good little time killing game, but the sensitivity ruins it. It doesn't matter if I move my finger slow or fast across the screen - often times the color trail just stops. Many times I figured the answer right away, but it took multiple attempts to have it register correctly. On the more difficult puzzles it becomes frustrating as the paths can be longer.

I was taught one way to cast on by the lady who taught me how to knit and that's all I've been using, but I've noticed that the way she taught me to cast on for socks isn't necessarily the best method for making a sweater, for instance.<br /><br />I've not had the time to do a lot of research into what's the best cast-on for various items, and I don't foresee my having that kind of time in the near future, so I really appreciate that this book tells you which cast-on method works best for which projects (with good instructions supplemented by nice, clear photos). I can quickly reference what I need without plowing through a treatise on the topic (which I would love to do...but not in the next few years).<br /><br />Though packed with information, the small size of the book makes it easy to tote around if you're an on-the-go knitter. I've not tried the various bind-offs yet, though I assume they're as good as the cast-ons. Based on what I've used so far, I highly recommend this handy little reference guide.

0307949486|5.0|I thought this book was enthralling.  I got caught up in the characters' lives and was very satisfied with the mystery.  A good read.
B0085MNZ66|3.0|it's a puzzle game, and it isn't quite like any of the others I've tried, but that's not necessarily a good thing. The difference between this and other similar puzzles is that you can (and must) cross colors. The problem is that there really aren't any other rules so there are tons of possible solutions. If there were more rules, it would be a nice logic puzzle, but with so many solutions and pass/fail scoring there's no reason to not resort to trial and error. That makes it get old fast.
0439023521|5.0|It's obvious why everybody likes these books so much, the characters are beautifully described and very human, and they're put through an incredible ordeal.  It's about character in more ways than one - what would you do to save your family, your best friend?
0002247402|3.0|Well... like many I finished this book very frustrated, after, like some have already said... stories drag and drag endlessly with no climax in any of them.  The abuse of anticlimax began to drive me nuts, I felt like reading Ann Rice's Queen Of The Damned all over again.  Still, I always enjoy his style, as all his books, you can find pretty pearls of writing worth of quoting here and there.  My first impression after finishing this book was that, with the imminent broadcast of HBO's GOT miniseries, the publishing house put pressure on Martin to wrap whatever he had, try to get something that would work as an end, and hand it over for it's quick publishing, and that is what happened.  I read he at least took out 4 already written chapters to save for The Winds Of Winter.  So this book should be seen as a bridge, where action just was build up to reach it's climax... only that... we'll probably will have to wait another 6 years!  Let us hope not!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is one of those \\"wake up\\" books. To read what bravery, courage, honor and duty that these guys have and what they go through for us in the US is astounding. To think of what we pay them for this kind of work versus what we pay the representatives of our country is sickening. They defend us while our representatives screw us. Our government sends these guys on such a mission as this and then uses it as propaganda for their own campaigns while potentially compromising the identity and security of our Seals is unbelievable. Mark Owen, Seal Team Six, all Seals as well as all the other men and women in our Armed Forces are what make me proud to be called an American. Thank God for them and the ones who gave their lives and their families for our Freedom.

Of utmost help is the inclusion of the picture and location for the tool symbols throughout the exercises.  A review at the end of each chapter with questions and answers immediately below is helpful as well.

0452273331|5.0|Extraordinary Talent, Unique and Powerful Creative Writing<br /><br />The book being reviewed is entitled, \\"The Fountainhead\\", and its author is  Ayn Rand. You could say that I am late to the party in finally reading this book. The author was born in 1905 and died in 1982, which shows that she was from my parent's generation. Moreover, the book was written in 1943 and so it has taken me a long time to get to it. I could use the excuse that I was only six years old when this book was first published, yet I have had decades to read it before now. Her other very popular book, \\" Atlas Shrugged\\", was one that I read in my early 20s and it had a memorable effect on me. It made me think about rugged individualism and a gifted elite, who make the major contributions to society.<br /><br />As I write this review, the nation's attention is focused on the presidential contest between incumbent president Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney. However, it is their running mates that finally tipped me over in favor of buying the book. Joe Biden is the current vice president. And not too long ago, Congressman Paul Ryan was selected to be the Republican vice presidential candidate. One of the stories told about him, is that Paul Ryan was so strongly influenced by Ayn Rand's elitist philosophy that he bought copies of her books, distributed them to his staff, and made them compulsory reading. When I learned this about Congressman Ryan, my curiosity was so piqued, that  I took the plunge and bought the Fountainhead and began reading it. Many regard her philosophy as simplistic and extreme. I approached the book expecting to be somewhat disappointed. Within a few pages, she had won me over not to her philosophy, but to her masterful command of creative writing. I commented to those around me, \\"Wow! This author can really write.\\"<br /><br />The Fountainhead is a very long book and has a very complex composition to it. If you have not read it and would like to read it, do not let the great length of the book deter you. Rand has a writing style unique only to her. She can write beautiful descriptive prose when she has a mind to, but she can also write in a suspenseful style that makes you continue turning the pages. She has created both noble and despicable characters to play in her novel. The story of the novel will keep you spellbound on its own, but it is obvious that she is the grand puppeteer pulling the strings of these characters in an effort to persuade you to her moralistic points of view.<br /><br />Howard Roark is the hero of this novel and his integrity is the ideal that Rand wants the reader to value. Howard is an architect, who is unwilling to compromise his creative genius in order to survive in a world that no longer values great talent. Peter Keating is also an architect, but he embodies the opposite traits that Roark lives by. Keating has no originality, no creativity, and will do anything to win approval from the people around him. Dominique is the daughter of a famous architect and Rand has created her to be the ideal mate for Howard, but throws many frustrations in their path before they finally they can openly be with one another on the terms they both believe in. Ellsworth Toohey is a character that Rand created to epitomize that which she hates in society. He is a grand manipulator of people and he does not have their better interests in mind when he manipulates them. There are many other characters in the novel and each of them has been designed to help sell you on Rand's moralistic philosophy. As the author weaves her plot, these characters often behave very differently from the people that  most of us have known. Because of this, the plot is unpredictable and that is a good thing because you just never know what is going to happen next.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Fountainhead is a great achievement in the world of creative writing. As you read the book, you realize that the author is in control and you the reader arebeing swept along wherever she wants to take you. It is amazing that such a complex plot could be conceived and so skillfully developed as a novel. On the other hand, Rand's morality is either black or white and there is no gray zone allowed by her. We all know that life is not like that and at times we feel like we are being pulled in many directions, by our employer, by our spouse, by our children, by our friends, and by what we personally would like to be doing with our time. Most of us do the best that we can and compromise is necessary to fulfill our obligations and goals. Being reasonable is not an admirable quality in Ayn Rand's world. If we look into the author's personal life, and consider that Russian communism and Nazi socialism were two growing malignant ideas in her time, her extremism is better understood. Her father's business in Russia was confiscated by the Communists. Capitalism remained the only fertile ground for her heroes.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I did not mention Ayn Rand's atheism and its influence in her novels. Although she does not specifically criticize religions, it is obvious that she has low regard for charity and self sacrifice, which are mainstays of Christianity. It is obvious in her writing that she has disdain for such concepts. Moreover, her favorite characters in her novels freely have sexual unions with no shame or embarrassment. Her heroes are entitled to do whatever they wish to do because they are the geniuses upon which society always advances.<br /><br />The Fountainhead is a very special book. It is rich in the questions and values that are important to us all. It would be an ideal book for a literature class to discuss. It is an intellectual book and should be required reading for people living in a world of ideas. It is a model for budding novelists to study because it has been done so skillfully and artistically. If this is the kind of book that attracts you, I highly recommend the Fountainhead to you.<br /><br />Ralph Hermansen, September 28, 2012being swept along wherever she wants to take you.

B004FRX0MY|2.0|I basically just use this app for shopping or downloading. The irritating issue with this app is that you cannot set the default download location. As a result, if you have limited internal storage, storage space for your music becomes an issue. It would be much easier to store the music on an external SD card with more space. There are many users complaining about this issue for over a year but nothing has been done. This can't be that complicated.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this app is amassing recommend for all ages.  :) I think if you get it you will be very happy
0689853637|5.0|Very nice book with amazing pop-ups!  The last page in each of Robert Sabuda's books is really spectacular.  You won't be disappointed if you purchase this book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great! I had a ton of fun and so did my son we play it for hours thanks your for making it fun
B008MAI0WK|5.0|I liked this book. It spends a good deal of time in getting up and running with the Pi. It keeps the jargon to a minimum, yet ends up dealing with reasonably advanced subjects like programming the Pi for games using both Python and Scratch, and using the GPIO pins. There's even a very useful section on how to solder. There's a ton of links to further information and it is liberally sprinkled with a bit of humour. It would definitely give me confidence to buy any further books by either of the two authors - one of whom was the inventor of the Pi.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I rented this and was surprised how good it was after seeing some bad reviews and stories about box office disappointment. The story makes more sense than the Transformer movies and the action sequences are easier to follow. Except for one short sequence it has nothing to do with the board game. This one I will buy when the price drops.
B0063IH60K|3.0|There are too many pop up ads. Even though its free. The commercials and ads are a little over-kill. Cut back on those and it would be a lot better.

0307383415|3.0|When Barrack Obama was elected President of the United States it was my opinion that he was the least qualified person to hold the office in my lifetime - which covers 12 previous Presidents. Nothing during his first term caused me to change that opinion. It was also my opinion that he was a doctrinaire narcissist who put his own welfare ahead of his country. Reading this book, and some of his subsequent actions, have caused me to alter that opinion. This is an unexpectedly candid memoir in which the author does not toot his own horn (as \\"The President\\" does in virtually every speech) and reveals his weaknesses as well as his strengths. Nor does he eulogize his African ancestors to the detriment of his white forebears but presents a reasonably balanced view of their relative strengths and weaknesses, compassion and selfishness, vanity and modesty.<br /><br />It is also well written - if a little wordy - and quite moving.<br /><br />Obama bashers claim he mixed a good deal of fiction into his \\"memoir\\" and that's not hard to believe. But fact is stranger than fiction. The fact that author of this memoir would become President of the United States, a few short years after writing it, boggles the mind. It was obviously Barrack Obama's destiny to become the first black President. Just as it was Adolph Hitler's destiny to plunge mankind into into a world war, and Abraham Lincoln's destiny to be assasinated at the moment of his greatest triumph.<br /><br />The man who thanked his supporters after winning his second term in the White House did not resemble the cocky college boy who was elected four years previously so much as the humble, thoughtful and compassionate author of this memoir.<br /><br />And his handling of the Israel crisis was a far cry from his contemptuous treatment of Prime Minister Netanyahu a few years ago.<br /><br />Let's hope, chastened by his first term, Barrack Obama is now qualified to be President of the United States - if he isn't impeached when the Benghazi fiasco is fully uncovered.<br /><br />Jan 21, 2013: My assessment of the \\"new\\" Barrack Obama was misguided. If anything, he is more arrogant and divisive now that he doesn't have to worry about re-election and just as naive in foreign affairs. Barrack Obama is not only one of the least qualified Presidents in U.S. history but, in IMHO, one of the most dangerous.he Benghazi fiasco is fully uncovered.<br /><br />Jan 21, 2013: My assessment of the \\"new\\" Barrack Obama was misguided.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I really like the user interface of this app.  It's very easy to move from one view to another and navigate through your existing nitebooks and notes.  My only complaint is the lack of support for tables within notes.  If the support exists, I can't find it, which is essentially the same thing as it not being supported at all.

B008I3QZKU|5.0|I don't really understand all the hate for Battle Born!  It took me a few listenings to really enjoy it, but I think it's a great step for the Killers.  There's still the breathtaking vocals of Brandon Flowers that will amaze you, the synth is still very much present, and the songs are catchy.  The gem in Battle Born is definitely Here With Me, I've had the chorus stuck in my head for days, \\"Don't want your picture, on my cell phone...\\" and it makes me want to listen to their new music over and over.<br /><br />You can tell that they are evolving as a band, as far as their sound goes.  This is very close to Day & Age than their 1st two studio albums, but that's a great sign to see a band being able to evolve as musicians.  The Beatles (no, I'm not saying they're like the Beatles, just comparing the Killers to how the Beatles progressed) grew in their sound as they went on in the years, and that's a GOOD thing.  If they still made songs in 1968 that sounded like Please Please Me or With the Beatles, they would have been a very boring band that couldn't adjust with the times.  No, Battle Born doesn't have Hot Fuss-sounding rock songs, which I think many people are wanting, but why would you want a repeat of that?  Hot Fuss has its place, as does Battle Born.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good album.  I believe Battle Born will be more appreciated as time goes, and as a step in the right direction for the Killers as a band that proves their longevity.
B00005LIXT|5.0|Amazing album, this two amazing artist are the bigger in the music, the dts sound are perfect, the guitar sound are fantastic, this a terrific dvd audio album, go ahead without any doubt!!!!

160774273X|5.0|The first thing that enticed me to even look at this book, was a picture of a beautifully baked artisan bread the crunch of a crust of which you could almost hear crackle. I have a lot of cookbooks, but none of them are about baking bread in particular, so I was very excited to finally get a book about bread alone.<br />Coming home I started reading through the authors story of how his bakery shop came to be. I learnt that he's not only a successful bakery owner, but that this bakery is also located here in Portland.<br />In the beginning of the book, the author talks about the basics and essentials of the bread making art. He breaks down the theory behind the chemistry. It talks about the importance of each step that's involved in the art. I like the way he explains everything as it is easy to understand. I have not tried any recipes from this book yet, but going through the recipes I can already tell that this is going to be a great resource for recipes. I have made breads and pizzas with similar techniques and proportions described in the book and can not wait to test out some of his.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE this app!!!<br />I have it on my kindle fire and my android phone!! Now I have pinterest anywhere I go!! :)
B002VHI8J0|4.0|Thought this was a fantastic book. I'd only heard of it from the trailer for the upcoming film adaptation and while the film may very well be shit the trailer definitely piqued my interest.<br />The stories are wonderful and gripping and I found it impossible to put down. I'm now looking forward to reading the rest of David mitchells' books.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|The title of the album really says it all. This is an album that's meant to be listened to as an album, and not one track at a time. A lot of the tracks on the album could make great singles, but they're even better when you listen to them in context, and how they flow into or out of adjacent tracks. Sure, it's a different style than their first album, but I think a lot of that is stuff that's migrated over from jamiexx's solo work, and I think it adds depth to the music.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Lots of fun, and strategic similar to Angry Birds. Similarly some levels are tediously easy while others are maddeningly difficult. Well worth the .99¢ to purchase it. At the time of this review it leaves off at the end of the age of pirates. Hopefully the developers will keep going as I would personally love to keep going.
B006O7XOOW|2.0|This toy is not worth the money in my opinion.  The balls are placed on the top of the toy.  When the baby/toddler rolls one particular piece of the toy the toy plays music.  It takes a while for the music to stop.  While the music is playing the balls start to rise.  At the end of the music playing the balls pop up and then the balls fall into one of the three tunnels on the legs.  The balls are supposed to be caught at the bottom of each leg but that rarely happens.  Most times the adult has to go retrieve the balls.  By the time all of the balls are retrieved and placed back on the game, the toddler has found something more fun to play with.  I would not purchase this item unless the price drops to less than twenty dollars.

B007T99ENE|4.0|When you start reading this book it seems like a very light novel, and you may be inclined to put it away if you, like me, are into more heavy, serious or more avantgarde literature. Ian McEwan's book is nothing of the sort. Still, it is very interesting in many ways, so don't give up. There is a love story in the middle, focused on a British young woman who enters MI5 during the cold war. British society and politics, not least the relations with Russia and USA in the 1970ies, are very much present as context for the actions that take place; always filtered through the personal life and eyes of Serena, the main character. But some times during the read I wondered: What is this book? Is it a woman's life and love life seen through a man's eyes (the author), and not too well understood and described? What is Ian McEwan actually trying to do here? But the book is almost a pageturner, you are driven to read further, and when what the book is all about dawns upon you, you are captured. The love story isn't it. The cold war, with spies, MI5's rivalry with MI6 isn't it, the inner life and intrigues of MI5 isn't it. The young woman's life, with her hunger for literature and her love life isn't it. Although all this is important as the key plot. But this book is about writing. About how to write a novel. And it is about love, insecurity, unsafety, politics and about writing about all this. About the relation between life and writing about life; the struggle to capture life in text and by that effort trying to understand more of life, of humans, and of another person as well as yourself. Being able to catch this; a novel about writing a novel, in such an easy but still very clever way is elegantly and brilliantly done by Ian McEwan. The book holds you to the last sentence. Make sure that sentence is the last thing you read, because that is when you start smiling. You know you have been seduced, and you love it.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Fun and addicting, like Angry Birds. Won't work after Android upgraded to Jellybean though. I hope MiniClip fixes it, because I really enjoyed it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a great read and a classic in the genre.  The concepts, characters, and overall story are fully fleshed out and realized.  Seeing how Ender is shaped by the people in his life is the key the the novel.  This is not the easiest of reads for someone at the elementary school level.  It is well targeted at the middle schooler and above.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|This movie had it all: bad acting, bad directing and bad writing.  At some point Hollywood decided that special effects could substitute for these things.  One of these days they will wake up and realize they can't.<br /><br />There are a number of young, attractive women in Hollywood today who can act: Kristen Stewart is not one of them.  She and Robert Pattinson should get married, take the fortunes they made doing the Twilight movies and spare us anymore pathetic efforts at acting.  Casting directors should help them make this decision.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is too good an actress to have squandered her energy on this movie.  Watching this movie was a total waste of time. My advice is to re-watch The Lord of the Rings which this movie tried to emulate to no avail.

B005LAJ16I|1.0|I was so disgusted with the vulgar language and nudity that it ruined for me an otherwise good sounding story.  I watched 2 episodes and determined that I don't want to hear the \\"F\\" word over and over and see nudity that adds nothing to the story.  I was very disappointed, not with the story but, with the vulgarity.  I would love to see this story made with a PG rating so that a family could watch it as it had an interesting storyline and could be a very interesting series.  After watching just 2 episodes I destroyed this series.
0345505387|1.0|Nothing wrong with this book...but it's a graphic novel, which is a glorified comic book.  If I had not previously read the Outlander series, I would not have understood any of it.  I read it in 1/2 hour and was left feeling foolish for spending $ to purchase it.  No more graphic novels for me!

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The white insulation was peeling off of my Kindle USB cable.  I contacted Amazon.  I was plesantly surprised in their quick and helpful response.  I linked to purchase a new cable, which came and is in perfect condition.  It is a brand new cable.  Amazon now only credited my account for the price of the cable, but also reimbursed me the shipping cost along with my order so I didn't pay anything for the replacement cable.  Everything was credited right online and taken care of within a minute of my placing the order.  The cable and the customer service is beyond exceptional.  Amazon you rock!
B0071K5KWU|3.0|To me, this was not as good as \\"7\\", which I thought was more \\"classical\\". Perhaps I should not have expected more of the same. I liked the parts that sounded like movie music, but altogether, this seemed to emphasize rhythm at the expense of melody.
B0018LMZOO|5.0|I bought this CD because of the bonus tracks and they're great.  The original songs, such as \\"New Horizons\\" and \\"For My Lady\\", have been Moodies favorites of mine for many years.  After sampling the songs on Amazon, I was really interested in the instrumentals of \\"You and Me\\" and \\"Lost in a Lost World\\".  They're incredible, as is the full version of \\"Isn't Life Strange\\".  This album highlights the Moodies' progression as musicians and songwriters.  Justin Hayward's signature guitar is amazing, and Mike Pinder's dreamy, etherial work on the Chamberlain keyboard is impressive.  Seventh Sojourn is a nice blend of the Moodies classic orchestral/psychedelic sound and the emerging harder rock of the 1970s. 40 years after it was released, this album holds its own as intelligent, thought provoking rock.  The CD's liner notes describe the Moodies as near burnouts while making this album, not long before they quit recording for several years.  You can't detect that exhaustion in these excellent songs.  The Moodies created a masterpiece before they took a well deserved break.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie ROCKS ! This is the superhero movie people have been waiting for. Got the Blu Ray/Dvd combo and it was worth every penny. I cannot recomend this movie enough.
B0085MNZ66|3.0|Glad I didn't pay for this [Update: but no complaints as a FAOTD download] . Level 6 was a no brainer but the lack of instructions is a real problem. I 'won'  level 11 by routing green through yellow to make.....  Yellow?  Is that a feature or a bug?  And the bonus page bleeps now and then but it's not clear what's going on.<br />Lots of potential and a nice twist on Router-like games but needs work if they're going to expect people to pay for it.<br /><br />[Update] Ok, so there's a slight cue when you go to the bonus page and tap science mode - the sounds change, but there's nothing immediately noticeable. I was apparently in science mode when green went through yellow to make yellow.  Again, clear rules/instructions are needed here.  Someone else posted that science mode may use the rules for combining light, but that shouldn't need to be inferred.
B009IJJ712|4.0|The show has promise; the acting is quite good, as is the directing and locations. The premise is interesting and given Sherlock Holmes morphine problems, believable for an updated version of the character. The shows' writing needs a little work as does the chemistry between Mr. Miller and Ms. Liu but that should come with time. All in all an enjoyable way to spend an hour with your television set

B000HF6XV8|5.0|A very good family movie. A beautiful movie that is good for young and old. Emotionally riveting, with great performances.
1594484805|3.0|I watched the TED clip on youtube first, as suggested by another reviewer, then read the book nevertheless, I felt it discribed well the broader issues around 'routine' versus 'creative' work, and its relations to award and recognition, the reminder on the concept of 'flow' was good, I felt the chapters on 'autonomy' and 'mastery' were the better ones,<br /><br />On the other hand I thought it was a bit stereotype especially in giving examples, saying Cezanne was in persuit of mastery nobody would deny, but the guy had ample time, he died at old age (at that time) of 67 and had painted over and over again the same motives, what about a guy like van Gogh then, who died at age of 37, after a rage of work learning his trade the hard way, still showing his genius nevertheless, I mean: if it takes \\"....spending a few years on the planet....\\" to achieve mastery and to have enough time to contemplate ones existence, then what about the very young people who just start their jobs, or young families who need to make ends meet, or the less fortunate who even struggle for education?<br /><br />As for the chapter 'purpose', I felt otherwise: the author says, soon, for the first time, there will be more people of the age of 65 on the planet than young kids below 5 (with the notion that only the older ones seemingly are intelligent, aware or suited enough to be enlightened by his concepts), so eventually I felt it is a ok book, but in the end the author's suggestion addressed to the 'baby boomer' generation, to say they can take the lead to remodel the concept of 'purpose', to rejunvenate our businesses or remake our world, I feel that is a too big statement to make. To propose a new concept of 'motivation' is one thing, but there is still more to do than that.<br /><br />I felt the section 'toolkit' was shallow and the proposed reading was nothing new.

B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox was one of the first cross platform cloud based apps that I tried. I have an iPad, android phone, pc and laptop. It has made working with and sharing files so easy. I use it all the time, when I was in grad school, I am sure I used it daily. Of course the only downside is you must have Internet access to view your files.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|To much detailed sadist sex... to much detailed sex period... the story could have been told with less of it, and it would have been more tantalizing and sexier.  I got so bored with the repetitiveness, that when it came to another page of sex, I just skipped the page.. and like a soap opera .. I didn't miss anything.  This book wasn't as sex ridiculous as Fifty Shades of Grey.  Still it was barely better than a two star rating.  I think most people who read it .. only read it to see what the hype was all about. It definitely creates some conversation on a subject that a lot of women might not feel comfortable discussing. It might help people get a little more creative in the bedroom.  So for that aspect, I think it could help fire things up for couples looking to wake up their sex lives.  Add a little flavor to your vanilla... so to speak.....lol
B007THA4FI|4.0|J. K. Rowling is an extremely strong writer, and is brilliant at crafting and peopling her tales. First off, you need to set aside Harry Potter and read this book as if it were the only work of hers you've ever read.  If you go into this expecting Hogwarts and all the gang reinvented, you will be disappointed. You'll love or hate this book on the strength of her work, not because it is part of a mega-phenomenon. It is a story of ordinary people, living rather mundane lives. Their politics are mundane and too important to them; their motives are the usual trifling things which motivate petty people. These are not always nice people.  That said, I would recommend this book to those who read literary fiction. This is an adult book, for adult readers.<br /><br />Councilman Barry Fairbane dies young and unexpectedly. This leaves a vacancy on the town council and throws the little town of Pagford in shock.<br /><br />Pagford is, on the surface, a postcard English village, with a cobbled market square and an old abbey, but with a poorer, more modern housing development scarring the outskirts. Beneath the surface, the citizens cope with poverty, drug abuse, child abuse, rape, and mental illness along with all the social illnesses which lie hidden under the mask of civility in most communities. Rowling explores this underbelly with sharp wit, sarcastic humor and sly social commentary.<br /><br />The empty seat left by Barry on the town's council soon becomes the focus of an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations. The characters are well drawn and in true Rowling style, you see them fully before you, warts and all.  They curse, they commit terrible crimes and they are violent toward each other in ways that are both heinous and reprehensible. The youth curse, commit crimes and everything else real youth regrettably do. There are raw, violent scenes  depicted in this tale, and each scene is believable and drew me in.<br /><br />The reason I can only give this book four out of five stars is there are some places where it is a bit slow; but I stuck with it through those few places and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Over all this is a good effort, and shows Rowling's understanding of human nature. HOWEVER - I was unimpressed with the price of the e-book download, and feel that for most people it would be a better investment to wait and buy the book as a paperback when it comes out, because it is most definitely overpriced.give this book four out of five stars is there are some places where it is a bit slow; but I stuck with it through those few places and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Over all this is a good effort, and shows Rowling's understanding of human nature.

0316228532|1.0|I was so looking forward to this book. I've read 100 pages and will not be finishing the book.  I don't like any of the characters so don't care what happens to them.  The story line is very dull and boring. It's very hard to believe that Rowling wrote such a disappointing book.  I found the language and sex to be offensive rather than adding anything positive or entertaining to the story.  Very depressing.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|This series is like a how-to survive manual for when the zombies come, because, let's face it--they're coming.<br />This season has it all, violence, gore, love, passion, starting over, and really cool special effects. It's by far the best zombie stuff I've seen, and I liked it so much I started reading the comic books, oh, sorry, graphic novels, as well. There are some differences between the graphic novels and the series, but they're both equally compelling.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really liked Hugh Howey's books \\"Wool Omnibus Edition: Wool 1-5\\". I bought it for myself as a carrot to inspire me to finish one of my own projects (after hearing about his book on Twitter). I enjoy YA, particularly post-apocalyptic, fiction so it was a genre fit for me. I like Howey's writing style very much and the pacing worked for me (some reviewers thought it was slow). I very much like experiencing the ambiance of a story in real time. It was a different experience to have POV shift for each individual book in the work but I ended up liking that as well. It's a nifty story/series and I can understand why Hollywood bought the film rights. It'll make a terrific movie, and sequels, or TV series. Mr. Howey is a very talented writer and I look forward to following his career. and reading more of his work.
B00846REIS|4.0|Honesty is the best policy, and if I'm honest with myself, this book has totally changed the way I feel about the 50 shades trilogy.<br /><br />The charaters in Bared to You are far more complexed and thought out, and the problems that they both face (though we have only scratched the surface) are more prevlent and deeper. Of course you have your typical rich guy, but it was nice to read about a women who has her own, and even though the money she has is 'shh' money, it's still her's. I love the fact that she doesn't have to depend on Gideon, but she choose to, that to me makes Bared to You, more appealing.<br /><br />All in All it is a great book, and got me over the (unnecessary) hype of 50 shades.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book. The \\"time machine\\" element was not explained, nor did that detract from the story. Interesting twists and turns! Definitely not scary Stephen King, but it will sure make you think about where the world has gone over the last 60 or so years, and whether or not it is for the better!

B000008LNS|3.0|Wow---is this really TOTO?  Yes, but not the TOTO who took us to AFRICA or spouted the virtues of ROSEANNA!<br />But hey---what's wrong with branching out and pulling a few surprises?  KINGDOM OF DESIRE is Toto's expedition into more of a harder rock sound---DEF LEPPARD or QUIET RIOT, maybe?  Fortunately, the immensely talented musicians display their musical wizardry in fine fashion, e.g. the instrumental JAKE TO THE BONE.  And while I appreciate their diversity and skill, KINGDOM is not a favorite of mine.  I guess my tastes lean more to the polished synth/pop rock of TAMBU and TOTO IV.<br />I really like the haunting WINGS OF TIME and THE OTHER SIDE.  ONLY YOU is a great ballad and I guiltily admit a certain fondness for the silly but infectious KICK DOWN THE WALLS.<br />It's sad that we lost Jeff Porcaro after the album's release, but kudos to Steve Lukather's searing vocals.<br />If I had to give up one of my many TOTO CD's, I'd have to say it would be this one.  Certainly not a \\"bad\\" record, just not one of my faves.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I am one of those who was introduced to the \\"Hunger Games Trilogy\\" by the movie. I had not read or even heard of the books until I watched the movie. I had heard such a wide range of opinions about the movie that I was very curious to watch it myself and see what all the discussion was about.<br /><br />I rented the movie and watched it for the first time and had somewhat mixed reactions to it; the problem was it wouldn't let go of my mind and I kept thinking about it and decided to watch it again. After the second viewing I was hooked and decided to buy the three books and find out what was going to happen to Katniss and the others.<br /><br />My curiosity having gotten the better of me I started with book 2, \\"Catching Fire\\" and then followed that up with book 3, \\"Mockingjay\\" and lastly went back and read book 1, \\"The Hunger Games.\\" Having seen the movie first gave me mental pictures of the characters and eliminated the need to create the characters in my mind's eye from the pages of the books.<br /><br />This may have worked to my advantage as after reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" I was favorably impressed with the movies handling of the story. I ordered this Blu-ray edition and have now watched it several times and found it an effective telling of the story of book 1.<br /><br />The major thrust of the books and the movie is bravery and determination in the face of a totalitarian dictatorship that uses the Hunger Games as a control device. This future government of Panem, an area now known as North America, uses military force to terrorize and intimidate the majority of the people who are viewed as essentially slaves to the privileged class who enjoy the favor of the dictator and live in \\"The Capitol.\\"<br /><br />After reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" I was very impressed with the casting for the movie; the actors selected seemed perfect for their roles with subtle nuances of character being brought out in the acting. I'm really glad I saw the movie first.<br /><br />While there are some sadly brutal scenes in the movie those things being represented are all things that have happened in societies both in the past and in the present. The movie does not pull its punches when describing man's inhumanity to man; things we see on the news today and then naively think \\"that can never happen here.\\"<br /><br />It is a warning against allowing any central authority to gain and use power arbitrarily. The old saying \\"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" is still alive and well in the United States in the 21st century. This is a cautionary tale for us and our times and we would be well advised to heed its message!there are some sadly brutal scenes in the movie those things being represented are all things that have happened in societies both in the past and in the present.

B001NTFQRY|4.0|Like any Blade Runner fan, I'd love to one day be able to purchase a soundtrack that has ALL of the music from the film. However, my understanding is that there is a legal dispute between Ridley Scott and Vangelis, so that likely won't ever happen. This collection does give us most of the film score.<br /><br />Disc 1 is essentially the 1994 release, supposedly enhanced (it sounds a bit better, but marginally so). Disc 2 has music from the movie that hasn't been released before. There are some great tracks, such as Tyrell's death. For some reason they're not in the order that they appear in the film, but at least we have them. Disc 3 is a hodgepodge of music by Vangelis. Some of it's soothing, some of its useless. I personally would rather Vangelis have released the first two discs for a lower price rather than tack on this third disc.<br /><br />Sadly, I suspect this is as good as we'll ever get. You owe it to yourself to at least purchase the mp3s for disc 2 separately.

B007CW2FCA|5.0|These early sixties performances found Arrau at a crossroads. He was still a great virtuoso but more inclined to slower, more deliberate performances.  Compare these sonatas to his LVB sonatas and five piano concerti in the EMI Icon series from the mid 1950s. More speed and virtuosity in the earlier set. The sonatas on ICON: #s 7.22, 23, 24, 28, 31, 32.  One can hear the most difference in opus 53 and 57, which outstrip the Philips versions-considerably more electric.  This is true also of the five concerti w/Alceo Galliera c.f the Philips set with<br />Haitink and the RCOA, excepting Arrau's #4 with Haitink (see my review), which at least ties the EMi #4<br /><br />HOWEVER,in the Philips set, there is sufficient speed and elan in #s 1-16 and 24-32.  Incredible clarity and precision, poetry and analytic prowess. All abound in these groups. Try the negelected opus 7 and opus 31/1<br />(my favorite of the opus 31s-in which he joins a titanic group in reclaiming an orphan: Serkin, Annie Fischer,<br />Brendel} .I prefer his 31/1 to his 31/2 and 3. 31/2 is insufficiently stormy and the Waldstein I find too sedate c.f his live You Tube Waldstein* from 1970 which sounds more like his 50s recordings.*** I also heard Arrau play the Emperor in Boston in 1967 even better than he had with Galliera. The differences could not be stereotyped. Of one judgment I remain confident. In the final five sonatas Arrau remained titanic-his Hammerklavier and opus 110  -my favorite of the final three;listen to Arrau's dolente and fugue for example- are pinnacles of metaphysical exploration, not to slight the other three sonatas.<br /> Even with his sometimes imperfect Mozart sonatas in the late 70s and 1980s, he could play flawlessly. His disc with k570, 576, and 540 is peerless even by his standards, with the greatest ever Adagio k 540; ditto his k310 and 330 and the 70s sonata k457 + shorter works (k475, 397, and 511). Still, his great Orfeo Salzburg Mozart recital in 1956 parallels his Icon Beethoven and must be heard to complete the picture. At this new price, this set is a must-but so are the seven sonatas and five concerti on Icon.<br />*** I have not yet heard/seen the remainder of the two Beethoven DVDs recorded in Bonn (1970 and 1977) with seven<br />additional sonatas<br />Peers in complete or partially complete sets:  Serkin, Brendel, Pollini, Backhaus, Annie Fischer, Richter, Gilels, Gelber
1451626657|5.0|Creating comedy during the murderous insanity of World War 2 is nothing short of pure genius. Joseph Heller, author of the fictional masterpiece Catch-22 showed the world a different view of the perils encountered during war, twisting them into a witty page turner. The story's main character, United States Air Force Captain John Yossarian, is a B-25 bombardier stationed on the island of Pianosa, west of Italy in the Mediterranean Sea in the year 1943. Understandably, Yossarian continuously tries to scheme his way out of flying bombing missions, since thousands of people he has not met are trying to kill him. Despite his best efforts, Colonel Cathcart continues to increase the amount of missions the men must fly to satisfy their service requirements and return home. As the title suggests, there is a catch:<br /><br />  There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause in Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.  \\"That's some catch, that Catch-22\\" he observed. (p.46)<br />The above quote is one basic yet confusing catch can be put into simpler terms: a person is considered insane if he willingly flies combat missions, but if he requests to be removed from flying, he is deemed sane and therefore fit to fly. This basic element continually puts Yossarian in danger by the very system he is supposed to be protecting. He is more concerned with his own survival instead of winning the war, calling into question his integrity and patriotism.<br /><br />  Heller follows no traditional structure in his novel, rather relies on free association to tie the book together. While the storyline seems at times to follow no discernible path, it perfectly echoes war is itself. Both are vain, chaotic and irrational. But it is that very structure (or lack thereof) that sets the book apart from anything else ever written. Having this book follow any sort of chronological order normally found in other novels would do Catch-22 (1961) a disservice and detract from its overall greatness. Heller implants key flashbacks and side stories at critical points during Yossarian's journey to save his own hide. The complicated storyline structure requires the reader's careful attention to accurately understand all descriptions and anecdotes. Heller introduces complex characters and themes early on, but waits until further in the text requiring the reader to rely on both recollection and foreshadowing.<br />  The book also uses third person omniscient narration to further develop and complicate the storyline. The reader learns more from each character than they would if the book was only through Yossarian's eyes. These different points of view allow the reader to fully grasp inside jokes and see characters in a complete three dimensional light. Few characters, due to the in depth detail in which they are described, are considered minor character.<br />  Catch-22 (1961) is a classic masterpiece that has withstood the test of time by being in a category all on its own. Pulling out all the stops, it grasps the reader and leaves you yearning for more. The book's influence on American culture culminated on the phrase \\"catch 22\\" becoming popular in the English language for a situation with idiotic circular logic further testifying to Heller's brilliance.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have played Coin Dozed on my son's phone whenever he was visiting and I was so excited when it became available on KF (kinds a sad commentary on my life,  huh?).

Eventually they will increase by just playing the game.
0385344228|3.0|I had to step away from this book for awhile after finishing it because if I reviewed it immediately after, I'd have given it 2 star max; mostly because of the overwhelming 5 star reviews on Goodreads and Amazon. This book was set up like it was the holy grail of legal thrillers. When I finished it I wanted to throw it against the wall...the only thing stopping me was I read it on my kindle and didn't want to break my kindle.<br /><br />I'm going to get a little off topic and bitch about the reviews first. More and more lately it has been very transparent that reviews for books are set up from the beginning. I knew this before but with the amount of book bloggers out there receiving free copy from publishers it has become even worse. We bloggers swear tat our reviews are unbiased (and the majority are - thank you!). But let's be real, if a person continues to write poor reviews about the books publishers send, the publishers will eventually stop sending free copy to them to review. I'm in the industry. I get how it works. It becomes obvious when you click on the reviewers names and backtrack to their other reviews and every book they have ever read is a 4 or 5 star rating. Sorry, I call b*llsh*t on that.<br /><br />I totally appreciate the real and candid reviews I find on Goodreads and Amazon and it's becoming easier to see those shining stars out there. I have a site that I use to share books with my friends and family and I receive offers to review. I pass most of them because I'm simply not interested in the book. Life is too short to spend time reading something that the synopsis doesn't even grab you.<br /><br />Back to the book, I will add one more star to this book and make it a 3. Which by Amazon standard is \\"it was ok\\". It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, it was just \\"ok\\". There is nothing wrong with an \\"ok\\" book. I didn't find it \\"emotionally taut\\". I found it \\"emotionally irritating\\". The whole family needed a cold dose of reality into their lives. I wanted to keep asking the mom and dad \\"Are you alive in your life? Have you any clue what is going on in your own lives...in your own kid?\\" As more details emerged about early childhood, the more irritated I got. Insert some Samuel Jackson here and scream \\"Wake the **** up!\\"<br /><br />Most of this book was predictable. Andy (the father) insinuated a lot continuously throughout the book, so we could see what was coming ahead by his own prompting. What missed for me was emotional connection to the Andy (dad), Laurie (mom), and Jacob (son). I felt nothing for Laurie and absolutely zero for Jacob. Without an emotional connection to the characters...something loveable...I can't feel for their predicament.to keep asking the mom and dad \\"Are you alive in your life?

0545265355|5.0|I remember the hype about the \\"Hunger Games\\" and thinking it was probably some stupid, poorly written series.  Boy, was I wrong.  I started the series after labor day and just finished the third one.  I think the thing I love more than the storyline is that Suzanne Collins knows how to develop her characters.  Every one of them had significance and I absolutely loved the series.  She is quite a talented writer and will be curious to see what her next work of art entails.  I'm sold on her as an author!  Bravo!!
0812993292|2.0|I read most books short- or long-listed for the Man Booker Prize.  I have no idea what this book is doing on that list.  It is a cute book.  It is sentimental. (I.E. The author seems to love her characters more than even God could.)  The protagonist is \\"endearing,\\" and his wife is \\"bitter,\\" and the reversal makes him childishly helpless and her generous.  These conversions happen in fiction, but usually they are caused by plot events.  Here it seems only that the book is ending and the author must tie every plot thread into a tidy bow.  There is no character that feels three-dimensional.  They are walking, talking plot-tools. These are not archetypes (familiar, inspiring characters) but stereotypes (predictable, cliched characters).  While the novel broaches serious themes--the yearning for spirituality in an age when the most sincere desires get hijacked by celebrity culture--this is a saccharine exploration of those themes.  It you want a book that oversimplifies difficult, complex subjects, this is for you.
B00136JPB0|5.0|Just wanted to throw my five stars in for an incredible, iconic (whatever THAT means) CD. I know this isn't helpful but for the fact that it increases the percentage of 5's. No time to wax poetic!
B0057B8PT0|5.0|This is the greatest well rounded album of our time. This album is great from track one to track thirteen. It is too bad that it has taken America so long to catch on to this artist. Olly was a start on X Factor UK and even though he didn't take the title, is sure to be successful. It is a must for his jazzy take on modern pop-rock.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|While the movie couldn't match the scope of the book, and what movie ever does, this adaptation wasn't as bad as some reviewers offer. One of the things that throws some viewers is that this is a third person omniscient take on a novel told in the first person singular.<br />I appreciated the actors--Peeta, Rue and the district rep were perfect, I enjoyed Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, and although Woody Harrelson looked too healthy to be Hamish his acting was spot on. Katniss; the actress who played her was picture perfect, but after reading through all the books twice and watching this over twice, I realize the character of Katniss is not sympathetic, she is self-centered and selfish in the extreme, and is so focused on being a martyr, that she never realizes that a) she's being played for a fool, and b) she was being protected, and c) she is an extremely poor judge of character and intent of those around her.<br />It's her story though, and the movie manages to get the most salient points across.
0307895475|3.0|Great and awesome guide but...<br /><br />Upon opening my package, I noticed that my guide was not protected in any way. This guide is suppose to be newly released, bought \\"new,\\" but instead it came in like a \\"used\\" guide. Guide was not wrapped in plastic like how most new guides are. Also, with the way they shipped it. They just opened the box and threw the book in without any sort of wrapping. So, upon arrival, the book had all sorts of wear all over the edges, indicating it was sliding up and down inside the box. Nothing was holding it in place on the inside. Thus making it look used. Another thing I noticed was the spine of the guide. Why were there cracks and bends? Looks used... Very very disappointed with Amazon's packaging.
1932100660|4.0|This book is beyond informative and will completely change the way you think about eating. It is amazing to learn of the adverse ways in which food changes us. It is thorough and there is a lot of knowledge to be gained however, it is written very much from the standpoint of a medical professional and can be tough to keep track at times. They do a good job of trying to offer metaphors and analogies which helps, but it is still very overwhelming in nature. If you're looking to change you lifestyle with regard to food, this is a great choice. You won't eat the same ever again. I highly recommend the cookbook \\"Forks Over Knives\\" as a diet companion.
1402270275|5.0|Wow. This is a fast-paced, emotionally-intense adventure in a gritty alternative historical London. There are vampires -- which are not my favourite thing, but Blade *sigh* *swoon* is a romantic hero to hold onto. Great story. Nice touch of dialect (Cockney). Sexy.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I know this series has been out for a while, and I've just recently decided to pick it up.  This is the second book for me (going to read them in order), and I must say I'm really enjoying it.  The plot and character development is top notch, with a good dose of suspense to boot.  I highly recommend this book (and the series) to anyone.
B004S699K4|5.0|This is a great movie if you already have the dvd you must upgrade to the blu-ray version it's worth it, plus the beautiful \\"Jodi Lyn O'Keefe\\" is amazing in this movie. I heart her!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great book. I had to start reading the second book immediately. Definitely get the second before you finish this one.
B003W5C0VC|5.0|Great movie! I love the Hannibal movies i wish they would make one more! A must have if you like The Silence Of The Lambs
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book! I have actually read it twice now. To me it was more \\"real\\" life than other books. Travis ...... what can I say besides every girl wants a guy to fight for her.

B008X8QCTO|5.0|Yes, it would have made more sense to charge $1.99 outright, but really?  I read the reviews and was aware of what was to come and got it, anyway.  The game is rather awesome.  Definitely worth more than $2.00 and I am quite happy with my purchase(s).  So much more than I was expecting.  A great game, lots of areas to explore, and enjoyable puzzles.  I have zero complaints and truly do recommend it.  Enjoy it as much as I have.

B007THA4FI|1.0|This book is depressing, rude, flat, and totally a waste of time.  Rowling should go back to what she does best...because it is NOT this book!

B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game! Really excellent. Well worth the money. Of the hidden object games, I would say this is one of the best. I wish there were more in the series.
B0018OFN4U|4.0|This movie is awesome a great combination of fright and laughter. I highly recommmend this film. This is one of the first movies to have comedy and horror it was a great mix.
1843793792|5.0|I first read this novel quite a few years ago (when books on cd were unheard of) and it still stands today as probably my favorite Georgette Heyer book.  It is funny, charming, beautifully written and the title character will still resonate with modern women as a woman of a far different time who very definitely has a mind of her own!  Although their relationship (can we call it that?) is difficult from the very beginning, who can resist the different paths she and Damerel take to find each other at last?<br /><br />Also--if you have to choose the ideal reader to bring this story to absolute joy, who better than Richard Armitage with his beautiful baritone voice that seems to keep all of the characters living and breathing while injecting even more humor into this already comic tale?  Is there nothing this man can't do--superlatively?
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is so addictive!  I love to play it and earn coins. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves adventure
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is the best COIN DOZER AND CARNIVAL GAME YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE ITS THE ONLY GAME THAT IVE PLAYED ON LONGER THAN AN HOUR STRAIGHT
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like this app. its easy to use and super fun.u can pin and read later which is great for when I want to browse like crazy
B002VECM4A|5.0|Precious was a very good movie.  Although it was a very sad story, I still enjoyed it.  I read reviews of the dvd before I made my purchase.  I would give the movie 5 stars.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I played the game for about 5 min before I wanted to delete it. my niece likes it though so I kept it. not really a game for adults...
B008M34CSI|3.0|Movie was decent and fun, but nothing new or groundbreaking.  I enjoyed watching it, but don't really need to own it.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|If you have a good television, you owe it to yourself to get this movie. The visuals are simply stunning. On top of that , there is an excellent soundtrack. An incredible amount of artistry went into this and it really shows. Two thumbs up
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is a great game for when your bored, it is also ag great game Alone. it helps the time fly by but usually it is just fun.... you have coins every 30 sec.
030758836X|3.0|I jumped into reading this novel with such high hopes. I plunked down my 12.99 begrudgingly but I expected a compelling read. I must say that in many aspects Gillian Flynn does deliver, but in many others... Not so much! Definitely ended purposefully but left so many questions unanswered and I think it's because editors want writers now to come up with a three book saga. Maybe they were hoping she would write a sequel. If she does, I'll read it.
B006TJXZ30|2.0|Looking for an email suite for my kindle fire use this is not the one just for Hotmail not like Livemail.....
0525953728|5.0|Great book...<br /><br />I read a lot of books on Seals and this along with Lone Survivor top the list. Read the book in a 2 days. Very well written and just flows. Not sure what all the hype was about the government  getting upset about the release of this book. He does not give out any classified intel at all. Besides it seems in this 24 hour news cycle everyone is leaking a lot more than this guy. He tells the TRUE story of what happened and NOT what the government wants you to think. Kudos for him for setting the record straight. Very interesting read. Next on my list is Service by Marcus Lutrell. I will give my honest review on that after I am done. Buy this book! You will be glad you did!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I can't stop playing this game!!! Very entertaining and fun!!!! Got it for my Kindle!!!  You'll love it!!!!  So start playing....
