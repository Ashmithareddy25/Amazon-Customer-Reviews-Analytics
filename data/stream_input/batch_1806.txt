B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutley love Pintrest!!! I have this app on my iPhone as well as my Kindle Fire.  I have gotten so many different ideas from pintrest from outfits, to make up looks, to hair styles, to home decor ideas.  Wonderful app to always have on the go.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent acting, scenery and storyline.  A must have!  Maggie Smith is amazing in every scene she is in.  The price for all these DVDs is a bargain.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Had heard so much about the book and its contents and it was nothing like I thought it was going to be.  Just an innocent college girl smitten with an experienced guy and he gave her the sex she liked, but in the end she decided she didn't like being spanked and hurt the way he hurt her and she walked away.  She loved him, but he didn't love her in the  same way. Good decision on her part.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This thermal paste works great at allowing your computer to cool more effieciently! I've repasted a lot of computers with this Arctic Silver and meets and exceeds my standards, highly highly recommend it.
B009B4ZEKM|2.0|I've never really thought that Christina Aguilera has ever been able to generate any decent albums, despite being very vocally talented, her albums always seem to come out bloated and filler-laden. Even \\"Stripped\\" was a mess in many ways, despite producing some very outstanding pop music. It certainly doesn't help that she often seems overly confident in her musical output and songwriting either. Her 2010 effort, \\"Bionic\\" failed to garner much interest or critical acclaim, and didn't have any noticeable hits or hints of quality or respectable pop music. \\"Lotus\\" may even be worse, if that's even plausible. It begins with another useless intro, and throughout contains awkward collaborations (\\"Make the World Move\\" and \\"Just a Fool\\"), and not to mention, trite and useless ballads (\\"Sing for Me\\" and \\"Blank Page). The album does have some redeeming qualities, there are quite a few catchy tunes on it, but then you start to realize that many of them are quite generic and run-of-the-mill, and ultimately exhausting (\\"Let There Be Love,\\" \\"Cease Fire,\\" and \\"Around the World\\"). Other gripes I have with this album are the ridiculous and gaudy album cover, and the lack of great deluxe edition bonus tracks; I at least thought that \\"Bionic\\" had fantastic bonus material, \\"Lotus\\" just adds some B-quality dirge tacked on for a charge of a few extra measly dollars. It's not a surprise other popstars have and continue to outperform Aguilera in sales and quality musical output; talent does not necessarily equal great music. Bottom line, this album just isn't all too thrilling or outstanding, there are quite a few earworms throughout, but nothing that really makes you go \\"Wow!\\" or \\"This is timeless material that I'll treasure and that will entertain me for a lifetime.\\" It's not at all shocking that Aguilera is continuing to suffer from low sales, and I seriously doubt she'll be able to dig herself out of this musical rut and lack of success, because her musical content was never all that strong to begin with.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: \\"Army of Me,\\" \\"Red Hot Kinda Love,\\" \\"Your Body,\\" and \\"Circles.\\"trong to begin with.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: \\"Army of Me,\\" \\"Red Hot Kinda Love,\\" \\"Your Body,\\" and \\"Circles.\\"

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I want to say something negative about The Duchess War just to retain some credibility, but I've got nothing to complain about. I loved this book. Robert is a duke very aware of the injustice of his position. His political views are radical, his motivation lies in trying to be the complete opposite of his father.  Robert prides himself on personal control.  He takes careful steps to keep the fall out from his radicalism from falling on others. Minerva is a quiet girl leading a quiet life. She's constructed a small, safe box to live her life in and she is steeling herself to put the lock on the cage. After meeting Robert that small world is no longer enough. Suddenly Minerva craves more than just security, even as she examines if her cage is actually as safe as she thought. As always, Milan creates characters with depth and history. Minerva has solid reasons for wanting a safe world. Stepping outside of it is not consequence free. Robert is reacting to a legacy of shame that isn't his to bear but which he can't put down. I really loved her clever mind and his need to find a cause that redeems him. They were great characters on their own and totally worked as a couple.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I think Lizzy Hale is awesome. she reminds me of Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, and Lita Ford all rolled into one.The band is musically very talented and has a well balanced sound from the first track Love Bites(so do I) till the very last track Heres to Us.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Netflix said I would love this, so I took a chance and purchased it.  Netflix was right on the money.  It was so much better than I ever dreamed it would be.  Great battles.  It almost reminded me of the Lord of the Rings.
B006OT03BM|5.0|really good product. was really happy to get a collectors edition with a signature and awesome packaging. The disc doesn't really play with all Blu ray devices here in New Zealand, but non the less, it is a great buy
B0068MNNOE|5.0|This movie portrays a question that is still debated by experts - who really wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare?  Well worth watching.
B008LD09LS|5.0|hey all you people out there I think you should get this game because it is freaking sweet and also very fun to plau
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this series on the list of books Amazon recommends and was so excited to find a new series! I have been searching for good book for a while and this was perfect! I wish they were a little longer though! I finished the first 5 in two days and now am reading the 6th. Great books, great author! I am a heavy reader, I read a new book roughly every 10-14 days but this book is great for people who don't read a lot and don't have a lot of time to read.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This movie is a masterful reflection of the fears, hopes and dreams of humanity as well as a fitting tribute to those of uncommon imagination. Bravo!
B004NS710C|5.0|You don't see movies like this anymore. Chris Pine is becoming a great actor. Denzel Washington is great as usual. A must see!!
B005MW68RK|5.0|Between Joe's guitars and Beth Hart's voice the sound of this album would be enough to buy it, but the songs are fantastic too.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I read this comic book when it first came out in the 1980's. It was the most amazing Batman story ever. Now to see it in a movie that is justa s good as the book is great. I can't wait until Part 2 comes out in January.
0979019710|5.0|Im almost done with reading The Miracle Morning book and I gotta say its one of the best books I've ever read. Its THE how to book to take your life to the next level. The techniques in this book have been tested by many people and they have proven to work. I have met the author of this book back in 2007 and all these years he has shown his passion to help people and improve our lives. This book is designed to do just that and it truly delivers. I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The greatest super hero team up movie of all time. What more can I say!! It's even better on Blu Ray!!
B009FZHYKU|1.0|I wasted money on this purchase because i couldn't use the viewer. The viewer would not show up on the screen so i could see the video.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|This movie is so entrancing. Our 4 year old loves it and has wathced it over 20 times already or more. I even get caught up in it again and again. The young actor playing Peter has such cute facial expressions. All the children are adorable and the actor who plays Hook is very good in this role. All actors are very good. Just a GREAT family movie!!!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I heard some good and bad. The bad was from adults that said it was so &#34;disney&#34;. Well, that's what it is. I thought it was great. The humor is adult enough that it was fun while my 3 year old sang and danced and was basically (jaw-agape) in wonder at it all. While there was some violence it was not &#34;scary&#34; and the lasting impression was of princesses, arrows and &#34;horsies&#34;!! I will be adding this to my home collection.
B007MDB548|4.0|although the animation is great as always, this story is not my favorite of all the Tinker Bell movies. But young children will enjoy it anyway.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone. Especially teenagers though. You can relate to the main character so much, and this book is just wonderful. At first it may seem boring, but i promise that you have to keep reading.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|...so watch out. I got this for my Kindle because my four year old loves Star Wars. Then I lost my recharge plug and he has been so upset because he cannot play this really fun addictive game. Even adults will love it. My husband even started playing and he is not into video games at all. Great game for little boys who need a time out with their outside play or when traveling long distance. Keeps him happy. Please get here soon replacement electric cord...
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This is a fantastic action movie and even better if you love classic cars. One of Nicolas Cage's best movies and Angelina Jolie is at her smouldering best.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Now I feel I can carry my Kindle with me. I love the color, and the stand. It is well made, and works as it should.
B002BIULQ2|4.0|Light entertainment for the teenage set. Fairly basic plot and light comedy that can be watched by the whole family. Our daughters really enjoyed it.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I gave this product four stars for its ease of use. I am using it to track diabetic notes. I use it on a daily basis.It serves this purpose well.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|From the moment I first read Howl's Moving Castle, it sealed a place for itself in my heart. I own two copies of it in paperback, and when it went on sale on ebook format I snagged up a copy. I love this story--it's a classic journey with humor and wonderful, lovable characters.
1469216051|4.0|The end was a total surprise. Very entertaining book. I would recommend anyone that enjoys the offbeat and read to be entertained and not looking for a deep meaning.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have spent a lot of time blasting through the levels on this game. I can't seem to stop playing it. I ended up buying the 99 cent 5-hint pack after I'd used the 3 that came with it, but I think 99 cents total for this much time spent entertained is well worth it--and it's not required. It's entirely possible to play this game for free, and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes puzzles games.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|What a brilliant movie and an amazing performance by Tom Hardy. If you're thinking about buying this don't hesitate, you'll be glad you did. Highly recommended
B0073LWEXK|4.0|It's fun to play....interesting how you have to go back and forth between the scenes to get things to happen
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm syre mostly everyone knows about this series so I won't go into great detail. Great book, some minor spelling errors that I'd occasionally pick up on but nothing I couldn't get over. Great story line, pick up your copy already!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have watched walking dead since the beginning and it's a tv show that will make you addicted to it...don't want to miss it. I have never seen a tv series this good and the pictures, visual effects, great acting, great cast...it just fits in.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This an excellent show and my favorite of everything available. One shoulod watch from the beginning so you fully understand the plot.
1451626657|5.0|I read this book when I was in high school because it was required reading. I really didn't get the full impact of it then. This book is genius. The sarcasm is the perfect dry type of humor to mix well with WW2.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I don't understand what the point of this game! What's the point of even downloading it? I bought it, then I deleted it!!!
B004GVUPFE|3.0|it's an ok puzzle game - nothing new and innovative and not all that exciting. they do get more difficult over time but it didn't raise the fun factor for me - it was amusing for a short while but won't be sticking around. the move recording system was annoying as each square was considered a move and not the actual move itself -  this downloaded and functioned fine on my kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|was truly unsure how  a second book would hold my interest, but this one really is as great( or better, I have not finished yet) as the first book. If you read the first, hold on for the next!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This is not an issue on the other two Kindles I own!! FIX the news feeds!!!! They do not load past the first 6 feeds. FRUSTRATING!!!!
B00433SVP6|5.0|A very good book. Really gets you hooked on to it. You won't be able to keep the book down.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game its really fun. but it needs another update. I beat every level with 3 stars. So I hope you guys come out with a more challenging update soon.
B0033807C2|5.0|A very good book. Really gets you hooked on to it. You won't be able to keep the book down.
B0076XIS4O|4.0|Really great album. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I'm not sure how &#34;timeless&#34; it is, but it's fantastic for the here and now.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|Really good book. Hooks you into it. You won't be able to put it down. A good buy, by my standards.
B008Y6UND6|5.0|You need to pay attention as it's sometimes hard to follow, but this is a great thriller. Highly recommended for a night under a blanket.

B002RI9S2Y|5.0|A very good book. Really gets you hooked on to it. You won't be able to keep the book down.
B00785P2QC|3.0|fun, but with the same mechanical limitaions as other pay to play games. you always run out of energy, money, or in game currency before a single session is over.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|Purchased this for my 2009 A4. Works perfectly. I hooked a 8GB memory stick with a bunch of MP3's, and it works great.
B005WMADYE|5.0|All but the most mainstream anime don't interest me but I really enjoyed this movie. And I'm not big into cars or racing either.
B007HACDLK|5.0|There is really nothing anyone can add to the greatness of all Vince  Flynn's books. I don't even know if I have a favorite, I love them all.  The Last Man is great.  Looking forward to Reachers next adventure, I think or hope there will be a love interest in it.  There is sort of a hint in this book, he might be ready again.
B00003CXPD|4.0|my sister is a dancer and she loved it. it was a great gift for her she really enjoyed the story line
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|DVD was what was advertised. This is one of my favorite movies, I could watch it again and again! Quick shipping and arrived as expected.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|This was the first believable movie in the e.t. sci fi catagory.  This is one of Matthews first films that I can remember and I still enjoy it
B009NPKTN6|4.0|If you love musicals and 80s rock, you'll love this. The plot line was a touch over the top (as it is in most musicals), but Tom Cruise was genius in this. One of the only movies I like him in.
0785168052|4.0|First I will agree that the art is not the best I have seen.  The coloring though is good and makes the pages visually appealing. The other comments also are correct that the story  is not in order.  The first half of the book is the story as it unfolds until an ending halfway through the book.  The remaining stories showcase fights between the xmen and avengers that occurred before the conclusion of the story.<br />That being said I thought the story was well written and interesting and best of all tied into a storyline from the Xmen of the 80's. For the spiderman fans, the best chapter in the story shows why spiderman is the truest hero in comics.<br />I bought the signed version and would comment that it does mention that it is limited to 500 copies on the dust jacket and has a separate card signed by the authors (not attached to the book) and a card of the same size with the front cover art.  You can decide which edition you want but the story itself has a valuable place in any comic book fans collection.
B008N1V11U|4.0|love this but to much for me to understand.  Kids older would love this. My grands are to young,age inappropriate. I think they will be ready for it maybe in a few years. I didn't want to invest much money in other items that go with the game if they couldn't play it.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|A bit of  suspension of disbelief is required, but this movie is a fun ride! Worth renting and I would watch it again.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is a well-put together drama. Fun to watch. I particularly enjoy the fact that the main character is a strong, smart, conflicted female!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Amazon has captured my audience with groceries, other dry goods, electronics, books, music, and now video and streaming.  Thank you Amazon for bringing me the products I love.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I got this app while I was pregnant to let my baby inside listen to the outside world via babybuds and now that she had been born the soothing sounds help her sleep even without the headphones.
1451695195|4.0|This a is a well thought out book though people looking for a complete understanding might be disappointed. The afterlife is far from what we can understand with the human mind.  The author makes this point throughout the book and does an admirable job of trying to explain his experience.
B008ENA74E|5.0|This book gives the inside story of what we were all afraid of but didn't want to believe...the erosion of a company because of greed and the loss of a moral compass. Hopefully, Wall Street and big business will listen.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|Series is excellent. As others have noted, packaging for storing discs could be better.  Slots for discs are very tight.  I wrap each disc in a tissue before re-inserting in folder to avoid scratching.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I watched season 1 and looked forward to season 2.  I wasn't sure how it would be but they delivered.  I especially liked Adam Levine's guest appearance.  Usually guest appearances don't come off well but his dis.  Jessica Lange continues to sparkle and fascinate and intrigue and repulse and somehow humanize this character.  It was a good 8 episodes.  I look forward to the second half.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Got the movie on time!  The my nieces and nephew love the movie I even got my mom to watch.
B000HL09MG|5.0|Only Stanley Kubrick could make a movie like this one.  It's strange and riveting.  Nudity aside, the &#34;ritual sequence&#34; at the &#34;house,&#34; coupled with Jocelyn Pook's backwards soundtrack, is bizarre to say the least.<br />In a catagory of its own.
B004IFD9HE|4.0|i like this movie because my son like too watch it over and over,again, and its a great family movie....
1419705849|5.0|Well worth the 5$ I paid on black friday for this book! My kids love the series and it has been in circulation in my classroom since the day that I bought it!
B009SQRL4U|4.0|i like this movie bacase it makes my son laugh , and it kind of get away from the old santa comming down the chiminey.....
B0065CCM76|5.0|If you are a Bob Seger fan or know someone who is, this greastest hits collection is the one to get! A good mix of live and studio recordings that will keep your toes tapping.
B006IGZWB2|3.0|its kind of long but the old lady loves it, im not really into drama but the movie seems ok...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Although not quite as good as seasons 1 and 2 in my opinion I am still glued to the set to watch every episode. Can't wait to see what happens next.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|i like this movie but its real long ...and it needs more action,the super heros take too long too get involve...
1449410243|5.0|this was purchased as a present and it is a great laugh for dog lovers who are suspicious of those other four legged furry creatures.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|What a weird premise, but if I just discontinue my disbelief just a little bit then this movie is awesome. Computer graphics are awesome too
0385523394|3.0|I won't waste time by re-telling the story but I would say this book is very average.  It's not that bad but it's also not that great.  It's fine for reading on a long flight.  It's not the most literary book ever but it's readable.  However, on finishing the book I was very disappointed in the author and slightly troubled.  Throughout the book it has a 'bad girl-turned good' kind of vibe and Kerman does bring up some interesting points, particularly about the lack of rehabilitation and help given to prisoners when released.  If what she says is true then I would have expected her to start some kind of organisation that helps rehabilitation of offenders, gives them housing advice/help etc or even to try to put pressure on politicians and effect some kind of positive action rather than just cashing in.  But it appears she has done nothing, she doesn't even mention her fellow prisioners in the gratitude section of the book and I suspect that she had no contact with her 'friends' from Danbury once she was released.  I find this kind of hypocritical, and it made me mistrust pretty much everything I had read previously in the book.
B005LAII1C|5.0|one of the funniest movies i have ever seen i never stopped laughing throughout the whole movie. Its one mark whaleberg best roles of all time and he has ever been any funnier and ted is the best character of all time
B006H5120E|5.0|Not a big fan of 3-D conversions, but I did see this in IMAX earlier in the year and it still packs a wallop.  Cameron has one of the best eyes for composition and the way he integrates the visual effects into his films is still one of the best in the business.  Someone really needs to ride herd on him when it comes to dialogue, and if Billy Zane and David Warner had switched roles this film would be flawless, but TITANIC is still entertaining as hell and both Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart together make a stunning Rose and one of them should have been recognized by the Academy.  DeCaprio does the best he can with some of the clunkiest dialogue he has ever been given, and he makes Jack a fun character that you really root for, so that when fate steps in, you feel for him.  Still a great movie after 15 years.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not her best writing.  Parts of the story are confusing and expected.  The ending was disappointing;  hardly on the edge of your seat mysterious.
1582406723|5.0|If you are getting this thinking it is going to follow the story from the tv show exactly you will be dissappointed because it does not. There are things from the show that are in the comics though. If you are a fan of the feel of the world of the tv show I think you will love the comics.Robert Kirkman has created has created an incredibly interesting world and characters that feel real. This is becoming one of my favorite comics. I recommend this to any fan of of the tv show and to anyone that may be getting tired of the regular superhero comics.
0307269752|5.0|Hollywood, and all that that entails, along with 'Broadway in NYC' have always fascinated me.  In the late 1950s, after church and Sunday dinner, with my parents napping, I would watch on our little black and white television set, the Andy Hardy movies.  It evolved, with my finally being old enough to go to the Ridglea Theater in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1956, to see the classic movies with Rock Hudson, Cary Grant, Robert Mitchum, Jane Russell, Deborah Kerr, Grace Kelly, Doris Day, and too many more to name.  Fast forward to February of 2010: Rooney Mara, the actress playing Lisbeth Salander, and the movie \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" being nominated for Academy Awards.  Never falling for 'best movie of the year' hype, I am not one to see movies at the theater; I like to wait till the dust settles, the movie is free on my cable channel, and then watch with an open mind.  The movie 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' was such a surprise to this 68-year-old senior, a rather alarming surprise because there are scenes in which I shut my eyes, but the story was all one could want.  And, it ended only leaving one wanting more.  So, I couldn't wait to read the book, and watch the movie again.  Then, I ordered the other two in the Millineum Series; there were supposed to have been ten books altogether, but Steig Larsson died suddenly before he even completed an outline for the 4th book.  What a tragedy.  I just started \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest,\\" and it is every bit as good as the first two novels about Lisbeth Salander, who I find utterly fascinating.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I think it shows how good of a director Zack Snyder really is. This movie isn't perfect but, it definitely does alot more right than it does wrong.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|QUICK SUMMARY (SPOILER ALERT)<br />The Blind Side is a heartwarming true story about the life of a young African American named Michael Oher. He grows up living in foster homes around Memphis, Tennessee, because his mother couldn't take care of him properly. He becomes friends with a young white boy, and somehow manages to win the heart of the boy's mother almost immediately. She feels the need to take care of him, and the family decides to take him in. Eventually he becomes part of the family and is officially adopted. It seems like he has a promising future in football, and eventually makes it to the NFL.<br /><br />THE TITLE<br />The title \\"The Blind Side\\" has two meanings to it. In football, which is a big part of what the movie revolves around, it refers to the area that the player cannot see, which is where he could get tackled from. Michael was the one who covered the quarterback's blind side.  This relates to the movie since Michael becomes a football player. The title also refers to what happens to the family. At first the family is a little bit resistant, as well as the family's friends who just call it \\"white guilt\\", but eventually, Michael begins to feel accepted at home and at school. The family grows closer to each other, and they seem happier than they did before Michael came along. Before Michael came, they were blind. Now they could see.<br /><br />OPENING LINES<br />The movie begins with \\"There is a moment of orderly silence before a football game begins.... Players are in position, linemen are frozen, and anything is possible. Then, like a traffic accident, stuff begins to randomly collide: from the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone, is closer to four seconds than five.\\" Leigh Anne Tuohy is narrating a football game. Then, she goes on. \\"Because as every housewife knows, the first check you pay is for the mortgage. But the second is for the insurance. And the left hand tackle's job is to protect the quarterback from what he can't see coming..... To protect his blind side.\\" This opening phrase immediately explains what the title refers to, as it is mentioned within the first three minutes of the movie.<br /><br />SUMMARY (SPOILER ALERT)<br />The movie begins with a scene at Wingate Christian School. Mike has been living with his friend, and the friend's father tries to get the two of them accepted into the school. He talks with the sports coach, who immediately sees something in Mike. Coach Cotton manages to get Mike into the school, despite his lack of proper education. Mike doesn't do too well at school, but he manages to befriend a little boy named SJ. When SJ and his parents are driving home from a school play, they see Mike walking outside in the rain. They decide to bring him home. Leigh Anne, the mother, tries to straighten out Mike's life by buying him clothes, and even driving him to the projects on the other side of town, where Mike's mother and friends live. The family becomes closer and closer to Mike, and Mike is even in the family Christmas portrait. Football tryouts are starting soon, and the coach is excited for Mike to try out. SJ tries to help him get fit, and the two become really good friends. After having the time to bond for quite some time, Leigh Anne suggest adopting Mike. As she is getting paperwork sorted out, she finds out more about Mike's past and why he was taken away from his mother. Leigh Anne decides to visit her in the projects. Mike keeps practicing football and eventually becomes the star player. Universities from all over are interested in recruiting Mike, but he first needs to get his grades up. Mike gets questioned by a social worker who suspects the Tuohy's from using him, just to get him to play for their favorite university. Mike runs away, and soon enough Leigh Anne finds him in the projects. He eventually graduates with a 2.52 GPA and goes to Ole Miss, where the rest of his new family has always gone to school.<br /><br />CAST & CREW<br />The movie was directed by John Lee Hancock, and the original book was written by Michael Lewis.<br /><br />The main cast:<br /><br />Quinton Aaron Michael Oher<br />Sandra Bullock Leigh Anne Tuohy<br />Tom McGraw  Sean Tuohy<br />Jae Head  SJ Tuohy<br />Lily Collins  Collins Tuohy<br /><br />The Supporting cast:<br /><br />Ray McKinnon Burt Cotton<br />Kathy Bates  Miss Sue<br /><br />COMMENTARY<br />I think that the performances of the actors are really great. Quinton Aaron did a great job, especially since this was his first starring role, meaning this movie was his acting debut. I also think Sandra Bullock did an amazing job. She's actually one of my favorite actresses, and having seen most of her films, I think this is definitely one of her best ones. At first, she actually refused to play the role three times, but then finally accepted after being offered the role four times. She didn't want to play a southern Christian woman, thinking people would start to make assumptions. She made the right choice by accepting the role anyway. I feel like the rest of the actors were also very good. All in all, the casting director did a great job. I only do not like Kathy Bates at certain moments, because the line is supposed to be funny or something, but then she delivers it the wrong way. Not always, but just a couple of times.<br /><br />Overall, I think everyone involved with this movie is very special because it's based on a true story. Obviously, everyone who acted in this movie really had to understand the story completely, and they really had to do \\"research\\" in order to be able to play their character so well. This proves that they are not only very talented on film, they are also interested in real life situations like this, and are willing to invest their time into really looking into the issue. Of course they knew it would be a big hit and they would earn a lot of money from it, but I'm sure they all found the story compelling. It must also have been very stressful for the actors to have to play an actual person, rather than being able to develop the character traits yourself, because obviously the real people would be judging the actors and would either approve or disapprove of the way they would be portrayed in the movie. Leigh Anne on Sandra Bullock: \\"`She wanted to know everything about me,\\" Leigh Anne Tuohy says. \\"I would take her to Ole Miss when there was nothing going on, and we would eat on the square (in Oxford). I can see why she has been so successful because she worked really hard to understand everything from my thought process of taking Michael in to how I talk.'\\" (Billy Watkins, The Clarion-Ledger)<br /><br />I also think that the storyline is really well done. Everything makes sense and happens in chronological order. The only thing that I might have changed if I had the opportunity to, was the beginning. As it is in many movies, the story \\"begins with the end\\" and then flashes back to when it all started. This method works fine with a lot of movies, but I personally wouldn't have done it with this movie. Some people might get confused at the very beginning already, and that would make the storyline just a little harder to understand. For example, my little sister was already confused at the beginning, because she didn't get how Michael went from talking to a social worker, to being in the projects. But this is just my opinion, I'm sure many other people think this was a great way to start the movie. They ended the movie very well, though. It was great how they showed real pictures of Michael Oher growing up, along with real pictures of the Tuohy family. It made everything seem much more realistic and intriguing.<br /><br />Overall, I think the movie is fantastic. The story is fascinating, and the cast and crew did a great job.<br /><br />HISTORICAL ACCURACY<br />There are many African American stereotypes addressed in this movie. The first one being the housing projects. Michael and his black friends as well as his family, all came from there. As shown in the movie, it's dirty, old, dangerous, and crowded. This is indeed how it is in some places in America. Some African Americans don't have enough money, and are forced to live in these projects as they cannot afford anything else. This creates a sort of \\"black community\\", a place where the white people would not want to be found because it's so dangerous and different. In this movie, the housing project where Michael Oher is from is called Hurt Village (it's real, not just for the movie). It started out as being a resident area for white people un Uptown Memphis, but eventually attracted many different ethnic groups and immigrants from Europe. After the Mississippi River flooding, many African Americans moved there too. During the 1960s, racial tension increased and after the assassination of Martin Luther King, most of the white people decided to leave Hurt Village. After that, most of the population consisted of African Americans, just like today.<br /><br />The housing projects and other predominantly black communities are a source of riots, fights, and other forms of violence. This is shown clearly in the movie, when Michael's mother gets evicted from Hurt Village, or when Michael gets in a fight with his friends when he comes back to visit after running away from the Tuohy's because of an argument with Leigh Anne. Therefore, I think this stereotype is accurately depicted.<br /><br />Another stereotype is about the Tuohy family, and the whites in Memphis in general. In the movie, Leigh Anne's friends don't seem to be so fond of Leigh Anne's plan of taking Michael in. They think he is dangerous and might even harm Collins. They haven't even seen him in person, but immediately assume the worst. This is what you may call a typical reaction of a Southern woman about an African American. It may be pretty old fashioned, but it definitely does still happen. This relates back to the the past when Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, and so many others were fighting for civil rights for blacks. Although Michael is definitely \\"accepted\\" in this society, he isn't \\"liked\\" particularly. There is still some tension and fear. The white people in Memphis still make assumptions about him and his family and friends in Hurt Village. For example, Leigh Anne admits she's never been to \\"this part of town\\" before, when she visits Hurt Village for the first time, even though it's very close to her home. Of course, Leigh Anne had to be that one person who takes a stand to do what is right. She was the one who broke that racial barrier and helped someone in need regardless of what they looked like, and regardless of what everyone else would think.<br /><br />WATCH IT?<br />This is definitely a movie you should watch. It's a fascinating and moving movie about the life of a promising young boy. If you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should, because it really is just a nice story, and you might as well learn something relevant to your history class, because the movie is pretty accurate when it comes to history. I think that if you're into history and southern culture regarding race, or if you're just into football, this is a great movie to watch. Who knows, you could learn so much that you might even be the next star NFL player!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|well when I got this I thought it would be fun but I'm expecting more<br />why 2.99?<br />it should be at most .99
B004XISI4A|4.0|As usual the story was well delivered and entertaining.  Must admit that I'm ready for it to come to a conclusion soon.
0345803485|4.0|I just didn't get it...Why everyone was so into Fifty Shades of Grey?  For 3 months I put off reading it, then one day I was in my public library and guess what? Yes there it is Fifty Shades of Grey staring me in the face.  What did I have to lose it is a public library and it was free to read.  Once I open that book and read the first chapter I could not put it down.  The BDMS scenes were minor compare to other books I have read.  Fifty Shades Darker and Freed concentrated more on Christian and Ana's developing but turbulent relationship.  *SPOILER* The only part I didn't much care for was when Ana became pregnant and he told her \\"How could you be so stupid?\\"  I know women can do a lot of things on there own but getting pregnant is not one of them.  Other than that I really enjoyed all 3 books.  Would I read Christian's POV if E L James write it? YES I would.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|As usual a well written story with a great plot.  Enough twists and turns to make it interesting and kept my interest.
0316010669|5.0|Good in-depth book, that makes you rethink the way you make decisions. I use this as a leisure book and really enjoy it!
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I really liked this movie, it had a very artistic touch to it. I've read alot of negative reviews about the movie, but those naysayers are full of sheet.
B00594XOZU|4.0|kik is good but i logged out on accident and forgot my password and then had to make a new one cuz it wasnt &quot;responding&quot; and it &quot; stopped unexpectadly&quot;  wats up with that.other than that little issue its GREAT!!
0393088774|5.0|I don't have much to say about this book that isn't better said by the book itself. I will say that after reading it I've been forced to rethink my objection to Keynesian economics. I've supported the ideas of Ron Paul for years, and Libertarians in general for even longer. After reading this book, I still support Libertarian philosophy on civil liberties, the drug war, overseas spending and militarism, etc... but now I object to their philosophy on economics. It doesn't seem as pragmatic, or even realistic, as I had believed it to be. Hear him out, because Krugman is a compassionate, intelligent man, and may reverse your current thinking as well. (Even if you've read Mises, Hayek, etc)
B000RIWAVW|5.0|There is no question that this is the film that started the glut of slasher movies which came after it in the late seventies and early eighties. Amazingly enough, what makes this film so good was Carpenter's short shooting schedule and his genius in organizing how to put it all together. There's nothing wasted in this movie in regard to story, pace, or just downright creepiness. It will not have the same effect on you after the first time you see it, because you'll know what's coming next; but, if you haven't seen it before, believe me when I tell you this movie has earned the title &#34;Classic Horror&#34;! The whole movie is terrific, but there are two things (without spoiling any suprises) that will stay with you: the opening sequence and that creepy theme music! I've seen this movie a hundered times and I will still watch it again when the cable channels run it every October. This one's a keeper!!!!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I DOWNLOADED TO MY KINDLE AND TAKE IT EVERY TIME I TRAVEL.  I AM SOMEWHAT OF AN INSOMNIAC AND MUST HAVE MY BACKGROUND SOUNDS TO BLOCK OUT ANY NIGHT NOISES THAT WOULD WAKE ME UP.  I HAVE A SOUND MACHINE FOR HOME AND THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER NITE TRAVEL. GREAT FOR HOME OR TRAVEL THOUGH.

B004UPANAI|5.0|In this 'batman begins' era of film making (i.e. a great story with a once mediocre movie is made into a GREAT movie), the bar set by this movie is pretty high.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the original X-man movies (1 and 3 especially), but this one kicked it up a notch for sure.<br /><br />I haven't seen an X-men movie I didn't like, but this one was my favorite
B001EN71CW|5.0|This Blu-Ray set is a perfect way to watch one of my favorite shows.  It's got awesome picture (as one would expect from a Blu-Ray), and a fun array of extras.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Really liked this movie. The acting was great and the story even better. Liam Neeson is always good and he does not disappoint. January Jones is also wonderful.
B00004YRQA|4.0|i thought that this would work for original playstation games too, but it doesnt and thats okay. i still love it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Definitly five stars. All of the best of John Grisham. Legal thriller with well developed twists. The reader can never let their guard down; just when you think you can anticipate the next move; you are shocked - again. A great read, you want a sequel; there has to be more. Believable plot and characters.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Good mindless shoot'em up with some cheesy lines that will make you laugh. The acting is laughable but who cares. Thats not what this movie is about. You have a clearly defined bad guy(s) and good guy(s). Good guy shoots, blows up, beats up and demolishes bad guy. What else would you expect from this cast? Good stuff.
B00916TU00|5.0|I was kind of upset that the CD case is an unfolding paper case instead of a plastic case.. But oh well. It's the music that counts and its great. :D
0316069434|5.0|Read the 1&2 star reviews, and they totally missed the point. This was one case, and it's development was a real page turner! It wasn't about other characters, only Bosch's bull dogged principles. Those who wanted great literary style in supporting character development were off base. The setting was made for further maturation  of Cho, O'Toole, Mendenhall, and even Maddie, but the story was the case, and I think this was the best Harry Bosch novel yet. I can't wait for the next one.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Fast and easy to use, brain and bullet proof, fast shipping, used on steak and kitchen knives, also a buck 110, and another cheapo folding pocket knife, put an edge on them all, very easy to use.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is fun and is not just a romance novel but has a good story line! Give me more!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I just couldn't put it down!  The book just drew me in.  I was holding my breath much of the time.  Would highly recommend this book to friends.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|I had never before dealt with an \\"UltraViolet Digital Download\\" before and sadly was unprepared for the absolute disappointment of trying to deal with it. The whole reason I purchased this specific version was to get a digital copy of the movie. To my extreme irritation, I was instead asked to join TWO services and download and install a program before I would be able to access my movie that I would only be able to watch through their service. This POS service has now crashed all four times I tried to download the video to my computer so that I can watch it without streaming. One of the reasons that I like digital copies is so that I can have them available through my Apple TV and watch my movies even if I lend the disc to someone else, or in the case of Up, the movie can still be watched after my toddler \\"hid\\" the disc in the dryer and ruined it...<br /><br />The point of this is save your money and just buy the DVD or just buy the digital version on iTunes. There is no reason or benefit to having the \\"UltraViolet\\" copy.
B008Y67LEK|2.0|No idea what all the fuss is about. Kinda uneven in places and just the brilliant piece of writing I expected.

B005LAII3U|1.0|First - I don't like remakes!  Second - I don't like remakes of popular films!  Third - I am tired of British people dominating American cinema - I thought that there was a revolution in 1776?  Fourth - I don't like Collin Farrell as a leading man, I just don't like his look.  Last, if it ain't broke, don't try to remake it!<br /><br />This film tries to improve upon the original with new technology and fancy effects, but that is the only thing that improved with this lousy remake.  They took away the Mars theme and traded it with the UK and it's partner in crime, Australia being the only places left on earth!  I wonder if this is saying something about our future?  They took away Mathias being a little creature with a human host, which left him being no more mysterious or fascinating than one of the buildings in the film.  The robots were more interesting, if not Star Wars-like.<br /><br />The casting was horrible too!  As mentioned, I am sick and tired of the British always starring in American movies!!  They not only play all major super heroes, but now they are in everything in a way that they do not even explain why a British person would be in the US military or be in the US playing a role in which ever film!  Given the polarization in this country, I would not be surprised if they were behind it!  Why do we keep hearing about THEIR royal family as if they are ours?  We'd better wake up!  Anyway, the cast was bad because the two principle females looked too much alike!  In the original, you had the white, blond Sharon Stone contrasting with the cute, black/hispanic Rachel Ticotin.  You had Arnold and others characters who looked distinct!  This was bad.<br /><br />Hauser throughout most of the film did not trust, know or care about any of the other characters except way into the film when Mathias is killed.  Then he reacts as if he cared when he just met the guy like 5 minutes earlier!  Then after that, he all of a sudden cares about people!  This was bad.  Then at the end, he looks dead, but of course with Hollywood clichés, you know that people never die and then the ending after that made it even worse because it looked like an added scene with no rhyme or reason.  This film had poor character development, and unlike the original, we at least liked Arnold, felt that the women were cute and sexy and the bad guys were bad.  We even had a feel as to why the people were oppressed and why the whole story existed.  Here, it was just polishing up in the looks department and that was it.  I swear, the people my age (40) who grew up with these films must be the writers and producers these days and the only thing they seem to know is to remake things or make films out of toys they loved back in the 80's.  If you need ideas, hire me!<br /><br />The remake artists in Hollywood need to know this, the original had appeal because of it's star in Arnold.  Even though the technology was limited then, the effects and look of the film had an appeal that made you want to see it.  The story as it was in the original made you care and want to see it through while with this one, I was hoping that everyone died in the end!  It looks like they set it up for a sequel - I hope not!  Since this flopped at the box office (good - the more people who stay away from remakes, the more they will abandon it), they should not do it again. I don't know why they would spend what they spent on this remake.  It was all looks and not story.  ENOUGH WITH THE REMAKES!

Even if you saw them at their peak back then, (first time i got high-great memory), you`ll love this concert! Except one reviewer`s right when he said Keith should have shaved the back of his arms...hard to look at, unless you`re a female gorilla-you`ll see! But concert is great-easily Five stars!!!

B00975L81Y|4.0|New Cradle record. Better than the last one. More guitars, more riffs, I'd say it's a guitar record. Not much strings, choirs, pure Metal, Dani sings really great.<br />I noticed one thing. When Darkly... was released, I listened to it, and I couldn't remember any song. NOW, after one listen I remember 2 songs. That must mean something :-)<br />I highly recommend this record to people who enjoy Cradle with more guitars than orchestra parts...
B00129H7VS|5.0|Being an old Army guy I love war and action movies. Over the years I have watched this series many times(not in HD though) and never tire of it. I am sure like all Hollywood telling of stories there are exaggerations, but this story is so believable, with such realism in the battle scenes it draws you in, and I just never tire of watching it.<br />If you liked Saving Private Ryan(did), or The Pacific(did not), you'll love this...get in in Blu-Ray.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved these books! The books keep you guessing what could possibly be next...great read for anyone to enjoy! Might be a good series for some men to read as well
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Very fun movie. I needed to see something light and funny.  It was also a bit touching in parts, which makes it a winner in my book.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I really loved seeing all of my favorite superheroes in on epic movie. The plot was very good and this movie is definitely worth the purchase.
B008LSVLW4|4.0|Peggy Lee was not the most technically accomplished of singers, but her whispery tone and sassy lyrical interpretations had the cool polish and sophisticated elegance of a diamond. She was a fine songwriter and lyricist as well, and one of her best-known compositions, \\"I Don't Know Enough About You,\\" appears on this digitally remastered four-CD set, a European import from Real Gone Jazz. It contains eight of her classic LPs -- 97 tracks in all, a mix of jazz standards and concept albums. Half of them were recorded for Decca, including \\"Songs From Pat Kelly's Blues,\\" a 1955 film soundtrack that also featured Ella Fitzgerald. The three remaining Decca LPs are \\"Dream Street\\" (1957), \\"Seashells\\" (1958), and \\"Miss Wonderful\\" (1959). The four albums from Capitol include \\"The Man I Love\\" (1957), \\"Jump For Joy\\" (1959), \\"I Like Men\\" (1959), and \\"Pretty Eyes\\" (1960). There are no liner notes, but the sound is crystal clear, and the low price is the frosting on the cake.

B008OOYALE|5.0|It is a great little game. Enjoy the idea behind it and the execute it very well.  I really enjoy playing this game.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|Really liked the music, even the covers Tom Cruise and others did, as it brought me back to those middle school and high school years music-wise. Cruise is over-the-top and, like the other characters, entertainingly superficial. The movie was better than I had anticipated it would be. As a musical movie, it is no &#34;Grease&#34; but is quirky and entertaining enough to be a fun view and definitely different than a lot of the other same old fare.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This book is about a young boy who dreams of being in the kings army, the Legion.  As the story builds you find the boy is very young and has not explored anything. He earns his way into the Legion and is learning along the way. He falls for the kings daughter and has a few intense moments, but not the wow you expect from Morgan that I have come to love. This was a good read and can only hope that the next installlment is even better.

B004GVUPFE|1.0|Come on, really? Do you think the average Amazon reviewer would type like that?<br /><br />Other than the fact that it's obviously derivative, the difference that makes this game worse than it should is that it keeps track of how many moves you make and judges you for them. That adds unnecessary pressure that a certain unamed game on the iPhone market (that will remain unnamed) does not have, and is a better game for it.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|I've collected everything so far in the series, always a variety of music- something for everyone. I was starting together used to hearing a selection from Stephenie Meyer's favorite group Muse-  guess they made their last appearance with the Eclipse soundtrack.<br />Most of the selections are pretty good, # 8 &#34;I didn't mean it&#34; by The Belle Brigade and # 9 &#34;Sister Rosetta&#34; by the Noisettes are just mostly loud to me.<br /> Mia Maestro, &#34;Carmen&#34;,  has a selection from some CD she was working on during filming, # 14 ''I Lovera&#34;, it's not bad but the two selections I'd most likely want on my iPad are # 6 &#34;A Thousand Years&#34; by Christina Perri, (there's a video of it on the Wal Mart edition of this movie), and # 15 &#34;Love Death Birth&#34; by Carter Burwell. He's done a much better score than he did for Twilight.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|An epic tale of Knights and Dragons. You have to love it for the raw a gritty depictions to the color brought to life on the pages.
B005ZHBA9I|4.0|The only tune that I think I really liked on Mr. Burwell's score for Twilight was &#34;Bella's Lullaby&#34;, I thought &#34;Why him?&#34; When I heard that he'd been chosen to finish out the series. This one's a great improvement although I found a common theme running through many of the selections (you'll hear &#34;lullaby&#34; more than once). Some selections are so short that if you don't pay attention you'll miss them and some just seem to flow one from another, you'll only realize something is &#34;new&#34; if you're looking at your counter.<br />Robert Pattinson's sister Lizzie did vocal work on Twilight, she's listed here in the credits- I think she must be the voice on # 7 &#34;A Nova Vida&#34;, probably my favorite selection on the CD.

B003SI9WYG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I can't exactly put my finger on what made this movie great, but believe me - it was!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|If one can get past the first chapter of  Tom Rob Smith's debut novel Child 44, one finds a first rate thriller.  It is one of those which you find yourself gripping the pages and refusing to put down.  We begin in the Soviet Union during the famine of the 1930's and then jump to the 1950's and the waning days of the Stalin era.<br /><br />We are introduced to Leo Demidov, a true believer and operative in the MGB, the Soviet Intelligence Agency prior to the formation of the KGB.  Leo has everything going for him, he was a war hero, has a beautiful wife, Raisa,  his career is taking of and because of the privileges of MGB agents he has a nice apartment and he has been able to provide one for his parents as well.<br /><br />But in Stalinist Russia, things are never quite what they seem, everyone has to be guarded in their interactions and work towards survival and Leo's world starts tilting when he is asked to investigate the death of a colleagues child.  Because there is no crime in the Soviet Union the child's death is ruled an accident and Leo refuses to investigate and advises his colleague to accept the ruling.<br /><br />The book is loosely based on the case of mass murderer Andrei Chitakilo, but set in the 1950's rather than the 80's .  From my perspective this change in times makes it more intriguing as Stalin's Russia presented a very precarious time and the shifting uncertainties immediately following his death provided opportunities for those with the vision to take chances.<br /><br />I was impressed with Smith's development of the main characters Leo and Raisa and their uncertain relationship and interdependency.  This hooked me and I look forward to reading more about them in his following novels of the trilogy  The Secret Speech and Agent 6.<br /><br />When reading a thriller one should be aware that there are times in which one has to stretch belief and I had know problem doing that.  I was able to accept a growing number of coincidences, however I did have some trouble believing the motive of the killer.<br /><br />I would also like to caution readers that this is about the murder of children and I do have some personal problems reading about that.  Because this was based on a real case I was more able to accept it.have some trouble believing the motive of the killer.<br /><br />I would also like to caution readers that this is about the murder of children and I do have some personal problems reading about that.

B006MGB31Q|5.0|I recently had to upgrade my Alien collection from standard DVDs to Blue Ray format.  The Alien saga is a must have. I grew up with the original Alien in the 80s. It’s the original sci-fi Horror movie and nothing today has ever come close to topping it. And never will, as Alien is truly the Godfather of all sci-fi  movies today. This collection is nice to have…what else is there to say, accept buy it now!
B001NB6IN8|2.0|This is my favorite band, I don't think I even listened to this album more than twice.  It was hard to keep up with their progression that took them from Take This To Your Grave to FAD, but I would buy it anyway because I will always support these guys.  I loved Patrick Stump's recent solo album and I get that this album is largely his brainchild...but I think the &#34;hiatus&#34; or whatever they are calling it was a good idea.  Fall Out Boy should stick to what they do best, pop punk and spoiled rotten angst.  But, we've all grown up and moved on I guess!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game you muskrats get but you can't blow up TNT in cratice mod. kind Sufis. but very good game.
B0000028M7|5.0|This album still rocks 20 years later.  A rock classic, heavy and fun.  I listen to it all the time, one of the best from the grunge era.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Lots to do. cute and entertaining. I've never really been into my little pony but this game is def fun
067960085X|5.0|Amazing, OBVIOUSLY.  This was one of the first books that I read where I thought to myself &#34;Not one word in that book was a mistake&#34;.  A wonderful book, one of my favorites, and one I will read time & time again like it's an old friend.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved the Book! Great read,can't wait to read more books by the same author! So good couldn't stop reading the book!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I really liked this book.  I liked how it was written in a series of letters that kept you guessing about the fate of the recipient.  I like true crime books and psychology so this was a nice fiction path to take.  The book stayed with me for quite some time after reading it.  It was disturbing to say the least!<br /><br />That said, DO NOT see the movie.  Horrible horrible horrible.  Not just a horrible adaptation that positively ruins the book, but an all around horribly lame movie that would have been awful on its own.  It's a shame because the book was excellent.
B0098460O4|5.0|With numerous online purchases, this is the first review ever submitted. Couldn't wait for release, HAD TO HAVE IT.  This music is SO relaxing & inspirational at the same time. I have shared Jonathan & Charlotte's story & music with everyone that would listen. The grandchildren(6, 8, & 9)  love opera now.  ...guess what they will be getting for Christmas from Nana ;)
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game is so.awesome but after a while it gets a litle boring in creative mode but that is my only criticism.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Scrabble has not worked that much since I downloaded it.  The first time it should take that long to load...but all of the other times.  Words with Friends just loads every time...you don't have to wait every time for it to find your games like you do with Scrabble.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|[[ASIN:1475143389 Bigger Leaner Stronger: The Simple Science of Building the Ultimate Male Body (The Build Healthy Muscle Series)]]excellent book I ge read and tried many workout books this one is very good with the least amount a bs and straight to the point on what to do and what not to do three thumbs up
B008X9Z37A|4.0|The cover seems sturdy enough to last a while.  There are two suggestions I have for you.  First, have somewhere to attach your business card to it for identification purposes and second, retractable handles would be nice.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Our whole family loves this light-hearted Christmas movie! Makes you laugh, but also makes you think aboutthe importance of sharing the season with loved ones!
B0045EJY90|4.0|I like my Teac CD-P650, it has surpised me on how good and simple it is to operate. This is one of the better ones out that I have seen without spending a mint to get. I enjoyed the time it shows how much it is into any one track, plus it showes you how much time is left. So I give it high marks.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun simple game. ponies what could b better? very cute too and u can find derpy if u scroll around
B003CN4R74|5.0|\\"Fallen\\" was an amazing debut, \\"The Open Door\\" was extremely well made and just as good in a different way, and now the band's third self titled album follows the trend of being just as impressive as the last album in another kind of way. A lot of people will say that this sounds more mainstream or is more catchy than the last 2 albums but wasn't their first single ever that put them on the map pretty catchy (Bring Me To Life)?<br /><br />That being said, on this album Evanescence has some more heavy riff oriented songs with strings that evoke the sound of \\"Fallen\\" but also have some songs that continue where \\"The Open Door\\" left off in terms of experimentation and sound. There are also a couple straight up rockers and a couple ballads. In every song it's evident that Amy Lee has gotten even more powerful and passionate over the years; her voice sounds so sincere and commanding at times and other times so delicate and dreamy. Her lyrics are a bit more gloomy here than on \\"The Open Door\\" but aren't as dark as they are on \\"Fallen\\". The words are kind of a common ground between pain and hope.<br /><br />This album may have a couple songs that are more accessible to the mainstream but definitely not because the band made them to be that way. To me, this is another step in the right direction for the band.<br /><br />Some fans who dismissed Evanescence when Ben Moody left after \\"Fallen\\" may never be able to see the band the same way again but if they listen to this with an open mind, I'm sure there are a lot of songs here for them to appreciate.<br /><br />For fans who loved both albums, definitely pick this up; if you're a fan of Evanescence this will not disappoint you.
B004GVUPFE|1.0|I see no reason for it. And of course they don't say it,  only when you click during installation to see the other permissions (which only one is listed so I don't see the point of not listing one more). If they have to be sneaky about it then I don't trust it.
B001GM28HO|5.0|My introduction to Lady Gaga was \\"Pokerface\\" and that song was undeniably catchy but it got so much mainstream attention and airplay that \\"the fame\\" kind of killed it for me so I never thought I'd ever bother getting an album by her.<br /><br />So 4 years later I get \\"The Fame\\" and listen to it the whole way through and I was pretty surprised. Lady Gaga is much more than just the song \\"Pokerface\\"; she is very unique and eclectic in how she structures her songs and how the music is arranged and executed. A couple songs are kind of 'strictly for the club' dance songs that I appreciate but can't listen to much. The majority of this album is extremely impressive though. She reminds me of a female Prince/Beck that's more mainstream and accessible. The lyrics aren't always deep on her songs, a lot of them are about dancing in the club or bluntly about sex. However, she actually does make really thought provoking lyrics on songs like \\"Paparazzi\\" and the title track (as well as a couple other ones I can't think of offhand).<br /><br />Bottomline here, don't go into this album with skepticism because of the media's huge coverage of her. Listen to this with an open mind and you might actually find yourself liking some of the songs here, if not finding something to like about all of them. This isn't for everyone but it definitely accomplishes the goal of making music fused in so many genres so accessible to the masses.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Coming, as I do, from Scots who never mastered the use of consonants in their speech, listening to the voice actors was a trip down memory lane<br /><br />I was struck by the surprising amount of female executive and creative talent that went into this production. It proves...if a boy can do it, a girl can do it, and that's pretty much the message of this enjoyable tale.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|A marginal Batman portrayal.  wasted my $$.  Even a sexy woman foil did not save this tedious film.  WAsted time watching it.
1933492953|5.0|Mateu-Mestre's book deserves much more attention than it gets. I think that's because so few artists understand what pictorial composition is and that it, and it alone, creates the mood, the tone of voice and the emotional message of your pictures.<br /><br />This is one of the best books written about this difficult-to-master aspect of professional art.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I can't seem to get into this book.  It moves slowly and I don't know if I'll finish it.  I loved the Harry Potter books, so thought this would be very good.  Very disappointing.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Shinedown just keeps getting better! So great to see good guys do well, the live show is awesome - see them if you havn't!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is certainly a good read makes you feel good about life after death.  A very uplifting story of life and death

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series with high production values! I look forward to the next installment. The backdrops they use really do take you to another era.
B0037VNX44|1.0|They should just give him one in the back of the head. Take him out of his bloody misery as well that of the society.<br />This movie sucks.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Fantastic, gripping film for young and old. Especially inspirational for young girls, with a gutsy, strong lead character. A film for everyone, it is funny, adventuresome and quite thrilling!
B002VWNIDG|5.0|A must have I love this movie total classic! I recommend any buying it and watching it its worth it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is super cool. you con do anything in creative mode.  But my favorite is survival mode G-man out

0345803493|5.0|really great book wife loved it and plans to read third installment hoping to get it soon for her to read
0321885112|5.0|Mike Rohde does fantastic work. After talking with many talented artists, I hired Mike to create the interior artwork for The $100 Startup. He did an excellent job and I continue to hear positive comments (almost daily!) on how the illustrations mesh so well with the text.<br /><br />But this review isn't about my book; it's about Mike's. In The Sketchnote Handbook, Mike takes us behind-the-scenes, documenting the process and workflow he uses in his unique method. Learning about how Mike does it is interesting enough to me, a non-artist, to justify the purchase of the book. However, Mike goes further and makes the case that *everyone*--even you and me--can use visual note-taking to improve the way we capture and retain information.<br /><br />It's a no-brainer: This book deserves a wide audience! I've purchased multiple copies already and will continue to buy more as I hand them out as gifts.
B0063IH60K|5.0|nothing fancy just an app of the classic card game... app works great on kindle fire.. no issues so far.
B009HELT3C|5.0|I love the MIB series ( even though #2had it faults,) and this one stands up to the quality the first one original set forth
B00004Z459|5.0|I grew up to this album basically. I remember staying up with this in my CD player in middle school. I would listen to the WHOLE album. I loved EVERY song. They had such a unique sound. I still have this album, the CD cover is in two pieces but it still protects the CD.<br /><br />The new Linkin Park is just... not the same.<br /><br />But this album is what separated them from all the other rock grounds. Or the Nu-Metal (they aren't metal though, but the rapping and rock combination).<br /><br />This is now considered Old school Linkin Park.<br /><br />If you want to know what the best rock music with rap elements were, this is it.<br /><br />\\"In the end\\" was a ground breaking song as well. With a rich sound, great rapping, and the voice of Chester Bennington which just grabs you within! You just want to yell with him in every song.<br /><br />I've decided I won't review every song... maybe 10 years too late. But most of these songs about individuality, maybe sometimes \\"emo\\". Most of the songs are based on Chester's struggles growing up and the stress he had gotten from his parents. So if you need some rock/rap to relate to, this is it.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|We all know the difference between picking up a book that's &#34;okay&#34; and finding a book that's simply wonderful to read.  This collection of stories most definitely falls into the latter category.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Enjoy playing this game! It is challenging and fun especially you play the time trial. I enjoy playing through the levels without being timed as well.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Plum Island has something for every reader. Great plot,lots of action.You name it it's in there.You will hate for the story to end.
0425263916|5.0|I love Crossfire. I think it is the best work from Sylvia Day. I am waiting for third book in this series
B009PU2KIQ|1.0|Headlines says it all. This album just isnt any good. You can feel that it is the work of a major studio. Every song sounds like its been focused grouped. Go get the first album, it is really spectacular.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Excellent service and price. Very Orden and full shipped. Excelent presentation. Good work. Its very nice item. Full services and Very type.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|Unfunny, unsexy, cliched, boring, trite, not worth spending any more time on this review.  Don't waste your time on this crap.
B001KEGRCA|3.0|There are some very nice images but this is not a film about the wonders of the Grand Canyon.<br />This is a political film about the environment.
0596805888|5.0|Awesom cause this was just what i was looking for to get as a gift. Will recomend to anyone for anyone.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|This is the Talking Heads at the top of their game. One of the best recorded rock concerts and Blu-ray just made it way better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. i can't wait to see what happens next. This is one show that my husband both enjoy watching togather.
B008OHV4PG|3.0|Enjoyed the movie, but there was too much bass and I know Mr. Young wanted it that way, but it was a real distraction.
B009X01D9U|5.0|Fast delivery, packed well, good quality product, works great w/ my Kindle Fire 8.9&#34;. The tablet can be conveniently set verticaly or horizontally. I am pleased w/ the product I received. Thank you.<br />Highly recommend.
B000002KDI|3.0|Enjoyed hearing and seeing this concert. I am a real Neil Young fan and really like the old stuff. Thanks Neil.
B009HEN7LY|5.0|In this installment of MiB, I was pleasantly surprised with a great story and amazing supporting cast. After seeing MiB2, I didn't have a lot of hope for this movie. I'm glad I gave it a try, though and urge anyone hesitant to watch based on similar feelings to go ahead and give it a try.
0316228532|5.0|Completely and totally different from J.K. Rowlings previous works but still amazing in a totally different regard. Highly recommended to any Rowling or literature fans.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|The movie is great obviously but the digital copy code is expired so you will need to email paramount to get a new one and they take awhile to reply
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie is both poignant and amusing.  The characters are well-drawn and believable.  I recommend it to viewers from their forties on.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Terrific series.  Always looking forward to the next episode. Dark and for the mature views only I'd say.  Keep this series going!
B0053KWDES|5.0|bought this amp with extra battery and charger and use it primarily with my brand new ipod and sony xb 500 headphones, WOW!!  Boom Boom shake the room tic toc tic tic boom... if you use this as it was intended to you will not be disappointed, if i could give 10 stars i would... make sure you have decent headphones to handle the expanded DB range, if your using junk headphones, it will sound like junk....
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|Interesting special effects, story line okay, acting fairly good, all in all worth watching. The strongest point was the special effects.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|entire series in 1 dvd case. i move often and this is perfect since it takes very little space.<br />this won't be a review of the series, but needless to say i love it :)
B002NZTZ8S|3.0|It was an excellent in the  animated sense,  but as I was watching with our 5 year old grandson, and 9 year old granddaughter, we discovered the train ride antics were quite a bit scary, especially for the 5 year old.  Actually, we were a little bit surprised that they had to include such parts, especially knowing young ones would be watching.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|i'm not going to buy imaginary coins with real money.  you should make the free experience last longer, at least 100 coins each time it refills...
1400082773|1.0|Arrogant..... self serving and not worth the paper it is printed on.  It was a waste of money to me.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|It was Great! I couldn't stop laughing and now I can see it on all of my favorite devices anytime!
B001MEJY8W|1.0|Really weird.  I cannot recommend this movie and am sorry I bought it.  The best I can say is, it fills in some dead time.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really enjoyed this story.  I found myself wondering what was going to happen next the whole time.  I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys thrillers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Didn't think I would like the Hunger Games until I got into them & couldn't stop reading!!  Didn't see the book ending the way it did but liked it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven is the most important book I have read in 70 years since I learned to read in 1st grade. IT is a validation of my religious beliefs as set forth by Mary Baker Eddy in her book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, which has been my spiritual guide since birth. Dr Alexander. Scientifically proves what Mrs Eddy revealed 150 years ago--that man is not material, he is spiritual.
075669812X|5.0|Exactly what I was waiting for!! Great for Christmas gift!  I recommend the purchase of the item; it great for kids.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|The Duchess War is my favorite Courtney Milan book yet. Minnie and Robert will capture your heart from the very beginning and never let go.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Glad we waited to see this till came out on DVD rather than seeing it in the theater...felt like 20 minutes or so could have been cut from the middle of the movie. I read reviews where people complained that Batman didn't show up till 30 minutes in, and then that the ending was great; I felt the opposite, the beginning didn't bother me w/o Batman and the ending felt a bit too trite. Catwoman could have been a lot more edgy and interesting but was WAY too quippy. She was better in the first half. Not nearly as gritty and well-acted as the second movie. Worth seeing, but it isn't a masterpiece.
0316069434|5.0|During the 1992 South Central riots, LAPD Det. Harry Bosch and his partner Jerry Edgar are dispatched to a investigate a murder of an unknown female. The body is in the middle of the riot zone, and due to circumstances, all Bosch and Edgar can do is a brief \\"meatball,\\" investigation into the death of what we discover is an attractive Danish journalist. Things have gotten out of control and the murder victims are piling up, so Bosch and Edgar have to quickly move onto their next \\"meatball,\\" investigation.<br /><br />Flash forward to today. Bosh is working in the LAPD's cold case unit when he comes across the above mentioned unsolved \\"Snow White\\" case. The usual Bosch formula kicks in:<br /><br />1. Some people are rooting for Bosch to succeed, but many are not.<br />2. The LAPD Brass is uncomfortable with Bosch doing what he does. In this case, The Brass is concerned that it will look politcally incorrect if the only South Central riot case solved by the cold case squad involves the murder of a white foreign journalist. And an attractive blonde to boot. As such, The Brass sets out to make life difficult for Harry.<br />3. Connelly tells an interesting story.<br />4. Connelly tells a realistic story, and this is what puts him at the top of the crime writers pyramid. His story, his characters and his police work all seem pretty realistic.<br />5. Bosch works his case one piece at a time, building piece upon piece until, finally, some kind of justice is acheived.<br /><br />If you would like to read an interesting murder investigation story that is very well told, this superior police procedural is for you.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love this CD. Susan's singing of one of my favorite all times songs The Music of the Night is fabulous. The Winner Takes It all is  also so beautifull. I highly recommend this CD..
B001706I5I|5.0|ALways loved this movie.. I think its Jim Careys best!  Finally got the blu ray version and its even better.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Good quality on the video. Of the bond series it was in no way a favorite. In fact, it was a little to violent for my taste and needed more story.
B004UJAOLM|2.0|I know it's a classic, and I appreciate that it's well written; however, the characters are just not awful, especially the protagonist.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Good movie, best of the series! This movie made me want it to be longer, and yet it was a long movie itself.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I enjoyed the movie but bought it to try out for my 6-year-old son.  I think there are parts that he'd need a little more background to understand.  It has made me curious about the books, though.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I would not recommend this ap unless parental controls are on. Deceptive marketing to get kids to spend as much as 99.99 for game additions. Not at all what I expected from such an innocent little pony.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best show on the market , equal to breaking bad and soa , weeds,sopranos ,mecum auto<br />Keep it coming , great.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Been watching this for years with my sons - and they know most of the dialogue and one liners pretty well by now. This is just a fun movie to watch, corny as it is but who out there can't relate the story to some of their own Christmas memories?. For me, this flick is a holiday must have!
B00479SVBU|5.0|I hooked this up to my 2006 GTO and it works great. The quality of the sound is one of the best from a FM transmitter.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Honestly the movie I would rate 3stars but I love Tom Hardy, he is a beautiful talented actor! I Love You Tom Hardy!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Can't go wrong. It's Eva. This first movie is a pretty faithful retelling of the first handful of episodes. Looks great on Bluray.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Paul Tough does a great job of explaining the new research on character education, while interweaving stories of students throughout the country who illustrate his point. Great read for educators and parents.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Looks very good, the animation is wonderful. Story-wise, a little divergent from the anime, but still very good. We'll see what the 3rd movie brings here pretty soon. (Q1 2013?)
B004G600A4|5.0|I found this new Tangled DVD in new perfect condition as advertised.  I would recommend this purchase to all.  I gave it a 5 star rating as it was easy to order, arrived in the time frame and in new condition as advertised.
B000N0WCLC|5.0|Probably one of the better roles for DiCaprio. The Blu-ray is very crisp and clear, showing off the beautiful scenery. Audio is great as well, with bullets whizzing by during the more intense actions scenes. The other reviews have done a much better job that I could with the story review, so I'll leave that to them.
B000YHG72E|5.0|A good movie if you are in the mood for silly good-natured comedy. We had a good time watching it.
B000002572|5.0|I can remember when I was 17 and this record came out. I rushed to the store and it was out. I walked town up and down looking for it and couldn't find it. I went into town for 6 straight weekends until I finally got it. I played it in my record player until my neighbors would complain about the noise...Who cared? It was Boston!!! Come on!!! Just a great addition to my collection.

1451695195|5.0|I have read a few NDE books and this one is one of the best.  Because he is a brain doctor, it is very intelligent and believable.
B00006JMQG|5.0|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari - 1920<br /><br />I've just experienced, quite possibly, one of the most beautiful films I have ever, ever seen.<br /><br />The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is considered one of the best horror films of the silent era.  Filmed in the dark and twisted film movement of German Expressionism, falling into the storyline is akin to falling into a dream/nightmare abstraction of light & shadow combined with distorted shape & size that lasts an unbelievably short 75 minutes.  Not too far into the film, it becomes beautifully obvious that Tim Burton must be a fan of the movie, if not the director himself.<br /><br />Th Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is the very first movie *of all time* to employ the use of a twist-ending.  Not only that, it was also one of the very first movies to be non-linear.  It begins with the telling of a memory; a re-tellling of the past bringing it to the present *with some extra memories thrown-in* and beyond.<br /><br />Basically it's about a crazed doctor (Dr. Caligari) paired with a somnambulist who have a carnival show and go about commiting 'ghastly murders' at night in a German town.  The cabinet referred to in the title is the box (that looks like a coffin) the somnambulist sleeps in.  The word 'somnabulist' is used quite frequently in the film.<br /><br />The film is surprisingly in color in that it was filmed in different sepia tones; brown and blue most predominately.  This adds to the general creepiness of the film but the acting can't be overlooked either; it's simply brilliant.  The sets are a tribute to a mind on mushrooms ... they're beautifully distorted in the way realism truly is.<br /><br />Definitely, definitely a must watch for those who truly enjoy good film.  It's a horror film, to be sure, but this truly ranks as one of the best movies I've ever watched.  Incredibly artsy-fartsy, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligary is a trip into the imagination of the director and one I'll be tripping into again very, very soon ...<br /><br />*Somnambulist - look it up ...<br /><br />*After you watch the film, share with me where  you see \\"Jack\\" from Tim Burton's \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\".<br />So wonderful to see the hand of a past director pressed in a firm handshake against the palm of a present one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like to keep my brain in gear! I'm hoping this will help me to keep it going! I will try.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have minecraft on my computer an I love it, so I got this thinking it would be awesome too. I play it for awhile, do and make a bunch of cool stuff, make a house, then I turn my kindle off because it was going to die. I turn it back on and get on minecraft after my kindle is charged and I have my inventory, but anything that was placed on the ground was not there. so I love minecraft but this does not save your progress.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This was fun for a while. After you win all the prizes, it kinda gets boring! Had to stop playing.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love drogons du thay have power's and stuff its cool and brave. and thay will I don't now so?
B009FZFONO|5.0|excellent show based on lengthy character development.  Would recommend for anyone who appreciates a good TV show.  Still need 3 more words.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I only read all three books because I had already downloaded them to my Kindle.  I did not enjoy the way the Author wrote in the manner of an immature young girl writing her first novel.  The book, in my opinion, has been way over rated.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great complexity of plot and well framed for plausibility by couching in contemporary Middle East issues. Flynn continues to develop and reveal more detail with key characters in Rapp series.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great disc for the price; quick shipping; new movie in perfect condition; great for viewing after reading the book; product just as described
B009LL4LMM|4.0|Game is addictive and really fun.  I am glad I downloaded it.  I feel anyoneelse who downloads the game will enjoy it too.
B009JBZH54|5.0|One of my favorite Blu Ray collections that I've bought. The case it came in is fresh. The quality of the sound and visuals are top of the line. The order itself came in earlier than originally estimated. I am very happy with this purchase.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies around, I get chills everytime. Really brings you into the Christmas spirit, we really enjoyed out family movie night with this one.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Read this each night before I went to bed. Easy read with characters that you can definitely fall in love with.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|SUPER FUNNY AND FILLED WITH LAUGHTER<br />It is supercalifragilisticexpialadotios also the best of the wimpy kid series so far :)
B00914JWSW|2.0|I can't remember any of songs on it.  Nothing catches<br />and stays with you like most of her music.  Need to try it again<br />see if I was in a mood.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|The puzzles are simple to solve, so the biggest challenge is finding necessary objects. Wish it had been a bit longer. A couple of bugs. In chapter 2,  the map crashes the game. But there are so few locations that you don't need the map anyway. Also, the tiles in the yellow absorption device were entirely unresponsive for some time. Took a step back and reopened the puzzle 3 or 4 times before it finally responded to taps.<br /><br />No regrets about the purchase, though. Creative premise that could have been expanded. Would have been more fun having to travel to different dates, rather than reassembling the time machine, but that would have required paying an artist for more graphics, and made the game more expensive.
B008ELUEQC|2.0|Another bland cd,  nothing catchy enought to want to sing along.<br />Very disappointed in Rod.  He can do much better.
0545265355|2.0|So I'm halfway through the first book and so far, I must say, I'm not disappointed. I am, however, Disappointed at the condition of the catching fire book... I'd like to know why in the hell the Cover is sliced down the middle, as if a razor has been taken to it. if that's not bad enough, when I took it off to look at the hardback of the book, it's been sliced too. I love the books, and that's not the reason for the low rating, It's because the book was in used condition-- which is strange, considering the pack was warped up and all.
034580404X|5.0|I really loved this series and once I started I really couldnt put it down,.i was so engrossed in the books!
0316113506|5.0|This is by the guy who wrote Driven to Distraction.  It's one of those books that will change your strategy for educating your children - especially if you're dealing with a special needs child.  I bought five copies for a group that advocates for special needs children and gave them away.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best diary of a wimpy kid book yet I totally adore this book and I think everyone should love it too ;) :) i read it almost a million times
B009FZHYKU|5.0|enjoy getting new episodes online so quickly- 24 hrs after it hits TV. I am glad the episodes are stronger this season
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book great story a lot more to it than sex have an open mind and get carried away to a place that seems plausible
B002PNF8HK|2.0|Brotherhood of the Wolf- far superior- writing-acting. Effects good- relied on  special effects too often. The story line needed to be developed in order to make sense
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great ending to a great story definitely a must read let yourself fall into a book that seems completely real
0525952926|5.0|Just heard from a fellow reader that she is in the midst of this one and can't keep her focus off this one. It's hard to put it down once you start. I know I loved teh first in the trilogy so this one promises to be great, also!
B005QUQP76|3.0|I love this mouse.  Without a doubt they have been some of the best gaming mice I have ever used.  The fit and finish are excellent, the feel is good, and the software that comes with it is great.  The braided cabled is long and thin.  The aluminum frame gives it a good weight and the postion of the buttons is ideal.<br /><br />What I don't like about them is that there really is no use the for CROSSAIR button, (Remap it to something more important like zoom, or health if you are into gaming.)  The wheel functions feels flimsy and lacks any clicking tactile feel to it.  It won't work in most bios.  And the right and left click buttons wear out far to quickly.  My experience has been under 5000 clicks and they get soft and unresponsive.<br /><br />I think the button and mouse wheel issues are more or else due to the fact that they are made in CHINA.  I have had two mice replaced now from corsair without issue.  Albeit the cost of shipping them back isn't cheep.<br /><br />Pros -<br />1. Excellent look<br />2. Excellent feel<br />3. Good weight<br />4. Lots of options<br />5. Long Braided cabel<br /><br />Cons -<br />1. Mouse wheel lacks tactile feel when being used.<br />2. Click buttons wear out way way way to quickly.  (function wise)<br />3. Won't work correctly in or with ASUS bios.<br />4. Sniper Button has no real benefit. - remap it.<br />5.
0698116496|5.0|Got this for my 2 year old grandson for Christmas, so I know it will be a hit.<br />Love ordering off a wish list.
B001AQO3WY|4.0|An interesting account.  I wouldn't want to be there.  I am grateful for those who went and did what they did.
B008K5T5AI|3.0|I am an Iain Banks fan. I have loved his culture novels. This one though seems to go nowhere fast. The culture Minds just seem to be bored and chasing around the galaxy for no real reason other than to satisfy their egos and alleviate boredom. I shared their boredom with aspects of the story. The story seems to be pointless and it never seems to go anywhere. That being said the story, such that it is, is well-written.
0316069434|2.0|I am an avid reader of all things Connelly, and I'm sorry to say that I was rather disappointed by this book. I've always thought of Connelly's writing as quasi-non-fiction in that he has an uncanny talent for telling a fictitious tale that is plausible in its entirety. This is where \\"The Black Box\\" falls short. The ending was a let-down, and my eyes began to glaze over as Bosch made his completely fantastical escape from the barn coupled with the highly improbable arrival of a relatively unrelated detective on the scene (wow, and just in the knick of time!). Ho-hum. I feel like Connelly just tired of the story and very sloppily brought it to a close. Thanks for \\"phoning it in\\" Mr. Connelly. We expect more from you.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|If your case can hold it then get it. The price is low and it will give you some nice overclocking roon
B00956UPSW|4.0|Not Pantera but it is a good piece of Metal Witchtripper instant hit, but this album and single will be cult classics and will be enjoyed by Metalheads for years to come!!!!!!!\m/..\m/
B00AA7O22U|3.0|I was disappointed in this film after seeing the Expendables.  There seemed to be almost no plot or character build up.  It was almost one action scene after another with no skeleton to hang them on.
B0052WBIFC|5.0|The description on Amazon said that this DVD was of PAL format but was actually NTSC (north American DVD region... Plays in a regular player). Great DVD, and in bonus features, you get another concert to watch from a Scotish festival.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Game is great to play; however glitches and closes when I level up. I would recommend nonetheless to others. Yup.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great read!  Grishman is one of my favorite authors, read all his books and this one rates one of the best!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Have not finished book yet but what I have read is fascinating . The way Lincoln is portrayed is superb and the insight into all his cabinet members and the politics of that time period is written very well . This author has done her homework and presents a fine piece of reading.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I enjoyed movie Vampire teens in love verses werewolfs and then<br /> the love triangle is what makes this an Interesting movie . usually<br /> it's vampires or werewolfs . but this movie is about both coexisting.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Spent alot of time of this game to get to upper levels only to have is all wiped out by charging my battery on my Kindle Fire.<br />Bye Bye app. If you want to waste alot of time this is the game for you because in a heartbeat is is gone.....
B0096CDG0O|3.0|Good time killer. I do feel u shouldb able to end a game if ur opponent hasnt made a play in a given time. Ive got 6 opponets that havent done anything in 2 or more days. It is kinda annoying seein them on the &quot;play&quot; list.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|This has got to be one of the greatest triumphs ever in Popular Music.  Annie Lennox was not just aiming at Christmas Mode Music, no, she was obviously going after ringing up humanity's most sublime feelings and emotions, ranging from pathos through exuberance to rapture and then even transcendent ecstasy.  Christmas, in the conception of Annie Lennox's Christmas Cornucopia,  is not only not just the big secular holiday it has become for most of us, and it is not even simply a Christian Religious Holiday, but goes on to become a monumental Universal Event and a pivotal and central Experience for All Mankind.  It depicts God as Pure Innocence coming into the World through Suffering in order to relieve Suffering and to auger in a New Pure World where everything is right and we all finally agree to make all things Fair.  The songs are riddled with these messages, along with Angelic Choirs, and blaring crescendos of Messianic Promise.  We have songs about frozen moments of Satori Experience.  We have songs of Christmas, the Divine Birth in the Present Tense, Songs of Christmas as prophecy of some fabulous future event.  There is not much looking back, as the Christmas Cornucopia is looking more at Christmas as a huge Existential Now.  A final song penned by Annie Lennox goes so far as to introduce a New Conception of God and Theology - that God is as much slowed down and encumbered by the Material World as we all are, but with all of our Active Help, with the Wind and Current of God's Purpose at our backs pushing us forward to reach our own highest levels of voluntary Goodness, Divinity in all of its Perfection can finally be made to Shine Through and uplift our World, fulfilling that Ancient Messianic Christmas Promise.<br /><br />Be careful playing this CD in your car.  This is not just foot-tapping music.  You may be taken up well beyond the concern for Red and Green lights, and it may be difficult to see the traffic flow through the fog of your tears of wonder.<br /><br />This CD came out a few years back in 2010, and I had played it last year, for more than a month.  This year I was almost afraid to dig it out of the CD pile.  What if the Magic I remembered had worn off?  But, no.  if anything, it was more intense than ever.  I knew where all the ecstatic triggers were and was ready to respond.<br /><br />Oh, you may think I am very suggestible and am simply a sucker for Christmas Music.  Well, don't you think I thought the same thing myself ?  So I got everybodies' Christmas CDs.  Well, most were not bad, well, except for Aimee Mann's \\"Just Another Drifter in the Snow\\", so cynical and bitter that one fears that Ms. Mann has come to thoroughly believe all her own Market-niche balderdash - that disgusted, disgruntled, sarcastic and sardonic People would simply love to have their own taste in Christmas Music, making it an odd curio for what must be a new low for our collapsing Civilization.  She has obviously given up on any `Rescue'.  Oh, don't get me wrong!  I love Aimee Mann... or I guess I used to.  It is true her other CDs are beginning to pile up dust - since the horrible taste of her Christmas Album hasn't really gotten out of my mouth yet, I really haven't had the hankering to play any of her other `stuff'.  Well, enough about Ms. Mann, and on to the better Christmas Records.  Well, not even the better Christmas CD's were getting even close to tossing me up into the Sky as Annie Lennox's Christmas Cornucopia had been doing.  So, no, it is not just Christmas, it is Annie Lennox's Artistic Vision of Christmas, and her willingness and ability to take on that Mystical and Enraptured Persona that could effectively drive it all Home.  Oh, and there is in a number of songs the appearance of the South African Children's Choir, or as many of them as she could fly to London for the recording sessions - wonderfully talented and obviously very well disciplined, as the material given to these kids could not have possibly been wrapped up in one `take' and more and more must have been demanded of them, and they marched on like little troupers and delivered the absolute best.<br /><br />As far as Annie Lennox goes, after they completed this Project, I simply do not understand how she could possibly NOT have exploded into a Flash of Absolute White Light that would have certainly Illuminated the entire Planet to bring us all to our better senses.  But maybe it just needs a bit more time.  Anyway it will probably help to buy one for yourself, and then get one for a friend.  Perhaps we all have to first Hear the Vision before we can See the Vision.
030758836X|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, it was intriging from beginning to end. Although I would have liked for the end to be different, it is still as haunting as the book itself. The author does a great job of developing characters which I'm not going to describe to you as to NOT give anything away. I highly recommend it!
0451197879|3.0|Never finished reading this book, I USUALLY DEVOUR MY STEPHEN KING books, but this one didn't draw me in for some reason.
0374214913|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It has some mystery, tech-savvy young adults, google employees, and a lot of fun. It takes place mainly in San Francisco and New York and I won't give anything else away.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is a wonderful, holiday movie with such a clever storyline. I watch it every year and enjoy it like it was my first viewing. Proving someone is the real Santa is a great storyline and I highly recommend it.
0525478817|5.0|This book was amazingly beautiful and sad. If you only read one book this year it must be this one. It moved me deeply. In fact I have not been so moved by a book ever since Dumbledore died in HP6.
B00008F438|5.0|my dad was loooking for this tape for along time'' so gald you had it' he said this tape played like new
0307887448|5.0|This book was a blast to read! There is so much fun and action within that you'll keep turning the pages. It will bring a lot of memories for those of us that grew up in the 80s and 90s, although it focuses mostly on the 80s video games, music and movies. Awesome!
B005LAII1C|5.0|I saw this twice in the theaters, which for me is extremely rare. Let's put it this way. I've never done that.  I rarely buy movies. I usually rent from netflix but this was worth buying. Highly recommended if you have a sense of humor!
0375701427|3.0|Roth is an exceptionally talented writer. Like all good authors, he says things that express the readers deepest emotions. He gives his readers feelings a tongue. He has not failed in doing that here either. The story line, the narration was just top notch. Nothing like it. The ending however was just abrupt. It did not make sense and it did not complete the story telling as one would expect. I also found out this book was nominated as one of the 100 top books in american literature. While the book is great, its not that good.
B008RYN44U|4.0|Not their best stuff though I do like their two instant singles, Settle Down & Looking Hot. Yes I do purchase music for just one song. I haven't gone through the entire album yet but it's worth the money.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Clarkson at her finest! CD was in great shape and recieved much quicker than I expected. Quality seems awesome. So glad I went ahead and bought the whole CD. I found songs that I hadn't heard and now I love them!!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|This book was good, but moved much slower than the first one, probably could have edited out 200 pages and moved the story along better. But still a good book.  I look forward to the next book in the series.
B002NZK5TG|2.0|The case was smashed and - as far as I know - I didn't even order it! I accidentally got this broken CD in the mail.
B001HBYHFA|3.0|Chose this rating because too violent.<br /><br />Watched season one and so wanted to watch the movie. Some violence in the first season, but movie was overboard.<br /><br />Enjoyed the action and the finality and closure with Alliance.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game makes raising dragons so much FUN! Earth dragons, fire dragons, water dragons, air dragons, and so many more! Once you get an arena, you can even enter your dragons into competition to win coins and gems. The background music is perfect and I also love the animation. If you love fantasy, you'll love DragonVale!
B00993FEUK|5.0|Great animation and funny too. enjoyed the movie with my family and friends. Recommended for all the see and enjoy.
B000001FKY|5.0|My step brother is going to love these, they are going to go great in the new car he buys. Great packaging
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|The movie was a good movie, but I thought it started pretty slow. The first 30 minutes could have been better. All in all it was a good movie.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|My favorite movie growing up, its definitely a classic movie.I know she'll enjoy it . Great packaging, brand new movie
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|This is a very neat free app. It is free to encourage you to buy the other animals, about a buck or two?<br /><br />The kitty purrrs and yowls when you do stuff to it. Cat lovers will find this a fun thing and there are things you can do that I have not mentioned as it is fun to try different things on your own.
B007SGM084|1.0|i am seriously considering checking in for a bit- why would i pay money for that?  people kept saying it is a great story  there really was NO story just sex and talking about it not worth the time to read let alone the money to purchase
1451662432|5.0|I must say I am a huge fan or Arnold and therefore pre-ordered this book.<br />It took a while to finish it (it's not the kind of book u bring around due to its size) but I loved it.<br /><br />I was amazed by reading the story of a guy who accomplished in one lifetime, what normal people accomplish maybe in 2-3 lifetimes (if u believe in multiple lives..).<br />THE Bodybuilder<br />one of THE action heroes<br />THE Governator<br /><br />Speechless.<br />The only thing that I would criticize, is the last part about politics and his times as a governor.<br />I believe that Arnold's hardcore fans want to hear about his bodybuilding, movies and private life, way more than hearing about budget cuts. Moreover, all of us probably wanted to hear more details about Mildred and Joseph, not in a sense of \\"Let's hear some juicy gossip\\" but more about what drove him to behave like this, how did he feel, how does he feel now. This part was a little too vague in my opinion.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I would re-buy it and re-read it immediately if I had to go back.<br /><br />Source of inspiration. Stay hungry. Don't settle. Ignore the naysayers. Do something which was never done before. Work your ass off.
B000VPPMXO|1.0|I bought this to keep my Roomba out of the kitchen, is not compatable with my 500, I use virtual wall.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. I started watching it on Netflix and was happy to be able to purchase the shows I was missing between Netflix and what was currently on TV. Thank you Amazon!
B000FCKBCU|5.0|I Really enjoyed this book. It had an unbelievable story but was an inspiring story. I would definitely recommend it.
0061733199|5.0|This is by far the best book I've ever read love the print size and the survival scenarios and case studies are great.
B003VR5PPY|2.0|This game failed to immerse me in story or game play. I have to admit the story interested me to an extent but tediousness of slow text and mostly uninteresting/uninspired puzzles were the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I much prefer a game like Ghost Trick
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Here is what you can count on when it comes to a Ferris book. Facts galore. If you are an information junkie as I am, then every single one of his books you will enjoy. This chef book for me so far is quite basic, however it seems to me that most Americans need basic. But I simply love all the information he gives. I will always feel anticipation as to what he hacks next and his next book.<br /><br />*******Update***** this book is simply so much fun to read. The way he puts this book together is great with small bites of info here and there. Love it love it love it.
B00722ZHG6|5.0|This young girl is beautiful and talented. I love her work and look forward to buying more of it in the future!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put Gone Girl down for the first half - I literally had to pry the book out of my hands so that I could sleep!  I wasn't thrilled with the ending, though I suppose it made sense.  A good ride, nonetheless.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is ok. The bad thing about it is that the games are to easy and you cant get enough points to unlock new ones
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I think that Michael C. Hall does such a great job with a very complicated character.<br />Interesting script.<br />Can't be faint of heart in watching, but many times, cheering Dexter on as he deals with the &#34;garbage of society&#34;.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I never get tired of watching the Step Up movies!  I am a dancer, so I love to see what new dance styles will appear in the movies.  The dancing was awesome and the story line was very cute!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|One of the most useful apps I've downloaded. It's easy to use and has all the features you'd want in an alarm app. I rarely pay for things that I can get for free, but I intend on paying for the full version of this. I highly recommend.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Loved this movie!  Great quality through Amazon Instant Videos on my Roku.  It definitely made this 29 year old excited to have a family in the near future!  Hope that does not scare any couples away from watching it!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|If  you love Van, this is a keeper you will play over and over.  I was surprised at how much material is on this album.
B002QNBRXS|4.0|My family and I are big Dexter fans!  I could not wait for the next disc to arrive from Netflix so my boyfriend and I purchased an episode on Amazon on a Friday night.  The quality was good and the ease of access while sitting on our couch was quite appealing.  However, I wish the episodes were cheaper!
B0098VXE50|4.0|Well worth watching! Lots of great visuals and decent acting overall. Making of featurettse are also good. I definitely recommend it.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I initially heard Ellie Goulding on Saturday Nigh Live a year or more ago.  I was not initially impressed but gave her another chance several months later and have been in love with her music since!  This is a great new CD from Ellie!
B009GEN0JO|4.0|Though not officially part of the James Bond series, and even though it is a rough update of &#34;Thunderball&#34;, your 007 collection isn't complete without it. It is currently overpriced to buy on DVD or bluray, as it is out of circulation, but it was well priced to buy through Amazon for instant movies. I watched it in HD through my Xbox 360 on my big screen TV. It ran perfectly. I was happy to see this option as there is no way I was going to overpay for a physical copy. If the price comes back down, I would still buy one though to complete my Bond collection.
B009329Y30|5.0|Zac Efron is amazing in this movie!  This is a totally new character for him!  I enjoyed every minute of this movie!  The chemistry is great!
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read it because Will Smith spoke about how it influenced his life. The take away for me is to follow your heart.
B0052QXAEK|5.0|I am a sucker for a good love story!  My boyfriend teases me because of the sappy movies that I choose!  I love them!  This is a good movie!  I have watched it several times!
1936850028|5.0|This book is a heroic story of personal growth and a beautiful mosaic of the human spirit. The author's ambition through adversity is intoxicating. He really puts everything into perspective. This memoir is perfect for those striving for their best whether in business, athletics, or life. I can't go wrong giving this book to anyone.<br /><br />I enjoyed the genius of Rhein's writing style. He gives a totally honest account of his experiences. I really enjoyed this raw footage. It was an absolute pleasure to read. He also writes with exquisite scene depiction. I just had to see what was going to happen next! His suspense actually created an adrenaline rush for me!<br /><br />I also enjoyed the high on life emotions this book brought out. I laughed extensively throughout the entire memoir. In the midst of adversity, Rhein puts a hilarious and positive spin on everything. What a way to go through life! What a great perspective! I enjoyed every minute of it. This will be a book I'll be reading over again!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show and season 3 is no exception. You won't be disappointed watching this. I finish one episode and have to watch the next.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Amazing sound quality, good design, comfortable fit, pretty long battery life, nice range (can walk anywhere in the apartment without losing signal)
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The product came damaged. It is still usable however it was disappointing to receive damaged because it is a gift for someone so I now have to give them a damaged gift
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really like this game. It hardly ever freezes up. If you like Oregon Settler, you will like this game.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|As usual, the supporting characters elevated the movie beyond entertainment and into art.  The Barbie and Ken storyline is an absolute delight to watch, and little Bonnie was the perfect complement to Andy's young adult.  Was surprised at how emotionally wrenching and bittersweet this movie was, but loved the experience.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I got this game and thought it was going to be cheezy but it was pretty fun. The game crashed my phone from time to time but other than that, its a good game to have.
B007PVHAN2|5.0|So far the tablet has been really fun along with helpfull. I origanly got it so that my wife could access etc. That takes away the time we spend together. Our Fun is all the way of the house. Often I found it isolated. This smart thing has allowed us along with myself less restricted or confined to the back on wich it displays me. I have never even manipulated a befor. I always thought they were very limited and could not perform the average tasks. However I have been proven wrong. Surfing !!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another home run from Flynn !! A terrific author who keeps you on the edge of your seat !! A winner!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|She might get sick of it soon, but for the 5 days we've had she has been very happy with it, and can play it without supervision or help, which is really nice!
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I don't understand how in the world anyone can find this book good. This is the biggest load of crap I have read since 50 Shades. Whoever said these sex scenes are \\"hot\\" deserves to be slapped in the face! You can tell this book was self published with little to no editing. Note to author- shell out the money for a proper editor if you are going to self publish. The over all writing style was atrocious, the plot went nowhere and the characters were one dimensional and had no growth whatsoever. Abysmal piece of work
B005HSL626|4.0|Quick, variety of modes and difficulty, and easy understand. My only complaint would be that there should be more 'Sensei's Swag'.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is fun!  Not a lot of thought required, so even my 3 yr old granddaughter can play. We both have fun winning the prizes.
0345803485|5.0|I Love this trilogy...  Cant wait for maybe a movie to come out. Although it will have to be rated XXX ;)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the  best app I've downloaded .<br />It's everything I need in one app. I can even pick up the notes from my Church if I missed.  I would  recommend this to everyone.
0375507256|5.0|This is a superb volume, and the best presentation yet of author David Mitchell's extraordinary skill and flexible voice. One of the amazing things this book project accomplishes is to blur the division between a collection of stories and a novel.  There are six stories, linked through threads that are in some cases rather minor, in others critical, but together they make a unified whole with a consistent theme.  Some of the reviewers here seem to miss it: The key to the future of mankind is the little things that we do to each other, for each other, or forebear to doing to each other. I can't see that this is a minor, shallow, or missing theme at all; instead it is one that we should keep in our minds and hearts, as I do the various stories presented here and their images, now captured memorably in film.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I enjoyed this series and this does not disappoint. Be sure and read the first book first - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - This book is suspenseful and fun. Kindle version is ideal.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book really sailed and was a fun and suspenseful conclusion to the series. Be sure and read the other two first, and in order.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Although I'm new follower to Reached, I am now a real fan. Hope to read all Mr. Child's books.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places was gruesome, but I couldn't stop reading, so I guess I liked it....Ms Flynn has a dark imagination
B004EPYZUS|5.0|these dvds are never boring.I own all of the mission impossibles and they are the best movies. I would recommed these to anybody.
B0076DELIG|5.0|It is really hard to beat a Michael Connelly novel, especially a Harry Bosch story. I  thought the book was great from start to finish and kept me reading  late into the night.<br />If you liked the other Harry Bosch books,then you will really enjoy this one. Connelly<br />Has a way  of really bringing Harry to life with all his quirky ways.
0345529057|5.0|are these four books complete \\"Game Of Thrones\\" story? and which of them are according to HBO's 1st and 2nd seasons?
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I have nothing to say. It was something to watch on a night when there was nothng else to watch.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|it is a good movie , but there are a lot of question marks . It does not follow a sequence and end it blahhh !! . Artistic wise it is a  good graphic movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have  read multiple times shortest three days Susanne Collins is an author who uses great detail and likes to finish the story with a bang
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I have an old bose sound dock that I could only use with one very old ipod. The sound dock works and sounds great, but I couldn't connect anything else to it.  The cable works exactly as I had hoped -- while it doesn't charge the devices, I am now able to use the sound dock to listen to music from my iphone, newer ipods and laptop.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Fascinating I would definitely recommend it to SciFi lovers.  I liked the concept.  Howey writes very well and sure keeps you engaged.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works just like the website. Love it. It's easy to use and downloaded quickly. I'm glad the Kindle Fire has these options
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|This app is the BEST on my Galaxy S 4g. On my (original) Kindle Fire I can't even use the damn thing. The manufacturer needs to fix it if I can EVER use it on my Fire. It force closes after about 30 seconds. I use CineX player instead.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is a great album. I absolutely love all of the songs on it. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|neat little game. standard time management with a twist. my 3 year old loves it. only complaint is the amount of stuff that costs real money. tough to explain to the 3 year old she cant feed the Kitty cupcakes :)
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies ever made.  For those of you who have not seen it, don't cheat yourselves!  What an amazing story!  One of my all time favorites!
B001B2CPH2|5.0|A great love story with a little humor added in with Whoopie Goldberg's performance.  This will become a classic yet.
B00081U7HC|5.0|This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again!  Julia Roberts was a perfect choice for the female lead!  A classic!
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Will Smith's performance in this true story is amazing!  And with his real life son playing his son, you see his real emotions coming out.  I will never get tired of watching this movie.
0385535139|3.0|I have always been a Grisham fan, but this one was a little too predictable.  I'm sure I'll continue to read Grisham, but hope that they will go back to the constant element of the &#34;what next.&#34;
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love how Pixar always presents a moral with every story.  (With a lot of hidden adult innuendos!). What a great story!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|There is so much that happens in this book.  If you have not started this series, you best get busy!  I hate that book six is not out yet!  The wait is going to make me crazy!
B000957O82|5.0|This is another outstanding performance by Will Smith.  This is one that I will watch again and again!  A definite feel good movie!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It's a hard topic to read (slavery), but a book that is well written.  I loved the characters and how they keep it together against all odds.  I really enjoyed this one!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great read.  Mr Isaacson takes you through the development of an American visionary, warts & all.  One of my favorite biographies
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Why \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is a good movie.<br /><br />The film not only houses the familiar characters of the previous two films but also reunites a number of \\"Inception\\" actors which happens to be my favorite Christopher Nolan film. The story has a familiar feel to it, full of action - villain vs. hero, but it was surrounded by such a huge group of superb actors that it was meant to succeed. With the addition of Anne Hathaway as the cat woman (though not directly referred to in the film), Tom Hardy who so valiantly plays the villain (or is he?), Marion Cotillard who is so mesmerizing and Joseph Gordon-Levitt it breathed new life into what could have been a so-so conclusion to a trilogy of crime fighting.<br /><br />Nearly three hours in length I found it neither slow, boring nor over the top as some comic book hero movies can be. The story gives us a dose of history, some truth from the two previous films and what seems to be an offering of the future. \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" lives up to the tall dark figure looming atop the tallest buildings of Gotham and brings home something worth watching at least once.
0937381888|5.0|This is my guide for homebrewing.  I read Papazian's book (which I also own and recommend) but this book is best for using on brew day to review all the steps prior to getting started.  For the more advanced brewer, it also goes through each step in detail - including all-grain brewing, and also has tons of information about chemistry and building your own equipment.  Highly recommend!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Not a t.v. person, read the books first and loved them. I was happy to find Dexter true to character.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man<br />Excellent action packed thriller!  Well written - a real page turner --- keeps your interest right to the end.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the sequels. The book was very descriptively written! It held my interest and kept me on the edge of my seat!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love all the different creatures and animals. This is way better then block story. Its a good game for every one
B009738XXM|4.0|I really like the fun, catchy songs on this cd! Some of the songs sound similar though, but it is still a good cd!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf is Excellent!  My daughter will be thrilled, she wore out her copy.  Can't believe how quickly it arrived!  Great price too!
B004YJZBCK|5.0|A stellar follow-up to Bad Company's debut album, Straight Shooter is filled with more excellent classic rock 'n' roll.  I purchased the Audio Fidelity gold CD of this album, and the sound quality lives up to the music.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I have read this book at least three times.  Any time I read it I learn something new. Dr. Peck is brilliant! I recommend this book to everyone especially to those who are going through difficult times in their lives.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|very well done series that has lots of twists and turns.  It seems more like a bigger budget movie than a television show
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game! If they gave more energy to use without trying to con you into buying more with real money, then it would be five stars..
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Very great viewing quality and great movie! Great support to help you do it if you've never used it before.
1401322786|5.0|This is my favorite book of the year! This book is like an adult bedtime story and gives the reader a big hug at the end. This story is about a man who created the first man made time measuring devices and how he learned the lesson that the quality of time and the people you love are more important than the quantity of time.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, you learn about the lives of three main characters. Nor, who is the first man to measure time, is punished by god and becomes the &#34;Timekeeper&#34;, a lovesick teenage girl who tries to commit suicide after a boy rejects her love, and an extremely wealthy old man who is dying and wants to cheat death. These three characters destiny's are intertwined, and this story teaches the characters and the reader sweet and true lessons about time, life, and death.<br /><br />This book is a perfect gift for yourself, a young adult, someone who is facing an illness, or anyone who needs to be reminded that life is not about punching a time clock, and that life is meant to be shared and cherished with the ones we love.
B004U8VWIM|3.0|So much potential, too little delivery.  t takes entirely too long to write a separate, thoughtful review for each movie watched, and each product purchased.  if I'm going to be a critic, I want to get paid.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|Half assed story, at best.  t takes entirely too long to write a separate, thoughtful review for each movie watched, and each product purchased.  if I'm going to be a critic, I want to get paid.
B003NVN1C2|5.0|This movie shows how man can descend into survival mode. I think you may take something extra from this movie if you are like me and believe in preparing for a natural disaster.
B002LMV7TS|4.0|I find Jim Carrey's rendition of the Grinch to be hilarious. The script is a little dry in places, but any scene the Grinch is in is a winner, and the rest of the movie is so visually pleasing that it makes up for the occasional lack of humor.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My four year old loves it free app of the day would have paid full price highly recommend for all children
B007Y2W44W|5.0|First time I heard this album I was hooked! I really enjoyed listening to it while I worked on my crafts!
B0094RCD14|5.0|We all say that we have a favorite song or album, but I can honestly say that Massive Attack ,Blue Lines is my #1 alubum and music!!! I have replaced my CD 5 times since the birth of trip hop. Given it as gifts. I own all their music and videos! A++++++++<br />Thanks Massive Attack, I just hope I can fly across the pond and see you live someday.<br />Sincerely , Greg
B00003CX5P|1.0|It's stylistically designed to be that way, and you can't undo that, but you can diminish the effects of it.
B004SIP6ZE|3.0|With this film I saw something hard and works well but only the first disc the second disc has all the material can be completely reader my DVD drive does not load the game that has no pictures of the story board
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Well done, believable, interesting. Download it and read it now! Hey, this book is only $.99 and worth much more.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|I understand they are making a movie of this one.  Since movies usually mess up a good book, it will be interesting to see if maybe a movie might improve this one.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a way to challenge your mind into improving thinking ahead, and all with fun.<br />It seems easy at first but it gets more and more difficult as you progress through the more difficult levels. Worth the time too.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|A very interesting book about feudal Japan, the characters  were believable, and the writing excellent with twists and turns in the plot.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This has to be one of the best series out there. Not for kids and kind of gross but GREAT stories and plot lines.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|A great end to the tv series. Found I had gotten emotionally involved with the characters and didn't want it to end...
B009VB7QQA|1.0|Not sure why they even bothered. Most movies aren't like the books, but this was a disaster and a waste of money. Thankfully I had only rented it!
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I enjoyed it thoroughly but I am not sure why! Try it and see. The author certainly has a fertile imagination.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|After watchnig Downton  season one on Netflix we became addicted! With no season two offered I HAD to purchase it! We have watched it several times and seem to get more and more out of it as we do. The costumes, setting, plot and acting are outstanding and I highly recommend this to anyone who is in for good entertainment! Season three is on preorder and will come Jan 29th to my doorstep!
1409136612|3.0|I liked the story.  However, did not realize it was such a short story.  Still, as it was probably Maeve Binchy's final book all is forgiven.  What wonderful stories she has brought us over the years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is sooooooooo addicting!  The games are creative and high quality.  Challenging and fun and perfect for anyone who has a few hours to kill.
0399157565|3.0|I have read just about all of Patricia Cornwell's book and found this one very hard to get into, not one of her best novels
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think this game is fun, it can get very addicting. This game gives you the ability to win cool prizes and earn more coins which helps you complete the game
B000LBBLO2|2.0|Read the description of the dvd set and got excited about the radio broadcast disc that was advertised so I ordered it.When I received the product there was no dvd it didn't have the radio dvd.Needlesss to say I was disappointed and won't be ordering from the seller again
B000QCQ9O8|4.0|Ian McEwan manipulates the modern narrative into a cleverly unravelling story of love, lies, and regret. The protagonist is believable and complex.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Great casting, great story, awesome action.  One of the best super hero movies I've seen in a while.  I will watch it again and again.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|he has such a soothing voice that i can't help but enjoy just listening to him and the calmness he has. i can't get enough of his voice i love it that much!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I read all of the reviews and played it myself. Graphics wise this version is fairly identical to its pc counterpart, the inventory of blocks and items on creative is limited. The controls are a bit clunky and difficult,  and total build (map)  size is small. It too me a few minutes to figure out how to get off the ground. Overall for the quality you are better saving yourself $7.00 and stick to the pc version.
B003QCCS36|5.0|he has such a soothing voice that i can't help but enjoy just listening to him and the calmness he has. this seems to be a little more upbeat but i like the mingling of the voices.
B00785P2QC|1.0|really cant even down load this stupid app onto my kindle fire rediculuse<br />don't even try this app if you cant even download
B00018D44U|5.0|She is so incredibly calming to listen to! i could just sit and listen to her all day and all night.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book was entertaining, I didn't want to put it down. Anyone might find it fun, young or old :)
B004XE0P5E|5.0|he is the 1 that got me into this genre of music of &#34;relaxing&#34; singing voices and i shall not forget that. i now have a playlist of &#34;calm songs&#34; on my ipod because of him.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Love this Movie... The dance moves are sensational!! and it has a cute little story line to it... Channing Tatum is a BEAST when he dances!
B0002S947K|5.0|his voice is 1 of a kind. its as if he is singing straight to you through his songs. highly recommend.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I have seen all of the MIB movies and this was the only one that I steamed to my TV via my Roku.  No jitters, dead spots, stoppage, etc. A great viewing experience and a great movie.
0439023521|5.0|I wasn't in on all the initial excitement of these books or the movie, but once I cracked the first page I could not put this book down!  I was reading until 2 AM each night just to find out what happened.
B008JAGG38|3.0|If you know the series you know what to expect. Turn your brain off for 90 minutes and enjoy. It is mindless crude humor but like I said it is part of the American Pie series so what do you expect.
B004QO9WVO|1.0|I choose this rating because I wanted to download an audio version to try it out.<br />I spent hours trying to get my audio version on my kindel. Never again will I do that<br />again. I never recieved the audio version. To much of a hassel to even complain.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|George Clooney does not disappoint playing a wealthy family man who's family is falling apart over some key real estate in Hawaii that has to be sold. A twist in the plot makes him start wondering what is really important. Watch it and see what unfolds from there.
B004U8VWIM|2.0|Surprised that this got so much critical acclaim. It was a struggle to keep watching it. Could not identify with any of the pathetic characters.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I tried the first book in the series for free because I wasn't sure if I would like it or not.  But when I read the last sentence of the first book I knew that I had to have the rest.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Sound quality is fine for games but it lacking for music & sounds HORRIBLE until you tune it with the EQ.<br /><br />Directional sound is spot on for my ears & I can really hear people creeping up on my in BF3 & tell where things are in Minecraft.<br /><br />Battery life for me only lasts about 6-8 hours.<br /><br />Range is great & I get good signal almost everywhere in my 2 story house.<br /><br />On a side note, the headset has some major software issues. The battery life remaining is constantly changing & is never very accurate in the software. When you lose signal from lack of range it resets your mute on the mic until you mute it again. after a break from using it you have to flick the switch from surround to stereo & back again to get surround to work properly, and from time to time I have to unplug the usb adapter & plug it back in for it to work properly.<br /><br />Also: not really a con or pro, but personal preference, the volume roller on the headset adjusts SUPER slowly... I have to scroll it repeatedly just to notice a difference in volume.
B000T45C32|5.0|Chose this flick to write my philosophy paper on- Ethics! Well worth it! Acting was phenomenal and I would recommend it!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Very well written and the effects were great. Better than MIB 2. Josh Brolan did a great Tommy Lee Jones.
B008N1V11U|4.0|Great graphics,good control and fun gameplay. This game and the amazing spiderman are the two best games I have played on the kindle fire hd. I'll be looking out for gamelofts titles for now on.
0140544518|4.0|This book is so cute. I used to read it to my Pre-K kids at work and they loved it. They wanted to read it every day and they even memorized the words.
B0007TKNKG|3.0|My boyfriend came across this movie while looking up old movies on Amazon. When I ordered it, I didn't remember much about it. It sure brings back a lot of memories once you start watching it!
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I love all the Rocky movies so I had to buy this one. It's really interesting and had a lot of great quotes in it but I was just disappointed b/c I wanted to see more boxing but I knew it wouldn't have much since it is the last one & he's supposed to be retired.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|The new cd is great! Deftones are one of my favorite bands. I saw them the day after the cd came out in Dallas, TX.
B007SUW24W|5.0|There literally isn't one bad thing to say about this album. It's beautiful. This man has a beautiful soul and deserves a listen.
B004259BMM|5.0|I have been to two of his concerts, and Keith Urban is a great performer. I love this CD, it's great!
B009FO908A|3.0|It's so cheesy that I can hardly stand how much I secretly adore the song. It isn't the best on the album though.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Not to be taken too seriously but a lot of fun  to watch with a lot of action. The special effects were very good and the acting was not too bad. Wonder what my dad the WW2  navy vet would have thought.
B005DWA5KK|4.0|If you love old school horror, this is definitely the movie to watch. I consider it to be one of the greatest horror films of all time. It's executed flawlessly for its time. The sets are beautiful and definitely sell the intensely eerie tone. The only issue I have with this version (and I actually consider it a huge issue) is that Giuseppe Becce score isn't used in this version. The score in this version doesn't quite set the tone as well as Giuseppe Becce's.<br /><br />I bought it for a Christmas gift though, so whatever. It's still worth giving a watch.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Fun to watch. The actor who played the younger K was great and had me thinking this was the young Tomy Lee.<br />The bad guy of the movie was entertaining and I hope they bring him back somehow in a future movie.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|Plain and simple, do not buy if you have a Xoom. Game crashes and locks up every few minutes. Needs a fix.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|Used to read these Marvel comics as a kid and the Iron Man movies are a great trip back in time and are a lot of fun to watch. Downey fits the role well. Special effects are very good, lots of action and an easy to understand plot.<br />What fun.
B00280LYHS|5.0|love all of his novels. m m m m m m / / / / / /  . . .
B009OYSFDM|4.0|This series is surprisingly good. Wasn't sure when I first started looking at it but then I realized that it had a lot of similarities to Batman. I like Batman. Especially the Christian Bale version.<br /><br />Stephen Amell almost seemed too young for this role, but as it turns out is very impressive as a superhero. Has all the brooding, drive, imagination and past personal flaws I would expect for a superhero to have. His movements are impressive to watch and he has family and  friends around him to help him mature and maintain some equilibrium in his life. After just a few episodes I am concerned about where the book of names will lead us. And what more we will discover after we get there. The origins of his powers and his mother's role in all of this are starting to reveal itself. The new character also is interesting and will most likely be a new villain. I am looking forward to what comes next!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love all of his stories. Who doesn't want more and more of Percy, Annabeth and company.  / / / / /
B004G8QHKO|5.0|Before buying this, I had never actually owned a music album. Granted, I had a couple songs of various bands on my phone and on itunes here and there, but never a cd with a full album from one band. I have to say, as the first album I've ever owned, I'm really glad it's this one.<br /><br />I was, however, already a fan of tnaf, mainly for their awesome singles that I've discovered over the internet or heard in video games. I enjoy listening to \\"All of This\\", \\"Girls Like You\\", and \\"Spank\\", and \\"Punching in a Dream\\" is a song that no matter how many you listen to it, it only gets better and better. As for \\"Young Blood\\"...well, I need to say this: as I grow up, I'll always have new favorite songs, but over time I will, no matter what, say, 'yeah, THIS song is my favorite song right now, but \\"Young Blood\\" will forever be my favorite song, of ALL TIME.\\" Personally, it's that incredible of a song, and if you haven't heard it yet I suggest you search Youtube for a lyric video of \\"Young Blood\\" right away.<br /><br />That being said, I also suggest you listen to the rest of the songs on the album somewhere as well. While the five songs I mentioned above already make the $10 cd absolutely worth it, there are other songs, like \\"Frayed\\" or \\"A Wolf in Geek's Clothing\\", that might not fancy everyone, and some of the songs are actually quite short. \\"The Source\\", which serves as an intro for \\"The Sun\\", is only 45 seconds long.<br /><br />It's rather obvious that myself not only having bought the album but also loving The Naked and Famous that I would recommend this album to you or anyone else on Amazon. I will say that I hope that you'll check out some of the band's songs and consider this incredibly fantastic album.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|This is a great CD. I love every song on the CD. It has a very relaxing and smooth vibe.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|It's different than anything that's played on the radio, but in the sense that listening to the album's tracks make you wonder 'Why have I never I heard THIS over the radio?'<br />And t's not just \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" that makes Foster the People great. Personally I enjoy listening to all of the songs on the album, and none of the songs sound like discardable inserts. Every song contributes to the album.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I have not had much time to corrolate a thesis for this game since i have succumbed to its addictiveness and now spend every hour consumed by my virtual and ficticious dominion.  I will say the game is exhilerating and extremely enhances the entertainment levels to fulfill the needs of one such as I.  Overall this virtual simulation has stimulated my sense of &quot;fun&quot; and i have come to the conclusion that many people will come to find this game the addiction of a period of time no less than three weeks.
B005LAII08|5.0|Absolutely love this movie...especially being of celtic decent<br /> The music makes the movie. Great to see it isn't the traditional princess...wish I had a daughter to watch it with.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|The video was sold as NEW but had no plastic seal and seemed to have been opened! DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED SINCE IT WAS A GIFT!
B001QC9PSO|5.0|The best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie for sure! I need to just buy this one for my collection. :)
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Mark Harmon is awesome. Rest of cast fits well.<br />Writers - keep on going.  Looking for more in<br />future episodes.
B001O03NCW|5.0|If you enjoyed the music from the movie, well, here it is. The great advantage is to get the complete song of course, not the truncated song in the movie.
B000002GC2|5.0|I have always loved &#34;The Dude&#34; when it first came out and had to have the CD personally.  This is by far the best album/CD ever made.
B009YJEKJK|1.0|So, my wife collects Christmas CDs and compiles her own as gifts.  This looked interesting, and thought it might be fun to cehck in with icons of my 1970's youth.  Started with the available samples and...ugh!<br /><br />Their voices are just...bad.  Travolta was never really a vocal talent, and she was brittle.  Their voices are shot, and the brief snippets of the arrangements are AWFUL as far as production, phrasing and tone.  Someone mentioned 'mailing it in,' and that sounds right for this effort.  Sadly, their time has passed.  I'm guessing they would faint with a visit from just the Spirit of Christmas Past.<br /><br />Charity or not, this appears to be UNLISTENABLE.  Save your money for the Salvation Army bellringers.  They at least earn it by doing some real work, and some even sing better.
B009NW9QE2|5.0|Must watch for us every Christmas-time, though it would be equally good any time of year! The Holiday has a teriffic cast, great music, sweet story lines and a smile on your face each time you watch it!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Quite easily the best adaption I have seen; and I have watched it many times now. This particular adaption lasts over four episodes. The characters are excellently cast and although the entirety of Charlotte Bronte's novel is not depicted, a first timer to Jane Eyre would not notice as each scene flows smoothly. The mini series is accompanied by haunting music, setting the viewer up for the intrigue and forbidden romance.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|I recommend it. It is a great movie for kids, for family time.  I downloaded on my kindle, its easy for my kids to watch it.
B0098VYKSA|1.0|It was beyond predictable and the actress who played Snow White was dismal.  She was stone faced, emotionless, seemed to go through the motions, and completely unbelievable to the point she overcast everyone else.  My twelve year old triplets and I did not enjoy this movie.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses there is not one move that I don't enjoy of hers, this one does not disappoint at all!!
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|This movie was okay. The storyline was a bit slow. Overall, it was good. I think it just wasn't my type of movie. The actors did a good job!
0385738765|4.0|This book is alright. Great for a young boy/teenager who likes to read. In my opinion, the first book was better.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works great. I use it every day &amp; haven't had any problems. Good for every day use and especially when traveling.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|My sister & I watch this, together, every holiday season.  It's a great chick flick.  We love it!  5 stars!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|We've seen ParaNorman at the drive-in, in 3D at the theater, and now the kids have watched it two more times through Amazon Instant rental.  Very cute show!
B004UID2LC|4.0|I was unable to watch youtube videos on my Kindle Fire before this app.  I'm very happy with the app.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. I now need to see the movie but am sure it will not compare to how good the book was!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Maybe a little long but worth it. Great special effects and cinematography. The way it tied everything together was good.
B004I1K2NW|4.0|My hubby loves this movie and now with a teenager in the house.  He was able to share his favorite movie with her.  It even came in Blu Ray.....
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|good game<br /> fun tile based matching game with lots of bonuses to help you get the needed tiles to the bottom
B0059IVV9M|5.0|By far their best job according to my opinion you have to buy it if you are a Beirut fun!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have all the Mitch Rapp series.<br />This one seems a little more disjointed, but a good read.<br /><br />I collect several authors.
B000UJ48XG|4.0|I can't find much more words to describe their acoustics! So smooth and easy hearing especially at long lasting trips!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Seems fun and addicting but I deleted the app after two glitches in which several items and coins disappeared and never returned.
B000F5GO0A|4.0|Nice job but I can't say that it's one of the best from their albums although as a decent fun of them I have already bought it!
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|This is a very well done animated Advent calendar countdown.  I even find my two children going back and re-doing previous days.  i think the graphics are very nice but I just can't figure out why something this nice doesn't have ANY sound.  i did email the developers of this app and I was told that sound is coming in a few days....that was approximately three days ago.  Every day the kids open up a new window, I'm waiting to hear something.  It is however well worth the 99 cents.<br /><br />Update 12/10/12...the sound has arrived!!  It does make the countdown calendar a lot nicer.
B000W93CHC|4.0|This book is very similar in a lot of ways to Pillars of the Earth.  Many of the same story lines and plots.  It is a very long book but the author keeps you interested enough that you want to continue.  Very well written and easy to digest but I was a little disapointed with the ending.  I guess it leads in to the next book somehow but I think I will wait a while to read that one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love both the movie and book it's the best book that a young teen or adult will enjoy reading.
0345529057|2.0|Love this series of books.  The books starting losing pages out of the books as soon as I turned the first page.  This happened with all four books.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Here again, I love bingo games.  This is a very pleasant game to pass the time.  I usually play it every day.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was mesmerizing.  I didn't want to put it down.  I loved the poetic, artistic descriptions. A must read for everyone who believes in magic and love!
B009CPES4I|5.0|Great movie with an amazing cast that really pulls you in.  We loved the setting so very much.  Great moving for aging beautiful people!
1439190275|5.0|this book is the newest version of the Atkins diet. I like all of the new information that is published in this book about the diet itself
B00722Y1EK|5.0|UPDATE, Feb 19, 2014: Beware of the Xposed Framework module within a recent update of Cool Tool, to be activated if you have the Xposed Framework installed.  After I activated the module, my phone had difficulties booting and the settings for a multitude of programs got corrupted.  At the same time, the module brought no benefits of any sort on my phone.  I spent hours getting my phone working again and the problems with booting and corruption were repeatable, i.e. not some random fluke.  I suggest never activating the Xposed module.<br /><br />Cool Tool allows for an immediate insight into the current workings of an Android device.  Using the Hack option, the information may even appear on the lockscreen, albeit at the cost of losing touchscreen capabilities then.  The extensive customization menus allow for a selection of the information of current concern and for placing that information on screen in an unobstructive manner even when overlaid on displays of other applications.  Area, location, font size, color, opaqueness, all can be independently adjusted.  Annoying in the settings are sliding scale adjusters that jump when one touches the display to move from one screen to another.  Selected information can include the process that consumes most CPU, battery temp, available RAM, network activity, etc.  The app is highly recommended for identifying existing problems and guarding against new ones.
B005EHNMWM|5.0|What a GREAT ALBUM! This band is great and this album is one of their best for sure. My favorite.
1401322786|5.0|I must confess, I should have read the fly leaf before I started. At first the author's movement of characters through time and space confused me. But Albom does a masterful job that keeps you turning the pages to find out how life and death issues of each of the characters will be resolved. Can't write too much without giving away the ending. It's an enjoyable quick read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Shirley Brosius, author of Sisterhood of Faith and co-author of Turning Guilt Trips into Joy Rides.
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|It is a great movie. Brandon Lee will be severely missed.  He died too young and too early, as did his father Bruce Lee.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Saw the movie.  I have teenage trumpet students who kept telling me I needed to read the book.  I read all three in the series and they were right. I hope they don't try to talk me into reading the Harry Potter books!
B004VD3YIM|4.0|I use this for my Foscam and its used as a baby monitor. We needed the app to use on my Kindle to watch our son when he's napping or gone to bed but on the Kindle, it does freeze very often, that part is very annoying. But other than that, it's a pretty neat app. You can view so many webcams from all over the country, thats pretty cool.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I would have expected better from Ridley Scott. Poor story and what was there did not flow well. The special effects were relatively good though
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I absolutely love this album! I admit, I have been a Carrie Underwood fan since the very beginning, so I may be biased but the album really is great! It just seems like she keeps getting better and better. Just when you think she's at her very best, she blows you away with something else. I love almost every song on this album, it's hard to pick a favorite but the top 3 for me is: Who Are You, Blown Away and Two Black Cadillacs. I am so glad she decided to make Two Black Cadillacs a single, its so catchy and her singing this live is awesome!!!
B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|My swim coach requested we get this particular snorkel.  It takes a short time to get used to but I had to put tape on it for doing tumble turns as it slipped out of place.
B0017QDH3S|4.0|Jumper is enjoyable hardcore science fiction. Fast paced, lots of scenery, realistic dialog and a balanced amount of romance and violence. While teenagers is its target audience, as a senior citizen I liked it, too.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|This program takes up way too much room and then it doesn't work.  My 6 year old that paid for it with his own money said &#34;I just wasted a dollar on that game&#34;  so don't waste your time downloading it.
B0091LS07E|5.0|i haven't received the cd yet but i have listened to the mp3 tracks and i can't wait to receive it. this is definitely one of the best music releases of the year. this is  also one of the best cds alicia keys has ever done. i really liked when alicia sang fallin' on her 2001 cd songs in a minor and the music on girl on fire reminds me of the songs she started out singing. my favorite songs on the cd are &#34;girl on fire&#34;,&#34;thats when i knew&#34;, and &#34;tears always win&#34;. i bought this cd as a christmas gift for myself and i know i'm going to love it. i have always loved alicia key's music and this is definitely some of her best.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Taking the grandkids on the Polar Express in Bryson City, NC for Christmas. They love this movie. Great animation. k
6304712499|1.0|I ordered this movie for my husband for a surprise. He has searched for this movie for a long time and never found it. I ended up  finding it here and was very excited to order it. It took weeks..... I think 7 weeks for it to arrive... we opened it and it was scratched all over on both sides of the dvd. Not a happy customer.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|I had read reviews calling this album Fagan's best since the Steely Dan days and those reviews drove me to buy this record.  I found that it was just &#34;ok&#34; and nothing close to his early solo work on The Nightfly.  If you love The Nightfly, keep listening to it, but don't expect this album to move the ball forward.
B0013ND30W|3.0|i ordered this item for my gf for christmas and it says blu ray dvd combo i only recieved the blu ray movie not the other 2 disc
B0090EJ99A|3.0|This is a funny movie that relies on a few running gags and stereotypes for its humor.  This is not Sasha Baron Cohen's funniest by a long shot, but for a scripted film with actual characters it is a middle of the road comedy.  Many of the jokes are funny, a few are groaners.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Star Wars and Angry Birds mixed together is just crazy! I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and I didn't have to wait long. Graphics are more enhanced and everyone in the family can enjoy it. I'm not actually I big fan of Angry Birds but I tried this one out of curiosity. It was fairly easy at first, but every level gets more challenging than the previous and that's why you just can't put it down! For less than 5 bucks, I finally downloaded a game that's worth keeping in my Kindle. I haven't gotten the ultimate lightsaber yet since I really have to put my kindle down and start working. I hope they make a sequel for this because I will definitely buy it! I recommend this game for those who are bored and currently looking for a new past time. You will find yourself occupied for hours after downloading it.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I just received this Bluray and the outer package is very beautiful, the moving image is a clever idea and I didn't expect it since you can't appreciate it in the photos posted here. The CDs also have beautiful covers and of course the video quality is excellent. I love the &#34;Season play&#34; feature and all the bonus features.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Had I not read the book first I might have enjoyed the movie a bit more.  Except for the protagonist character development was sadly deficient.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|My progress through this story has been impacted by a Kindle & internet problem, but so far I'm hooked!  (The problem has been fixed --- three cheers Amazon rep!!!!)
B009VB97EY|1.0|Disappointed in this one, especially after all of the hype.  The language used was distracting and distasteful.  Storyline was almost absent. It was so bad we could not watch the entire movie.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Absolutely hilarious and very sweet movie. It is my new favorite Christmas movie. My teen and my parents all loved it.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|August Rush conveys a goodness we want to see more of in the world. Music wraps the story in light and keeps the plot moving through the years. While not especially deep in its plot line, the goal of child finding his parents, parents finding their child and all finding each other has a philosophical depth that warms the heart.
1603400842|4.0|This was a really good book and the story of the hound's legend makes it cooler. Sherlock Holmes thought of everything to solve the mystery. I don't quite remember how each and every character is connected, but the overall setup, mystery, and explanation behind everything is very good.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love this book for several reasons; it is current, unexpected twists, and three very engaging characters.  DeMille doesn't disappoint.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|It is hard to describe Lana's style. But whatever it is I keep finding myself wanting more. The smooth and sultry aspects of the music are enhanced by the edginess of the lyrics and emotion of the meaning.<br />Lana's got a great smokey and attractive voice.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Really fun movie to watch, especially for middle aged couples -- who will probably easily relate to what this couple goes through. LOL
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Lana's music is full of emotion. And this album is a constant source of smooth, smokey and evocative tunes and lyrics.
030758836X|5.0|Generally, I read literary fiction and avoid most books described as thrillers or mysteries.  It's not that I have anything against thrillers/mysteries.  It's just that I usually prefer character-driven fiction, and most thrillers/mysteries are very plot driven and sometimes rely on formulaic characters.  I'm so glad I didn't apply my usual formula and decided to read Gone Girl even though it's described as a thriller.<br /><br />I would describe this novel as a literary thriller.  It's equally character-driven and plot-driven, and neither half of the book suffers.  The plot is filled with unexpected turns, but Gillian Flynn still takes the time to fully develop her characters.  On top of that, Flynn's prose is well-written and tightly constructed and contains an internal momentum that only adds to the novel's tension.  Once I started reading Gone Girl, I couldn't stop.  Now that I'm finished, I can't stop trying to get all my friends to read it so I can discuss the (controversial) ending with them.
B0011Z8S8E|4.0|This is an excellent album with great Tracy Chapman classics.<br />If you like Tracy I would definitely recommend this one.
B009329Y30|5.0|Great movie! Has become a movie that is thrown in my dvd player often as a 'stand by' great movie! :)
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|wanted to see at theater but did not have the time. much better than was expecting. full of action. very intense. would probably watch again.
B006C1DH92|5.0|My daughter enjoys playing fruit ninja.  This themed Puss in Boots fruit ninja is even better with different fruit and play options.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i have loved the coin pushers at the fair for years.  now i can play it all day, every day
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Red Country is the last of three stand alone books written in the First Law Universe. It is Western inspired romp with some familiar, and new faces. Joe Abercrombie is an inspired and inspiring fantasy author who has brought new life to an often stale genre.
1594135851|1.0|I really was looking forward to this book and was really disappointed when it arrived and it was a LAGE print copy....ended up going to the bookstore and picking another copy right away.  I am talking bigger than any children's book that I have seen.  Had to sell this one on ebay.
0345802934|2.0|IQ84 just might be the Murakami book that broke me, which revealed an author I once cherished as a charlatan. I know that's not the case of course. His ability to write is undeniable, but his genius definitely remains in doubt. I never held the unconventional plot structures against him, nor the penchant for anti-climax. I loved the way he made magic out of the everyday minutia of existence, because many who dream in colors grandiose spend their waking days between books, beers and quiet moments of inaction. But IQ84 said in its first 800 pages what it could have said in 200. Perhaps some readers enjoyed the prolongation of inaction just so they could spend more time inside the world of IQ84. My favorite books by him, Kafka on the Shore and Norwegian Wood certainly left me wanting more by the end. But IQ84 became tedious to the point of frustration. Is Murakami a one trick pony? He certainly seems to rely on the same plot devices which by this point have become completely stale. If you pick up any one of his books, you will be troubled not to find any/all of these recurring themes:<br /><br />1.) A 30-year-old man man will take an inordinate interest in a 16-year-old girl's breasts, though the consummation of his feelings for said breasts is not a given.<br /><br />2.) Every character speaks with the voice of Murakami. Doctors, street cleaners, anyone you encounter will summate any experience with simile.<br /><br />3.) Everyone loves classical and jazz music because Murakami loves classical and jazz music!<br /><br />4.) Everyone drinks beer and enjoys the art of cooking!<br /><br />5.) As I mentioned before, anti-climax is the only climax one can expect. His books peter out rather than end with a bang, though this is not always a minus.<br /><br />6.) He uses sex as a cheap gimmick. You feel a conscious effort to titillate from a seemingly aloof position, as if he were a frustrated teenage boy sublimating sexual urges through writing.<br /><br />7.) Some little troll-like man made from genetic leftovers will slither into the plot.<br /><br />8.) Most monsters end up being made of sperm in various states of coagulation. Murakami's dream world is apparently a wet dream involving 16-year-old girls!<br /><br />9.) Hints of bitterness regarding events that transpired when the Soviets invaded lands occupied by Imperial Japan.<br /><br />10.) He seemingly cannot write a book that is set in a time later than 1984, because he himself was in his early 30s in 1984, and thus cannot translate the experiences of a 30-something man into the modern world. Is every book a form of coded nostalgia for some events which are stuck in a constant feedback loop in his head? Are most of his books variations on the same theme? Who in the hell was that 16-year old girl that has apparently haunted him for the past 30 years???<br /><br />I cannot remember if he does this in his other novels, but something that began to grate at my nerves in IQ84 is the incessant need for characters to summate every bloody sentence that has just been said to them. This is a close approximation of how most passages containing dialogue go:<br /><br />A: \\"I am going to the store because I am hungry.\\"<br /><br />B: \\"So what you are saying is, you have not eaten food for a sufficiently long period of time, creating feelings of hunger within you, and therefore you are going to the store in order to purchase food so that you might come home, prepare it, and eat it. It is as if your stomach were a wheel rolling through the steppe, and then you stumbled upon foot hills which created friction against your once steady movement. This friction seemingly punctuates every movement with intensified feelings of listlessness, and the only way you can begin moving smoothly again is to return to that steppe of satiation, which in this case, will be achieved by going to the grocery store in order to purchase food that you can prepare and eat.\\"<br /><br />A: \\"Yes, that is correct.\\"<br /><br />I started dreading the dialogue. Now that his voice is so familiar, would I find brilliance in the books I once enjoyed, or would I be nauseated to find that my 10-point plan for writing a Murakami book is much closer to the truth than the hyperbolic sarcasm with which I mocked him? Perhaps I have just grown tired of him beating the same dead horse.<br /><br />The real question is, after 926 pages, this book has said nothing to me. Was there any point at all in reading it? A dream like world need not have a message, but to feel compelled to write your longest novel without anything resembling a core  or a point, where the few devices which made far shorter works enjoyable were used with less skillful execution, I hate to say it, but this book is a waste of time. It is escapism in the purest sense. But if weaving a narrative out of the minutia of a dream is your intention, then why let it drag on until it becomes a nightmare?

B007IXWL2C|5.0|i read all three books and they're great! they are really intresting and have a good story line poeple hate on this book because they think its bad and just all about sex there is more to it and i recommend it to any woman out there that will enjoy a good book!!!
B0086700CM|3.0|I won a Kindle fire and I spend a good amount of time with the grand kids and they love to<br />play this game.  It looks like a good clean game for any age,
B00943SQCI|5.0|Excellent re-make of a classic and Johnny Depp did an excellent job.  Depp's originally speaking with the former actor of Barnus Collins truly paid off in this movie.  All of the actors did an excellent job.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My timing was unfortunate--began this book right before<br />final exams/grading/posting, so every morning until it<br />was finished, I'd wake up at 5 a.m. to find out what<br />happened next....exhausting, but worth it!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great way to take the classic stories and turn them into something into the 21st century in which our children will now have a new appreciation of the old stories.  Now the stories are not just dull or boring; now they literally spring to life and have a meaning and sometimes a purpose.  Job well done by ABC.
B000002QWD|5.0|I have this record ....RECORD..and sadly, I do not have a turntable to play it on any longer....is it worth anything?  It is wonderful!!  Has the same picture but different name....any info is appreciated...thx
B009K0P10K|5.0|Really great if you are into looking at something with alot of foreshadowing and suspense.  Revenge takes you on a roller coaster ride which starts off slow and then really speeds up.
B006ON41FC|1.0|This is a cute game I used to enjoy by turning off the Kindle Fire's WiFi. After all, no wi-fi, no Open Feint data mining. However a recent update removed this opportunity. Now, the game will not load unless connected to the internet.<br /><br />OBVIOUS DATA MINER! Open Feint is hidden within the program so you cannot simply turn it off. If you try to remove the Open Feint account on your device, it automatically creates a new one.<br /><br />AVOID!
B004HYDM0A|5.0|I thought it was refreshing to watch a movie that didn't involve violence and had a real life story to tell.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Kids and I absolutely love this game! Tons of fun for hours. Its also really good to distract you from any stress in life!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I wanted to love this movie.  I honestly did.  The last Christian Bale incarnation of the dark knight was superb and deserving of the 5 stars, but this one just couldn't measure up.  The dialogue and plot were both tediously slow.  Even though I loved Ann Hathaway as 'Cat Woman', the movie was too ponderous and weighted down by its slow poorly developed plot.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I think you guys have great things, and i tell all my friends to look at what you have, and what I got.
B004H0M8EA|4.0|I have enjoyed &#34;Collapse&#34; as the first book that I have read on the subject.  Jared Diamond's reconstruction of collapsed societies is very interesting although I have heard lately that it is not original.  Garbage and feces are rarely subjects of interest but in this book they lead to important insights.  Diamond discusses how various societies rise and fall with emphasis on causes such as climate change and, especially, destruction of the environment.  Underlying his discussion is his debt to the Reverend Malthus who made the famous prediction that population would outstrip food supply.  Clearly, this theory is validated over and over again.<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars because it could have used better editing.  There is some needless repetition and wordiness.  However, I think that he offers a very interesting introduction to an important and timely subject.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Overall, this is a good flick.  A bit heavy on the gore for me and I would have preferred (spoiler alert)<br /><br />a single ending  to the double ending the director decided to go with but as I said, even with those perceived shortcomings, the movie moved along well and had a couple of good twists built into it.  4 out of 5 guns....I mean stars.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Got this file to do a work around so that I could have flash player on my Kindle Fire HD. Works great.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is inspirational. I'm from his area, recognize him, but didn't realize how heroic he was. I've recommended it to my friends and family
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the most creative shows put out in a very long time.  Always leaves you hanging, wishing the next episode was ready.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Great graphics, fun &quot;time waster&quot;, I enjoy playing before bed to help me wind down.<br />If you're looking for a game to make you think or challenge you, this is not it....
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I usually do not care for &#34;dark&#34; movies but this was excellent and the ending was a surprise.<br />Great performances and great script.
0312330537|5.0|Excellent book. A long read but kept me wanting more. An inspiring work that leaves the reader wanting to travel to India, as well.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Loved all three movies from Nolan. This was a great ending to what has to be the darkest Batman series.
B00004YLIU|5.0|Best alternative experimental album all the time. The size is little bit &#34;weird&#34; (i have an automatic turntable) but its cute :D
B0055SWM08|4.0|Just don't start playing unless you have a lot of free time.  Once you get started it is hard to put down.
B007MJT1K2|4.0|I just didn't really think this looked very fun.  My boyfriend wanted to watch it, so I agreed, reluctantly.  But it was totally fun.  Great animation, really beautiful to watch.  And funny and intriguing, too.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I have a Droid Bionic. The best sleep aid I have found (for me) is plain white noise. For some reason, when playing white noise, there is a pause during the loop. It makes it pretty much useless for me.<br /><br />As a side note, my old Droid 1 seems to have no issues playing the loops, so maybe it's a multi-core issue?
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I've recently developed a real love for Joss Whedon.  Why did they have to get rid of Firefly?  He's brilliant.  I read that he took the script for this movie, which had been penned by someone else, and re-wrote it...added his own ideas, humor, brilliance.  I was wondering how they were going to pull off a movie with SO many fantastical characters sharing screen time.  They totally pulled it off.  I love this movie.  I love superheros.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|It was really pretty good. I like the fact that I read it last because it tied all the pieces together from the trilogy.
B008602KQI|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is extremely talented.  These books were fantastic, and this is a good adaptation of them.  Some complained that they weren't violent enough (weird.  Kids killing each other isn't violent enough?)  This isn't Battle Royal.  If you want to watch Battle Royal, watch Battle Royal.  I'm glad they made the movies so that the kids reading the books could watch them.  They maintain the spirit of the books.  Just the way they should. The books are better, but I'm not sure this movie could have been improved much.
1449410243|5.0|I got this book for my best friend for Christmas. Before I wrapped it however, I couldn't resist looking it over myself and wanted to keep it! It is funny and clever -- I love a sense of humor and cats!! My friend and I joke we'll be (and are) real-life &#34;cat ladies&#34; and we are proud to admit it!
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Are those miniatures making up those movie sets?  I read very mixed reviews of this movie before I saw it.  I'm a big Wes Anderson fan, though I think, lately, he's been relying too heavily on his stylized tricks.  This is sort of the impression I got from some critics.  So, I had somewhat low expectations, which may have been a good way to approach this film.  Because it was funny, clever, and had that mesmerizing quality of his earlier movies (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, and his not stylized--and first--Bottle Rocket), and Fantastic Mr. Fox.  And it has an awesome cast.  It wont be my favorite of his films (that spot will continue to be held by The Royal Tenenbaums), but it's going to keep at the top of the list.
1451648537|5.0|This autobiography is a perfect look inside one of the greatest minds of our time. This is a great book for anyone who enjoys learning about the lives of people who so influence our lives with the products they create. It is insightful to learn more about what makes a person like Steve Jobs achieve so much in their lifetime. I would recommend to many people especially those who find Apple products appealing.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I'm pretty easy.  I'll watch some really stupid movies and I'm easily entertained.  This movie was stupid, as I anticipated it would be.  But it was also just bad.  And gross.  I'm not very easily offended.  I like crass, dark, even violent (sometimes) humor.  Sometimes things just aren't funny.  I got the impression from my mother that this movie was dumb, but worth watching.  I actually found myself wishing I could have that time back.  The last movie I remember feeling that way about was Ghost Rider...which was better...seriously.  Don't pay money to watch this.
B003Y5H556|1.0|I bought this item on black friday, but i received the wrong one. Mine have not a slipcase and 2 discs. It's a simple disc in a amaray. I was not happy but I can't return it because I open the package. I pay only 3,99 so it's not a biog deal. I must bought another one. This time the right one.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|It just wasn't what I expected. I did love every song that they sang though. I wasn't expecting a musical.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I like every book of Grisham's I have read!  He has a style of writing that compells me to read until I have finished the book.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I've read all of Grisham's legal thrillers.  As with the rest of them, the book keeps you glued to the pages.  While this is definitely better than some of his more recent works, which I felt were a bit formulaic, the plot is so unbelievable as to take away from the suspense.  It's one of those books where you just go with it, but at the end realize that there were about fifty easier ways to accomplish the goal that were ignored simply because they wouldn't have been as interesting.  I gave this three stars, but I was rounding up.  It's more like two and a half.  Good way to kill a few hours, which I suppose is the goal.  Not a classic by any standard, however.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|fast shipment. purchased for sister's 30 th birthday as this move was released in 1982. haven't watched movie so not sure about quality of film
0307730697|5.0|I ordered my book from Amazon.  Couldn't wait to read.  It was very good.  My husband and I read the same book at the same time.  Great story about courage and faith.  Couldn't put it down.  Hope they make a movie of it!
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|Enjoyed all the music!  Relived the movie and like matching up the songs with the scenes!  I recommend it for anyone who enjoyed the movie!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was one of the best games I have completed that held my attension all the way through!  The puzzles were very intense but worked through with a little head scratching.  Good animation help to hold your attension!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The movie moved pretty slow in the middle. Other that that, a great movie!:) I would recommend this movie to my friends.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it--I think it would be difficult to follow or fully comprehend without having grown up in the 80s.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Just what I needed to keep my voyager pro+ going.., nice with the foam covers included..oem quality. Definitely would recommend these.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|been reading this off  and on for 6 months all of the stories are entertaining and keep you on the edge of your seat. i am fascinated by Sherlock Holmes. I find myself trying to think like him all the time. amazing writing and amazing characters.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|If you got into SP because of Siamese Dream, you won't be disappointed by Oceania. Simply loud, powerful, angsty rock.  The first 'Pumpkins album I've listened to over and over again for several weeks after I bought it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie became my second favorite holiday movie of all time. I LOVE Buddy!!!!!<br />I recommended this movie to ALL Will Ferrell Fans.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I know that commercials pay the bills for television series, but I'm impatient, not to mention busy. Then I got my dad addicted to the show, and he wanted to catch up on season three, well enter Amazon with a Walking Dead season pass, now he's all caught up, I don't have commercials and we are STUCK UNTIL FEBRUARY!
1449410243|2.0|First off, its a gift and I didn't read it all, or much.<br />Every page I looked at was not as funny as the title suggested.<br />I had a feeling the whole book was about cats wanting to murder people but it was just one page.<br />Because I hate it, my wife will probably love it.
B000GOU4M4|4.0|I'd rate it a 5, but the sound is a bit trying. Loud as heck during non-speaking, action parts; not loud enough during conversations. I'd buy a dvd instead.
1452110581|2.0|First off, its a gift and I didn't read it all, or much.<br />Every page I looked at was not as funny as the title suggested.<br />Because I hate it, my wife will probably love it.
0061191981|5.0|Great book, loved every word of it and very insightful. if you are a fan or just a cook it is worth a read, and i paid a great price for it.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|One of the better JR novels i have read in a long time, and I would like JR To meat the sheriff again.
B009JBZH54|1.0|The movies were great and are even better when watching them back to back. However when I bought my Blu-Ray player I made the decision to buy only the premium products (deluxe edition/special editions/directors cuts etc etc) I did not want to clutter up my collection with movies I might watch once or maybe twice. The things I buy now I know I will watch at lease several times. The reason I gave it one star is simply because AFTER you open it there is a little piece of paper telling you that in 2013 there will be a Deluxe Edition box set released. I would have rather waited and paid a little more for the deluxe edition.<br /><br />Also each disk goes from scenes in full screen to letterbox and back again but I am told that is because of the IMAX scenes.<br /><br />If you are like me and want to buy the special/deluxe editions in box sets do not buy this YET.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, so I decided to buy it. From the purchaser and everything came in on time and nothing wrong with the BluRay. It was great!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I'm not a typical Stephen King fan (horror novels just aren't my thing), but I was totally fascinated with this personal look into King's writing -- and especially his encouragement and advice to newbie writers. He doesn't mince words about the work involved if you want to have a chance at professional writing, he is frank that if you are writing \\"for the money or success\\" you maybe shouldn't pursue the business, and he is encouraging to those who are generally overwhelmed by the journey. In the end, I think he accomplishes what he set out to accomplish: encourage those who love to write -- to write. And he gives practical advice that you might not find in any other book on the subject.
0307887960|5.0|thank you for this easy to read outline ( 4 phases) to eating to loose the excess pounds and then maintaining ideal weight. Eatting &#34;all the foods you want&#34; from certain lists kept me from feeling limited- I didn't reach for sugar or bread- I just reached for another food on the list, and seeing the numbers on the scale close in on my goal increased a pleasurable sense of being. I am currently in phase 2 and look forward to using this book as a guide for the next several months. It has helped me increase my vegetable & protein intake which I was so ready for!
B004OZOTSQ|3.0|I like the way it works. It is an easy way to load and unload files for Kindle without wires.
B0086700CM|3.0|This game is noting more than a mind occupier.  Most of the games I have reveiwed are not challenging and I have found you can not win.  A good past time when you are really bored.<br /><br />Knight68
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really like the peaceful background music.  It gives you a sense of peace even as you're are being challenged...it keeps you going level after level.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|this game is so ridculous that is makes me laugh.  I spend time playing and laugh at myself while asking why in the world are you doing this.  I can not find any redeeming qualities to this game and yet at a certain level I enjoy it.  Go figure.<br /><br />knight68
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I think we've only played this game once. We're not really into Angry Birds in this house. I would recommend it though.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Excellent movie!!! I loved it. The show the action and everything is just so amazing ! goooood job for the director !
B004UID2LC|4.0|It is good to have. I like it. I would recommend it to everyone. YouTube is great for everyone! =)
B0034DGPEU|4.0|If you love stories about the south, then this book is worth the<br />read.  It is enlightening about the realities of slavery in the pre-civil war era.  A wonderful story about the family you are born too and the family you choose.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I like the piano. My son, my fiance, and I play it a lot. I would recommend it to everyone!
B009329Y30|3.0|As usual, the book is better. Not sure why I even bother with the movies.  I'm always left feeling like something is missing.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Good follow up record. Not as good as the first though, it takes a little while to grow on you. Definately worth the buy.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I purchased season 1 and finished it in one week and then went back on Amazon to get this season.  I haven't finished it, but only because I'm rationing myself because I know I can't see Season 3 until January !!!  Highly recommended.

B000I0QL82|5.0|This is one of my favorite Bing Crosby movies, as it has not only Bing Crosby but Fred Astaire in it.  The singing and dancing is wonderful and the story line is cute as well.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I loved this book but I read it in about 3 hours. So I feel like I wasted 7 bucks :(
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, but after watching a lot of vlogbrothers on Youtube and hearing John read the second chapter of this book, I decided to get it. I read the whole thing in one day, because it was just that awesome!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best season so far and it a great series.  I have see all the seasons and this is so far my favorite but you need the context of past ones to really get some of the characters.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|Enjoyable beyond description.  Saw it in the theater and wanted my own personal copy.  I now have it.  Well worth the cost.
1423113497|5.0|Both my teen and pre-teen love this series! They have read and re-read them many times. Now they even got the t-shirts :)

067144901X|5.0|I loved reading this book to my kids when they were toddlers, and they loved it too.  It's so much fun, so silly and makes the kids laugh.  My youngest is now 8 and I still remember it :-)
B0086700CM|3.0|I get dizzy easily apparently, watching my character run and jump on the screen. Yikes! It's fun, but really frustrating for someone who usually plays more word or character games rather than 'action' games.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is an amazing story, and I find myself telling everyone I know about it. I recommend this book to both skeptics and believers alike.
B000QXDED6|1.0|If you want to learn about history of the 300, get a hold of the 1962 version.  I watched both of these movies in the same day.  There is also a very good documentary about the 300, which I saw a few months ago (Sorry forget the name of it). While I thought some parts of the 1962 version were dated and cheesy.  This version which I had high hopes for was horrible.  It was kind of like they took lord of the rings and merged it with a historical story, sorry best way I can describe the look, feel, music and storyline.  The results were a very poor movie.  The strange radioactive mutant creatures that fought the Spartans were never explained, and very un-historical.  Why were they in the movie?  Also, king Xerxes looked like he was a Villain from a \\"Mad Max\\" movie rather than a Persian King.  And the story line was laughable, stupid and very lame.  It looks like Very little research was done on the setting, costumes, period music and much more.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My husband LOVES the Piano Guys so I got him this CD along with the bonus tracks CD and he loves them just as I thought he would. Anyone who loves good piano and relaxing music will NOT be disappointed!

B00138H146|1.0|The best track, &#34;Intro/Sweet Jane&#34; is missing!?!?<br />What a rip-off!<br />Must have something to do with Steve Hunter not getting paid?
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Can't say enough good about this series. Finished the first two in about 48 hours. Completely different, but still felt a bit like the best of  Hunger games and twilight rolled into one. It caught my attention immediately and now I am counting down the days until March 5th! My only complaint (although completely get it) was Alex not being in this book. Broke my heart a bit.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator is hassle free and a great app to have on any android tablet. it's a must have quick and efficient.
B000069HZP|4.0|David Fincher manages to take this story and screenplay (John Brancato & Michael Ferris) and makes it almost believable.  The film is a mash-up between Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and Philip K. Dick's \\"Total Recall.\\"  Michael Douglas is very good in the Scrooge-like role of Nicholas Van Orton, a high powered San Francisco investment banker.  He's very wealthy, probably in the top 1/2%, let alone 1%.<br /><br />He's also very lonely and seemingly unhappy.  As a surprise, his gadfly, devil-may-care younger brother, Conrad (Sean Penn) shows up and gives him a gift certificate for his 48th birthday.  It requires Nicholas  to show up for a series of interviews which allows a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) to design a \\"game\\" for him.  You know, it's for the man who has everything.<br /><br />When Nick gets a phone call advising him CRS won't be able to work with him, he thinks nothing of it.  What he doesn't know is that the game has just begun.  Like Douglas Quaid in \\"Total Recall,\\" Nick isn't quite sure what is going on.  He is put in physical, financial and mental danger.  The film is beautifully shot and has surprise after surprise.  Eventually Nick and the rest of us catch on.<br /><br />But what is real and what is part of the game, is sometimes hard to discern.  The story tends to jump-the-shark in the final act which left me shaking my head.  Still, \\"The Game\\" is a well-made film with some solid acting, great sets and photography and an invigorating score by Howard Shore.  The Criterion version is certainly a significant upgrade from the DVD in terms of picture and sound.
0792839749|5.0|This is a great family movie and one of the classics of our childhood.  I good film to share with the kids, and a fun time for all.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|Love the idea of doing all this in the cloud! (Hehe - funny - Purple Rain - cloud...ah well, easily amused, methinks...)<br />Easy access to this Prince classic - can listen on my Android without taking up phone storage space!<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon!
B00005RIKD|5.0|I am a huge Sting fan and have been since the 80's, but this albums rendering of many of his greatest hits in a smooth jazz style is, for me at least, the pinnacle of his ability to master any style.  I was so pleased to find it available and at a price I could afford and to find it delivered to me in excellent condition, as promised.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great book that makes me want to keep reading.  You really feel for the main character!  Can't wait to read another book from Blake!

B005K17RU0|5.0|The AccyWeather app for Android is PERFECT for my Kindle Fire.  Each morning, I click it, get the hour by hour forcast, so I know exactly what my son will need to wear to school for the day.  Also, I love it that I can also have other city favorites, this way I can know how the weather is for loved ones and family around the globe.  Highly reccomend the app!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|great fun - only wish the camera foucused on the other side of the kindle.It is very simple to use
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It was ok, but not one of his favorites.  But it was ok just not as good as he thought it would be.
B005K17RU0|4.0|it's pretty good and definately alot better than the other weather program I foolishly bought.  The predictions seem to be right on.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My hubby has read all the books now, and he loved them all.  I think Suzanne Collins has very entertaining books to read.
0307596885|5.0|\\"Dance of the Happy Shades,\\" one of Alice Munro's earliest published stories (1961), shows even then that she had mastered the short story form:  \\"`She lost her powers of speech, you know. Her powers of control generally, she lost.\\" comes the answer to a perfunctory question about a bedridden parent. Then the youthful narrator describes how her parent received the reply.  \\"My mother is warned by a certain luxurious lowering of the voice that more lengthy and intimate details may follow and she says quickly that it is too bad.\\"<br /><br />Fifty-one years on, Alice Munro continues to impress.  Take this excerpt from \\"Haven\\", the fifth story in \\"Dear life\\".  \\"Aunt Dawn wore a dress that was modestly cut, made of flesh-colored crepe. It was the sort of dress an older woman might have worn and made look proper in a fussy way, but my aunt could not help looking as if she were taking part in  a slightly risqué celebration.\\" Alice Munro turns every sentence to advantage, loading it with telling observations about the character or action  she's describing. You never leave a Munro story with any doubt about what makes her characters tick. You come away convinced that  you are in the hands of an author whose people are so well realized  that  nothing more need be said for us to know them better than they know themselves.<br /><br />\\"Train,\\" the longest story, has more than enough to it to occupy your book reading group for a good hour if not longer, a conversation likely to continue over coffee. The story begins as Canada's World War II soldiers make their way home after mustering out. At the last minute, Jackson, the protagonist, jumps from the train that had but a few miles to go to reach his home town and the woman waiting there for him. Not wanting to face her, he turns and heads the other way along the tracks:<br /><br />  \\"You looked forward to emptiness. And, instead, what did you get?  An immediate flock of new surroundings, asking for your attention in a way they never did when you were sitting on the train and just looking out the window . . . . Life around coming to some conclusions about you from vantage points you couldn't see.\\"<br /><br /> The collection  also includes  a \\"Finale\\" --  four pieces ending with \\"Dear Life\\", works which, the author says, \\"are not quite stories. . . . autobiographical in feeling . . . . they are the first and last  -- and the closest - things I have to say about my own life.\\" The title for my review comes from the first of these pieces, \\"The Eye\\". Munro reflects on how it was, at an early age, \\"I began to accept that my mother's notions about me might differ from my own.\\" Munro was already thinking \\"about what was true and what wasn't.\\"<br /><br /> As a title, \\"Dear Life\\"  also works for  the collection as a whole. Time and again you find Munro's people holding on for dear life, a trait that goes all the way back to  the woman with the bed-ridden parent in \\"Dance of the Happy Shades\\" and  continues right up to the wife who feels threatened by the reawakening of her husband's romantic interest in \\"Dolly,\\" the last story before the \\"Finale\\". And the  children's school teacher at the tuberculosis hospital in \\"Amundsen\\" comes quite undone by the love her and leave her treatment she receives at the hands of the center's head doctor.<br /><br />  Munro knows as much if not more  about what life holds for us as any of the  great writers of our time. That \\"Dear Life\\" wasn't selected by the New York Times Book Review as one of the year's five best works of fiction disappoints, but should not deter you from putting it on your Christmas list. Just don't give it away until you read it.<br /><br />End note. Charles McGrath, who edited many of Munro's early stories for The New Yorker, reviewed \\"Dear Life\\" for The New York Times Book Review (November 18, 2012). If you didn't read it at the time, track it down. It offers a great many insights about Munro's stories from the vantage point of one who has followedher work from very close to the beginning.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|I watched this movie on a very turbulent plane ride and it was just what I needed to take my mind off of the bumpy flight! I was most interested to see how Daniel Radcliffe would manage and he did a very good job NOT being Harry Potter.
B007L6VR12|1.0|I avoided this in the cinema and then was chided by a friend that I followed the \\"If there's a heavy advertising campaign, avoid the film\\" self-imposed rule.  Oh, if I had only followed my instinct.  This is a waste of time.  It's hard to imagine that so much production value was put into something that had so little going for it: just a plain old bad script and horribly understated acting.
B0098VXMNE|3.0|As a woman, I'm just not loving this guy as Spartacus. The season is good, but I miss the old characters. &#34;Eh&#34; is about all I can say.
B008K6DU4Y|3.0|App is unstable on Fire HD. I  am unable to view a 2 min clip without the app shutting down. I give it 3 stars because it is the only app so far that allows me to resume an AVI movie. It's a shame it keeps stopping. It will be a great app once they fix that problem.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|It was a movie. Not a good movie or a great movie but not a bad movie either. I thought Charlize Theron was incredible (as usual). She was the best thing about it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I was so curious to see if J.K. Rowling had other stories in there and she does! This was a good book and an excellent departure from the HP series. I hope she continues to write because she is a great storyteller!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My entire family loves this app!<br />It's challenging and fun. There are several levels and the colors look great. One of our favorite apps on the kindle fire.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is the first book in a long time to really surprise me! I was told that the plot twists were good, but I didn't expect them to be THIS good! It's a great read - even though I was seriously disappointed in the end. I thought she took the easy way out and the book would have been better if she had followed through with the &#34;theme&#34;. I don't want to spoil it, but I definitely recommend this book!
1250027624|5.0|Lovely bedtime distraction from the cares of the day.  Engaging character studies of people we already care about, even the villains.
B008J34466|5.0|This is by far my favorite album if pinks, I listen to it everyday. Track 4 is the best, Just give me a reason featuring Nate Ruess
1439152802|4.0|The book was excellent, the first half was slow, but the ending was a twist I never expected.  The author could have cut the book by 50 pages if she would have left out all references to cigarettes.

B005HSL626|5.0|It is a fun way to keep your mind active. Also a way to get rid of any anger you hold towards fruit (smile). Easy for all ages.
0545265355|3.0|This story was certainly enjoyable, however no way as great a story as some make it out to be.  Maybe I have been spoiled reading a lot great writters/story tellers that I expected more.  To me it just seemed like Collins spent time developing parts of the story that were pretty much worthless, and then turned around and spent no time developing parts of the story that were crutial.  The ending seemed very rushed.  The best book of the three is book 2.<br /><br />This was given to me as a gift, good thing, as no way is this Trilogy worth $29.75.
030758836X|5.0|loved the way this book is written.....great story....totally surprised me.  Bought it to give as a gift after I read another firends copy.
B001706I5I|5.0|The kids love it. It gave me some time for what I needed to get done and know they watch<br />watching a christmas movie they all enjoy will out fighting.
B002XTXG1G|1.0|shipped fast. But this movie is not worth watchin. Tom hardy is a great actor, but nothing is this film called for good acting. Id rather you save your money and pay someone to punch you in the face than to watch this hahaha
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|After reading the other two books, its just imposible not to finish the trilogy. So recommended. It really keeps the story going, with all the dramma, suspense and intrigue. It can really keep you up all night reading.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|In short and I have watched both......Peter Frampton's FCA 35 Tour DVD blows Led Zeppelin's Celebration Day DVD out of the water!!!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Nice story, mostly for young adults ( or old teens ), but is a really enjoyable book, and a good preparation for the third book of the trilogy
0525953728|5.0|Kept the reader involved and wanting to know more. I read it in several days, and could have done it in a sitting if time allowed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love how the lifes of people involved in war are shown..... really enjoyed reading how the story develops!... it really got me thinking in how war can be driven and how it would affect human lifes.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|I admire his deep thinking and passion in his songs and verses.<br />Philosophy of his art is far deeper, then you can feel in other authors songs.
0316056871|5.0|I love Tina Fey's down-to-earth attitude and self-deprecating humor.  She's actually a normal person despite her fame.  A quirky and enjoyable read.  Warning: If reading in a public setting, don't be surprised if people look at you strangely for bursting out laughing every five minutes.  This is a normal side effect of the book.  And no, I am not reading this as a woman in her 40s.  I am 23 and found this book hilarious, enlightening, and inspiring.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Leonard Cohen is sending to listener not only wonderful music and deep verses, but his love, passion, gratitude.<br />It is pleasure to have this DVD in my collection.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|I watched about an hour of the first episode, which I believe is the movie entitled \\"Serenity.\\" It seemed disjointed to me with no real theme or distinguishing characteristics, or compelling reason to watch. It is like a soap opera in the future.
B006DHAT5K|1.0|The raunchy aspects (too many buttock views) were unnecessary to the film and ruined what could have been a simple cute romantic comedy.  The scenery was nice.
B0072OFM28|4.0|This DVD is also a gift for my son. I, not having seen the show, cannot give my review, but from what I was told, it was very good.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one of those clean, down-to-earth kind of movies that you just want to watch over and over.  Those playing the parts did a wonderful job portraying their character.  I would highly recommend this movie to anybody interested in this era and love stories of the highest, most respectable kind.
B00A5052YE|4.0|I love girl on fire, the rest of the songs are growing one me! I would suggest getting the album if you're an Alicia fan.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is a little different than the hidden object games I am used too but I. like it. good job GI
B002JIOOB2|5.0|I bought this particular Complete Series instead of a cheaper one because I wanted it to be able to fit on my DVD shelf. This works perfectly for where I wanted to put it, all the DVDs work, and it shipped on time!
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|These step up movies are great fun! All of the dance sequences are just amazing. All so you think you can dance fans will enjoy it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved It!!!!....I haven't been disappointed yet by Vince Flynn, and I have read all of his books.<br /><br />This one definately showed a bit of a different side to Mitch Rapp.  Can't wait for the next one.
B000000OQY|5.0|One of the best moments is guns history, acoustic songs and electronic rock mixed perfectly in one little disc, a must have for sure. No way some music lover could leave this one.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Was expecting an action packed, fun, adventure; I got a long, drawn out melodrama with some explosions and a plot that is about as believable as Alice in Wonderland. I get the whole &#34;guy in a black hero suit&#34; thing does not lend itself to believable plots, but this was so corny as to be stupid. What a waste of $5.
B000000OQF|5.0|Simply the best work ever for guns... Powerful, truthful, savage and original. Once again this is and old piece, no reason for anyone to not have it in this physical form.
B005DNPHN4|5.0|What's not to like. Very well done. Fun, good story, great acting, it earned the Oscar it won. A really solid flick.
B000000P17|3.0|Weird sound, funny tribute, but as Guns don't have a large discography is good to expend a little money on every single piece.
B0088WGBC8|4.0|Very action packed and full of suspense.  I love Denzel and he really is a great hardworking actor.  He is so believable in his roles.  I could watch this again
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|Let me be clear that i have not seen this yet so this is a hypothetical review.  First of all let me just say that I very nearly had the chance to see all 15 hours of this giant undertaking.  I am in the habit of going to Minneapolis every 3 weeks to visit friends and see films.  Sadly, the weekend The Walker Art Center was showing 5 hours of this each day did not match up for me.  I have no doubt that this wont be worth my time.  Just the fact that Mark Cousins talked with Lars von Trier for this---and after he put his foot in his mouth at Cannes von Trier said he is not doing interviews anymore---might just be one of the better reasons to get STORY OF FILM (the others being Claire Denis, Wim Wenders, etc. and on and on).<br /><br />But I must say I am saddened that it has taken so long to come out on DVD (original release date was Nov. 20th and I am a very impatient person).  Nevermind something of this magnitude should probably have a Blu-ray release.  The only other thing I can complain about is the price.  As $60 is not bad for 15 hours worth of viewing, I am tempted just the same to cancel my order before tomorrow and hopefully buy from a third party for a cheaper price.  Hey, Amazon its Christmas and I am not a wealthy person this time of year.
B0083GOPSG|2.0|This is an entertaining movie for the teenage crowd but there is nothing special about this movie.  This item appeared in my &#34;review your purchases&#34; and I had no idea what it was.  I had to go back and read the description to even remember what the movie was about.  Yes it was that forgettable.
B003AZZN9U|3.0|I wear a 10.5 or 11, but in these boots a 10 would have fit just right. They do look good, but I had to return them.
B007SNMVH2|3.0|My boyfriend loves these underworld movies because of the action and special effects in all the underworld movies.  This one does not disappoint.  It is full of action and special effects.  I just cannot stand these vampire type movies.  The story lines are absolutely ridiculous to me.  If it weren't for the action and effects I would have been sleep about 15 min in.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the first two seasons, but it seems I have to wait on Season 3.  Wish I knew how to get Season 3 ahead of time from airing.  I would gladly purchase.  It was a wonderful series.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are awesome together in this movie.  They both play their characters really well and they are so funny in this movie.  This one is even more suspenseful than the first.  Its really slow to get into but builds really well.  I enjoyed this movie.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I was very excited when I found out that Avast was available for my Coby (and my cell phone).  I already have it on my laptop and my pc.  I do love this product.  It has been able to catch &#34;things&#34; that others weren't.  I won't mention other products but this product outdoes them, hands down.
1419705849|5.0|This was a pre-order book and I was very excited to order it without having to fight the crowds.  I have done all of my shopping this year without ever going into a store.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The delivery took 3 additional days from the estimated delivery date but that's just the postal service.  The product was packed very securely.  The WD is an awesome series from AMC and I recommend everyone to watch it.  I bought season 1 and 2 in an offer, great price!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was amazing.  If there is anyone that doubts the Sacrifices that men and women make everyday for our freedoms this will surely clear them up.  The story is also one of perservering against all odds, it is without a doubt inspiring.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|The delivery took 3 additional days from the estimated delivery date but that's just the postal service.  The product was packed very securely.  The WD is an awesome series from AMC and I recommend everyone to watch it.  I bought season 1 and 2 in an offer, great price!
B003TXT5ZQ|5.0|No words except... it's Shakespeare. What more can you ask? It's one of the best structures in writing than you can get because Shakespeare clearly marks how any conflict, in the end, is all about power.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good easy read.  I was able to read it in just one day and even though it was somewhat predictable, I still really enjoyed reading it.
B000HAB4KS|4.0|Not only has it aged well but this movie just gets better each time you watch it. The DVD arrived promptly, too and was well packages. RECOMMENDED!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Patricia had stated on her FB page that this booked would answer some questions that people always ask.  I found it Awesome until the last page, didnt like how it ended and didnt feel like it answered any questions from the series.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|With a few changes here and there the reshooting of past movies sometimes leaves much to be desired... but the visual effects are updated with some great effects.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I think it is the best of all John Grisham's books.  It was suspenseful and not the usual courtroom dry drama.  It was great.  He should write more books in this style.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|While it seems that there is a never ending stream of movies that advocate that being different is a good thing... it is fun to see how they do it.  Tried and true theme.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Had to add this trilogy to my collection and this is just what I needed. Love the quality and price I paid.
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate does a great job explaining how statistics work and why it's so hard for most people (including myself)<br />to objectively assess the odds of something happening.  If you enjoy reading Nate's blog, you would also enjoy this book.  Highly recommended.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|LEAVES YOU WITH JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SUSPENSE FOR NEXT SEASON CANT WAIT UNTIL FEBUARY WHEN MID SEASON BEGINS
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|This is absolutely one of my very favorite movies with two of my very favorite actors and one of the best sound tracks, I listen to it a few times a month. Fantastic story on what love is, the journey of finding love, why we go through heartaches, and shows a Hollywood Movie true to love itself, not true to limmerance.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was refreshing to read this book. Seems like all the stories get re-hashed, but this one was truly different - and engaging. It's a quick read... you won't stop until you get to the last book.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm absolutely addicted to this show...season two is even better than the first! Worth the money and then some! If you like horror/paranormal it's a must!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good fun games!  play games to earn tokens to have more games!  no problems so far.  I have a kindle fire.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|so scared. when I fell asleep I thought about Freddy krueger getting chased by someone .......... or something. I found a note that really scared the creep out of me!!!!!
B001GH3YG8|5.0|see above. If you don't get it, you never will. This album is alternatively heart racing and subtle. An incredible auditory journey.
0385736002|5.0|Condition:  New.<br />Shipping:  Good.<br /><br />The is one of the Nicholas Flamel books from the series of the same name (except add &#34;The Secret of the Immortal&#34; to the front of &#34;Nicholas Flamel&#34;).  This is an excellent series of books that are fairly easy reads.<br /><br />The series character was actually a fairly popular historical figure who, according to wikipedia, &#34;was a successful French scrivener and manuscript-seller who developed a posthumous reputation as an alchemist due to his reputed work on the philosopher's stone.&#34;  His cult status was emphasized in the Harry Potter series, who's first book was titled after the famous stone.<br /><br />NOTE:  This book series is not related to the Harry Potter &#34;universe&#34; or series.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I choose the game because my grandson had play it with his friends and want us to have it. We start playing and we were hook
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a fantastic story. Truly hard to put down, even with my toddler pulling the house apart. I can not wait to pick up more from this author.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It came as a FREE game for my new Kindle and I have been playing this game for years.I don't understand the scoring as of right now. Maybe I will figure it out.
B008KE3960|5.0|Great time killer. Downloaded to my Kindle Fire and it works great. Gameplay is fun and addictive; best of all its free! Definitely recommend.
B001P59V5Y|4.0|The &#34;Life of Brian&#34; is a great spoof on life in ancient Judea under roman occupation. it is not really a religious satire as so many people seem to think. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone who likes the Python's style of humor.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|By the time Hollywood makes a third movie (unless it's like Star Wars or LOR), it usually isn't worth watching, so I waited until it came out on video. Now I'm sorry I didn't see it on the big screen!  It didn't disappoint at all and I really enjoyed myself.  It had all of the glib Will Smith humor that I've loved since he was the Fresh Prince and the deadpan humor of &#34;what's his name&#34;. :)  James Brolyn did a fabulous younger K.  When they come out with the boxed set, I imagine I'll have to buy it.  Anyway, I highly recommend it.
0756404746|5.0|This book is a great book. It fallows the life of its Main Character Coth as he tells the story of his life. Rothfuss did excellent on getting you to fall in love with Coth. he is a very believable character.  He is powerful yet not all powerful. he is a good guy but yet still makes mistakes. If you are looking for your normal formic fantasy this isn't it, but if you relay want to know a chatterer and see them grow and develop and you like fantasy setting I can think of no better book.
0525953590|4.0|It is beautifully written in easily digested language for everybody.This book describes about the endless effort of human's intellectual to probe the ultimate reality
B001P5M7QE|4.0|Good film as ever. After taking a collage level medieval history class a actually enjoyed the film even more. It's amazing how much history the Python's managed to hide and satire in a single film.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Best. TV. SHOW. EVER. I've seen my fair share of TV shows and this one just blows my mind. the writing, the acting, the character developments, the make up....everything is just so awesome. I hate  some characters and love others, which I think is exactly what the show wants. I can't wait to keep watching.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I love how you can download videos and watch them when you aren't connected to WiFi but half the time the app crashes, won't play the video, or the app just won't open. This would be a 5 star app if it worked properly.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I can't wait to keep watching. Season 1 hooked me and Season 2 and the first half of Season 3 has just kept digging deeper into my mind as I become a numb zombie watching this show and just wanting more...like the zombies for fresh meat....
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This was a cute movie. A little awkward at times but in a good way. I love Meryl Streep and she did a great job in this movie!
0307592731|4.0|This is a great book; anyone who loves to hike will enjoy her adventures. I highly recommend it as a terrific Xmas present!
B008PZ69T8|5.0|just beautiful music. so relaxing and enjoyable. All songs by very professional artusts. I play it for backround music at home continually.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|There was one episode that seemed like it was simply written in after the fact and placed in the middle of the season but other than that I loved it. Used amazon instant stream for the first time too and loved that as well.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|If you like spoof movies that aren't slapstick and can stand stalone. I think this is o.k. Man these guys are way too old for serious action flicks.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel from the first page to the last. Many characters...many lessons to be learned....this is a novel about acceptance of oneself and of others you meet along the way....adapting to life....recognizing and enjoying the &#34;small&#34; things in life...recognizing that the small things are really the big things! LOVED this book.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Ties up the loose ends from the previous movies. These guys are too old to make another movie. Overall enjoyed very much.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|As a big SG fan, I highly anticipated this album. I'll admit, I was nervous it was going to sound like another Chris Cornell solo album. However, they definitely managed to deliver an album that sounds like it could have come out 1998. The classic SG &#34;bite&#34; isn't quite there, but is instead replaced by a matured, angsty roar. Overall, I am extremely pleased and hope for a follow up album.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Sequels are typically disappointing, so my expectations for MIB3 were low.  I could not have been more wrong!  While the film does have a couple of slow spots, and I personally didn't like the very ending of the movie, the rest of the film was funny, action-filled, and true to the formula that made the first two films a success.  If you're a MIB fan, I don't thnk you'll be disappointed.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Such a great story!!! I loved the confidence both Conner and Megan had they were the perfect couple even though it was an unconventional marriage. This book takes you through the trials of marriage where it isn't love based...I don't want to give anything away so jus read the book you'll love it!
B002ZG98G4|5.0|One of the best movies in a long time. Love watching it over and over. Love the characters in their roles.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Like others I wasn't sure how much I was going to like seeing the same actors play different characters in a different setting in Season 2 but the strength of their performances very much exceeded my expectations.  I only wish the elements of horror were a little more original.  Thus far they have been borrowed from such films as The Excorcist and Silence of the Lambs
B000QUEQBS|5.0|Mark is awesome in this role. I appreciated his dedication to this role and the love of the dog shown.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I liked it immensily.  So far, I've loved reading every book I've read of David Baldacci and this one did not dissapoint me.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Love the Sherlock Holmes series with Robert Jr and Jude playing the roles. I love the slow motion sequences and the wit used for these movies.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I down loaded a pdf file on my tablet and could not figure out how to open it.  So, I did what anyone would do<br />I went to Amazon and down loaded Adobe Reader. When I went to open the file, my tablet offered 3 other<br />apps already on my tablet that I could use.  Gee why didn't it open the pdf file the first time I tried. I am not<br />tech smart, but I out smarted my tablet on this one. I will keep this app because to me pdf will all ways be Adobe.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|My husband loves this movie. I find him watching it atleast once a month. Ben Afleck does an awesome job!
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Halestorm is one of my favorite bands, and this CD is great!  Definitely would recommend this to a friend without hesitation.
0767827902|5.0|Peter Bogdanovich directed this masterpiece of America coming of age and everyone in it has never been better. Sad and beautiful.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|This band is awesome and their music is unique.  I would definitely recommend this CD to a friend without hesitation.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|I have been a voracious Beatles collector for almost 40 years (I'm a 2nd generation fan) and still have (and play) every Beatles and solo Beatles record I have ever purchased.  I think I'm pushing 1,000 LPs, 45s and CDs at this point.  However, I LOVE the 2009 remasters and have both the stereo and mono box sets on CD.<br /><br />Although I am an avid Amazon customer, I purchased this box set for a STEAL by pre-ordering on another web site (sorry Amazon).  I HAD planned to save it for Christmas, but the overwhelming number of negative reviews on Amazon and the 30-day return policy prompted me to check it out earlier than anticipated.<br /><br />I decided to play them in chronological order.  I cleaned each record carefully as I always do.  However, even before Paul's count-in on I Saw Her Standing There, I had a bad feeling.  As soon as the needle dropped, I heard white noise that didn't go away.  I found myself adjusting the volume, checking speakers, adjusting levels, and trying multiple headphones to get rid of the noise.  It didn't.  The quality of the remastering, as heard THROUGH the noise, was terrific, which made it all the more annoying.  I re-cleaned the LP and tried again.  No dice.<br /><br />I had similar problems with about half of the LPs, the worst BY FAR being Abbey Road.  Side one in particular was SO noisy, I was beside myself.  I have played 40+ year old copies of Abbey Road that were used as Frisbees that sounded MUCH better.  It was as though someone had pressed the record onto sandpaper.  I threw my hands up in disgust.<br /><br />That all having been said, I did find LP bliss with Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, and side two of With The Beatles.  They sounded BEAUTIFULLY QUIET and CLEAN.  It's too bad that the rest all sounded so inferior to them.<br /><br />I had no issues with the black storage box, the book, or the jackets.  However, the black Apple paper sleeves were way too tight on the later LPs.  The vinyl itself, upon visual inspection, was generally clean and undamaged, which made the noise issues so baffling.<br /><br />All said, I was crestfallen after it became obvious that I had no choice but to send the whole thing back.  I had looked forward to this release for years.  Besides, being a collector, the box set looked gorgeous and I SO wanted to keep it.  But I knew that I would not be inclined to play them again in the future, so back it went - with no hassle and a full refund.<br /><br />I'm disappointed, to say the least.  I hope Apple decides to re-press them again to a higher standard soon.  Perhaps the mono set will not have the same problems next year...
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|What more can be said about this cooker cutter comic, other than bland. The jokes rely on wacky characters instead of wit, the story is boring and unrecognizable from any other comic, like big nate , I funny, and middle school: the worst years. The art style is simplistic and childish just like this book. Maybe you enjoy it, to be honest it is enjoyable with the right mindset, but will you remember it? No.
B00005U122|3.0|I was really looking forward to this DVD, as I had read some nice reviews about it. However, I was sadly disappointed for the most part.<br /><br />Playing some well-known P.F. hits, there is a loss of stage presence by Waters in the mix. Appearing like someone who is there more out of obligation, rather than performance value, Waters remains virtually disconnected and insincere to his audience throughout the show. Long gone is the once powerful stage performer; only to be reduced to someone lost in the mire of his better counterparts. What I have learned from this DVD, essentially, is that Waters is better at conceptual writing, than he is playing an instrument; specifically the bass. Perhaps there was a time where his playing was better, but this DVD fails to demonstrate any glimpse into that past.<br /><br />Such notable players on this DVD are:<br />- Doyle Bramhall II (guitars and vocals), with his abnormal (yet fairly well played) guitar stylings, but looks like an acid-laced costumed Jimmy Page from the yesteryears of Led Zep; a REAL distraction. Helpful for the show, overall, Bramhall's vocalizations on some of the songs in the beginning have absolutely no depth; thanks probably to someone not working the mixing board correctly.<br />- Andy Fairweather Low (guitars, bass, vocals) remains consistently good throughout, while he demonstrates his experience and versatility that makes the show at least tolerable. Andy Wallace (keyboards) basically NAILS IT! Couldn't have been better.<br />- Vocalist Susannah Melvoin (Prince 1980s) is a welcome part of this lineup, proving she \\"still has the stuff!\\"<br />- Good performances by the rest of the group as well.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this was just an \\"off\\" night for Waters, but the only thing that saved him from absolute boredom was the back-up band. The songs are fairly decent, but the lack of Waters' showmanship leaves me not wanting to watch this thing again...ever.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book gave me flashbacks to my own turbulent youth in the early 70's, where I behaved rashly in order to escape from my parents and to define myself differently from how I was expected to be.  In Cheryl's case, her loss of her mother precipitates a soul-crashing series of self destructive actions in a futile attempt to hold grief at bay.  Having the totally crazy idea that walking thousands of miles on a rugged trail through California on her own would help, she goes off overloaded and underprepared, desperate to escape from her own demons.  I was compelled to read this book after hearing an interview with Cheryl Strayed on Bookworm on KCRW.  It wasn't that she was so dramatic an interviewee - quite the contrary, she was understated - but that I had a deep curiosity about how she had managed to survive.  It wasn't until after I finished the book that I understood my own compulsion to get a close-up look at her reckless adventure - I am equally astonished that I lived through the misadventures of my own early twenties.  In fact, in being amazed with her survival and transformation, I am really being amazed at my own life.<br />Both of us - we are still here.  It's the mark of the book's success that memories and insights about my own life continue to surface weeks after I finished Wild.<br /><br />Something in both of us was strong enough to go on and to live after the unthinkable had happened.  It is just perfect that Cheryl Strayed is also the author of the no-nonsense &#34;Dear Sugar&#34; column on the Rumpus Room blog site.  She writes with no judgement but with the insight that can only be born of experience.  I look forward to reading her earlier book, Torch, as well as the new collection of Sugar columns.<br /><br />I give it four stars because it is very very good - in parts, exquisite - but there were moments that I was disappointed that we were not invited to know more or to be more fully engaged in the experience.  It is a very good book, even with these small caveats.
B009JEM1PK|2.0|I was really expecting at the very least something as good as Deathless Kings. This album really sounds phoned in.
B000DZIGDU|2.0|This is one of the worst war movies that I've ever seen.Pretty boring and there was no plot and no character development.There was no point to this movie.Not much going on so the movie dragged.In the begining it looks like it might be a decent movie but it quickly went down hill.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The book was slow getting started but once you figure out who the narrator is, it begins to be very interesting. The look inside a German family and their response to the events taking place around them was enlightening. The characters become human's with quirks that are endearing. A good read!
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Good picture quality. The color version is actually very good, Looks good on my LED TV. It's a wonderful life is a true Christmas classic.
1449410243|5.0|If you read the Oatmeal, then you know what this is and have probably read most of the comics before.  So this is a great book to get if you love the Oatmeal and would enjoy having a copy of some great comics and want throw a few sheckles his way to keep making great work.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love it all my friends  love it . It has great picture and amazing creativity I really recommend this game for every one
B009JBZH54|5.0|This Dark Knight Trilogy blu-ray set seems a lil simple & basic for a boxed set, which I would've anticipated it to be fancier packaging. Overall, the Dark Knight series is just plain awesome!!! My only question to anyone reading my brief review is: Why is it that in TDKR, the picture sometimes shifts between fullscreen & widescreen? I'm confused with what's this all about, unless I missed some tech specs regarding this blu-ray compilation?

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It kept my interest from beginning to end.  Nothing was predictable.  I recommend this to all ages, I can see why they made a movie, although I never saw the movie.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have lived my life \\"for the moment\\" and that was always because I firmly believed that this life is it.  Nothing comes next.  This is your chance and then it's over.  This book gave me a whole new perspective.  There IS another life after this one and it will be even better!  I no longer have a fear of dying and almost look forward to what comes next.  The author did such a fantastic job of putting the experience into words.  Captivating.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|the best movie i ever saw.the polar express is wonderful. tom hanks did a fantastic job. great movie. one of my favorite actors.the polar express
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Odd and quirky is the simplest review of this movie.  Wes Anderson has certainly captured the sentiments and errant emotions of the adolescent. Certainly worth viewing more than once.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Despite a few interesting moments, this movie is terrible.  The Tony Blair character meets the assistant and falls in love scenario is so truly, epically bad, I cannot contemplate who wrote this.  Forget this and just watch Four Wedding and a Funeral again - you'll be much happier.
B00846REIS|2.0|I bought this book after I read Fifty Shades of Gray. I was looking for something with the same sort of feel. Unfortunately I didnt find it with this title. I found this book to be very boring and underdeveloped. It seemed to be numerous sex scenes tied together with a lackluster and very linear plot. To me, Fifty Shades was much more multi-demensional and it felt more action packed with the romance tying in nicely to the rest of the story. This on the other hand felt like a wanna-be copy cat that didn't quite launch. I won't be reading more from this author.
B00009AOBI|5.0|This movie arrived on time and the condition of the movie was perfect.  The seller is great.  I have always love this movie.  I have not seen this movie since the 1990's.  This movie always touches me.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show tells the story about the heroes which go to war against what most are too afraid to try to understand. Also, it challenges the bond of two brothers which neither heaven or hell can break.  Therefore, I would recommend it to anyone.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Okay, you already know that Homeland is a great TV show.  So read my review of the Amazon video library.<br /><br />I bought the entire season 1 of Homeland via my Kindle Fire.  It is then on Amazon Instant Video &#62; Your Video Library.  So whenever we want to watch an episode, I pick-up my Kindle Fire, open the web browser, chose the Amazon Your Video Library bookmark, chose the episode we want to watch, and designate where we want ot watch it (Kindle Fire or Tivo).  Within minutes we're watching.<br /><br />It's very easy to use.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|A fast read. If you are big into fantasy it's like being home again. Drizzt will warm your heart with his passion for a better life than the harsh wickedness of his homeland.
B000000LZV|5.0|When people think of 1980's underground scene...they think Black Flag, Bad Brains, Minor Threat or Husker Du. But Minutemen were the actual only band that mattered.

1567184855|5.0|I have read this book twice and read a few pages every now and then. A very insightful book that had a healing effect for me. It helped to give a perspective of some of the unanswered questions in life. Sometimes even a perspective goes a long way to bring closure or an eye opener for anything new or revised in life.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I wish it had been even longer. Loved the spoilers if you needed them. Would recommend this game.  I didn't have any glitches.
B005KMX866|5.0|He has captured the feel, sound and of course music from that Sun Records days. He even through in a couple of songs he has written that have the same feel. Buy it and drift back to the 50's RockaBilly.
6304698623|5.0|It's a great father daughter movie.<br />Just bought it on dvd (vs. the wornout vhs) for my now grown daughter.<br />Great cinematography.<br />Don't forget the popcorn!
1469984202|5.0|Seriously, I haven't been drawn into a world like this since I read 'Hyperion' back in the day. The viceral connection to the characters, the over turning of my expectations, loved it. Maybe Bernard could be a little less villain-y, with less moustache twirling, and indeed by the end he is much more fleshed out and you can at least see his point of view. I just found Howey, and now I'm kind of upset he didn't get a Nebula nomination last year.
1936608618|5.0|I hold Brian in the highest regard as a coach. The CrossFit Endurance program has challenged and rewrote the way we approach classic endurance training. More objectively, CFE has renewed my athletic potential as a runner while adding muscle, strength, power and speed. To say that I have benefited from his program would be an understatement. Not many Division I athletes can claim that they are faster and stronger now than when they competed in college. To put in perspective, collegiate racing weight was around 160. While competing in 2011 (while only running less than 30 miles per week), racing weight was 178. My personal best for the year with sub-par training regiment and a foot injury was 1:49.1. My SB (season best) while a senior at Georgia Tech was 1:50.59.    I originally met Brian at a Level 1 CF Endurance seminar while a coach at CrossFit Atlanta in 2008. His coaching methodology on proper running mechanics was literally the first I had been exposed to, which is a ludicrious thought considering I've competed at the highest level of track and field. Because of this introduction, I quickly learned the \\"why's\\" behind my innumerable running injuries, particularly with my feet (plantar fascitis). What became of it was a brief stint as a CrossFit Endurance coach and the opportunity to sharpen my ability on coaching the proper technique of running. Running was to be approached as a skill, much like any other complex movement (snatch, clean, muscle up, etc).    To say that I would recommend this book is an understatement. It is a completely thorough undertaking of movement, programming (endurance, strength, classic approaches, etc) and philosophy that is just not possible to find in one source anywhere else. Lots of time, blood, sweat and tears went into making this masterpiece. My only wish is that it had a section on rowing! But then again, you have to leave something for Volume II ;) With the holidays just around the corner, \\"Power, Speed, Endurance\\" would make anawesome gift for the beginner or seasoned athlete. From workouts to form maintenance, there's something inside for everyone. Read full review here: [...]

It's the only thing I can really say about Wool.<br /><br />Hugh Howey paints a vivid picture of a world that is so stark, it's deadly. What started out as a rather in-your-face world builder and character developer (Books 1-3) of which I thoroughly enjoyed, turned into something I truly didn't believe it could.<br /><br />*I'm getting ahead of myself here... wait for it*<br /><br />Books 1-3<br />Have you ever found yourself reading a book and wondering what the colour of the grout is in between the tiles in the bathroom the protagonist just walked into? Well, guess what?! Hugh has provided an intensely intricate picture of his world, it's full of bursting-from-the-seams description. The great thing, however, is I didn't feel like he'd simply listed each item in the silo, he gave you the information almost by osmosis. It seemed to seep into my brain through my eyes as I read about the simultaneously exciting and scary situations the characters found themselves.<br /><br />I liked book 1, I LOVED book 2 and my love for this series of books just grew from there. I loved that they were short enough to be short, sharp and easily digested, but long enough to draw you in before slowly devouring you. Hugh is a master of intrigue and threw plot twists in that, while you could see them coming, you didn't know how you ended up there.<br /><br />I felt that books 1-3 were your primer. They introduced you to the characters, they thrust the life that they lived onto you and forced you to see it in all it's simplicity and complication. You saw the structure and the method behind the happenings, and also the dangers lurking just below the surface.<br /><br />Books 4 and 5 are a completely different matter.<br /><br />I seriously can not tell you much about these books without ruining some sort of plot point or surprise. It's just too much! I don't think I'll ever be the same after the nail-biting goodness that is Hugh Howey's Wool.<br /><br />The characters are real, living and breathing inside of your head, the antagonists are sneering and manically laughing in the dark recesses of your mind and you find yourself getting lost in the sheer realness of the writing.<br /><br />I think I went partially insane while reading this book.<br /><br />Be warned: Wool is not a little something to pick up. It has teeth and will bite you with its razor sharp fangs and will not let go until you have ridden its wicked tale until the end.ity and complication.

Sometimes I was trying to understand what was going on, other times it was crystal clear...just like seeing a cloud....sometimes wispy stratus, other times a big cumulus. I found it interesting to try and find my way.  Best read in a while.

0385342063|4.0|To put this review in context, I should state - up front - that I am that rare Kinsella reader who hates the \\"Shopoholic\\" books. My favorite Kinsella book is \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" and I really enjoyed \\"Remember Me\\".<br /><br />To me, this book read more like those two books, so I enjoyed it immensely. I'd rate this one third behind those two, though. I felt Poppy's character was more reminiscent of the main character in the Shopoholic books. (Who is, imo, one of the worst popular fictional characters to exist in contemporary chick-lit.) However, there was something endearing about Poppy's character that kept me from disliking her outright the way I dislike the Shopoholic character. While there were times I wanted to smack Poppy upside the head from time to time, I didn't find her actions repulsive. While I would never have behaved the way she did, I could still understand why Poppy would behave as she did given the background Kinsella gave her.<br /><br />If I have a quibble, it's that it appeared as though Poppy did not have much growth or learn many lessons from her actions. There were times she crossed the line with Sam (the hero) and I felt that it was swept under the rug and Sam's end response was, \\"Oh, you're adorable, so it's OK!\\" No, it should have not been that way. She should have apologized in many instances and the outcome should NOT have been so easy on her. It just seemed wildly out of character for Sam (from what we could tell of him) to be OK with some of the decisions she made on his behalf.<br /><br />Secondly, I did not like how the plot with the fianc&eacute; was handled. I understand that Kinsella needed to give Poppy her HEA with Sam, but I thought she handled it in a way where it was too easy for Poppy to walk away from that relationship. The book begins with Poppy thinking she's in love with this guy and she's about to marry him a couple of weeks. To have her go from THAT level of commitment to being into another guy was kind of jolting. Poppy did not have doubts until something happens to FORCE her to have doubts. What if those things didn't happen? Would Poppy even have questioned what she was doing and would she have had the strength of character to realize she was making a mistake? It didn't seem that way in the end.<br /><br />I also would have liked to have seen Sam and Poppy together. The ending is rather abrupt. I know the HEA is implied in most of these sorts of books, but in this case, I would have liked to have seen Poppy meet Sam's family and vice versa.<br /><br />I know some folks didn't enjoy the footnotes, but I thought they were hilarious. In particular the first one: \\"So. This is my footnote about footnotes.\\" It may be because I work in academia and my husband and father are both professors, but I found the entire depiction of academics (which tied into the footnote joke) quite hilarious and realistic in a lot of ways.<br /><br />Overall, it was a fun read. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to enjoy a breezy and engaging chick-lit on a lazy, rainy afternoon.d not have doubts until something happens to FORCE her to have doubts.

B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|The sessions is an amazing movie, based on the inspiring life story of Mark O'Brien particularly his article \\"On seeing a sex surrogate\\". John Hawkes's performance is pretty close to perfect i would say, if you compare it to actual videos of Mark O'Brien. they almost sound the same, it is amazing. helen hunt and William Macy are also great. it is a really funny movie if you are into dry humor (i seemed to be the only one laughing in the theatre most times). Enjoy!!!
B001QWBM62|5.0|As many have stated, this is a good affordable field recorder.<br />I have used it for studio and field work, syncing the files to video manually in Audition.<br />I prefer 96/24 and use the 120 mic positions for ambient field recording.<br />The 2gb file limit is just over 1hr 2min for stereo 96/24 settings, thus a 32gb card is good for 15+ hrs.<br />Made my own shockmount and dead kitten for it.<br />Works great.

We were able to adjust the assembling to by pass the missing piece.  The Star Wars kits we have purchased are very sturdy once assembled.  But the missing piece is an issue.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|So I guess I'm wierd, but I really liked this movie.  The cinematic action sequences (even though performed by scantily clad women) were well choreagraphed, and digital effects were flawless (in a graphic-novel sort of rendering).  The underlying message in the plot went well with the movie.  Blu Ray features are worth the price.  I got this last year at a blow-out christmas price, so I couldn't pass it up.

Driving in my car, I kept the windows up listening to this as I was<br />embarrassed that someone should hear what was playing in my car.<br />Maybe Fagen is too old to try something new, but this junk is just him masturbating to tunes made long past..<br />Get a new copy of the old Aja album instead of this junk. It's much more satisfying.

141694737X|3.0|As a soon-to-be mom, I've started building our baby book library.  This one came so highly recommended that I purchased it thinking that thirty years of sales must mean something!  There's nothing wrong with the physical book, in fact, I find the lifting of flaps to reveal an animal without its name to be a helpful developmental tool.  It's a bit of its content that I don't agree with.  The Zoo sends the child a snake, but it's too scary so the child sends it back.  I don't want to program my child to think snakes are scary.  Am I a snake person?  No, and I don't really want my child to be, but I don't want to take away that option.  Snakes are dangerous, but not any scarier than lions, elephants, etc. which also get sent to the child in the book.  The other thing is that in the end, the zoo sends a puppy.  Which is fine and dandy and all unless you aren't a dog person.  Sure, call me picky.  It's fine.  I just wish I would have picked this up in a store and read it to see those things before I bought it, so I thought I'd point them out here in case anyone else sees things the way I do.<br /><br />I plan to alter the book.  Scary will change to slithery.  Puppy pic will change to kitty pic.  And then it will be fine.
0316228532|5.0|This is a wonderful story--despite some of these reviews.  You must have the patience to allow the Author to develop all of the Characters--this is what ultimately makes it such a wonderful tale.  As Ms. Rowling did with the Harry Potter series-she introduces you in great detail to each important character, and she has done the same with \\"A Casual Vacancy\\".  I know that I began to wane a bit as well in the first part of the book--but don't give up because once you know everyone and their role in the entire story-it is so very worth it.  Parminder, and Fats, and Andy,Tessa, Samantha, Howard--and Krystal, they all must be introduced to the reader so you understand what's to come.  The story really takes off halfway through and it becomes the \\"book you can't put down\\".  The ending is fascinating--how all the different personalities and actions people took affect the outcome is, well, real life.  And the small town aspect of it is very true.  I think Ms. Rowling did a wonderful job as always with this story-she is truly a gifted writer and I can't wait for her next novel to come out!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book. Great story, well written, very descriptive.<br />Highly recommended, even for non-police or military readers.<br />Congrats for the author!
1451695187|5.0|Well worth reading. I finished this book in one afternoon as I couldn't put it down. Its basically a story of a physician's journey into the spiritual plane of the otherworld and back while near death in a septic coma and how that experience has changed his worldview.  I've never had an NDE but I've had mystical experiences and it gives me joy to have more evidence that our consciousness continues after death. This book doesn't conform to the biblical description of what heaven is like, so the title may be misleading for Christians. This book is well suited for people interested in consciousness subjects {e.g. NDEs, astral projection, sensory deprivation...) and transpersonal experiences and may help people see above materialism and scientific reductionism. Hopefully it will help alter our collective behavior as a society for the better if more people realize that there is more to our life that this short time on earth.
B0053KWDES|4.0|This is a great little amp! I was more than pleasantly surprised after plugging my ATH-M50s into this. I wasn't expecting much improvement due to the headphones low impedance BUT this little amp makes a HUGE difference. It's great with an Ipod Classic and a line out adapter. It's much LOUDER and MUCH MUCH cleaner with the adapter. No more low quality mp3s for me. AAC or lossless only. If you're buying an amp like this, then you'll also purchase the line out adapter too. I'm really satisfied with my purchase and I'm hoping it will last a long time. It's worth every penny when used with the Audio Technica ATH-M50s and a relatively clean source. Deducting one star though due to the inability to use amp while it's charging. Nobody wants to stop listening to music... when it sounds this good.... to charge the amp or change batteries.

B00499K9E0|5.0|I watched both seasons twice before I wrote this review and it was easy to watch them twice.  If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan, you probably know a lot about the stories, so this modernization allows you a fresh go at the mysteries.  The first time I was thrilled by how well it was done, while the second time I watched it for content.<br /><br />There is a lot to recommend the show.  First off, the casting is excellent!  Both Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman own the roles!  It's completely different from the Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law Sherlock franchise, which I also enjoy.  Still, I would have to say that this Sherlock is better.  Even knowing certain plot lines, I am mesmerized by Holmes' explanations about how he figures things out and am surprised and entertained by these shows.<br /><br />Definitely not a boring British show!!
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Those of us that can identify with the subject, this romantic comedy<br />is smart, witty and hits close to home.

0984999302|5.0|This book  takes Blank's Four Steps to the Epiphany and puts it into far more readable and usable form.  I'm likely to use this in the entrepreneurship classes that I teach.
B002SR3T10|5.0|My son-in-law is a not a big fan of Christmas music, however he does love Jethro Tull as do I. We ordered this for him and he really really likes it. It is very good, with a good mix of music.

B009FZFONO|5.0|If you love zombie and post apocalyptic TV shows you should really love this series. The zombies are great and realistic. The territorial fighting with the survivors shows the sad state of human nature.The story-lines are riveting. You are always waiting for the next episode.

B000LTAY1U|4.0|I really like this new watch. The band (green canvas) is very stylish and the face of the watch looks very cool. I love that the date and day is included on the face of the watch too! The technology of never requiring a battery is way cool too. I'm a big fan of that concept, as I hate getting new batteries in watches. It's time-consuming and I always forget to do it.<br /><br />The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is there doesn't seem to be any way to keep an eye on how much &#34;power&#34; has been reserved. It seems like if you don't wear the watch for a day, then the watch dies and needs to be reset. Not a big deal in this &#34;my phone is my life&#34; world where you can always get the proper time and re-set the watch in a few seconds. But I thought it was worth noting: if you don't wear the watch for a day or so, the time will be wrong until you set it.<br /><br />Enjoy!1
1476719071|5.0|I need to start seeing a shrink. Why? Because I'm crying. Why? Because I just finished this book, I didn't want it to end, and I just fell in love with a fictional book character. I'm seriously in love with Travis, or the idea of him anyways. If Jamie would write a book about him and Abby everyday for the rest of my life, I would live my life through those books..Never leaving the house.<br />I read alot of books, but I rarely find ones that I absolutely LOVE like I do this one. Before I read this book, Richelle Mead was my favorite author..Now she's my second. In The vampire academy books, Richelle waits until the end of the series to finally get the main love interests together, and theres always a bunch of other stuff going on and not enough interaction between the two people that I want to be reading about. I love this book so much because it's not like that. It's ALL about the relationship between Travis and Abby, and theres talk about Travis on every page :)<br />Jamie is such an fantastic writer. AMAZING at love scenes, and the interaction between the characters. So many times I was found fanning my face with my kindle and smileing like an idiot. I finished this book in a day, even though I tried to slow it down because I didn't want it to end..but I just couldn't. When I wasn't reading it, I had this nervous feeling in my stomache and I just had to pick it up again. Like I said, I think I need a shrink! I cannot wait for Walking Disaster to come out! PLEASE Jamie, I'm BEGGING you, write more books about Travis and Abby! I'm going to go reread it now!

0439023513|5.0|My niece read the first two books, and was so excited to receive the book.  I had never been able to get her interested in reading until these Suzanne Collins books were published.  She is 13 and I am so happy to have turned her into a &#34;reader&#34;.  Great Book!

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy is again ahead of the curve in not only giving us a detailed plausible security threat, but also explaining it so we can understand it.  You can completely visualize this happening.<br /><br />I am an extremely fast reader, but I took my time with this one, about 20 hours spread over 5 days.  I needed that long to take everything in and overall I really enjoyed this book.  I have missed Sr., he is what got me into this series, and it is hard switching over to Jr.  or at least it was.<br /><br />Jr is maturing and becoming smarter. I was 16 when I started reading with Patriot Games and then I read every single book. I became disenfranchised when we got Red Rabbit in 02.  Then we got Jr and Dom and it took me awhile to warm up to them, they seemed to young and naive.  Now the new had rubbed off and they are good agents.  The action was fairly non stop in this, there was something going all the time.<br /><br />I loved being walked through the cyber element as I am interested in it, but don't know a ton.  It was well laid out so you could follow it.  I also liked the way all the story lines intersected.<br /><br />This is a good book and I am looking forward to the next one.  I will re-read this, but it is not a FAVORITE of the series.  My go to TC books that I re-read all the time are: Patriot Games, Sum of All Fears, Debt of Honor and Executive Orders and Rainbow Six.<br /><br />Based on the way the characters are developing I think the next one could be a 5 plus star.  The last few books have been more plot driven and this one was to a large extent, but there was also some good character development, which are the books I prefer.  I hope as Jack Jr gets older his character will be more developed and he will be more interesting.<br /><br />I think the hardest part for me in this book is to realize the characters I grew up loving are now senior citizens :(.  John is repeatedly referred to as old, and you get that impression with SR too.  It was kind of depressing.  Ding is in his 40's - wow!<br /><br />If you are a Tom Clancy fan you should like this book.  I think this book could be read with out all the back history, although that and all the interlocking relationships make it better, you can still come into it without that.  If anything it will make you want to go  back and read earlier works.essing.  Ding is in his 40's - wow!<br /><br />If you are a Tom Clancy fan you should like this book.

B007ZBWJXI|3.0|Strong performances from a group of seasoned professionals of the highest ranking.  The weak points were contained in the songs...just not as creative and well arranged as what they have done previously. Still a strong album with a great production that sounds best loud!

B000001F7R|5.0|This was the only Def Leppard album when I started listening to them. The High N Dry album was great too. Both albums had Pete Willis who wrote great songs but wasn't in the band when they hit it big on MTV when Pyromania came out. The first two albums remain my favorites. This album is their best IMO.
0553378384|2.0|I bought this book as it was recommended by an Astrologer I was taking a class from and to describe in more detail the importance of ones north node in ones chart.  While the author has some general insights a lot of what she says is not even close to being true.  Furthermore since the basis for her entire writing is her research with clients (obviously all of which have some sort of spirituality and seeking a higher life) she missed the boat on the other 1/2 of the population that doesn't have morals is totally unconscious and how to deal with them.  Furthermore she assumes people are operating from a space of love - so not always the case.  I think the worse part of the books writings is her many references to each nodal groups past lives and how they spent so many being this way or that way and that is not going to work this life time.  None of which can be proven so you'll just have to take her word as gospel which only an idiot would do.  Not only that but if I spent so many life times being another way where exactly was my north node in those lifetimes?  Oh Astrology didn't look at those back then so they didn't come into play.  All and all the book left me with little value, maybe 20% applies but because of her many references to lives I'm not sure I ever lived and even if I did don't care because I have enough to deal with in this one, I'm not inclined to recommend it.  Look within for answers.
1451648537|5.0|The book is a readable history of this man and his work.  The photos add to the impact of the text.  This is a book to pick up and re-read chapters, each with thought-provoking content.  It's a keeper.

B007Q0OV6Q|2.0|#5 had no Lego in it! I thought it had simply fallen into another square so I took the whole thing out of the box but it wasn't there. Very disappointing for the price :(
B0034G4P7G|5.0|You wouldn't think that a movie about a guy who wrote a computer program would sustain your attention for a couple of hours. It does. This is an excellent movie. The acting is top notch. The story of how Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook is interesting enough. How he masterminded the whole thing is equally interesting. It is a really good movie.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I bought this album after primarily listening to their first hit \\"Little talks\\". But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked all the songs on the album and it's one of those albums I can play from beginning to end without skipping any songs (which is pretty uncommon with me).<br /><br />It also has a good \\"feel\\" to it, the music is honest and inspired and I know I'll be listening to it for a very long time
B00280LYIC|5.0|A  great book I really love  it<br />One of the  best books  ever<br />I think most kids that are 11 should read this.
0525953728|5.0|If you like to read stories about the seals and what they do and go through, this is a very good book and well written. Getting to know more of the details that killed bin laden is a must read.  Highly recommend.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|I have this film on SD and there is no comparison Criterion have transformed a great movie into a masterpiece.The clean up does wonders for the large crowd scenes and there are a lot of them. The music and sound overall is stunning throught my Polk's and Pioneer amp.This film most certainly makes the upgrade from a 150&#34;16-9 screen to a 176&#34; 2.35-1 very worth while down here in little New Zealand
0446581356|5.0|I love Bobbi Brown's style and tutorials. She focuses on natural looks that make a statement. Great reference for everyday looks for day/night. Very detailed section on tools. A must have for those looking to advance their skills.

B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Have you ever watched a fight scene so great that it made you stop and replay it?<br />There are more than a few genius fights that take place in [[ASIN:B009ZQJ1G4 Equilibrium]]<br />This is a diamond in the rough...So much was boasted about the Matrix that many people have never even heard of this movie, but it did so much more with a much smaller budget. It even has \\"Nitro\\" from the original \\"American Gladiators\\" in a small part (If you have seen this movie think...\\"Sir I'm going to have to ask you for the keys to your trunk\\" ;-)<br /><br />Watch this and I promis there will be at least one scene  where you will be on the edge of your seat from either suspense, or a deep willingness to have handguns reload themselves from your own sleeves! You will not be disappointed!.<br /><br />***For guys who think they can pull this off: Expert level required***<br />In college I had guys watch this with their significant other and tell them beforehand that this is an Action-ChickFlick where in a world where feelings have been outlawed one man fights for the right to have emotions (And even saves a puppy!) It has about a 75% success rate of actually working when the storyline is framed in that way ;-) Good luck and happy viewing!
B008M0NDOK|5.0|I tried this but don't play these games much but the kids and husband have a lot of fun with it. Looks more comfortable then without.  The accessories that are made for the iPad are awesome.

B0086700CM|5.0|It's very fun because it challging for me. I like that It gives power options which are cool like being invisible and you can get a maginet so that all the coins come to you and I like that. Writen by K.K. 8 years old
0307352145|5.0|I am an ambivert who leans more towards being an introvert.  However, I still found this book to be fascinating.  I think that every introvert should read this book (and quite a few extroverts as well).  It taught me not to be ashamed of my introverted side and to not be so quick to try to be something that I am not (i.e., a full-blown extrovert).  Susan does not try to argue who is better in the introversion vs. extroversion debate, however she does advocate that introverts should be comfortable with who they are in an American society that primarily rewards extroversion.<br /><br />Easy to read and tons of information (e.g., introversion/extroversion in America, advantages of being an introvert, etc.). Highly recommended!
1846683130|3.0|Point made: checklists save lives. And yes, you could probably boil down the lessons to the length of an article. But the book goes beyond simple checklists, making valid points about how we need to revise how we work together in an increasingly complex world.<br /><br />One of the points made in the book is the difficulty in getting people to put down their egos long enough to use the checklists. And even more important for me from a business perspective is the danger of people disengaging because their role is considered secondary or their expertise less valuable than the leader. And when people feel they're not valued, they're only going to do what they're paid to do. From page 103, \\"The most common obstacle to effective teams...is a kind of silent disengagement, the consequence of specialized technicians sticking narrowly to their domains. 'That's not my problem' is possibly the worst thing people can think... .\\"<br /><br />Another critical point is that we need to rethink how we measure results. We get so excited about praising one person's success, but often fail to recognize what it takes to put that person out front. The individual becomes a representation of the brand, but not the reality. We focus so much on the flash, but not on the daily grind. This book is grounding.
0345529057|5.0|All of the books in this series are fantastic!  Granted, I think \\"A Feast for Crows\\" is the low-point out of the current five books, but it is still definitely worth the read. To be honest I don't see how anyone who likes awesome stories in general could rate this set lower than 5 stars.  Great value!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very good quality and even better watching it with no commercials also vert reasonably priced per episode happy with it
0553801473|5.0|I love this book.  Not as good as \\"A Storm of Swords\\" (wide and away seen as the best in the series so far) or even potentially \\"A Clash of Kings\\", but still an awesome book. The book has some high points but feels more like a set-up book than the first three books. Definitely an improvement over \\"A Feast for Crows\\" (also a set-up book, but this book does it MUCH better). Basically, the 4th and 5th books are set-up for the 6th and 7th books, but A Dance with Dragons does the set-up in a great way.<br /><br />I can completely understand why fans are divided over this book but still I think this book is awesome and would recommend it to anyone!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I found the movie be very good. I would rent it again some time. Alot of action and adventure in the movie.
B0099114WO|1.0|Based on the trailers, I was expecting at least SOME comedy and romance, a movie along the lines of [[ASIN:B000N90JG8 Something's Gotta Give]]. An older couple falling in love. I understood the story was an older married couple re-igniting their love. What I got was 100 minutes of sadness and depression and a story about a husband who doesn't give a rats behind about his wife and a miserable wife who can't speak up for what she wants and THEN the agony of Steve Carrell trying to drag out the details of their sex life, favorite positions, favorite sexual acts. At one point his advice to them is for her to perform oral sex on him in the movie theater. I would have turned it off except we were watching it with friends at their house and I think no one wanted to be the first to say they hated it, since I was the one who picked it out at the video store. My video renting priviledges have been revoked according to my husband for picking this movie. LOL! The ONLY saving grace was that it did have a happy ending, but you don't know that until just before the credits roll. Seriously, the only light hearted moments are shown in the trailer which is seriously misleading about this movie.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, don't waste your time or money. It's not a feel good kind of movie that leaves you happy and optomistic of life and love and especially about marriage.

B001H1SVO8|4.0|I would review this product, but it would go against everything that Tyler Durden stands for .... Do not buy this movie, the things you own end up owning you, instead go out meet a person of the opposite sex and do not give authority to those who claim it... including this s***** review .  I would say kind regards, but I am my alter ego right now ...
B005GRF2UK|4.0|watch this version-epic. I do not like that it requires all these words. great but can get better bargain elsewhere

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|So, after perusing Netflix on a very boring day off, I came across the first season of AHS and watched it, in its entirety in 2 days.  I knew the 2nd season was well on its way so began recording episodes on DVR...however I didn't have the patience to wait forever for all the back episodes to record and purchased them on here.  Well worth it!  I'm on episode 4 currently and won't give details away at all.<br />I think everyone needs to know how different this season is from the first!  That's a forewarning.  I'm sure they are linked somehow but i have yet to see it.  This season is far more terrifying in my opinion.  Love love.  And it astonishes me that it is shown on tv and advertised frequently!  Very horrific.  I do have an issue of keeping characters straight on this one, as they were pretty straight foreward on the first.  It may just be my attention issues and nothing to do with the characters in the show.  I highly recommend it!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I love the film and the price I paid for it! This is a well made film with fully developed characters. The director takes you on a wonderful journey. I felt a collage of emotions while I watched this story unfold before my own eyes.. I would recommend this film especially for this price I paid $7.99.

B008U0FJF8|5.0|As a percussionist myself, my drumming teacher from LA once told me how he knew that he'd \\"made it\\" when another sage drummer listened to him play and later said, \\"You have your own thing... your own sound.\\"<br /><br />To him, that was his cherished moment of respected peer validation.<br /><br />When I'm listening to a jazz station and hear signature music symbols via tasty additions of the splash cymbals, I know almost immediately that it's probably Manu Katche that I'm listening to.  His style is distinct... and all his own... and he owns how he plays with grace, verve, taste, and style.<br /><br />Myself, I first became aware of Manu in the early 1990's as Peter Gabriel's drummer.  Then in taking lessons from my LA drumming mentor, he brought me Manu's initial solo release when he came back from a Japan tour, and *he* was seriously impressed.<br /><br />This new solo CD by Manu only raises the bar of the excellence he exudes in so many musical ways, and I highly recommend it.  It's a strong, strong jazz release... and oh yeah, when I've got a fever for splash cymbal, Manu's CD is what I'd prescribe.  ;-)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0073Y7PYK Renegade Recordings]]<br />Happy Listening...<br />Brian Shell
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Ugh.  If Ana blushes or bites her lip again I'M going to slap her.  As the sex lessens in this installment, the plot becomes slightly more interesting as does Ana and Christian's relationship.  However, the writing remains redundant.  Another beach read.
B000AM2L1O|3.0|This is a very small baby doll.It looks cute but it is not as big as u see the picture.It may be good for 1 yr old or 2 yrs old child.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Perhaps it was the fact that I was 7 months pregnant while reading this book, but I was intrigued and disgusted at the same time.  The writing is pretty horrible and plot line predictable but I could stop reading...the whole trilogy.  The sex scenes quickly become redundant, which makes it easier to get through the books once you can stop reading those.  I'd recommend it for a beach read I suppose but no great novel here.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I purchased this since it was inexpensive and I wanted the track &#34;Anything Could Happen.&#34; I enjoyed every song in-between. Ellie Goulding reminds me a bit of Bjork.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|&#34;Grease&#34; is such a great musical.  It's funny, but has catchy songs and entertaining numbers.  The storyline is easy to follow and not boring, at least for me but I love musicals.  The picture is great, as is the sing a long option and other special features.  It was a nice upgrade from my old VHS.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Don't buy this it freases you're kindle fire :( it allso doesn't let you pick up blocks x(<br /> I mean 7.00 dollers for junk don't buy this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series is beautifully written, thoughtfully paced, and edge-of-your-seat exciting. I love it that it's gone on to be a series of movies. The story translates very nicely to movies.
B009C7JS14|1.0|did not come anywhere close to my location. wanted weather for my town, not one many miles away. will delete
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I love this game!!! Can play with a lot of people at one time. i find it challenging and fun!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Once Upon a Time both seasons great.<br />Definitely my favorite TV show, it's amazing how they are able to blend all the fairy tales without make it lose sense, not a easy task.<br />Great actors too.<br />Can't wait for the next chapter, I'm totally hooked LOL!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I normally like to zoom through a book, flipping and speed reading as much as I can.  But I wanted to read every single word of this book.  I even went back and re-read several pages and passages.<br /><br />I do not know what you call this style of writing, I'm not sure there is a catagory for it.  But whatever it is, I LOVED it.<br /><br />Thanks so much.  It's been a long time since I read non-romance and I'm glad I gave it a shot.<br /><br />I also liked having the German people's side of how they suffered too.<br /><br />L.K.Killian
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Although the Japanese version is more intense, this American version<br />Is more enjoyable! Jennifer Lawrence's performance is outstanding. I highly recomend this movie!
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I love it. the story is interesting, each character has his/her own personality. Unpredictable development of the story. i really enjoy it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn seems capture the 'Inside the Beltway' political environment very well.  Especially the Congress.  I've read all Flynn's books and have never been let down.  I had over 32 years with the IC.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I love it. the story is interesting, each character has his/her own personality. Unpredictable development of the story. i really enjoy it.
1452110581|5.0|Great book for cat lovers. It captures the hearts and minds of cats very well... definitely recommend. Laughed out loud at each page.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|I loved the story. The photography was incredible.It was a reasonable movie which made for a good movie night. Thanks
1449410243|5.0|Loved this book and it's take on cats and their mindsets. Got this for DS and DIL for xmas. LOL
B004YOEFG8|5.0|Amazing doesn't begin to describe the quality of this movie. You got to own it to understand what you're missing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok first off.  I read A LOT!  I loved this book.  Some of the sex stuff is unnecessary, but I believe the story is more about how they are trying to please each other, her by trying things that he thinks he needs and him by doing things that make her happy.  If only more marriage (relationships) would take that advice, maybe not so much divorce.<br /><br />The story is a good one, lots of sex - if you don't like it skip over it.  It's not hard to do really.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Grandson loved this...Also got him a transformer to go with the movie. A big hit for any 'transformer' fan. Thanks
B00000G6FN|4.0|This compact disc would have been the best compilation except they didn't include Space Truckin.  Still, well worth the price.
B004EPZ034|2.0|This appears to be a copy that someone made.  I bought this as a gift, so it is still in shrinkwrap, but I held the DVD next to a copy I already own and the cover art looks like it was printed off a home printer.  I am surprised Amazon would sell this as a new DVD.  It clearly is not from the manufacturer.  I don't know yet if it works, as it is still in the wrap.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I love this movie.  I grew up on it and it is my favorite.  There are so many classic lines in the movie that my brothers and I say to each other.  And I love a movie with a happy ending!
1455502626|2.0|This book was WAY too long.  The character, John Corey, is so obnoxious I nearly stopped reading after the tour of the Plum Island facility.  In real life he would not have been allowed to dress that way on the job and would not have been allowed to act so unprofessionally.  His ultimate boss on the island (Max) was a true wimp.  I doubt his superiors in New York would have ignored for very long his lack of response to their contacts.  That was very unrealistic.  I managed to somehow keep reading and started enjoying the book when John met Emma.  However, when he went to New London and beat up the security guy with no repurcussions and then went nuts during the hurricane, leading to the ultimate chase, I nearly threw the book into my fireplace with the burning fire.  The fight with Topin in the ammo magazine was so stupid as to be laughable and when he cut him on the abdomen deliberately and Tobin lived, that was unbelievable.  The entire boat chase was completely unrealistic.  I kept hoping someone else was the killer and all the Tobin focus was just a ruse to keep you reading.  The book was terrible and I won't read another by DeMille.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Enjoyed reading the book.  It is a short read.  Interesting to learn some of the intricacies of the operation.  Would recommend this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is just like minecraft for computers but what's great about this is that you can take it anywhere. but the one thing I couldn't figure out how to blow up TNT in creative mode but overall its a great game
0316228532|2.0|This book is long, and confusing. It switches viewpoints so quickly, and it is difficult to discern who is talking. I would not recommend it. I am an avid reader and am a big fan of JK Rowling, but this was not at all what I was expecting.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Best album in 20+ years.  Another level of musicianship, rarely heard and seldom seen these days.  There are instant genre staples all over this album.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|My grandson is one of the guys, so I found it very interesting and easy to read.  Due to the sensitivity of the subject, I'm sure he had to leave some things out of the book.  Nevertheless, I learned a lot.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I am ex Air Force. Many people fail to realize the tremendous price the then Army Air Corp paid over Germany during WWII. Your chances of dying aboard a bomber was 6 times as great as being on the ground as an infantryman. Only submarines were more dangerous. This is why during my years in the Air Force later we tended to be a bit more cautious. The public would never accept such casualties today. Memphis Belle gives you only a taste of what I look back and call our greatest generation 's sacrifice for our continued freedom. Thank you all for your courage!
B000FA675C|5.0|I would recommend this book to every one it is incredible and crazy good I want to read it again ;)
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Dr. Who introduced us to an alien named Capt. Jack Harkness. As mysterious as the Doctor himself he somehow survived as a companion of Doctors 9 & 10. So Queen Victoria after her brush with the Doctor started a top secret unit to deal with the Alien threats and Torchwood was born. Centuries later Jack became it's hardnosed boss. This is the first television superhero to my knowledge that enjoys the company of Gals,Guys and Aliens. Season one of Torchwood unlike most TV series started out running. And still makes TV movies.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I wod recommend this show to anyone thirteen and over. Its suspenseful and exciting with a little bit of horror. It has all the makings of a great film but im a series. This is why i give it this rating. I dont like the &#34;gaps&#34; in between the scenes because too much transpires without the viewers seeing it. You just have to assume alot has happened but its not hard to figure out. All in all a great series full of anticipaton.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|This would be a great gift to a sci fy lover. Don't waste it on folks who don't like sci fy. I made that mistake last christmas 5 times. They just give them away  unopened.  This DVD is literally magical. Especially the space Titanic.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|This aspires to comic book moviedom, like a Dark Knight, or Spiderman. For a TV show it comes pretty close.
B00028HBKC|4.0|The only reason this is rated 4 not 5 stars is the realism. The crucifiction was ugly and violent. No Jesus Christ movie before this including King of Kings and Jesus of Nazareth really showed just how badly our Lord suffered at the hands of the Romans. Mel Gibson's installment is different from any previous films on the crucifiction. One thing for sure people either loved this movie or hated it. Controversial, judge for yourself at a great price!
0316113506|4.0|This book really captured my attention in the beginning with a very compelling story about the impact of exercise and education.  Unfortunately after that it fell a bit short for me...it was too scientific for my reading.  The ideas, concepts and case studies are great- but I had a tough time getting through the medical details.
B000E41MS6|5.0|They say Christopher Ecceleston was the Sean Connery of Doctor Who's. Definately the darker of  the Doctors. Not a happy guy. A man on a mission. He and Billie Piper were a great duo. BUT Piper and 11th. Doctor David Tennant was magic. Still we meet the enigmatic Capt. Jack Harkness later of Torchwood during this series. Therefore logic dictates you gotta have this series. Christopher appeared as the villan in G.I. Joe. Will he return to join Matt Smith in the Dr. Who 50 year anniversary ? Imagine the last 3 Doctors together.
B007HGPBRC|3.0|So the author writes well and this was an interesting perspective on the impacts of fatal cancer.  However, the price of the book was rather high (Kindle version) for the length of the read.  Almost rated it 2 stars, which would mean I didn't like it - upgraded to 3 stars.  It was okay - that pretty much sums it up; it was just okay.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Let the controversy begin. Yeah I said it. Matt Smith the 11th. Doctor is the best Doctor Who ever! The Complete Fifth Series is the proof.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read the series at a friend's request and glad I did. I loved the story. It was thrilling and exciting. You can't help but become a part of the characters lives. I would recommend this book to any age.
6305882592|5.0|Talk about a classic movie way ahead of it's time! This one is not for the kiddies at all. It is as weird as it gets. With one of the finest actresses hollywood has EVER produced, the late great Ruth Gordon. At her very best.This is definately a 5 star movie. A cult classic. Bud Cort is superb as the quirky Harold. A kid more in love with death than life who meets a senior female free spirit totally in love with living life!
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|There was virtually no plot and a lot of voice-overs.  The big-name actors didn't help the lack of story.  Pass on this movie.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|I think Daniel Craig is trying to avoid being typecast as 007. Well it helps to have Harrison Ford backing you up.Not a great movie but science fiction fans will be satisfied with the results.
B0084I9QIW|4.0|Much has been said of the quality of this DVD.  While it may not be of the latest digital quality, it certainly does not appear to be a boot-leg and was extremely enjoyable to watch.  Perhaps my player had something to do with the quality, but I don't think so.
B000FC1KBG|4.0|Perfect book for reading during pregnancy. If you're reading it when your baby is several months or years old, you will only find a couple of chapters applicable to you (correction of mistakes). Still, found a lot of good advice and thoughts. Recommend.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Ultraviolet said you could download and watch this item on your IPad.  This is a lie.  The operating software will not let you watch it.  I will only buy movies with digital copy from now on.  I only bought this so I could keep a copy of it on my IPad.  Now that I can't it was a complete waste.
B001AZI1W8|5.0|Such and amazing show honestly felt like I was there in person, it was a great show from beginning to end.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i have been using this app for some months now and it is easy go use and add alarms to. very well done.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Well worth the watch! My husband had been wanting me to see it and I was kinda on the fence about it, but glad we finally watched it! Very intricately and in depth thinking had to have been involved in writing this script!
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|This is a great movie that is good for all ages.  Our daughter is 20 years old and asked for this for X-mas!  It's one of her favorites!
030758836X|2.0|I finished it, so I've got to give it two stars. Should have stopped much earlier. I don't get all the great reviews for this book. Almost everything about it completely stretches credibility. Character motivation: not developed. Nick really gives up his entire life for a baby from his psychopathic wife? I don't think so. Details: not believable (e.g.--Nick and Amy have no money, supposedly, but continue to live well enough. Loose ends: mortgaging Go's house. Posting bail. Etc.).  Police procedure: questionable. E.g.: test diary for age of ink and paper. Arrest Amy for murder of Desi (why does this just slip by?).<br /><br />All-in-all, a book filled with mostly despicable characters and poorly executed plot lines.
B00A2IUDO8|1.0|If there was an option for 1/2 star that would have been better.  I had such high hopes for this movie but it failed miserably.  Don't get me wrong, there are some funny parts.  If you watch the unedited trailer, you are all set, no need to watch the movie.  It was slow and the jokes seemed fragmented.  I'm a huge Family Guy fan and Seth McFarlane fan.  however, the over the top, way too many, shock-humor moments were just way too much.  Too many, too often and honestly, just not funny.  Wahlberg was terrible.  The only good thing about this movie is being able to look at Mila Kunis...that is until I stopped watching 2/3 through.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Different than the normal green arrow in a few aspects but still very excellent show. Definitely worth watching when able to.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I have recorde this movie severaltimes on my DVR. It always gets deleted at some point. I dont shop much outside my home, so it wa easy to find online.
B00122L1GC|5.0|Not quite the masterpiece Violator was, but even the best don't hit a home run every time at bat.  This album is extremely listenable and there's something for all Depeche Mode fans from the \\"Speak & Spell\\" poppers to the gritty \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" neo-goths.  Proud to add this to my music library.
1423124960|5.0|Great Disney Princess stories for my 5 year old daughter who loves to read and loves to be read.  A must have for bed time story book, but great hard cover book that can last for many years to come!
0920668364|5.0|I originally read this book at a family members house.  I couldn't wait to order it to read to my grandchildren.<br />My 6 year old granddaughter has memorized the (song) paragraph that is referenced a number of times in the book. I was surprised that so many people already had this book, loved it, and had somehow passed me by. I have it now !
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|down load, DVD and blu-ray tri-pack for any format need, at a great price!!  This is our family favorite, but can't wait for the new movie this summer!!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Awesome beats, some moving lyrics, all songs are fun to listen to. Hoping they keep putting out good records like this!<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
0061148512|5.0|This was a very well-written book.  Always enjoyed Plath's poetry and this was an insight into<br />her life through fiction.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you were raised in the 80's, or at least enjoyed the era, this is a wonderful book!  Even if you weren't a big fan of 80s music and movies, it has other draws, but you probably won't appreciate this book as much.<br />Its a dystopian future where everyone opts for the utopian Virtual Reality world.  (Note, the following is NOT a spoiler, as it happens very early in the book.)  The creator of this virtual world dies filthy rich, but without an heir.  He has created an Easter Egg hunt within the virtual world; whoever finds the Egg, wins his estate!  The creator was big into 80s pop culture, so all the Easter Egg hunters immerse themselves in it, believing it will help them in their quest.<br /><br />Its a neat sci-fi, adventure story.  I'm glad I bought it.  I will definitely read it again (probably within a year of reading it the first time!), and I plan to buy this book for my dad.  He was born in the late 40s, but I know he enjoyed 80s movies a lot, so I'm sure he'll get a kick out of this book.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|This doesn't work save your $$$$.I should have spent my $ on something that I could use. Every time I want to use camera it will come up that it cannot connect due to error.I have installed and uninstalled 2 times and still have same issue.Disappointing is all I can say.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Swag swag away with the man who was in a few days later this month in the tide of the main reason I rubber and a half hour and the main article in a a few weeks the man in his book is a half the man in the man in his first start to finish a half gout of a a few years ago whined

B0013LKFVO|1.0|Put bulb in 2D Panasonic flashlight. Produced a flood beam. I was testing it against a Dorcy led bulb which produced a spot beam.<br /><br />Put bulb in a 4D Panasonic hand lantern. No light. Retried several times because alinement is a issue with this lantern. Still no light. Then I looked directly at the led and noticed it was glowing white for a second when I turned the light on and off. Put the Dorcy led bulb (4D type) back in and it worked fine.<br /><br />Put bulb back in the 2D flashlight. No light. The led was producing a white glow when turned off. Put the 2D Dorcy led bulb back in and it worked fine.<br /><br />Retried several times in both flashlights. No light, just a white glow for a second.<br /><br />This led bulb is rated to work with 2 to 6 D cells. Worked with 2D cells. Blew with 4D cells.<br /><br />The Dorcy led bulbs are still working fine (spot beam) and only cost about $5 each at amazon.<br /><br />This bulb is going in the trash. Not worth returning or replacing. Dorcy led bulbs win the test hands down.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|One of my faves it was easy to download.  I love the cloud, it makes everything qucik and easy.  Forget about itunes.
0061992860|5.0|This book is so handy and awesome, it has made me start to prepare for natural disasters here. I have now started making a bug out bag with all these survival gear that I have been collecting over time. I would recommend this to anyone that is a survival junkie.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Love this show...  Needed at least 15 more episodes to come full circle.  This is by far the best show that never should have been cancelled.  It's full of wit, humor, adventure, gun fights, etc.  It has it all.  Never a dull moment.  Also has a now very famous director.  Interesting characters from different backgrounds.  All with personalities.  We would have got to know them more if the show wasn't cancelled so soon.  I recommend this show wheather you are a Treckie or not, you will at least like the show.  Don't give up on one or two episodes.  Believe me the more you watch the more you will want to see....
B000W1T1MK|4.0|Don't care what anyone says. This,is a really good rainbow album. Maybe not the best rainbow,still very good. Get it lol.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Cool movie.... a lot fun.  Never had a chance to see in theaters near me.  I had the regular Dvd and was satisfied with the quality.  Now that the price on the Blu-ray version has come way down I had no choice but to buy it.  The picture quality is sharper (not edgy) and the sound more dynamic compared to the regular dvd.  Not night and day difference.  Would be nice to make a sequel but since characters die it wouldn't be the same.  If you like Nathan Fillion you must watch the short lived series Firefly..  Shipping was fast and discs plays as it should.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Great movie. What else is there to say? Long yes but a great movie. Perfect end to the trilogy.good acting great action and effects.
0062124293|5.0|Caitlin Moran is the kind of feminist I want to be: Hilarious, intelligent, bright, vivacious, active, and imperfect. After I read this book I started following her on Twitter and I'm never disappointed to hear what she is up to. She brings a brilliant voice we so desperately need in 2012 about women and our modern relationship with the world/our selves/our sexuality/our families/our communities/and our responsibilities to all of those things. In this book, Moran urges all women to &#34;...counter the awkwardness, disconnect, and bulls*** of being a modern woman not by shouting at it, internalizing it, or squabbling about it--but by simply pointing at it and going 'HA!' instead&#34; (14). A fantastic book and a great gift!!
B000I186FW|5.0|Great movie with a really good story.  The acting is also superb. Would watch this movie many times over again.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I bought this to navigate Second Life and Virtual Worlds scenes for seamless machinima making. It takes a while to get the hang of it, but with practice the 3D navigation experience becomes so much smoother. It worked easily with the applications I use,  and is a thousand times better than using a regular mouse.
B007OUFESC|5.0|I read this for my theories class.  Some of my peers thought it to be disturbing.  I thought it was intriguing.  It really gives insight into the historical figures and their theories.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|I think the game needs more plane like the a-10warthog and the b-17. That would make the game even better.
1423140605|5.0|I really loved this book, Rick Riordan is a wonderful author and incorporates mythology very well in these. As a young adult reader, most series are about supernatural romances, which get cliched quickly. Mr. Riordan mixes humor and adventure extremely well, and his books are great for a range of readers.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Our whole family loved the movie!  We did a movie night with some of the kids friends and we all watched it.  Kids and adults alike enjoyed it.
B005QUQP76|4.0|This mouse is as accurate as you can get in the FPS gaming world. Accuracy will not be an issue if that is your concern.<br /><br />The sniper button is not as far forward as people complain about. It's an idea and if you don't like it you can disable it. I'm 5'8 with medium sized hands and my hands reach the sniper button with ease. I can see people with small hands having issues but if that's the case don't buy this size mouse and give it 2 stars for your lack of research.<br /><br />The software can be a little bit tricky but it seems to be working well now. I have heard of the issues during release but corsair has had time to work on the software and now it is working well, in my opinion.<br /><br />This is not recommended for a claw grip user. Do not buy this mouse and tell the world how bad it is if you are a claw gripper. If you get this mouse, you were warned. So far so good - pros and cons below.<br /><br />Pros:<br />I love the feel. Not too heavy, not too light<br />It's accurate<br />It works on smooth surface as well as razer controlled surface. Lift height feature is a plus<br />USB 3.0 recommended but update firmware on USB 2.0<br /><br />Cons:<br />Scroll wheel is smooth but stiff to press in at times<br />Could have been made a little smaller than what it is now but hands fit over mouse just fine
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I you can't see your feeds what's the  point. This should be fixed. I want to use it but it's to frustrating.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This series is awesome and every episode I watch draws me in deeper and deeper.  The show is as addictive as the drug its about. I just started watching it from the very beginning 2 weeks ago and I'm  pretty sure I'll  be buying all the seasons. At 1.99 an episode it's pretty cheap entertainment for me.  I highly recommend it.
B009HELT3C|5.0|It actually seemed better than the first two Films.<br />Plenty if action, Funny, Great computer action Graphics<br /><br />Will probably watch it again
B009PNQUXO|3.0|If you have any trouble with youtube due to Flash player issues this app is really nice to have for your Kindle Fire HD. I've heard and read numerous reasons for YouTube not working with the Fire an d mine is hit or miss, so this app  is  necessary. One issue with it however is the need to restart it while doing a different search. I don't k ow if this issue is due to  to the advertising  or what but it is annoying.
1449410243|5.0|Fantastic Oatmeal-esque comedy, now with more cats! Great book with a free poster; fantastic addition to &#34;Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth&#34;.
