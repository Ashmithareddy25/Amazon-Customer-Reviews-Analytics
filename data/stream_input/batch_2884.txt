B00A3Z3KDG|5.0|The acting in this movie is magnificent, the story is compelling, entertaining, and breath catching. Simply you can recommend it to any one.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This is some thing our whole family sites around and watches together. Great family entertainment, very funny. Wish they made more shows like this!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved how everything tied in at the end.  The characters and their stories were very believable and interesting.  I really could see some people I know in ghese characters
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Makes me talk like a British gentleman. Well written and absolutely smashing acting! Quite the epic. Don't think twice my dear, watch them all. Hear, hear!
B00DP3IESY|3.0|I like Tom Cruise because he always delivers action and usually unique and well-plotted thrillers or sci-fi tales. This one fooled me. While the trailer made my want to watch it, the actual movie made no sense at all. In fact, it was silly. I gave it a 3 based on Tom's past work and the great special effects.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I'm a senior citizen who loves Adele's talent !  I listen to this with my grand daughters ! GREAT cd !
B00CL68BK2|5.0|If this doesn't win the academy award, then something is wrong. Great movie, fell in love with the characters. A tear jerker, yet uplifting. Ending a little unbelievable, but the rest of the movie carries me though it. ,
B003I55BIA|4.0|Young love winning over ethnic pier pressure. High school challenges, fear, chances, and enduring all for love. I couldn't stop reading.
B00CWVFPGO|1.0|Everything about this movie was stilted, unbelievable and incredibly stupid. Sorry I wasted my time.  Don't make the same mistake.
0062255657|5.0|A great novel remeniscent of both Neverwhere and American Gods, a fantastic story that also happens to feature kittens. Highly recommended
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I'll start by saying that I haven't yet read the book (but definitely plan to now) and I understand there are discrepancies, like any book-to-movie. I really enjoyed watching this, and actually watched it twice during my 24-hour rental period. Zombie purists probably won't enjoy a zombie love story, but the idea that giving people (or in this case, the undead) your time, energy, and even love could &#34;bring them back to life&#34; is powerful. While the movie contains plenty of mush, both romantic and actual brain matter, the theme is consistent throughout the movie.<br /><br />I tend to judge movies by their soundtracks as well as plot, etc. and Warm Bodies didn't disappoint at all. Not only were the songs well chosen, but they were well incorporated into scenes. Something I enjoy about a good album, be it compilation or otherwise, is having a few songs I know lead me into songs and artists that are new to me, which is exactly what this soundtrack did. The musical highlight of the movie for me is probably Delta Spirit's &#34;Yamaha&#34; playing as R walks through the rain.<br /><br />TL;DR - take the movie for what it is (a fun, undead flick) and enjoy the music.
1433502410|5.0|When I first received the ESV bible, I was amazed by the size and the additional background of information. Each verse is explained with more verbiage and references that would be compared to a teacher guide. Every Book has several pages which explains the background and the author and time periods.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What's not to love about Downton Abbey? The costumes are stunning and historically accurate. The actors are masterful. And the writing is compelling and heartbreaking.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|It covered a very different view that the public do not knowingly or have an any idea of this problem. The cast was picked with a great deal of thought and they did present the story with the correct feelings. After the nudity was first seen, it seem to be natural for the story.
B0058BI896|5.0|Every character of this t.v. show is funny.  The camaraderie of the characters work so well with one another.  Hilarious!
B004R13U6Y|4.0|It has enabled me to have the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures and Bible reference works on my Kindle.
B00296A4F4|5.0|From the first episode of this show, it has always been fun.  I love the Finn and Rachel angle.  Love Mr. Shuester and Emma's love story as well.  Rachel is just so talented.  I will miss Finn's character and most of all, Cory Monteith (RIP).
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Excellent hack and slash crawler.  There are a lot of taps to get through in order to upgrade but the learning curve is not steep.  Haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I expect it to get even better online.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I like the movie even though me and my friends watched it over a few times and still cannot figure some parts of the plot. Anyway still like this movie a lot.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I am reading this book for the 3 time and it just gets better everytime I read it I love it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was not sure about playing this escape game but I truly liked it. It was challenging but yet not too hard. I don't know why there weren't more levels.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|The actors are bad the script is very bad and there was not to much in the way of a real story do not waste your time watching this
B003ZYJS5Q|5.0|I have the mono cd box set, but for some reason I had to spring for the mono Vinyl. When the vinyl box set arrived I took the LPs out of the holding box, I started with \\"The Times They-Are A Changing\\", I was floored with the not only the sound of the mono but the dead quiet of the vinyl. I swear I thought it was the 1960s again with my turntable spinning these awesome vinyl time capsules. Awesome package, I even bought Mobile fidelity covers to keep the vinyls immaculate. [[ASIN:B001LQSFKY MOBILE FIDELITY - MFSL INNER SLEEVES (PKG 50)]] Planning to burn these vinyls to cds with my computer vinyl software. The 12*12 booklet with notes by Greil Marcus, is a nice addition with rare photos and new liner notes. Beautiful reproduced lp jackets with incredible artwork, incredible attention to detail. I know MP3s are convienent, and most people don't want to bother with cds and vinyl anymore, I say to hell with MP3s \\"yeah for your cell phone MP3s are great, but for listening on a stereo Vinyl or cds are the way to go. These vinyls are an incredible listening experience even not on the best of stereos. Expensive yes but on amazon you could always wait on a cheaper price you might be able to jump on. Bob Dylan 1960s vinyl hot again in the 21 century.....VINYL IS THE WAY BOBBY DYLAN WAS MEANT TO BE HEARD IN THE 1960S, AS HE IS IN 2013 AND WELL INTO THE FUTURE......WOW!!! [[ASIN:B003ZYJS5Q The Original Mono Recordings (Vinyl)]]
B005544TRQ|2.0|Just another predictable, formulaic, &#34;too cool for school and I don't have to follow the rules&#34; show. Not impressed with the premise or the writing. Won't watch again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This program has me hooked for the next season.  I enjoy the acting, the drama, and the little digs from each character.  I cannot wait to see the outcome of Dan Stevens character Matthew Crawley.  Did he really die?  Or will they say he is in a coma?  Hmmm...I wonder????
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a book that I've gone back and read time and time again, ever since the day in my early teens when I picked the book up randomly in a bookstore and sat down in the middle of the aisle, entranced, for a good three hours before I remembered that there was a world around me. The world is unique, fascinating, and mysterious. I'm not usually a fan of books containing themes such as necromancy (surprising, as I love these books), but the way that magic and death are explained are just the right mix of chilling without being overdone and gruesome. Sabriel herself is a strong, no-nonsense female character, and characters such as Mogget and Touchstone are capable, witty, and interesting, adding just a bit of comic relief while still maintaining the underlying thrill of darkness and danger that characterizes this book. I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a fast-paced, thrilling, and dark fantasy read.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|An interesting analysis of the life and times of Jesus, and the centuries preceding and following him. For a scholarly look at the historical Jesus, though, I was a bit surprised by how much of the source material came from the new testament. That wouldn't have been a problem for me apart from the fact that the gospels are not truly historical documents.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season really built a strong story line and filled out the background of the characters. Great acting and drama in this season.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Great movie with a great plot. The movie used a lot of physical props with the CGI making the movement and action scenes flow smoother.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|I've never read such an emotionally challenging and beautiful masterpiece! Be aware that this is not a light hearted or feel-good fantasy series. However the character development in these books are unmatched.
B000MCIBB6|4.0|Waiting for the Sun is a solid offering from The Doors, in that it features a wide variety of music, from pop to rock to psychedelic to progressive and acoustic. While this album isn't their strongest effort, it nonetheless delivers some classics such as HELLO, I LOVE YOU, LOVE STREET, THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER, FIVE TO ONE, NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH, and SPANISH CARAVAN. The rest of the songs are sort of filler, but still pretty good. This album seems to cling to themes of love, protest, and freedom. Lyrically, this is still a great effort from Jim Morrison. Musically, the guys were still in top form. I recommend this album for anyone just getting into The Doors.
B0041EOR9Q|5.0|Raw, vicious, seductive. Versatility at its zenith; from gallic hell to sunny L.A.. Stones' apotheosis has the defying harmony of a Picasso's painting.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Just your average bottle cutter. Not really stable to use as pictured but I made a wooden jig to lay my bottle on while cutting.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book keeps you in your chair.  Not the typical holocaust story, but enough twists to make it interesting and yet still relevant.
B001GMQALY|4.0|Seen this a few times, and it's fun to watch.  Especially looking at Mickey; at least what he USED to look like.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I liked that this show is very real & deals with real issues. The show is also very well cast.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Seen it a thousand times and it never gets old. I would recommend it to everyone; a real cult classic.
0060763280|5.0|First off, I would like to thank Harv for releasing this book. I've been doing exercises and I have to say it's been working for me. This book is worth GOLD!!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Although it deviated from the book, it was not as disappointing as in the book as Peeta gets to keep his leg!!
0156528207|4.0|I bought it used that was suppose to be in \\"like new\\" condition. I paid a grand total of $00.01. Plus $00.43 in tax (which I don't understand) and $3.99 in shipping and handling. So $4.43 I received the book in about two weeks. The book itself was water stained, broken spine with pages following out. Not all that happy with the quality of the book.<br /><br />I was going to just let it all slide, after all \\"I got what I paid for\\". But... I was encouraged to contact the seller, in my case it was \\"Owl Books\\". They apologized for the quality of the book, stating that they try to never send a book in that condition, but it was the last book they had in that title. They IMMEDIATELY refunded my money (including S&H) without having to go through the \\"return\\" process. I received a very genuine email from the manager and additional follow-up email. I will say that my faith in customer service was restored. I promised to revise my review in light of the final outcome being that I would use this seller again.<br /><br />With that all said, I love the story and it is worth having. It had been years since I last read it and was glad I finally had another copy (sad little copy that it is). Which does remind me of that old saying; \\"never judge a book by it's cover\\".<br /><br />As for the story, if you have never read it, I highly recommend it, child and adult a like. Gentle life's lessons, that are never too late to be reminded of and get re-filled with the simple wonders that await everyone.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not as wonderful as the Kite Runner.  There were many interesting short stories in the book.  Some of these stories were mso interesting I mdidn't want them to end.  A few others were not as compelling.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Either there is just something I'm not getting.... but I've been using Google for years and I can't get this app to work.  I un-installed it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small, Effective, and has a lot of options. I place this behind my SOG Multi Tool in its pouch and clip my everyday cary knife to the side. With this combo alone, I can carry about any tool I need, and have a way to maintain them. This works for any type of blade, straight or serrated, and for the small price, is worth its weight in gold when you need it.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|My Grandkids have watched this over and over.  I loved it myself.  Entertaining for all ages.<br />Buy it Now! Well Worth It!
140006922X|4.0|This book appears to be well researched and presents an interesting historical perspective of Jesus and the times in which he lived and the subsequent texts in the New Testament regarding Jesus.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Enjoyed this rich book very much. Love the the writing and the content was riveting. Got a little confused with so many characters but I like it when things are not so spelled out for me-made me think a lot.
B009NNMBCA|5.0|First off, let me start by saying that I am not an obsessed teenage girl writing a review for One Direction. I happen to be much older but I really do love this group and I also fell in love with the movie. I think it was raw and real and it really gave you a look into what happens during their day whether they are working or have a day off. These young men are very talented and humble and also very different from the previous boy groups who have come before. Even if your not a huge fan you should see the movie and not judge because these boys deserve all the fame and success they have through their hard work and dedication.
B008LXZEYU|3.0|It really is amazing how many films there are like this that pander to juvenile humor.  Not my cup of tea.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|We haven't been disappointed by any season in this series. We highly recommend this series and will be sorry to see it end.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|One of the only heroes that I stuck by as a kid, and even into adulthood was Batman. It all boils down to the realism and tragedy behind his story. I grew up with Batman: The Animated Series, and saw the four movie adaptations from the 90s and on. But, there is no movie like this. After watching Batman Begins, I assumed that TDK wouldn't live up to it's predecessor. IT SURPASSED IT. The depth and detail of the characters, the intensity of the action scenes, and even the emotional journey behind the musical score, solidify this Film's place in Comic Book Movie History.<br /><br />I was one of the skeptics when Heath Ledger was cast, and had to swallow my words. The way he delivered The Joker, was better than I could have ever imagined. Every time he was on the screen, he stole the show. Through his deliverance and through Nolan's vision, it was the best portrayal of The Joker I've ever seen! The perfect blend of genius, ruthlessness and insanity!<br /><br />To me, Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne is fantastic. The depth and layers to the Bruce Wayne character is not easy to pull off, but he did a hell of a job! Now, when it comes to the other half of the roll, he does the physical part of the job perfectly, but I can never get over that \\"Batman Voice\\". I know it's Nolan's idea, but I still hate it! Someone get that man a Ri-co-LAAAAA!<br /><br />Prior to this movie, I had never seen Aaron Eckhart's work, but after his portrayal of Harvey Dent, I know him now! Ledger may have stolen the show, but Eckhart's Dent AND Two-Face were both perfect. And it takes a lot for me to say perfect. I would have liked Two-Face to have a bit more screen time, but considering the 2 1/2 Hour run time, they knew what they were doing. The rest of the cast, from Oldman, to Caine to Gyllenhaal, all knocked it out of the park with their respective portrayals.<br /><br />The plot to the movie was awesome, through and through. Smart and complex, yet straightforward when it needed to be. It didn't feel predictable, surprising me on multiple occasions! It was a perfect balance between dialogue and fight scenes, and had many edge of your seat moments. What more can I say? This movie was fantastic when I saw it on opening day, and it still is, years later!'t feel predictable, surprising me on multiple occasions!

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love the free version of this app! Your alarm goes off even if the sound is turned down on your device! This has saved me from being late so many mornings. You can also download your own songs to this app and wake up to your favorite tunes!

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|fun quick and easy to figure out. fun for all ages and timed for a quick game to do during work breaks.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Predictable story but very entertaining and well acted.  I enjoyed it and found it refreshing.<br />I would recommend this movie.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I love this movie and always have...it kind of gets you into the 'Spirit of Christmas'. I remember watching it as a girl and dreaming of Christmas morning.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|Beautiful for 2013 Holiday Season,<br />One more year added to my Collection!<br />Beautiful white Gown .  25th Anniversary<br /><br />Get yours before, there all gone!
B0081336FO|5.0|I loved the season just as much if not more than the first and am anxiously awaiting the third season's arrival.
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Okay. Saturday night, looking for a video to watch. I come across this Killing Season...at a glance I see John Travolta. And Robert De niro...two heavy hitters, right!? I'm like, this is an old movie? No? Well, I 've never even heard of it.! But I've loved every movie these two icons have ever done. So, I watched it....alright, who blew the advertising on this movie!? Now, as a rule I don't review books (too many Einstein's out there) and I rarely review video's because it's just as bad, but this is a cool flick. let me break it down short for you: a group of extremists are killing and torturing people. The UN goes in and stops it. The leaders of the extremists are put to death...but one does not die.<br /><br />  And for eighteen years the survived looks for the man that shot him in the back...<br />  He finds him. And now, he's going hunting.<br /><br />A man lives alone in the mountains (Robert De niro) A recluse trying to forget his horrid past. Be is estranged to bis family be cause of his mental....differences....now, if he shoots an animal, it's with a camera..<br /><br />  All of a sudden, a stranger appears. By chance or no, Robert De niros character picks a lone man up in the rain. He seems harmless enough. He only carries nothing but an ancient long bow, unstrung...feeling sorry for the guy in the pouring rain, he decides to give the guy shelter for the night. Thay have a nice supper together. A hunt is planned for the morrow....well the next day De niro finds out the hard way who this guy is.<br />  The hunt is on. Graphic. Some gruesome stuff. And the ending had me clapping at the end.<br />......I just don't know why this movie was so....understated. Great movie.
B00499NHLC|5.0|love watching this addicting, extremely catchy show. the dynamic between the characters is scintillating and you will love watching their relationship unfold.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Good game chandelling .At first I couldn't understand how to play the game .Now I loved trying to win, I play over and over again.
B001I9B9I4|5.0|I love this movie.  I really like the story line.  I think Marcus is a really great actor. I would love to know when the sequel will come out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just got this app yesterday and im already obsessed with the game.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes to play cards. Whether this review helps you or not, in just stating the facts and my opinion....
B005NFJAT4|5.0|I am a civil war buff and love this movie. I have done Civil War reenacting and actually know a few people in this movie

B000000P17|5.0|About the purchase, excellent price, delivery time, and the conditions of the product. This CD from my point of view is the last best record in the Guns and Roses career, for those who like good hard rock it's amazing. Check the site to find more Guns and Roses records.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|One of the few kids shows that doesn't annoy the heck out of me. It's entertaining, funny, clean and frequently has lessons I can point out to my kids. I can't wait for Season 3 COME ON AMAZON! And the FULL FEATURE LENGTH MOVIE in a year or two!
B000002LIM|5.0|About the purchase, excellent price, delivery time, and the conditions of the product. This CD from my point of view is the best score of all Batman movies. Check the site to find more movie records.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Ah.  Brings back memories of the good old days when production was fun (but not the pretty hair!).  Well done.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Read this book over the weekend with [[ASIN:B00EPWDYRA Heartbreak for Dinner: It's Kind of a Long Story]] and was thrilled to love both. I like my books to surprise me and take me to places I wasn't expecting, and both did just so. Good fun reads for a weekend with no plans.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|my kids love the star wars saga, with excellent quality of video and sound and great presentation!<br />good price also
B008J05EL8|1.0|Installed it, reinstalled several times. Nothing. Total waste of money. I'm a big user of Amazon and generally very pleased. However, my Kindle 4G isn't working as it should, this app among the things not working as expected. Maybe it's the luck of the draw.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink is truely awesome.  Her songs can relate to many people and what goes on in their lives.  Yeah sometimes the words are tuff but hey it gets points across.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|The acting is superb, and the setting is wonderfully developed. The question of what actually happened to the detective before he came on the scene creates suspense.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This movie paints a bleak picture of a future divided country where the rebel districts must provide human tributes every year to fight to the death. Makes one ponder if this is the direction America is heading...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Mr. DeMille gets it right. If my wife knew what went on in my head, I'd be bruised all the time...If you don't know what I mean, read this series of books. The author tells wonderful stories with an outstanding humor. I keep turning the page to see the next wise-crack. Hope it's not too long before the next book comes out.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Watch as the world's most evil person gets tamed by three young girls he adopts to help him commit his despicable crimes. Touching story with many laughs.

B00B2PHSIY|3.0|This filter really enhanced my underwater video, and its easy to snap on and off the Go-pro.  But it's cheap plastic and it has already cracked after just one week of using it on a dive vacation. If you buy this, keep it separate from the camera while traveling because the camera and its case is a lot sturdier than this lens filter.

B00CL66FEQ|3.0|This was nicely done and well written and acted.  I would recommend for a laid back funny type movie.  If you're a mom, you can really relate!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This was fun even for me, and I am 15.<br />You get to do all kinds of things and it is sort of like a real hair salon.<br />The only reason it is four star is because after a little while, it gets a bit<br />Repetitive. If you have a big imagination then that's no problem.<br />It is a bit pricey for the what you get though, but that (thankfully) does not apply to me becauase it was the app of the day!<br />Overall, great games, especially for little kids with big minds.
B00006NSGX|4.0|I am very pleased with the CD...was not aware that it was a double CD when I ordered it.  of course I was thrilled to find that out.  The main reason I wanted it, because it has Over the Rainbow  on it....my all time favorite song.  I have about 5 or 6 Cd with this song. Different artists with their own renditions.....Thanks1
B00CCX9DUG|5.0|Brilliant as are all her books. Brings history to life in preTudor times. learnt heaps!  Hard to put down.  Absolutely fascinating dealing with the princes missing from the Tower
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|This movie is completely different from the first.  I don't know what the body count was for this movie was, but I'm sure it was way more than the first one. If you like gratuitous violence, this movie has it.
0439023521|5.0|This is a great book for teens and adults alike. Never a dull moment, the characters are interesting and captivating. The issues of family, friendships, government excessiveness and social norms are easily relatable to modern day readers. The whole trilogy is powerful, touching and well worth reading.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|This movie has almost nothing to do with Max Brooks' book.<br /><br />But it isn't a bad movie and certainly it is very far from the natural disaster everybody expected. It is a bit predictable but it also has a few surprises. Brad Pitt is the main reason most people gave it a chance but the actual plot didn't let us down by being actually watchable.<br /><br />I enjoyed it. It is surprisingly good for a PG-13 Zombie movie.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The allegoric quality carries the narrative with charm and simplicity as it describes the universal quest of the soul on its journey.  The tale reminds me of The Little Prince in that respect.  I greatly enjoyed the experience of reading this lovely story.
B005LAIH54|3.0|I didn't see the first movie but watched this one in theaters. You miss a few plot points for not watching the first part but this movie works independently of it.<br /><br />It has interesting locations, cool effects and creature designs and the actors aren't bad. The plot is somewhat interesting but it only serves to put the action in motion.<br /><br />A nonstop action romp that isn't a classic but is enjoyable. A good popcorn movie for an evening or night with friends.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I have never read a Harry Potter book, so I can be objective and make no comparisons. Plot kept my interest.  Good character development and interesting ties between the characters. Gave new meaning to &#34;living and dying by our actions and decisions.&#34;. The last few pages left a bit to be desired.  Felt like a quick wrap up and could have been better structured.
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|Not as good as I thought I could be but way better than a sequel usually is.<br /><br />We laughed a lot when we saw it on the theater; it has soul, is funny and has good production values. Some scenes can be a little bit risqué for the smaller ones but nothing to worry about.<br /><br />The Twinkles with arms and legs, aka the Minions, stole the show again. No wonder they are releasing a prequel featuring them as the main protagonists next year.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I purchased this album on a whim one month when Amazon had it priced at $5 since it got some good reviews. I then let it sit in my collection for a while, not having any idea what was waiting for me when I finally got around to listening to alt-J for the first time. To be honest I didn't immediately love them. It was different, I'll give them that. The second time through I listened more closely and realized that there was some pretty good stuff here. The third and fourth time around, I really started to love what I was hearing. The combination of vocals, instruments, and electronics is not like anything else out there. And the range of different sounds and feelings is incredible. I don't have much more to say that hasn't already been said. New music doesn't get much better than this. I've been listening to Awesome Wave for probably more than six months now and it hasn't come close to wearing off its new smell yet. Can't wait for the encore.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Kept my attention throughout the whole movie.  this is all I have to say about this movie.  Don t have time for more remarks.
B0084ANCBC|4.0|This book is a social commentary on the life in the early 1800s.  Society's rules are rigid and social climbers are not looked upon with favor.  Poverty is deemed a personal fault as well as a social stigma.  Becky Sharp is a clever girl who gets her way but ultimately gets ground down by society.  She proves herself to be more than a schemer but is not able to achieve the socal status she craves.<br /><br />Her friend Amelia, as clueless as she can be is ultimately saved from a life of unhappiness through Becky's intervention. Lots of subplots, deviousness, snobbishness, manipulation etc.  Life hasn't changed too much. Money is still power, however in those days the upper class could live a long time on credit and their name.  Thackeray is none too subtle as to his contempt for social classes and the power they have over the lower classes.  I recommend this and then see the movie with Reese Witherspoon.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This game is not only fun, but interesting.  Can't wait until sequel game is offered!!  My husband and I have this game on each of our Kindles.  We bought have an enjoyable time with this hidden object game.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|I love this show! Great acting and writing. Story is great. It's no breaking bad but its one of the best half hour shows.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|my son is 8 and loves this game.  paid for it with his own money and doesn't want to put it down.  so that's a problem for me but he is happy.
B001AT4Y84|4.0|This movie is really underrated.  It gets a lot of bad reviews by being comparedI to T2, but Arnold looks great and I really liked the story line.  Lots of cool action.  I enjoy this movie and will definetely watch it again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What can I say about Downton Abbey that hasn't already been stated? I highly recommend this series! (and I can't wait for the next installment).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is tons of fun and very addictive. I play it almost everyday and my children love seeing the minions. The only downside is the cost of some items, which are a bit expensive.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Story was very good.  Acting great!  Action, Action, Action!  Film well done.  Movie was fun from the first frame.  Looking forward to the next Thor movie!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very intense. Captured the emotions. Felt wrapped up in the events as they took place.  Very easy to read but very hard to put down.
1439152810|4.0|First off, I confess I have not read anything else by Morton. As an author, though, I leap to the one-star ratings, an evil habit. I do not agree that the book was poorly written, nor that it was padded. Sure, it wasn't up to the economy of a Hemingway or Steinbeck, but what is?<br />The storyline kept me reading. For me that's a huge plus. The point of view slipped easily between Dorothy and her daughter and Jimmy. The others characters were not as developed, but they were certainly not cardboard. I can still hear Jimmy's dad interacting with his bird and the old lady crabbing about her toenails.<br />Yes, there were misleading plotlines, as in Vivien not being able to have children, in her own words, but if \\"I can't\\" meant \\"I dare not\\" because of my situation.......such an ambiguity is permitted. The complexity about \\"who got the money\\" is one of the reasons I went four star.<br /><br />No one is pickier than another author. I give this one two-thumbs up.
1451695187|4.0|Heck of a story, got a little weary with all the technical Medical terms but thats just me.  I would recommend this book.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|The best..... love animal stories that tug at your heartstrings with the human element involved.  It was great to watch also because  it was free of ... language....gore etc. ....all of it was implied and done with very little of the gross factor.<br />  Thank you...Steven Spielberg... we need more of these to bring us all back and help us to learn respect for all living things.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I enjoyed watching it just waiting for season 3 to become availible on Amazon Prime. I hope it doesnt take long.
B0026Q8F6C|5.0|One of the funniest movies ever, South Park is always edgy, funny and relevant. This didn't disappoint! I wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers but if you love the show this movie is for you.
B0026KX5PO|5.0|very intense and mysterious love it a great movie and the cast is amazing they really take you into the drama and suspense.
B00BZAZVV2|3.0|It was an okay film. I not mad that I watched it. I was a little surprised that so many people feel as though it is a classic. I felt that the production value was really kind of low and the editing was terrible. The story was interesting but  enough because it showed a glimpse of what the 60's counter culture was like. And I assume it was accurate because people that spent their formative years in the 60's seem to enjoy this film. Over all I can just say that it was just okay.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am about half way through this book and it has surprised me a couple of times which I enjoy. The language is a bit rough, but overall I have to say that I am enjoying it,
B002361MLA|5.0|This book has helped me to see that the peace I want is always here in the Now! I really experienced it, and I love it! Thanks Eckhart!
B00821OX98|5.0|Good acting and live the suspense to keep you going until the next show. Look for more shows that will come.
B00CATONCA|4.0|I gave it 4 stars just because I one the walking dead show. However the screw on the bottom of the tank was turned too tight when assembled, this in turn caused me to strip the screw trying to get it out. I had to use a tiny drill to get the screw out and get to the battery compartment. Luckily I didn't damage the tanks or casing, but if I didnt have a drill I wouldn't be able to use the lights feature.<br />Be warned to those who purchase this, be very careful with the battery for screw. they're cheap and turned too tightly.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|It was a lot like old Black Sabbath but it still was not like Paranoid or Master of Reality Black Sabbath. I guess I miss Bill Ward's drumming even though the new drummer is very good but still different style than Bill Ward.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I hardly need to add to the chorus of praise for this game. It is fun and addictive. Highly recommended.
B002C6K7NA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this album and there were some songs that gave me chicken skin. I have always been a Skynyrd fan since the original line up with Ronnie but there is no doubt the new line up is very good and has its own style that I have grown to love as much as the original. I look forward to many more albums in the future.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|this is a fun game but would like more ways to get coins and would like to be able to skip on if needed
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I could try and describe the way this wonderful story unexpectedly lodged itself into my brain. But, I won't. Instead, I'll just tell you to read the book and be prepared for it to stick with you when you finish, whether you want it to or not.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Great item works as describes fast shipping. Hardbshell case protects the kindle and is lightwieght. Good color as well and stays secure on kindle
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a very fun game for people of all ages. I have become addicted to it trying to get all the levels and cars unlocked. Would recommend!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|A very handy tool to have in your Kindle.  I can move files around from folder to folder to keep them better organized.<br /><br />I also use it to move files from my computer's shared drive on my home network.  that's how I found the easiest way to transfer files from Windows XP to my Kindle - super slick.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I think it's a fun and witty game. Can be frustrating when the level restarts over. Overall I enjoy the game
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|MoboPlayer has played every type of video file I've tried.  It even played an .mkv video file from Europe at 25 frames per second.  Not many US products will do that.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Me and my girlfriend lost faith in TV for some time and this show brought it back. Post apocalyptic shows seem to be a fad in recent years and this one is at the top. Some content may be graphic for children but it was an overall excellent show. I went on to watch the second season on Amazon Prime and bought the third season as well.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I wish more of the actors from the first movie were in this one. I loved the Snake Eyes fight scene in the mountains but that is the only thing that stood out for me. I won't buy this one unless I can get it for less than $5
B005LAII44|4.0|It was a fun watch but you are not any smarter at the end. You will stay awake till the end.
B00EDF43MY|4.0|Really enjoy all of Dr. Panda's Apps, this one is no different. Entertaining enough for my 4 year old and simple enough for her to figure our on her own.
B00915G6NK|5.0|I don' watch a lot of TV, but I admit to being hooked on this show.  I love the chemistry between the partners, the action, the humor and the wisdom of Hetty.  And by adding that creep, Granger, to the mix, they gave the show a whole new dimension.  This is really good stuff.
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|This Envelope is a low-volume soft cushion that does not slip out of my hands .I expect to make out ok,  if the thing drops to the floor
B0014JKJHK|2.0|I have bought these shoes before and have loved them... this pair is very slippery on the floors of the kitchen I work in...I have never had this problem before...not sure I will buy them again
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The way this text is supported by references is outstanding.He often deals with Questions that had been left lingering in my head during my religious education as a young Christian and his compassion is admirable.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game wish it had a Clydesdale and a donkey or mini horse to buy. But its a fun game. I am glad I gave this game a try. :-)
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Just when you think LADY GAGA cannot out do her previous music she does just that. As a fan of her music I could not wait to hear from Mother Monster and this song makes up for the Gaga withdrawal. Right from the beginning this song captures your attention because it sounds kind of like the Phantom of the Opera theme but amped up. You get the sense that something amazing is about to happened and when you hear LADY GAGA's breathtaking voice you get transcendent into full Mother Monster world. Of course if after you hear the song you are not sold watch LADY GAGA in full action in her Applause video and you will understand why she is just spectacular.The chorus is pretty much understanding she lives to make us happy hence, we will applaud her.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|one of my favorite lines in the film...not sure why.  great star trek film.  lots of humor and great scenery.  San Francisco and the Pacific Ocean .
B005J0VPNC|3.0|Its cool. Works well with bright pics. I like the different styles that are saved and that you can also make your own.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Well paced and believable drama - independent film . McConahy shines in these types of films. Kid actors are good.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|I love CG flicks, but this is the best movie to come out in a long time that didn't need any of that to be spectacular. Enough has been written by other reviewers about the movie. All I can add is you will never see it coming. Don't close your eyes for a second. Don't look at your phone, tablet or computer. Don't eat like I was doing. This movie needs and keeps your attention. You will be mesmerized by the events. This is one of the greatest  magic shows of all time! DON'T MISS IT!
0545586178|5.0|This was a replacement purchase.  The second of the Hunger Games trilogy and a fantastic story.  The first time I read I couldn't put it down and read until 5 AM.  I gave that book to my granddaughter and had to replace it so I could re-read it.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|1st movie to ever move me enough to write a review. My only bios is that I am a Johnny Depp fan. The movie is a different spin on boy meets girl. It's serious, but classic with a dichotomy between seriously funny and just plain serious. Highly recommend.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This was actually a replacement., I loaned my first dvd to somebody or other and it wasn't returned.  I loved the story, the acting is great, the photography outstanding.  I would highly recommend top anyone who loves adventure, romance, WWII stories and excitement.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Ok...so where do I begin...Let me say that I have listened to NIN and TR since I was a freshman in high school...I remember buying Downward Spiral and The Fragile on the release date and remember sitting back and just letting the music sink in.  As soon as I got home from work last night I ripped open the plastic and put it in and turned it up...I was actually shocked...in a good way.  I was not crazy about Year Zero and even less crazy about the Slip but much to my surprise this CD is a very melodic step forward.  The last three songs (minus the instrumental final track) are my favorites lyrically and musically.  Trent plays a SAX for goodness sake!  I have no idea why so many people on here are giving this record 1 and 2 star reviews.  This is as good as the Fragile and almost as good as Downward Spiral...nothing will ever beat that CD but why expect it to?  Yes he sounds more content and happier on this recording but we all have to cheer up sometime.  No he does not scream his head off but Trent is Trent and that is where he happens to be during this period of his life.  If you are considering this CD you may want to pay the extra few bucks and go for the deluxe edition which has very sturdy and nice packaging not to mention a bonus CD with 3 remixes.
B009WHDE3C|4.0|I had no idea what this picture was about, but it sounded as though it might another take of the Fawlty Towers genre. It wasn't. It was, however, a very good picture with a great, well balanced cast of seasoned British actors.
B007QSNMS6|4.0|While the book might seem very self serving, the authors are merely trying to talk about their own experiences and their own observations. I see nothing wrong with that. What one takes away from the book is completely up to the readers. Give it a try. I like the dialogue/conversation format that they have used.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I read the book in an evening and enjoyed this young adult novel.  Frankly, the price was too high for it's length and content.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed meeting and getting to know all the characters. The storyline was farfetched, but believable, thanks to the skilled writing of the author. She succinctly developed all of the dramas then successfully bound them together with wit and passion. I have always loved Australian (film) drama because of the characters. I want to meet more of them..... I will check out additional Liane Moriarty offering.
B000HZCZZ6|5.0|Any Star Trek is good viewing (with a few exceptions)  in my opinion.  Insurrection revives old familiar characters, kind of like having a family reunion.  The next generation crew was one of my favorite crews.  All good things come to an end however, even movies.  The new trek movies are trying to stir old emotions but in a different way.  Hopefully, some day, a new, refreshing Star Trek series will come back to broadcast TV and old and new fans alike will experience the all new missions of the Starships of the United Federation of Planets.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|David Mack, author of this series \\"Cold Equations\\"  Stand up and take a bow sir! Well done. The book is pieced together and so well written that the reader will have trouble putting it down. Fusing together Dr. Soong's storyline into the narrative ties in remarkably well and I dare say brings the book to an emotional climax at the end. It leaves you wanting to read book II immediately afterwards. I was skeptical after reading the Typhoon Pacts last book if I could continue Star Trek TNG, but this book brought me back. A very fast and interesting read. I highly recommend it. On to book II.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|While I am not a young adult, I enjoyed this book very much. I read it in two sittings because it was so addictive. Interesting topic and great characters.
B00AHDXTIK|4.0|I was looking for a long cable after the cheap knock-off I got from China failed. I decided on this cable because of the price and reviews. First off I'd like to say the cable performed wonderfully expect in one particular case. I was on vacation and brought this cable and the wall charger. It has always charged fine with the wall charger but when I was in the car this cable was not charging consistently (kept connecting and disconnecting from the stereo). I tried my friends apple lightning cable and it worked fine with no disconnects. I gave a 4 star just because of this, although this doesn't really affect how I use the cable under normal circumstances. Also note that the cable is thicker than the Apple cable. It will not bend as easily. This can be a good and bad thing. Good because the cable is protected but bad because the cable doesn't bend or twist much. This causes the cable to give resistance when I use it bend and am moving around. Again, this isn't major and wouldn't stop me from buying it but just want people to be aware. (I've owned 2 of these for 3 months now)
B0081336FO|5.0|If you liked the first season then you'll not be disappointed.  Yes there are times where it is a bit predictable and even cheesy(that was the case in the first season too),  but most of the acting is fabulous and so is the script.  Sometimes the Moriarty character is a bit over the top, that would be my only big criticism.  My favorite Holmes and Watson team that I have seen in any movie or television adaptation.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I really enjoyed it. It gave me a clear prospective of the historic events and mentality of the time. Easy to read and understand.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is well written and thoroughly engages the reader from beginning to end.  Hard to put down even for a moment!  History delivered on an easy to digest platter.
B006MPKDUE|5.0|A well put together script. The storyline keep you guessing as to who the murderer was. right up till the end
B000Z27HLS|3.0|I thought it ended rather abruptly; I would have liked to see one more scene.  It was an okay view.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great series however the very ending was way too dull compared to the rest of the series, felt thrown together as if the author put very little thought into last 2 chapters
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Good character development, story lines and great clothes.  Gives a human face to lawyers...and that is hard.  Love, love Donna and Rachel.
B001J710Y8|5.0|Always perfer the original to the new ones. This one  is better than the second one. I hate remakes of good  British moves made to look like usa movies.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun but it's a whore.  Constantly need to post to Facebook or write this stupid review in order to continue playing.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This CD is my all time favorite. Now my grandson wants to watch this all the time. He almost has learned this cd word for word.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised how much depth the story line had and good humor that the movie provided.  Good action
B0058YPILY|5.0|Love this series with a fiery passion! Excellent condition. Arrived prepackaged and everything. Thank you :) Keep up the good work you wonderful person you :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app at first I bought it and I didn't know anything about it but I was so easy to learn that I figured it out in 2 hours
B00DWZHTOU|4.0|This is a review of the extended version of the film watched with the BluRay copy. It may contain some minor spoilers.<br /><br />At the end I found the film a satisfying heist film and a satisfying magic film. I am quite the lover of magic films of which there have been many lately ever since watching Tony Curtis as Houdini every year on Family Classics (TV).<br /><br />However early on in the film (with a running time of over 2 hours) I found some of it heavy going. I thought that Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both phoned in performances cloned from other movies. I can understand the age needs of the Freeman and Caine characters for plot reasons but I think other character actors would have better value to the parts. The main problem with the characters is that there is no actually likeable or unlikeable but interesting person to identify with. One starts to wish the all the characters will be killed off in nasty ways to get to a satisfying ending. The female escapologist was the most interesting of the \\"four horsemen\\" but did not seem to get much screen time. Indeed none of the \\"four horsemen\\" characters was given any real background or development excepting for a hackneyed plot point of a former relationship between two of them. It would have been better if they had been brother and sister, fraternal twins even, who previously had worked together and now loath each other. The other female character, the Interpol agent, would have been interesting if given more development. Instead she was a useful red herring and an attachment point for a possible romance which was unbelievable and more sexual harassment than anything else. The many chase scenes, seemingly mostly in the dark, were typical film chases: everyone can run full out for long periods, no one gets hurt when they fall, no clothes are ripped, no collateral damage to civilians during car chases. There are also certain plot points whose improbably even impossibility needs to be ignored especially when itcomes to the computer and phone hacking elements.<br /><br />At the end I did enjoy the film because the puzzle of the plot when fully uncovered gave that flush feeling one gets at the end of films like \\"The Sting\\". And, of course, it is a film about stage magic which was done to a high level. It even looked \\"practical\\" in most respects and not a result of editing or CGI.
1452000247|4.0|All in all, this really was a fun fairy tale to read. I enjoyed it, and I know that many others would to. Peter learns many things, and grows up a lot through the course of the book. This fairy tale fits right in with all the others, and is a great read.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|We both loved the book - the work is very informative and inspiring.  Saw Jesus in a whole new light.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I live in the deep southand knowing about the weather is crucial. It allows me to make safe decisions for family.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love the combination of tones/sounds, etc you can have. I didn't think it would really help but it has alot.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Stellar performances by McConaughey, Witherspoon, and Sam Shepard.  The two boys were solid!  Fantastic script with some very moving family conflict and good suspense.
B004FOA84A|2.0|you need a magnify glass to see the stuff, and if you get stuck, your stuck! no point in trying, at least give me a hint.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|This is super for the price.  It's especially helpful in busy/active Wi-Fi environments because there's more detail than the Kindle shows in its network applet.
B00973902K|5.0|Nice catchy tune!  Don't know what else to say, either you like it or you don't. I did, the kids got me hooked.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is one of the better weather applications I've tried, even with the ads included with the free version.  Forcasts and radar images are great.
B00B9366VO|4.0|While I'm not really a big fan of the music of the artists that are featured in the doc, the story itself is great. It's got stuff for casual music fans, stuff for music gear nerds, stuff for rock history buffs, it's well shot and directed and written. It even almost got me inspired enough to dust off the old guitar...almost. I'm not a super huge fan of Grohl's post Nirvana music although I can't help but have total respect for the man as a musician and artist, and his movie debut is well worth a watching if you're a rock history fan.
B00005JPGO|5.0|I really like this movie. I've seen it three times already and will probably watch it again. Great performances by Leonardo di Caprio (who did a great job with the Dutch accent by the way!) and Djimon Hounsou (who is so handsome).
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I had no problem with this app. My daughter and I cannot get enough of the game on my kindle. I recommend this app to anyone. It's a great past time.
B00CTT9646|1.0|I really wanted this, but have cancelled the order in protest at the horrible exploitative release strategy by Paramount - NO SPECIAL FEATURES!!  NO COMMENTARY!!!  Just a few basic EPK shorts.  ALL OF THE FEATURES HAVE BEEN PUT ON OTHER DISKS AS 'RETAILER EXCLUSIVES\\" - Thanks for trying to screw your consumers Paramount, but no thanks.  You can keep this over priced PHaser replica!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this bible app. The only problem I have is that I would like to use this offline and an easier way to access the books of the bible.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|The latest offering from Quentin lives up to his previous endeavors and may just be his best.  We all loved watching this one in my movie theater
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|My daughter plays this game and she likes it a lot. I guess it's okay for a kid. Downloaded with no problems.
B005B0QYMM|1.0|Like watching paint dry.  We all agreed ages 15-60.  I am going to regift this item to a former friend
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Of course the books are always better than the movie's. I enjoyed this trilogy very much. I recommend this book
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I tried to read this novel because it came so highly recommended. But the theme and cadence was a little too cumbersome for me to finish. There may be something satisfying towards the end but I could not be drawn in quick enough to appreciate what is probably a fine classic novel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well scripted and well acted. Nice plot twists. I really enjoying watching shows that portray times in history accurately, particularly the caste system here.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|This is a very funny movie, maybe a little bit unknow but for me one of the best. The comedy is very klever and make you sit and laugh a lot.<br /><br />Full recommended
B008ROZAQU|5.0|have saw  this movie many times still great to watch , they would would never make one like it in these times
B000P6PVLC|5.0|One of the best, cannot believe this got 3 stars and other trash here gets 4. An excellent movie worth watching.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great pick for summer reading.  My son enjoyed the book and scored a 100 on his presentation.<br />Great story!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It is exactly what it say it is. Wakes me up with an alarm and shows the time. Easy to see with our my glasses at night.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This story will capture attention from the very start. One can relate to this happening in real life. You won't want it to finish.<br />I couldn't put this book down, just had to keep reading until I finished.
B005VPRETE|5.0|We bought the first tree house lego set for our 5 year old granddaughter.  It was just slightly above her head and the pieces are really tiny.  But, a neighbor who was 7 came over and whipped through the instructions and created great pieces.  We now purchased our second one for our 7 yr old granddaughter who really wanted it.  I think you should get this for 7 years old and up.  Again, the pieces are REALLY tiny.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Efficient and easy to control for a non-techie.  My husband showed me this app and I use it  to arise on time.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|After reading both of Hosseini's previous books, which were wonderfully written but emotionally draining, I approached this one with caution.  After reading the first couple of chapters, I was hooked.  The lives of the characters in this book are not easy by any means, but there is something wonderfully uplifting and redemptive about their journeys.  The book is more like a series of short stories, but all the characters are linked in some way, through blood, marriage or maybe just because they were neighbors at some point, and in the background is this house in Kabul that intersects with all their lives.  Hosseini's writing is really compelling and I could not put this down once I started.  For those who love rich, complex characters, this is a great read, and even though not everything turns out as we would expect or wish, it is strangely satisfying.  More than anything I appreciate the fact that Hosseini is never formulaic in his stories.
B005LAII44|3.0|This segment was okay, but somewhat disjointed as to story line.  Editing was disjointed.  The Bruce Willis segments were fun.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Inline with the other MI movies. Kept you interested. I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, but the MI movies seem to put that dislike aside.
B007Y1JGOY|5.0|If you're a Gothic/Symphonical Metal fan. You must get this album. The more you listen to it the more you love it.
B005F9TQBU|5.0|This was played for us at a friend's house, and we immediately ordered it for our collection. I consider it Santana's &#34;mellow jazz&#34;. Very easy to listen to. If you think Santana only played Rock, you are in for a treat!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I picked this up as a free app of the day. It wouldn't be any good on my original kindle fire, but lots of fun on my phone. It applies filters to your photos in real time, so you can choose a subject, play with the filter choices, then take your shot. Nice.
0345803485|1.0|A friend gave me this book to listen to while my boyfriend and I were commuting back and forth between our residences, little did she know that in that single act of \\"generosity\\" she would rob me of my faith in humanity. I had heard all the hype, and was particularly intrigued by the lusty review handed down from my friend's normally frigid wife. To stir the loins of that musty old claptrap, this must be a wanton sex romp where anything goes right? Wrong. Never have I been more wrong.<br /><br />Less than one disc in I was possessed with the compelling urge to beat the author within an inch of her life with a thesaurus. Limited vocabulary aside, the book is written like a drunk 13-year-old dictated the whole thing to a chimpanzee with a traumatic brain injury. I was overwhelmed by the mere thought that this book was read and then VOLUNTARILY published. I began to have vivid nightmares of post-apocalyptic societies finding this drivel buried under a Justin Beiber album and immediately banning literature and music forever. Not that I would blame them.<br /><br />However, the promise of smut was too great to resist. \\"Maybe,\\" I thought to myself, \\"this woman's talents lie in divulging the sordid details of carnal pleasures. If I just wait through this, it will transform itself into a sideshow of desire.\\" I liken it to the first stage of grief: Denial.<br /><br />I slogged on, and with each 'Oh my' and 'Inner Goddess' I felt myself swelling with incalculable rage.<br /><br />\\"Stop listening to it if you hate it that much.\\" my boyfriend pleaded.<br /><br />\\"It has to get better.\\" I snarled \\"This is supposed to be the great smut book of our generation.\\" He stopped questioning me when I went on a five minute long rant about the author's inability to grasp the concept of a 'subconcious'. To quote the Princess Bride: \\"That word does not mean what you think it means.\\" Thus, I passed through the second stage of grief: Anger.<br /><br />As I toiled through disc after disc with these shallow characters, I begged the publishing gods for some sort of turning point to justify the cultural embrace of this steaming pile of literary excrement. I prayed for some sort of validation, but it never came. Ana was still an idiot, Christian was still a suave version of Michael Scott, and the other characters...I don't know...existed? The third stage of grief: Bargaining, came and went with nary a whisper.<br /><br />I closed in on the end of the book, my soul weighed down with the incredible crassness of an adult virgin coming into sexual awakening with a 20 something gazillionaire (I'm aware that word is ridiculous, but I'm sure E.L. James doesn't, and would have used it if she had been able to extend her brain beyond the constant loop of 'crap' variations). It wasn't even hot. Heck, it wasn't even kinky. This is like June and Ward Cleaver playing Sex Adventure Time. Badly. I've been more turned on by CSPAN. I felt the fourth stage of grief in every fiber of my being. My depression consumed me. This was the end of days, and a British fan fiction writer was the antichrist.<br /><br />Finally, mercifully, I finished. I have made it to the final stage of grief: Acceptance. I have accepted that this is very likely the worst book ever written, definitely the worst book ever published. We can not come back from this. We are forever unclean. Culture has tumbled over a precipice where it cannot return. We may die, but this unfathomable example of the decline of English language and intellectual fortitude will live on. May (insert diety here) have mercy on our souls.
B005MHI0QM|3.0|Fascinating. More about a girl coming of age than about the war. The war intrudes into the narrative only secondarily. Of course, it sets the entire stage as it forced them into hiding. It really brings out the humanity that was destroyed by the Nazis.<br />Tragic loss of a very talented young writer.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Amazing. though I prefer the phantom of the opera. This was beautiful. the words. the music. very haunting but in a intoxicating way. love it.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I am not pleased with this purchase.  Every time I go to this app, it keeps saying I must have an internet connection the 1st time I open the app.  I have opened it 7 times & still get this message??????  Looking for another Holy Bible King James Version app.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As a Lutheran Pastor, I've read a number of &#34;historical Jesus&#34; books.  This one is not only unique, it's a real page-turner.  While I don't necessarily subscribe to all Mr. Aslan's premises, I found the historical references to be extremely helpful.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Easy, fast, good read for those who like fantasy from a child's perspective, with some adult messages.  Nice break from bleaker stories.
B000002OX7|5.0|My favorite who disc.  Not a bad track on it... do yourself a favorite and get tis on a hard copy before everything is download
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Watched it on my computer. The watching was quick to load and easy to pause when wanted or needed to do more studying instead of playing...lol.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I got this last night and couldn't stop reading it until I was DONE! Such an amazing book! I would recommend this book to ANYONE. It's not just a Young Adult book, it's for everyone. John Green is amazing and I can't wait to download ALL of his books!
0756405890|2.0|Kvothe is too arrogant and has ZERO humility. It made it so hard to like him when he's a pompous, pretentious know-it-all little brat. If I had to hear (listened with audible which only seemed to exacerbate his arrogance), \\"If you have never experienced blah-blah-blah, then I cannot expect you to know blah-blah-blah...\\"  I have never wanted to reach out and punch a protagonist so much as Kvothe!<br /><br />As K. Sullivan has already mentioned, no other characters had any real development (especially his supposed two best friends). The way he talks about Denna is ridiculous (she cannot be chased, or wooed or whatever. I'll just sit by and wait for her to come to me). He got friend-zoned, pure and simple but he's too up his own arse to realize it!<br /><br />The story was pretty decent and whenever Kvothe wasn't bragging about his intelligence or just talking about himself period, it was a pleasure. Problem is, Kvothe not talking about himself are scenes that are very few and very far between...<br /><br />Definitely not picking up the next book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Not your typical boring movie tie in game.  Very addictive and super fun, even if you just poke your minion on the menu screen.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Hooked after watching the first episode! Keeps you wanting more and more and more. love it! Can't wait for season 2.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. I laughed, I cried, I was angry to know of such treatment on innocent children, but most of all....I loved this book.  Well written story.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much. It was recommended by a friend and her description of it sounded depressing but I ordered it anyway. I am so glad that I did. The story was so good that I could not put it down. The characters were beautifully written. One feels they are people you know and care about. I gave this book five stars and will read more of this author.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I liked how Flynn gets the mood and feelings of each moment well developed.  I will read more by this author.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Can't get enough! Great Show! No other show like it. I want a dragon! nuff said! Can't wait for season 3
B002P79KAC|5.0|Best sitcom on TV nothing beats it and it really just has you laughing throughout each episode. It is truly well crafted the acting is all phenomenal and the writing is the best part they really made a good show when it comes to The Big Bang Theory.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|What can you say about Bruce but nothing but brilliant! Got the DVD so i can hear him sing London Calling.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|Great book w/ sort of a funky cool twist.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll pick up the rest of the books in the series. If they are even half as good as the first then it'll be worth the read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is an awesome read. I couldn't put it down. I like that Gideon is so attentive to Eva's needs and wants. Every woman needs a man like that. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was a great book, recommended to be by an older uncle of mine. I can't wait to pick up the next in the series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is no simple object search or brain teaser. Beautiful graphics that look and sound realistic make this so much more than any other games I have played! I can't wait for more, more, more!
B008JFURII|5.0|Have not seen this movie as of yet.I was going through picking out some movies to buy when i notice this one was not released as of yet ,I had put it in the wrong cart so I deleted it and put it under pre-order where it needed to be. thank you
B0098G7AWS|5.0|Its not a romance, its not a documentary, neither is a horror, yet James Cameron weaves all of these elements into his harrowing, haunting tale.  The historical facts are all in line, the romance is a pleasant touch, and there is just enough suspense to keep you captivated but not repelled.  The video quality was great, and i could move back and forth without stalling.  Thank you, James Cameron and Amazon:)
B000HIVQK8|5.0|I think this record is on the same level as &#34;All Things Must Pass&#34;, only missing the big production, but for me it's an improvement.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Let me preface this by saying I've read the book a long time ago. That being said the movie reminded me of all the good parts and the soundtrack was phenomenal. Would definitely recommend it to everyone!
B00459EZLW|5.0|I love this show and hate that it ended after only 2 seasons..  I want more!!!!  I think they should make a movie.
B00CA4S27W|4.0|Great musicianship and composition. Candice has a beautiful singing voice! I would recommend this to any Ritchie Blackmore fans.<br />Bravo!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I love Kindle editons of anything. Go green! This triligy is one I can read over and over. Thanks, Amazon!
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Final episode was really well done. It was emotional. Sex, Violence, Politics. All there. Highly recommended. Each character has unique and strong characteristics. Highly recommended.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|Love the punky kind of 80s style of this doll. She is very pretty and like Twyla and Howleen from the sister pack, she is a smaller doll, she has tiny little clawed hands which is cute. The pink hair looks really good but I prefer the curly orange (just a preference) but it's nice and soft, looks good long, the beanie with her ears poking out is very sweet. The only downside is that Howleen and Twyla come with the usual size stands, so you either have a hovering doll or the stand poking up into their hair... It would be easy to cut down though. Love this wee ghoul!
0765357151|1.0|Not a full novel..First 1/3 book about a guy who is the only one left in the world who is not a vampire and written words on his mental process as he deals with it.  BORING!!!!!!!!  Didn't bother reading the rest of the stories.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|She is such a cute doll and I love her little pet Dust bunny! Her hair is the only thing I don't really like, it's kind of fuzzy and sticky, I guess you could wash it. The hair colour itself is very pretty and has the base pale aqua, purple and what you can't tell from the photos - bright blue steaks. Her theme is very cool, with the door handle earrings and dream catcher/spiders decorating her, the make up is very sweet. I didn't know how little she was, but she looks adorable compared to the 'older Monster High students'. Love her!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Very good. The characters are very complex and the plot lines are engaging, if a little on the dramatic side.
B0014DW3OS|3.0|Rented this movie to watch with friends. Only one in the group who hasn't seen it. It was on tv and we caught it too late for me to understand the plot. Able to rent it on Amazon easily. Great quality and price for a quick rental.
1439153663|5.0|Love this book. The author does an amazing job of making you feel like you are right there when all this was happening. Characters were beautifully described.
B0089LOG02|5.0|200,000 children. One Story. Since I was born and raised in New England I feel that this story is only the beginning of enlightenment to a part of history I never knew about. I've more reading to do.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Easy to play with enough challenge to keep it from being boring.  Just wish they had more levels to play. Recommended for anyone looking to kill time.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|If you're a fan of Downtown Abbey, you'll be a fan of Lark Rise to Candleford!  It's a great story.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Not many books deserve 5 stars... This one is so well written that it really got my attention. The story deals with a murder, so it is not a light or joyous book necessarily, but it is very well written. It's rare to see lines in novels highlighted by so many readers and this novel had a handful. The dialogue is compelling and realistic. Only in a few spots did it seem overworked. I liked it. I'll recommend it to my friends who like crime stories.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Loved the series and great video Quality.. Prime instant video is wonderful!  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes a action!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I missed \\"Dredd\\" in the theater, but caught it via Amazon Prime's streaming feature. I was so thoroughly entertained that I immediately purchased the Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Unlike Sylvester Stallone's terrible \\"Judge Dredd\\", Karl Urban's \\"Dredd\\" is true to the character and spirit of the source comic. I recommend this movie to comic fans and action movie enthusiasts alike.
B000FBJHT4|2.0|I only was able to get about a third of the way through this.Totally boring and did not satisfy much of anything.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am very active with outdoor sports and activities. I find the weather reports very useful and spot on for planing daily and weekly  activities, especially boating and fishing here on the Columbia river and Puget Sound areas in the state of Washington.
B00EQUP3Q6|3.0|Hesitation Marks is the kind of album you wouldn't think this guy could make at this point. After Ghosts and Year Zero, and then onto The Slip, it seemed kind of like things might be over for the pop/industrial stylist. But this is something I find as fun to listen as the better parts of With Teeth and Year Zero. A couple of those had some painfully obvious lyrics and then a good 3/4 of the two albums were actually quite excellent.<br /><br />The same can be said here. &#34;Everything&#34; is going to put some NIN fans in strict denial but in actuality it isn't that bad. I honestly think the song fits though it sounds too pushed in the dynamic range on this non-audiophile version. A lot of the songs seem to fit here and that is definitely a good thing. Cohesion works well to dispel inherent flaws.<br /><br />Satellite is purely excellent, the best song besides the openers, and though it sounds like Year Zero, it could be easily one of the best tracks on Year Zero. It's hard to say how you compare this album to his whole repertoire. This isn't The Fragile or TDS. Nothing can be at this point. Fans wanting that loathing, gritty, and industrial sound should listen to Ghosts or TDS or whatever. I listen anything from King Crimson to Nick Drake to Meshuggah to any number of classical and pop artists. As long as the music is tasteful I have no problem with it.<br /><br />I don't come into reviews with preconceived notions and neither do I expect artists to cater to me. I do expect artists to not give me abominable trash though. TDS and The Fragile will remain my favorite NIN albums, along with Still, Ghosts, and Broken, for the extent of Reznor's career more than likely. This one does have interesting beats that recall the resurgence of the 80s and early 90s at times with a lot of newfound flourishes and creative samples.<br /><br />But what this album belongs to is the new direction NIN is taking for better or worse. A new look at what they can and cannot do properly. On the whole a 7.5 or 8 is a perfect rating for this album. It's solid and a little weird. Eater of Dreams into Copy of A is a pretty damn fine opener and the beats keep coming, the extraneous noises keep sounding creative, and most of the lyrical stuff is at least toned if not hugely poetical at times. There were certain songs on With Teeth and Year Zero that were a little bit fishy in the lyrics, forced to the point of breaking, and though that can still happen, it doesn't happen as much anymore, or in the least it is covered up by sound or crafted to be more poppy where the lyrics fit.<br /><br />People can like and leave what they want imo. What does this man have left to prove may I ask? Making albums like TDS simply isn't possible in his current mindset. Those albums are once in a decade albums. For what it is here I feel comfortable with if not infatuated with on the whole. NIN has become a great all around band. They should keep recording so we get more of this sort of sound. I wouldn't mind detours like Ghosts either with limited lyrics or something of that nature.<br /><br />If I had to compare new releases from old geniuses this is better than Corgan's Oceania by a decent margin. Corgan has no equal, really, in the lyrical department from Siamese Dream to Adore. His stuff these days is somewhat painful at times. This never seems to harass my ears like Oceania does regularly.<br /><br />The artwork is amazing on all releases. The best they have had since The Fragile era. Of course the TDS artist had a lot to do with that and he should be credited. Russell Mills does amazing stuff PERIOD.<br /><br />One more note is the severe crushing on this album. It is DR5. For a DR5 album it actually doesn't sound too bad because of the nature of the minimalist style and beats. When it gets full of sound though it can grate on the ears.<br /><br />For some totally ****ed up reason the so called &#34;audiophile&#34; version of this album basically bumps the dynamic rangeto DR6. I mean, WTF is the collective sigh that audiophiles around the world gave out. Why and the hell would you make such a big deal about a boost of such tiny importance. I was expecting DR9 across the board and that isn't what some consider audiophile though it is fine for this type of music.<br /><br />Anyway, try it out if you are unsure, on a site where you can hear some of the material. In the age of free music I don't really see why people have to complain so much.to DR6. I mean, WTF is the collective sigh that audiophiles around the world gave out.

B001974DG0|5.0|I am not usually a  mystery book person, but this was by far one of the best reads ever! I have read it 2x and gave it to both my sons and friends to read. They all loved it as well.<br />Led me to read some of Koontz's other works too.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it does everything I want in in alarm clock and does it easily.  wakes you to a gentle alarm that gets louder over time so it doesn't startle you out of bed.  you can set multiple alarms and for different days of the week.  brest app.
B002DEI4NG|4.0|Fast delivery and 2 excellent products for the price of one. I grew up on this show so I have enjoyed the stroll down memory lane by getting to rewatch the episodes.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good action adventure movie.  Plot could have been a little stronger but it was very exciting.  Tom is always a good actor
1401235425|3.0|I've bought Batman comics for 13 years.I can honestly say that out of everything to come out of the New 52, this is the best that there is. I am only giving it 3 stars because, while it is a good story, it doesn't quite feel like Batman.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and we watched the whole thing in about 3 days time.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|It works great and is a big help when searching for WIFI access points or for plotting out your own house.

B008200LHW|5.0|I bought this to replace the defunct Parrot dongle that came with my Parrot Asteroid Smart and I could not be happier.  It obtains a fix even before I've left my garage.
B00280LYHS|5.0|So, I found the first book on Amazon and fell in love with it. I read all 5 books in 10 days; I loved them so much. I literally finished this book in one day. All though I have already read the whole series of, &#34;Lost Hero,&#34; I think I'm gonna read them again. Rick Riordan is an amazing author. He writes for children and adults. This book is great for anyone from ages 8 to 80. I rate this 6 out of 5, and really hope Percy Jackson stays well known.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I read this book because I saw a movie trailer for it. thinking that it looked awesome. Adter reading it the whole thing is just very anti-climatic.
B000031EGV|4.0|My grandson loves this movie, we had recorded on the dvr and he watched it constantly was so glad I found it on Amazon!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love this show...it always hold my attention and keeps me guessing.  The guys are handsome and the women smart and sassy.  Both can hold their own in court and out.  The chemistry and tension between them is just enough to keep me interested and wanting more.  Hope this airs for a long time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so good I want to play it all day this is the best best best best best best game ever

B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this game, very addicting and great for passing the time, great animations and has lots to do, fires, medical emergencies, all
1594746036|4.0|It is obvious that the author wrote the book around the collection of old photographs.I'm  not sure  I like the characters enough to follow them. It is an interesting concept,though.

I do not know if this is a bug.<br />Total Stars = 3
B005ORVN1Y|2.0|Signals standard cd remaster had improved clarity and detal compared to the orginal. Although I wish they could remix Neil's drums louder with more dynamics. The rest was a waste of time. The orginal power windows, vinyl of course, is the best version, and represents one of Rush's best sounding studio works. Not there best record mind you, but there best production sound mix ect. Why they didn't do this for grace or continue with this quality production in HYF and thereafter I can't figure out. Proving the the quality of the orginal production can't really be saved or transformed into a great sounding record no matter how many time you remaster it.<br /><br />Grace still sounds flat and distant with poor dynamics and detail . HYF still has Neil's drums in the background with limited dynamics and air. Why one would mix Neil's drums as background stage ill never know. The show of hands has some improvement but your better off with snakes and arrows live blu ray DVD , the best sounding live record form rush. The time machine DVD was poorly mixed, again de emphasizing Neil's drums , placing them back in the mix, limiting the air and dynamics of his playing.<br /><br />Rush has been plaqued by horrid sound production, even more so since 2000 with the worst sounding studio record of all time, vapor trails, a utter sonic mess of blaring loudness. The 80s is a mixed bag of production quality , and all the remastering can't fix some of those inherent issues.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Positive = Evernote is the best digital organizer I have found! It can record your voice, import files and even save an event!; 4 stars<br />The best digital organizer; 1 star<br />No Negatives!
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|There was plenty of action.  One big disappointment was the star never showed his face once.  If I were he, I would not have taken the role.  The story line was not epic; it was an ordinary cops-caught-in-the-middle dirty cop vs. good cop deal.  I thought the original Judge Dredd was much more expansive.  This was more a poor boy's version of Escape from New York.  Fun, but not memorable.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This author is new to me, and usually I don't go for the women's lit format, but glad I took a chance on this.<br /> It is well written and has great characterizations, and the story premise will have you turning the page to find out what is next.  I have since read two other books by this writer and thoroughly enjoyed them.
B000ICZD4I|2.0|Cannot hear well enough.  Watched Abducted a few nights ago and it had closed captioning and we were so happy.  Cannot watch movies without closed captioning.
B008JFUO36|5.0|I like Tom Cruise as an actor. I found this film delightful. VERY good writing,acting, plotting and directing. Awesome visuals. Especially delighted with Olga Kurylenko. Amazing what she has gone through in life from poverty in the Ukraine to a modeling career and now a very good actress. I have seen the film 2 times so far. Will wait to watch it again some time. With so much moronic crap out there, good to see a film so good in so many ways and so many actors.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|The acting and character development is outstanding.  Just when you think you know what will happen, something completely different occurs.  Very suspenseful.  I love the whole series.
B008LV8TSU|3.0|A fun book but not an inspiring one.<br /><br />This book uses the classical tropes of fairy tale story telling and the author does pull off a fun entertaining story. Having the characters semi-self aware of these traditions at the start of the book gives it a fun feel but then the author drops that without letting it continue through the book.<br /><br />(There was a series many years ago that carried this through very well in a bad pulp fantasy way... every trilogy has to have four books)<br /><br />Howl's Castle was a very pleasant read and the lighthearted tone, even through the tribulations part, helps keep things moving along through to the end.
B003274QH6|5.0|I was hooked in the first 15 minutes.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I have to say, I have never seen a series quite like this one.
B002ZM74Y6|3.0|It may have been a great movie when it was released but after having watched classics like Godfather, this one doesn't appeal much.<br />Nevertheless, great performances by De Nero, Liotta, Pesci et al.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|While there a lot of positive reviews for this book, I just couldn't get through it (I made it 18% of the way according to my Kindle). The pacing was slow, and I never developed a liking for any of the characters. I'm sure there was a mystery that was to be slowly revealed, but I lost interest getting through. There were long descriptions of heading down the silo ... and I felt far too much like I was there, plodding along. I like reading sci-fi and read all sorts, but this just wasn't enjoyable. Unfortunately, I can't say why in particular, but if you're a fan of big story lines with sweeping adventures, this isn't it.
B009PLTF3I|5.0|I never owned an early pressing of this classic record to compare with but have owned a Capitol re-issue.  This release is far superior to that one.  I can detect the interplay between the musicians far more on this copy than the other, particularly Cipollina and Duncan.  Album has far more presence than the Capitol re-issue, I wonder how Capitol could release such an inferior version of an artist from their own label.  This vinyl is beautiful 180 grain and is perfectly flat, no horizontal movement of the stylus. The album jacket is a gatefold with the interior having an alternative blue sky version of the cover and a copy of the 45rpm sleeve of \\"Who Do You Love.\\"  The sleeve is plastic lined.  I've read negative comments made by some of Relayer/Friday Music's vinyl re-issues but I doubt that they were referring to this release.<br /><br />I listened to this LP using a Bang & Olufsen Beogram 4004(MM20CL)turntable/Marantz 2270 receiver/JBL L100 speakers.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a great story line based on an aristocratic English family and their staff.  This takes place from the time of the Titanic through World War 1 and beyond.  Can't wait for the next season.
B007FLHW3K|4.0|A great product for Burning Man etc...<br />UPDATE: I have used one of these [M210] for two successive years at BM...for a few hours each time - but then it stopped working and I couldn't find out why [despite several battery changes and fiddling with the connections].<br /> I emailed Monkeylectric.... and after some back and forth it was established that the metal connector outside the battery pack had become detached.<br />Monkeylectric replaced the part and everything now is playa-perfect!<br />Also I find that the programming instructions leave something to be desired!
1574214276|5.0|I took this book on the plane knowing that I needed to be entertained for at least 7 hours on our journey.  With my pen and sketchbook I was easily distracted from the long flight and amazed at the results as the ideas began to develop.  What fun.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The movie all around was an excellent action packed movie for the whole family giving some background on the wizard &#34;behind the curtain&#34;. It did skim on the witches and did not tell much about who they were or how they became the way they were. Not much background on Oz itself or its occupants and the end was a bit of a confuzzle.. what happened to the wizard??
4770030088|1.0|Japanese for busy people romaji edition is ok if you want to learn Japanese, but not enough to read it anywhere, travel to Japan, or keep conversations going with a Japanese person. First of all, you don't want this romaji edition because people outside of school besides otakus dont use romaji. Romaji is like a crutch, you can read Japanese alphabets but its dumbed down to romanization so you can read it because you're familiar with the alphabet. You won't get any practice reading hiragana, katakana, or kanji.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I'm not really a bingo player, but this game can be addicting if you're not careful.  I like the free daily tournament and daily credits that allow you to play several games each day for free.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I think the arguments laid out in this book against wheat are amply supported. The reading gets a little technical and thick, but that is where his best arguments are made. I would have like to see a plan laid out of how to delete the wheat from your diet. (cold turkey? Tougher than you think!) and pictures or testimonials from dieters would also have been nice. Overall, a good book from which I learned a lot.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Not only was it interesting and new material for me, but it was easy to follow.  Mr. Aslan's arguments were laid out well and comprehensible for the average reader.  He provided enough background without going on tangents and losing the reader which is a difficult thing to do while still providing sufficient historical and geographical context. The footnotes and explanations are meaty and provide the reader with ample more information to explore his arguments and material further.<br /><br />The one thing that I enjoyed very much was his description of the early church and the conflict between James, the brother of Jesus, and Paul the apostle. It becomes a nice synthesis of the original Jewish-focused message of Jesus' ministry and how it was transformed by the Greeks and Romans into a more universal message for all.<br /><br />I used the Kindle version and the Audible.  Mr. Aslan narrates his own book and he does a nice job of it.
074322454X|5.0|I loved the series and wanted more so I got the book. Fell in love with the book. I highly recommend the book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app on my phone.  It is convenient, always at my fingertips; and accurate.  Best of all---it's free!  Thanks!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a lot of fun. It is not  very  challenging but some are a little  bit hard . I suggest you try it out
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|FFDP does not disappoint.  Great guitar and drums.  Ivan's voice is better than ever.  Love all the guest appearances, certainly Rob Halford singing &#34;Lift Me Up&#34; is at the the top of the heap.  Modern metal at it's finest.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an addictive and wonderful series.  Each episode is beautifully acted and beautifully filmed.  Maggie Smith is a true British national treasure.  Her timing is impeccable and her expressions are priceless.  Don't miss one episode!
B004IK8PLE|4.0|A very interesting book. No prior knowledge of math or encryption needed.<br />Gives an excellent review of the history of codes and ciphers.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you've enjoyed past Angry Birds games, this won't disappoint!  You do have to pay a small supplement to get access to gathering the feathers, but this is great fun even without that.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the intertwining stories and how they all came together.  Very well written, I really like this author.  His books are always good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What's not to love about Downton Abbey?  Intelligent. Witty. Spectacular. Engaging. And more and more superlatives!  This series, from start to the end of season 3, has been an emotional roller-coaster ride with no foul language, excessive sex or violence.  The interplay of the characters is realistic historically while easily addressing modern family and culture-clash issues. It's a soap, all right.  It's just really, really smart soap.  The dialogue is always interesting, well written and never sappy.  The issues the characters face are issues we face today.  The juxtaposition of modern issues played out in an historical background make the show so interesting, engaging and addicting!  My advice: Do not start watching this series if you don't have a lot of time for television!  Once you start, you will not want to quit until you've seen every episode. Twice! The costumes, landscape, art and every other aspect of the production are to the highest standards.  Beautiful to watch. Elegant to hear. Irresistibly entertaining.  What's not to love?
1863514260|5.0|This book shows you how to blend colors together and also shows you what colors compliment other colors. The projects in the book are beautiful, like looking at a gorgeous painting! What I love most about this book besides the beautiful cover, the soft pages and the resourceful information, is that this book can help me in so many areas. I'm a knitter, makeup artist and I crochet. And this book can help me with all of those crafts when it comes to selecting colors for fair isle or blending eyeshadow combo colors. Love this book!
B00005OCMR|5.0|Seriously, go watch it. Now. No excuses. If you even bothered to glance in Tron: Legacy's direction, WATCH THIS MOVIE. It's a classic, it's beautiful, and it's even better with knowledge of computer science. CS majors, this movie is required to get your degree. Most colleges won't put it on their fancy little list of requirements, but this is required.
B00DUL3VFM|5.0|This was an awesome movie.  Very suspensfull and great for family movie night!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Great for scify and fantasy lovers and all ages
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great app<br />Very easy to use and fun to play very great app great job creating recommend highly yahoo great app good good excellent<br /><br />O
0452289963|5.0|This is one of my favorite all-time books - it's so fresh and original, and so right on.  After reading Eckhardt's eloquent description of the ego, I saw it in myself in action, naturally gained some distance from it and over time it's hold has greatly f loosened.  The concept of the pain body is pretty mind blowing, but It too resonates with notes of truth.  I wanted to write a review today, because I noticed to my surprise that some people had not given this book a 5 star rating.  I just can't understand that - this is an awesome book - so I wanted to add my rating to the rest
B0091QSNEE|5.0|We purchased Dr. Pandas apps and the grandkids ages 4-6 spend hours playing them. Thanks you Dr. Panda for teaching them while having fun.
B008133MDK|5.0|I enjoy the show. The show is done so wonderfully. The writing and acting is great. I wish series three would air sooner in the u.s.a.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|We purchased Dr. Pandas apps and the grandkids ages 4-6 spend hours playing them. Thanks you Dr. Panda for teaching them while having fun.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I can't wait to watch more.  Charming characters, mind-boggling, humorous.  So thankful to my friend for recommending it and even more pleased that I gave it a chance.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|We purchased Dr. Pandas apps and the grandkids ages 4-6 spend hours playing them. Thanks you Dr. Panda for teaching them while having fun.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The Marware covers provides flexibility, sturdiness and beauty.  Good value for the money. Would highly recommend for your Kindle. Thanks.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|We purchased Dr. Pandas apps and the grandkids ages 4-6 spend hours playing them. Thanks you Dr. Panda for teaching them while having fun.
B006S01GH2|4.0|Cute and inspiring movie about breaking outside your boundaries to find something absolutely worthwhile. one two three four five six.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|We purchased Dr. Pandas apps and the grandkids ages 4-6 spend hours playing them. Thanks you Dr. Panda for teaching them while having fun.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Nice game to play to pass the time. Finally figured out how to spot Scrat when he runs across the screen.  Really like playing the bonus game.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|pig's. hd. is cool because. you billed.  cars. for the pig's. and. get. specle boxes. angry.  birds. friends is cool.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Would like to have had more to it at the end of the book, or at least a sequel to carry it through.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows on television. Recommend to anyone who wants to be entertained. Keeps you on the edge of your seat
0307346617|5.0|The book is set up as a series of survivor anecdotes. It doesn't just give you the basic stories you're used to from a zombie book but it really goes above an beyond to touch upon so many new areas. Max Brooks doesn't dumb down the consequences of one countries actions and another. A lot of the stories take you through one series of events that led to the story of another survivor. The part about the K9 units and their trainers really tugged at my heart. You forget that this hasn't happened (yet) but it will keep these things at the forefront of your mind. Once you start reading you can't wait to finish. It kept my attention and even got me in trouble at work a couple times. This was fine because now my boss loves it too.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The show grabs you on a visceral level. It's perfectly cast. I only wish I could catch up on all the episodes I missed without paying per episode.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Roller coaster action movie.  Action doesn't quit coming like most die hard movies.  But got to say tired of it.  Ok to watch but if you watched other Die Hard movies get ready of more of the same.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|They are among my top 2-3 favorite groups!  All their songs are hits to me!  I look forward to their next album!  I have seen them in concert and they're fantastic!
B00DHRLK84|4.0|Not a action packed action flick.  It actually has a story and character development.  It is a zombie movie so you have a lot of the same story lines like you would expect in a zombie film.  But it does have its own twist on the story.  And Brad pitt as always great job acting in this movie.  Worth a watch.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|He just keeps getting better with age!  He knows how to organize the words & lyrics to make it a great performance!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Interesting story.  Not over done on the computer graphics.  Its isn't a over the top action movie, has good story line.  And like the twist at the end.  Wasn't easy to figure out.  Worth a watch.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great series I am definitely hooked. Would recommend this series to those who liked twilight or the Hunger games.  On the third book and it definitely leaves you wanting more.
B005LAII4E|4.0|Very much like all the other GI joe movies.  High action paced movie.  Save the world story line.  Nothing that makes it stand out from other action movies.  Movie is very dependant on computer graphics.  But graphics are well done.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I was expecting this to be a bit more action packed and it instead it starts out pretty slow.  I kept waiting for something significant to happen at first until you realize that is the pace of the movie.  By the end it grew more suspenseful but still it was all in the final scenes.  There is some action, love, and the classic sci fi twist to make it better than just okay.  Definitely a movie I kept thinking about after seeing, turning the plot over in my mind, but not something I'll choose to see over and over.
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|The movie was great. Had me on the edge of my seat all the time. Have seen it twice now and enjoyed it both times. Plot twists, anxiety, impossible situations resolved. Usual sarcasm from actors, which I love. Worth it!
0399255370|5.0|My daughter is 10, but this book is funny and really enjoyable.  What a great sense of humor the writer has.  Not just a &#34;kid&#34; book...my husband & I also giggled on every page!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I think this movie should be shown in all schools starting at the 8th grade level and  I would like to see this movie  be a requirement for  immigrants studying for citizenship.  I really appreciated the historical accuracy and the effort for  authenticity. Just the aging process for the story's characters was fascinating.  Made me very appreciative of the sacrifices made to make America the best and greatest country on the planet.  One of the very best movies I've seen.  So glad I bought it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Challenging, but not too challenging. I can enjoy the game without having to worry about what level I am at.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Excellent, excellent story. Well written. I am downloading the next book right now. Brandon Sanderson is a wonderful story teller.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This is not debatable, nothing even comes remotely close. It has it all. Bogart and Bergman plus intrigue and WW2.
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|What a great, quirky movie!  Really good characters, phenomenal ending, etc. Far better than I expected! Not for younger kids, but adults and older teens will enjoy it!
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Tom Clancy has continued the Jack Ryan Jr storyline brilliantly. I cannot wait for the next installment in the series!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|The program will not open.  It shows connecting to server and then closes half way through. I wish it would open, based on other reviews it sounds like a good game.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|We liked the modern sound track and the classic Art Deco design.  The wardrobe is phenomenal!!! It was a great movie!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put my kindle down.  Amazing.  Sexy fun read.  Enjoyed from beginning to end.  I have recommended the series to others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is absolutely amazing!!!! So much fun and very realistic! There is so much stuff to do so I recommend it highly :D
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loves the entire series.  The last book solidified what I needed to put an end to the story.  I couldn't put the book down.r
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have loved all of Khaled Hosseini's books so far ( The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns), but this one just topped my list as a favorite book! It is so well written and there are so many subtle details to the story that intertwine in almost an artistic way. And underlying this story are many themes of family and love and acceptance that really hit close to home. I really recommend this book to anyone who is living away from their family and knows how hard it is not to be able to share with them every moment of every day.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book so fast because of how engaging the story and premise were. You are treated to a story filled with brutal realism, suspense, lies, and hope. A fantastic read for anyone who loves science fiction.
B001TW68P4|5.0|Love all the old hits and it brings back nice memories.<br />In comparison to other CD's, it had pretty much all their hits on.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|U can't look up certain words! So maybe next time u should put a list of the words in the back. Just saying.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME IT'S  THE ONLY  GAME THAT I REALLY LOVE PLAYING , I LOVE THE  THE CHALLENGE OF PLAYING THIS GAME .
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I learned a LOT about people struggling in Afganstan from this author's 2 previous books and really enjoyed them. This one was not up with the first two at all for me. But...I will be looking  for his next one!  Vel
B0050DIWFC|1.0|It was so boring I could not finish it.  I skipped to the last chapter to see how the story ended.
0545265355|5.0|These books are amazing! And the condition they came in was perfect. I'm super happy with what I received, and glad that I can read some of my favorite books over and over on paper.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|It was interesting to see what life was like in England at this time for a young girl my daughter's age
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Movie is visually stunning, acting was OK, special effects very good, plot was OK to good, but movie seemed to go on a bit too long. Integrating all this info gives about a 3.5 to 4.0 out of 5 stars. I am a sci fi fan, so I appreciated the rather slow start to this visually arresting movie. The plot is OK, but it does not take long to figure out what's going to happen if you've seen enough sci fi flicks. Special effects were very good also. I found the ending kind of \\"fakey\\" and somewhat abrupt however. Would these smart aliens/extra terrestrials/or their intelligence or computer technology not see what's coming ahead of time? After all, they tricked the earth and its people into becoming a wasteland, thereby feeding their technology and energy needs years ago. Overall, it was worthwhile watching. Just slow. Finally, with apologies to Judy Collins, \\"Send In the Clones\\".
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My grandchildren have now watched this movie about 5 times in 4 days. They love it and it has a great message for young and old alike.
B00004YA66|5.0|I love the movie and this product does not disappoint!  The box and disc labeling are great.  The duplication process produced a quality viewing experience.  It is great!
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Amazon's video-streaming is high-quality and the Tudors is no exception.  My husband and I love this show and while it's not 100% historically accurate, I've learned about English history a lot from watching.
B00632HWOG|5.0|So far I'm very pleased with Yahoo mail. It works great on my Kindle Fire and I'm really pleased to have it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|After all of the hype and hearing about the tv show I decided to read the series before watching the show.... And it's amazing!!! More of a murder mystery thriller than a typical high school drama read. Love it!!! Can't wait to finish the next book. :)
B004UID2LC|5.0|I installed the Youtube app on my smarphone and it works great. How handy to access youtube videos. Highly recommend it.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It might jump around a bit too much and though all lives seem to be connected in the end, it would have been fun to build that up just a bit more. Otherwise I did find myself smiling and suggested it to a few co-workers. If it's good enough to talk about the next day, it was worth my time.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|this would be a good item, except on the sixth disc there is a gouge deep and long enough for two episodes not to play properly. will end up selling this to shop that deals in used items. and ordering again.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I really love this show.  I started the first season recommended by a friend, and now I'm hooked.<br />I'm quickly learning not to get attached to anyone.  Everybody dies.  LOL
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|I kept waiting for the different story lines to be revisited; I wasn't prepared for the multiple vignettes. All along I expected them to connect or be expanded, so I was left wanting more of each. But the pieces combine in a satisfying way in the end.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I thought I'd hate this movie, but it turned out to be really good.  It was really an on the edge of your seat scary movie.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|the story moves at a great pace... it's almost like being there.<br />I am sure I will read more by Sanderson !
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book.  My daughter loved this book, my best friend loved this book.  Only read it when you have some time, as you wont be able to put it down!  Also have plenty of tissues at the ready!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I expected not to like this.  I'm not a zombie fan.  But I smiled and laughed several times throughout the movie.  Cute!
B001NLF2ZI|5.0|This was an outstanding preformance by both Nicole and Sean, and tells the story of the antparthid movement in South Africa.<br />I would reccomend
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Oh how I love Johnny Depp,,he could take nearly any character and make them adorable.  Even his movies that get bad reviews always end up being good to me.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|My 8 yr old daughter collects MH dolls and this is a great new addition! Great buy! Colors are beautiful and Dustin is adorable!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Loved, Loved, Loved Life of Pi.  The cinematography was incredible.  Wish I would have gone to see it on the big screen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 8 yr old daughter's new favorite game!!! It's all she wants to do after school. Graphics are pretty good
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Big deal!  So, I watched the show for the bodies.  I wasn't disappointed. I didn't expect much of a story line and wasn't disappointed.  Funny, I bought the movie...there are parts you just want to pause and look at a bit longer and harder (no pun intended).
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My 8 yr old loves all things Dr Panda and plays this game alot! I like to also, whenever I can get a turn! LOL
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Will any other future shows compare?  I'll so miss Dexter and his dark traveler.  I do like the role of the sister, but I hate how foul her mouth is.
B008B68IEA|5.0|Adorable accessories and hours of play for my 8 yr old. Very detailed and cute. Great addition to the MH collection.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|I put off watching this for YEARS because I thought it was a kiddie movie. It wasn't.  It was awesome.  I'm going to watch it again.  I liked the subtle moral back stories too.
B0091QS88K|5.0|My 8 yr old loves all things Dr Panda and plays this game alot! I like to also, whenever I can get a turn! LOL
B0078N2MTE|3.0|So I watched this in several parts....so expecting the end to be Grand.  What the heck?  I just didn't get it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I end up playing this every chance I can...totally addictive.  Waiting for the bits is only thing that gets slow.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Great, excellent and spooky! I a  a horror movie buff but lately I have been let down by a few recent PG-13 horror movies. This one is raw, gory, and R rated not only that but the story is scary and it works well as far a s horror elements are concerned. The actors did a great job playing their roles and me and my wife enjoyed this movie very much!! I will be buying this on blu ray asap!!!
B004P8A7J2|5.0|This is one of those fantastic films that every tween/teen should be made to watch before they engage in the glamourous world of drug use.  With drug addiction, there are no happy endings. This film does a wonderful job of making that apparent.
B008JFUR10|5.0|THis was one of the best action movies of the summer I would recommend this to any action movie lover. The story was good, it wasn't overly done just good enough to keep you entertained and the actors played their roles excellent. Everything made sense in the movie as well oh and did I forget to say that there was a lot of action! Go se this in the theaters before it goes out.
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|I really enjoy this movie. It's got some &#34;Rocky&#34; moments, but I enjoyed Rocky too. It's a good watch. I put it on the other day and had planned on taking a nap because I'd seen it before. I ended up watching the entire movie again. Love Tom Hardy.
B00D7OMNXS|4.0|I thought this one was way better than the 2nd. Good story and great action its just when I think when they try to be funny it doesn't work sometimes but otherwise I enjoyed it a lot! I recommend this to any Marvel comic movie buff. Another thumbs up for Marvel!
0345525558|5.0|It was a really nice story!  Really enjoyed learning the meaning behind each flower!  As a gardner it was a great read!
B009R89AA2|5.0|Amazing book that cuts across all age group in having a great laugh @ the wimpy kid's journal. Well done
0802473156|4.0|This is a nice book to read with your significant other!  It either confirms /affirms what you know about your partner or it helps you to refocus your energy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|i was over the phrase &#34;don't bite your lip&#34; by the 3rd chapter. By the 9th chapter I was done. I was wondering what all the hype was about. Not worth reading in my book.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|How could you wind up with this movie as an end result with F. Scott Fitzgerald's beautiful 1925 novel as source material, all the money in Hollywood and a number of top actors at your disposal? Wooden and flat- the beauty and subtly of the original story is painted in garish colors with every last detail spelled out for you- I sat through it once, but will never watch it again. The 1974 movie with screenplay by Coppola with Redford and Mia Farrow still stands as the classic screen version of this amazing story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its tons of fun and it is great to play when you are sitting at home bored
B00384N5GQ|5.0|Am pleased with the film and dvd's quality. I can highly recommend it, especially for families struggling in similar situations.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I loved the story line. True to the original as well. I can't wait until the next one comes out.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|The action scenes are good, it keeps you interested throughout the movie. I would recommend this movie to my friends
B0087GJ8KM|3.0|I found the material predictable or already approached elsewhere. That said the author does bring together interesting sources and reposition some ideas with new energy. I enjoyed reading a potted history of sales and how to be constructive but honestly expected more ooomph. Still it's can't be easy to write a sales book without being cheesy and Mr. Pink (surely a great name for a salesman) treads the line well.
0770437400|5.0|Brooks is presenting the zombie plague as a parable. His background argument is that in fact we do not plan based on probability, but on stupidity and denial. As such, we can expect to be totally unprepared when a crisis hits.<br /><br />This book really is about misallocation of resources, failure of strategic vision and dialogue, and construction of ideas and institutions and systems for national and international security that are not proportionate to risk. The big threats include climate change, epidemics, uncontrolled population movement and military dictatorship.<br /><br />Something similar to the zombie plague may well be coming if we continue to fail to plan. The pending catastrophe will not contradict the laws of science, but rather show the inevitable and remorseless fulfilment of scientific prophecy.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|Get your act together, Amazon -- or else you won't be in the game to compete with iTunes! The version downloaded (both the free and the free with license) did not work and were not the correct version. I had to go to Google Play to get the correct / workable version -- which I love!
B006M4F67A|3.0|So far it seems to work OK as I noted I have not  had a chance to fully test it.<br />So far so good
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I read a sample and now I am hooked!! Awesome book and awesome plot line! You guys should read it
B00CATSONE|5.0|Most of the book covers facts about Tesla that I already knew having been in electronics for over 30 years.<br />There were items in this well written book that I did not know and was pleased to find out more of this genius.<br />To this day i cannot imagine how this person could conceive ideas in his head, about how things we take for granted today.<br />He should be up there with Newton , Maxwell, and Hertz .
B0035S996U|5.0|Falsely accused of murdering a gang leader, The Warriors kick butt on every other gang they run into as they fight their way home.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent story of a man and the coping skills he uses to find his way back to life on solid ground.
B00ESY77LO|1.0|One of the great books of the twentieth century flushed down the drain by overblown egos and the theory that story should always be a distant second to spectacle if you want to make a buck.  There is really nothing to say about this mess of a movie except that it's a sad commentary on today's movies that it even got made.  Watch the Redford &#34;Gatsby&#34; from 1974 -- much, much better.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|An excellent, entertaining read. Thoroughly enjoyed the old English in this truly romantic tale.  Will expand your vocabulary. read and enjoy.
B000002IJL|5.0|I'm a big fan of the music from this era.  Just watched the movie recently and enjoyed it and the music!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Although it sucks up battery enrgy rapidly, I like the wide view of what I'm filming and not having to use the remote control that came with camera. A must have accessory, in my opinion.
B000XXGMS8|5.0|I've been wanting a pair of these for a long time, and finally I bought these and I couldn't be happier. I took other's advice and bought a size smaller and they fit perfect.
B00DW36G32|3.0|I thought the plot was kinda weak but the scenery was beautiful. the way it ended was like thats it its over
B00CTNUMPO|5.0|It's Walt Disney!!!!  What's mot to love about it.  Great effects, animation and story.  Fun for all ages.  We have EVERY Walt Disney movies that has been released in our collection both in DVD and Blu-ray.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|it's typical english detective drama from ITV. if you like such a category, e.g. inspector lewis, endeavour, inspector lynley, you will love it.
B00DW36G32|4.0|Predictable but highly etertaining. Most anyone would enjoy an evening in front of this movie on their entertainment center. Recomend all friends to view.
B006FE83UE|5.0|what a wonderful movie to add to you're collection. I saw this movie when I was 13 and I did not understand the story that it was telling me , now I'm way over sixty and I have done the audio book, I now have the movie and I have a big smile on my face.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Haven't played a good tablet game like this in a while. Yay for Gameloft. (^____^  )
B004YCKK6Y|1.0|Now the only reason I got this movie is because my daughter said it was really funny, it's Quentin Tarentino mom! Well to my dismay it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen . So now she has a new movie for her collection. And the funny thing about it is that she was shocked that I did not like it......thumbs down.....oh well..I'm the one with the dry sense of humor and I guess it does not fit well with Quentin Tarentino.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  Kept me riveted and surprised at each turn  I highly recommend the whole series
B001AX9DT0|4.0|This cd is awesome. There are a lot of really good songs on it. If you like Ray LaMontagne  this is a must to your collection. If you don't know if you like him this is a good cd to find out. You won't be disappointed.
0634089358|5.0|Like most  of Hal Leonards books, this is a  good way for a beggining bass player to learn assorted blues riffs.  It covers 12-bar blues, shuffles, boogie bassas well as intros, turnarounds and assorted endings.  Good slow selection to sample from.  Any beginner blues bass player would appreciate this book.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|This really could be a good app, if it wasn't for the many freezes.  I can't enjoy it much because it freezes and I can't find my downloaded items. So disappointed and I'm about to take it off my device.  Smh
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is the current &#34;last&#34; book in the series to come out.  from all the reviews I read many people were disappointed that this book didn't conclude the series.  I liked it, but I purchased all three books together and had me a good ole Gideon Cross &#34;rock my world&#34; party.  I would take Gideon hands down, who cares what his problems are?  In fact before the next book comes out i plan on sitting down and having another Gideon party and read all 3 books again!  ENJOY!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The characters were great! Lots of different personalities. The pace was good, the story was rich and believable. Made me think how life can change so quickly. How good people can go bad and how when faced with decisions we make unbelievable choices.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|While I enjoyed Evolver, I like many of John's fans was disappointed in that it did not reach the commercial /radio play success that his previous albums did. The songs were good but did not stand out...<br /><br />On this new release, John Legend has reflected on his past and has for the most part created a new album that sonically is new (Made to Love is brilliant) while containing tracks like \\"All of Me\\" that should have the same impact that \\"Ordinary Love\\" had.<br />There are many great gems.<br /><br />I would recommend the deluxe version because it has the duet with Seal, \\"We Love It\\" plus another strong ballad, \\"For the First Time.\\"<br /><br />2 disappointments, however, missing is the upbeat track \\"Tonight (Best You Ever Had)\\" Ft Ludacris and \\"Dance the Pain Away\\" which he did with EDM DJ Benny Benassi.<br /><br />It still seems that both radio and his record company is trying to pigeon-hole John Legend as just a great slow to mid-tempo ballad/singer yet his voice lends itself to electro/dance music and that path would give him a wider audience base.<br /><br />I only wish that the deluxe cd was not package in the cheap/disposable paper packaging which usually helps to damage/scratch the cd. Why is the regular version housed in the far superior standard case instead of vice-versa?
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Open and honest. So very sorry for what transpired over your life. Amazingly strong woman. Courageous and loving to her daughter's and for her daughter's. Bravo on your recovery!
B006LSZECO|3.0|There's something to be said for an author who can get under the reader's skin and actually make them feel something for the Book even when your not reading it, but I'm not sure I want to feel this way about every book I read.  I liked the way this story was told, the writing was excellent.  I had feelings for the characters and wanted to find out what happens to them.  I was unable to guess the twists, so was always being surprised.  However, the whole time I was reading Gone Girl, I felt slightly uncomfortable.  Finally, I absolutely hated the way the author chose to \\"end\\" her tale, and this is why I'm giving Gone Girl only 3 Stars.  I recommend it, but warn you to read at your own risk.
B008J05EL8|3.0|It is a good product.  It was not what I really needed.  I should have chosen better for me and my needs.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I have read the two previous books by this author and really enjoyed them.  This book was hard to follow and appeared very disjointed.  There were several story lines that didn't necessarily weave together.  It took me a while to figure out who was who and who was the book really about.  I'm not sure that I ever knew that--even when the book was through.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is great to have the Bible so assessible and easy to get to.  The format is great.  It is good to have the Bible in the palm of your hand and it not weigh 3 or 4 pounds.
140006922X|5.0|This book is definitely not for close-minded, extremely literal Christians.  I found it to be highly enlightening and factually based.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|This is another wonderful British program aimed at thinking adults. No super skinny bimbos in designer clothes mangling silly story lines.  Just intelligent scripts well produced and acted.
B00EH6SK78|5.0|Probably the most underrated band in the metal scene.  Dez and the boys put forth another pulverizing effort filled with the groove and grind that makes DevilDriver the cool band that they are.  Well worth the money.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works well so far for Windows PC and Android tablet.  Not so well for Apple devices.  But I guess this is expected.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I trust these headphones and will replace or repair them if they are ever damaged.  I am also curious about the Quincy Jones AKG headphones -- If Quincy puts his name on them, they've got to meet his standards.  So, several AKG K 240 headphones and some closed-back AKG phones for certain applications and one set of Quincy Jones headphones would be my next Bday wish.
B000J103PC|5.0|Love this movie. Very entertaining and contains my 3 favorite actors. Meryl Streep, Ann Hathaway and Emily Blunt.<br />Great movie to add to my library.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As always John Corey delivers.  The sharp tongued, skeptical detective is on his game in this intriguing adventure.  All the characters are believe able as are the incidents they find themselves confronting.  Can't wait for the next book...
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I've never been a fan of this group, the first album was to my humble opinion very commercial and very easy music to listen (of course if you are a metal head!).  On their second album the music was more technical and for me American Capitalist was a great evolution of the band.  Honestly I wasn't very convinced that they could stick to their style and improve American Capitalist, well, they have.  This last album is more profound, better lyrics and why not, the balladas are great also.  I'm a big fan of In This Moment and the duet with Maria Brink on Anywhere but Here song is great.  Great job for FFDP.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I mean, who doesn't love those minions?  The story is good too and is family friendly.  Watch it for the minions though.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|read this for bookclub and really enjoyed it.  Had a good discussion Have read his first too books also and enjoyed them.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|My little girl is a huge fan of this movie...it is cute and has upbeat music. It is nice for her to have this on her kindle while we travel.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Am addicted to the game.  My battery runs out before I want to quit.  Haven't played with any one else except the computer so far
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I was delighted to see that the author backed up his writing with actual quotes from the bible.<br /><br />Truthfully, I think The Zealot was John The Baptist...and the Messiah also.<br /><br />Hurray for backing up my views that Saint Paul was a dreadful person who thought he was the Messiah.<br /><br />So many Messiahs....so little time.<br /><br />This critique is from a woman who does not believe in any organized religion and thinks the bible is a myth.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|at first i wasnt going to watch it because the only option was to buy it. but then i remembered how much i loved the first one and the second one was just as good if not better!!! i cant wait for number 3!!!
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My grand kids love this game.  I have several games on my phone for them but this is the one they continue to play.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Finally a story that does not require sex to sell it and leaves you with a &#34;Justice Done right&#34; at the end with out killing anyone
0307236722|5.0|I love this book. I have all books of Martha Stewart, and all her recipes are perfect! The Best : Blueberry Muffins! I am anxiously awaiting your Book of Cakes!
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|An interesting reinterpretation of a Star Trek classic.  Worth watching, but some bits were too tongue in cheek.  No lighting glare as in the previous movie, so a much more enjoyable viewing experience.  Very little Chekov and Sulu.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This was a sad excuse for a book. I liked the first two this felt thrown together. There was no real plot except sex and poorly written sex at that.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Tom Cruise needs to relearn how to act.  He has a set of stock expressions and responses, and that's it.  He's so full of himself, you can never accept the character he's trying to portray.  All you see is the bad acting.  Without him, this movie may have had legs.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Started watching this series and couldn't stop.  It was a great time piece.  Love the contrast of the &#34;upstairs&#34; and &#34;downstairs&#34;
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Consensus:<br />Asphalt 8: Airborne<br />Made by Gameloft<br />$0.99 for iPad and iPhone universal app<br />5 stars<br /><br />Asphalt 8: Airborne is a well-polished game that is easy and fun to play. Gameloft has, in effect, rebooted the entire Asphalt franchise by using a fresh new graphics engine (because the one in Asphalt 7 created the effect of driving a matchbox car.) They've also added two new game modes, that, while they provide change, aren't that interesting. The first of these is called Drift Gate. In this mode, you have to drift through many little \\"gates\\" to rack up your score. I wasn't impressed. The second of these modes is called Infected. If you are caught in last place for more than, say, 10 seconds, you get \\"infected\\". That means you have to ram as many cars as possible while making sure your timer does not run out. One of the main selling points of this game is the new tracks. They completely revamped the Tokyo track from A6 and A7, and they added different ones like French Guinea and Nevada while they scrapped my favorite track, Los Angeles. Oh well. The other main selling point for this game is the jumps and stunts, which are well worth your money. Flat spins and barrel rolls are now part of this iconic mobile franchise. The one drawback of this game is the muddled and slightly confusing GUI. The buttons are reminiscent of Word 2013 in their square and stark white look, and the interface has changed since A6 and A7. But, overall this game is a steal at $0.99. The only thing I think it's missing is iPad 3 retina support. Future update maybe?
B00A27X972|3.0|Simple, and straight forward. A light read for the summer, and a consistent effort on the author's part. Next time.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Hi &#34;you win  agin&#34;BeeGees.This CD contains a lot of Hits of BeeGees,you will played it again and again!Love itso much!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|If it is late at night and want to watch something that you don't need to think about this is for you.
B007LGPSX0|4.0|I loved this series on Amazon Prime! The sound was great, the quality was great and it really focused on the issues that still happen today but in a very entertaining way! I loved it!! 💜 The only thing that was annoying was that in every episode at least two to three times it would randomly go out of focus but overall it was amazing!!!!
B007THA4FI|3.0|Great writing and great characterization. Read only if you intend to slowly digest the plot and character interactions. Not a quick read.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A must-read adventure for any person who loves video games. The main characters were engaging and left the reader feeling like he or she had some new friends. It was a page turner in a virtual reality like you have never imagined. Loved it!<br />(And I am not a gamer myself)
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|good flick, never expected the ending. It kept you guessing who the real villains were. The tech was very interesting, but where did they get seeds at the end?
B005LAIISU|5.0|And the saga goes on...this one has a little more action and &#34;fight&#34; scenes due to the faithful audience that might have grown up but it is still very enjoyable by the whole family.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|The story was so light and entertaining at times whilst simultaneously dealing with issues around disability.  The characters drew one in and the story lived on in my mind for days.  This was the first book I've read by JoJo Moyes and as a result have subsequently read another 3.  Definitely worth reading!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|As good as or better than Asimov's federation stories. I expect to find out that the tree cats has their own agenda some day
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its A great App of the Bible Indeed Can't say more.. except That I Love It! would Recommend to my friends
B00AKFG15S|2.0|I enjoyed the first two books in the Clifton Chronicles, so was eagerly awaiting this latest instalment. Must say it was a bit of a disappointment, both for the corny story lines and the formulaic writing style. Definitely airline fodder and I won't bother with the next two instalments!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Not as good as season 3, but still great! I definitely recommend it, I love this series-so good, for sure!
0984999302|5.0|This Book coupled with the Free Online Course should be required reading if you are starting a company. Excellent resource for Start Up CEOs.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a good first game of a good game series. In fact I give it a ten out of ten. I also recommended it to any gamer even those who are not interested in hidden object type games.
B00640UICA|5.0|Joining Hands is a fun game, gets more challenging as you advance.  It is a good game to play if you have extra time.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Strong character development through courtroom and personal encounters make this a great dramatic series. We only starting watching this show after it appeared on Amazon Prime streaming videos.  Great acting and storylines make this a five star series.
B0084670FU|1.0|Slow, tedious, boring.  Not enough character development; didn't care about the outcome. Not worth the time it took to watch it.
1623650003|4.0|An attractive young woman is abducted on the streets of Paris. A witness sees her being bundled into an anonymous white van, but no one knows who she is or where she has been taken. Camille Verhoeven (a male detective) is assigned the case, despite disturbing parallels in the abduction of his wife several years earlier. Gradually, through extensive police work, the detectives close in on the case and uncover the motivations of the kidnapper. In alternative chapters, we are shown what Alex, the kidnap victim, is going through - trapped and left to die in a small cage in a remote location.<br /><br />This is a fast paced thriller which is broken into three distinct parts. The plot is cleverly constructed. Each part leads the reader to totally re-evaluate everything that they've read until now and to see the characters in quite different lights to how they were presented earlier. There are some very clever twists along the way. It all adds up to one of the more original and absorbing thrillers that I've read in some time.<br /><br />The book was originally written in French and is the middle book in a trilogy (although a fourth book is apparently now planned), but it is the first book by the author to be translated into english. Although there is the occasional clunky sentence, for the most part you don't notice it, which I think is the mark of a good translation.<br /><br />Warning: Some of the content is quite unpleasant to read.  There is graphic violence and torture.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Good movie, but really not great.  Good movie for the entire family.  Leonardo did a great acting job, but it's a long movie.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I had read a very short synopsis of the movie which said it was about a man who used a riding lawnmower to travel 300 miles to visit his brother. This sounded like something that my wife might enjoy so I rented it mostly for her; what I didn't expect was the power house of production and acting that makes this movie an amazing and memorable experience.<br /><br />A review of this movie requires one pull out many terms not often used of movies today, gentle, tender, sensitive, introspective, great direction, great acting, thoughtful, and non-violent for starters. It reminded me in some respects of \\"Enchanted April\\" where time is given to quiet moments of beauty and calm; where the camera lingers on a gentle moment filled with the beauty of just that moment.<br /><br />During the movie I commented to my wife that it didn't feel like I was watching acting, I was watching life being lived before my eyes. I had the impression that this was really happening as I watched; I almost had to remind myself that I was watching actors of extraordinary ability reciting lines, playing a part, that this was not reality.<br /><br />Also interesting, as I think back on the movie, is it never lost that sense of relaxed reality; the pace of the movie always seemed to move naturally with no rushing through the quiet moments. Facial expressions were allowed to speak to the viewer and tell of the inner emotions at play in the character.<br /><br />If you rush through life without stopping to smell the flowers you will probably find this movie moves too slowly; if, on the other hand, you like to enjoy the beauty of the flowers, the beauty of a sunset, a quiet moment watching the crackling of a fire in the evening, then this movie may well please and delight you as it pleased and delighted me.<br /><br />To fully enjoy this movie it is helpful if one has enjoyed some years of living, younger children may not be able to relate to the subtler moments featured in the telling of this beautiful and touching story.nd touching story.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast must be set up from a wireless device.  If you try to follow the instructions on your ethernet-wired desktop to set it up, you will get an error saying, &#34;No big deal, but your wifi is off.&#34;  This refers to your computer, not the dongle itself.  Once I downloaded the iOS Chromecast app from Apple on my iPhone I was able to get the device to connect.  Once set up, the desktop computer running Google Chrome can &#34;cast&#34; to the Chromecast.  In this case you will need to download the Google Cast Extension to your Chrome browser.  It will automatically find your Chromecast device and allow streaming from the browser.<br /><br />Unfortunately, two phone calls to Chromecast support failed to even ask me how the computer I was using to set up was connected to the internet... a very important and obvious thing to ask it seems to me!  One rep actually told me my router wouldn't work unless I turned off security (not an issue since Chromecast is compatible with both WEP and WAP).  Another rep sent me an email with instructions on how to install from an Android phone when I specifically told her I had an iPhone.  I suppose the tech support will catch up as these devices become more common and are used by non-techies.<br /><br />All it all, if you read all you can (the reviews here are very helpful and accurate) and understand what it can and cannot do, you will be happy with this device.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I always liked Tom Cruise, this is my fave yet of his, great acting, f/x, nice story, hot babes.  Nice twist and turns, somewhat predictable but still worthy of 5 stars.  Rented it and watched it twice.  Going to purchase on bluray.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|The combination of the lights and sound were wonderful! This is a game to test speed and acknowledge shapes and size. The whole family had fun taking turns and helping each other. Great for getting kids to work motor skills fitting shapes and size.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This classic story never looses its appeal. I really enjoyed the kindle edition from Amazon. I like the book much better than any movie.
B007AL48UK|4.0|I loved playing this game as the summer ends. I gave a lighter feeling to the changing of leaves with fun objects to match. My 4 yr old granddaughter loved find the buckets for the sand and the other beach object. She related to them when we started to search for shells and build sand castles on the beach.
B0017VQB40|5.0|Can't be much of a surprise to anyone reading about WSS.  Great musical!  My daughter loves it too.  She dances around the living room to it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart series. Characters pull you in to the story. Love the fast paced dialogue and the development of the relationships over time.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The game has good graphics and story. I like the RPG genre and absolutely love this game. I would like to see more games like this one.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Dustin Hoffman created a Dustin Hoffman Hook. What an amazing transformation. :) I never imagined he could give such a vibrant color to Hook.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|I have read the 1st two books and dont think this one is as enjoyable. Mind I'm not into stories about people who are on the verge of mental breakdowns and having debilatating guilt trips over things they have had to do.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I enjoyed reading Plum Island very much, even though I expected a few more surprises. John Corey's sarcasm can be a little over done at times but I still love his character.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|When it's predicted to rain, for instance, we need better graphics and some description.  A tiny little 'bolt' below a cloud drawing doesn't quite do it for me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great show!  The cast is perfect!  I don't like waiting so long for the next season to start.
B004CURZFC|4.0|It's a good family movie with beautiful picture.<br />My 4 year old son loved it.<br />For me it's weird how the owls are talking though. :)
B00A285OOW|3.0|Not as good as the White Queen.  The princess was weak and seems spineless.  Ended abruptly.  Not worth the wait.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Having never read any of the Harry Potter books, and only being able to tolerate the first movie, ( I am an adult...) I thoroughly enjoyed this book. In this age of complaining about poor people acting entitled, it was refreshing to read about the way life really is for some people, and to show some of the compassion that can be given, if people just open their eyes to what is around them. I loved the book, loved the characters, loved Ms. Rowlings writing style. I hope she writes more books for adults in the future. Highly recommend this book!!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|What a great book with unexpected content and theory. Very educational, enlightening and enjoyable read. I would recommend this book highly
B00B19H2KU|4.0|Stereotypical possession with a Jewish twist. Interesting not too morbid. Some thematic elements but overall just suspenseful and not too long.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|My husband and I watched this when we were young, now my kids are thrilled to have discovered it.  This movie is wonderful and entertaining as much today as it was when it came out.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I truly love watching this show. I find it interesting and engaging. I watch every chance I get and I have watched it more than once
B00985E3UG|5.0|The book is very good. I wish there was more evolutionary biology in the book. I would read other books by this author.
B0094KTAEY|2.0|I totally remembered thus movie differently and watching it with my son.... I kept the remote handy to fast forward through all the mean neighbor kid parts. I asked him if he wanted to watch it again. He said no, that he wanted to watch Kipper! : )
1596680180|5.0|I don't know why I didn't get this sooner.  I've been making cord and working with cord to make jewelry for about 6 years.  I thought I'd take a look at this book by Jacqui Carey who wrote one of the books on kumihimo that I use a lot.  I love that this book has a spiral  binding so that it lies down flat and open so I can work and refer to the illustrations.  It also has four different types of working with the cords-great!
B003B02O0A|4.0|I enjoyed &#34;A Time to KIll&#34; very much.  John Grisham is my favoroite author and has done a good job on this book.
B00DYZ2YVG|5.0|The main character, Daniel, finds himself thrust into the center of the zombie apocalypse and fighting waves of zombies.<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of the traditional zombies or the newer age of zombies, you'll enjoy this face-paced and action-packed journey.<br /><br />A 5 star read of what happens when an experiment goes wrong.<br /><br />**As with most of my reviews, I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review**
B008OM0EDO|1.0|if you value your time than do not waste it on this movie. It has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. 15 minutes was all I could take.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|What if you were forced to die every night? Not just die, but experience a horrible, painful death that was different each time. What would something like that do to your mind, especially if you're a teenager?<br /><br />&#34;Outview&#34; by Brandt Legg tackles this in a fantasy-type setting with 16-year-old, Nate.<br /><br />This is a well-written book that delves into some deep new-age topics. If you're a firm believer in reincarnation, this book will snag you from the beginning, and even if you don't, the wild ride of this epic YA Sci-Fi will keep you hooked.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|First off, for a NIN album, \\"Hesitation Marks\\" comes off as strikingly minimalistic. This coming from Trent Reznor, a man not known for restraint. As a whole the songs are guided by thumping beats, loops, and the characteristic haunting background noise. Where are the guitars? Seriously, the guitar work is \\"Without Teeth\\". But they're still sort of audible, buried below the surface. Reznor has abandoned the hopeless shrieking despair and sounds content. Good for him. I admire this album because it's not a punishing experience to sit through. That's right, God forbid, a serviceable NIN album. The horror! \\"Came Back Haunted\\" provided a solid glimpse into where Reznor was headed, and it's a great song. Their best radio song since \\"The Perfect Drug\\". If you liked \\"Came Back\\", get the album. Only those still expecting songs that make you want to bash your head into a mirror and carve your wrist with the shards will be disappointed.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a great read all emotions were expressed. I would highly recommend the book for persons who enjoy reading
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I bought this game for the iPad on my because it was nit available for the Android at the time. It is just as good and my daughter loves playing it. She can sit there for a good amount of time cutting and then growing the hair or curling it and dying the hair color. For the joy that she gets out if it I thought it was a good purchase. It runs smooth on my kindle fire hd and HTC one.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Ludlum , one of the masters of the genre.  What a thrill ride... Ordering the second and third books now.
B00C50NV2M|4.0|I purchased 3 pairs of the Sony TDG-500P Passive 3 D Glasses in addition to the 4 pairs that is included with Sony's 70 inch 3D TV. They are very lightweight and really brings the 3D image out of the TV. Two piece assembly, meaning snapping the lens to the headband. Unlike the heavier previous glasses, you won't notice any discomfort with the TDG-500P and at times forget you even have them on. I would recommend these to others. Even now, everytime I go to Costco I put on their display 500-P's and watch thereir TV dispaly in 3D for up to 5 minutes, before moving on to do other shopping.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I have seen The Goonies a hundred times and I could watch a hundred more. It never gets old and always gets better. By far the best movie ever made.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This is a great bag. There are plenty of pockets . . . zippered, open, velcro, mesh, solid, small, medium, large - I've finally got enough pockets to organize all of my stuff. I'm using it for a small laptop (13 ' MacBook) but it fits securely.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loving this DVD! haven't had a chance to watch special features yet, but the show itself is enough. High recommend
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is a must required forever read!  I read this book, re-read this book then re-read the highlights and bookmarks I made again in my Kindle... each time, it's a deeper, faster, higher roller coaster of emotions that runs through my body - in sections that I have read over and over, I cringe, knowing the words that will come next- not sure if I can read them again...with my heart beating faster and faster, flinching from my Kindle screen, not sure if I can go through the heart-wrenching emotions again...but I do, talking myself through it - remembering the ending I so loved.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy and Travis Maddox are complicated characters that are driven, smart, vulnerable and self-destructive.  I found myself worrying about them as if they were real people!<br /><br />The story is creative, funny and hauntingly sad in parts.  This book - as well as \\"Walking Disaster\\" is a FANTASTIC super enjoyable read that I will remember and reflect on for years to come.  Thank you Jamie McGuire!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show really draws you in and keeps you intrigued through all the twists and turns! Great actors in this show too.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK AND I ALWAYS WATCH THE MOVIE LITTLE WOMEN, ESPECIALLY THE ONE WITH JUNE ALLYSON AND MARGARET OBRIEN IN  THAT IS AN AWESOME MOVIE
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I tried ordering from Amazon but the wait was going on for over 1 month, cancelled my order and got it from Ebay for $42.00.<br />very easy to set up, took a minute.  I got it to work with my Kindle Fire, but it doesnt work with Windows Phone!<br />Thats ok, Streaming was fast and  very great quality. I use youtube mostly and netflix on this and for the first time using Google play movies..<br /><br />The problem is i used the beta option to stream file videos and my pc,, the lag is really bad and choppy--for me it doesnt work..<br /><br />Disappointed about that and that i cant watch amazon movies.. but for $35 you cant go wrong.. Looking fwd to amazon with making a similar device for even cheaper. :)
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|ozzy sounds great !happy happy happy! you are NEVER too old to rock & roll ! hope they do #14!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is great! It is super easy and has great challenges . You should totally buy it. HAVE A GREAT TIME!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|rockin' ! LOVE LOVE LOVE jerry cantrell kicks MAJOR BUTT!! wish layne was with 'em, this album would make him sooo proud!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|love this shows wit and class.  Characters are great and well thought out, clothing is awesome and always makes me insane with want.  I did not like the whole cat custody battle in this season it was just not up to the standards I have seen in the show thus far.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Interesting take on this point in history . Entertaining filling of holes during that time. Great  'sequel' to the white queen
B00457X7IQ|5.0|Really loved this book and found it hard to put down and will be looking for more of Kami Garcia Books
B003XVYLDU|4.0|First time reader of Kurt Vonnegut.  It took me a while to warm to his back and forth tale telling..so it goes.  The tales were creative, funny and insightful observations of many quirky interactions and behaviors between people.
B00358ESI4|5.0|The best movie out there for anyone who likes war movies. My wife doesn't even like war movies and loved this one.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Excellent show.....will have you hooked.  Don't know why I didn't watch this one before. Now I have something to do on Sunday nights. Looking forward to the new season.
0920668372|5.0|I read this book every night to my belly  (my unborn son) and I can't wait to read it to him when he's born...I cried the first time I read. I love this book.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've been enjoying King since the stand came my way in 1980,  and have never stopped. He is a master storyteller who gets into my being. I cried when Jake met Sadie in the last chapter. But the best, most beautiful line was ' dancing is life'
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a cute movie with a lot of things the 80s generation will recognize and find amusing. Totally worth the price.
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|Aside from a couple of tracks, this is a very nice step in the band's growth. Both David and Martin sing very well.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I was reluctant to watch this thinking it was another romance movie. I am so glad I did see it and I laughed a lot & I mean a lot. I would very highly recommend this movie to any one that likes to laugh!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Wonderful way to create lists that can be synced to multiple devices and, because it all saves to an account and not the device, can be backed up so that the loss of a paper list or a busted device is not an issue. If this could be combined with a basic calendar function for repeating to-do lists or setting deadlines for to-do list items it would be perfect.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Clean, detailed and pretty accurate. Especially considering Florida's inconsistent weather, this app has been a lifesaver. The multiple location aspect also gives me a good idea of what to expect when I'm driving.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Every bit as good as NFS, and more fun in several ways.  And at only 99 cents, we've bought it for every phone and tablet in the family.  Super Fun!!!
B005NFVZTM|4.0|Serisously, I have no idea why people made such a fuss about this movie, in my opinion this movie was great, not to mention visually striking! I loved how it was showing the different upbringing between magneto and charles. I will hush before i reveal things, but overall i am pleased with this movie!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The trilogy is just as good the sixth time you read it was the first. The story and the characters are lasting and will remain with you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game...it actually challenges your brain..makes you think and reason.I can't wait for the new levels to come out..
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|When allowed screen time, this game has been entertaining for not only the kids, but my husband as well.  It seems to be captivating for all ages and abilities.
B007N85POS|5.0|Everybody Happy Happy Happy. Good Stuff. We liked it. Will probably use it again. Keep selling the good stuff. Hollar.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I didn't think I could relate to a TV show about old houses in Europe and the people who live in them, but let me tell you: I LOVE DOWNTON ABBEY. The actors and writers of this series are absolutely awesome.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Everybody Happy Happy Happy. Good Stuff. We liked it. Will probably use it again. Keep selling the good stuff. Hollar.
B00ESY77LO|1.0|This movie was a total letdown and too long.  Ninety minutes is about all you are able to take before turning on HBO.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Everybody Happy Happy Happy. Good Stuff. We liked it. Will probably use it again. Keep selling the good stuff. Hollar.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|I liked the cool gadgets and advanced technology visuals, but that was about it.  There were still alot of story missing to make in real connection to why all of this happened.<br /><br />  I was left confused and may have to watch it again to see what I missed.  We watched it segmetedly as we have a 19 month old.  The movie was interesting and some of the action got my heart racing, but I would not necessarily compare this to something like Minority Report.<br /><br />  We are still glad we purchased it and would recommend it to sci-fi lovers.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Everybody Happy Happy Happy. Good Stuff. We liked it. Will probably use it again. Keep selling the good stuff. Hollar.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This was light, fun and a fast read. Cute story for young adult. I purchased it as a mental sorbet between two heavier courses of reading material.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Everybody Happy Happy Happy. Good Stuff. We liked it. Will probably use it again. Keep selling the good stuff. Hollar.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Started off a bit slow. I was a little hesitant about watching it since the advertising appeared to reflect something different from my taste.  That being said, it was a fabulous movie! Thought provoking and great story line and special effects!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Everybody Happy Happy Happy. Good Stuff. We liked it. Will probably use it again. Keep selling the good stuff. Hollar.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is an excellent story but having just finished the Wool series as well as many other Stephen King novels, the simplicity in grammar and the conversational language that the main character uses ended up bothering me far more than I expected.  Definitely would recommend this book, it's an excellent story, it just is definitely written for a Young Readers audience... and I never felt that way about the Harry Potter series.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Everybody Happy Happy Happy. Good Stuff. We liked it. Will probably use it again. Keep selling the good stuff. Hollar.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Disappointing to have the series end - and not the way I would have preferred.<br />I understand that Sookie would like a family someday, and doesn't want to be &#34;made&#34; into a vampire, but I so loved her with Eric.<br />I hoped that he would come up with some last minute solution to enable them to stay together.<br />The last 2 books seemed somewhat rushed to me -as though the author was under pressure/stress to get them finished.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|People have been bashing this app for having ads, but I disagree with their criticism. The devs do promote their other games within the app, but it's done tastefully. I haven't felt annoyed by them. When a dev produces a game with quality as high as this one, I'm almost always interested to see what other titles they have made.<br /><br />So, to be blunt: enjoy the game for what it is. If it injures your ego too much to play a game that advertises other games made by the same developer, you might as well spend your money elsewhere.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|The device works well, yet when you use it for just an iPod with Bluetooth, it drains the battery pretty fast also. I still like it because I can use it along with my phone that has bluetooth capability.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm practically bawling. This is a great read. I'm from Indy so I'm local to this story... but, WOW! a great piece of writing.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius keeps yo dreaming!<br />If you've love and lost that half of yourself, you can bring that love back in dreams.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I can honestly say, i don't think i ever had heard of Tintin before this movie came out.  Was looking for a movie for a rainy day to watch w/ family and came across it.  I remember hearing about it somewhat when it came out, and that it seemed to have positive reviews, so, we gave it a shot, and the kids loved it!  They want to watch it over and over.....definitely recommend.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|It is not the Doctor, but David Tennant is believable in the role and the mystery is worth watching.  If you like British shows, you will like Broadchurch.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Awesome game I have it on my DSi too and I love it its so awesome that it's on kindle Fire
1400069289|1.0|This book is mis-titled. It should be titled &#34; How to write pseudoscientific book with minimum effort&#34;. There are three steps:<br />1. Come up with a dubious behavioral theory.<br />2. Find well known turnaround events in addiction, sport, business etc.<br />3. List those events ad nauseum, no matter how tenuous the relationship to your theory.<br /><br />This is without doubt the worst non-fiction book I have read (sorry, half read)
B002361MLA|5.0|Best ever! Very inspirational and life changing. It has opened my to eyes to a new world of possibilities of spirituality!
B00271B752|5.0|Great story, amazing cast and it was all filmed in NYC. If you ever need ideas for costumes on holloween then this movie will give you plenty of inspiration.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|These are 3 great short stories. It definitely makes you wonder if you can solve the problem before the end of the story.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Cute graphics and nice addition collecting artefacts. Cartoons are a little silly and unnecessary but it's a fun game. Glad I caught it  when it was free.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|If you're expecting Harry Bosch, this doesn't have him in it. It's a goodread while waiting for the new stuff to come out.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|The anti-malware program I use listed this as having Intrusive Adware. Not sure I really wanna trust it to run any type of search for me. Uninstalled immediately!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I love the hidden objects in the game. Very mysterious and love the story line. Already addicted to it. May have to get more of their games.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The plot was well thought out and kept the viewer engaged by not disclosing everything at the beginning.  Wonderful special effects.  Sound and video were first class.
0345803493|5.0|I have truely loved this collection of 3 books, this being the second was quite good as well, if you like an erotic romance story that's well written, you will like it too.
B009ZQJ0ME|1.0|I could not get into this movie. I watched about 10 minutes and gave up.  I can't give a plot review.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|I love this cd, Susan Tedeschi has a very soulful voice, she reminds me of a young Bonnie Raitt, and Derek Trucks on slide guitar and the rest of their band is outstanding!!!
0525478817|4.0|Great read for YA and adults alike. A lot of emotion & deep thoughts for teens.  My own student said she couldn't read it in class because she didn't want to get upset, but she loved it overall.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|Fantastic movie!!  Barbra was great in it!!  She was as good as she was in Prince of Tides. She still has it.  Laughed a lot during this movie
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|AWESOME movie.lots of good acting and action. I like any kind of war movie. the movie is almost 3 hrs long so make a big batch of popcorn
B0026IUXME|5.0|I did not see this movie when it first came on the movie theater<br />At home with a pop corn i enjoyed, cried and felt this magnificent film<br />No one should miss it!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This a great book. I recommended to whoever loves, love stories,and the mystery of who is on your side who is not.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I really was expecting someone with a much larger build (6'5 or so at 250 lbs.). I have read all the Jack Reacher books and was quite disappointed Tom was chosen. With that said, He did a fine job. The movie was entertaining.
B000001ESJ|1.0|I doesn't recieve the product and in the order history appear as delivered. That is a big problem for me
140006922X|5.0|Demystified and brought to life this incredible story. Truth is always better than fiction. Allows reader to come to this story from any perspective, Christian or not, believer or not. The writer obviously loves this subject.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book.  It took some getting used to the switching between families but before long I was into the swing of it.  The secret isn't revealed until way into the book and I had begun to think there wasn't one.  There certainly was and it was a doozy.  I thought the ways that this secret affected so many people was very interesting.  Our lives are impacted by many different actions.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app on my Android tablet.  By downloading the versions I wanted and the Kindle books we are using as our lesson material, I can be off-line and jump back and forth with no problems.  Great product!  I've already recommended this product to others and had them download it.  Thanks!
B003E6LC6I|4.0|Each time I watch an episode, I can hardly wait to  to get to the next one..  Wonderful acting.also.  Glenn Close is amazing!
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Really fun and you never want to stop however can be quite hard, I had to cheat online a couple of times
B007CKX8GY|5.0|I've just finished reading ANGELA'S ASHES -- a book I found fortuitously, but also quite fortunately, here in Brooklyn at the 8th Street Book Exchange.<br /><br />\\"Fortuitously\\" is perhaps not altogether accurate.  I pass by this book exchange at least 2-3 times a week in the hope that I'll spot a gem I haven't already read.  I recognized both the title and the author's name immediately -- and grabbed it.  \\"Fortunately,\\" however, is entirely accurate.  Why?  Because I can say with confidence that ANGELA'S ASHES is one of the finest works of literary fiction I know of -- and I've read many in this particular coming-of-age genre, starting decades ago with Henry Fielding's TOM JONES and, just recently, with John Cleland's FANNY HILL.<br /><br />If you've got a fondness for the sound of Irish brogue -- and I do -- ANGELA'S ASHES is the book for you.  The prose in this book moves fast.  VERY fast.  But I suspect that that almost involuntary speed-of-read has more to do with the writer's talent than with the brogue.  It takes talent to make a reader's eye move quickly across the page, and Frank McCourt has that talent.  In SPADES.<br /><br />But he also has something else, which I'll call a perfect pitch and feel for tragicomedy.  There are passages in this book -- great MOUNTAINS of them -- that are painful to read.  There are also passages -- most of them dialogue -- that will make you laugh like Satan.  None of them, mind you, of the knee-slapping variety, but rather of the frenzied-at-midnight, demonically celebratory variety.  I dunno.  Perhaps it's just the brogue.  Or Ireland.  Or the Irish -- surely God's chosen wretches if there ever were such a \\"Chosen People.\\"<br /><br />If I have any criticism of ANGELA'S ASHES -- any at all -- it would be only this:  I wish Frank McCourt would hoe his prose-gardens with more standard punctuation.  It would render his prose-roses less thorny in the plucking.<br /><br />I give this book only five stars because I can't award it any more than that.<br /><br />RRB<br />09/04/13<br />Brooklyn, NY<br />[[ASIN:B004OEKBIE Trompe-l'oeil (or, The In and Out. Of Love.)]]any more than that.<br /><br />RRB<br />09/04/13<br />Brooklyn, NY<br />[[ASIN:B004OEKBIE Trompe-l'oeil (or, The In and Out. Of Love.)]]
B006L9B6TI|4.0|I like the concept. However, God is not a genie and He will not allow you to have what you don't need.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, challenging game where you find clues to get to the next level<br /><br />Each level gets a little more difficult
B0049P1N3K|4.0|I liked it. Found it very interesting to read. Interesting in the whole concept of Gratitude for good and for bad.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this ingeniously constructed novel.  The 6 stories range over centuries from the past to the future.  If you're looking for something different, well written and plotted, you'll like this.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|Ancient concept that has come on through the Centuries and been lived by notably famous people from every corner of the world.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Jane Eyre has always been a favorite book and I was pleased to find a film version of it that came closer to capturing the deep emotional side - not just the dark side - of the story.  Didn't dwell much on the early years, but the story didn't suffer because of it.  I have all the JE videos/series and this is my favorite so far.
B009JZTOG8|3.0|The introduction of new characters starts to get a little confusing and seems to try to substitute for giving some of the original characters more depth. It's starting to play like a soap opera. But we still watch on the edge of our seats and can't wait to see what happens next - so the magic is still there! :)
B007HUD6OS|4.0|A well written story. Good information on the law.  And it had a good ending.  Shows that it pays to get involved.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|The Hobbit felt as though it was the same story we saw in the previous Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Both plots involved a group of strangers coming together to go on a journey back to a mountain to face a terrible creature.  Also, there were elements of this movie that were completely made up only to make it more similar to the original movies.  Average at best.
B0014DQSG2|5.0|I give this movie a 5 star because I think it is a great movie.  It has a terrific story line, good music, fun and a little romantic and I can watch it again and again and each time it is just great!  I think Amanda does an awesome job in this movie!
B007L5KT76|4.0|A Game of Shadows was a fun, entertaining sequel that kept with the feel of the first.  It could have done more though, to highlight the brilliant investigative nature of Holmes rather than just focus on his quirks.
0307474259|5.0|Gary Taubes takews a truly fresh approach to the human endocrine system with regards to gaining or losing fat.  It's like for my entire life I've been told that the tail wags the dog, and Taubes sets the record straight in this book!
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|I'm surprise I never heard much about this movie.  I may not be as good as Matrix or Minority Report; but it was diffidently worth watching.  Full of action and what you expect from a science fiction.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very addictive. fun. entertaining. I probably should get rid of it Bc I play it too often. yet here I am. playing this mind numbing game.
B0091REZMW|4.0|can be played without making purchases... just takes longer. hidden objects that move each time and good support from developers and other players.
1907590099|5.0|Whether you've done it or are considering doing it or will never do it but are still curious, this book is well worth reading! Even apart from its interesting and useful reports about the effects of mescaline on the mind, the author's observations about ordinary consciousness are so insightful--how the brain normally functions as a \\"reducing valve\\", protecting us from what would otherwise be an overwhelming onslaught of information, but thereby also keeping us from deeply experiencing some of life's greatest miracles of wonder and beauty in ordinary things. A great and essential masterpiece!
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I really enjoyed season 1 of Smash.  I had only caught a few episodes when they were originally broadcast, so I've gone back and watched them all.  The story line is much easier to follow now, lol.  The songs are fresh and memorable, the actors are attractive, there is an interesting story - what's not to love?
B0043U7XJO|5.0|great for light fare adventure romance, and a fun play on how Robin Hood came to be. Cate Blanchette makes a memorable Marion - no surprise there and Russel Crowe does this genre really well
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I liked the story line.  Some of the interactions with Natalie Portman were a little on the cheeseball side.  All in all, it was worth the watch.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just what I was looking for!! I can never find my calculator and very seldom need all its capabilities,  this app comes along. Its always available because I always know where my Kindle is and its easy to use. I love it. Thank you!!
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|Such a disappointment. Great actors and special effects, terrible storyline and script. So sad to see the re-boot of this great enterprise being squandered.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I needed one more HDMI cable for my Apple TV and this is it. It works as it is supposed to work. I have appsolutely no problems with it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This is probably my 10th Baldacci novel<br />Great summertime read and fast paced. I will now move on to his next release.<br />I wish I could write like this because it is a winning formula.<br />4 stars for sure.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Dug deep into my imagination and then some..<br />Finally a female writer not scared to go that bit further.<br />Bravo!!!!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This was a movie that we missed because the previews were awful. It looked like it wasn't worth watching and even when it was time to rent it online we had debated over whether it was worth the rental fee... only later to love it enough to make it a must own.<br /><br />This fit in the category of Wally and more than a few animated greats... atypical characters, titles and previews where you mistakenly think what isn't worth the price of admission was really a gem in disguise.
068484267X|5.0|this is one of the best books I have ever read. I never read a book twice but this one I will. It had every emotion in it you'd laugh you'd cry this man is a good writer...
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I have two young girls and I hope they are not in this deep in high school, but it gives me the perspective of the teenager in the situations.
B001AZFO14|5.0|I'm genuinely surprised this movie is not better known.  I watched it for something to do and was genuinely surprised at how entertaining it was.  It left me wondering why I'd never seen or heard of it before.  Do yourself a favor...if you are looking for something to watch just for pure entertainment value...watch this movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I needed an easy weather app for my Kindle Fire HD and this is certainly it. It allows me to watch the radar while providing the forecast for as many cities as I need. Easy to use and figure out.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|A very shallow plot, but something us guys like.  Lots of gore and action.  Cinematography was good.  Dr. McCoy makes a great Dredd.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a Pinterest maniac and have an app for it on every electronic device that I own. This app is easy to use and allows me to move quickly through my own boards as well as re-pin and browse attached links....
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This is a great logic game! A fun and fast game to play but does require some thought.  Love it!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this has worked exactly as I wanted when away from home.  would recommend for anyone needing a portable alarm clock.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts our easy and works through more difficult levels.  Just about the time you think you've mastered it - you get humbled!  This is a very nice diversion from other games and requires you to put you &#34;thinking cap&#34; on.
1449437524|5.0|This is a really nice reproduction of the original brilliant comic and made a great gift for a dog-loving friend.  The book is well-constructed and reasonably priced.
B001N4RORE|5.0|If you have one of those days that you can't get motivated or you are feeling a little low, buy this movie!! I play it when I have to do housework and it makes cleaning fun. The music is light and happy and it will bring a smile to your face. I never get sick of this movie!!
B001K3EXTA|3.0|Just ok for me. I expected more probably. The lead female part didn't convince me of the romance and the relationship development.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Ultra violent, very bloody, gritty, and dark. Now THAT'S the Judge Dredd we all know and love!<br />I liked the creative style of this movie, and the acting fits just perfectly. Karl Urban uses the growl and his chin to great effect, and the sparse writing and minimal direct character interactions work marvels. And at around 1.5 hours, the length of the movie is just right as well.<br />It all works well together. Steady yourself for a blood bath and enjoy, especially if you're a fan of the &#34;Judge Dredd&#34; comics.<br />I was pleasantly surprised.
B008476HBM|5.0|good product that i am still using. will order from them again. why are they requiring us to type a certain amount of words for a review?????!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excited for Season 4! Can't wait to see how life changes at the prison now that they have welcomed in so many new people. They should be planting a huge garden in that yard!
B007HJ9LXE|3.0|I'm an artist and art teacher and love Frida. The movie was okay, but not fantastic.  Lots of nudity which could have been left out. It does give an accurate description of her life.  Poor Friday
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like it, wish the items weren't so little though. It's hard to see on my kindle fire. It's a fun game.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I watched this as I was reading the book and it's good...just not as good as the book.  I wonder what my opinion would be if I hadn't read the book...
B008YKGQR4|3.0|The app is ok, not great.  Could be greatly improved and I would give five stars.  Hangs up frequently and locks up the Kindle.
1416955070|4.0|How have I not reviewed this yet?! What an amazing start to the series! I heart all of the characters, yes, even the bad ones! They're so wonderfully written. Seriously, if you have not read this book yet, pick it up! It has everything! An adventure for the ages, paranormal creatures for all, hot guys with lots of FEELS throughout the entire read, of course a love triangle, and of course, a strong heroine who grows into herself and kicks butt! I am a lover of Cassandra Clare's writing and this one does not disappoint!
B00DG292SK|2.0|I was very excited to read this book.  After reading it, I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />Wow, Pete is a jerk in this book!  I love and respect his career, Who music and the sixties mod generation.  But Pete is so full of himself it's disgusting!  I especially wasn't happy when he discussed the 2002 tour (the one that took place immediately following John Entwistle's death).  He displays no sign of grief, no mention of what a great person Entwistle was, not even any statement of how Pino Palladino came in and saved the tour.  I would have liked at least a sentence on that.  If I were in Pete's shoes I would have been very grateful to Pino.  But instead, Pete goes on for two paragraphs about benefitting financially from the tour because he and Roger received all of John's proceeds!  It makes me sick how full of himself he is and how cruel he sounds.<br /><br />After reading this, I am very close to no longer being a Who fan.  Every time I hear a Who song I am reminded of what Pete said.  I am disappointed in him.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great find. Fun to watch! Harvey Specter is a total cad but you can't help liking the guy. Don't think too hard about the storyline though, just enjoy the ride :)
B002ZG9968|5.0|Have not viewed this copy yet. I will see it this week and will comment if you resend this message.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app! Very customizable with sooooo many options. Great selection of sounds to choose from, and so many other features, far too many to list. I plan to research this developer and see what else they have created! Kudos to the developers!! Thanks for a great free app!
067101756X|5.0|I became much more educated in some of the strange phenomena that has surrounded the subject of aliens and UFO's.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I would like to see a picture of the main character!  However I think it is a good read.  Recommend it for kids and adults.
B001AG52AG|5.0|A great movie for kids and adults. A must see. I loved the character that Sam Elliott plays, I hope they make a sequel.
B002R88G5E|5.0|This book has a great story and an insight into problems in Afghanistan during the Tali ban problems. The story is heart warming and at the same time distressing to know what went on during that time. Loved the book.
B001FB5634|5.0|PRETTY AMAZING FILM, THANKS FOR THE SUPER SHIP! I LOVED THIS MOVIE BUT VERY DEPRESSING AND CLOSE TO END TIMES.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book is a good quick read.. you can not guess what is coming next. A good picture of a strange situation. Not too deep really but keeps you interested. A good holiday read.
B001RMYWG8|4.0|Better than almost every movie that comes out these days but beat the heroes integrity and the corruption of the police force over the viewers head. A little more subtlety would have gone a long way for making the film more immersive and believable.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A wonderful follow to &#34; The Fall Of Giants.&#34; The books are fiction, to be sure, but written with a mix of real events and people skillfully blended, so as to create in you the feeling that, you are witnessing history as it actually happened. The creation of so many characters acting independently in one place and then involved together in another is both realistic and sometimes vexing. It's very helpful that Mr. Follet has included an character list explaining relationships. Highly recommend.
B002RKRGQ2|4.0|It is good, i like it a lot and i think that it is very well written. I would recommend it.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|You get the feeling that the author ran out of steam or time and just had to cap it somewhere.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very addicting game.  I wish there were more levels with tougher puzzles, but overall it is pretty fun.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|my grand daughter and i have a lot of fun on this app.  She loves to draw and show me what she has made/
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love, love the whole series so far. I bought all 3 and excited for Season 4. I love all the character's in it.<br />Had my daughter watch with me and she's now hooked too. We are both excited for the season 4 to begin.<br />Our only wish it it would go on..Excellent series!! Excellent!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Now that I have been enjoying my Kindle Fire for over a year, I'm noticing that Amazon developers don't keep up with updating apps as well as other platforms such as Apple. I sure wish they would. Looks like I will be purchasing the iPad when I upgrade from this KF.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|A little different from the book with are era of music.  The house was beautiful.  Love Leonardo DIcaprio.  Would watch it again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever. I can sit and play for hours. Plus it's great for entertaining the kids for hours on end too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a never-fail crowd pleaser. Even my husband is hooked. I hope season four is even better. They have a lot to do.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I love  ~Your The Reason God Made Oklahoma~ I grew up with that song!  and also love CD by Blake Shelton~<br />Based on A True Story~ I love Blakes voice and choice of music! Blake can sing any song...WOW!!!  To all that love music, Buy both
0783222149|4.0|One should know that a Meryl Streep action film is not going to be your typical action film, since Meryl Streep is not your typical action heroine.  No, Meryl is your `every-woman', and as that every-woman she brings a level of humanism to her role as a suburban mother taken hostage by thugs in a raft.  She manages to sell us on the action while inserting enough drama and honesty into her character development to have us `feeling' for her and her family every step of the way.<br /><br />For what it is, `The River Wild' is a standard and stand-up action flick.  It centers on a family out for a birthday rafting trip to try and salvage what is left of their rocky marriage.  When complications arise in her husband's schedule, Gail decides to leave for the trip with her son.  That is when Wade and Terry come into the picture.  These two shady characters make their shadiness known relatively quickly, despite lathering on the manipulative charm.  Soon, Gail and her son are relatively kidnapped and forced to navigate these killers through a rough patch of waters.<br /><br />The thrills in the film are satisfactory, nothing extreme or truly breathtaking and yet wholly effective.  It certainly feels like a watered-down thriller, but one that has nice performances, especially from Streep, and some nice photography.  Bacon is rather familiar here, and the plot itself feels slightly too farfetched (or maybe it's that it is too simple) but at the end of the day it is a nice way to spend an evening in.
B00198X0W2|4.0|Superstar George Clooney turns in a stellar performance in this \\"brilliant sci-fi movie\\" (New York Daily News) from Academy Award® winners Steven Soderbergh (2000 - Best Director, Traffic) and JamesCameron (1997 - Best Picture, Titanic). Aboard a lonely space station orbiting a mysterious planet, terrified crew members are experiencing a host of strange phenomena, including eerie visitors who seem all too human. And when psychologist Chris Kelvin (Clooney) arrives to investigate, he confronts a power beyond imagining that could hold the key to mankind's deepest dreams...or darkest nightmares.

It is unfortunate this release isn't popular with Amazon reviewers giving it a lowly 3.5 stars.
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|Kind of twisted fate and different. Lots of action and on the edge. Not the best, but enjoyed it ok
B005ZB91KY|4.0|We are saturated with comics-to-movies offerings these days, and I had modest expectations, but this separated itself from the crowd with some fine attention to WWII-era themes, sets, costumes and dialog, plus some quality special effects that subtly supported the story rather than defined it.  Hugo Weaving was credibly creepy too.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Thought it would be funnier, but it was really trite and silly. Why can't they make comedies without being raunchy?
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|What's going on? After the second installment, this series is just falling flat.  Reminds me of the poor horror movies of the 1970s.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|It was like watching a movie inside a movie. It really wasn't a movie they had part running on top and the other on the bottom all I can say was weird..
B00004R99F|5.0|This movie came out when one of my kids was a teen and the other a pre-teen, so all of us could relate to and enjoy the story.  It's a cute movie, on top of being a great conversation-starter for us :)
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Kind of slow.. The plot was trite to me. I like watching movies with Matthew McConaughey don't know if the boys learned any lessons or not..
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Like this interesting twist on an old favorite game. Just started playing but so far so good. Easy to see.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|One of my favorite adversaries is Khan. This was such a good retelling of his story. So smart but devoid of compassion for those that are lesser than he and his.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I loved watching this! Once you start you can't stop! Highly recommend! I am inspired to be a lawyer! Yay!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very cute game my daughter just absolutely loves playing it and taking care of her horse since she wants a real one badly
B005XQLBU4|5.0|truly hard to put down! great retake of an arcade classic from way back when. the upgrades really pull it together
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Its long and slow.  The effects save it somewhat and if you like scifi, you will tolerate it more.  Watch if  you have nothing else to watch.
0545259096|5.0|I can't believe I am finally done with the Wolves of Mercy Falls series :( I remember downloading a sample of Shiver from my kindle and loving it, and now I just finished the last page of Forever. I have definitely grown to care for these characters and the quiet town of Mercy Falls, and leaving it behind is a lot harder than I originally thought it would be.<br /><br />I thought Forever was an amazing novel, and the perfect ending to one of my favorite trilogy. What makes this trilogy so different, is the fact that despite it being about werewolves, it focuses more on human relationships than it does on the supernatural aspect of the wolves. What Sam, Grace, Isabelle, and Cole had to go through at such a young age is really heartbreaking. I love that Maggie decided to write the last two books in four different points of view, and she is so talented that I felt as if each narrator was so well developed and had a distinctive voice.<br /><br />With Sam, his story with his parents really tugged at my heartstrings. I couldn't imagine going through what he went through, and like Grace acknowledges, he really did grow up a lot since the beginning. He was no longer the wallflower watching life pass him by, but a leader with hidden strengths.<br /><br />I loved that Grace and her parents had that heart to heart, and she finally was able to tell them what she felt and gained back control in her life. God, her parents were the most annoying characters ever and I was so glad that she stood her ground.<br /><br />Isabelle and Cole are my absolute favorite characters though. They are so different from Grace and Sam, in a sense that unlike their friends, they seem to act younger than they actually are. Isabelle with her nonchalant attitude, is just a girl that is lost and feels as if no one understands her. Cole, a reckless ex-rockstar, who just wants to find something worth living for. I wish we had more of their story because they both have grown so much, and were fantastic characters. Their chemistry is sizzling, and I love them together and individually.<br /><br />Without spoilers, I want to say that unlike the last books in most series, this one was amazing and did not disappointed. All loose ends were tied perfectly, and the ending was concrete enough to feel complete, but not entirely closed off to where you can't go back to revisit Mercy Falls when it calls to you again
B000P0J0D8|2.0|Cannot comment on the film since the disc was bad and would stutter, skip and just lock up and not play after the first three minutes.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Excellent price for a automatic watch, keeps time accurately. Runs for about 36 hours after removed from wrist. Great buy!
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|When I heard Tarantino was going to pay homage to the Sergio Leone Westerns I got pretty excited, and while this movie was entertaining, it was a far cry from the plot and cinematography of the originals.  I know Tarantino likes to put his own spin and style on things, but it got pretty far fetched for me and killing off all of the best characters seems a little cliche these days.  It's worth watching but not remembering.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|The acting, awesome; storyline, intense and captivating.  A friend of mine was watching this from the beginning and I start watching until the 3rd series was about to start.  I watched Season 1, Prequel and Season 2 in a week (while home sick).  Instantly hooked.<br /><br />This season took all those season up another notch.  I won't give any spoilers away, but if you know anything about history, you know how this ends.  For any series I have ever watched, I couldn't have been happier with the way they tied everything up and ended it.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This is definitely worth a watch for anyone that appreciates rock n roll from the past 35 years. I will probably end up watching this again. With your prime Account, it's free :-)
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I love amazon over itunes because amazon doesn't require you to download the movie before you watch it, I can stream it whenever I want to watch it. Great Movie, great service.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Well, I loved playing this game, until it came to trying to purchase a coin pack so that I could have fun and keep playing!<br /><br />I purchased a $9.99 coin pack, and 5 days later had still not received the coins in my total.  Over the course of the 5 days, I had contacted their online tech support twice, only to receive no response at all.  They certainly were quick to take my money though!<br /><br />Eventually, I called Amazon, and they told me to try it again.  So I did... and still no coins showing up in my account.  Amazon, as usual, were fantastic, and issued me 2 lots of $9.99 credit refunds.  They told me to contact the App Tech Support again, but I ended up just deleting this entire game off my Kindle.  Buyer Beware!!
B00BSBX9TE|5.0|I was transported to that privilege place where seeing and feeling everything happening was possible. I had to force myself to stop reading to get some sleep.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Rough, violent, and unforgiving.... yet, there is something more to the judge than meets the eye.  I wasn't sure how I'd like Karl Urban as the judge, but thought he pulled it off with panache. At times a bit gratuitous, but then, this is the Judge we are talking about.  All in all really enjoyed the film.
0802407692|5.0|My husband and I are on our second deployment and have had our fair share of rocky moments in our marriage. I read through this book in less than 3 hours! I had read the previous 5 love languages book and this one is has the same concept but so much more information regarding military couples. After reading this I felt hope in my marriage and thankfulness knowing that we are not the only military couple that have empty love tanks! I just purchased a second copy to keep and I am sending my original copy to my deployed husband. :)
B003G4W49C|4.0|Really liked the book and would def recommend it to anyone who has an interest in politics and military warfare.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This is a great series. I hope we get a nice design with this Bluray Box Set. It sucks that this item was $175 day 1 and now it costs a little bit more. I'm going to wait for another drop, since the only season I don't own is the current one.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|....but this one seemed to have a lot less action than the first.  I'm hoping the next two in the series are more similar to the first book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Favorite book by far! John Green is an excellent writer!:) Ordering another one of hi  books asap! Absolutely brilliant and loving the characters!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Great book with lots of twists and turns and makes you not want to put it down!  Must read for everyone!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I think the expectations for this movie were a bit high from most people, which led to some poor reviews.  It's not a great movie, but it is solidly entertaining if you want to be distracted for a couple of hours.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book with lots of twists and turns and makes you not want to put it down!  Must read for everyone!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Kept my attn the entire time! Didn't see some of it coming but happy with the plot. Ordered book 3 immediately.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great book with lots of twists and turns and makes you not want to put it down!  Must read for everyone!  Cassandra Clare is wonderful!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book came highly recommended and when I started reading it was hard to put down until about midway through ...then It was easy.The storyline is interesting & relatively well written but then the sex goes on & on & on then becomes monotonous. I had to start skimming ahead to see if the story ever develops. I am about 3/4 through & may or may not finish it. I certainly won't get more of the series
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved it. I'm sorry that this is the last Sookie Stackhouse novel.<br />It would be cool to see what happens between her & Sam. In my mind they get married & have twins. One would be a shifter like dad & the other part fae like mommy.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is very easy to play. You get your normal character selection<br />And you choose your style of fighting. The graphics are amazing an  the game  itself is extremely straight forward yet still fun.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great continuation of the storyline. Very well written. Keeps your interest!! I've told lots of my friends about it. Hope they read all 3 books.
B009QU9X44|5.0|I love her style of writing which transports you into the book. So sad to get to the end....I will definitely recommend it to my friends!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like booty  quest because it is really fun and its free. I also like booty quest because you can interact with other people who play booty quest. The only thing i don't like about t it is the timed lives.
B002RI9TB4|4.0|Chimamanda's fluid style of writing keeps you glued to the booked. Love it, love it, love it lots. Great writing style.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I am a very unhappy customer at the time, Amazon. Every Kindle got 0.4.1 update but mine. What the app looks like know is even on the app store! I can't even join my sister's game. Until you fix this, I will stay unhappy.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|an original story line that was thought provoking and funny! loved the character development and how the story was so pertinent to our lives, even today
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|its amazing Lana is just amazing shes beautiful and she has this amazing voice thats so mezmerising. Shes just so amazing.
0385474547|5.0|This story helps put your own life in perspective. It's easy to compare your life to others with similar stories, but here, you can compare your life to someone who lives a completely different reality.
B0091WMSNU|4.0|Very intense, so supensful,,,, just an awesome movie jack nicolson is lights out in this movie,, everyone had an intense role in this powerful movie.
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|Fun story,good acting and a great movie if you are a fan of the video game or books. A big step up from other halo movies.
B008MWBY6W|1.0|Too small for a dslr camera, I struggled to put my camera and lens. Forget about cables and other stuff.
B005544V6A|5.0|Really enjoyed the first season and have started the second season. I would recommend Suits, it's great. Love Harvey and mike!
B003B02PEU|5.0|Typical John Grisham, well written. I didn't want to put it down. I loved the unexpected twist at the end. Like a sucker punch, you don't see it coming.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Really funny about time there is a movie related to getting older so raw and funny I recommend this toeveryone
B0032FPVKE|3.0|Product construction, materials and finish are more than you would expect.  Unfortunately sizing is off (small) and its not for large (46x zoom) and up P&S cameras.  My Finepix SL1000 has to be squeezed and pushed down hard to get the zipper closed.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I am a new Brandi Carlile fan!  I fell in love with The Story when it was featured on Grays Anatomy, listened to it over and over.  When I saw Brandi on Austin City Limits, I found out who and where the song came from.  I just had to get her cd.  Not a mistake.  Will look for and buy more Brandi Carlile soon.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|\\"Mud\\" what a movie bringing up so many issues we all face daily, crushes, love, jealousy, narcissistic personalities or what we psychologist use to call sociopaths.  We even saw a psychopath, who was the brother of the murdered man by Mud played by the star of the movie Matthew McConaughey, who I first saw in the movie  \\"A Time To Kill\\" and what a movie that was of the true south.  Guess what the South has not changed spent 6 months down in Georgia and there still is a Clan or KKK, as well as Bigots all over, who are willing to say the most unspeakable things about black people, when they are standing right there in a store talking to me.<br /><br />Let's not forget the police in the South, oh how they truly hate us Northerners, those that were born and breed there.  You would think we started our Civil War here in the states where .  The controlling rich man, who is not afraid to use others to take the Law into his own hands.  King was played by \\"Walking Tall\\" star Joe Don Baker.<br /><br />What a performance by Sam Shepard who played Tom Blankenship the neighbor, who lives across the river on another houseboat, who helped raise Mud when he found him in the swaps of the Bayou country.<br /><br />Last but not least the Real Stars were Tye Sheridan who played Ellis and his best friend Jacob Lofland who played Neckbone, these two young men have a future in the movie business and I do hope they continue, as they will go far with their craft of acting.  You felt like you knew them, as I had friends, where I lived in Charlotte, New York like them growing up through thick and thin we were together at that age.  Playing baseball, telling stories, getting into trouble and getting caught by our parents or a neighbor.  Those were the good days when we were just starting to realize we were growing into adults like our parents, and that was scary for 12 and 15 year olds.  We wanted to love, but did not know much about it in those days, but we learned once in high school and there was a lot more to love than the sex, there was the emotions and feelings we all kept hidden and only told our best friends.  Two in our group of chums are gone one saved his troop in Viet Nam and the other got involved in drugs and passed, his choice with the alcohol to get him started.  Just like Ellis and Neckbone we all believed in Love, but really did not understand it, much like they did not.  It was a word you only said to the right person who came along in your life.  That is what Mud had with Juniper his childhood sweetheart played by Reese Witherspoon, who I almost did not recognize her, she has changed, but even as a child she could act and she did a wonderful amount of acting in this story of the childhood love that really never dies for Mud and Juniper.  They are connected throughout their lives.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie with a great cast of actors and the writing of Jeff Nichols tells us a story we all have been through in our childhood, with friends and parents, who confused most of us children.<br /><br />Cast (in credits order)Matthew McConaughey ... Mud, Reese Witherspoon ... Juniper, Tye Sheridan ... Ellis, Jacob Lofland ... Neckbone, Sam Shepard ... Tom Blankenship, Ray McKinnon ... Senior and Sarah Paulson ... Mary Lee, were Ellis parents, Michael Shannon ... Galen, brother of the man Mud killed to save Juniper from dying, Joe Don Baker ... King,<br />Paul Sparks ... Carver, Bonnie Sturdivant ... May Pearl, who Ellis thinks is his girlfriend and Stuart Greer ... Miller.<br /><br />Below is the link to a Great movie to bring back childhood memories for one and all of us called \\"MUD\\" for a Friday or Saturday night and enjoy those memories my friends:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00ECUARO8 B00ECUARO8]]

1594204217|5.0|Although Michael Pollan tends to have a formulaic approach to writing a book, the results, in his case, are marvelous and poetic. When he tells me what he will be telling me, and how he will explain it, I think it might be like a magazine article in Good  Housekeeping ( &#34;Six Great Desserts With Zero Calories!&#34;). What it turns out to be is quirky, fun, deeply thought through, and well- written.
1400052181|5.0|This book was wonderful!  I enjoyed every minute of it, and simply devoured it as soon as I received it.  It's a great mix of science explained in a way that any reader would understand, history, and a loving family story.  I would definitely recommend it.  It was so interesting to see how Skloot developed a relationship with the Lacks family and how it influenced her writing of this book.  You will not be sorry that you made this purchase.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Definitely would recommend this seller and if your a fan of HIMYM!!!!!!! The price was like 7 bucks so it wasn't that bad and it was in its original packaging which is a plus+

B008JFUN50|4.0|I had the same feeling of general letdown that most of you had, and I didn't even see District 9 to get pumped up about it!  But, the relentless marketing of Elysium prepared me for something grander and more interesting than what I got.  The cover of Entertainment Weekly, for example, way back in May, that read \\"Neill Blonkamp Saves the Summer Blockbuster.\\"<br /><br />If not for that letdown, I'd give this show an A +.  Any movie that puts Jodie Foster in it--here at her most scary and all too human a role, a capitalist driven to shady measures--rather like the part she played in the Spike Lee movie about the heist--any movie with Jodie in it automatically gets a pass from me because she is a genius actor!  Matt Damon is not so lucky, and I don't mean even to hint at the spoilers, but I just mean his role is sort of undeveloped and just like the working class of the world he rarely gets to speak his mind or change expression.  However maybe I'm wrong, because Diego Luna as Julio, Max's best friend, is very expressive, almost languid like Oscar Wilde, and lacks the bruises and welts the makeup artists have painted all over Matt's body.  He seems to have wandered in from another movie, perhaps one that Merchant and Ivory were about to make when they died.<br /><br />The movie seems to pivot on the great coincidence of Matt wandering into the only emergency ward in which his childhood sweetheart happens to be working and happens to be on staff.  What?  Well, they were careful to make the point that few medical services exist to help out the poor, but still!  Earth is supposed to be so severely overpopulated there aren't enough resources for anybody.  If I was Alice Braga, I'd change my agent!  Alice, you're great in this as Fray the nurse with the cute little girl Matilda, but you were also great playing the exact same role in I Am Legend years ago, and maybe these post apocalyptic spectacles are killing the thing that made you Alice Braga.  You don't want your audience to remember you in these parts, but that's what they're going to do, in 2054, when they're old men but still remembering when they were fifteen and saw their first Brazilian woman on screen.ce to remember you in these parts, but that's what they're going to do, in 2054, when they're old men but still remembering when they were fifteen and saw their first Brazilian woman on screen.

0880796863|5.0|I got these Tarot cards to help me make informed life choices. I usually consult the cards before I do anything of importance; for example I used them last night to discern if I should go to Wendy's or McDonald's last night.The spirits gave me a pretty definitive answer through the cards. These cards are cheap, nice to look at, and excellent at conjuring spirits of prophecy. I'm going to start free readings out of my house next week for the low price of $5 each.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|almost as good as playing at Friday Night Magic! only problem is all cards are legal. really wish they would have standard only campaigns.
B00E25KVLW|4.0|I'm about 1/3 of the way through the book so far, taking it slow as I get time to spend on it.  I'm a PHP developer so I have programming experience already.  I'm not sure how an absolute beginner would react to the book, but I think it's well written and easy to follow.  Very instructive.  I've gone through another Ruby book that jumped straight into Rails, but I like that this one takes you through the basics of Ruby first and then goes into it.  Examples are clear and easy to go through.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|Quo Vadis means &#34;Where goest thou?&#34; The film has a message for us today.  Where are we going? The martyrs in this story were willing to die for what they believed in. The film reflects our Judeo-Christian heritage in historical terms. Undoubtedly, some may find the theme dated, old fashioned, or not politically correct by modern standards. Nevertheless, I was moved by characters who were willing to die for a cause greater than themselves. Marcus, Robert Taylor's character, started out as a self-centered hedonist filled with lust for the beautiful Lygia. She, however, demands a higher standard of love from him and will not compromise her faith or her ideals. All of these elements in the story underlie the theme of good against evil symbolized by the saintly character of Peter on the one hand and the degenerate Nero on the other. Such a film is ageless. It will continue to inspire us long after the cheap thrills of contemporary films are forgotten. Both Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr touched the hearts of viewers years ago when the film first appeared, and they maintain their appeal to this day. The visual grandeur of the film is breathtaking and holds its own against such classics as Gone With the Wind, but the quality of the story and the moral fabric of the tale make it worth purchasing for its own sake.  The peerless beauty and touching performance of Deborah Kerr are worth the price of the film. Buy it. You won't regret it. Finally, it is also great entertainment.
0312430000|5.0|Excellent read, especially for anyone in a task driven career- I am nurse and it was spot on and helped me really organize how I deliver my care.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Better than I expected. They captured the feel of the book but modernized it. Good acting and soundtrack. Thank goodness they didn't go with a 1920s soundtrack.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have been enjoying playing this game. It is a fun challenge.  I downloaded this game based on previous reviews.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|As others have said the cinematography is outstanding. Be sure to watch the extras on the DVD/Blu Ray for the authors inspirations for making this movie so visually stunning. Unfortunately the plot is a little thin and there are hints dropped throughout the movie that makes you question what's really going on. By the time we see Morgan Freeman you should have figured out who the scav's really are before there actually revealed. There's a sprinkling of many other sci fi themes in this movie, but I've never seen any movie without their flaws and plot holes. Sometimes you can ignore them, sometime you can't. As stated earlier the real star of this movie are the visuals and special effects. You won't get the complete story until the last 15 minutes of the film so watch it to the end.<br /><br />There's going to be an Oblivion 2 that will take place before our civilization was destroyed that will offer more answers. From what I've read it going to be a prequel.
B005FFW46S|4.0|Another great story of Disc World. Commander Vimes takes a holiday but can't leave being a copper at home. I had a hard time putting it down, the plot twists could only be imagined in Disc World.
B00DJZI2N0|5.0|If you've seen the movie \\"Enough\\", with Jennifer Lopez, you'll find similarities between that movie and this book and the female protagonist within each. But that's where any similarities end.<br /><br />This story is gripping and mind-blowing at the same time, and written oh so incredibly well. It's also creatively handled. Catherine is a woman who suffers severe OCD, an affliction, we discover, that she didn't have until she met a charming, handsome man years ago. Though the relationship starts out as a fairytale, it soon becomes one filled with psychological and physical horror, leading Catherine down what seems to be an unrecoverable path of obsessions and compulsions. What unfolds from there is disturbing but fascinating, particularly as the book weaves two timetables together -- one from Catherine's past with this mysterious, dangerous man, and one from Catherine's present with a new mystery man who is intent on uncovering the real woman beneath the fractured soul. Ultimately, the two timelines and stories meld, then flip, giving the reader a heart-stopping climax and an oh-so-satisfying end.<br /><br />A must read. That you'll want to read again and again.
B005544TRQ|5.0|What an inspirational show!  I have found few shows this captivating from the beginning, it is smart, funny and leaves my wife and I wanting more each episode.
B005USZML4|3.0|It was a good book and it kept my interest but I prefer the John Grisham mysteries more.  Am waiting for his new publication that will be out in the next few months. There are more legal issues in the Grisham mysteries but this was a good read .
0399536108|5.0|Despite the fact that this book makes me hate myself for not being more awesome, It gives me hope that I too can be awesome one day.  This is a self-help-esc book that really grabbed me and demanded to be read, I like to read, but that doesn't happen much for me.<br /><br />I think the back says it best &#34;If you have ever wondered, 'is there more to life than this', this is the book for you&#34;.  A purchase that will inspire you to be better and to do more with your life.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I know my daughter is going to love it but I have to wait until Christmas before she'll get it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A very slick well written show, I think it ranks right up there with The Good Wife as a law firm/legal procedures/personal drama series.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The effects of the movie are good, the plot is original, the acting was OK.  It was a nice movie to watch, but there was just something missing to me.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I started this book this morning at the gym and finished it after supper!  It was THAT good!! Such a moving, wonderful story!! I definitely ugly cried during it!! Can't wait to read the next book!!
B00COO2D6O|4.0|good game. I like the 1st one better graphic wise. I recommend this game for anyone who loves tower defence games.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Old USAF WX OBS. One of the better apps out there. Four out of five stars. .may rate higher after some extended use.
B00DP8XSQ2|5.0|This is a very entertaining and educational app. You should check this out. You do not even have to be outside, app takes your location and correlates the stars location in relation to where you are.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|LOVE THIS APP!!! I  play it every day! I bought it twice!<br />It's just FUN to play!!!! I recommend it to everyone!!! Love it!!!!
1582701709|5.0|Rhonda Byrne writes this book in a very easy to follow and comprehend manner.  In this regard, the lessons offered in this book are readily understood.  I have purchased this book three times now after giving my other two copies away.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who is new to the Law of Attraction.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series and can't get enough of Gideon and Eva.  Sooo much better than 50 Shades.  You will not be sorry you read this series.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|I purchased this movie for my son and the entire family loved it.  This is definitely a classic and the message is very important.
B008GM1G70|5.0|I feel awake, and I feel like my life just got a whole lot more interesting. I feel like I should have been taking notes, now that I've finished watching this movie. 'Waking Life' is so rich and full of ideas. I'm so glad that I chose to watch this, and I can't wait to watch it again - next time with someone else, as opposed to alone like I have done just now. Please, if you have the chance, watch this movie. I doubt you would regret it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Why fix a good thing?  Why change the format?  Why make this app from reliable to glitchy?  DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!  Uninstall if you did...I have.  Too bad I can't give negative stars.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|This was a fast read, just not that great.  Like LeCarre but not as good.  Spying and mystery related themes.
B00288KNL8|5.0|I love anything Neil Gaiman and Tim Burton... this movie is so fun it made me wish I was a kid again so I could sort of get scared by it.  It's just got that magical feeling that makes you forget you're watching a flick, and you sort of forget about things like bills, or social conflicts, and kind of just get to be a kid again for an hour or so.  Just absolutely fantastic, and I'm a really hard guy to please when it comes to movies.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It was a great read! A friend of mine suggested it & I'm so glad she did. It's probably one of my top 10 books. Total page turner and major twist at the end!
B000BT97AO|2.0|Really disappointed in this one.  I love the author's work as well as the director's, but man... what a flop... don't even waste your time if you loved movies like Labyrinth.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Awesome app that helps me stay closer to my musical passion both at home and on the go. Definitely worth downloading
B001IXSU8M|5.0|My God... I don't know why I like this album, but I absolutely can't get enough.  What's wrong with me?  I'm usually into 90's rap, or anything non-metal 80's... This B-Word just took over pop with her first two albums, and I feel ashamed, as a grown man, to keep listening to it repeatedly.  This album will steal your manhood and make you feel like a 15-year-old girl in the 80's when Madonna was raping our ears with hits.  Defend your manhood gentlemen... don't even tempt yourself with this one.  It's too good.  It's so good... i didn't turn it down in my car when a couple of g's rolled up next to me at the stoplight and glanced my way...
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Really it is most very very fun and good to play.  I find it very very fun! Truly very fun!
B003RNXIBK|4.0|Much better than his previous two albums.  You'll feel like you did when you first heard Eminem after his silly first album.  Just about every track is a head nodder.
0596522347|5.0|Nancy has tremendous insight into the creation and delivery of presentations. This has become my go-to book for my planning and presentation creative process. I am a much better presenter as a result of this book.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Even better than the first! It has in game purchases, but they totally aren't needed. Hours of fun. Difficulty gets crazy hard before too long.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best works of science fiction I have ever read--and a good novel by any standard.  I highly recommend it.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|This story was truly gritty and dirty from start to finish. I felt so many things for the character; from remorse to fear and then back to remorse. The author surely got into the filthy and dark mindset of the killer and he explained it to us well. A curl up in bed on a spooky night type of tale. Great job!
B00008DDSC|5.0|Fantastic movie. Incredibly courageous roles. Depicting a neurotic slice of life that most people are unaware of--self-harm and sadism in a very sensitive way with great performances by the main characters. The resolution is beautiful. Those that suffer from such neurosis or those who know they are neurotic will take comfort in seeing that others are as weird or weirder than them.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The idea behind this book was catchy, but the characters did not seem fully developed. Flowers have been used forever as a way to communicate, and the use of them as indicators of emotions was Victorian as well as modern. I felt the ending was rushed, characters were left hanging and threads of themes were left untied.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome ideas to share !!  I check everyday to see what's new to see and do.  Pinterest is awesome !
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed this season right up until the final moment of the final show...  then my heart broke.  Now waiting for season 3 is gut wrenching!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|awesome show with a  fantastic cast and everything about the purchase was great, I highly suggest anyone who is a fan
B00B1D7ANK|4.0|I gave this to my girlfriend's son after we went to Medieval Times for dinner & entertainment.  Seeing the knights got him excited about a toy.  I thought this would be perfect.  Here are some of his thoughts & my thoughts on this toy.<br /><br />Pros -<br /><br />Great sculpt with lots of details (even on the underside muscles of the dragon).<br /><br />Amazing paint job.  Each little painted item has pristine lines, no sloppy edges.  There are literally at least a dozen or more colors on this toy - each were perfectly applied.<br /><br />The wings are poseable.  These ball joints can come out, but easily go back in without issue.  The wings lock easily to keep the position.<br /><br />The rider has a practical stance that looks good for standing or sitting - which is often difficult to pull off.  This to me is a cool feature.<br /><br />The rider / dragon has a magnet to hold the figure tight to the saddle.  This to me is a great idea and should've been used on more toys back in the day.<br /><br />Cons -<br /><br />Limited poseability on the dragon & none on the rider.  The dragon has wing movement only.  I wish their was a little more movement on both of the pieces, but also realize that's not Schleich's style.<br /><br />Only the single magnet.  The feature was so cool, yet it could've been put to a greater use.  The magnets could've been used to hold the armor on the dragon (making it look like a normal dragon with the removal).  Or, the rider / knight could've had a magnet to hold on his shield, spear or both.  Magnets seem like something that should be overstated in the design, if poseability is not there.<br /><br />Conclusion -<br /><br />Overall this is not just a kids toy.  This looks like a detailed model.  A child may miss the joint movement, but they will be impressed by cool factor.  Parents who have dealt with normal toys (always easily breaking, made cheaply out of light plastic), they will be impressed by the weight & quality of an item that could easily last throughout a childhood.easily last throughout a childhood.
B00B769XB8|4.0|This was very good, a upbeat of the last movie, hope to see a another adventure to close the action of this one.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Spoiler alert:<br />I definitely enjoyed this book far more than A Thousand Splendid Suns, but I am not a big fan of jumping around in a time sequence, so I found that bit a bit challenging, but he did tie it all together well. Except for the chapter focusing on the son of the criminal- I would have liked him to come back into the story at some point. But I thoroughly enjoyed the book and have no hesitation about recommending it to others.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is one of the best I ever played I recommended this game to so many people at school
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Grandson and his friends like it.  Did not hold their attention for a long span of time, but they're six so nothing does.
B0036G1T78|5.0|Great example of a classic spy movie that holds up over time.  Great story that stands on its own without needing to be propped up by millions of dollars of special effects.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Grandson really likes this one and I like the fact it makes him think and try to figure out the moves to make it perfect.
B001I9B9I4|5.0|Excellent movie; I really like the story, the actors, everything about it.  This is the type of movie you watch again and again!
B00D8HNR5W|4.0|Things must be going pretty swell in the Trent Reznor household. The man seems to have found some sort of domestic bliss, down to having his wife collaborate on the How To Destroy Angels project. He now has Grammy and Oscar trophies for the mantlepiece. He's so happy that, a few years after he declared Nine Inch Nails over, he's resurrected the name and put out the almost chipper \\"Hesitation Marks.\\" While hardly a classic NIN album, it doesn't deserve the angry fanboy one/two star reviews. Let's address why \\"Hesitation Marks\\" is a good NIN album.<br /><br />Reznor stopped using his studio time for anger management years ago, probably starting at \\"With Teeth.\\" Saying that the guy's not pissed off anymore is obvious to anyone with an attention span of more than one album. He's been making music as craftsmanship as he sees fit for a long time now. Hence the politics of rocking \\"In Teeth,\\" the concept album and viral campaign for \\"Year Zero,\\" the ambient soundtrack precursor of \\"Ghosts\\" and his \\"thank you\\" to his fans, the so-so \\"The Slip,\\" then gave it away as a download freebie. Angry young men don't sit down with movie rough cuts and devise soundtracks/scores. \\"Hesitation Marks\\" reflects all of these aspects. In fact, it's more like revisionism of his earlier work. \\"Hesitation Marks\\" sounds an awful lot like a grown man's look back at \\"Pretty Hate Machine.\\"<br /><br />\\"Copy Of A\\" takes this notion head on. Complete with a guest guitar run from Lindsey Buckingham (yes, the guy from 70's megastars Fleetwood Mac for you newbies), Reznor digs right in:<br /><br />\\"I am just a copy of a copy of a copy<br />Everything I say has come before<br />Assembled into something into something into something<br />I am never certain anymore.\\"<br /><br />He's in on the whole idea. That's why when the haunting \\"All Time Low\\" brings to mind images from \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" Reznor is looking at the paranoia from a man who's already been to the bottom and can now see what abyss looks like from a safe distance. The atmospheric guitar from one time King Crimson/Bears/Bowie guitarist Adrian Belew makes me wish Belew could have found his place comfortably in the NIN framework, as he's always been an asset to any band who needs their guitars coming in from left field. Belew's appearance here, along with Buckingham's (or for that matter, super-bassist Pino Palladino) is clear evidence that Reznor is looking after the perfection he desires in these songs.<br /><br />I can't say that \\"Hesitation Marks\\" is all peaches and debris, as the song's tendency to be reminiscent of earlier, classic work can be distracting. That doesn't mean the album is bad, nor does it qualify the album as not enjoyable. Trent Reznor has every right to be happy. It also gives him the leeway to say (as he does in \\"Everything\\"), \\"I have tried everything, and I've survived everything.\\" Good on him, and lucky for us. \\"Hesitation Marks\\" quietly rages on, doing so in a manner befitting a man pushing 50.ke from a safe distance.

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|i was really disappointed in this book. There were multiple themes that were never really tied together until the end. Would wait for paper book.
B004WESFZW|5.0|This is a great movie. The combo pack of Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy gives you a number of options
1400069742|5.0|I know how it ends, of course, but still a page turner. Roosevelt's electoral strength and political pusillanimity; Lindbergh's short-sightedness--and apparent anti-Semitism; the anti-Semitism and disloyalty of the military upper echelon; the intrigue and deception; the wailing Mothers; the hard-learned integrity of Wendell Willkie; the anger and vitriol; and Woody Guthrie, Dr. Seuss, and Kurt Vonnegut!<br /><br />It all could have gone horribly wrong. It went just right enough.<br /><br />The quote attributed to Churchill, whether apocryphal or not, captures it: \\"We can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, after they have exhausted all the other possibilities.\\"
B00005ASOC|4.0|Loved the underplayed role for Sean Connery.  Liked it so much I am giving it to family members for Christmas.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Always changing, never ordinary, calming and then hectic, in your face and moving your spirit, never settling for ordinary or safe.  Queens of the Stone Age are the new &#34;the only band that matters&#34;!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I literally couldn't put it down.  It has all the elements of a keeper. Hope for more like this one.
1616550414|5.0|An encyclopedia for Zelda nerds.  Beautiful looking book, that makes for great coffee table reading.  My kids love looking at all the full color artwork, and I like going through the timelines and backstories of the land of Hyrule (and Skyloft, Termina, and whatever else).
B001GJ3BR8|5.0|This movie is great. The theatrical was crap. Compared to the other Marvel movies, this one fell right behind Iron Man for me.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|If you're looking for a game like Mario bros this is the game for you it works great on my kindle and it has awesome graphics. It is also really fun to play and addicting so I would say is better than Mario bros. I recommend this game to everyone.
B0000062FN|5.0|Pros: Gorgeous cover art, fantastic music, outstanding musicians, cultural explosion<br />Cons: none<br />Comment: It's hard to live up to Abraxas, but it's stinkin close.
B003NX75B8|5.0|I read this book for a new book club I joined and really liked it. While it's a young adult book it has a great message about tolerance which I appreciated. Great for high school students.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Was told by friends not worth watching loved saw it twice only regret missed it in I max : (
B006PTZNSY|4.0|I had no expectations when I ordered this cd. Starships was the only song my the artist I had heard. For the most part I enjoy the cd, but only the second half. (Songs 10-18) The rest of the cd is a little too off the wall for my tastes, but all in all a good buy.
B00DU74U74|3.0|first impression, didn't care for it; pacing felt slow and I fast forwarded.  The main character, the one taken over, was unknown to the audience before capture, and so wasn't established as an individual but as a prisoner in her own body who we hear in voice over.  Didn't care for the voice over but as I'm feeling especially unwell that likely affected appreciation of the story so will view again and further amend.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I borrowed the first book from my sister, since there was such a \\"buzz\\" about the trilogy. I figured I'd give it a shot and be open minded about the book. What's the worst thing that could happen?<br /><br />Well, the worst DID happen! I've been a reader since I was little and can plow through a book this size in 2 or 3 days easily. However, it took me 8 days to get to the end of this so-called romance. If romance means \\"biting my lips, calling the guy mercurial and constantly referring to my 'inner goddes'\\", then yeah, this is a romance. Apparently I have a totally different meaning for the term romance than the writer of this trilogy. \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a romance. \\"Gone Withe the Wind\\" is a romance. This is nothing more than horrible Twilight fan fiction, replacing Edward with Christian Grey and Bella with Anastasia. I haven't had to force myself to read and finish a book since I got out of high school.<br /><br />Seriously, don't bother wasting your time with this crap on paper. One would make better use of one's cash by donating the cost of the books to charity.
B005MMYCY6|1.0|When an antisocial psycho bully (Hescher, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) meets a monosyllabic personality-challenged child (T.J. Forney, played by Devin Brochu) and a near-catatonic father (Rainn Wilson as Paul Forney) who lost his wife in a car wreck, together they form an obnoxiously dysfunctional &#34;family&#34; when Hescher moves in uninvited. Although this alone could have been amusing, it's not. Positives in the film are a sweet enabling grandmother, played by the great Piper Laurie as Madeleine Forney, and academy award winner Natalie Portman in a miscast role as a wimpy why-me grocery clerk and &#34;friend&#34;. I recommend against seeing this film unless you enjoy watching bullies rule over the meek and weak. Famous acting talents didn't help this feel-bad vehicle.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was really good but I just wish it was longer I finished this book in one night!! I'm 10 years old and in 4 th grade. This is probably a 3rd grade level book.
B00448SE4S|4.0|Scott Pilgrim is a really fun movie, so if you're looking for an entertaining film on a boring evening at home, here it is! Michael Cera plays the part of Scott Pilgrim, a Canadian bass player in the band Sex Bob-omb. Star-dazzled groupie Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) kinda forces herself on Scott, and they start dating, much to the initial displeasure of the band members. Scott begins to dream about a mysterious, sexy American girl who turns up in real life: Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Her beauty consumes Scott and he drops Knives to pursue Ramona. At a Battle of the Bands Scott is suddenly attacked by singer Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha), who can shoot fireballs out of his hands and can levitate--he's the first of Ramona's Seven Ex-es whom Scott must defeat. The rest of the movie introduces other increasingly magical opponents intent upon stopping Scott from dating Ramona. Can lanky, clumsy Scott continue to persevere against all odds? Will he win Ramona's heart completely? It's fun to watch this zany fantasy to find out!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It is a good book saw about of repeating words and phrases but I like it kept me interested in the book
B00BESM14U|5.0|Charlie (Logan Lerman), a high school freshman, is befriended by Senior student cut-up Patrick (Ezra Miller)--a guy who &#34;puts the ass in class&#34;, according to his lovely Senior step-sister Sam (Emma Watson). At Charlie's first party Patrick introduces him to two pretty Seniors, saying he expects Charlie to receive &#34;nice, meaningful heart-felt blowjobs from both of you&#34;.  They instead feed Charlie &#34;special&#34; brownies, and sit around laughing as Charlie waxes poetic on the subject of high school, who finishes with the observation, &#34;I just really want a milk shake.&#34; At the end of the party the Seniors present a touching toast to fellow-wallflower Charlie, saying &#34;We didn't think there was anyone cool left to meet.&#34; Sam looks into Charlie's eyes and purrs, &#34;Welcome to the island of misfit toys.&#34;<br /><br />I'd love to know how you feel when Sam tells Charlie at Christmas, &#34;I just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you truly loves you.&#34; And Charlie gets his first kiss. Magic. On the other hand Mary Elizabeth, an Overly Attached [self-appointed] Girl Friend introduces Charlie to second base, but their breakup alienates Charlie from the group until Patrick gets beaten by some high school jocks. Charlie blacks out, and comes-to standing over the prone Senior bullies! He saves Patrick, and they are all friends again. True friends. The poignant, soul-touching love they emanate makes the heart sometimes soar, sometimes break; but one always leaves each scene appreciating it's moral compass. Emma Watson is so good I actually fell in love with her character. This movie is a classic for all time.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Dear Fox and J J . . . are you on drugs?? Not since the likes of Star Trek, Dr. Who and Stargate have we seen a concept with this much epic saga potential and spin off possibility the options are freaking endless. This has GOT to be the all time post millenium best sci fi concept for theoretical science, mathematics and tech engineering ever made. They have totally raised the bar here so why stop at season 5. Let me tell you people the only and i mean only thing i didnt like about this series is that it ended
B0032KNA4I|3.0|Temper your expectations on the storyline and plot. Then it is more than watchable. Easy eacape to the easy-listening, vanilla, hollywoodsphere...no worse than the Avengers...
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Definitely a must-see. No matter what anyone says of Tom Cruise he is still an amazing actor, one of the best.
0817439390|5.0|One of the best books on photography out there.  Full of ideas and very well written by Bryan Peterson.  I will be reading more of his books.  Highly recommended.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I jumped three times during this movie--majorly. I really liked that this movie isn't one of those movies that forever doesn't show the monster/demon/etc, in an attempt to create suspense through mystery and anticipation--I hate that! This movie was nicely made and I'm glad I saw it. The little girls were great actresses!!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|SOA is the best it is so addicting to watch once I started I couldnt stop I am glad I can watch all at once
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Like the whole premise of the movie. Cruse was excellent but Freemen's character needed more depth. Good graphics & videography. I love SF anyway .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got this game on my Kindle for my 5yr old granddaughter. She can play it like crazy and just loves it. Very fast pace and requires quick reaction.
B007L6VR12|5.0|The most charming and brilliant love story. You'll want to watch it over and over again. Characters are unforgettable and the scenery is beautiful.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Did not hold my interest.  The modernized soundtrack was distracting. Effects could have used a bit more refinement. Needed more back story on the billboard glasses guy... what was that? Didn't read the classic so this is purely on the movie.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Just what I was looking for. Easy to use and no problems so far. Would definitely recommend at this time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first of at least three books the author, Howey, has published so far about life and community, in an underground silo. The story line centers around people, thousands of them, who live in an underground silo.  This society has been there so long that it's the only real world they know.  The silo is their world.  Their only view of the world outside the silo is provided by a wall screen on the top floor of the silo.  The view of the outside beyond the silo is of a hostile and lifeless land, worse, life taking, with far off remnants of crumbling skyscrapers.  To leave the silo is understood by all to be a death sentence.  Who are these people, where is this place and how did it come to be?  The characters and the story line immediately grabbed my attention and kept it.  It's well written and I couldn't wait to get back to it when ever I was forced to put it down.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love this show!  The story lines are varied; the dialog is sublime.  These shows are always full of interesting twists and turns and keep you interested through the end and wanting more!  One of the best shows on TV in this age of unreal reality shows!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is the first digital book I've ever ordered.  Very easy process, and I kind of like using the tablet as an e-reader.  The book was very revealing about what the real Jesus stood for and how he lived his life.  You hear so much crap about Jesus that it's obvious this is just an icon, where we've hung all our wishes and dreams.  This book reveals a real person who had a narrow viewpoint and narrow goals, as we all do.  Parts of the book are a little boring, when he goes into great detail about bible readings.  But I guess that's to be expected, as the bible has LOTS of boring and impossible to understand parts.  That's why 'believers' are always saying that we just don't understand it.  Well, I guess that's all too true!  But this Jesus was a very focused Jew, and he wanted the Jewish traditions to be upheld and held sacred.  Most Christians I know follow the teachings of Paul, and the teachings of Jesus were swept under the rug.  This book explains a LOT!
B005D6O12O|5.0|I love crocs! They are cushy and comfortable. Perfect for walking all day. I wore them on the Met tour; the woman and the seed. Wonderful!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I am enjoying watching the movies on Amazon.  Thank you for letting me know that I had this feature, it's excellent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i like playing the game. its nerve racking at times, but there is a way to win all the time to make you feel like a winner.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|This has been my very favorite album since high school (not saying how long that has been). Timeless for me.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is a great app to use to keep track of things across all platforms.  used on kindle fire, ipad, droid razr maxx,  and computers.
0812550706|4.0|Great Book in Great Condition. I've been looking for it for a while and Amazon had it. I was impressed with even the &#34;used&#34; quality.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|This is a top quality movie.  It has a great message and is so entertaining.  You are laughing one minute and thinking about the hidden messages the next.  i recommend it for all.
159463176X|3.0|I loved his 1st two books and maybe it's not fair to compare, but I'm going to. This one is very different in that it's many stories woven into one. I absolutely loved the beginning, but then it went onto another story which was a little hard to piece together, but still was good, but then it happened a couple more times and it got a little more confusing. I'm sure it didn't help that I had to put it down for a week before picking it up, perhaps if I had been able to read it straight through I would have not had as much of an issue. I found some of the characters and side stories not really relative to the main story and the ending was a bit of a let down.
1451695195|5.0|The author's credentials make this a most interesting book. I highly recommend this for all who wonder about the &#34;here-after&#34;
B007IO1X5C|4.0|This book was very interesting and well written The basic premise is that there is very little in this world that cannot be bought sold or traded. As consumers we are collectively kept in a pool of debt much of which we don't know. I have spent the last twenty years reducing what I own and what I owe Currently that puts me in the odd position of having zero debt which conversely means I am not a good candidate for banking or other financial institutions It is only with debt that we prove to be suitable borrowers This attitude of banks is a major factor in the GFC where bad debt was added to worse debt until it collapsed under its own weight.<br /><br />Reading this book shows how many ways people, corporations and governments can pay to be excluded from responsibility and the resulting debt passed onto the lower ter consumer most of whom cannot afford it
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Cute movie for the family!!!! My 2 year old and 10 year old loves it. Waiting on 2 to come out.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|WOW!!!!  This family is fantastic and keep giving the action.  I would love to see them all in an adventure together.  However, if not then I will settle for the father son duo again.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|It is a very good series.  It sure isn't an American series; since it has some different sexual situations you would not find on US Tv.  A good spin off from Doctor No.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent legal drama.  It has interesting legal cases along with some drama in the personal lives of the characters.  Unlike some other shows, the personal drama doesn't consume the show.  They've struck a perfect balance!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is incredibly funny and anybody can read it and I recommend it for wimpy kids that injoy good laughs.
B008HK3RVY|4.0|This is excellent quality and typical Timbuk2 design.  The case is a little stiff and so your tablet may be a tight fit at first but over time I am expecting it to loosen up.  I would highly recommend this case!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Loved every minute of this movie! I watched 3 times in a row! The acting is amazing and a great twist on the novel.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I like that the film is extremely creative and it has its own unique twist to it! The only the thing that I would advise is that there are some aspects of this film that can be disturbing but over all its an AMAZING film you MUST watch it!! :D
B00991TCOG|5.0|This cd is definitely the best cd I've purchased in years, can't get enough of it! Her music is simply mesmerizing!
B00EV4F5TC|5.0|I order the Blu Ray as a pre order and I have not received it yet but I have heard it was a very Good movie. It was so exciting to see that it could now be pre ordered! I had been checking Amazon almost daily to see if it was finally on their website! Really can't wait to receive it cause can't wait to view it at home!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its entertaining  and realistic and I like the fact that you can advance in the game with the competitions and care for your horse.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a good app it is fun only wished there were more weapons. It is one of the good one` s . Should make WW1 version also. Because they they did modern and WW 2.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Beautifully written work. Even as an adult I enjoy the story and the ease with which I could read this.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Love it just hope I could be a better cualaty but its all good hope they can make a new movie
B000BW7QX6|5.0|This was another great deal!  I had watched this online and really wanted it on DVD so that I could watch it over and over again.  The packaging was good and I had no delivery issues at all.  The price was also really good.
B0037BB00I|5.0|All selections are well worth listening to. Adele can really take you for another aspect of voice appreciation. What a talent!
B002GHHHKG|4.0|Bought this for my girlfriend since she has been scouring the bargain bins for a while now.  Story is a bit predictable in places and it has a few outright &#34;Ghost&#34; (the movie) scene borrows but overall a good story.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love using Emojis when I type so I thought this game would be fun for me. It's a good challenge so if you like a challenge then you will like this game.
0240815807|5.0|Really a great one to have handy in the studio.  Also found the monitoring section to be very comprehensive and useful - not many include this most important of topics.
0226039331|4.0|This work is helpful, very detailed. I'd like it better if it was keyed to the Strong's numbering system, but it is very useful as is. Like similar works, you'll have to get used to the abbreviation system, but that is no hill for a climber.
B000K3HTRY|5.0|This film was groundbreaking for me. I had no clue what the context was the first time I saw it, but it completely changed my life. It showed such beauty in the alternative styles of love and domination. Although fictional, it was such a beautiful way to explore these ideas. Far before 50 Shades.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Joey's first effort as Writer, Director AND Producer was fabulous. I read a review that called it, &#34;his love letter to science fiction&#34;...and it certainly was. Visually stunning and good story-telling...and, at times, very familiar...he subtly and not so subtly pulled in many of his favorite bits from other movies, characters, scenarios. And he also utilized every 3D model and computer-generated special effect he's been nursing since graduate school. That house looked very familiar....
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Good reading. I have enjoyed the first three books and can't wait for the follow on to see where it leads.
B0044DEAUA|3.0|Not a bad little blue tooth item, but suffers from the standard blue tooth issues...garbled, road noise, whatever.  I've tried a few and they all seem to be this way.  That being said, it is still very handy, installed easily, works reliably.  The magnetic holder is very convenient.  You can just snap the blue tooth off and on for charging, or even, on occasion, I've used it like a regular phone if the road noise was too much the normal way.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series has a grip on me!  I can't wait until the next season starts!  The characters are so believable. They take you back into the period making one wish you were there with them.  It's easy to slip into character yourself.  The costuming is fabulous!  So much fun to watch the progression of this family's life.
B008VBYN80|3.0|STANDARD CITY BUILDER, BUT AT LEAST IT DOESN'T CRASH OR TAKE FOREVER TO LOAD.  WISH THEY JUST HAD FARMVILLE...<br />Okay way to waste some time.
B00DYFCYSO|3.0|It should be said right away that I have been an enormous admirer of John Legend's musical and compositional acumen since the first time I heard [[ASIN:B0007KIGCW Ordinary People]] almost a decade ago believe it or not. Since than I have heard him make one brilliant song after another. And in a way that is the root of what I personally feel is Legend's most serious musical flaw: he has never been able to stretch the level of quality found within his individual compositions into a consistently satisfying album. His first three albums [[ASIN:B0002X314C Get Lifted]],[[ASIN:B000HCPWZO Once Again]] and [[ASIN:B001E7OO2I Evolver]] all contain a handful of amazing tunes. But also one ill suited concessions to the shallowest end of the hip-hop crowd after the other-not to mention a number of production ideas that often just don't work for his talents. On his previous album with The Roots,a sense of direction began to emerge. As he re-emerged for this new album I was eagerly anticipating,it was rather hard to hold back my own keen sense of disappointment.<br /><br />  First of all I'll say his cover of the underrated Bobby Caldwell's \\"Open Your Eyes\\",with it's wonderfully reverbed vocal and Anita Baker's \\"Angel\\",with the sadly rather vocally mediocre (at least here so it sounds here) Stacy Barthe are highlights. But both are cover songs. Of the none cover songs,the situation is the same as every other John Legend album I've heard: unevenness to the extreme. \\"Who Do You Think We Are\\" is a wonderfully swelling and soulful number about being a show couple which,in my opinion is ruined by Rick Ross's extremely shallow rap-hideously dated in it's misogyny and materialism on the bridge of the song that,again was utterly unneeded. \\"Hold Me Longer\\" is a beautifully sensual groove with some powerful [[ASIN:B00004S36A Talking Book]] era Stevie Wonder synthesizer orchestrations. \\"Dreams\\",ending with a psychedelic vocordized outro,is a similarly powerful affair.<br /><br />  So why no reviews of the other songs? Well honestly? \\"Soul on top\\" is as good as term as I can come up with for it. The production of this album is so concerned with creating aural soundscapes from drums,organs,samples and different echo effects that the production of the grooves themselves is almost entirely neglected. Many of the songs seem to be lacking entirely in bass lines or any kind of rhythm at all. It's all just a little too bland. The songwriting is very strong. But on this album especially,it is almost entirely lacking in uptempo material. And the dark tone that permeates even the brightest moments of this album give it the feel of playing the piano outside on a dank and rainy day-wet from head to foot. It's satisfying perhaps on a detached and alienated level. But it does little to nothing in the way of elevating the soul,heart or even the feet. Perhaps in the future John Legend would be wise to consolidate his best songs and expand the accompanying albums from where those are and concentrate on more rhythmic productions-feeding the feet,heart,mind and soul. And this album,as with most of his,is rather unsatisfactory on that level frankly.eviews of the other songs? Well honestly? \\"Soul on top\\" is as good as term as I can come up with for it.

B00006D295|4.0|This is the most entertaining example of the Rock Music genre I have ever seen! I've watched it more times than I can count and I enjoy it every time I do. When these songs keep running through your head, you don't ever wish they'd stop!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|More entertaining than angry birds. Tons of fun for all ages. Great graphics. I've of the best free games I've played in a long time.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This book was as complete a picture of the Steve Jobs that people who were close to him - family, friends and coworkers/staff - that I have found. I enjoyed the writing, the organization of the book, and the inside information the author was able to provide. I'm happy that I bought the Kindle version because I've had reason to refer to it several times already. Great read!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The series was a great read.  However, the final book was not, in my opinion, the best of the three reads.  But overall, I would recommend the series... great entertainment.
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game by Orson Scott Card is a must read for Sci-Fi enthusiasts. Its an adventure set in the future where the human race is at war the the buggers, a potentially lethal extraterrestrial civilization looking to wipe out mankind.  Ender Wiggin is a young boy taken from his family at birth and raised to become the ultimate military commander. Its a wild adventure where you the reader and Ender discover new things about himself and others. Its a book that's hard to put down, and is as enjoyable to read as anything else on the market today!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Inspiring and right on! I love that I get all of these spiritual reminders with such a wicked sense of humor. I laughed out loud and that is good for my soul!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|The movie is fantastic. I have read that some fans and viewers were dissatatisfied with the movie but I don't see why. Between the battle of Star Trek vs Star Wars, it is my opinion that Star Trek did a much better job bringing public interest back through these movies. Episode one anyone?! Jar Jar Binks? Please. A great movie with a fantastic platform for future Star Trek movies!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I download this to my iPod and kindle, my grandsons (3 &amp; 9 ) love playing this game and even have me addicted to it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I gave this book a five star rating because of it's profound wisdom and glimpse into the affects of abuse at the hands of adults that misuse their positions of power and responsibilities. Beautifully written, capturing the essence of life's journey of mankind with all its cruelties, kindness, loneliness, desires and despair.  Yet, demonstrating that life's pain can lead to a world where healing and grace meet helping us to realize that with trust there really are no accidents in life. Truly refreshing.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Great family show and very enjoyable.  Excellent screen writing and acting well done.  We need more shows similar to this for good family entertainment.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the second SOLITAIRE game I've downloaded and its become my favorite. I like the way it's played out and how it keeps track of your highest score. Occasionally it will run slow but you just have to get out of it and go back in. I would highly recommend
078881172X|4.0|The case was old, dried up, crisp and ripped. I actually cut my finger on it. The tape/movie was fine.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Well placesd characters create a book that hard to put down. Definitely a buzz kill when youve read the last page
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this story because it is about a subject I've been following for 20 years now, and have, what I think is a sound working knowledge about.......health care.....and the how our ridiculous system.....makes us all potentially, ... Mr. White.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|History buffs will love it! I can't wait for an update. Would like to see more german weapons! perhaps a flamethrower
B009YG2ND8|1.0|I paid for this game and it didn't download....................my son has been wanting this and is disappointed. I am too
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|That illustrates the immorality of killing machines and cloning in a way that doesn't feel like \\"Terminator 5.\\" The CGI is so well done you don't mind the limited color palette of the action scenes.  If I had to nitpick it would be that there are a few too many aggressively dramatic sound effects and close ups.  But with a story this compelling and a style this futuristic it doesn't matter.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Great story, lots of action. One of Tom's better movies. Great special effects and any movie with Morgan Freeman cant be bad.
1594203334|5.0|Wish I had had some of this info when I was having my kids!  I bought the book for my son and daughter-in-law to read before their first baby arrives.  They are enjoying it and hope to incorporate some of the concepts as they raise their bebe in Sweden.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|PURCHASED TO WATCH BACK ISSUES OF UNDER THE DOME. OOPS! IF NO ONE SUPPORTS THE CHROMECAST MINI-TV SYMBOL (AND VERY FEW DO) THEN IT IS WORTHLESS. SENDING MINE BACK.<br /><br />New News. Up and running using Chrome Browser. Have to get up ever 15-20 minutes because Chrome drops the Chromecast stating \\"cannot find Chromecast\\". Desktop 20 feet away from TV that has Chromecast installed. Wireless indicator on TV full strength. What a bummer. Wife and I had to go into the study to finish watching Under the Dome on the PC display.
B00004TDTO|5.0|I HADN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE FOR A WHILE ! MY BROTHER HAD IT BUT HE LOST IT ! IT WAS THE FIRST MOVIE I SAW IN A THEATER AS A CHILD , I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE BEGINNING WITH THE PEOPLE ON THE BEACH, AND THE GIRL GOES SWIMMING! AND WHEN THE CAPTAIN OF THE BOAT IS TALKING ABOUT THE USS INDIANAPOLIS,BOTH SETTINGS ARE SET IN THE DARK KIND OF EERIE, GOOD MOVIE TO WATCH ON A WEEKDAY OR ANY DAY FOR THAT MATTER ! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE BUY IT !!!
B003ASLJO0|5.0|I grew up watching Clint Eastwood and he has always been one of my favorite actors.  This movie is touching and humorous. It deals with teens, racism, gangs, dysfunctional families and how a lonely hateful old man deals with all. Watch it! You won't be sorry!
B00095NX9G|4.0|My daughter loves this DVD. It is very challenging. If you are up for it it is a great DVD lesson.
B00005JPNY|4.0|Love the movie (but as always in my opinion the books are so much more detailed)!! Just wish the would make the sequels ...
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|i love this game! it gets really easy in the beginning but then it gets hard. but i love it!! (:
B00AREIAI8|5.0|First i got this app on my phone and was obsessed with it and when the kindle version came out i was COMPLETLEY PSYCHED. I LOVE MY HORSE!!!!!!!!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Good ap..easy to use and understand. I would recommend it to anyone. Colorful and bold graphics.  Good choice all around.
0316017930|1.0|Likes to engage is data mining approach to make his arguments, and just wanted to espouse his view on how interactions with the environment and cultures should work. Talent is talent and his view is so what - more effort will get near equivalent result. Bunk, my becoming the next MJ isn't happening. Devoted a significant portion of his work to promoting year-around school, and avoided the obvious problem with underachievers - the lack of parental ability and responsibility for upbringing and any thoughts on how to address this issue.
B00457WT9Y|5.0|Awesome entries from an awesome writer! Very easy to read and soooo much lighter than having the actual book, which I do have btw. Thanks!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is...wait for it...... Legendary!  It's easy at first, but just wait... it gets plenty challenging down the road.  The only thing I don't like is that there's no penalty for the ships coming down past you.  in the original Space Invaders.... once the aliens got down to the bottom, it was game over.  This game is more like Galaga or Galaxian.  I also wish that if you get a weapon near the end of a run, that you could keep it for awhile for the next stage.  One thing I really love is the sheer number of different aliens that are in this game.  Way cool!  Completely worth the cost.
B00544L9EI|4.0|I came upon this CD totally by accident and was not aware that it came out in 2011. The songs are a collaboration between Eminem and Royce. This album was under the radar for me perhaps because it was not cataloged under Eminem’s name.  Once I listened to the CD a couple times, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.<br /><br />This is old school Eminem. The guy you don’t introduce to your parents; the women-disrespecting, homophobic, smart-alec rapper who drives the song forward with his abrasive lyrics and sweet beats. Both rappers work well together. I find the songs to have a good synergy between the two styles and lyrics.<br /><br />Looking at this from an Eminem perspective, I found his last album “Recovery” to be rather disappointing and pretty much an attempt to apologize for his past.  Hell: The Sequel dismisses all of his paltry attempts at a 12-step recovery plan and goes back to the aspects that made him successful.<br /><br />For those who like Eminem and sometimes chuckle at the abusive things he may say, this album is worth your money.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Good read really enjoyed this book downloading the next ones now! It's a must read for sure. Great job Jill
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Kind of a strange movie, but it is entertaining. Worth it for the out of this world scenery of post apocalyptic earth
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I was given seasons 1 and 2 for a birthday gift a few years ago and didn't even realize I didn't have the 3rd season until I got my sister hooked on watching it. (It's on most days on Soapnet) It ended as a series far too soon and is enjoyable to watch - and now the movie's being made with most of the same actors - what fun!
B00007KWHG|4.0|These guys will always be a part of music history, and their hits remain some of the best music of all time!  The 4 Seasons helped define and express the 60s as much as any group of that era.
0553801473|5.0|I haven't read A Dance with dragons yet, but I'm enjoying watching the series on HBO. I really liked reading the 1st 4 books and can't wait to get started on this one!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Entertaining and addicting! Couldn't stop watching. Always an interesting turn in the story line. Now to wait for season 4.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The book was well-written and hard to put down.  The family members were all beautifully defined and easy to follow.  The story was full of surprises.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B006VREOOY|3.0|I'm still curious how this movie ends. I generally like anything with Jason Statham but amazon downloads seem to fail unpredictably. Maybe someday I'll see the end, but amazon doesn't seem to have a contingency for failed downloads, so I guess I'm out the good money they charged me for this show. I guess I'll go back to trying my luck at the Walmart $4.99 DVD bin.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|I loved this movie. It's all about the good guy with the right motives. The Captain figures it out.  Please watch this with your children.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|My wife read this. When I asked how many stars to give she said \\"all the stars\\". I suppose that says it all!
B009AY04A8|3.0|I like hidden object games but I find the dialogue too lengthy and annoying when you have to repeat a task.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|Preface: emptor caveat. If you expect this album to resemble his past work in any way, thought this was a rap album, or were hoping this album shows the evolution of west's talent, you're in for a disappointment. It is none of the above. It is however brilliant in its own right in that it displays kanye at his most uninhibited, which makes for an album which has ups and downs, classic verses and some less inspired songs, awesome production on some and cringeworthy on others. Despite its lows, the album is one of kanye's most creative. Some will be able to appreciate it. Some will love it simply because it's different. Some will be afraid to buy anything else by kanye in the future. But all told, a very good album.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|This was recommended to me by my daughter who really liked it.  I cannot say it appealed to me as it did to her.  Interesting story but somehow not what I was expecting.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben has captured my attention into the life beyond with his book.  The way he wrote it with so much clarity of the excursion into the beyond, I truly hated for the book to end.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a seriously addictive game! Wish they made more as good as this one!!!I love it! No problems with it at all
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|A very good read. I liked how Child is developing the Reacher character.  I am looking forward to the next book.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|If your a fan of ZZ Top at this price you can't go wrong! First of all the sound quality is top notch!!!  Second it's all here, all their memorable hit's from their debut album  to the tenth album offered in this collection are all your favorites. If your a fan replacing all your cassettes this is the deal for you, & If your a youngster courteous about this classic band its a introduction you will never forget! For the price this set is offered it just shouldn't be passed up, I have heard some complaint's about a lack of extra's & booklet's but if you want to read about the three Texas Blues Icon's buy a biography! Each C.D. comes in a replica of the original album cover art work, I don't necessarily like cardboard sleeve's as I believe they scratch up the C.D.'s faster, but with today's technology transfer the to a disc to listen to & save the originals for source material!  I am a bit tired of people complaining about a lack of this & why not that, when a very accurate product description is provided for you !!! Every one of these ten C.D.'s will probably have music you are familiar with. ZZ Top's debut album produced the hit &#34;Backdoor Love Affair.&#34; & the tenth C.D. offered in this collection contains the hit from the final Back to the future movie &#34; Doubleback&#34;. As far as the music contained in this three decade spanning collection...Well Its ZZ Top Their unique brand of Texas rocking Blue's exudes sex, partying & good time Rock & Roll. The Blue's influence in their music is audibly obvious but it is almost an oxymoron to call their music the Blue's as it is such feel good music! But the sound quality of the re-mastering of these classic album's is outstanding well worth five stars! If your like me its all about the music & this is a great price to update my collection. If your a younger Rock & Roll fan I envy the experience you will have discovering such a back log of outstanding music. Its really hard to believe that three men can make such a rich & raucous sound! When I saw this was being offered & advertised as being restored from the original source material I got on Facebook & let my friend's know, many thanked me & one said &#34;I already ordered it!&#34; If you don't care about booklet's & other assorted whistles & bell's jump on this incredible deal while it last's !!!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but turned out to have several surprises that I didn't see coming.
B005544V6A|4.0|i enjoy every episode.. i am planning on becoming a corporate lawyer and this show really gets me prepared for it
B00571F26Y|5.0|As a German nutritionist, I have avoided wheat or grains already for a long time. I also hold lots of lectures about nutrition and why grains (wheat) are not good for us. This is a very well written book which is easily understandable for every one (not just a scientific person). So thank you to William Davis for publishing this book.<br />Friederike Feil
B008NHS5K4|5.0|Found an album from this lady from the 1960's at a garage sale.Listening to it , it sounded as though I was in an Italian restaurant being sung to. I have no idea what she is singing, but love every song I've heard so far. Heard she has done some thing in German, which I have not heard yet, but her early French works are worth looking into. A few songs sounded like American songs done in French, but using an online translator they do not translate to anythings in english tunes.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I really enjoy the fact that you can get a report on several different locations and the forecasts are generally spot on.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have been engrossed with Downton Abbey since season one and look forward to season 4! Maggie Smith is wonderful.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|Good clean fun from a classic author.  They just don't make 'ém like this any more.  Great acting, wonderful costumes, beautiful scenery.  A chick flick for sure!
B003U4UPTE|4.0|It's really addictive. when u can watch the next episode without waiting a week, the hours fly by.....ooops, what was I doing?!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is a great game I advise everyone who likes history or art should get this game. even if u don't like history or art still., get it. I'm a game reviewer. get it.! people say there's ads that pop up either u r crazy or I got a good kindle........
B0067Q42BY|5.0|An absolutely kewl app with great graphic novel story line.  Mahjong players old and young will enjoy.  Great starter game too.
B000SCHC0Q|2.0|I am glad to have read Hosseini's &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;. The author is a solid storyteller and presents an informative view of Afghanistan's history over the past 30-50 years, through the eyes of Afghanistani women. However, should I have read a short history of Afghanistan's recent past, I believe I would have been comparably enriched. Further, I would not have been exposed to quite so many excessively disheartening and even gruesome depictions.<br /><br />When navigating Hosseini's prose, I felt that the author was somewhat nihilistically focused on scenes of pain, grief and loss. Throughout the better part of the novel, every brief spark of life that Hosseini creates is inevitably extinguished, and with a level of excruciating detail not present in its creation. The primary theme of the work seems to be survival through near intolerable pain, but only survival, never anything more.<br /><br />If the author's only goal was to present a political statement about the pain and desperation associated with being an Afghanistani woman over the past 50 years, then I would consider the book a success. But in terms of the development of character and illustration of fictional events that can lead us to a deeper understanding of our own experience, I found the novel to be severely lacking.
B0076HNCTQ|4.0|Missed this when it was hot and catching up with it now. Fun to see the stars so young. The show is entertaining but corny (not campy). There are a lot of characters and story lines which allow them to suddenly introduce new ones. My favorite part is the opening credits.
B000099T2L|5.0|Got this cd for my sisters bday and she loved it I got it sooner than what I thought I was scared that I was not going to get my order just in time but I did
0307352153|5.0|the book came very quick and is in depth with practical excises to do easy to read and understand. Really gets your mind working. A must read, for any one who, who working of coming out of there shell.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|Toca Hair Salon 2 is a Wonderful game for all ages.  The 6 Cute Characters make realistic movements and Funny sounds while their Hair flows and is manageable like real hair.  There are many Tools and Accessories to use in a variety of ways to create NEW LOOKS and Style.  Such an Enjoyable process that everyone can have a great time using stylish creativity and experimenting with all kinds of changes. You can even GROW more Hair to enhance your stylish creations.  Graphics have Smooth, Fluid like movements that are awesome to work with.  You can also take a PHOTO of your creation with your hand picked background and save it to your photo gallery. Controls are not perfect and NO UNDO feature but maybe future updates will improve that.<br /><br />Overall, an Engaging game that has endless possibilities and is Entertaining Fun for all ages.  Especially great for kids but even a mature male (like me) can have lots of Silly Fun with it.<br />It looks great and works well.  Thankfully, it has No intrusive Annoyances, unreasonable Permissions or objectionable Addons.  Kudos to TOCA BOCA for this.  I do subtract 1 Star because of no UNDO feature and slightly off Controls.  I reccomend it highly though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series gets better with each season.  The actors stay true to their characters, the storyline continues to intrigue and each episode feeds the adiction.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|he loved it. i brought this for my hubby because he loved this movie, and he had no complaints. good movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|excellent game....highly enjoyable....its a game I enjoy playing as well as the little ones. but are there more than just those three worlds?
B00847KFDS|5.0|I go all the way back with John Fogerty and CCR. In fact, I attended the rival high school to theirs and even remember hearing them play at school events. And many times since, at the Filmore, the Greek Theater and even from the back of trucks. Over the years, I've never tired of his/their work. With the arrival of &#34;Wrote a Song For Everyone&#34;, John's back in the center of my daily playlist.<br /><br />The collaborations on and treatments of Fogerty's work is so consistently exciting and compelling that I literally have the experience of getting stuck on each song, one after the other. This doesn't happen often, though I did have the same experience with Mumford & Sons. On &#34;Wrote&#34;, John does a brilliant job of showcasing the strengths of his guest artists and then injecting what almost seems like an interpretation of himself in accompaniment. It's pretty remarkable, and typically JF.<br /><br />Rather than go into great detail, I'll simply say that if you have any interest in John Fogerty's catalog, you are very, very likely to love this album. It is genuinely a 5-star effort.
081297381X|5.0|Came very late to this book which is a really excellent treatise for the layman on uncertainty. However, I can't help observing that one J. M. Keynes covered some similar ground in a book published in 1936 and which I read (with great difficulty in parts) as a student in the early 60's. Recent events in the financial world make both highly relevant and it's pity that sometime in the 80's the political and economic establishment started to believe some essentially rather silly ideas about human rationality and predictability using complex mathematical models as proof. Unfortunately, the algebra didn't work and one wonders if we've really learned anything given the $6 billion JPM lost just last year. In short a marvelous book which will cause me to read the author's previous Fooled by Randomness.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|It was so cool to see Kirk's humble beginnings as a farm hand, then his recruitment into Starfleet. Actually, it was cool to see all the beginnings of the original Star Trek characters. Loaded with action and fun through the whole film, this movie won't disappoint.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is fun. The only thing I would change isto add more of a variety of people to give makeovers to. I don't like that monkey man or whatever he is. It would also be cool if the customers could freak out after their haircut. Our express if they like it. More assessors would be nice as well. All in all fun.
B0035LGXXO|4.0|A timeless movie. But nowadays, you can't help but think how much easier it'd be on the fellows if they had cell phones. :-) Seriously though, it's an all-around fun and entertaining flick.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|excellent.  we so enjoyed the music and really everything about it .Maggie was wonderful.  wish I had had time to watch it again within the 48 hour periodl
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|She is just so amazing, hope she embarks on a US tour as soon as possible! Definitely recommend this album.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so great... it keeps my brother and me occupied for hours... you need to make a 2nd one.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|another great book by Kate Morton.  Love the style and the format in which it is written from the past to the present.
B0002S947K|4.0|Great sound and some non-radio songs that are just wonderful. I love his voice and the flow of the tracks is nice. A future classic.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An immoderately well written piece! This is a great book & has left me yearning to read the second book in the trilogy!!!! I will probably start on it right NOW, since the end of the first book leaves u entirely perplexed!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good story lines a fast read<br /> Keeps you guessing  Hard to put down.<br />Looking forward to reading more of her books soon.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I know that a lot of die-hard trek fans are not impressed with this latest installment into the Trekverse, but I loved this movie! It's fun! The action and the dialogue are fun. You can tell that the actors were having fun making this movie, and that made watching it even more fun.  I won't give away anything, but if you love the 'verse and you love a good story; you'll love this movie.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book provides fun experiments that show the manifestation process works..  I did all the experiments and had results..  This book is a fun read and explains the manifestation process in a new way thats more scientific..
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Remember Judge Dredd? That awful movie from the '90s? This isn't that bad. Reviews of Dredd made it sound like it would be an awesome piece of cinema. It's not. It is a good movie to escape into though. I watched for Karl Urban and kept watching to see the good guys would win.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|EVERYONE GIVE THIS DUMB APP ONE STAR TO LET THEM KNOW THEY SHOULD FINALLY HAVE THE ACTUAL GAME ON HERE ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!! GEEZ, WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!! YOUR COMPANY WOULD GET SO MUCH MORE BUSINESS!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it.  There are very few books that I would want to read and read again but this is one.  The writing was so colorful I even added the Netherlands to my &#34;must go&#34; list.
B008XG1X18|5.0|As a senior citizen you have made everything do user-friendly for me. I get to see the world through the eyes of others, and share their many ideas.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. Gets better with age!  He played Tony Stark so well.  I love the Amazon Instant Player feature of Amazon.  The HD quality was awesome and bottom line, we were able to watch the movie with a quick press of a button.  Renting this movie was super convenient!
B00433SVP6|5.0|If you like Percy Jackson, you will fall in love with this book, great reading for all ages, it brings out your inner child and gives you a break from the real world
0670026557|5.0|An easy-to-read, fresh look at how people work. Plus well-grounded in research without being stuffy. A celebration of the 'givers' who do it right.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|If you like Percy Jackson, you will fall in love with him in this book, great reading for all ages, it brings out the inner child in you
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but not so difficult that you can&acute;t level up.<br />Once I got started, this gave was very addictive! Love it!
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|I love fantasy books and this is just delightful, nice reading for all ages, I recommend it 100% especially for teenagers!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|My first game for my kindle. I like it quite a bit. Great for taking to the rest room to get some quiet from my girlfriend.
B0037QM8YA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely. It shows how one can make it out of the depths of poverty and abuse into the light with a little help from friends and government assistance. There are many young girls out there living in abuse and poverty, but they need educational programs like the one in the movie to help. It shows that we can't just give money away, but we have to educate along the way.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Exactly what I expected to see.  Throwback action flick while being mildly entertained by classic tough guys with cheesy liners.  Fun to watch...just not much more to expect than 80's action genre.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|works great does wat I need it to very loud gives weather. u can set up to 3 alarms unless u upgrade.  but it is great
B007HVBW2A|5.0|I wanted my daughter to see what a true horror movie was all about-compared to all the hack and slash movies she is used to watching. Then I encouraged her to read the book which was also excellent!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I also liked the discs that came with the Next Generation and the Original Motion Picture collection that were fun to watch, too.
B00003CXV4|1.0|The dbds do not work in my dvd so they ate being returned this is the second time the say check regional code tjanking you
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|These movies are really worth having. I liked each movie for different reasons and thought that 2 - 4 were especially good although I enjoyed each of them very much.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|A friend recommended this, said I had to see it, and was not disappointed. Matthew McConaughey has never registered with me, but his performance is so strong. The real surprise was Ellis, the lead boy, and his friend, Neck Bone. This starts out as a small story and just grows and deepens.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Definitely well worth the $. Love this app, I use it a lot. Very impressed with the quality. I would recommend this app for anyone who loves editing pictures.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I appreciate the recounting of the interviews with those who worked with and for Jobs... but at the end Jobs is exposed as a pecularly talented and intelligent guy who succeeded per the energy he channeled as an anti-establishment product of the 60's and 70's.  The &#34;jump&#34; from his Dad's garage to corporate status is not ( in my opinion) examined in any depth.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As with most of Clancy's work, his story is frighteningly close to potential reality. Let's hope it stays a gripping novel and never become fact.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Speaking as a physician who acted as ME for 35 yrs.  ( not a pathologist), I was ....well, disappointed in the courtroom testimony as well as the evidence of the knife wounds..  All in a row ?  Same level ?  Depth ?  Three entry wounds ???  Come on.  It is common knowledge that after the first thrust and DURING the first thrust the victim would be moving and changing positions.  The initial wound could be distinguished by its configuration which reflects this movement and subsequent wounds would have to be made post mortem or post conscious to be at the same horizontal level.  A forensic pathologist should have been testifying at trial in addition to the criminologist.....  The description of the wounds suggests a pattern..and, restraint or purpose....  Otherwise I liked the book....
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I like 3D in the movies and found the 3D on the disk convincing with my Sony BDP-S5100 Blue-ray Disk Player and Panasonic 55ST60 plasma.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game, Its a simple enough concept but its quite a bit of fun. I really enjoy playing this during breaks at work and other times.  just a good little time killer.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|A roller coaster from beginning to end.  The role reversal was great, both from the plot perspective as well as from the character perspective.  Will watch this one over and over again.  And I can't say enough about Benedict Cumberbatch.  He can do it all, and his portrayal of a monster with a heart was not what I expected.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|My son downloaded but he didn't get to quite figure out what purpose it served, because his tablet tore up.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Good story, great characters, the writing and performances you expect from Masterpiece Theater. I rolled through Season 1 and 2 as quickly as I could manage and can't wait to start on Season 3.
0824835921|5.0|Again my second copy-the first is so marked up that I will need a second some time.  I wanted to order it while the the sixth Edition was still available for sale.  I am just finishing the last chapters and although it is well ontructed, I have really beat it up by carrying with me on my trips.  And the Amazon price is exactly half the Maruzen Tokyo price.
B0055V0GQC|5.0|A deligh! One of those you're auditioning and a revelation of musical brilliance occurs.Has a Zep vibe w/o too much derivation
0061122416|5.0|this is a good book.  My is reading it for his English class.  why are we asking for so much question.
B008BZIUHG|5.0|This group needs more exposure as has it all. Was truly a delight to sit and listen to(SEE 'Pressure & Time' review)
0525478817|5.0|my daughter is reading this book  she said&#34; she love it . it is interested.  i haven't read it myself.  so far i have no compvenderlaint everything i buy its good.  the
B001684L0A|5.0|We watched this mini-series at our own speed and caught up as missed a few episodes. Extremely well-done and detailed (to point of portraying some very unflattering (ie., realistic)) aspects of persons and time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use has all the functions you need for every day use.<br />Great for children who are learning to use a calculator.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|The original Star Wars Trilogy on Blu-ray, hopefully people don't need these reviews to figure out if it's worth it.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and the young boys determination to help a person in need. My son and my grandsons told me about this so had to watch it, Thank you Amazon for the offer of such good movies.
B009LDD54K|5.0|i love the fact it came a day sooner it was in a great condition i love it and my boyfriend even loved it more
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This App is really fun and its exciting when u get a new horse I really really really love this game
B003XRELGQ|5.0|This was a very thought invoking book.  Science, religion, death, love, infatuation, power---this book has it all and more.  Can't help wonder what if ice nine was real???  The world as we know it would no longer exist.  Fabulous read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thought this show was awesom. I found if recently. And watched all 3 series day and night till I finished<br />The servants are funnier the the Royels
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Very entertaining with action from all the old time action stars.  Now I really want to see Expendables 1, would you?
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|this is a cool game to play, it can be very relaxing, cool music. some parts are not so relaxing, like when you're trying to beat a level or can't do it. but you can speed up the motion or slow it down.
B003B02PEU|5.0|Loved it! John Grisham never dissapoints me! He keeps me glued throughout the story and sad and missing the charactors when I finish reading the book!!! Can't wait till October to read his new one!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|this game got me into all of the clue and escape type games. it's challenging enough but you can finish all floors.
B002MY9NF0|1.0|thought it might be better this time - but still more than terrible, what a waste of money, definitely not worth renting
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I ordered this movie for my 5 year old granddaughter and watched it with her.  The animation is outstanding and the story line was appealing to kids and adults.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I have to say I was skeptical when the first of the two new Star Trek Movies came out.  So far, i'm very impressed with the acting and effects.  Zachary Quinto does a superb job as young Spock!  His voice even sounds like Leonard Nimoy's which adds to the experience since this is a prequel.  I think he steals the show.  Chris Pine does a good job as Kirk but there's still something missing.  The tie-ins with older movies and shows are funny and well done.  They are easy to spot in most cases.  I would definitely recommend this movie.
184448551X|5.0|Good explanation, good illustrations. I wasn't impressed with the projects because they all seemed pretty modern to me but still it is a good jumping off point for historical work.
B0071AKB38|4.0|Works as promised.  It is a little finicky when connecting to it via Bluetooth.  It worked well with an iPhone but connecting to a Windows phone, I had to make sure it connected in the correct format to playback.  The buttons are also so close together and touchy that if you pick it up during playback it is easy to cause the Bluetooth connection to drop or at least the speaker to go silent so that I had to turn everything off and start it back up to get it to work again.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|I really love this case! I never thought a case would make me fall in love with my iphone? Such a well designed case that fits the iphone 5 like a glove! Seamless beauty!
B0043UB0EI|3.0|This series is entertaining and has a good superficial story line. However, the nudity and content makes it a very unfriendly family viewing series. Guess it depends on what you're looking for as to whether it is your cup-of-tea.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great writing and enjoyable.  It was not exactly how history. Is written. Sorry I waited so long to watch the Tudors
B00E1L9N8E|2.0|Has Hollywood become so starved for material that it has to pump up and remake old movies?  Robert Redford's Gatsby movie was pretty good, if the story had to be brought to the big screen at all. A lot of money was spent on this new version, money that the real Gatsby, if he ever existed, could never afford. The millions spent do not make this a better story or a better movie. Fitzgerald's much heralded but Sophomoric tale has gained nothing but a lot of sound and fury  but still signifies nothing. Not worth the time or the money.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I just love Imagine Dragons.<br />They sound absolutely amazing. A lot of their songs became hits, and they woth it.
B00DGKVW9Y|5.0|Just tested all day the machine matched with Jays Three earbud ( Sweden made ) . The sound quality is gorgeous ( flat mode )  , really near to Hi End , battery life is really great , only human interface could be better but with that sound we can't say nothing more !!!<br />I ensure you that no noise of every kind come out from this wonderful player . I don't know wich earbud match has done the other reviewer that speaks of hiss noise ... It' s simply gorgeous , no more to say .<br />( copland 266/Audioquest Jade / Monotriode 300 B / Kimber / Klipsch La Scala ) my home set up , to give u an idea of wich ear write this evaluation . ;-)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It sucks you in, you can't stop watching!It is extremely addicting. Too many late nights catching up this season's episodes!
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Loved the book, actors, New Orleans, music. Wish I could have seen the original before the edits. Save your money.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Once you start watching, you can't stop! This series gives you a real sense of living in this time period.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Recordings Dave made on the Neve board (with artists who made history with albums they recorded at Sound City) after moving it to his home studio.  Very, very good.
B009AY04A8|5.0|The games I like best are the search games.  This is quite fun and has a story too.  I also like the levels in each section.  I will buy more of this type.  Had another and all they asked for was more money.  This one does not.  Very enjoyable.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game it reminds me of SIM city and I like how many options there are.<br />I recommend that you try this game but it can be addictive.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|No character development and no story.  The original was better.  The slo mo was not effective or appealing in telling any story.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I'm a fan of multiple versions of Les Mis.  This version is one  of my favorites, but one must enjoy musicals and have an understanding of the story to appreciate this one.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is for people that believe in mental powers and that know about spirituality.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and bought copies for my sisters.  I plan to go back to it to remind me to live fully every day.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The storyline of  love story with a quadriplegic was unusual but interesting.  The lead character is quirky with her outrageous style and caring qualities.  She develops into a swan before the story ends.  I could not put this book down.  The ending was heartbreaking but beautiful.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves romance novels.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Required viewing for seniors, especially those appreciating good music.  Loaning it now to my senior friends!  You will not be disappointed...Maggie Smith is wonderful, and Tom, Courtney is marvelous!
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|This movie is a mess.  I didn't like anyone in this movie.  The book was great and I think they have made a least 3 movies, the best film was Robert Redford as Gatsby, but I wouldn't recommend that either.
B00AEFY5TI|4.0|We bought the movie because we are going on a Cruise over Halloween and wanted to review the costumes....Fun movie!
B001V7UXG2|4.0|Hugh Laurie is definitely not Gregory House in this series.  It's not hilarious like MASH or BlackAdder, but it is an enjoyable series.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Read the full series (both if them)  and although they can get a but convoluted here and there, the story line and world created and the people and family lines all make for a rich tale and well woven world.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|so cool!!! Absolutely captivating. When you pick it up you wont stop reading it till the very last page. with a twist of romance, and lots of action.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Immensely enjoyable read with twists, turns and a look inside the heads of &#34;non-normal&#34; people. Read it in a day. Will think about it for many days
B008XX6J4C|3.0|Love their video's on utube. The album is ok. It's just that I was hoping for more piano than cello.<br />Several selections are sans any apparent piano.<br />For some reason their videos are more vibrant than the the album, but that's just me
B006RXPTNM|4.0|Anything Meryl Streep!  Makes you think...  I like that it constantly makes you &#34;doubt&#34; the outcome.  I recommend it to all who like busting religion.
B002QCAXOS|3.0|This was a very strange older movie. Lots of unexpected nudity and sexual inuendos. Hardly believable what happens to the policeman. Quite the strange island!
B003U4UNPK|4.0|Two words  Great Show. :-) Got to watch twice,with a long breack between them. Then look and compair your life to what the story is showing you about life it self.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is an awesome read for all ages. The individual characters are so developed and the actual real pictures draw you I deep and fast. You start caring about them very quickly. I had a hard time stopping once I started and it left me thirsty for more I didn't want it to end!!! Also this is set to be a movie by Tim Burton 2015!!!!!!! And the next book will be out Jan 2014!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addictive and fun ( even my son enjoyed it). Great game and it was free! Can't wait for the update!
B006VREHRS|5.0|Great show.  We can't watch them fast enough!  I highly recommend these.  though fiction lots of it is historically accurate.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good found it hard gets your brain going sometimes frustrating. As well but keeps you guessing.10rooms need more quite addictive at times ho bed thinking what's next.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very easy read, great mystery with twist and turns.  I love the author's wit and humor.  Best book I read in a long time...almost read all of it on my plane trip to UK.
B00AEFXZJE|5.0|I love this movie! It's a timeless classic with a great story line. I would recommend this movie for all ages because kids now a days need to watch a good movie rather than all of the garbage that's in theaters now.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I downloaded this for my 4 and 5 year old grandchildren.  It is fast moving and exciting.  The kids love the action and color.  The object is to get lots and lots of bananas without getting hit by the cars or buses. It is not gruesome so ok for little kids.  You do get better with practice.  The one thing I did not like is that you can buy  more moves with real money.<br />I would recommend this for kids, but adults may enjoy it too.

B00ENBTI8C|1.0|purchased this season same as the others, however, I can't view it because it is not the more expensive HD version. Good thing this was only 15.00. Amazon has lost a good customer!
1607066017|5.0|I like the coloring and the art style, the story is very refreshing compared to some other things I've read. Im actaully a very stingy person with my money, and I read this via the comixology app on my kindle fire. I now plan to buy the paper back version of this one and the second.

B00006AW2G|1.0|I ordered it. I never received it. How to rate something you paid for but never received? I am disappointed. I only hope this doesn't happen to other customers. Good luck.
