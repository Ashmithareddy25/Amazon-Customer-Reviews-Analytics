0953104907|5.0|A comprehensive guide to the task of guitar making, all the better for being English, with references to essential purchases and specialist stuff which can be bought in England....not the States.
B004JRVQX0|4.0|Love the compactness of the new iLok....and since the upcoming release of ProTools 11 is working with this version...I'm totally in sync with what they are doing now...the iLok website has even revamped their license software...very cool....giving it a B+...for now...
B002C949KE|4.0|This book provided quite an entertaining presentation of some of the authors studies within behavioral economics/game theory.  Each chapter breaks down an every day behavior and investigates our reasoning behind various decisions.  I left with many explanations of why I sometimes do illogical things and why others do things that, as an outsider, seem irrational to me.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who works within sales or real estate.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had immediate identification with the main character and could share her emotions throughout her trials.  Some ot the trials were a bit preposterous, but still engrossing. A great exercise for the imagination.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|A very interesting read.  Would suggest this book to others interested in life in North Korea. Shameful that the world allows this in the 21st  century.
B006IYG5HE|2.0|Too hard to keep track of all the characters.  Probably a necessary step for the story yet to come. Next book will tell.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Good story, and I like the main character in the book.  I'd read another by this author more than likely!
B000AOEMXM|5.0|To bad if was only 5 seasons. Would like to see it continue. All actors were did a excellent job.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|The dark theme is great and the show is pretty well acted. Will this be back or is this the only season of the show?
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great read. Very entertaining could not put the book down. Excited to read the next two books and see what happens.
B00CFA227C|4.0|I almost passed on this movie because I thought it might be too childish. I must say I was very pleasantly surprised that it's actually quite a good movie. It's definitely a fresh take on Jack and the beanstalk. It's definitely worth giving it a try. I have reached a point in life that I only complete about one out of every 10 movies that I start to watch. I'm glad to say this was the one in ten. I usually don't like it when movies change the basic story that I'm used to (such as hundreds of giants versus 1) but they actually pull it off very nicely in this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|He loves it. Tried to teach me how to play. I'm too slow according to him. Great for learning speed and dextertiy
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great actors, great acting. Awesome story! My 16 year old loves this movie. It is funny, sad, serious and great for the whole family. We all loved it!
B0024F08RO|2.0|The plots, and twists are absolutely absurd. If you enjoy shows that drag on, repetitive plots, and predictable twist outcomes, you'll love prison break.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game was challenging and fun however,  it would be better if it were longer. It was so short I finished it in about an hour.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I download it from Amazon app and installing was done automatic.<br />I love reading my Bible with various translations making it very interesting<br />to understand in modern English.
0316017930|5.0|Outstanding book<br />I gave it out as a present to all medical students who would be joinig a pediatric residency ths year.
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|I bought this album for the song never gonna be alone for my wedding and I absolutely love the whole album!
B009NG1Q96|2.0|If I had a hard copy of this book I would of crumpled it up by now. Does this author enjoy/trying to write bad endings or does she actually think we love reading through these torturous... woah there.<br /><br />Ok ok ok, I'm getting a bit too ahead of myself.<br /><br />I think that besides the endings (which I clearly detest) of both book 1 and 2, the only other thing that bothers me is the lack of any structural plot development. When I finished reading the book I felt like I had been robbed of my time.<br /><br />This storyline has such great potential but NOTHING happens in these books. I get it and... you know what, I don't. I don't get it. Yes all these YA books have love stories but they are also intertwined with a bigger plot. Let's bring in Divergent. Yes we have a relationship (Four and Tris) but we also have this whole rebellion, a bigger picture to a petty relationship that is NOT the central theme to the story. Yes I enjoy reading the romance but I also love that it is not its focal theme.<br /><br />This story would have benefitted with combining both book 1 and 2 because in all honesty, nothing happend. And I thought this was impossible but I found that we lost character depth with America. I could see her becoming a heroine, at the early stages at least, at the end of book 1 but it all went down the drain in this book. Her jealousy over both Maxon and Aspen was annoying. I don't think America realizes that there are other girls competing for Maxon's love/crown and that he can't shy away from their affections. If you're so bloody jealous why not accept his proposal and be done with the competition?! She became exactly like the girls she detested in The Selection which makes me really sad.<br /><br />She is also a bit of a hypocrite actually, kissing Aspen in the dead of night and expecting Maxon not do the same with other girls. [SPOILER]It was annoying how in one scene America had just seen her best friend punished and get her hands whipped to a bloody pulp for having an intimate relationship with a palace guard and what does America do the next day? Go on a date with a palace guard. Really?!  [END OF SPOILER] I guess you can say I have my fair bit of problems with America (pun intended).<br /><br />I was half hoping that we'd get a climax in The Elite (which we were deprived of in The Selection). Anything! Please! The rebels come in at the dead of night and take America, or Maxon, or anyone for that matter. The biggest 'climax' (if you can even call it one) was [SPOILER] America presenting her \\"caste-free\\" world to national t.v and finding out Maxon is a victim of his fathers brutality. [END OF SPOILER] But that's it. The story pretty much ends after that. The same abrupt ending as The Selection, except in this case I don't have the next book to keep me from venting out.<br /><br />I think this is definitely a book that you shouldn't really invest your time with. I'm not saying to skip reading it altogether, all I'm saying is to accept the flaws in the characters, plot, etc., and just go with the flow.<br /><br />What can I say, this is a Summer read after all.
0891419063|5.0|Not all Marines are created equal but the best always seem to rise to the top in seriuos situations, Thank God!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I did not expect this movie to be so good. I am NOT a zombie lover, but because of the commercials for this and the humor I saw I figured I would try it out. I am pleased with the dark humor and the story, and I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the game! I can't put it down once I start playing it. Want access to more rooms and hints in each room.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Love it!! Simple and fun! Excellent way to pass the time and enjoy the use of single and 2nd player!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Its a pretty cool game. Its not overly easy and cool story line.<br />It has lots of entry options and several clues on the way.
B00AFOS9C2|5.0|The music, the singers, the staging is wonderful. Jonas Kaufman is superb! Also, I love Wagner. I saw this production during a live transmission and this dvd does it justice.
B001TIIXQ0|5.0|Excellent book!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I like the fact that the percentage is easy to see.  You know about when to charge your Kindle.  I had a different one on my Kindle and I have to go into the app to see what was left on my Kindle.  Now with Battery Pro I can always see the remaining percentage.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I saw this app, and I needed a YouTube app. So I pushed the little button to download/install it. After installing it on the cloud it continued downloading...then there pops up a note, it was unable to download on my Kindle Fire. IT DOSNT WORK!
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Very clever game.  I play with my grandchildren and they are amazed at the correct answers.  We have a lot of fun with it.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Not as good as expected. Thought game would be more enjoyable. Seemed like this game took a long time to load.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game has addictive gameplay but can be frustrating at the same time.  I wish the levels had an ending or a least a multiplayer challenge option, such as &#34;I got this far on a level, how far can you get?&#34;
0670014893|3.0|I always have enjoyed LeCarre's books. However the underpinning premise of this book concerning \\"right wing evangelical Republicans\\" simply ruins it in today's times. Good God! Doesn't LeCarre read  or follow current events. Or is it mandatory to follow the liberal line in all things artsy. I think any terrorist today would rather the rendition of 2004 over the drone strike of 2013. And the kill list sitting on our dear leader's desk.
1455113549|1.0|Didn't get past chapter 5. At that point the story still hadn't gotten off the ground. It was almost painful!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is reminiscent of Galaga. One of my old favorites.<br />Very good controls too. There are several levels and three degrees of difficulty. You're gonna love it like I do.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great story line and great acting.  Vert happy I own this movie.  Highly recommend you add this to your DVD library.
B000PVAFT0|2.0|Watched this as an instant video so was not 3D. The Movie seems to be composed of clips of other IMAX movies thrown together with very loosely connected ties... Was the theme symbiotic relationships, predator and prey, or saving the coral reefs? Who knows? The narration is disjointed (2 narrators) and flat i.e. johnny depp discusses the creature of nightmares....the squid&#34; in such a complete deadpan that if it wasn't so boring it might have actually been funny. This was probably the worst imax i have seen although on a positive note, I think I will get a good nights sleep. Yawn.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I read the book a while ago and I was a little nervous about watching the movie.  I was not disappointed the special effects were amazing.  Took me on this journey again and it was unbelievable.  Well worth the money to own will be a classic.
B007REV4YI|2.0|disc did not work. skips and then totally stops. you really do get what you pay for i certainly did.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|Very difficult to put this one down to get other things done! Would really like to see more levels though and maybe a few more diverse surroundings.
B00821OX98|3.0|I hated to see the VP get shot. Would like added humor and less sex. The plot is very similar to Defiance which I try to watch but Defiance has even more offensive material than this.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I bought the more-expensive Sony MDR-XD100 Stereo Headphones (they're over-the-head, over-the-ear headphones), before buying these. The W08L's sound a billion times better than the more expensive, more serious-looking model. Get these!
B008602KQI|5.0|Love the movie, the characters are perfect. I especially love Josh Hutchinson. I am so looking forward to next movie.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|The chronicles have been great.  Looking forward to see where the story takes the Clifton's and the Barrington's in the next book.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Proof of Heaven is anything but proof. It is a neurosurgeon's account of supposedly having his brain destroyed until he was in a permanent vegetative state (yet, he recovers??), and while in a permanent coma, supposedly, because it turns out it isn't permanent (a miracle???), he has a near death experience. And he feels compelled to let us all in on this miracle, at a nice tidy sum for each book sold, of course.<br /><br />What's wrong with this book? Well for me it was:<br /><br />(1) Way too much info about his family and his illness. I learned more about the bacteria, E. Coli, than I ever wanted to know, and in minute detail!<br /><br />(2) His near death experience sounds very much like a standard flying dream in many ways, and that's what it probably was, just all a dream. Even the sudden shifts in setting, etc., seem to point to this. He probably had the dream just before he woke up, so that's why he remembers it, and I doubt it was more than a few seconds long, and not the full week in length his coma and he would suggest it was.<br /><br />(3) It just isn't \\"proof\\" at all, let alone \\"scientific proof.\\" What, because he is a doctor his subjective dreams are more real than those other patients who dream while in a coma? Come on!<br /><br />(4)The book is far more about his illness and his family than about his NDE. And as with all such books, all the information he gets seems \\"vague, yet clear,\\" \\"immediately there in his mind, and yet hard to extract to explain to us,\\" etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />(5) Finally, I suspect this book simply because they charge so much for it, are making so much money off it it and such. If someone really had such an NDE and it was real, would money, earthly possessions, matter to such a degree anymore? I think not. I think they'd want to share what they know for free, and Amazon does have free books available. Why would rank capitalism be so important still, to someone who had such a life (and death) altering experience? Let's be honest, it wouldn't be important, any more than it was supposed to have been for Jesus, Mother Theresa, Ghandi, or anyone else who truly followed the meaning and Word of God. They didn't charge for revelations or service. It was free! Joan of Arc didn't charge for her revelations, she died for them!<br /><br />(6) My recommendation? If you aren't the \\"needy\\" sort, and not one of those who just \\"has to believe,\\" than this book won't hold water for you. It's more of the same old, same old, and nothing more. It contains no \\"proof\\" whatsoever, but I bet that helps sell copies to have it in the title like that.<br /><br />I give this one star out of five and only because I have to give it at least one. Where is Houdini these day, exposing this sort of stuff for what it really is? I'm not saying the author didn't experience what he said he did, but I'm saying it certainly isn't \\"proof,\\" scientific or otherwise and was far more likely just a dream! But then, the needy who want to believe, undoubtedly will. Why be bothered with facts in such an instance, right? Or real \\"proof\\" as this book claims to have, but doesn't.onest, it wouldn't be important, any more than it was supposed to have been for Jesus, Mother Theresa, Ghandi, or anyone else who truly followed the meaning and Word of God.

B00AFEXRME|5.0|I love Denzel Washington and this movie was very good.  I would reccommend to others.  Denzel is one of my favorite actors and I would go and see or purchase his DVD anytime.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|The 2 disc combo was great. we are able to use it in our OLD dvd player as well as the Blu-ray player.  Haven't used the ultraviolet dc yet.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|i am hooked on the series and cant wait for the new one to start in the fall. just love it!
0316228532|5.0|The Casual Vacancy is the first book I read after finishing the Harry Potter series. And I must say this book is not a disappointment from such a talented author. Any adult can closely identify with the very real personalities in this book. I saw a lot of my younger self in Andrew Price and enjoyed the sinister dynamic among the citizens of Pagford and Yarvil. Reviewers calling this book a failure for its too many characters or crude language have failed to recognize a truly splendid novel. The Casual Vacancy is about the realness of life and the darkness that touches everyone regardless of wealth/gender/age/etc. Rowling still has her magic touch.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Anker has outdone themselves, they have created a true gaming product, while other companies use elaborate gimmicks to sell overpriced higher end products to gamers , Anker has created something that is both affordable and impressive. The LED light display is attractive and easily customizable  , it took me all of one hour to familiarize myself with this mouse and then jump right into my competitive games, easily switching DPI for accuracy as well as recording macros for micro. I play High elo league of legends, as well as Osu!, both of which require extensive muscle memory and dexterity with the mouse, and with this mouse I feel empowered within these games, almost as if I am working with an advantage. I would highly recommend this product, and I speak from experience having purchased both a Logitech g400 and a Razer Death Adder, This is buy far the best mouse I have ever owned. I look forward to future products from Anker and am thoroughly impressed.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved Downton Abby and this season 3 was excellent. I would highly recommend it! There are so many twists and turns, it was great.
B0010HA68I|4.0|Bought these for my hiking treks with my D7000. So far they are holding up to the weight of the camera and long lenses. Easy to attach to the webbing on back-pack shoulder straps; wouldn't recommend attaching to the D rings as the clips are a bit narrow. As for the clips, they are strong and easy to attach but difficult to remove if you switch your back packs often, which I also wouldn't recommend as I can see the clips wearing and eventually failing over time with on again/off again use.If you plan on  attaching these to one back pack, by all means get these; set 'em and forget 'em. Otherwise purchase another set or two for other back packs you may own. Nice sturdy web construction, stitching is on point. easy to adjust with no slipping. Highly recommend. Four stars for the difficult removal of the clips if you don't have strong fingers to do so.
1878424319|2.0|i was really excited when i bought this book, but it wasn't as good as i thought, it was very cheesy and honestly very boring. wouldn't recommend it
0553386816|5.0|I loved every page of the book it was great like all of  Grisham's books. cannot wait to read the next one!!!
B008YZ4RR0|4.0|Another continuation of Jesse Stone. A top cop in a small town.  Simple story line but enjoyable.  I wish there were more of them.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Just as I expected. Just like the tv show and the videogame and the novel and the other videogame and the other novel and the Facebook game and the mini series all just amazingly written and flawlessly executed. Pure perfection
0316228532|1.0|How do you say it's well-written, but horrid? I just did not get into it. It starts off interesting, but a few chapters in, it goes downhill. I have not been so glad to finish a book in a long time and almost gave up several times, but the reader in me won't let me.
0763644765|5.0|She loves this book!  You do have to make up some of the story behind it - like why doggie is using the tree, but she loves the animals and the little baby.  We are not potty training at this time, just starting to get some practice but it seems like a good tool to help her get used to the idea.
B00333NCTM|4.0|This book is a fantastic read! It's amazing that Ozzy was able to deliver all of these stories so vividly (considering the amount of drugs and alcohol he was on during the better part of his life).<br /><br />The book gives great detail into every aspect of his life, personal and professional; which is exactly what I was hoping for. It is a rock star memoir, that's for sure. It is 100% laugh out loud funny!!!<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it four stars it due to the fact that while he does give great detail about his Sabbath band mates, and Randy Rhodes... but he covers very little on Zakk Wylde, who was with him longer than any other guitar player. He doesn't tell how they found Zakk, and he doesn't mention anything about their writing together, which I feel should've been included. But all in all it is a great book, and well worth a read!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good way to pass time... they update periodically, easy to play.... kinds fun too. challenging but not too yard that you get frustrated.
0345803507|5.0|GREAT TRILOGY! HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WANTING TO READ AN EXCITING, ADVENTUROUS EROTIC NOVEL. VERY TASTEFUL LOVE STORY WITH A TOUCH OF WILD.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wanted to see what all the hype was about with this book and I found out. Such a good story line and good read. It's a quick read, couldn't put it down I was so drawn in to the story.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Came in perfect condition and was shipped very quickly.  This movie / dvd was just as expected.  My neice will love it for her birthday gift.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|All great songs, catchy and has tons of relistening potential! This is one of the better albums to come out this year.
0345529057|5.0|I love this series.  I watched Seasons 1 and 2 on HBO before buying the books and am actually (for once) glad I saw it before I read it.  There are so many characters in this series that I found myself on Game of Thrones Wiki pulling up names so I could put a face to what I was reading and that helped me get through the first book and excited to read the next ones.  I am halfway through book 2.  These are close to 1000 page books and the paperbacks are light with a binding that allows to open them all the way up and be comfortable holding such a book.  The cardboard box that holds the 4 books is just that, light-weight cardboard that would not hold up to much wear and tear.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I loved the book and the movie was great too. It follows the book fairly well and on BluRay it looks fantastic. I understand that some people are waiting for the extended editions but this one is a must have for those of us who cannot wait! The Ultra Violent digital copy is basically useless, but other than that this is a nice deal.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Perhaps because it is a &#34;prequel,&#34; rather than a continuation, I was disappointed in this film.  It was well-done and stuck faithfully to the original story (for the most part).  But, I kept comparing it to The Lord Of The Rings.<br />Also, I had hoped it would include their adventures with Smaug, but that was saved for a later installment.  Perhaps if it had been included, this film would have had a more dramatic finish.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This escape game is good. It's not too hard, but not too easy either.  Good game to pass the time; great way not to get bored while waiting.
B00821P3DS|2.0|Typical Hollywood ... Unfortunately, we're not all 15 yrs. old.  I'm sure the weak minded masses will enjoy this type of television.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Fast paced. I enjoyed the character of Fee and the insight into training dogs what it takes to be on a search and rescue team.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|What the world needs is more themes like this one. I like the focus on caring and relating. Can't wait for the sequel.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My favorite book in the series! Guaranteed to leave you in your toes and have you guessing! I will definitely be reading this!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Enjoyed the book a lot.  Almost like a historical fiction, good story line. (More words required, but I don't have any more)
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|This is not a mystery nor does it have a surprise ending.  It flows nicely and is a good read but never reaches a  crescendo- decrescendo pattern.  You might consider it boring unless you are in the mood to read something that is not taxing.
1455519006|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!...It has a brilliant plot, and is brilliantly written! Very exciting, and a real page turner!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love having this available on my iPad.  It's a terrific resource for me when shopping or adding up those unwanted bills.  Love it
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|As soon as I saw this game I though it might be a sucky free game;BOY WAS I WRONG!It is great up until you run out of coins. When that happens you can see adds for other cool games.
B008OURHPY|5.0|This album is fantastic. It's reminiscent of Alana Davis. It's soulful and fun at the same time. I love the title track and lots of others as well!

B008EKMB82|5.0|It was a wonderful story with many real elements of Japanese culture and the experience of life in Japan. There were many interesting historical pieces woven in as well as a connection to the present &#34;time being&#34;.
B000001DQI|5.0|This was received in great time, great condition and I have been playing this in my car.  I used to own the album and loved this in the 70's.  Brings back great memories of my teenage years.. Love Elton John.  Has to be one of my favorite all time CDs of his!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I don't typically read much in the way of fantasy -- I guess partly because I really don't want to see someone else do another take on Tolkien. I'm glad to say that this book, in my opinion, didn't try to do that, but went off on its own interesting path. Definitely getting the next in the series. Fun, light summer reading.
B000001EGE|5.0|This CD arrived in great time and in great condition.  This is a wonderful CD, but any Elton John CD is suberb.  Cannot go wrong on any of his music.  Love it.

0443069522|5.0|this book is fantastic.  the illustrations are phenomenal and the text and descriptions are simple and easy to follow.  My only anatomy class up until this point was one semester of basic anatomy in high school and gray' anatomy for students makes it seem like i've been studying it for years!  If your just beginning your anatomy studies or simply refreshing you prior knowledge this book is for you...it catches you up to speed no problems.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I appreciated author's candor, and honesty. I even found some of the medical/technical info interesting - even if you skip that part it's still has a lot to offer. It in no way 'sells' religion. Gives you lots of food for thought.
B0015RFCZ0|1.0|August Rush should come with a warning: you may contract diabetes from watching this movie. What a load of romantic cliches and completely irrational crap! Movies like this perpetuate the myth that a one night stand whom you never see again is really your One True Love and if you find each other again, it will be happily ever after all the way. Yeah, right. I'd like to see this couple in five years when her habit of alphabetizing the canned goods is driving him nuts, and his leaving the toilet seat up is making her crazy.<br /><br />Leave your common sense at the door if your going to watch this, because you'll be asked to believe that a healthy white male baby wouldn't immediately be fought over by multiple families who want to adopt him, but would instead be placed in some mythical home for orphan boys, which hasn't existed since Oliver Twist, that a hospital system would allow a child to be given up by the mother with just a signature, and not a lengthy conversation about why she doesn't want to keep her baby, and that a grown crazy man is housing multiple street urchins who stay with him voluntarily. You'll also be asked to believe (spoiler alert - as if anyone with more than two brain cells can't figure it out from the beginning) that two people who met once will find each other, and their long-lost son eleven years later in a city of millions of people without much trouble at all. The breathless dialog and faux angst between and among characters is nauseating. Avoid this movie like the plague or you may drop a few dozen IQ points in just over an hour.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game actually actually made my brain work.  although a few levels made me frustrated, but i stuck with it and passed the 8 levels......how soon before the next levels come.....
0812982622|3.0|First question: does Adam Johnson's novel deserve the Pulitzer Prize? Emphatically yes. It is a brilliant piece of writing, conjuring such influences as Kafka and Orwell, and perhaps a little David Foster Wallace, while yet being entirely unique, creating a genre like nothing I have ever seen before. It is based in grim reality yet utterly unreal in texture. It is extremely funny in parts, yet repulsive in its callous brutality. So my second question: did I enjoy it? Almost equally emphatically, no. In fact, fifty pages in, I called to cancel it as my selection for an upcoming book club. All the same, I was intrigued enough to read on to the end, with increasing interest but very little empathy or pleasure.<br /><br />The question is one of reality. Did I know nothing of North Korea (and few of us know much), I would have taken the picture of the propaganda-driven police state with its strutting figure of the Dear Leader as an entirely invented world that would not have been out of place in an episode of Star Wars. I now discover, however, that Johnson researched the subject extensively, interviewing defectors, reading the official newspaper, and eventually visiting the country; virtually everything is based on fact. Yet it reads like a fable -- for two reasons, I think. The first is because this is a country that lives on the fables it tells about itself; the book is punctuated by daily loudspeaker broadcasts about the wisdom of Kim Jong Il, and the sacrifices of the glorious heroes of the revolution. The second is the almost comedic way Johnson chooses to tell it, which may aim to explode the fable but actually reinforces it.<br /><br />The novel is divided into two parts: \\"The Biography of Jun Do\\" (170 pages) and \\"The Confessions of Commander Ga\\" (270 pages). The first part is the coming-of-age story of Jun Do, literally a John Doe, an Everyman -- or given the North Korean attitude to orphans, a Nobody. He is assigned the worst duties in his military service, but survives and is sent to language school to learn English, becoming a radio operator on a fishing vessel. Although relentlesly grim (there was one episode involving harvesting shark fins that almost made me throw up), the narrative here is pretty straightforward. I found it hard to care for Jun Do, but at least his story was clear.<br /><br />At the end of this section, however, there is a marvelous episode where Jun Do is sent to Texas with a delegation meeting a US Senator. They are entertained on a ranch with a program that starts with clearing brush with weed whackers and ends with a Texas barbecue, before Jun Do is shown to a bedroom with the family dog asleep on the bed. When their own plans fail, the delegates report back to the Dear Leader that they were systematically insulted by being forced to do manual labor, eat without utensils in the back yard like animals, and sleep with the dogs. It is funny, but also says something real about both cultures. I think the reason it worked so well for me was that I had a point of reference. North Korea may be a closed world, but America isn't, and I suddenly saw how baffled some of those foreign dignitaries must have been to be entertained by President Bush on his ranch near Crawford.<br /><br />With the longer second part, however, points of reference largely disappear. The ostensible protagonist now is Commander Ga, national taekwondo champion, husband of the national film star Sun Moon, and the man who rid the army of homosexuals. Different kinds of chapters follow in almost random order: some with the real Commander Ga, some aparently featuring Jun Do who has somehow taken his place, some narrated by an interrogator in the torture cells, and some the political broadcasts which tell a highly colored version of the story of Commander Ga and Sun Moon for propaganda purposes. It eventually becomes clear that the chapters jump back and forth in time too. It is as though the author is highlighting the artifice of the story. The gritty realism of the first part is entirely gone; the last two-thirds seems to come from some warped Korean version of the Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />Rather surprisingly, I did respond to a few moments of genuine tenderness between the impostor Ga and the actress, and there is some sense of moral growth as the end approaches. But these characters are not real. I cannot understand why the author did so much research into the real North Korea, only to treat it like the thinnest of pulp fiction. He might respond that North Korea IS pulp fiction writ large. But without some points of reference that I can recognize, without three-dimensional characters in believable situations, I simply don't care.ry.

B00CATSONE|3.0|Although interesting, the book was not as in depth as I would have liked. The book is a quick read with high and low lights of Nikola's life.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|This app was a great experience for me but it does get very old and boring after a while. The levels get harder and its not that fun anymore. Otherwise it's a great time waster, and gives you something to do.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use a Weather Channel app on my iPhone and I like the one on the Kindle even better. It's crystal clear, fast at updating and does its job.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I love the CD, and it arrived quickly, but the plastic disc that holds the CD in place (in it's holder,) was cracked. The CD does not stay securely in the holder when we put it away.That is the only disappointment.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|This first installment in the Batman movie series is solid, with a decent (not great) plot, and with stellar performances by Keaton, Nicholson, Basinger, and Wuhl. A lot of people will say that the Joker stole Batman's thunder in this movie, and I believe that's true to an extent. The good thing is that we get Batman, but also Bruce Wayne. Michael Keaton plays the role of Wayne to perfection; he's a very complex and deep person with a lot of flaws, despite his incredible wealth and charisma. Keaton makes this more than just a film about the Joker and Batman fighting; he brings a freshness to the movie to offset the 'criminal' mentality that's depicted throughout the film. Tim Burton did a good job in this film, though he didn't have complete control over its production. The next movie (Batman Returns) is more his style, and a better movie than this one. Still, this movie is a memorable experience with lots of good one-liners, mostly courtesy of the Joker. 8/10
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Great game but crashes about half the time in multiplayer. That is the only reason I give it average ratings.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|How can you adequately follow up to the greatest hip hop album in music history? Well, you can't. Kanye West got subsequently worse after My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, with his Jay-Z collaboration Watch The Throne being more back to the roots, yet still awesome and his record's group album Cruel Summer being not much more than well-made fun for the summer with tons of prominent guests on it. His newest release Yeezus is anything but spectacular - just look at its cover. And if West's Saturday Night Live performance of `New Slaves' and `Black Skinhead' induced you to think that his much anticipated 6th studio album is completely different to his former releases, it's not either.<br /><br />He was clearly experimenting with beats when he made the album and some Daft Punk productions are quite unique in hip hop, admittedly; but his rap style, which is the topmost in a hip hop album, has stayed very similar to earlier releases. What is it then that still makes it a great album? It's actually the fact that it isn't anything new. The Chicago rapper mixes every single one of styles he had in his rap career into this album, meaning The College Dropout's and Late Registration's pun- and wordplay-laden lyrics, 808's & Heartbreak whining, poetic lyrics and Autotune effects, and MBDTF's epic atmosphere. And seriously, there isn't anything bad with that because there's something for everyone included in Yeezus: However, a bit more uniqueness wouldn't have derogated the record, that's for sure.<br /><br />Basically, the album may be disappointing just because it isn't as colossal as `Ye's former  albums, but doesn't lack anything that would make it a great hip hop record. It should seamlessly fit in in your Yeezy CD collection at home and even if it may take some listens to get accustomed to it, you will like it eventually. Yeezus is an original, unconventional, and adventurous hip hop album like you've never seen one before. He tries a lot of new things with his music and although he doesn't succeed every time, it's great fun to listen to his musical mixture of feelings. Just think of the majestic beats and Justin Vernon's grand guest parts - how can you not love that?
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Really well written, acted, and intense TV show.  Looking forward to the next season.  Keeps you on edge between episodes.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This CD is a birthday gift for my son.  I have not given it to him yet, but it was on his birthday list.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Interesting story line and good script.  Affeck is pretty good in the movie and direction is really solid.  Not surprised it won Best Picture...just below a great film.
B000002GB2|5.0|This item was a surprise birthday gift to my son, and he was surprise and happy to receive the CD..
B00498YZFK|5.0|Really good drama with strong story line and great acting.  J. Lawrence is fantastic and other key members are perfect.  It has a good tempo through out the movie that works well with the story.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|My two sons and their sons are big Ozzy fans, so I am sure they will be happy to receive them.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I have had this app for about 9 months. All was well until a recent storm went through and the information either did not update or did not work. I fixed the problem by downloading NOAA. Everything works great.
B000OP1M6M|3.0|Out of the box it ran about five minutes fast per week.  After about 15 good months, it went crazy.  First, it just stopped going so I let it rest then put it on again.  Then, it running about 10x's too fast.  I sent it Seiko in New Jersey and they sent me a quote for $125 to fix it...but then they realized it was under warranty and fixed it.  Then, it broke down four years later and I haven't tried to get it fixed yet.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Very creative beats, lyrical, raps about real life shit. I would have to say this album is better than Yeezus
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  I thought it was so much better than the movie.  It really changed my perspective on mental illness and I highly encourage others to read it.  Fascinating, funny, insightful, and romantic all in one book!
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Most songs on this album sound alike. Very creative album though! Bound 2 is by far the best song on the album. Still an album to purchase
0143120530|5.0|Great story about how the hunter becomes the prey<br />Very well written and even includes some good vocabulary words<br />See page 248
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The puzzles are great had several head scratching moments. Challenging but not overly so. Thoroughly enjoyed doing them, look forward to more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Dear Mojang, in the next update can you make it were you can change your game mode and give us all the items along with villages. Thanks Mojang
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Our kids got us interested in these guys by watching their youtube video of 'mission impossible' they are fun to listen to and watch. They have covered a lot of popular tunes as well. Take the time and go to youtube to see even more of their music videos, they're awesome.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Purchased this for my sister who is a Rod Stewart fan. She loves this Cd and listens to it as often as her husband watches ball games.
B0007939NO|5.0|Have always been a fan of Brigadoon. Gene Kelly & Cyd Charisse work together well in this movie. Glad to finally have it on DVD so I can get rid of my VHS tape.
0679805273|5.0|This book is great for Kindergartners as well as high school or college graduates. One of my creative writing students plans to read or quote from this book at her high school graduation.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Saw Lindsey Stirling in a Piano Guys video. Wow is she ever awesome. She puts her own spin on known songs as well as having quite a few original numbers. I have 4 kids that play the violin and they all love the effort and awesomeness of Lindsey's playing. Take a few minutes and go to youtube to look at her music videos. It's amazing to see the energy & creativeness she puts into her playing!
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|I just finished listening to the album, and a lot of it is lol. He made me laugh when he said 'I speak swag=hili\\". I was hoping the album had more substance to it. He mostly brags about \\"bitches\\" and riches. If I wanted to hear that from him, I would have bought a JayZ cd. The beats are definitely on some next level strange ish, so I can respect the production. I also found it interesting that \\"I Am A God\\" received complaints based on the title alone. He basically said a lot of the things that other rappers would say, and being a celebrity will give a person a god complex. Why is it that when Kanye says it, all of a sudden, he's a spoiled douchebag? People are definitely playing favorites when it comes to Kanye in general. I was hoping for his album to be something you sit down and give it your undivided attention to. I wanted this album to have depth and substance. Some of it does (3 songs) but the rest doesn't do it for me. Maybe it's because there are too many bitches and p*ssies sprinkled throughout the album. It gives me the idea that he may be over compensating a bit. I'm glad I streamed it first.  Here's a brief breakdown of the tracks:<br /><br />On Site:  That was weird, however the lyrics were decent. I enjoyed the beat transition. It was a very unique experience, to say the least. I'm definitely not used to listening to such a bizarre beat.<br /><br />Black Skinhead- I like it! Kanye definitely changed the game with this one. I love the message. Great energy.<br /><br />I am a God- I tried to listen to this track while erasing any and all opinions I've heard pertaining to the title. The content of this song is similar to what a lot of other rappers have said. They brag about their stuff and being entitled. Kanye did it here, and people shut down. Jay Z has made his living off of rubbing his riches in every bodies faces. Many celebrities do this so Why does Kanye get dubbed as \\"entitled\\" and spoiled? It was pretty generic for what one would think a rapperis supposed to rap about.<br /><br />New Slaves- I heard this first when he was broadcasting the videos across the country.  I loved it then, and I still love it now, however the auto tune gets in the way. That gets remedied when the sample at the end starts up, so there isn't much of a loss there.<br /><br />Hold My Liquor feat. Chief Keef and Justin Vernon- This track was tedious for me, not because Chief Keef was on it but I just couldn't get into it.<br /><br />I'm in it: Another track where sex was the main topic. However I like the reggae influence and the singing. The 3rd verse was dope \\"I be speakin' swaghili\\"! Love that!<br /><br />Blood On The Leaves- I was hoping this track would have been a bit more in depth. It sounds like it's a track about a failed relationship. another spin is in order.<br /><br />Guilt Trip Feat.Kid Cudi- Unfortunately, I lost attention on this so I can't really comment.<br /><br />Send it up-This track doesn't have much substance. It's more of a story about going to the club. The \\"memories\\" part made me laugh!<br /><br />Bound 2 feat Charlie Wilson- This started up as promising. I love the sample. the lyrics not so much.<br /><br /> I usually listen to an album at least 3 times before I decide to give it a review. I listen to it in my car, with headphones at my computer and in my Ipod. Sadly, I checked this album out on my computer, and I can't even give myself the chance to listen to it in my car or in my Ipod.<br /><br />All in all, this may be some next level swag music.  To be honest, I didn't even like this level's swag music, so, there's that.<br /><br />I want to rate this album higher, I really do. Unfortunately I can't. I'm going to have to give it 3 stars, and that's mostly for the production. I would have appreciated it better if it were an instrumental album.  His lyrics are a 2 at best.<br /><br />Stand out tracks are On Site, Black Skinhead and New Slaves.
0399226907|5.0|According to my seven month old, this book is the *absolute height* of good literature. IT follows the caterpillar's trials and tribulations from his emergence from his formerly moon-lit egg as a young, naive soul through the waxing and waning of his appetite, and his personal evolution as he sees the error of his gluttonous ways, without ever loosing sight of his epic quest for food. It's 14 pages of suspense, and the payoff is amazing. It also, I am assured, has a very chewy spine.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|This is a real sleeper and Maggie Smith is delightful. It reminds me of the Alec Guiness  version of Lady Killers.<br />Its well worth the time and cost.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|I hoped for a better game. I found it to be alot of hurry up and wait kind of game. It would be ok for an 8 year old.
B009POHHR6|5.0|This is without a doubt in my mind the single greatest comic book ever written. Completely unprecedented. Will blow everybody's mind.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I have recommended this series to many of my friends. It isn't for every one...but I'm sure looking forward to seeing season 3.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game not enough levels... I had fun with my guy playing this glad it was for free lol would be mad if paid for 8 levels
B0068PHS5Q|5.0|this is a beautiful, poetic and amazing book. A fantastic story that keeps you hooked all the way through. Highly recommend this to everyone
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Plays great bought as gift for older sibling, sibling wanted movie so I purchased it hope they liked it thumbs up
B0025UHKNS|5.0|It was just what they said it was and more! I am glad that I bought it was just what I was looking for.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I liked all of the books but this one was my favorite. I also liked the Kane chronicles they were funny.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Mr. Card really spoke to me in a time when I felt defeated. It was Ender who have me hope. Ever since I was a little girl I've wanted to be a writer and I never believed that I could but Mr. Card really restored my light and bequeathed me with a new set of confidence. Within this book the language spoke to me. I saw and felt every word he wrote. I was Ender. And that is what a talented writer does. He also forced me to see things in Ender that were in me. This book has been an incredible journey that Ender and myself went on and its one of the only books that I've experienced instead of read. Thank you Mr. Card you have done more than you'll ever know.
0061950726|5.0|The book was very interesting and anyone who didn't know about the orphan trains should read it. I knew there were trains that brought orphans to the mid west from the east coast but this book showed how some were used and abused. I thought it was interesting how Kline interwove the two stories into one. A must read. Jennifer Bell
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does it again!  Great story that kept me guessing until the very end.  Cannot wait for his next book.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has done it again! I loved her latest book. It was such a fun summer read, light and amusing and written in her usual humorous style. Well worth both the time and the money spent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love it this one is so much better and easy to upgrade I like the railroad so much it is easier to play too
B00AL1ONN8|1.0|I bought a t.i. album (trouble man) and only got 11 tracks out of 16 don't know how or why it happen need it rectified.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Brandon Sanderson finished this series really well!  Thank you!  Very awesome read, I would definitely recommend this book.  I am going to wait patiently for more of his books!
B00009YOQW|5.0|Realized my toddler was still playing with many baby toys so I slowly started to upgrade. Even at 17 months she gets a hoot out of this drum set. This is my go to &#34;distraction&#34; toy, to transition her from crying or getting into trouble to playing with her own toys. I just start hitting the drum and she comes running. Should serve her well for a long time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great app. I love it so much. I can't wait for more rooms to be added soon.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game, but I just wish there were more levels to start before having to wait on an update. Overall great game though
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Glad I didn't go to the theater for this one. Decent rental. Felt rushed from the start. Certainly not a blockbuster by any means.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. Not just plant and harvest. Battles, races, flying games, army building....<br />All resources build up at a pretty good rate and levels up quickly, not to mention the beautiful graphics and all the epic characters. Love this game.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|It was as good as the first book.  I couldn't put it down.  I look forward to the other books in this series.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Thrilling movie with an unexpected plot twist.  I watched this film twice as it is free for Prime members - enjoyed it each time.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The 7.1 works well even though I don't have many things that utilize the 7.1 Surround Sound. The Battery Life seems to last for around 8 - 10 hours on a full charge for me but can be plugged in and used as a Wired Headset if it needs recharging. My Package didn't come with a software CD but I was able to download it for free off the logitech website. As for range it can go throughout the tiny home I live in.
B0018OASZE|3.0|We collect vinyl. There's nothing like listening to music on a record player.  Love Adele's music, but the record came a little bit misshapen. It can actually be heard in one of the songs. Maybe find a different seller? Or be more diligent about returning things than I am.  Comes with a digital download, so at least I have the mp3s
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Not just the best vg movie, but also in my top 10. I could watch this many times to see the many references to other video games and other 80s/90s culture that really mattered (M. Jackson, Kurt Cobain, etc. were always distant figures compared to these influences in vgames!)
0756407125|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read -- better than the first, and that is saying something.  I look forward to the next book in this series.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I found &#34;House of Cards&#34; compelling to watch and think Kevin Spacey is excellent. Sophisticated yet easy to follow especially if you love politics
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I can't go to sleep without music and since Pandora started limiting the # of streaming music, this has been my go-to. I'm grateful for the lovely way transition to sweet dreams...
1593974744|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations I was very satisfied with the book and their was some very funny parts also
B00AB55BS0|5.0|The Game of Thrones complete first season is an extremely well put together series. It's definitely something i'd refer my friends too who like action and adventure. I'd also like to note for parents out there that it isn't a series for children.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book helped me to understand what makes an introvert tick and that many of the great contributions to the evolution of human society are courtesy of introverts.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is easy to install, use and look at.  There were no problems downloading, nor using.  It looks simple and intuitive and works easily. I have it at the beginning of my carousel and every time I have to charge.  I am a heavy user lately.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|The craftsmanship of Studio Ghibli is beyond compare. Theirs are the only movies I am willing to watch without knowing anything about them.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|this is a great DVD movie and it is good deal to have it. Anyone must have this movie for a good collection from a powerful performance of Angelina Jolie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not too bad its good for making you think. wish it had more levels though. definitely something I could keep playing
B004XANKVO|4.0|Very good backpack, good materials and workmanship.<br />It is just a little bigger than I expected - the only matter I rated it 4.
B000JMKNZQ|4.0|It was definitely a good read as if he was in my head seeing the questions many of us struggle with everyday. We make many mistakes throughout our lives our choices are to learn from them or keep reliving them. I believe that's the difference in finding the path to enlightenment and stumbling around in the darkness. This is the third book I have read of Paulo Coehlo's and hope to read many more as his insight brings clarity to many unanswered questions.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|need more game's... should do some hits time to time.. tolled me 30 mins to get them all done in one day...
B00DF0POXA|5.0|I had been nervous that issues/situations of his personal life were starting to effect the quality of his work in a negative away. While being a huge fan of all his solo albums I was let down by Watch the Throne and did not like Cruel Summer at all. When this album first leaked my first feeling I experienced was relief. Kanye is back and as good as ever. With each album he is constantly changing his sound and pushing towards a new direction. Not too many can not only constantly reinvent their sound but do it so successfully each time. I think in that regards he is becoming similar to Radiohead. Love this album, kind of surprised by the mixed fan response, but I think if it doesn't work for you the first time. I'd give it a few more tries.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book I just got so in to it like I was living in the book I am get book to
0142403873|5.0|This is one of my favorite books to read with my 4 year old daughter. She also loves it and knows almost all the words. What a fun story! Our first Julie Donaldson book was \\"Where's my mom?\\" which is also excellent. In fact, we have most of her books and have enjoyed them all. Another favorite is \\"The Snail and the Whale\\".
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|perfect fathers day gift and birthday gift for my hubby. He was able to watch shows he had missed and didn't know it.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Kanye has always made references to MJ (Michael Jackson) but now that he thinks he is the God of Rap and Mike undeniably the King of Pop think about the statement he is making with the range displayed on this albumn.  Of course, what comes to mind for me is Thriller with only 9 tracks and maybe just maybe only 1 that you may skip (\\"The Lady in my Life\\"). Now with Yeezus we get only 10 and maybe 1 that you may skip (unknown right now). \\"Blood on the Leaves\\" is just plain Genius.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Great blog reader app. Very slick interface that is also very configurable. Highly recommended for all the ex-google reader people out there.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|A small-town con-man magician discovers that the world has only labelled him as such, and he finds true magic when circumstances push him to examine his true nature. A wonderful light hearted film with beautiful animation, a good cast, great acting, and best of all, a high quality story!
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|80-90% of this book focuses on science, so don't avoid it thinking it's going to be a bunch of hocus-pocus spiritual psycho-babble. I love that someone has put this information out there and is trying to pave the way to a new (correct) understanding of the connection between body, mind, and spirit. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is pretty science-heavy, which may discourage those without a basic understanding of biology. But try not to be intimidated by that - it has been well written (as plainly as possible) and will be well worth your time to read and learn and ultimately understand.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|this book is a real page turner. i was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyednthis book, considering that i had never heard of the author. the story is told very well and the plot twists are brilliant.
B009NY43NY|5.0|What is it about these books?  I just can't say how much fun they are.  I'll miss Skokie and her crazy life so much.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|[[ASIN:B008UCJ7KO Entwined with You (A CROSSFIRE NOVEL)]]This book is pathetic.  Raunchy with no story line.  I can't believe I actually waited for this third book to come out.  Bad attempt at trying to be like a \\"50 shades of Grey\\" trilogy.  The guy in this book is not even anyone that I would be interested in and the girl is trashy.  DUMB!!!
B00AU15HPC|2.0|...you will not like this CD. I think he is trying to be \\"country\\" (thus the title). However there are bonus tracks that are mixes and belong on a dance/club release. Guess they had to fill out the CD length.
B008G12ERC|2.0|There are some fun interesting songs on here, but most of it sounds like one long song going nowhere. Love these guys, just not this album.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|I love Maglite flashlights, but they have one major design flaw: they don't have on/off buttons.  This little kit changes everything, now I have a Maglite with all it's awesome durability AND a great long lasting bulb AND and on/off button.
B00BP4X7TG|4.0|It's funny and interesting. Slow paced. Quirky in a nice way. I enjoyed reading about the real people after watching this movie.
B0048L4VRA|5.0|I bought this for my 6 month old for the beach, and it's perfect!! I love how the bottom blows up so it's got a little cushion fore his tushy! and also how the top shade, is attached, that makes a huge difference also! Love love love! You can blow this up with your mouth also/
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I watched this over a two day period, and was glad I did because there are 6 story lines and you need to pay attention. Great visuals. Wonderful characters.
B000I8JEY2|2.0|Thought it will be funny, but you see the jokes coming from miles away.<br />Stopped watching it in the middle, since it was just boring and not very funny.
B00AXVH8KQ|5.0|love this album (as well as their others), can't wait to see foxygen perform live at solid sound music festival
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The only problem with this app is that there's only eight levels (for now) .  It's so much fun and I was disappointed when I finished it.  It's not overly difficult, but it's challenging enough to keep you interested.
B00CFSWMYM|3.0|Listened to this several times on NPR. Katie Stelmanis has a remarkable voice. She can make any song magical. Still, I'm saddened by the sameness of the material here. Perhaps the band paid too much attention to the process of creating the sounds live and not enough on the end result. I'll probably download two or three of the songs, but that's it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great app.  Fun and challenging way to kill time.  If you like hidden object games this will be right up your alley.
B00B2JOJIM|5.0|I've read reviews by some that assert that Heaven isn't representative of the album &#34;Delta Machine&#34;.  I disagree.  It's raw gospelly-bluesy sound is the very soul of Delta Machine.  A center, if you will, from which the other tracks radiate.  The deep richness of the bass guitar and piano and Dave Gahan's soul bearing vocals define the album as a whole... this one is a spiritual journey of introspection.  As always, they have pushed their own envelope, and come out with something that is an inspiring mix of the old and the new.  Rough, bluesy, soulful, gritty, seductive and absolutely delicious.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was great I loved it. can't wait till more levels come out. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|awesome game keeps you thinking when you move up in levels just needs more levels not just 8 but worth the time to play
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Fact or fiction...Isn't really important. This book is interesting as all of Brown's books are. I enjoyed this fast paced book, learned a lot more about some things that I had rudimentary knowledge and...can' wait to visit Washington DC with new eyes.
B008PWUTJC|4.0|I have a similar TImbuk2 sleeve for the Kindle keyboard device. I feel that product had more padding but was somehow sleeker. So in comparison, this product has less padding and is bulkier. It does its job so 4 stars it is.
B00002N9ER|3.0|It will do the job but isn't very sturdy for the heavy maglight.  I would find something else, to be honest I find costco flashlights better then the maglight too.  The only good thing about Maglight is you can hit somebody over the head if you need to defend youself.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|I loved this movie because it was a faithful &#34;prequel&#34; to the Wizard of Oz. It kept the same feel of the 1939 classic and it is suitable for the family, even though the wicked witch parts maybe scary for some children.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|you level 8 was the hardest. maybe level 5 too. it was difficult but you just have to look EVERYWHERE. Hint on level 8: there is a charger for the phone on the cuckoo clock. good luck!

B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Great movie if you love horror and just want to turn off your brain for a bit.  Doesn't hurt that all the ladies in this movie are spectacularly stunning.  Storyline goes some expected ways, but ends like you'd never suspect.  Not a bad movie at all!
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I love this app it is very usefull I don't like long workouts that take up your day the longest you will workout is 30 minutes
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Overall the movie is a great Romcom.  Has layer of plot that show how Bradley Coopers character became so twisted in his emotions.  Would have been nice to see as much story attributed to Jennifer Lawrence's character.  It's also a very contrived Hollywood story that goes just how you expect, everyone wins and no twists at all.
B0087ITBPC|4.0|They are a great team.  I look forward to more movies starring them.  It is like real life happenings. Keep up the good work.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is an awesome series and also sad. You get really in touch with the characters characters recommend this series yo everyone
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Great puzzle game.  One of the few that I've felt compelled to go back and get all the stars (and crowns) on every level.  Looks promising that they will release additional levels for free, just like they did for Cut the Rope series.  I wish that it had a 1-move-undo, rather than having to restart the whole level.
B0031R5K8G|5.0|It seems I am partial to stories narrated by children/ young adults as I loved Extremely Loud & Incredible Close and The Elephant Keeper's Children as much as I did this story.<br /><br />It is a quirky and captivating story and is firmly on my list of favourite reads.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|E2 is a great book full of cool experiments that you can practice on your own to prove the power of the law of attraction is alive and working in your life at all times.  The book is a great tool at helping you build your confidence in mastering your destiny and designing your life. Good Job!
B007QUUJMG|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower reminds me of a deeper, more 'serious' version of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole.<br />It's a coming of age story told by an awkward teenage boy (we read his journal type entries), but instead of very light hearted/ comical prose, The Perks of Being a Wallflower tackles things like homosexuality, loneliness, drugs, etc.<br />It feels quite raw at times and is certainly a moving tale.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is challenging but fun It makes you think but isn't so hard that you cant figure it out
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I didn't like the characters - they leave an almost bitter taste in your mouth, but I loved the story.<br />Gillian Flynn did a brilliant job - I was in suspense from chapter to chapter and almost wanted to race through to the end and reveal the truth!<br />I can't recall having read anything similar to Gone Girl before- it's unique style is deserved of all the attention the book has been receiving.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|It's a good idea to get some skills on this simulator before crushing down a real model. The landing of RC plane is no easy task. So I'm happy to get this app without any charges.<br />The graphics is nice and realistic. The control is not easy, as in real world. For my opinion it's an excellent application. Developers, thank you!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game!  you just have to look at everything for tools to help you get keys to escape out the elevator!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Running time approx. 97 min Sound 5.1 HD DTS, HD pic. This movie hits (0-60) right from the start! Non-stop balls to wall hardcore fighting reminiscent of Kill Bill, and Crouching Tiger, to include some very bloody hardcore UFC style fighting in this move. Heavy profanity and lots of blood gore and body parts! Love it! This movie rocks and has all of the ingredients of a damn good Kick-ass movie! This is the kind of high-end, well- made, A-list level, Blockbuster movie, you WILL watch again and again. Stunning make-up and wardrobe, superb sets and upper level (A-list) CGI effects. Stunning and very beautiful scenic cinematography through this movie. Trust me guys this movie (is) money well spent! I'm so proud of this movie. Buy it on Blu-ray and enjoy it. This movie will amaze you!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A good way to burn some time... I like the new vehicle choices.  Good game for the kids to play too. Over all a five star game for me.
B004LWZVZC|2.0|The Conspirator is a star studded period piece concerning the kangaroo court trial of those involved in the Lincoln assassination, specifically the rather thin case against Mary Surratt, played by the usually brilliant Robin Wright. Surratt's son was involved in Booth's numerous revenge plots. Mrs. Surratt owned the boarding house in which the conspirators often met. While there are a number of historical theories and interpretations, the film points out the unconstitutional manner in which the trial was conducted. Historical accuracy or inaccuracy is not my main point of analysis. While obvious characterizations are whole or partially fictitious, the circumstances, Surratt's guilt or innocence and the depth of the pro-Southern conspiracy, are open to historical debate. Therefore, this film is merely an interpretation. However, it is simply flat. Directed by Robert Redford and brimming with talent, it has no logical right to be as lifeless as it felt to me. I can't help but compare it to Spielberg's Lincoln, where political conversation and intrigue is gripping and evocative or Spielberg's earlier historical courtroom drama, Amistad. Compared to those films, the finely crafted sets, costuming, and casting of The Conspirator is dragged down by its lack of passion and its rather drab style. The subject matter is ripe for overblown melodrama or opportunities for taut historical commentary. The Conspirator lands disappointingly in the middle.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Its a sad thing that in 2013 faltering films use a lesbian scene to try and save a bad script and film.  It is really getting a little old.
B008OOYALE|2.0|I enjoyed playing this game on my Kindle Fire, but it rarely worked.  The game froze or booted me out so many times that I deleted it from my device in frustration.  I would recommend DragonVale instead.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|It's so much cheaper to get it in bunk like 10x5 than getting 10x2.. might as well get a bunch
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I can see it already, all the bible-thumping, holy-rollers and money-grubbing evangelist hypocritical right-wing fundamentalists all the way through the bible belt are in an uproar going through the roof, and rolling over in their graves over this one... \\"WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT, GOD IS DEAD??!!\\". And Ozzy will be laughing all the way to the bank.. (insane laughter) haaa-haaaa-haa-haaa-haa!!<br /><br />But notice he was clever enough to put that question mark there... :)  But they won't listen to the lyrics, all they're gonna hear is \\"GOD IS DEAD!\\", they will demand the radio stations ban it, sales of the album be stopped, and Ozzy be crucified. They will start calling him the Anti-Christ again, and the publicity will be the best thing that ever happened for his career since he bit the head off a bat, yeeaaah! Pure genius, only Ozzy could ever come up with a stunt like this.<br /><br />So that song alone is worth the price of the album, but the rest is awesome too, except I would have made one minor change. Instead of \\"Zeitgeist\\", the only weak song on the album, I would have substituted any one of the bonus tracks, my personal favorite would be the pulsing rocker \\"Peace of Mind\\". Other than that, this is near perfection, with \\"God is Dead?\\" destined to be their biggest hit since \\"Paranoid\\" or maybe bigger. WAY TO GO BOYS!!
B005ETANC2|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Another paranoid 50's classic!<br /><br />If you like 1950's giant insect movies (well, spiders are not insects, but close enough!), you'll love this classic from director extraordinaire, Jack Arnold - \\"Creature From The Black Lagoon,\\" \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man,\\" \\"It Came From Outer Space.\\" A lot of fun, & a giant Tarantula crawling over the desert, ready to make a meal out of you & all your neighbors!

B000FBJHZS|5.0|Great Dan Brown book! Keeps you entertained and on the edge of your seat. Even if you don't like the Robert Langdon books- like Da Vinci Code- you may like this because it's not really about history... its about a power struggle, lies and deception (haha) in present day America- between organizations you know and hear about all the time.<br /><br />READ!!!
B0055V6EZE|4.0|As Dr. Greg House on tv this guys a real jerk, but his music cd is actually really good if your into really high quality recordings and blues. His voice takes time to get used to but he sounds like no one else. I thought it would be more of a jazz album but it's not, very sparse instruments to muddy up a recording with. Before you buy this, listen to some of the tracks on youtube...
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved this book and how it kept me on the edge the entire time, could not put it down. Loved it!!!!
B00D8RYV52|2.0|Was not what i expected from a &#34;garage&#34;. More like a collision repair shop. I was expecting things like a flat tire and such. This was just placing ladders, lights, sirens etc on say, a fire truck. Compared to the other Dr Panda games this one was not fun. I play all the games before my granddaughter and she only likes the drive over the hills scenes.

B0041KKYEM|3.0|this movie was very good! i loved it. the case was like new and it all started off fine. then about 1/2-3/4 into the movie, there was a scene that i could not watch because it kept skipping. eventually i finished it and i did  not miss anything really important but at the same time it was a very suspenseful moment. overall, i enjoyed this movie
B005D6O0IO|4.0|I really like the shoe, but I wear a 71/2 and I purchased the 7 whereas that 1/2 would have made the purchase a perfect fit. I am pleased just the same and the price was good.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I relate to the artist in her choices of subject material and lyrics of expression, just a beautiful audio experience for an uplifting mood, a blend of styles from modern folk with a subdued dreamy tone. I would recommend this disk to anyone who enjoys to hear someone sing.
B0039NK0LE|5.0|I had this movie in my collection for 10 years and only saw part of it.  I recently watched it all and me and my bf laughed our butts off.  It's a classic toilet humour movie mainly for guys who are into cussing like a sailor on pay day and alot of gratuitous sex.  My fave scene is the dancing sequence at the gay bar, now that is entertainment.  I probably won't get into the other Pie movies, this one is enough. It's really the character Stifflers movie, Sean whatever his name is trips me out, I've grown to really like him, he's in another funny movie Evolution.  But this movie has alot of LOL parts that makes you laugh no matter what.
B000000993|5.0|This CD has a great affect on my mood and I  find it to be very entertaining and fun to sing along with.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I paint and ordered this book because of the title; however, this book is for anyone who wants to excell at what ever they do. It is easy to read, the author uses few words to get his point accross and it is one of those books I will go back to over and over again.
B001CDWFPC|1.0|I love my ESV bibles. I assumed that the study bible that you pay for would actually have decent navigation built in as my friends have shown me how simple it is to navigate the ESV study bible in iBooks, but the kindle version is horrible.  There is no way to easily get from one book to another. What is the point! I want my $4.99 back.  Without good navigation there is little point in having this Bible. I am extremely disappointed. It would be easier to carry around my hardcopy, or go to esvstudybible.org.  At least I can move from place to place faster.  Why even offer this product without good navigation. Makes me want to go back to NASB. ESV you need to consider the quality of product you are putting out.  I understand for a free version, but not one you pay for.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My grandchildren asked for this game and they love it. They are forever taking my kindle and playing it sometimes for hours before I take it away and make them go to bed.

B0058YPGSY|4.0|We were so disappointed to watch such a fabulous series, get all the way through to the final disk and it all lost clarity and went fuzzy. Stopped, started & skipped all the last 3 episodes.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|If you are a Kanye fan, you want this. With him it's just as much about the music and the mood he creates as it is about the lyrics. He is a constantly evolving artist and this really shows how no one else is doing what he's doing and trying to push rap out of the rut it's in. I like good mainstream hip hop, but it's also really good to hear something that's not predictable and catches you off guard. Really enjoy this. I do wish it was longer though. Not in a bad way, more like it left me wanting more because I liked it.
1616550414|5.0|A wonderful piece of art, and specially good for research and curiosty ones. Any who wants to know bettter about the mystical Hyrule world and hystoria shoud buy it, ou if you only like the arts of the game, it's a good choice too.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read!  The characters are so imperfectly perfect that they are nearly tangible!  I love the entire Crossfire Series and I think this book gives us the general overview about each character's personalities.  And who doesn't love Gideon?! :D<br />Recommended for anyone who loves dominant/controlling/rich/sexy male protagonists and romance!
B009MYAQK4|3.0|There are some interesting thoughts, but the situation is a bit hard to imagine.  Why would these religious leaders sit in the same room and listen to &#34;The Copt&#34;?  The story lacks background to understand why everyone is so deferential to &#34;The Copt&#34;.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Absolutely perfect, best of Day's Crossfire novels so far!  This book is incredibly romantic and I love Gideon now more than ever!

0439023521|4.0|** spoiler alert ** First off...SPOILERS are in this review. If you have not read the book, back out of this review now.<br /><br />The setting is in the far distant future, but it's mind-blowing to even think that humankind can become so callous and malevolent as to send twenty four children between the ages of twelve and seventeen to their deaths yearly. What has happened to make us this way?<br /><br />We don't really know. What we do know is that a large number of people--an entire District--were killed by the government, the Capitol, as an example of what could happen if you were to ever step out of line again. It's told to us that there were once thirteen of these districts, each with a different industry focused to provide goods for the Capitol. Supposedly, you can still see District 13 smoldering from the damage done. At least this is what our character and those of her kind have been led to believe. It's been more than 70 years since any of it happened so the details are sketchy at best.<br /><br />In the beginning, I felt sorry for Gale. The very hunky, every girl in District 12 seems to want him, boy who is Katniss' best friend. We learn very little of him, actually, we learn very little of any of them, but you can tell from their short interaction that he has developed feelings for her. She, of course, is oblivious. She seems to suffer from this affliction throughout the book in regard to any male affection. I digress.<br /><br />We learn quite a bit more--by comparison--about her \\"relationship\\" with Peeta. He's the quiet boy with the crush from a distance, who finally gets his chance to tell her how he feels, and he does it openly on a large stage. A grand gesture for sure, but of course Katniss is oblivious to this. Though at the direction of her sponsors, she winds up playing to the cameras during their time in the Arena and is rewarded for this.<br /><br />You realize right away that she is oblivious to Peeta's actual feelings and you feel sorry for the guy. Can anyone honestly say that if in Katniss' situation they wouldn't have suspected the same?<br /><br />There are ever so slight twists to the story. You truly learn very little about anyone but Katniss--it's first person point of view, so she'd be the one we unearth the most about.<br /><br />There is an amount of predictability to the storyline, but it's original in plot. If you don't pay attention to the tidbits of information given to you by Katniss throughout the book, you will miss the character development. There were only a few small grammatical errors, but once I hit page 57, I didn't want to put the book down for too long.the guy.

B000OYC3J8|4.0|I love most of the songs, but a few are a little out there, musically speaking.  I do like the Celtic/Scottish sounds in a couple of the songs.  And &#34;Cause and Effect&#34; is one of the best songs on there.

B00C5W3SBE|3.0|I must say that this movie was visually stunning, but the plot could have used another polish or two.  Of course, this movie is attempting to follow in some big shoes, as it is difficult to compete with the orginal classic that so many of us have grown up with and loved over the years.  Still, it is fascinating to return again to the Land of Oz and see more of it than ever before.<br /><br />Oz (his stage name) is, of course, the magician who will eventually become the famed Wizard of Oz.  The beginning of the movie gives some of his background and plays off the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" by being in smaller-frame and black and white.  Once we get to Oz, however, the screen expands and the colors are fabulous...all you could expect.  There are also shades of people he knows back in Kansas as Oz picks up companions along the way, and makes a few nasty enemies, including our favorite green-skinned Wicked Witch.<br /><br />Loved the tornado scene, even though this is one of the changes made from the original story.  Despite these changes, Oz does pay homage to a certain extent to the original, and offers some insights into how things got to where they are (there are hints of the scarecrow and a potential clue about the cowardly lion), but some of the plot was a shade too simplistic and predictible.<br /><br />As a lover of Oz, this movie is a plus all the same...and I wouldn't be without it.  But as a stand-alone movie it doesn't work as well.  Perhaps, the choice in actor for the lead character might have been better, because I must admit that he didn't seem capable of carrying this movie in light of the special effects and the far more dramatic characters of the Witches and the land of Oz itself.<br /><br />Could have been a great movie if the characters had been given as much work as the special effects.  Wish it had been.  Will keep it, but I doubt it will ever be a classic.
B009OYTIXS|5.0|I love superhero movies and series. I watched Smallville on CW faithfully for 10 seasons. When it ended, I stopped watching the network because there wasn't any action type of series I could get in to.<br /><br />When I purchased Amazon Prime, the series Arrow popped up as an instant video suggestion. I purchased it and was not disappointed. The producers have done an excellent job of building the suspense and unfolding the various characters and plots. I love how they give you different parts of Oliver's history on the island every week. It keeps you intrigued and on edge. And I love Green Arrow, because like Batman, he has had to build his human strength to become a hero.<br /><br />If you liked Smallville, and loved Avengers, this series will be a great weekly \\"superhero action fix\\" until the next Avengers, GI Joe, Iron Man or Superman comes out.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

0525478817|5.0|I expected it to take a week or so for the book to arrive but it literally took two days. I fell in love with the book after reading it for just ten minutes and didn't stop reading it until i was finished. so let's just say i was up until 3am reading it. it is a very very wonderful book, but it is a tear jerker. out of all the books i have ever read, this is the only one i have ever cried while reading. I have had my fair share of sad books too.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|All has already been said about this spellbinding, history-making record by MR MICHAEL J.

No other album has rivaled that statistic as yet and I strongly doubt if that ever will happen. \\"THRILLER\\" as a single album has eclipsed most other musical artist's entire careers, it is indeed the ultimate eclipser!!!.<br />MR MICHAEL JOSEPH JACKSON was at his zenith, the ultimate entertainer, a talent and a life like no other, indeed a true phenomenon in every sense of it, he had no challenge, he was literally competing against himself!!!.<br />Each and every song on THRILLER is a solid hit, from maddening funk to the most tender of ballads, so perfectly and meticulously crafted, instrumentally and vocally, this stunning record is perfect from start to finish, this album have it all, from \\"WANNA BE STARTIN'SOMETHIN'\\", \\"BABY BE MINE\\", \\"THE GIRL IS MINE\\", \\"THRILLER\\", \\"BEAT IT\\", \\"BILLIE JEAN\\", \\"HUMAN NATURE\\", \\"PRETTY YOUNG THING\\" to \\"THE LADY IN MY LIFE\\". Each song creates a different emotional state. Very potent.<br />No music collection can ever be complete without this essential effort.It is very well secure in my private stock. Very highly recommended, now available in different editions, an amazing introduction to the world of modern pop/r&b, a part of history itself and I know it will endure for hundreds of years in the distant future because it is indeed timeless. Thrills awaits...  THRILLER is not an album you want, THRILLER is indeed an album you need !!!.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Diamon Dash- Ok but not much of a challenge..would recommend to others.ok....ok..ok...ok..nothing else to say about the game ok...<br /><br />EJMFowler
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Yes, I have not written many book reviews. I usually don't feel compelled to write book reviews, most of the reviews already up sum it up. This book, however, is in a class of its own. As I posted on Facebook while I was reading Wool, &#34;help, I'm reading Wool, and I cannot put it down!&#34;  Original story, extreamly well written, like nothing else I've ever encountered. Read this book, you will not regret it. Well maybe, if it's nice outside, and you are glued to the book and cannot put it down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Sure wish there was a hint button on this app. It was a fun and addictive game. Would love more levels.<br />Maggie
B00881VLCE|2.0|I liked the puzzle but the second time I tried to bring it up I waited for 2 or 3 minutes,for it to download, got frustrated, and deleted the game.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Easy to use.  Gives great flexibility in using documents with mobile device.  Sync updates both ways when the document is changed on either device.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it.  It would be better if there was a hint button.  I only played it once.  I would have liked to go back a level to see if I missed anything.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. I am good at it.  I parable have 9000 peaces of diamond the best thing in the game.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was a good read, especially if you're a zombie aficionado. It is more than just a story about survival and gore. It was great to read the many perspectives (military, government, civilians, scientists) from the initial outbreak to post war. The interviews were very passionate, and provided great details. You always wonder, what are the survivor's stories? This book taps into that question. Another plus is that the stories are not from isolated regions, each one comes from a different location in the world. I highly recommend the read! Worth it!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The writers for Dexter are great. They hold your attention in every episode and keep you anticipating the next show.
B006UG90RM|3.0|This cd is okay, but nothing great.  They sent me a cd with a broken case.  It had been dropped and the plastic was damaged.  It was packed in tight with the other cd's I bought.  It was broken before it was packaged and just covered up.  I would send it back, but I  want it for my library.  A couple of the songs I really like, the rest are so so. It is nothing like Diver Down was.  I am glad they are trying to make new material though.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|After I purchased Deathly Hallows part II, I never realized that I missed Part I.  I spent months looking for it when a friend suggested Amazon.  I had it within days and watched it immediately.  I now have the complete set of Harry Potter.
B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|The Innkeepers is a slower paced thriller about two co-workers who are going about their lackluster jobs at a historic inn that is supposedly haunted. The inn has had too few visitors to stay in business and is in its final weekend of operation. Claire and Luke tend to the front desk and the few guests at the inn and find ways to pass the time which includes discussion of the inn's haunted past. The wise saying, \\"Be careful where you aim, because you might hit it\\" comes to mind. The movie is not a thrill a minute, but builds up the suspense gradually.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|This album was really good. It kinda had a 808s & Heartbreak sort of feel but just a little less sad and emotional and a more explicit. Overall it is a good album despite it only being 10 songs. I liked all of them except \\"Black Skinhead\\" for some reason and it is one of those rare albums where I can listen to the whole thing over and over again instead of just only listening to a select few songs. I would absolutely recommend this album to others, especially if you are a true Kanye fan and can understand his unique dare to be different style of craft.
B00CNKPBBI|2.0|I've read all of Vince Flynn's novels and raved about each of them.  I am 75% through The Last Man, and I wonder where this came from. It is slow and plodding.  Mitch Rapp seems to be a minor character.  I was surprised when this book came out so soon after Kill Shot, and I'm not sure what the timing had to do with it, but this is not a typical Vince Flynn book.  I wrote the previous comments on 6/17/2013 and today 6/20 I learned that Vince had lost his battle with prostate cancer.  By all accounts Vince Flynn was a very special person to everyone who knew him. Although I knew him only through his books, I am deeply saddened by his passing. I have not decided if I will finish his last book.  I am sensing that there might be comfort in knowing there is a little more to read.
B009AMANBA|5.0|it was a fantastic movie! great actresses and actors and a wonderful story telling! aLL OF THE CAST WAS PERFECT TO TELL THE STORY
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I lost my mother, grandmother and uncle to cancer in the last twelve months. This left me feeling defeated-like a ticking time bomb. It was going to only be a matter of time before cancer stole my life or another loved one. This book have me hope and a different perspective and that is irreplaceable.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game, good clean funny. You don't HAVE to spend $$ if you don't want to. Mobile app works well.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Great Movie, Great Price!!  I have no complaints at all - we knew what we were buying as our daughter loves this movie.  Brand new, original packaging and has been watched over and over.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Interesting concept. With money I guess anyone can accomplish whatever the like, as this Yemeni man did. Actors presented superb performances.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I first heard of FSOG, I didn't think I'd like it.  But a friend said she thought it was a great story.  I have now read all 3 books and its definitely a great story.  Both characters are unique, and how they conquer their differences , falling in love and finding a balance is amazing.  The story is well written, the email passages are funny and very cleverly a big part of the story.  Ana, is actually a very strong person, and admirable in many ways.  Christian is maddening at times, most times,  but his demeanor softens as he realizes Ana is what and all he needs.  Yes, there is lots of sex, some of it almost silly but the love story is just plain good stuff.
B007L6VR12|3.0|Not sure I understood this type of comedy. It had a great cast which was deceiving, but it came across as no one really acting, just acting silly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its great fun finding all the individual pieces and trying to find the right sequence in order to escape the room.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little shrapener, but i didnt at first know if i was suppose to use the carbide then the ceramic or vice versa, so i would like to have a 1 and 2, so i know in which order i should use them
B00COGXX7A|1.0|Please don't watch this movie! No matter what anyone tells you. Most Nicholas sparks movies are good. This one was ridiculous
B000VSAEYI|5.0|My kids love it! Water shoots out from all the sides and they love the slide.  I have a 2 and 4 yr old and they really enjoy it.  Best part is that its not too deep so it's easier to empty out and clean.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game and great graphics. I would say this is a game for all ages. And also you can get the game for free!
B003G4W49C|4.0|At times it dragged on a bit. Overall it was very good and the first and last few chapters were great
B0058SNI94|5.0|I normally wear an 8 1/2. I went by the guidelines it gave for sizing which was to go a half size down. They fit great! I am a hairstylist who stands a lot. My feet feel great at the end of the day.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|As soon as the movie finished, I had to get this. I won't lie, It won me over with the opening credits.<br /><br />Played it on the way to work today & it's perfect.<br /><br />This cd is exactly what I wanted. I mostly got it for Cliff Martinez' work but it even convinced me to buy the Chromatics & Kavinsky cd's too!!!<br /><br />lucky for me Amazon has those too!!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|pretty sure those of you whineing about lorn adds are just reposting because I haven't seen 1 yet and ive used this app for a long time
B0064MPXFA|3.0|I didn't start watching these until last September so I have started with the pilot episode to catch up with what's happened to get the show where it is now.  They are kind of slow to watch but ok.  Love the commercial free viewing and they are all free so far with Amazon Prime.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I'm so excited to see this as the free app today! I got one full version a couple years back as a free app and have since purchased two more and used two of them as free apps. They are great for home workouts and I like using them on my kindle for the bigger screen. The instruction is great and the workouts are targeted.  It switches between exercises pretty quickly though, so I've found it's easier to scroll through the routine first and read about any moves you're not familiar with before actually working through it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The object of this game is to help Nemo build a reef.  You plant different kinds of coral and sea plants, and certain plants or plant combos attract new fish.  The game is really simple, but highly addictive.  The graphics are great- beautiful plants and colorful fish.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's very hard to get anywhere in the game without spending actual money to buy pearls- you use the pearls to buy rare plants to attract rare fish.  Without the pearls, it's almost impossible to do this.  I splurged and spent $1.99 for some pearls because I realized I wasn't getting anywhere without them.  I figured that's about the price I would pay for a game, anyway.  But now I'm already out of pearls!  I would rather spend a flat fee of a few dollars to buy a game, than get a &#34;free&#34; game that I have to keep spending money on.  Darn you, Disney, you got me hooked on this game and you know I'll pay to keep playing!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Anyone who loves Rod Stewart will absolutely LOVE this CD. He is still the BEST!!! So many new songs that he wrote! LOVE IT!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like the game, but there are not enough levels!! I will have to remove it if there are not more levels soon.
B003BW0CB6|2.0|I was taken totally by surprise and disappointed by the ending of he book. Usually enjoy his books but this one was a little confusing.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis gave the best performance by an actor in this film (all time). You thought you were looking at Lincoln. Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones were also great too...
B007FIY3VW|4.0|I am using this app on a nextbook 7se tablet. It works fine, however i am only able to save files (that will print) in the &#34;.doc&#34; file format. I have open office on my home computer instead a micro soft program. I believe this is why i am unable to print the other formats. It works fine for me though, I don't do much printing from the tablet. I am still trying to figure out how to change the &#34;letter&#34; size page margins, but i think that's a problem with my printer. All in all a pretty good app for less than a dollar.
1612930832|5.0|Truth The Rich And Successful Dont Want You To Know....Read It Study It Apply It...The Law Of Attraction Is Real!
B008JF8O9M|2.0|Although this is a very nice app, the paid version (after the trial version) is just way too expensive. It works well and is a great app but I just can't see spending that much on a printing program. Maybe if you're using it for school or work or something and have a wireless printer to use. It would be costly using with a wired printer. I'm now using the &#34;print my files&#34; app, only cost .99 cents.
B009NY43NY|3.0|For this being the last Sookie Stackhouse book, I really expected more from the story line. It just abruptly ended like maybe one day she will decide to write another one.
B0084P9202|5.0|The title says it all.  Though, I have long time sigur ros friends who liked it far less.  It's the prettier side of SR, if you are looking for more metal, see the new album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Cheesy at some parts but sometimes I guess that's what love is. I couldn't put it down. Love it. Loved the first one. Loved this one. Can't wait to read the last one. I will be sad its over though. Must read.
0425263924|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Crossfire Series.  Book # 3, Entwined with You, did not disappoint!  Actually, it ended just how I wanted it to!  I am excited to see what the future holds for Eva & Gideon.  I love the characters, especially Eva.  In another very familiar book series, the female lead was not a regular acting woman.  I could not relate to her in any way.  Eva is easy to relate to in many ways.  She is a true modern woman and will do what she has to do to get her man!
034580404X|5.0|I was traveling and my friend requested this. I did not want to waste my energy and precious time trying to hunt it down store to store. I chose this method and it was the right thing to do.  My friend loved it.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have had evernote for some time but I didn't fully understand the usefulness of the program.  After hearing  so many good things about the app I finally gave it a try.  I'm giving it a try and so far I am finding EN pretty is  pretty cool
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Both the subject and the information are unreal.  Adam's story is one that everyone should know.  I will recommend this book to all friends and family.
B00DE0RQM8|5.0|Another catchy Britney song.  Destined to be a perfect song for summer.  The song has wide demographic appeal from kids to adults.  Enjoy!
B00874T02K|5.0|If you are in decent shape and are trying to gain some more muscle, then this is a great app for a low price. You select your work out do your asked amount of reps and you get a well deserved brake. I would highly recommend that you don't cheat but actually do it with your best effort. I just love this app and I would recommend it to any one who likes exercising.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|the game is fun....getting to customize ypur own restauramt...but they expect for you to wait around all day to check your food....for  example..if you were cooking sonetthinh for 4 hours they expect youbto wiatm..and if your late then u wastedvyourbmkney
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Seems like he just threw this together and I'm not feeling it. His arrogance is too much for me handle anymore.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was starting to have cooling issues on my processor before I installed this.  I had the stock fan on there originally(of course it was overheating!)  I now have this installed and my processor never really goes above 40 degrees now! whereas before i would find it around 80-90 before!  Btw i am not around my computer right now but I believe those readings are in celsius.  Great fan, including all installation gear and works like a charm!
0385344228|5.0|This is the first work I've read by William Landay and while I do not read a lot of legal thrillers, something in the book description pulled me in.  I was hooked within the first few pages.  Defending Jacob is full of twists and turns and the reader is kept guessing for the entirety of the novel.  I will be reading more of Mr. Landay's work!
B005HSL626|2.0|There are too many ads and the app freezes. I suppose the &#34;free&#34; is why the ads are required. Sigh.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I can't believe it's actually over. It was a good run. A great story and I admire every character. It was nice to watch them grow!
159463176X|5.0|The first chapter tells a terrific allegory. The story develops into a gripping tale of honor and courage with great sacrifice.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I love this guy and I hate him. Doctor Hannibal before  his later infamy. I grew up watching Silence of the Lambs. It was my moms favorite movie so I saw it tons of times as a child. Now to see a tv show of him in his early year, this is great.  He's not as...thoughtful as I had hoped but still, I love the character.
B00874T02K|5.0|I always feel pumped with this work out! This is great as a main work out and as a supplementary work out. I add these to my core stuff all the time and I feel great. Great for starters and the expert's alike.
0679746048|5.0|It was weird how much I could relate to the main character, yes, the one in the nut house. I'm sure that we all can relate in some way. Great book and I totally recommend it to everyone who has ever been down a similar road.
0062014102|5.0|Talbot's work has become a seminal work in philosophy and a thought-provoking extension to string theories. The Holographic Universe will make one think about what one thinks he already about the universe. Talbot's views of the universe, although startling different from current, accepted views, are not so different from traditional, historical views. A fascinating theory of how the universe really works that includes the role of human consciousness.
B0053O89WY|4.0|This was not one of my favorite seasons. It was still good but not great. I don't know, just my personal opinion but I think it could have been way better! Someone is slacking!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a lot of fun playing this game so far I have played all 8 levels. Remember to take notes.
0156027321|5.0|I just want to say that after I read the book, the movie ended up coming out a little bit later. The movie actually took away from the book. I wish I hadn't seen it. The adventure is amazing. I laughed, I cried and I NEVER get emotional with book. The author did an amazing job. It was a wonderful story.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|simply a classic album, i listen to black sabbath every day, every track sounds perfect and this wonderfully written music never gets old,
B003TOS8K8|5.0|I am a huge classical music fan so when it comes to artists outside that genre, I am a bit picky. I love how she mixes her music to create something so soothing and lovely. Yes, lovely is the word I want to use to describe her music. And it is
B00005K9LM|4.0|this is a classic album by judas priest it has an excellent sound that is distinct to 80s heavy metal, overall a good album but not as good as screaming for vengeance.
B000V7J82S|5.0|I already had the music on my ipod but I wanted the vinyl to view mainly. It looks great. It plays well. It came on time. Everything about it is great!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Next update should include redstone more spawners pistons enchantment tables boats stuff like that then it would be like xbox and pc edition but on the go.
B000002UB2|5.0|Who doesn't love the Beatles? The vinyl came on time, no scratches, it plays very well. I have no complaints.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I had very high expectations when the book came out. But it was different and ok. Not as good as the kite runner and a thousand splendid suns. After reading those two books again and again, this was a let down.
B002BWP49C|4.0|If I hadn't read the book, I would have given it 5 stars. The movie is amazing. Not my favorite in the saga but still pretty good. It was not as fast paced as I had hope it would be but still, an AMAZING movie!
B005S9ELY4|4.0|I normally do not like Sean Penn movies, but he did a good job in this one.  A good story and somewhat original in the genre.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This DVD arrived on time, I have had no problems with it at all. Love the movie! Actually, I love the entire saga! Read the books though, you will thank me.
B000FCK65W|5.0|My mom gave me this book to read when I was thirteen and gave me permission to stay up all night reading it, which I did. The older I get, I encounter more and different truths each time I read it. Truly a book for the ages of woman.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|After I saw the movie, I went out and read all the books. OMG, what a journey. This is a great story. I totally admire ALL of the characters who are tributes. This was an amazing idea for a story!
B004XQO90E|4.0|I love technology and medical stuff so this brings all of that into line. Watch the film and enjoy yourself.
B0041T52S6|5.0|This movie is freaking awesome! I absolutely love the music in here. Scott Pilgrim is basically a 23 year old slacker that's in a band and has awesome fighting skills. I love the video game and comic effects that appear throughout the movie. I would def. reccomend this to everyone. Actually I have been.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I haven't received my copy yet, but the cast in this movie is fabulous, the story delightful, and the music is out of this world.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I love it, best sharpner ever!!! perfect size, makes miracles with dull or damaged knifes be careful with your fingers when using it..
B0094K1PW4|2.0|I thought this would be great because of JJ Abrams and Speilberg.  but it was really slow and boring.  the action wasnt that great and it never built up into a good movie.  everyone should just pass and not waste your time.
B009SJ47XA|5.0|I really hate scary movies. Call me a wimp, but the horror genre does not sit well with me, mostly because it lacks quality in acting and production. That is not the case with Season 2 of this show. The acting is top-notch, the cinematography rocks and the plot line, while obviously crazed, is enrapturing. If you have reservations, give it a shot; I'm glad my friends convinced me to watch it with them. By the third episode I knew I had to watch the rest. Great show!
B004WGIXX4|4.0|good romance comedy.  Not as funny as i thought.  Ashton's character in the movie is a push over though.  but still pretty funny
B0024RIMBG|5.0|Love the Celtic Woman and all their music.<br />Have a collection of most of their works.<br />Enjoy being entertained? Then try these ladies for easy listening and  entertainment
B007GE2H3G|5.0|great kid flick.  a mystery that is both funny and adventurous.  we really enjoyed it.  plus it had a great plot and action. highly recommended.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that Iron Man was by far my favorite super hero when I was a kid. I still have a ton of the old comics I used to read. I understand people not liking artistic license that is brought out in movies. There are times when it ruins a movie for me too. That being said...<br /><br />Iron Man 3 was every bit as good as I was hoping for. There was a lot of intense action, some really funny lines and another look at an aspect of Tony Stark that makes him even more relatable as a person. The essence of Tony Stark/Iron Man from the comics is still there in the movie. Sure, there were some twists that some may not have enjoyed. But when fleshed out were really funny. My wife and I enjoyed this movie immensely, and it will be joining our home movie collection once it comes out.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|I like seeing Cirque Du Soleil's magnificent \\"O\\" show whenever I stay at my favorite hotel in the world, Bellagio, in Las Vegas.  Having bought most of the earlier Cirque dvds, I was looking forward to this one as well.  It does an excellent job of filming customized scenes of \\"O\\", \\"Ka\\" and other shows, tied together with a storyline that serves well to bridge the connection between scenes.<br /><br />In addition to Cameron's cinematic brilliance in capturing the footage, I especially liked the bonus video with Erica Linz explaining how they develop the acts and the behind-the-scenes insights she shared.  And the last act is magnificent, with her and the aerialist together.  I watched this in regular bluray, not having a 3d tv, however after hearing James' insights on 3d I'm tempted to get a 3d set to watch this in that as well.  Unlike simply capturing just footage from live shows, the scenes here were shot in closeup with customized camera work, adding extra depth and camera angles only available here.<br /><br />Very well done, remarkably creative and colorful, well worth watching to capture highlights of the world-class showmanship that the team at Cirque Du Soleil performs, with storytelling flair.  Bravo!<br /><br />-Ken
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|This CD is full of exactally the type of music I am interested in listening to this summer, and for many summers to come. Hanson proves that they continue to grow musically and lead the way as solid, and talented musicians. If you are looking for music that gets your blood pumping, this is the CD for you. Their songs are mirrors of their aptly named title: Anthem. Rock on!
1936608898|5.0|This book has changed my life.  From my relationship to food, to my personal health issues addressed by eating this way, and this new energy and stamina - and even the ability to say no to dessert because of what it does to my body - not because I am forbidden to eat it - I am a different person because of reading this book.<br /><br />Thank you to the Hartwigs!  I also recommend getting the book, WellFed to go along with this book - you will not regret it!
0316017930|5.0|The idea that success is something that can happen to anyone who tries is often misguided. This book shows that it is much more than that. It takes the right background, opportunities, timing, and ambition all at the same time.
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|I love this book and this version of the movie. The blu ray disc plays like it should. Happy with my purchase.
B0025KW29U|5.0|First off I have to admit, I hate musicals. There are a few exceptions, but as a general rule of thumb, I can't stand them. However, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog has skyrocketed up to the very tip of my favorite movie list. The casting could not be any better. Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, the adorably geeky Felicia Day. Short spots by other actors we've come to love such as Simon Helberg (from The Big Bang Theory). You can't get any better! The songs are quirky and fun and just downright EVIL in how they slip into your brain and stay there for days...or weeks...or months. Everyone should watch this movie. And buy the soundtrack.  And buy the Blu-Ray because the extras are almost as amazing as the movie itself.  Seriously. Buy this movie! Then watch it at least 6 times because that's the minimum that the subliminal messages allow I think.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|A Touching story, good plot and beautiful color in the film. It was not like the original but I would recommend the movie to all ages, clean and not full of sex and violence.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Everyone should get this game. The best game I played. So addicting. I love this game. It is free and easy to play.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Hanson's last album was a homage to motown, so it's not really surprising that this one, called Anthem, borrows heavily from the anthem rock of the 1970s. You can still hear the motown sound, but with bits of Queen, U2, even Michael Jackson mixed in. It still sounds modern, though, and one track even reminds me of fun. There are very few songs here that I would skip over. It's a much more \\"Hansony\\" album than Shout It Out, with more guitar, less horns and power ballads all over the place. Definitely worthy of the title Anthem!
0446693804|5.0|Well when the book came in it was in great condition, no tears or wears.  So I was overall satisfied.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Beautiful score. The soundtrack does great justice to the film. Mr.Zimmer's score is ethereal and emotional consistently. It holds up with John William's score for the Superman (1978) film and even outdoes it on many occasions.
0761171703|4.0|Saw this at a coffee shop and decided to get a copy for our daughter, which we did, but we read through it first. Original and arresting photos.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I liked Star Trek The Next Generation and this movie is like a newer not cheesy update to the old Star Trek series.<br />There's lots of action and drama and its interesting to see how the younger versions of these characters act upon pressure.<br />I also liked that the original Spock was in this movie in segments to unite the storyline.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I love the way the author weaves actual historical events into this hilarious, entertaining book.  I couldn't  put it down
B009O07NMA|5.0|This is probably the first album that I have completely loved from start to finish. I rarely listen to albums all the way through (and certainly not the first time I listen to it), but I just seemed to like every song as it played through. It's been playing non-stop since the day I bought it! If you like the singles on here that are out on the radio now, you should like the rest of the album. This kind of music makes me think of summer times on the lake... Nothing better to get me through the work day or to prep me for the weekend!
0553256491|5.0|classic feynman genius as he recounts his life experiences in his own charismatic way. cream or sugar? both. surely you're joking mr feynman!
0425263908|3.0|I think it's sad that an author as seasoned as Sylvia felt she needed to write a story similar to Fifty Shades. I would have respected her more if she came up with an original story. Those of you reading my review please don't take it personal if I don't agree with what you think about this story.<br /><br />I just really felt like this story came up short. I enjoy the sex scenes but that's what I got more then anything else. There was no one, two, punch or really anything that made me hunger for what was going to happen next. It was just a repeated reminder that Gideon is beautiful and everyone else thinks so too. It was a lot of interference by men and women in their relation(he said, she said mess), and not much grit. I just felt like her story mentioned similar things that were in Fifty Shades but didn't deliver. For example, Gideon continues to mention spanking, a little BDSM vocab, and even has her choose a safe word but never delivers. He's not a Dom he's just a control freak, and Eva is just hot and horny for him, so a submissive that does not make.<br /><br />I accidentally read Entwined With You first mixing it up with a third installment of another series I had been waiting on to come out. I've had the first two for months but was waiting to have all three before I started reading. Having stated that I read the third book first, and I will read it again after I've read the second. I must say the third book is even less of an attention grabber then this one and more, he said she said mess, with everyone involved in their relationship. The third book eludes to fights with family members, and supposed cheating or betrayal from Gideon which must have happened in the second book because it sure didn't happen in the first, so I have high hopes for the second book, but I'm not kidding myself. I'll definitely read all the books in this series because I can't just leave a book out, but I'll also read all the books in the series because I can't help but want the story line to get better. It's more then a want its a desperate need.  Otherwise it's all for not.  If you decide to read this book and the rest of the books in the series; please don't go into it comparing it to Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy. I really don't think that's fair to either author. Read this book with no insight in mind but read it just to enjoy the story, and see how that approach fairs out for you. Unfortunately, that experience was tainted for me. I had friends tell me this series was a sad copy cat story of the Shades books and then I read the professional reviews of the book,(on the actual physical book) saying it was better then Fifty, and other reviewers on Amazon made comparisons. I tried very hard to just read and give a review based off of my fresh opinion right after I finished, but that was impossible once I saw someone's review titled, \\"Better Then Fifty.\\"  I know that's someone's opinion and we all have our right to them, but I have to ask this: If Fifty wasn't that good why are so many well seasoned writers out there copying her story? Why have so many authors changed the covers on their already released books to look like Fifty Shades covers, and why is it still selling like hot cakes?<br />That trilogy was her first writing debut and it has sold millions and talks of a movie are in the works. It was written well, it was original and fresh, and it introduced alot of people to a genre they never knew anything about. Me, being in that category.  Instead of hating I think people should applaud whether they like it or not because it has definitely brought attention to this type of genre and to authors who have been writing these types of books all a long but couldn't get the recognition they deserved.  Sex toy stores have seen a rise in sales, and authors have seen a rise in sells on books they have written in the past 5 years. People are more aware and hungry for erotica. Lastly, it's also put a lot of spice in marriages and relationships.<br />I just want to challenge Silvia to move me. I want to laugh, cry, get angry, have some kind of strong emotion while reading this series. I read many of her books and will continue because I know she's capable of delivering.<br />Sorry if I've offended anyone, truly I am.>I just want to challenge Silvia to move me.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|great dvd of the web released classic from the writers strike of 2008. Neil Patrick Harris, Felecia Day, and Nathan Fillion work perfectly together in this superhero comedy musical.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great Price Great Service<br />I am a great fan and I sent these to my Granddaughter<br />She loves them and was very happy to have them
0393026590|5.0|if you enjoyed surely you're joking mr feynman you will enjoy this. i think of it as a part two to that book.
0525478183|5.0|Like all other John Green books this book was excellent! I would absolutely read a sequel, although I doubt there will be one!
B008FTAAG2|5.0|More 'poppy' than most of the music I listen to, but still metal enough for me to enjoy it. Definitely their best album yet.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|I bought this not knowing exactly what it was all about.  the documentary was informative, well done, and fun to watch.  I think Dave Grohl did a great thing saving this recorder. watch it.
B00CJ1C7UO|5.0|A great album full of Amorphis' special kind of metal. Each song is an adventure and full of its own unique imagery. Melodic death metal at its finest.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love this app very mind boggiling recommend highly great to unwind and relax very detailed and challenging wish it had more levels
B00CDT41RY|5.0|While still quite violent, Django Unchained was a delightful romp through a painful historical period. Characters were always very enjoyable. All-in-all it was a very enjoyable experience.
B005LAIH2C|1.0|Horribly violent and gory.  Horrible plot, and way too much gore to even make it good.  Really bad movie, just don't.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really think its cool and its fun to play and I really really really really like it I play it all day long man
0452295548|5.0|This book is excellent on multiple levels.  It is a treatise on how to compassionately engage and help stroke impaired individuals, it is an insight into what/who we as human beings really are, and it is a tribute to the indomitable human spirit.  Most importantly of all, perhaps, it is a fascinating road map to higher consciousness.  I not only recommend this book, I will actively offer my copy to everyone I know.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|...not the best, or probably not as good as it should have been. The immersiveness is still there, but 4&5 were a little too disjointed. Still looking forward to #6, though. I'm definitely still engaged with the overarching stories
B00AKO93JK|1.0|no download instruction like in the past apps i have purchased, when i go the list of all apps it says not compatable, however, it also says this on previous apps that are installed and working  ???
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I choose this rating because I love the acting and Julie. I was always wondering if they ever connected after a change encounter on a train going to Paris. I love the song sung to Ethan in the last scene in the apartment.
144937980X|4.0|If you want to start programming with processing, this book would definitely be useful.  When it arrived, I sat down at my desk to go through the features and was impressed with how easy to use both the language itself as well as the instructional book were.  However, I think I expected more from the examples.  The examples given in the book will demonstrate the bare bones features of a given function or tool, but to apply those features to impressive projects will require some tinkering with the program yourself.<br /><br />Overall, that's almost exactly what the book advertised, and it does the job pretty well.  This book is inexpensive, lightweight, easy to follow, and I recommend it to all who want to get started with processing and also have an idea of what they want to build with it.
B001NA6096|5.0|I loved this film because you were captive to Ethan and Julie discovering their connection. You hope that there is more to their them then just a chance encounter. In the end you never know if there is future together. I was blown away when the Ethan and Julie created the second now third film. This is the touchstone film that introduces you to what makes a relationship last when you are in your 20's, 30's and 40's
B0077PBPY6|4.0|First of all, BIRDSONG is beautifully filmed and acted. Joseph Mawle is especially memorable as Jack Firebrace--who I quote in my title here--a friend and sort of foil-character to the protagonist (Stephen Wraysford) played by Eddie Redmayne. Agree: American audiences may find all the British brogues a bit hard to follow without the subtitles.<br /><br />While there is a palpable storyline and a good surprise at the end, BIRDSONG appeals more to the heart than to the head. It's quite a sad story, of course, but it avoids going too far in the direction of melodrama. It successfully incorporates some really huge themes: Love, forgiveness, loyalty, and others. There is also a great deal of WWI battle footage: BIRDSONG will probably appeal to most war film aficionados. Warning: Some really graphic scenes of carnage at the Somme and various other battles.<br /><br />Part I shifts every few minutes from Wraysford's illicit 1910 love affair with the wife of a French business partner to his service in the British army between 1916-18. The two time settings are extremely well-synchronized: The directors and producers did a fine job of making the two stories into one. Part II, though it follows the same general pattern, is a little more of a straightforward, solidified story.<br /><br />I haven't read Sebastian Faulks's original novel, but I've heard nothing but good things about it. It's probably a hard book to cinematize, but Masterpiece Theater did about the best job possible here.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Great book, read with an open mind.  It will change how you view your diet and carbohydrates.  If you want the truth, Gary Taubes provides it with clinical evidence.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved this game so much that even when I die i still come back to play because its like an addition
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Can you escape is a &quot;point and click&quot; enviromental puzzler. Although the puzzles are fun, they are fairly easy. This fact is compounded by the brevity of the game (beat it in 30 minutes).<br />Considering the price (FREE), it's easily worth it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is my favorite of all....it really takes a good imagination and a small art skill to play....looking for more partners!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was a very good book and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to read the other two books
B00881VLCE|4.0|fun for  a quick game....i love puzzles but would like to see the pic to know what I was doing first.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I played this game on my first generation Kindle Fire.  Wonderful room escape app. Challenging but not unsolvable.  No obscure references or illogical code answers like I have seen in some room escape apps.  Great app if you are new to room escape games.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|These boys on these disks put the history of ass kickin&#34; rock down forever. All great stuff that reminds us why this band is and American Original and forever classic!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun. Works your brain, but is not frustrating. Well planned. great game when you are bored or stressed out.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|I won't go song by song, but this is Kanye's most progressive work since 808s & Heartbreak. Yeezus goes in a totally different - and more extreme - direction. Kanye experimenting is typically Kanye at his best, and that's what's happening here. There is a ton of hate pouring out from everyone *except* the music critics on this album, and it's totally undeserved. Fans lament a return to autotune, an angry, grating tone throughout, and few tracks likely to become club / dance standards for 2013. That's fine by me - this an album of Mr. West doing what I want him to do: making some great, thoughtful music.<br /><br />808s was panned when it was released, but it's matured into a fantastic album, and remains one of my favorites of all time. Yeezus is likely to achieve such a status as well. Kanye really is a musical genius, whether or not you like him as a person aside. Yeezus is dark, introspective, but also shamelessly arrogant and self-centered. And that's exactly what I expect of West's lyrics. He is the narcissism, the self-love (and hate), the guilty pleasures living inside all of us. The difference? He doesn't try to hide those feelings. He embraces them to the point that they are offensive, and I think even Kanye realizes that. It's interesting to hear his critics talk of his personal values, when he is also one of hip-hop / rap's most open-minded figures, eschewing much of the double-standard misogyny, violence, and homophobia that those genres became synonymous with endorsing.<br /><br />Kanye West has done, and continues to do, more for progressing the hip-hop community than any other artist of his generation. Hate on his narcissism, his crudeness, or his tuned voice all you want, because I'll take this over any of the formulaic junk most top 40 artists are putting out these days.
B00AECGQF2|2.0|Honestly it isn't thaty great it only has like 6 faces to use and you can only do so many hairstyles and it was way to expensive it is pretty much stupid.
0316067598|5.0|Amazing book of one tough S.O.B. God bless our troops and thank you for your service. Having a small glimpse into the lives of Marcus and his comrades was an honor to read.
B009EFP278|5.0|I am happy to say that I am a new fan of Olly Murs.  His talent is reminiscent of Maroon 5 blended with the style of a 50's crooner.  His upbeat beats will put a pep in your step for hours.  He is my new favorite.
B0001YRVN4|1.0|RELEASE THE ORIGINAL MOVIES!!!! ENOUGH WITH THIS BULLSH*T<br />I dont understand how they can charge this much money for material that is not the original film that inspired millions of people. It's like all of this remastered crap is done just to turn new generations away from some of the most beautiful art ever created. Why remaster a film, insert new scenes and change dialogue, especially of a movie that could arguably be the most popular movie ever made. The same goes for an album like Nevermind. If it needed to be better sounding or remastered than it would not have sold MILLIONS of copies. BOYCOT THIS CRAP!
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Of course we Love this, I mean it's Paul McCartney, He was, is and always will be great. Yes, Love, Love just about covers it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This Game is addicting! Definitely starts out slow but it picks up after a while. Got me through a boring day of jury duty lol it definitely passes the time!
B005K17RU0|1.0|What have you done?? It worked well, was intuitive and presented the information in an aesthetically pleasing format. The update is awful.  Will be uninstalling after I submit this review.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|This film is a rip off of the greatest japanese film ever made, battle royale! This is the same, only its pg 13. Does not do justice, battle royale was based on a book as well, not this crap. Quentin tarantinos top 20 films, battle royale.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|,I am a mom of three - two girls, 16 &amp; 10; one boy, 4 - and my mind won't shut off when I lay down to sleep.  I have been using a fan for years, tried using a sound machine, but it drove my husband nuts.  I decided to try this app and it's perfect!  can mix and match my favorite sounds, adjust the volume on each sound, and it will play for as long as I need it to!  This free app blows me away with the amount of free sounds, plus there are the beta and theta waves settings, whicj I didn't put much stock into until I tried them.  The sounds put me in zen mode, and my brain shuts off - no more foggy brain from Tylenol pm!
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|If you're a world war 2 fan you'll like this game. I was hoping for this to be an fps world war.2 game, but oh well it's still fun.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! It's a scam and misleading! I'm phased-off Kindle Fire still supports this!!  You never ever get tv from America.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's an awesome game it's so fun for me to play it's not hard it's not easy it's just right
B002RZZIXU|2.0|Again mostly written in the first person-cannot deal with stories written this way. Did not finish which is a shame because I have enjoyed William Boyd s work before.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Excellent book, easy reading and obviously it comes straight from the heart of Mr. Kyle.  I loved this book and recommend it for everyone.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|You get to wash the princesses hair, give her spa treatment like a face clensing and cucumber facial, and do he makeup and dress her up.  IT IS SO FUN. But I wish they had more &quot;princess&quot; dresses. And not school dresses. But really fun I recommend this app for ages 1-13. I'm 11 and I play it. :)
B002N44XSG|4.0|It It was very informative and fun. I loved how Rick Riordan made the stories unpredictable and the endings were always surprising.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've tried a handful of versions of Spider and this is my favorite. It moves quickly and smoothly. I particularly like the one tap option -you tap on the card or stack you want to move and those cards jump to the best space available. It gives hints for possible moves and has some delightful displays when you win.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This cable shouldn't be so expensive, relatively, I mean it's a cable after all and its only purpose is charging!<br />Yet I like the idea of magnet attachment, it's very safe when holding the tablet and gives you freedom of use while charging.
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|Used on Nikon D7100. Mounted on a long boom with 10' Rode extension cable, The microphone<br />produced crisp clear audio with no noticeable interference.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It was well worth the $1 it cost me to get rid of the ads. Thank you Amazon for having the ad-free version.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|This camera bag has been very convenient and is bigger then it initially seems. It works great for keeping my equipment safe.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! It has hidden objects, multiple options, and it helps build your memory, all while playing this amazing game! Five stars!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Enjoyable read.  Interesting plot twists and believable characters.  I will read more books by this author.  I enjoy his writing style.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. I found it really interesting how it was written in letter form, because it makes it seem like he is talking to the reader. It had a heart-wrenching storyline and a wonderful perspective.
B009GFEOY8|5.0|Loved it! Easy to fit in my polariod and had no trouble at all! As soon as you put it in it takes pictures great. Make sure when you take the pictures you hold the camera very still or else it will come out all blurry and smeared looking. don't take pictures too close or they will be blurry. pictures come out the best 6 or more feet away.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|always like to listen to greatest hits cds. This has many extras on it besides the ones I know now.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|I, too, read the books because of the movie trailer.  When I saw the movie, I was so disappointed in what the authors allowed the screenwriter to do their novels.  I understand they have to change things due to time constraints but I felt as if they took the original story and made their own much crappier version.  It was almost as if they didn't have the rights to the books and had to change key elements to get away from copyright infringement.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who has read the books...or has a brain.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a fun game. The different layouts keep your mind busy trying to figure out the next move. This is one of the best versions I have played and it's free to boot. Do yourself a favor and download it. You won't be sorry.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|This album plays like a greatest hits album but the songs are all new! Yes, these songs are that good. I do not believe I have ever bought a new CD with all 14 songs, all-new and consistently high-grade (reflecting on some thirty wage-earning years gone by and better than 500 albums purchased). Hey, Bobby Keys plays sax! If that isn't a gauge of album caliber for you then we're not gonna see eye-to-eye on this one anyhow? Great price, yes - why not buy two and share with a friend? Or buy one and take a moment to write a review like me. Do it! You'll likely suffocate if you hold your breath waiting for the radio waves...
B0002KVULG|3.0|Saw this in the theater in the 1970s as a teenager (my Mom had to take me). We loved it. Because it was in GORGEOUS COLOR! This DVD is a washed out and pallid ghost of its former self. It's understandable that director John Badham (who, from his comments, never had much respect for the source material) became infatuated with that 1990's blue-grey pallet and decided to drain his film of color. But couldn't Badham have included the original color version on this release? I love this film and would buy it in a heartbeat if it were in its original drenched with color version, maybe with extra footage and bonus features. This version just makes me sad for what was, and what should have been.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I would love to try this game and it is supposed to be Kindle adaptable. But I can't download this app. If anyone has any suggestions- please<br /><br />pass it on.I would really like to try this game. Thanks. ( :
1591845556|1.0|I enjoyed Kaufman's first book and was looking forward to this one, especially since it deals with rapid learning.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"The First 20 Hours\\" is disappointing. The initial 20% of the book describes some general and fairly superficial principles for rapid learning. The remaining 80% provides an amateur's description of six topics of personal interest. If you're interested in Yoga, ukulele, web programming, wind surfing, touch typing, or the game \\"Go\\", and further want to know what an admitted amateur has discovered for himself about these topics, then you may find this book worthwhile. Otherwise I fear you will find it just a waste of time and money.<br /><br />You might assume I'm judging the book unfairly, and that the specific skills are actually being used to illustrate the application of the rapid learning principles. Oddly that is not the case. There's relatively little connection between what he writes about (say) the history and practice of Yoga and the principles expounded in the first few chapters. What you are left with is an odd \\"Wikipedia-grade\\" description of an eclectic handful of subjects. Like ... who cares?<br /><br />I'm sorry for the negative tone of this review, but I was disappointed. \\"The First 20 Hours\\" was not a good purchase for me and I do not recommend it.
0060254920|5.0|This is another one of those books, like Goodnight Moon, that every child should have an adult reading it lovingly (and with different voices) to.  The paintings are gorgeous and the imagination high and the ending....... as all children's books should be, at home and sweetly and safely in his bed.
B000002KY8|5.0|1999 wow i own this on vinyl as well its missing one track dmsr but its not a bad thing the tracks are full length not like the greatest hits cds where 1999 are single versions so at least the album is in full form its one of those most likeable songs and had two singles that came off it the other is little red corvett its an oldie but goodie for any prnce and the revalution fan amen

B008Z9L94O|5.0|wow i never thaught this would be rereleased on vinyl its been sold in its original vinyl formate for almost a thousand bucks give or take but ths remasterd 4 record set is cool then ever it comes in a slip box with 4 inner sleeves + 4 jackets its sound it great and its heavy weight vinyl so it has some meat on its bones its a really great addition to any vinyl collections and its under a hundred bucks so its a small chunk of change mmmmmmmm
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to get around the books and chapters.  There is nothing I don't like about this app.  I would recommend to anyone.
B00005KHJV|5.0|this version of halloween is one thats not easy to find these days it fills in the blanks and answers a few questions fans had for me its a more directors cut and a must have for any fan of the movies its a rare jem if you can find it grab it  i recondmend it it is the definitve version of halloween out there
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This game is certainly captivating, not simply because it is engaging but because it's engaging on numerous levels. The individual jewel games themselves are well organized and hold attention. There is also a story line associated with it, however, and larger objectives that make the game engaging long-term. Frustrating that you have to buy the extension that allows you full access, but certainly a good investment.

B00BHXUC4S|5.0|Wonderful pristine sound, nice collection of simple, hummable tunes. Not exactly a masterpiece but great tunes and a low price make this a must have for Jeff Lynne fans.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|As an &#34;Alien&#34; fan since the late 1970s...... this is a must have to round out the collection. Good movie, but does need a background and familiarity with the other films so you can really understand the storyline. Good effects, but a little fast paced. May need to watch it a few times to catch all the details.
B005LTDPJI|5.0|Wonderful price for a collection of great material. Nearly every album was of the highest quality and the bonus tracks were unique and fun.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This great read (do yourself a favor, read Silver Linings Playbook), made me feel the pain the two characters felt in this book. I was compelled to think about what it must be like to suffer from a mental illness. The journey back was heartwarming...
B007REV4T8|5.0|I love this movie and I love it more now that I have it. It was used but it works great.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|it's like another spin off of romeo and juliet with a nanny mcphee twist. it's worth the laughs at his awkward inner dialogue. i wish it went more into julie's pov as well.
B00000K0E5|5.0|I love 007 movies and this one is a great one to watch. I bought it used in great conditions.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I LOVE ZACHARY QUINT &#60;3<br />he is the best actor at playing bat crazy people! both in this and in Heroes (which i also recommend for the supernatural factor). this series has twists and turns that made me take away something different each time i watched this season. i absolutely love it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game!Hill Climber had me at hello. It is difficult to put down once you start. Perfect for lunch break at work.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|not as good as season 1, but it's worth checking out :)<br />am i the only one who does not like prince charming's character development?
B00DF0POXA|3.0|10 seconds into the album, I immediately thought \\"is this a NIN song?\\" which for hip-hop, is definitely different and made me very excited. The dark synths that create the soundscape for the 1st half of Yeezus remind me a lot of \\"Year Zero\\" - but with more of the minimalists feel of 808s and Heartbreak. (Seriously - go listen to \\"Survivalism\\" by NIN and tell me you don't hear the similarities to \\"On Sight\\")<br /><br />That said, I'm a bit torn on this album after several listens. I think how YOU will feel about it will be based on what you WANTED to hear from a new Kanye album. If you are looking for hit singles and slamming beats, you will be very disappointed. The song structures are random, almost no drums, and I don't think there is a single chorus on the entire album. Thats a huge departure from his last album (Dark Fantasy), which was pretty much the exact opposite. The whole album is VERY experimental. Its not bad, but it definitely lacks mainstream appeal. This is an \\"artists\\" album at its truest form.<br /><br />Given what Kanye has accomplished thus far in his career, I guess it makes sense for him to try something like this. In the perspective of his entire collection, this album is cool, but I don't think I'd want to hear him release another album like this anytime soon. He could have taken the dark synths and rapped over it with normal song structures, and it still would have been totally different than anything in hip-hop. Instead, he put out a disc that is probably going to be a little too far \\"out there\\" for most people. Of course all the \\"critics\\" will praise it so they can appear elite to the average person who \\"doesn't get it.\\"<br /><br />Only time will tell if this album is truly groundbreaking, or just random/different for its own sake. The answer is probably somewhere in the middle.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This app is so fun. It's sort of the same like cut the rope but with pudding monsters. Thanks ZeptoLab!!! :)
B00A7W29BE|3.0|According to the AppStore this is not compatible with my Galaxy Tab 2 (GT-P3113).  I can't figure out why.  It has both front and rear facing cameras and runs Android 4+.  It's essentially the same thing as my Galaxy S3 phone (SPH-L710).  Why no compatibility for the Tab 2?  Someone enlighten me.  Three stars because it only works on one of my devices, and not the one I really wanted to use.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this app It definitely requires thought and patients I personally really enjoyed this game. If you don't like puzzle games than this isn't for you
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy this game. It's good for passing time. I've gotten sick on a couple levels. Great for even you can't sleep
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is very great, especially you get to download music as video or mp3.Very great app you should download especially if you are a person who goes on YouTube slot.<br /><br />  (XOXO)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! I love the puzzles. They are entertaining and fun. Hopefully as it gets to higher levels, it gets more challenging. So far it's been pretty easy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I liked it as much as the first two books. I hope she doesn't take long with the next one. I hate not reading about Gideon and Eva.
0679805273|5.0|We purchased the book along with the mug for our Daughters graduation. We filled the front and back covers with famous quotes from Dr. Seuss and others that were significant to our family. She was very happy with her special keepsake!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it but I think it needs a update I'm so mad at Amazon I mite pop there freaking heads of and kill them.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Find it to be very accurate.  It has all the information I like to see.  I like the ability to add other locations.
6304711905|5.0|a great western classic about the old west and the ok corral great movie compare this dvd to other dvds
B000FVE3AC|5.0|Before I made the order, I've seen the reviews made by people about the watch and company. Mix reviews which does not improve confidence to would be buyers.<br /><br />Nevertheless, for the price asked for, I decided to order - if its a dud, at least I not down in the hole for much.<br /><br />When I got the package, i was thunderstruck by the size of the piece. Just looking at the construction, you would think it should be at a higher price point. The movement is good and it performs to specification. It has excellent wrist presense .....
B00004RJ71|2.0|this movie has a lot of action but is very boaring it goes on and on to nowhere zzzz zzzz
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Even though im 13 this game is fun great way to do something that doesn't need internet all the time try it :)
6304711891|5.0|this movie needs a little patiants to get going but will keep you on the edge of your seat good old classic
B0046A9MRW|5.0|Since Agatha Christie is one of my favourite authors, there is nothing I can say that will do her work justice!! She is amazing and also gives us an insight into the early 20th century Britain.  She is a first class writer and keeps her readers engrossed, never fails to satisfy.
B00005JLK1|5.0|this movie is a great movie for those who like horror and those who like sad but happy endings this is a rarity where you see a horror movie with a plot a must see
B000JMLKCG|4.0|Thomas Hardy can be a bit intense but this story is one of those that you will just keep turning the pages.  Did not disappoint
6305313687|5.0|a hard core reality check for both sides of the coin be a good guy be a bad guy and this still is a life lesson
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Lee Child has not disappointed me as yet.  Another story that keeps you reading till the end.  You cannot put it down!!!!

B0046RE5I6|5.0|Since Agatha Christie is one of my favourite authors, there is nothing I can say that will do her work justice!! She is amazing and also gives us an insight into the early 20th century Britain.  She is a first class writer and keeps her readers engrossed, never fails to satisfy.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera is the best. If you can buy a cd as a gift , almost everyone I know loves this cd.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Adding this to my collection was a plus. I love the entire series and have now got my sister hooked. Season two has been difficult to find on line and on demand unless you pay additional money to watch it. It has been well worth the purchase price.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the length of game play per session is controlled by energy. therefore you arelimited to the amount of tasks you want to complete.some may disagree, but it has you wanting to &quot;come back&quot; for more. level 5 right now &amp; I think its cool.
B00006LFGD|5.0|i really love this cd.  it has all of her older duets that i used to listen to. i forgot how good this album is!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|It's like a mix between the post-apocalyptic nature of Jericho and the zombies of Walking Dead, except with Falling Skies the zombies are aliens!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|The book contains loads of useful information, like most reviews mention. It will get you up and running (or lifting) in no time. The best thing for me is that the writer is very open to feedback, questions and actually replies to emails and reviews, like the stuff here on amazon. Great stuff!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I do have to admit, I agree with all of the negative comments already posted about this book. I REALLY like Sylvia Day and everything (until now) that I have read of hers. I think maybe she has writers block or something. This book was a disappointment. The step brother ending was a little far fetched.. but Corrine was over the top.. The mother mad at Eva.. A freelance reporter with a vendetta.. secret marriage.. now Russian mafia wearing dead mans bracelet.. the chauffeurs have more training in all these scenes and they aren't even involved? sorry.. the anal prostate massaging on an airplane was even too much. this felt like a bunch of garbage to fill in between how they were going to fulfill porn moments.and Brett would NEVER have had video of eva...let alone someone else. And her dad and mom hooking up? please.... that woman would NEVER compromise her security... never... And Tatiana would be entirely too selfish with her own career to get pregnant...I realize its fiction.. but that was all too much for one book and no closure for anything. sorry.. but wont be buying this one. Here's a good way to look at it... I can take all the sex scenes out of fsog.. and still read the book.. because there was actually something there... not so much as this third one with Sylvia..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|get it its fun me and my family plays to see who will escape first. so far wifey is ahead. my kids love it so do I. u should try to see if u can escape
B00DF0POXA|3.0|I understand making music that's different.  But too many times artists produce crappy work and try to pretend it's under the umbrella of \\"being different\\" or \\"creative\\" or \\"innovative.\\"<br />If Kanye were to release an album only singing, we'd have an overall bad dish.  Fortunately, Kanye's lyrics are still excellent, and he seems to be making strong points and expressing things that touch him personally.  But the music is crap.<br />It's not like I can't appreciate an eclectic mix of genres within one album, but can we get a good mix? If you're gonna do industrial, how about GOOD industrial?  Sounds  like the guys just offloaded the music too crappy to use on their own albums, so give it to Mr West.  Has Kanye decided to outsource the production to the lowest bidder or something?<br />But, I'm just one listener.  If this has made me passionate enough to actually write a review about how much I dislike it, then it surely will motivate others to express how much they love it.<br /><br />Kanye is at the point in his career where he can take a dump in the toilet and sell it.  This album is proof he is great.<br />I still like the lyrics in spite of the music, so 3 stars from me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So good so leading you all the way through can't wait for more of the life that eva and gideon have
0880793589|5.0|Using the Whack Pack has been fun. Clients find the exercises challenging but fun. I am able to use the Whack Pack in many different ways which is an asset.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|This game sucks u can't tilt u need to press a button and the button doesn't even work so don't get it
B000J103PC|5.0|The acting from Meryl Streep and Ann Hathaway is great . They blend together. I would like to see them in somemore movies and of course I love the clothing in this movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A great fantastic game. I would happily recommend this game to any fans of puzzle and hidden object games. Try the free version first though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and seemingly easy....few puzzles little tricky to figure out but I figured all eight fairly fast....now waiting for the rest of the levels to come
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is a GREAT game with good graphics and fun options. It has alot of fun little mini games that make it seem like your actually rescuing animals in the real world. It also has crossbreeds you can breed, and a special prize every day. Y ok u should get this app for sure!!!!!! :))
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this book. I was told it was good so I read it. I saw the movies and the are not as good as the books. I love how Katniss and Peeta get together. But I got confused when in Catching Fire you had only 24 people in the arena not 48 as you said 2 kids and 2 Victors.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I have never been more amazed by an album more than this one. this is the only album i have. ever bought. J Cole deserves recognition for this one.
B00ABXA1HI|3.0|It was free and I gave it a try.  Dis not meet my needs nor expectation for what I wanted.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. I have had no issues. Puzzle games are my favorite type of game to play. Going to play more right now!
B0070DOHQS|1.0|While it was free, it was just not what I needed/expected plus very difficult to use for anyone not computer savvy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is epic! It is a flawless app, much better than the original temple run. The best thing about this app is you can collect gems

B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love love and love this app its the best cooking app ever its totally awesome and there's tons of levels and you can level up your food and tables and chairs! this is the best app ever its so fun and awnesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003VANOFY|1.0|The audio quality is pretty good, I guess. I like that I can be cooking in the kitchen with these on, or doing chores, whatever I want to be doing moving around my living room while watching Netflix/Hulu or listening to music. I especially like that there are programmable buttons for things like pause and volume. I've only used the mic a few times for Skype while gaming, but it is nice that you can mute the mic easily.<br /><br />HOWEVER...<br /><br />90% of the time when I am using these, I am watching Netflix/Hulu on one monitor (inactive) and doing something on the other monitor (active) like a full screen game or browsing the web or doing work, but that activity is usually silent or has sound disabled intentionally so I can listen to the movie or tv show I have playing. The problem is that these headphones have an automatic and not configurable feature (which I assume is to save power, though they do this even when they are plugged in/charging) where they make a screeching warning sound and then shut off because they think you are not using them anymore. I have read about people being irritated because they are using their speakers for sound but are actively using the mic on the headset, but the mic is always picking up sound so that isn't enough to keep them from shutting off (sound needs to be playing or \\"you're not using them\\"). However, the problem I have, there is actually sound coming through the headset, just not from the active program, which I guess is \\"close enough\\" because the headset shuts off every few minutes. So not only am I interrupted constantly, but I have to choose between clicking out of my game (luckily, windowed mode...) at inopportune times, or missing chunks of my show and having to queue backward to catch what my headphones muted.<br /><br />THIS IS THE MOST IRRITATING THING.<br /><br />I want to just have Netflix auto-playing episodes of some show or another while I am doing something else; I multitask, okay, and it cannot the minorityof people who do this. I imagine anyone who is instead JUST listening to music is even MORE irritated because no one just sits with their music player in focus, unless they are some tween or stoner with nothing better to do than sit in awe at the wonder of technology, watching Windows Media Player's visual effects like it's 1999 and their internet is too slow to stream video.<br /><br />The fact that this is not configurable is the most retarded part of the whole thing. It would be like not being allowed to disable the power-saver/screen-saver on your OS. Oh, you were watching that? Too bad! Why do you live in an apartment and care to not disturb your neighbors like a poor and thoughtful person? Maybe you shouldn't have spent so much money on these headphones!<br /><br />After some Googling, I have found that this has been a common complaint for YEARS. Logitech has NOT FIXED THIS in all that time. It should be an easy software/firmware fix, but they have not done anything about it.<br /><br />I had these headphones for too long before realizing this problem, unfortunately. My advice? Buy some headphones that do not auto-shut-off \\"to save power\\" or at least give you the option...
B00D2CYU2W|2.0|Movie was well-written and lavish. But Michael Douglas was, well...Michael Douglas. His performance ran the gamut from glimpses of a nearly-believable flamboyant gay man to his typical movie character. Unfortunately, Michael Douglas is a very masculine man, and so when he was being every other character he has played, Liberace was nowhere in sight. His steely eyes, calculated line delivery, and even his distinctive (masculine, confident) way of walking popped out constantly, and, for me, he lost all credibility as Liberace. It's possible I am biased since I am a fan of his and have seen all of his movies so I could not possibly be taken in by this performance. Or, I admit, it could be because he has a somewhat limited acting range and has just never left his zone. At any rate, his performance prevented me from really getting into the movie. As for Matt Damon, he slid seamlessly into the Thorson role (with no resemblence to his many other characters), but he is just too old for it and his age showed in some shots. If you are not familiar with either of these actors, you might enjoy the story.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I love this movie! great fantasy movie. almost like a prelude to lord of the rings or hobbit. would definitely recommend it
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|disapointing.  The producers can alway suck you into one last try.  Loved all the other die hard movies.<br />But this one left me yawning.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00D6BN9NK A Good Day to Die Hard]]
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Another great classic movie! Can't beat this feel good adventure. Never missed this movie when it was on as a kid
B004WR125O|4.0|I don't really use any of the internet enabled functions, but I do love the Android App remote functions it provides.  My home theater is in a carpeted room that generates a lot of static electricity, so I try to never directly touch the receiver (TX-NR717) in fear of generating a charge.  The android app is very responsive and so far has worked great (though make sure you update your firmware prior to plugging it in).
B00BPXKWGS|4.0|I've been a fan of R.E.M. since their first albums. I've purchased their expanded versions of other CD's.  All, including this one, have been very good - I would have preferred demo's or outtakes to live performance.  Nevertheless, this is a nice update to the original release.
B009LGO88E|5.0|This is vital for Monster Hunter Tri Ultimate. It provides an advantage over using the stupid built in camera to move in water.
B005JS7VTQ|3.0|This is a great price for anyone looking to dig deep into the Doobie Brothers catalog.  While many of their albums are uneven, you will find some gems here that are not a part of any greatest hits collection.  I have several of these Original Album series and they have proved to be a good value. NOTE: these sets are focused on the Music; no bonus tracks, no elaborate liner notes.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Absolutely loved it, only problem was I could not put it down just had to finish it.  Already reading another Kate Morton novel :)
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci is one of my favorite authors and did not let me down with this one.  Looking forward to the follow up
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it's a fun game but I think it should have more options.  I think things shouldn't be so expensive, and you don't have to unlock stable tasks and you should not have to wait to do something like groom because a little. extra never hurts.  I also think you should be able to train any time too.all food should give at least a little of everything.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is great if you only have a few minutes or if you have hours. the kids and I compete with scores and coins, and its fun to upgrade to different jetpacks and features.
0765365278|4.0|The last 150 pages are unbelievable! The rest is better than average. Can't wait for the next one to be released!
0004704754|4.0|I had read all of Shakespeare's works many years ago, but after reading and reviewing the book, How to Teach Shakespeare to your children, I decided to again visit all of material written by the great Bard.  This giant 1433 page tomb begins with a biography of Shakespeare written by Germaine Greer, followed by the Shakespeare's theatre by Anthomy Burgess and two introductions;  one of them written by Alec Yearling and one written in for the 1951 edition of this book by Peter Alexander.<br /><br />This volume contains all the plays sonnets and poems written by William Shakespeare.  Some of the more popular plays in this selection include the following:  The Tempest, The Merry Wives of Windsor, The Comedy of Errors, Much Ado About Nothing, A Midsummer-Nights Dream, The Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, The Taming of the Shrew, The Winter's Tale, King John, King Richard the second, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra.  The Sonnets and Poems in this volume include:  Venus and Adonis, the Rape of Lucrece, Sonnets, A Lover's Complaint, The Passionate Pilgrim and the Phoenx and Turtle.  This text also has a special transcript by Sir Walter Greg of Shakespeare's contribution to Sir thomas More.  There is also a helpful glossary and a bibliography section in this huge text.<br /><br />In conclusion, the only reason I did not give this great book five stars is because my old eyes had some trouble reading the small print, even with my reading glasses on; however, those with the eyes of youth will find this an excellent volume of the complete works of William Shakespeare.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author:  Haiku Moments:  How to read, write and enjoy haiku)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so fun but can be very addictive watch out so much better than other games thank you enjoy
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Great Product. Havent watched them yet as I saw on tv. But wanted my copy forever. I love this show!! It is a must watch for everyone!!!
B00631VJIC|5.0|I'm really glad to discover the collection songs of my favorite TV series. We find the beautiful songs that made ​​us dream during seasons 1-4.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I really thing Matthew McConaughey always does an excellent job.  I would definitely recommend this movie and Matthew McConaughey's ability!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Outstanding.  Argo may have won the best picture oscar but this one was a real hoot for entertainment and IMO the best of the year.  Lawrence (best actress), Cooper, DeNiro et al were all great.  Couldn't stop laughing and enjoyed the romantic aspect of two very flawed individuals getting together and on each other's case unmercifully.  Typical Philadelphia which must be the Hebrew word for rude.  One of the very few films I watch repeatedly.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was the type of game I was looking for. Great story, graphics and so far length of game.  Not yet finished but I am enjoying all the exploration and discoveries I've come across. Highly recommend.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have found nothing to complain about.  I really like it.  I have used it to bid and purchase with no issues at all.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|colornote note pad notes is the most effective of the note keeping and calendar based apps I have tried.  It is reasonably intuitive and therefore quick to learn.  Importantly your notes are easy to find if and when you need to.  most of all i like the automatic reminder on the correct date.  I am quickly learning to pay attention to the reminder when i turn on my device.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This is an album like 808's that challenges your love for Kanye West. If you are expecting pop hooks and radio tracks, move on....This is not the album for you. If you want something that will challenge your ear drums, bring the energy, make you laugh, make you think, make you go \\"WTF was Kanye thinking\\", buy this album! This is what mainstream Hip-Hop needs. An album that isn't the same old tired features, producers and song choices. Kanye is his own genre, he is the Prince of Hip-Hop. He creates his own lane and this is why I give this album, 5 stars.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are Black Skinhead, New Slaves, I'm in It, Hold My Liquor, Blood on the Leaves, I Am a God, Send It Up, and Bound 2.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for. Fit's nicely in my car without any bulk. Priced fairly for a well made charger.
B005LJETYI|4.0|This title was surprising in that despite being military SF (genre not personal style) the book has a narrative style that draws the reader into the story. The main character dies over and over again in combat against the alien Mimics. Groundhog Day! As he attempts to figure out why we also learn about the American elite soldier Rita who suffered similar circumstances early in her combat career. Both find each other, compare notes, and proceed to find a way out of the time loop and destroy the invaders. Tom Cruise is currently making an adaption of this book, film to be released early 2014. The book will definitely be more noticeable at bookstores and deserves to be read. Quick read as little over 200 pages in print, well worth the $6 on kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Five stars this book keeps u in it and now I'm off to read mocking Jay!!! I say amazing book!!!
0802473156|5.0|This book is perfect for single people and those in committed relationships! I looked at my personal love requirements completely different after finishing this quick read.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This game is one of my games I just play when I'm bored. It's pretty good though. I would have rated it with five stars but you have to lay for stuff in the game  or buy the full version. Also you only have one girl to do all your makeover on. The rest of the girls have to be bought. But it's free so your not really wasting money so get it
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was bummed about the new s4 not having text predict and so that I am grateful for Swift. I save so much time!
B004JK61K0|4.0|Pros:<br />-easy setup (practically no geek information needed)<br />- clean, simple interface<br />- easy to use<br />Cons:<br />- Could use some User interface improvements (eg. select multiple entries for operations) *<br />- could have local list of contacts (my tablet is hooked to Google account, but my pop-mail is different - I'd like to not have to mix the two sets of contacts)<br /><br />*Correction - I found this feature... my bad.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Would highly recommend this album if you like blues but don't mind a little rock and country mixed in. Brittany Howard's voice reminds me of Janis Joplin's. The first song, &#34;Hold On,&#34; has become our carpool morning commute theme song.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Its fun but the controls are hard to control. I would recommend it to people who like cars. Otherwise its fun.
B004CHURRS|5.0|This CD is a must if you love Handel - and Dessay. It's a wonderful compilation of arias from Giulio Cesare masterfully sang by Dessay.
0811879542|5.0|My two-year-old twin granddaughters could not get enough of this book!  It is interactive, and teaches casue-and-effect in a toddler-friendly way.  Love this book!!
B005I0DV4Y|5.0|Inspiring movie for women and girls of all ages. Strong female lead as she surmounts all the limitations imposed on girls and women in every country including North America. A shining light of persevering and succeeding through believing in oneself despite no one else believing in you. Great filming and awesome script. Highly recommended.
B0047SF41G|3.0|This move would not be suitable for children because of the very bad language. I don't understand why that is necessary for a good movie. I wish the actors would stand up against it. Talent should be enough.
0061122416|5.0|This book ultimately changed my life. If you ever asked for instructions to life... This book is it trust me!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was an addicting game. Some levels took me a while to catch on but I loved it. Wish there were more levels.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|Well developed plot and characters.  The story makes sense and is suspensefull. A good read. Keeps you engaged and guessing.
0425166805|4.0|A book that's not to be miss if you love watching Ancient Aliens the Series. Than read where its all begin.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Despite what many reviewers have said about it being boring for kids, my young children loved this movie and it held their attention through to the end.<br />Here's what I liked:<br />  A great prequel with lots if set ups in the story line and explanations for things in The Wizard of Oz<br />  The backstory for the witches was really well thought out<br />  Not too many scary scenes (the flying baboons were a little frightening, but made minimum appearances)<br />  The transition from black and white to color was done really well, and was a fun throw back to the original<br />  The Wizard's small moment of redemption in China Town was a nice little sidestep<br />  A good ending that wrapped up nicely and was a good lead in to the original<br />  Loved Zach Braff as the voice of Finley<br />  Not too many love scenes (although there is a bit of innuendo in the beginning, and the wizard is obviously a player)<br />  No vulgar language<br />  No \\"gross out\\" humor<br />Here's what I wasn't crazy about:<br />  James Franco, while likable and human most of the time,  suffered moments of serious overacting and delivered<br />  a lot of his lines with a stiff kind of irony that almost came across as if he didn't want to say them<br />  Mila Kunis just felt like a weird choice for the wicked witch, and didnt really come across as scary or threatening<br />  Way too much CGI, it would have been nice to have some real backgrounds and realistic special effects
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging :) I would recommend this game to friends. Dec keeps u busy on a care ride. Plus u can get the whole family involved if u wanted :)
B00DF0POXA|4.0|There is much backlash in the comment section of Pitchfork's Facebook, announcing their 9.5/10 review of Yeezus (stupid name, I admit). A lot of the talk is about the similarities in beats/production between Yeezus and Death Grips, but first off let let me say that Death Grips influence is slow growing, considering that this is the first mainstream artist to take notes from their breakthroughs, when their sound has the potential to change the musical timeline on the level of a group like Nirvana (minus the martyr, plus the technology). That said, I don't think the production is at all like Death Grips or EL-P, although it does strike in the vein of industrial-rap, a sub-genre which EL-P helped to pioneer around a decade ago, and Death Grips helped to change and evolve. No one is mentioning the similarities to Sleigh Bells production (which they slightly tried to crawl out from under on their second album), but there are several artists who are, and/or have been, experimenting with making the 808 sound like the speaker is blown by layering it with robust synthesizers, distortion, and/or compression.<br /><br />Kanye has always been good about keeping a finger on the pulse, or biting the latest trends, based on recommendations of his production team. But he also helps, like any good artist/producer, to condense his influences and the trends of the moment, so we can get over them a little and move on. Personally I think the Death Grips connection that everyone is making does have some ground to stand on, but it's miss-aimed, because Death Grips took strong influence from Rick Rubin, so why can't the opposite be acceptable as well. Surely Rubin has been listening to all these acts I mentioned, and you cannot undo what any of these previously mentioned groups have done. Kanye brought Rick Rubin like 3 hours of unorganized fragments of songs that Rubin had to congeal, sharpen, and focus. So even if Kanye made all the influences and reference points crystal clear, Rick had only 4 weeks to hone all that madness, without the vocals even recorded, and then Kanye came in and laid the vocals in a week. So, the lyrics are supposed to sound immediate like freestyles and not over-cooked suites like his last album, or indulgent emotional dirges like his break-up album before that. Rubin had to act quickly, and I feel like the blown-out direction of the album had to be at least partly the Rubin influence.<br /><br />I also want to address this thing people often say that rappers brag too much. That's like saying rock should be softer. It might be true, but it's a gross oversight of the entire history of the genre, and the rhetorical context of this kind of writing. It is, by fundamental design, an ornate form of rhythmic bragging, even if you are listing to 90's conscious rap, Beastie Boys, or whatever. Fundamentally, storytelling elements of rap came later.<br /><br />This is the angry Kanye; it's designed to sound raw and immediate, following his previous album of obsessive epic suites, and his more melodic break-up album before that. If nothing else, he at least clearly sets himself apart from both what Jay-Z did with Rick Rubin (which was merely an homage to Rubin's past work), as well as what Lil Wayne did with rock, and then did with rock again even weaker, and then did with rock a 3rd time even weaker and more clich&eacute; than the other two. Instead, Kanye did what he always does, which is to keep his ear to the street and try to stake historical claim to threads of ideas running through music at any given time. If you hate the vocoder/talkbox/auto-tune/pitch-correct sound, don't worry, I have the feeling he is only doing it long enough to make us stop calling it \\"T-Pain voice.\\"<br /><br />I like this album musically, despite the fact that the styles brought together here were not invented here. I like NIN, Death Grips, EL-P and most of the stuff you could compare this to, because I accept the fact that the pioneers seldom get recognized. NIN were inspired by Skinny Puppy, EL-P by The Bomb Squad, and even Death Grips were inspired by others like Rubberroom, Atari Teenage Riot, Dalek, etc. This is a good album by a hot-headed dude who has thouroughly proven he is a douchebag, but he is no Chris Brown, regardless how many Kardashians he impregnates. In the history of angry rap, Kanye may not own the lineage at all, but he is on the timeline now, and in the future someone will steal his ideas, because he will be too old to be remembered by the next crop of young fans.IN were inspired by Skinny Puppy, EL-P by The Bomb Squad, and even Death Grips were inspired by others like Rubberroom, Atari Teenage Riot, Dalek, etc. This is a good album by a hot-headed dude who has thouroughly proven he is a douchebag, but he is no Chris Brown, regardless how many Kardashians he impregnates.

B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Frontline D-day commando is ok by me!  For the price. Another game that wants cash for upgrades . Fun to play not to hard. Not to easy.
B00B7ERH04|2.0|I do not think you should get this. Try Kindle Fire Camera Video HD (Kindle Tablet Edition) !!! So much better :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this is alsome cool it helps me now the weather because I go out everyday and I really needed to know the weather for 10 days and more. I will remember it for the rest of my life
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I am very pleased with finding this game.  I have been looking for this type of game for a very long time.  I am enjoying it very much, although still on the challenging difficulty. Keep up the good work! :)
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I was going to wait until they released all three films in a boxed set, but I couldn't wait! So I decided to buy the theatrical version and leave the box for the extended ones. What I like about this package is that you get the 3D and 2D versions both in blu-ray, so if you don't have a 3D system, you can still watch it in glorious HD until you can buy the other.<br />The 3D version comes in two discs (like \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"), while the flat version is only in one, which is great because you don't have to be switching discs to watch the whole movie.<br />The quality of both the video and sound is superb!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I think this one came first, but it's very similar to Downton Abbey in tone. The most interesting part is the setting, in pre-WWII England. The characters interact with various political figures from history, and the personal stories keep it from being a historical documentary. Highly recommended.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|My girlfriend told me about this book and from the name it, it seemed like just another self help book. I initially had zero desire to read it. As she read through it she continued to tell me about these extremely interesting facts and stories that she herself had just read in this book. I succumbed to her recommendations and starting reading it. Immediately I was entranced into the book. It doesn't just list bullet points, it opens your eyes to the world of habit through captivating stories. Not only did I learn a ton from this book, I enjoyed the hell of it too. Read the first chapter, I guarantee you won't put it down.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This was a solid 4 stars for me up through the first 3/4 of the novel.  By the end, I had to up it to 5.  Why?  Holistically, it's unique, tells a great story of struggle, slow triumph, mystery, adventure.<br /><br />It's no masterpiece, but it's in the top 20% of anything I've ever read in this genre, which is a pretty fair bit.<br /><br />As a recent comparison, I'd probably put Michael Sullivan's Riyria Chronicles a notch above these.  But Sanderson's originality in the world he created is superb.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|What can I say?  I like all of Michael Connelly's stories.  His plots and characters are complex and hold my interest.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|i loved the graphics and the scenery it was beautiful the location was awesome I think it went a little overboard with the andy serkis scene it was to long also I didn't understand about the little wizard where even though I thought he was cute with his little bunnies I didn't get what his part actually was and what was up with the dragon and I didn't get how the ring actually played a part of this movie because when you watch lord of the rings it doesn't mention dragons or that the ring was connected to muldor whatever the name is I will watch the rest of the hobbits and hope that they are better than this one if I had went to the movies to see the hobbit I would have been very disappointed because I love lord of the rings so much and the hobbit to me had know connection or the dwarfs I didn't get but I will be watching
1594202842|3.0|I read this book as soon as I got it, that was three years ago. I saw her as a mother with nothing but achieving perfection on her mind not only for herself but for her daughters and raising them with an iron-fist. I only liked one chapter and that was named \\"Rebellion\\" I believe. I wouldn't really recommend others this book. Left me with an odd/mixed-up feeling after I was done reading it. Not a good feeling that is.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Now I enjoy X-Men, Spider-Man, Iron Man and all of the Avengers, but for me they don't compare to Batman and Superman. In fact, after Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, I would rank Man of Steel as the second best of all the recent comic book turned movies. I knew going in that the critics were nearly 50/50 on the good and bad side of the fence, so my expectations might have been lowered enough to prepare for the worst and surprised when it didn't happen.<br /><br />The story begins with the same old origin of Superman, but there are enough little changes in the script and nice visual touches to make it seem fresh. As expected, the CGI FX and Hans Zimmer's score are stunning throughout.<br /><br />Henry Cavill makes for a good and believable Superman and Michael Shannon plays a memorable villain in General Zod. Russell Crowe really surprised me with a strong emotional turn as Jor-El. He is a good actor, but his work of late has been rather weak. I normally can't stand the character of Lois Lane, but I like her here, so that is saying something about Amy Adams.<br /><br />It's not perfect of course. The narrative did not always gel, jumping around too often, and it ran for maybe 15 minutes too long.<br /><br />I saw it in digital 2-D due to all the bad IMAX and 3-D reviews. It cut my ticket price in half and I didn't feel like I missed out. Also, my full theater clapped and cheered loudly when it was over. I had not heard a reaction like that in a long time.<br /><br />With the 129 million dollar opening weekend, I feel this is but the first film of a trilogy that will probably get even better now that the foundation has been laid down.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game, starts off very simple and easy to solve but gets more and more difficult as you go along. Keeps the brain working to make sure colors  match and no pipes intersect.Great for all ages and best of all it's free.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|The High Def portion of the streaming service leaves a lot to be desired. The audio stream is delivered in just 2 channels, stereo. The video stream seems well under 1080p. This is not even close to bluray quality.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|Great stuff. Outstanding script, production and performances. Segments are loosely joined, but not all music can be a symphony. Tom Hanks is ever present. It pushes credibility a bit to see him assume so many guises in one film. Alternately he could have focused on a couple of characters; nonetheless he is a convincing  presence.<br /><br />Clearly--in this viewer's mind--the writers were informed by the Buddhist concept pratitya-samutpada, that nothing exists independently of other things. It would have been good to have seen this credited, but this is small beer. Cloud Atlas is a worthwhile film.
B008NW67E0|4.0|some of the songs on this cd are famous and for a reason, this band plays great together and their style of music is not exactly like any other band out there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is good. Me and my brother love playing together. And finally the update is here. It is so much fun. And if you rated one star you are not bright at all.
B00932AA5G|5.0|All I can say is: If you're on the fence abut this, just get it!!<br /><br />I read that they made this film for the same cost as a TV movie. Incredible!! Great casting, music, editing, direction, script, and cinematography! One of the best films I've seen in the last few years. There were many twists and turns that were amazing, so I don't want to give anything away. I'll just say that there are several set pieces that are just stellar: the scenes with the dog, the outhouse scene, the car and truck scene, the male/female fight scene, etc., etc. I had high expectations going into this and this film surpassed them all!!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I Don't know how to dj. Regardless, this is a cool app that makes me feel like i know how to =))
B000F8O35U|4.0|One of my daughter's favorites.<br />She enjoyed this movie so much when she was a child.<br />I have decided to give &#34;her daughter&#34; the  movie also.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I lobe how the whole story is like at first Greg is good then bad then good. I read this whole book in two days and I'm glad I used this money to buy this nook. I suggest this book for all ages, it's funny and makes you want to read this book until the end. The pictures are even really good, they make the the story have interest and show you what you are reading. You don't get this kind of fun in some chapter books but in this one you do. I look forward to reading the book of diary of a wimpy kid and I hope you do to.<br />Bye
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|It is very different and maybe not for everyone but I could listen to her music anytime!<br />I listen to it at the gym, in the car, when I am on the computer and never tire of her. I love her songs and her lyrics are pure poetry in some songs. Like I said though, she probably isn't for everyone.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|It is a good game better than front line commando it's cool how you can fight like in World War 2
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie brought forth a heartfelt message and everyone could learn and be inspired to strive<br />to do and be the best we can in our own lives and the lives of family, friends and others.<br /><br />This movie had drama, laughter, tears, hope, and many learning experiences.  It showed the<br />important role the father has in the home and in the lives of his children.  Thumbs up!
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|Yes, it's a lot like classic Sabbath. There's even a song (Zeitgeist) that sounds like part 2 of Planet Caravan. But really, that's what I was hoping for. This is pure, unadulterated Sabbath.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Amazing and a really good game for free. Really impressed, good graphics, and it shows dragons in their habitats in they best way possible.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series! And I think Hollywood needs to pick up on these books - they would make great movies!
B008B1BL4E|5.0|Almost a page turner (admittedly you have to be an ardent fan of history). This is writing at it's best. Bracing action, vivid characters, momentous world events.
B008YI99IE|3.0|The story line for this third installment in the Jurassic Park franchise is a bit forced.  It is still a fun movie with dinosaurs popping out and attacking people.  But, as is the formula for a third action/adventure movie, the monsters have to get smarter.  The way this happens is a bit of a departure from the ideas of the previous two films.  And, while it was fun to see dinosaurs that had not been in the other two films, I find it hard to believe that a hundred people who explored the island in the previous film, wouldn't have found any evidence of these new creatures.
193700788X|1.0|I'm just going to make this short and (not) sweet.  I'm not sure who CH hates more, her readers or her characters? We may have been equally disrespected. Following in the trend of the last couple of books in this series, this book is probably one of the worst I've read in a good long while.  I'm only thankful I didn't buy it.  This was nothing more than phoned-in dribble.  As with the last two, story was boring, repetitive, and pretty out of character with anything the main (and supporting) characters had done in the past.  I've read *bad* fan fiction that was better thought out and composed.  Are we certain that DEA wasn't ghost-written by someone who has only read a brief synopsis of the previous books?  Now that I am (thankfully) done with this series I will: 1) mourn for what the books used to be; 2) grudgingly put up with True Blood; and 3) figure out what to do with this copy of DEA after its owner made it painfully clear that she never wants to see it again.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I have enjoyed playing the board game version of this and if you haven't it's an awesome game and can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/Z-Man-Games-78000ZMG-Carcassonne-Basic/dp/B008ULAMSG/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1371568100&sr=1-1&keywords=carcassonne.<br /><br />The computer players are surprisingly skilled and the basic elements of the game, including the best one, you make the game board, remain.  Great diversion.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|It show me a different person than I thought he was. I would make this a fine addition to the Beatles Anthology.
B000IZXR7U|3.0|I had never seen Mad Max before, but I was working on a dystopian short story and I thought it would help put me in the mood to write it.  I think as a watcher of more current action movies, I expected less build up and more action, but that is a result of the time the movie was made, I think.  The villains were a bit cartoonish in their evilness, but at the same time brutal in their attacks.  I also found the interactions between the police hard to follow.  I am unsure if I'll finish the series, we'll see.
B000085RPU|2.0|I would advise anyone to be careful about the versions that you buy. The Region 2 version won't play in American DVD players and only on your computer.
B008YI9CWW|4.0|I love Jurassic Park, and re-watch it often.  It reminds me of seeing it in the theater as a kid.  This sequel, loosely based on the novel, is still great fun, like the original.  The story works well, for the most part.  I don't want to give any spoilers, so I'll stop there.  If you're expecting a film that is as amazing as the original, you'll be disappointed, but if you are just expecting a great story and to be entertained, you'll be happy.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The wittiest writing I've read these past two weeks was your review! At this point the story is so fractured and disjointed, I wonder if Martin knows where it's going. Even Dickens's volumeous stories continued to connect his characters, subplots and cliffhangers with one end in mind. Hope the series redeems itself!

B00DF0POXA|4.0|Let's start with the obvious: Most fans of Late Registration and even Dark Fantasy are gonna hate this thing. It's noisy, it's ugly, and even the singles aren't really single material---with the possible exception of Bound2. Admittedly, I have mixed feelings about Kanye's early albums, and I actually regard this one as the best of Mr. West. But it's not because I love noisy clatter and hate more soulful takes on hip hop (I like both). Other reviews here, and the track samples, can clue you in on what exactly the album sounds like.* You'll know within a few seconds of each sample whether or not you think you might be able to stomach it. But regardless of your reaction to those sounds, I want to make a case for the album. Without focusing too much on the music itself, let me try to walk you through why I think that this is worth your time.<br /><br />Yeezus is, more than any other Kanye album, a work of confusion, contradiction, and deep ambivalence. In some ways it's akin to the books of Bret Easton Elis, the comics of R. Crumb, and the films of Takashi Miike. All of these artists simultaneously critique and exploit a shortcoming or fetish of theirs. In the case of Yeezus, it's two things: Kanye's obsession with status, and his attitude toward women. The critique comes out in the black power motifs throughout the album. Most explicit is the New Slaves argument, which depicts black culture today as shackled both by materialism itself, and by the false dream that money can buy respect among the powerful white elite.<br /><br />But it's not presently quite so cleanly. He also indulges in the very things he critiques, obsessing over success and status, turning himself into a caricature of the angry oversexed \\"black buck\\" (an old racist term) that he assumes the wealthy elites regard him as. This is forged with his own very real insecurities about women, which were likely heightened by his role as a future father. In some of these respects, the album is close in theme to Nirvana's \\"In Utero,\\" where a nervous father-to-be spews all of his anxiety into a sonic and semantic bile on record. It's a little different in that Kanye's fear of women also interacts with his anxieties about power and status. What results is this chaotic mishmash of misogyny as casual callousness, sincere venting, and exaggerated political \\"ressentiment.\\"<br /><br />One thing that makes the album interesting beyond pure visceral energy is the bald juxtaposition of this moral ugliness against some higher moral sentiment. Throughout, you get slogans taken from the Black Power movement turned into lewd references (\\"....like the civil rights sign\\"), you get black self love (\\"I am a God\\") followed by knowingly infantile hostility (\\"Hurry up with my damn croissants!\\"). And, in Blood on the Leaves, you get Nina Simone's chilling voice from Strange Fruit layered on top of some paranoid rant about relationships. The main intended thrust of that song is to continue the idea of New Slaves: that black culture is trapped in a meaningless or sad cycle. But half of the power of the song was likely not even intended by Kanye. It's significant that he chose Nina's version of Strange Fruit over Billie's more famous one. While Billie voiced a haunting resignation, Nina's version was dripping with anger and disgust. In some ways the claustrophobia of the narrator's account is heightened by the drama of the samples, but the other effect is one of dark irony: his affair is rendered banal by the real injustices and atrocities that Simone's voice brings to mind. \\"Is this what we suffered and died for?\\" the ghosts of the Old Slaves seem to say in indignation.<br /><br />The feelings conjured up here are best left vented rather than rhetorically articulated. Kanye's attempts to articulate his ideas in recent interviews aren't nearly as successful as what's on here. Despite its unsavory components, I think Yeezus is a bold and unflinching exploration of contradicting emotions. The real fears of a successful black man, and of a father to be, set up against his knowledge of the past and his place within it. There's a lot on here that's troubling, but at least Kanye's actually trying to wrestle with and make sense of these demons, rather than just sell misogyny as a catchy single like most MCs today. He's not a coherent thinker, but I think that actually helps him as an artist, because his real strength is in evoking a realistically messy, confused state of mind.<br /><br />It's not something you put on to cheer yourself up after a hard day of work, it's not an album for chilling with friends, it's a journey into some dark territory of the human psyche. It takes patience and a strong stomach, but I think it's well worth the effort.<br /><br />**One note about the music: Yeezus is definitely influenced by noisy underground rap like Death Grips' No Love Deep Web. But that's not the same thing as saying that Yeezus is \\"merely\\" a copy of DG. Let's not play that \\"who did it first\\" purity test, because everyone loses (I'm sure some kids out there are claiming that Death Grips just wants to be Dalek). Ready to Die was clearly the product of a post-Wu Tang New York scene, but it stands on its own as a masterpiece to rival 36 Chambers. Bowie copied the Velvet Underground in the 70's, but they're both awesome. Similarly, Ye was probably listening to some Death Grips, but they're different beasts. In fact, I prefer Ye's messier take over DG's more strategic assault.**ars of a successful black man, and of a father to be, set up against his knowledge of the past and his place within it.

B00BHJ0MY2|5.0|If you've never heard Malian singer-songwriter Rokia Traore, definitely check her out. Her earlier work (especially 98's Mounessa) blended traditional Malian instruments in subtly unconventional ways, and each successive album has found Rokia ever more adventurous in her approach. \\"Beautiful Africa\\" is no exception. Unlike the rest, this one can rightly be described as a Rock album, with electric guitar and solid drumming providing a somewhat aggressive backbone to Rokia's otherwise delicate, hypnotic songs. The tracks here are consistently excellent, although it is admittedly a highlight to hear the Rokia's typically soft vocals grow downright fiery in songs like \\"Kouma\\" and the title track. Still, the lighter moments are wonderful as well, such as the grooving \\"Ka Moun Ke\\" and closer \\"Sarama.\\"<br /><br />One of the best albums I've heard this year, though listeners familiar with Rokia's talent shouldn't be surprised at this. Hopefully it will get the attention it deserves.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00BBW16HW|5.0|I loved this movie.  I usually don't like subtitled movies but this was easy to follow.  It was funny, serious, and overall a great movie.  The best part was the fact that it was based on a true story. Of course, it was hard to tell which parts were embelished but not all true stories can be all entertaining. Overall,  definitely worth watching!
B00C2IN76C|1.0|This movie was just another Snyder flop, I'm not sure why they keep giving him the helm of big movies...he throws in a bunch of special effects and sex scenes and leaves out that emotion/connection that the audience needs to be drawn in. Without that why should we even care what happens to the superheros? As we've now seen with Man of Steel, 300, and Sucker Punch, he adds in a bunch of flash backs and goes off on random tangents that just confuse the audience. Sure some of the special effects are cool, but they only get you so far. If he actually put time into capturing emotion and adding things in that make the audience care then I think he could actually make some good films, but right now I feel like he should be down on the TV show level. He should take notes from David Goyer and Christopher Nolan, they know how to add heart to a film! Definitely not worth the purchase! Spend your time doing something else, you won't regret it!
B00CWVFZ8W|4.0|Beautiful creatures is reminiscent of Twilight in that the characters are young and the whole story is a whimsical romance.  The main character Lena is a better actress than Kristen Stewart ten times over which makes it more enjoyable.  Overall I thought it was cute and compelling at times.  I look forward to reading all of the books and for the next movie to come out in the series (if they continue with it).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a really cool game one of my favorits that need to make a sub way surfer 2 or something all I can say is awesome
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like this but the adds are horrible.Also it is hard to get bombs and new Colors and other stuff.It is very fun and is a great wag to get artistic.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good distraction with a twenty word m I minimum for opinions. So I will type a few more words.my kids did enjoy the game and it was easy enough to help them out when they got stuck.
B004LWZW24|5.0|Such a great movie. Just got it in the mail and everything looked great. No scratches. DVD box looks great. GREAT BUY!
B00362DRPY|5.0|Excellent quality. Shipping materials perfect to avoid any problem with the record. Sound quality = CD. Also the additional record included as bonus is great
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautiful story you will never forget.  Lovely, sometimes unusual writing style.  Characters who become friends with some you hope to be emulate.  Don't skip ahead or miss a word of this powerful book.
B005GPFDQK|3.0|I did not realize it came with two discs. Half the songs in each. That makes it more complex to listen the complete record
B003VANOFY|4.0|In particular the on/off button on the headphones doesn't really work. You press it and it may or may not come on/turn off. Its particularly bad if you want to turn it on while charging.<br /><br />Still, they provide good sound and are great when you want to listen to music and/or podcasts without being chained to your computer. I put on a podcast check my e-mail, mow the lawn, do some baking, change the laundry without disturbing the rest of the people in the house. I've even wandered about and stayed on skype calls.<br /><br />Very nice functionality, but like I said they can be a bit frustrating.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|Very timely processed and great album.  The primary CD is the main feature in this set and that's what I care about since that's a classic.  Bonus CD's were for hard core Fleetwood fans, e.g., a concert setting with a couple additional songs, if that appeals to you. Along with interviews what, etc.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|But so far so good. The main problem is graphics for me. Otherwise it's a solid game. Cou be smoother and more complex stages tho
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's fun. I like that it has more vehicles to chose from and that they have upgrades. You should try it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Normally I am very lucky about stuff. Games, Hotels, Restaurants, you name it, but I think this Game is great quality! I highly recommend this Game!  I just think it should be free though. Well, besides the price I think it's well worth it!
B000002JS6|4.0|As with most AC/DC CDs, there are some great, head banging tunes. They must be taken in brief doses however as the tunes and message are all pretty much the same.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book is well researched, well documented,and well argued. It certainly presents a compelling and convincing argument against the conventional \\"wisdom\\"that calories in/calories out is a way to lose weight and maintain this weight loss. As a physician I enjoyed reading the clear explanation of fat metabolism...putting together pieces I have been contemplating over the last two decades. My metabolism was destroyed by following a low fat/ high carbohydrate diet 20 years ago at the suggestion of a \\"friend\\" ( since then I have learned a lot about friends and unsolicited advice, but that is another subject...) I am still working to undo this damage.<br />This  book gives me the tools to really address this  issuefor myself and my patients.
B00000DG1R|4.0|During the 80's, you couldn't turn the radio &#34;dial&#34; without hearing one of their songs. They are just classic 80's dance music.
1781162646|3.0|Not sure as the reviews go it was \\"stunning\\" or \\"scary\\" but it was pretty good.  This is only my second Stephen King book.  One of my all time favorite books is 11/22/63.  Joyland got very good after about 130 pages.  It was a sweet book and yes I see this one becoming a movie at some point.  I have been reading a lot of \\"dogs\\" lately so I would recommend Joyland.
B00008BXJG|3.0|As with most AC/DC CDs, there are some great, head banging tunes. They must be taken in brief doses however as the tunes and message are all pretty much the same.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|I've had sort of a love/hate relationship with Kanye.  I definitely think he's a terrible person (from what we've seen).  We've seen him throw tantrums in front of the world, apologize, and do it again...over, and over again.  However, when it comes to his music, I really do think he's one of the best producers in the game.  There are people out there that will praise whatever this man does...I am not one of them.<br /><br />To me, Graduation was his pinnacle.  I know that a lot of people think My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is his best (and don't get me wrong, I really love that album as well), but Graduation surprised me and entranced me.  I liked College Dropout and Late Registration but didn't love them, and Graduation really put Kanye on the map for me.  He kind of lost me with most of 808's, but one misstep in his catalogue is expected for any artist.<br /><br />I have that same love/hate relationship with Yeezus.  Clearly, Kanye has gone in a different direction, focusing less on soul inspired beats and more on electronic sounds.  This kicks in immediately with On Sight, which is nearly unlistenable, aside from the hidden sample in the middle of the song.  When I heard that Daft Punk would be producing a few tracks on this album, I was excited...but I wasn't looking for this.<br /><br />Kanye's soul influences show through on the highlight of the album, Bound 2.  It's a fantastic song, among the best I've heard from Kanye for a long while.<br /><br />Some of his lyrics on this album are awful...just awful.  Like, Lil' Wayne caliber lyrics.  \\"Leave a pretty girl sad reputation, build a fight club, brad reputation\\"?  Come on, 'Ye.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think this is a horrible album.  I think it's okay.  However, I do think it's Kanye's worst album.  Most people would put that label on 808's, but at least he had emotion there...he had a purpose. This doesn't feel that way.<br /><br />Stand Out Tracks:<br />Bound 2 feat. Charlie Wilson<br />Guilt Trip feat. Kid Cudi<br />Blood On The Leaves<br /><br />Overall Score: 3/5eat. Kid Cudi<br />Blood On The Leaves<br /><br />Overall Score: 3/5

B00CU8OVIM|3.0|North Carolina's J. Cole has had a storied career with regards to the internet.  He started out making beats and posting them on forums.  His first few mixtapes (fantastic mixtapes, at that) gained him a pretty huge following online.  Then he released Cole World.<br /><br />Although it sold well, it didn't have the same spunk as his mixtapes.  Many said it wasn't as good as his mixtapes...I agree.  It didn't even come close.  That's why I was looking forward to Born Sinner...I was looking for that old Cole.<br /><br />With Born Sinner, Cole has done something that I honestly never thought I'd say.  Cole released an album that is, in short, boring.  For the most part, the lyrics, the beats...boring.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong...this is not a bad album.  Songs like Power Trip, She Knows, and Let Nas Down are some really good tracks.  I even liked Crooked Smile with TLC.  It's just that most of the music sounds uninspired.  Even worse, the Kendrick Lamar feature is basically wasted, which was really disappointing.<br /><br />This isn't a bad album (I think it's better than Cole World), but there's just not much that stands up.  It's definitely not better than his mixtapes...again.<br /><br />Stand Out Tracks:<br />Power Trip feat. Miguel<br />She Knows<br />Crooked Smile<br />Let Nas Down<br />Born Sinner<br /><br />Final Score: 3/5
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds, nuff said.  Game runs well on phone.  Easy to pass a lot of time playing.  Will be keeping!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Awesome DVD compilation. Always an avid Eagles fan, but still learned a lot about the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; stuff. Amazed that so much video was taken throughout the years even before they made it big. Glad to see that aging and maturity brought them back together. Wish there were no problems with Don Felder, but what the heck. Guys plugged in seamlessly. Great music no matter who played or sang. The bonus disc of the 1977 concert at the Capital Centre was superb. Worth the purchase, even if you only watch it once, but I doubt you can do that. Younger fans will enjoy this as yesterdays rockers are truly musicians in the purest form. Something to be influenced by. Don't wait, order one now.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I thought it was a very action packed and entertaining version of Hansel and Gretel. It kind of reminded me of a cross between Brothers Grimm and Van Helsing. The only flaw I had with it is that the F-Bombs seemed a little out of place for this era of movie, but don't let that detour you from seeing it it was full of great speciel fx and cool kick a$$ action.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it is great it is todaly guienes<br />if you get it I recommend the mine craft seeds pro app
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|All in all a pretty good album. Very well done and sounds Awesome. Alice In Chains never seem to let you down they always come out swinging with their own Amazing Sound. Has their Great Gritty, slightly gloomy style that you just can't get enough of. These guys just keep getting better and better as the years go by.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was very fun. It was not overly complicated but did require a bit of thought. It played well on my Kindle Fire.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series! Great characters and plots. Can get enough! Love the passion and steamy parts! Please keep the books coming!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game ! I sit here all day playing it!  I don't watch Tv. instead I play hill climb racing
B00B0A5XQU|5.0|I really enjoy Debbie Macomber, she makes me feel I am in the story and I can see and picture everyone. I feel like I am part of each person.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I couldn't wait to get it in the mail.  I listened to it immediately and the first song I recognized from their guest appearance on the season finale for CSI!  The entire album is awesome and I can't wait to see them live!!! #fanforlife
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Loved the book.  Not sure what happened to her brother.  Would have liked more about her life when she left, but guess that was not the story.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game. It was a lot of fun, but it was a bit short. Would love to see more like this. You actually have to think about what you are doing instead of mindlessly pressing buttons. Would definitely recommend.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|The R rating should have let me know what I was getting into, I watched it for a while hoping it would get better but it never did. Useless usage of fowl language over and over again. I wish I had never had purchased this movie, and the previews look so promising.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Works well.  Just wanted to give a good review, don't have much to say.  It's pretty basic. One two three
B008I34ZFW|4.0|Synopsis:  The year is 2018, and the United States of America has launched a manned mission to the moon in an effort to get the President of the United States (Stephanie Paul) re-elected; during which a black model by the name of James Washington (Christopher Kirby) is used as the front man for the mission under the guise that he's the first African-American person to walk on the moon.  As he and an astronaut arrive, they find that the Nazi's have existed on the dark side of the moon since 1945.  Though the other astronaut is immediately killed, Washington is taken captive by Klaus Adler (Gotz Otto), who is groomed to be the next Fuhrer, and presented to Mondführer (Or Moon Leader in English) Wolfgang Kortzfleisch (Udo Kier).  While scientist Doktor Richter (Tilo Prückner) discovers that Washington's mobile phone has the power for them to launch their spaceship, The President of the United States berates her assistant Vivian Wagner (Peta Sergeant) for the \\"failure\\" of the moon mission; all while Doktor Richter's daughter Renate (Julia Dietze) educates children on the glory of the Third Reich and the beauty that Earth will experience once the Nazi's return.  After flying to Earth to obtain more mobile phones and to meet the President of the United States, a newly-Caucasoid Washington (changed by Dr. Richter's experiments) introduces Adler and Renate to Wagner, who in turn uses Renate's enthusiasm about the Nazi agenda to further the President of the United State's political career.  Will the Americans work with the Moon Nazis on a shared agenda?  Will one of the two attempt to thwart the other?  How will the rest of the world react to the return of the Nazis?  And will Washington get to become himself again?<br /><br />If you aren't one to pay attention to current events, you're going to see this as a Sci-Fi B-Movie.  If you revel in current events, however, you're probably going to applaud at the way the movie satirizes both American and international political culture.  That in itself made it one of my favorite movies to watch, and the mix of Obama's \\"Yes We Can\\" message along with Palin's imagery drives home the point there's not a dime's difference between the two major political parties.<br /><br />I was invited for the sci-fi, but I stayed for the satire.  I recommend this to sci-fi buffs, political cynics, and the Mad Magazine crowd.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved every minute of it, can't wait to read the next one. I'm sure it will be just as good.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is awesome. Can't get enough. I really like the game speed. I ditched work just to play it. lol
B001AQQR2S|4.0|The book is always better, but this movie is a classic too. Funny and heart warming, despite the quality of some of the acting. Also, why is the narrator the voice of Mr. wormwood? Ew.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake were all great.  My first time with seeing Timberlake in a movie and enjoyed his performance.  Will have to try one of his CD's now.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I uninstalled this once and installed it back again for the purpose of apps updating but all my records were gone. Km trying to connect to facebook again and it doesnt. Please fix thank you
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have no regrets with this purchase, so many different compartments and its comfortable to walk around with. This is a good buy for sure.
B005K17RU0|2.0|The new upgrade was a step backward. The interface is ugly and too crowded. Please go back to your prior layout.
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|I enjoyed the book, but there were some parts which I did not understand, which, of course, was expected, as I an only 12 years old.
1594204217|5.0|This book is great.  It is informative and interesting.  I am a history and cooking nut and this social and cultural history of cooking by Michael Pollan is a great read.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Typical modern day Bruce Willis. He probably didn't even read the script. Worst movie that I have seen in some time. Avoid it.
B0079KGAOY|3.0|I was about to buy this - particularly after reading (in the editor's review) that the first one - a director's cut - had 7 extra minutes that enhance the main characters' backgrounds.  But I then read the customer reviews - and see that everyone who bought the blu ray collection says that there is no director's cut in this collection.<br /><br />So, Amazon - change the review! Otherwise no one will believe what you write about your product.  Fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice....  you finish it...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A lot of fun!  This is an enjoyable game that takes concentration.  It is good for kids 10 and up but adults would find it entertaining too.
B00B23O96A|1.0|not the Clapton I know. sounds like country but not well done, unrecognizable for us Clapton die hard fans. dissapointed
B007GCY8FS|3.0|IT was way  too slow paced. Reacher books are more fast and exciting. They're usually more twist plotted and mysterious.  Was not my favorite Reacher book.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|awesome movie to watch for any age young or old, it fun and would watch it over and over again
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie, and the music, you'll enjoy this CD. Glad I was able to find it here since none of my local stores had it, and as a Trekker I collect the soundtracks to all Trek movies.<br />The liner notes were an interesting read, and you can hear the evolution of the music from the '09 movie to this one.<br />Very enjoyable!
0316286869|5.0|I bought this book back when it first came out and loved it, then a few years ago (3 to be exact) I sold it cause I needed the extra cash as I was moving, ever since I have been looking for it, found here in Amazon, bought it and it is just like brand new again, I am thinking on going into make-up and I think is a good companion, specially if you want to do transformations. LOVE IT!!!!!!
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|Very glad I was shopping for new music and found this CD/DVD set. While I wish SOS was more popular and widely known, every time I hear their songs it sounds like they're being performed just for me.<br />And, there are no sound errors/glitches on this CD; it's live studio recordings, so you're hearing all those sounds before/after the tracks...it's like you're in the recording booth listening to a private concert.<br />Very worth the price!
B0064IOZY4|5.0|of all the Olafur Arnalds<br />this one... does it best...<br /><br />I have taken all of my Olafur Arnalds to the car...<br />and though I haven't tested it in rush hour...<br />thus far it provides a certain immunity to impatience.
B00908DDZM|4.0|I may be late to the fan club for the Mack and Ryan Lewis, but love the songs I heard before buying the CD, and those songs are the reason I bought the CD.<br />While I'm not a big rap fan, I like listening to each of the tracks so I can pick up the words and enjoy the music, and I've found several that I wish would be released as singles, since they're pretty good, IMO.<br />If you love Mackelmore, or want to support indy musicians, then you should pick this one up.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|My mom could never have made it through the<br />the hours in the theater but really wanted to see it<br />This is such a wonderful way to share the experience<br />too... and the pop corn is reasonably priced...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like the game but I'm stuck on level 4 already. cant get flashlight to work. will someone help me? other than that I like it. guess I will go back and c what I missed.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Too much movie to sit through in a theater for most seniors<br />yet such high quality that the home view is still grand.<br /><br />Sharing the experience... pausing for a potty break...<br />affordable snacks... time together... good memories..
B00CU8OVIM|1.0|I pre ordered this album as a gift for my younger sister 12 days ago. I also paid extra to have it gift wrapped. Not only did Amazon send the regular 16 track album version, they did not gift wrap it and charged me $14.99 for the CD, $20.99 for the gift wrapping and sales tax. The first representative I spoke with was very rude, didn't offer an apology and I ended up hanging up on her. The next representative informed me to \\"send back\\" the other cd and not only do I have to waste a trip to find a UPS to send it back, it's also an added inconvenience to have to print a label and now a surprise gift isn't a surprise anymore since it was shipped to my sister directly and now she doesn't have the<br />Deluxe edition and the point was to have it the day it was released. I will NEVER pre order anything on Amazon again. The worst experience ever.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|I have taken all of my Olafur Arnalds to the car...<br />and though I haven't tested it in rush hour...<br />thus far it provides a certain immunity to impatience.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|The story didn't move forward.  The editing was good!  Didn't really need to read the first two, since they re-introduced every character.  Other reviewers state that there will now be two more books to this trilogy.  I hope the story will get somewhere.  I wouldn't have minded if she just had too much going on in the story that she couldn't fit it in to one final book, but so disappointed that there was no story development in this book.  Spoiler alert:  Only new character is the person or mob that took the heat off Gideon.  I'm sure they will be blackmailing him in the future.  That is it.  Oh and Gideon and Eva love each other.  I won't be preordering the next book.  I don't expect anything to happen in the next book or even when they hope to publish it.  I\\"m assuming by book #5 she will decide that it will just be an on-going series.<br /><br />I don't think that we had to wait to get a better story the delay and wait went to get agents, publishers, editors, lawyers and such, who all want a piece of the money out of this and the next two or more books.  Who knows maybe she did have all in one final book.  So sad.  I may have to give up my erotica fetish and go back to reading real 500+ page $9.99 novels.  Spending $9.99 for these 2-4 hour reads is way too expensive.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|no matter how many of his works are on your shelf... add this one as a keepsake.<br />The musician ship is profound and the backstage track allows the musicians to<br />speak about their relationship to the music and to Leonard. Imagine being on the<br />road with Cohen for two years! what depth... and the tracks selected were the<br />one's that Leonard pronounced as having something special to them...out of all<br />of the performances of the same piece.<br /><br />Very.... zen.... Very...Leonard at home
0425263908|1.0|Where do I start? I have heard so many good reviews for this book but I just don't get it. Eva, the \\"heroine\\" is a whiny, self centered DRAMA QUEEN.  The whole story is basically Eva and Gideon having sex, Gideon saying/doing something she perceives as wrong, then she runs, Gideon comes after her, they have \\"amazing\\" sex, then she runs again.  Even the sex (endless) scenes got boring.  There was really NO plot, except Eva being a total drama queen.  Yes, this book was similar to Fifty Shades but at least in that book I could feel the authors love for the characters and what story she was trying to tell.
B003UESJH4|5.0|no sharp edges to the story...<br />a visual feast<br /><br />and worthy of replaying...<br />no worries over size or colors either...<br />just press play...

B0001I561E|1.0|This DVD froze every player it was put into!  We had to take each player to the repair man to have it removed.  SO frustrating.  Clearly, had to return.  I have been looking everywhere for this movie.  Too bad.  Shipping was fast, so far the seller has been nice. Haven't received a response to this complaint yet, however.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I really enjoy that this application makes my Kindle able to show an actual percentage of my battery life. I also am happy that it can help you keep your battery healthy!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|This girl has got it.  Original.  Great voice and sound.  Can't wait for her next single or album.  So much better than whats on the radio now-a-days.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|This is a great cable. Works exactly as it should, and Amazon doesn't try to gouge you like the other manufacturers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers becase you can get a lot of cool people.And you can get cool thing like a skatebord. And<br />that all the thing I love about subway suffers.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|A great price quick shipping just what I wanted .Only problem I had was the movie skipped a couple times but may have been player .Keep up good prices.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is enjoyable and isn't hard to play. Good for ages 8+. Epic is free, and that surprised me since the movie just came out.
B004LLDN3A|4.0|Great classic Movie for the whole family. Froze half way through and had to wait several min. for it to come back. That is the only reason it lost a star.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wow. What a book!! Less than five stars would not be fair. I had never heard of The Hunger Games before it took me awhile to start to understand what was  happening.  Buying this book  was an accident and one of the best mistakes I've ever made. Now I cannot wait to read Suzanne Collins other books, and the movie what a treat that will be. Sharon P
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is alot of fun to play. I would recommend it for hours of fun. Great for all ages

B00D3V97DO|5.0|It is so Great and Refreshing to hear Authentic Rock Music like it is meant to be.<br />And Black Sabbaths 13 Scores 100%  .  It is a  must have - for all who remember<br />listening to Music that brought out your energy when you listened to it and for<br />new generation listeners that will see what Real Rock is all about and can feel<br />the electricty that flows from the Music to your Soul.<br />- Long Live Rock and Roll-JONNYB
B000MAH5O2|5.0|Sadly a lot of the issues described within this text are still plaguing our society and nation today. We still face tough international upheaval, socio-economic hurdles, and a politically divided nation.<br />The book is worth reading and timeless.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of Nicolas sparks books because they all seem to be the same sad love story but this one was wonderful! I'd recommend it over and over!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game reminds me a lot of call of duty and has a great multiplayer and is fast paced but can glitch up a lot during multiplayer but i give it 10/10
B001ESCEQ0|5.0|Best Child's Play movie EVER! Best storyline, great movie to watch. I recommend to anybody. I would give this one a 5 star.
B0091REZMW|3.0|just to let you know some of the girls in this game are wearing dresses that are not finished yet. so be careful
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so so so so fun and supper awesome and epic game!!!!!!!!! Did I menchen it is super super fun to play the game
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Love this series and wish it had more episodes. The main characters are interesting and for the most part likable.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|Les Mis has had people wanting more since the beginning of its time. If you have ever seen the stage version the music so completely overwhelms you and sweeps you up that it's a miracle you can keep yourself from marching up on stage for the grand finale! And yet you also think, \\"Man, what if they incorporated amazing sets and acting and made this a real play... it would be EPIC!\\" And then you see the movie version and you just know that Liam Neeson is the perfect Val Jean, that if only every man, father, guardian were as he the world would spontaneously erupt into heaven; and that all the Javerts of the world would be compelled to commit suicide because Geoffrey Rush portrayed him so perfectly as the despicable villain that somehow still makes you feel sorry for him. And yet you are left thinking, \\"Man, what if they could sing too, and combine this incredible story with the soul hailing music... it would be EPIC!\\"<br />Everyone looking forward to the new Les Mis, myself included, just knew that it had the potential to be the most EPIC of all EPIC movie experiences in the history of EVER! Which is why, I think, we have tried so hard to love it. Against our better judgment we act like it HAS to be amazing, because if not the disappointment will consume us, because there is no way in our lifetimes they'll ever re-do this movie. We desperately NEED to love it!<br />But the problem is, it's just NOT epic. Not even close. It leaves you worse off than the play or the non-musical movie because now they've worked you up for nothing.<br />We get a sleazy, staccato Val Jean who seems afraid to hold any one note too long for fear we'll realize his vocal ineptitude and who can't for the life of himself remember if he's merely haunted by his evil past, or continues to be haunted by an evil nature. It's a sad day in Les Mis history when Val Jean hasn't been able to present his good will, up-standing moral character and changed life well enough that when he comes upon Cosette in the woods all you can think is, \\"Run AWAY, little girl, don't you dare tell that creep your name, you're better off with the Thenardiers!\\"<br />And then there's Javert.... Oh where do we start? Russell Crowe's singing \\"ability\\" (if you can call it that) makes you pity him so much you wish for his sake he'd just thrown himself off the dock at the beginning of the movie and gotten it over with it. There's no denying that Crowe is normally your fail-proof actor, and he does try his best, but even he sings as if simultaneously reading the future reviews that will come slamming on to his head after the movie comes out. There are moments where his gaze seems faintly apologetic - you can almost see his brain scroll reading, \\"Damn those iron-clad Hollywood contracts, I knew this was a bad idea!\\"  He's working so hard on getting.the.notes.right, that we don't even get the pleasure of seeing his facial expressions change, much less portray the relentless abiding-by-the-letter-of-the-law stigma of Javert.<br />Now Anne Hatthaway is practically hallowed ground, upon which we dare not tread. But tread we must... or plod, or trample... heck, let's just pull out the backhoe and tear out the whole plot. Anne, in this role, is reminiscent of the community theater diva who thinks she's so amazing that she has to stay in character 24/7, and misses the point that it's not all about her (the actress) every time she's on stage... that there's a bigger story to tell than her own overly-acted pitiful drama that lasts only long enough for you to ponder how she went from \\"innocent sister\\" to \\"lovely lady\\" with a haircut and a lost tooth. I cannot deny that she's got fairly functional pipes (compared to her co-stars...which is like saying Brad Pitt is an excellent actor because his co-star is Kristen Stewart), but seriously, I don't want to actually SEE them. And while I could lament about the mind-numbing choice of the Academy to honor her with an Oscar, I stopped being shocked by them back when Sandra Bullock won for Blind Side and Kiera Knightly was nominated for P&P. Clearly the highly acclaimed board is made up of E! retirees... or a million monkeys at a million Oscar ballot stations...<br />In case you think I'm unwittingly bashing right and left out of pure spite, let me hit the two high notes before it plunges back down again: The Thenardiers and the Revolution Chorus.<br />The Thenardiers = absolute perfection. Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen (it's probably the matching last names) are absolutely the only actors to mesh acting talent, musical chops and the completely necessary, \\"I don't care if you like me or not\\" attitude so lacking in the rest of the cast. Sascha's deliciously over-the-top, hilariously disgusting, pick-pocketing rendition of Mr. Thenardier is spot-on, and Helena is the Victor to his Hugo. Her money-fetish flirting is only rivaled by her split-second switch to evil faces at those who would get in her way. I have read that some think she was too tame, too bland... but that is the problem with this whole movie. Subtleties are what bring about the richness of character. If you have to have every fleeting emotion blown up in lights for you to get it, well... then... go back and watch I Dreamed A Dream to your heart's content.<br />The Revolution Chorus (aka all the people who SHOULD have had the leads) were so SO good. Painfully good. It was hard to understand how the director could have got it so right for those few, short scenes and so very wrong for nearly every other. Yes, I actually teared up during Red and Black... mostly mourning what the movie could have, should have been! *moment of silence please*<br />I suppose I cannot forget to mention the younger actors who had a much easier time actually acting while singing. This came as a welcome respite... but only in the sense that a starved person relishes stale bread crusts. When you've been suffering so long, you'll take what you can get.<br />Eddie Redmayne is probably the best of the bunch, and if you can get past him singing like he's got a small colony of frogs living in his throat you just might be able to appreciate his capability. Amanda Seyfried is hard to diss for her portrayal of Cossette. There was so little developing of her character that the actress had no time to let her talent shine and so all I could do was hope to goodness her out-of-control vibrato didn't send her spinning across the room. Samantha Barks is inexplicably the lone stage transplant, the Broadway aura seeping from her pores in every bland camera close-up. Yes, sure, she stands the test of the unforgiving choice to do live singing, but earns a bright red F when it comes to the unforgiving lack of distance she is usually afforded with her audience. She gives us no insight into why she loves Marius, why she would be willing to protect his love for Cossette, how on earth she turned out so normal being raised by the Thernardiers, why she had to dress like a man to fight, why she kept the love letter when she'd already taken Marius to the girl and why-oh-why her mascara didn't run when she sings in the rain! Her dimples are adorable, though.<br />Of course, we must give credit where credit is due: The King's Speech. To be clear, the only reason Tom Hooper was allowed so MANY missteps in the painful, torturous destruction of a classic is the sainthood he earned in his flawless making of the rightfully acclaimed King's Speech film. But come ON, people. Just as we should have given Peter Jackson a hearty pat on the back after LOTR and then a hearty pat on the backpack as we sent him packing after the horror show King Kong, so must our treatment be of Mr. Hooper.<br />I absolutely commend and SUPPORT the idea of live singing! As the cast explains, it is hard to decide how you will react in a studio months before you actually shoot the scene, which can lead to some of the robotic or slightly \\"off\\" moments we've seen in other blockbuster musicals (The MusicMan, and even moments of Phantom of the Opera). But IF you will make this bold choice, you absolutely MUST compensate with TRAINED and GLORIOUS voices! Besides the fact that this heavenly score deserves only the most angelic voices our planet can produce, if you are going to slow down the action and, in essence, put the movie on pause for every musical number (98.2% of the movie), in order for your cast to be able to perform, you had better make those notes goose bump-worthy good. Instead, it feels like any momentum gained by the non-vocal parts of the score come to a screeching halt when a cast member puts to use his or her unassisted vocal chords and begins wandering around an obvious rolling camera, allowing us to scrutinize every painful note they eject.<br />But truly, the greatest travesty of all is the disservice to the story, though I admit I have not read the book. It is a beautiful story of a man redeemed, a woman restored, a girl rescued, a villain drowned, true love... and the French Revolution. Oh, yes, that IS the major point around which the whole end of the narrative turns did you not notice? Considering that the startup of the rebellion at Le Marquis's funeral looks more like a flash mob than a revolution, that the only real fighting we actually see is when a cute little boy gets shot for apparently no good reason, that the empty tables and chairs are only tragic when you understand the cost, and that the final battle is to be waged between dead people and... no one... you probably didn't.<br />Of course, you can't deny that the music in itself is inspiring, and they really did pull out the stops for the big numbers, and you almost... almost... get as excited as Anne Hatthaway at the final number... okay, scratch that, NO ONE gets as excited as Anne Hatthaway, but truly, the end does make you want to clap, to cheer, if only because you've finally finished this train-wreck on reels. And to top it all off, they even get you writhing at the credits... when you just realize you've watched Colm Wilkinson throughout the whole movie and were gypped of his phenomenal voice soaring through the flawless score!<br />So, Epic? Well, to use another over-used idiom of the times... it's certainly an epic FAIL!ably the best of the bunch, and if you can get past him singing like he's got a small colony of frogs living in his throat you just might be able to appreciate his capability.

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I have listened to Jimi for over 20 years and this Album is just a great follow up decades of the great music he produced.  I just hope there is more in the vault that we haven't seen.
0785153942|4.0|First off I would like to say that the overall rating of this product would've been FIVE stars. Sadly I had to take off one star for its including unnecessary partial nudity scenes. Without these, the book would have been a great comic to share with kids and teenagers. I know that comic books artist strive to include these things to attract more customers, but IN MY OPINION, they could have still told this amazing story without including these things.<br /><br />For those who do not know what this book is about, it is a graphic novel that is meant to be a prequel to the upcoming 2013 film Pacific Rim by Warner Bros. Pictures. It helps explain how the Pacific Rim universe came to be, with the earth invasion of giant inter-dimensional monsters (called Kaiju) and mankind's attempt to stop them by fighting them with giant human-piloted robots/mechs (called Jaegars).<br /><br />Now onto the review:<br /><br />Okay, in regards to the STORY of this book, it starts off in the middle of the Kaiju War with a reporter interviewing several characters who have been affected directly by the events that have unfolded over the years of battling the monsters. They tell their stories and the reader is taken through flashbacks back in time to different dates of importance during the beginning of the Kaiju war. The depth of each character and their story really helps set the foundation for some of the characters that will appear in the movie. It also explores the conception of the idea of the Jaegers, the challenges that involved creating them and piloting them.<br /><br />You will learn more about the characters from the movie and see what motivates them to keep fighting the monsters. These stories include:<br /><br />Stacker Pentecost's story (portayed by actor Idris Elba)<br /><br />Raleigh Becket's story (portayed by actor Charlie Hunnam)<br /><br />Mako Mori's story (portayed by actor Rinko Kikuchi)<br />and others...<br /><br />In regards to the QUALITY of this book, it is a really good quality hard cover with an amazing picture in the front. The illustrations of the book are attention-grabbing and highly detailed. You can tell a lot of thought went into designing the Kaiju monsters and the Jaegars (not only for this comic but also for the movie), and they are wonderfully illustrated here in comic book drawn form (as opposed to the CGI, real-world appearance they will have in the movies).<br /><br />A great part of the product the inclusion of an AMAZING two page Introduction by writer Travis Beachman in which he details his ideas about creating the universe of Pacific Rim and the story that they try to tell from it. It is as he says \\"The [Pacific Rim] world doesn't fit in its story; the story fits in the world\\"! Also includes a few pages that illustrates the process of creating this graphic novel: from script to layouts, from shaded drawings to fully colored and worded panels! A great addition to the novel!<br /><br />In conclusion, an AMAZING experience for anyone, but especially if you are planning to see the movie Pacific Rim when it hits theaters July 12, 2013.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|It kept me reading, but by the end I wasn't sure why.  Will watch the film for sheer cinematic beauty.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Highly recommended to readers of Kite Runner and One Thousand Splendid Suns. A much anticipated novel and worth the wait.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Dr. Moriarty clearly has a passion and deep knowledge about Michael's life, his career, family situation, challenges, successes, and tragedies.  Her research is very thorough and her writing clear and stylish.  She gives great details about all her subjects and it's clear she has genuine love for this singer and excellent personal experience with his circle of contacts.  I recommend this book highly.
0670033693|1.0|Oh my gosh, I cannot even believe the high ratings this book is getting. It is so slow and tiresome, I did not even care who the murderer was anymore. There was nothing interesting going on here at all! Please, C J Box is so much better than this writer.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After waiting how many months???? to finally see how Gideon & Eva's story ends we get nothing but more waiting and more questions.... I am very disappointed Ms. Day decided to drag this series through 2 more books. This series was one of my favorites but now I don't even think I will waste the money for 2 more books.  I agree with one reader who said $30 is alot to invest in one story... This book was not even close to being as good as the first 2 and I'm beginning to not like Eva because of the way she acts....<br /><br />I think Ms. Day should rethink draging this series through 2 more books and try to save this awesome story by giving us 1 more book that wraps everything up and gives us a happy ending.. and drop the cost of the book so readers will give her a chance to redeem herself...<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Day's writing but I think money is becoming more important than her readers and that is ashame...
B0053O8ARI|5.0|The first 8 episodes are my favorites! I believe they embody the concept of the show better than any of the subsequent episodes. The chemistry between Max & Oleg & Max & Earl is hilarious and I believe the writers need to refocus there.<br /><br />The show is called 2 BROKE Girls so it was very believable that Max had 2 jobs especially since having a small cupcake business wouldn't have made her enough money to quit her 2nd job babysitting in Manhattan and that job could have even helped fund the cupcake business' materials. Peach was a great character to show the contrast between Caroline's outlook on being rich and Peach's outlook on being rich; she was also great to show the contrast between Max's common sense & down-to-earth personality & Peach's complete lack of common sense.<br /><br />Even my husband loves the show! It may have \\"girls\\" in the title & have 2 girls as the main characters, but the type of humor & other characters create a hilarious show that both guys and girls will enjoy. Oleg & Earl are fantastic, inappropriate, & original. Everyone will enjoy their moments in the show.
B0051HNMTI|1.0|Why does this now take up a large amount of space? Update Sux...now I need to remove this and all other by same dev.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I thought the writing and voice was great, but I can't help but feel like the romance between the two main characters was a little over dramatic and unbelievable. (No to mention a bit scary at times.) I would classify this as an adult book, but then again maybe I'm a prude. Who knows?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard, not too easy.  The scenes are easy to switch back and forth and the puzzles are tantalizing enough to hold my interest.  When I think, I'll stop after this one, another pops up and &quot;here we go again!&quot;
B008Y6TGIY|5.0|Great entertaining movie for kids and family alike.it kept my 3 year old so engross the whole time .so exciting
B008R14YBK|5.0|She's an incredible singer and actress, my girls love this album. I hope her next one is as great as his one.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I think this is my favorite. The boys have hit their stride with these very catchy yet meaningful songs.  very worth you money.
B008J34466|5.0|Only Pink can make you love her music no matter what it's about. She speak her mind and let the girls know not to take crap from anyone.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|super funny movie, full of awesome puns. great for the family but maybe not the little ones, mild swearing during one segment and lots of sexual innuendos.<br />also recommend: Robin Hood: Men in Tights
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Unable to put it down once started.  So sad but oh so true in our world. I highly recommend this.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This product has helped me tack on my kindle so that it doesn't die suddenly on me which is awesome because I play a lot of things on here
0142410322|5.0|Book Cover: I thought this book cover was fun, colorful, & eye catching. I love how it incorporates illustrations from the story on the cover and gives you just enough to wonder what all happens in the book. *STAR*<br /><br />Story: I loved this continuation of the Charlie & The Chocolate Factory Story. The story will keep you on your toes and is a great children's read and also a great read to help you open up your imagination and get you out of a reading rut. *STAR*<br /><br />Author: I had never read anything by this author before but had seen almost all of his books that had been turned into movies. I love this author and look forward to reading more of his works. I think he was very talented in writing and creating a story that not only is a good read but good to open your imagination up for you to explore. The writing is very good in the aspect that Roald Dahl describes in such great detail that you can really see what he is explaining or talking about. *STAR*<br /><br />Characters:I love the characters in this book. I find the President to be comical and Mr. Wonka to be amusing and entertaining. *STAR*<br /><br />Cleanliness: There was nothing bad in this book that I read. *STAR*<br /><br />  Overall Review: This is one of my favorite children's books and even fun to read as an adult. As I said above it grabs your imagination and makes your run with it. This is a quick read that can help you get out of a reading slump and really reignite your love for reading. The illustrations in this book are great and really give face to your imagination. I think this is a must read for everybody especially if your love the original Charlie & The Chocolate Factor.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|This is a nice action figure.  Sculpt is good and the colors rich and textured.  I recommend it for the casual collector.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this story. I Hate how it ended but that's because I was not expecting it to end that way. I cant want for the next book
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Tough to get through some of the boring characters. Good book to fill in some of the stories for the other characters.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Used it soon as it arrived.  We have two kindles and mine is black, hers red.  No confusion when we get up & use them at breakfast.
B003PHJLR8|5.0|A spectacular movie, and it becomes better as time goes by. A classic.<br /><br />I don't know right now, but it was the last one available.<br /><br />And the only problem is that has only three languages in subtitles, but it still deserves five stars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and challenging! I was very impressed with the creative ideas and various clues you had to find. Will definitely have to play more games like this
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Great game I love it I love how u get to make the girl from ugly to beautiful and the game is awesome
B00DF0POXA|3.0|I am first to say I am a music lover and I respect everybody's opinion but how could people really give this 5 stars? J. Cole's album is 5 stars no doubt but this Kanye album is not even close to 4 stars people be honest with yourself and your ears whether u are a fan of Kanye or not this is not G.O.O.D music but it may be different but that don't make it sound good that's just my opinion!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game and a challenge that everyone can play it is great and the best part is it is free.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|People if your give Kanye's new album Yeezus 5 stars this J.Cole album is 10 times better than Kanye's album and because Kanye and Lil Wayne try different things don't make everything they touch good!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It is a good app for waking u up just don't get the 99 cent version get the free one.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|What can I say.  My son and I rented it and loved it.  We love the Bat Man, and will probably watch it again.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I read this book in under 5 hours I couldn't wait to see how it ended! And now I'm left with a cliff-hanger, I can't wait for your next book. I expect it will be mind blowing.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Just good clean intelligent intrigue and interesting characters and story line. This series is delightful.  Archer is<br />by far my favorite writer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game subway surfers is a wonderful game because it helps you focuses on the game. It is also wonderful because it is entertaining!!!!!!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This App is reliable.  I use multiple alarms all day long to remind me to do various tasks.  I would recommend this app when traveling, or for taking medication throughout the day or to remind you to go get the kids.  With the check mark system, one can turn on various set alarms as needed.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is very cool. I like it but I'm not sure why they make the screen dark with just one little spot light.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|I love Kill Bill movies. And those are gory!!! This movie for me topes Kill Bill (as far as gory) I love ninjas and action. This has all of that and more. But if you are not up for too much blood don't watch it.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Tarantino always comes up with the most unusual characters and bizarre amazing story lines and plot twists. Never fails to entertain.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Sent this to my daughter in Germany.  She loves it.  If there was anything to report bad about it, she would know, as they are collectors of hundreds of videos.  But again, she loves it.  It got there early too!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Can not go wrong with the purchase of this third season or any of the other seasons. It's a load of laughs and is in my opinion the best company series to come alone in a long time. It's a must for your collection. You can not go wrong with this purchase.
0743277708|5.0|A great story I read when I was younger I finally have a copy of. The seller gave me a book that was in great condition, no marks in the book or rips
B001DJLD1M|5.0|3 great movies plus for some really great action sequences and slow motion action effects this is a must for any collection. These movies were ahead of their time.
1781162646|5.0|When Stephen King's pen is finally laid to rest, perhaps the one enduring feature of his work will be his ability to connect with his readers on almost a personal level. In \\"Joyland\\", though not nearly the best King tale ever spun, the Master is again able to relate the subject matter (in this case carnivals) so close to your soul that you can't help but get invested.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, \\"Joyland\\" tells the story of a college student who gets a summer job in the carnival business. While working at Joyland one summer, the young man must not only deal with age-related issues such as \\"the loss of the first steady girl\\" and \\"what am I going to do with my life\\", but also fitting into the carny atmosphere and dealing with the ghost that supposedly haunts the premises of the park's spookiest ride.<br /><br />What makes \\"Joyland\\" such an interesting story is that most readers will be able to relate to the carnival atmosphere. As children, usually on at least one occasion, we have all been fascinated by attending a carnival or fair (big or small). I know I could relate. Thus, the rides, terminology, imagery, and themes in the book immediately strike a nostalgic chord.<br /><br />It also helps that this is a good story. Not King's very best, I would have to say, but intriguing enough and visceral enough to produce the kind of emotions that really will make you feel as if you care about the principles.<br /><br />Please, whatever you do, do not be scared away from this novel because of its marketing as \\"Hard Case Crime\\" noir. To me, this was just a typical King yarn and in no way, shape, or form any kind of \\"genre\\" tale.<br /><br />If you are a fan of King or just like human-relatable stories in general, \\"Joyland\\" will be a fun read for you. It isn't too \\"deep\\", but also isn't too \\"scarce\\" either. A nice summer read out by the lake.
B000W91RUG|5.0|see my remarks for season 3 also purchased. It's a load of laughs and again a great season for your collection.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|this was just really well done. GAME interface is smooth.  It does what it promises. No bugs. Great graphics and sound.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|See my remarks on season 3 also purchased, You cannot go wrong with this series a lot of laughs grat for your collection.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was a marvelous! I read the book because it was assigned to my son for summer reading.  Thought I would read it first to see what it was about.  Lucky me!  What a pleasure. I think this should be a required reading for every person in the human race.  What a beautiful lesson. Enjoy!
B0091REZMW|1.0|Love the concept, but wouldn't know about the execution of it, as it keeps freezing. any time i try to \\"click\\" on anything, nothing happens. i close it out, and come back and can play, find items, finish, then nothing again. In don't get it. i gave it several chances, kept having to close out and come back to be able to do anything. none of the buttons would work after finding the items. uninstalling. contact me when it works. not to mention it took 20+ minutes just install.

B00BEWCIJY|5.0|Husband loves slayer. I wasn't sure which albums he had so I gambled and bought the most recent I could find (I swear description said 2013 but when it came it was made in 2009)<br />Anyways good, heavy album that that is true to the slayer sound. Very happy I purchased it.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I loved him on American Idol, voted for him. This guy could sing the fleas off a dog, what a range. I can listen to him over and over again. God given gift.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is great!Once I get on, I don't want to get off. However, there is 1flaw: you need wireless to power the whole game. But, other than that it's a great game.
B0061S073A|5.0|Just plain and simple a great parental control app.  Very easy to use and very secure.  I have this installed on two Kindle Fires and one Samsung Galaxy Tab.  Highly recommended.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|we love this show and will continue to watch. we love watching it on amazon and love to watch whenever we want. We do not have DVR so this works great!
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|J Cole's \\"Born Sinner\\" is a more dark-toned predecessor to his first album \\"Cole World: The Sideline Story.\\"  This is a stellar album from the Roc Nation signee that shows a growth in his ability not only to tell a story within his music, but to be an excellent producer as well. Cole's first effort on \\"The Sideline Story\\" was a noble one, but it had pieces missing that would've made it a classic; \\"Born Sinner\\" has all of those missing pieces.<br /><br />\\"Born Sinner\\" begins with the dense opening track \\"Villuminati,\\" with a B.I.G. \\"Juicy\\" sample. Cole quickly puts it out there that this album is \\"way darker this time.\\" Along with his stellar growth in production that is displayed here, he shows he has a self-confident side in the line \\"Sometimes I brag like Hov.\\" Cole goes on an odd tirade about `homophobes' and also addresses Illuminati rumors making the comparison between old white billionaires and young black millionaires. The interlude \\"Kerney Sermon\\" is a very interesting religious infomercial; crazy how a thing like that is real.<br /><br />\\"Land of the Snakes\\" samples OutKast's \\"Da Art of Storytelling\\" as Cole has a vibrant, cocky attitude about the women he sleeps with. A unique connection between sinner and saint is made in the line \\"She said, \\"You bout to miss church\\" while she riding me, I like my sundaes with a cherry on top.\\" He soon loses the careless vibe as a woman he previously slept with and left finds him and tells him the pain he caused her. A nice story as told here as you see how Cole is slowly acknowledging the wrong in the things he does. The lead single \\"Power Trip\\" was a huge step up from his last album's single, \\"Work Out.\\" While this song has had commercial success, it is much more than just a radio single. It is well-constructed and has a clever sense of telling the story about his past love. Miguel adds a nice touch to this one on the hook. \\"Mo Money\\" is a short, direct interlude that is all about money. It is clever in a sense that every line ends with money and he connects it with all types of cash that all types of people make.<br /><br />\\"Trouble\\" continues the no feelings for women theme, as Cole starts to discover the repercussions of sleeping with a girl and leaving her. The message here isn't nearly as strong or as good as \\"Land of the Snakes,\\" this one just feels too generic for me; it is a decent song at best. \\"Runaway\\" is a major improvement from the last cut, as it was another song that showed some nice production value. Cole's conflict here is living a life of commitment or living a life with no commitment. Cole's vocals on the hook are actually pretty nice with a pattern of \\"runaway, runaway, runaway, I'm holding on desperately.\\" Comedian Mike Epps is a funny surprise addition to this also.<br /><br />\\"She Knows\\" is one of the weaker cuts on this album just as \\"Trouble\\" was, though it had some nice nerdy rap references. \\"Rich Ni--az\\" is arguably the darkest song on the album, with an appealing background mix of a harp and raindrops. Cole makes the transition from hating the rich to becoming one of them, but claiming he does not want to have their tendencies. The \\"you got what I want, I got what you need/ how much for your soul and uh\\" hook is very powerful and is purposeful in sending a message of how people will do anything to get rich.<br /><br />Following the \\"Where's Jermaine?\\" skit, J Cole teams up with rising emcee Kendrick Lamar on the track \\"Forbidden Fruit.\\" While it is a shame Kendrick doesn't rap on this, he is a welcomed addition on the hook. The first verse covers the biblical story of Adam and Eve and the temptation of the forbidden garden and its infamous forbidden fruit, the apple. \\"Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip\\" shows how Eve provoked Adam into a sinful act. Cole eventually puts this in more modern terms with the same subject of temptation, along with adding a few other subjects. This is one of the more recently recorded songs on the album, as it includes Cole mentioning Kanye's album Yeezus.<br /><br />\\"Chaining day\\" stands out on its own as it tackles the subject of rappers and their materialistic habits. This reminded me a bit of Kanye's classic \\"Jesus Walks,\\" but it a totally different way. The concept is fresh and pleasant to hear, as he reflects on when he was obsessed like the other rappers. \\"Ain't That Some S--t\\" is the albums other interlude and its primary purpose is to show Cole's advanced production skills. Cole grabbed the duo `TLC' for a nice nostalgic throwback on the cut \\"Crooked Smile.\\" The basic message is embrace who you are because nobody is perfect. The vocals from T-Boz and Chilli are nothing short of great and this is one of the more soothing and melodic beats on the album.<br /><br />\\"Let Nas Down\\" was one of the more anticipated tracks on \\"Born Sinner\\" and it lived up to the hype. This is story-telling at its finest as Cole goes through the story of how his idol Nas was disappointed in Cole's radio single \\"Work Out\\" from his first album. Cole goes through the detailed story on the track and how it ended up fueling him to make better music and redeem himself for Nas. \\"Born Sinner\\" finishes off the album with a feature from the underrated James Fauntleroy. This is a smooth track that caps this off in a perfect way; we get that personal side of Cole once more and a spot with the Choir from the \\"Villuminati\\" intro. The deluxe edition also has some nice tracks including \\"Miss America,\\" \\"New York Times\\" featuring 50 Cent and Bas, and \\"Sparks Will Fly\\" featuring Jhene Aiko.<br /><br />Cole claimed he rapped himself out of a dark place here and it shows. The album makes a slow transition from a dark beginning to an uplifting ending and it works on all phases. A few tracks on this album tend to drag a bit and the fact that Kendrick Lamar didn't rap was a letdown, but those are the only complaints. In comparison to \\"The Sideline Story\\", this album makes leaps and bounds in musicality style and production. \\"Born Sinner\\" is J Cole's best work to date.<br /><br />Recommended Tracks:<br />1.) Villuminati<br />4.) Power Trip (feat. Miguel)<br />15.) Let Nas Downt includes Cole mentioning Kanye's album Yeezus.<br /><br />\\"Chaining day\\" stands out on its own as it tackles the subject of rappers and their materialistic habits.

B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Once again a very good read, characters flowed well through from 2. I'm sure Sebastian will still be the central character in 4.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an exceptional book. This is a book meant to be shared and treasured. It creates a hauntingly beautiful journey.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love listening to their album to relax when stressed at work. It contains so many good songs. i would recommend it.
098555780X|5.0|when i first saw the word &#34;fusion&#34; i was skeptical but then i opened it and started reading this book. it is excellent.  i do some<br />work with macrame and i can't wait to combine his ideas with macrame. the only drawback is that they are not really that<br />easy to master.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Amazing band with amazing music. I would recommend this album to anyone who is an alternative music fan. Every song is unique and enjoyable.
0920668372|5.0|I am currently 35 weeks pregnant with my first baby and I read this book to him on a daily basis. I truly recommend this book to all parents or expecting parents. I do not understand how so many people can rate this book 1 star. It is great and very heartwarming. There has not been one time where I have completely read this book and did not cry. This is my all time favorite children's book. I cannot wait until my son is born so I can continue to read this book to him and actually see his reaction. :) This is definitely a must have!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. Game play is unique and the graphics are awesome! It is definitely worth a try.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I was scared. i was jumping. i was hiding behind my girlfriends hand. And the ending made me say \\"WHAT THE HE**\\". If u love a good twisting surprising ending like how the Sixth Sense made u say \\"what did i miss?\\". Then watch this. The ending will shock you.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Great plot, stories to make you laugh, not any mystery but a good law story nonetheless. A good page turner!
B008JFUNYG|1.0|THIS MOVIE IS IN MY TOP 10 DUMBEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME! I CANT BELIEVE I WASTED MONEY TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Must See!!! It's many movies rolled into one and so worth the effort. Leaves you feeling uplifted with its strong moral backbone.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|I love watching this cartoon with my kids. and they love replaying it over and over again. It never gets old.
B002L9N4EM|3.0|Not that great... is cool and all.. but not that cool.. kinda disappointing.. It is REALLY simple, and doesnt have anything different.. but is a nice gift for fans of the show.
B004LWZW24|3.0|The movie had me for awhile. I mean i was actually jumping nd screamed a few times but the ending was just a big let down. The ending killed the scare out of me and ruined the excitment.
1449433251|5.0|perfect! it got here really quick and it looks awesome! it is REALLY heavy, but also really cool! I recommend.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Now this is a movie i can watch over and over again. i have seen all the ironman movies plus the all avengers and this movie was awesome. cant wait for the dvd.
B008N1LL42|4.0|[[ASIN:B008N1LL42 Battleship]]<br />Creative with a touch of Nostalgia. I especially liked the way they employed the short comings of computer operated weapons systems verses old style manual methods. The failure of computers in a wartime scenario is a real and probable scenario. The old timers going back into action 70 years later gave me real goose bumps and a true feeling of American National Pride. The aliens and their technology were believable. Their vulnerability reminded me that this is not the first time American ingenuity has triumphed over seemingly invincible enemy forces. My father is one of the few WWII Veterans still alive who played a part in it all. Unfortunately, the only unwinnable battle our proud warriors have ever had to face is the Veterans Administration! Buy this movie and you will be entertained for sure.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed reading CATCHING FIRE and  so glad my grandson helped me download  Suzanne Collins 3 book on my tab.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I had debated about the 3D version after seeing Thor in 3D in a theatre. It had made the action difficult to watch.  I am glad to have the 3D version of Avengers. It is nicely done and doesn't have any real eye-poking or gimmicky type images. The only issue I had was some difficulty focusing on some subtitles.<br /><br />Hands down, the best super hero movie made yet.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that you should buy this game because it is really really great it has not froze,it has not harmed anything so it is really great.........
B000QCS8TW|4.0|There's a lot of sub par fiction being published right now. This series is the real deal. Strong character development, plot twists, and a world for heroes and Kincaid brought to life! Get lost in it! You won't be sorry!
B0002KZAKS|2.0|I am not sure if I was unlucky and got the bad ones, but I found the build quality was poor. The wire connection feels loose. One of them stopped working after a few times of use. Now I am going to buy some other brands.
0843178108|5.0|Small books - big memories.  Glad that you have these available.  2nd generation birthday gift;  grandson has enjoyed the ones I bought for his mother.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I completely enjoyed this game. Lots of fun puzzles that are not too complicated. This is a great game to play when you have a few minutes to yourself. I recommend this game to any that like brain games. I look toward to playing more levels as soon as they are offered.
B000003NA4|5.0|Listening to Diana Krall is like being in love. The music is great, her talent as a piano player is phenomenal, and her in-the-pocket singing style is exactly in the money. Love it!
B004K00NMG|5.0|The video quality was great. I enjoy the storyline. I watches it with my 3 year old and she handled it pretty well.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was a die hard &#34;give me the book&#34; person until I went on an extend trip and wanted to take several books.  Not wanting to lug them around, I decided to use this program for the trip.  That was 2 years ago, and as of this writing, I still have about 10 &#34;real&#34; books waiting for me to read from before the download.  By far, this is the best way to read.
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|I love Superman and the old soundtracks. Most of the Amazon reviews are good but it's not for me. It might be great when played along side the onscreen action but otherwise I'm not enough of an orchestra fan to really enjoy it. I'll listen to it all the way through but it appears the main Superman theme that has always been inseparable is gone completely, not just re-arranged.
B00005JM02|5.0|Let's be honest, how could someone not love this movie?!  Almost impossible to find in regular DVD (ie - not blue ray bc not everyone has joined the 21st century) but I am so glad we found it.  :)
B0064MGU98|5.0|Can't get enough!  I am on season two and loving it - so gladi have two more seasons to watch!!!
B00AEFXE3Q|5.0|The product came a lot sooner than was expected, no hassles! It was definitely worth the price I paid for it!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I have watched almost all the modern superhero movies out there, always looking for the right one. I've been an avid superman fan since I was young. All of the past superman movies were lacking, either they didn't have enough fighting or they were too cheesy. Man Of Steel changed everything for me. This film has so much powerful emotion contained throughout. There are hidden meanings and foreshadowings that I picked up on which make it so much more exciting to watch. I recommend this great movie for anyone that loves superman and is willing to see a new approach. A more modern realistic approach. Man of Steel deserves a 5/5 rating easily. A visual masterpiece of our time.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|I work with technology for a living between building computers, programming, working with cameras among other areas.  Went out to build a computer for a friend and used this processor.  Must say, great processor with a great price point.  Performs better than I had anticipated for the build even handles video gaming.<br /><br />Working with computers, this is a nice note for gamers on a budget.  A processor with higher processing power (i.e. 3.4-3.6 ghz) per core rather than a higher number of cores is excellent for gaming.  So I would highly recommend this for as I said, the gamer with a budget.<br /><br />On the concept of basic use, very fast booting, opens programs immediately and manages all essential tasks wonderfully.  Great overall performance from this processor.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Everything you need to stay connected with business network, friends in the business, and personal interest groups.  Love the educational segments in all aspects of business!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This was an awesome BluRay movie, the video and audio quality were crisp and vibrant and clear. I would definitely recommend it.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've already read this book twice cover to cover. Altucher writes honestly with nothing held back, he will tell you all about his failures and how he  constantly had to reinvent himself to get back on his feet.<br /><br />This book can be for aspiring entrepreneurs, those feeling stuck, those looking to network better and more.<br /><br />He stresses the importance of focusing on your overall health to be successful. Definitely recommend James` book
B004RUF9DC|4.0|I thought BluRay was better than DVD, this was a dissappointment. The video and audio was no better than VHS quality, it was a real let down.
B00BN3ECTS|4.0|Good movie! Not as great as the book but still and enjoyable movie to sit down and watch. I recommend it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was an awesome BluRay Movie, Brilliant colors, super sharp, clear picture. I love the digital copy, I can watch it anywhere.
0425263908|5.0|Great start to a wonderful series, Gideon and Eva are two characters to fall in love with.  Your hooked early.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Entwined In You by Sylvia Day<br /><br />Gideon and Eva continued...<br /><br />Hmmmm... where to begin... I liked, sort of loved parts, and hated others... Well, of course this book, this series deals with a mountain of \\"dark\\" subjects... however, the dark subject matter in this particular installment is not what you think it is.  I have to say, I'm a tad bit dissatisfied with this one.  The first two I flew right through in one day.  This one took me roughly a week.  I had to keep setting it down for fear of throwing Kindle up against the wall due to the repetitive writing.  It was like reading a diverse version of the first two.  Not that is wasn't good writing mind you.  Sylvia Day is an outstanding writer, I just feel that she could have wrapped this series up with this book, but to know avail, it will carry on with a fourth book now!  Bleh!<br /><br />Gideon and Eva have changed, evolved a little in this book.  Things are unquestionably different between them.  Gideon seems to have lost some of his domineering edge.  He's still very much in the game, but more so on the outside of it then IN it!  I badly miss the old Gideon... the one who wouldn't take no for an answer, the one who gave me shivers when he entered a room, and most definitely the one who made my panties moist when I read his dialogue!  Same with Eva, she's changed considerably and for me, it's for the better.  No more whining and being unsure of herself.  I like the increase in her confidence level.  I did a couple air fist pumps over her sass!  Now let's tend to those other side characters.... Let's start with Eva's parents... Her Mother can go fly a kite, sheesh tracking devises on her own daughter, get real lady and get help for you own guilt!  The step dad, well, he's basically the $$ behind all the glitz and that's all I ever want to read about him.  Now Eva's Dad, well, I just adore that man!  When he came running out to Eva over what he learned about her past, well, it just reminded me of my own Dad who came running to me when I needed him the most too!<br /><br />This one was NOT, I repeat NOT effortless to read.  It had a ton of filler crap to me that could have been replaced with more meaty parts to make this book the end of the series.  I mean come on, E.L. James did it in three books!  I often found myself skipping around and search for said \\"meaty\\" parts so I could end the damn saga.  I enjoyed about 50% of the book, the other 50% I merely endured!  Not sure I'll pick up the next (4th) book or not.  It's $9.99 for cripes sakes, that's a lot of cash to be skipping around and we'll almost certainly have to wait another year for it.  Poop!  It's 369 (Kindle Version) pages long and at my remembrance, the story itself could have been summed up in 100+ less pages!  No wonder Amazon's average rating for it is 3.2 stars!<br /><br />Too many lows and not an adequate amount of highs and the climax... well, I have to say WHAT CLIMAX.  It was non-existent.  There was nothing, nada, zilch to make me want to procure the next one!  It was neither happy or sad, thrilling or boring, or even just a touch of suspense.  NOTHING!  Maybe she rushed the release of this one, maybe she ran out of things to say about them, who knows.  What I DO know is I anticipated more from this book and was greatly disappointed.<br /><br />3.5 starsmy own Dad who came running to me when I needed him the most too!<br /><br />This one was NOT, I repeat NOT effortless to read.

B0090O07RS|5.0|They were doing one of those PBS telethons and I just happened to see this gorgeous film<br />of the Doors filmed @ the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1968. I didn't even know this thing<br />existed. Just the first song, 'When the music's over' it's worth buying this DVD. They build their<br />sound just from the high pitched organ and bass, drums, and then WHAMO Mr. Jim Morrison<br />comes in with cutting guitar and it becomes magic. This should be studied buy anyone wanting<br />to see real star power in show and the music business. I think I'm going to go watch it again.<br />And, get the Blu-ray! This one demands it!
B00908DDZM|5.0|This CD has a lot of different sounds surrounding the world of rap/hip hop.  There is a lot of swearing on this CD - so beware if you are offended by language.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Not dissimilar to the old PC game, Myst. It is short but sweet. Don't use the hints unless you've tried EVERYTHING or you'll beat it too fast and miss all the fun.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Like every follow on with a huge success, the Hunger games left this book a very big shoes to fill.<br />The first part... I'd say around alittle less thana half a book... is dead boring with too many details that at the beginning looks not important / interesting.<br />Only later &#34;the fire really catches&#34;, the details assemble the big picture and things starts to rock... then you just can't let it off your hands until the very last row that actually forces you to run to the computer / library and hope that they still have the third part available...<br />So if it's so good (at least at the end) why did I give it only 3 stars? because at the first half I almost gave up on this book.I read other series of books (e.g. millenium) and it wasn't that painful. But again, eventually it's a good book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved almost everything about this book.  I got the first installment on my kindle for free.  I was thrilled with the quality of writing.  I have been reading q lot of post apocalyptic and fantasy recently, and the quality varies tremendously in these genres.  This was a refreshing change.  Hugh Howey has a way of writing that is detailed, descriptive and engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the whole thing.<br />In order to enjoy this book it is important to be able to suspend disbelief somewhat.  The whole idea of the silo to be able to sustain a population, and maintain machinery and computers over hundreds of years is pretty unlikely.  It also seems pretty farfetched that the silo would be located where there is an infinite supply of fossil fuel, ore and minerals to manufacture everything a population needed over hundreds of years. I didn't have much trouble overlooking this, but some readers may struggle with it.<br />Like other reviewers, I also felt that the writing quality fell off somewhat toward the end.  Lukas needed a little more development and a little more backbone to make him who He seemed to be trying to be within the story.  Bernard needed to be a bit more sinister in order to justify his fate.  He just seemed bumbling and misguided in the end.<br />Overall, a great read!
B00BIVN82M|4.0|The album is good, but I think some of his early albums have been better. I will still add some of the music to my I-Pod for gym workouts!
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Overall a good movie. The way the movie ended was pretty awesome as well. This isn't the best Batman movie, but it is worth buying, and a welcome addition to your Batman collection.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|This CD more than met my expectations. Darius Rucker has a real winner with this one! I definitely use this CD at the gym for my workouts.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Anyone denying Kanye's utter dominance in the world of music is fooling themselves; the man is a trendsetter. Therefore, with such comparisons as to Steve Jobs, Michael Jackson, and various other prolific figures, rather than being braggadocious, Kanye is being honest.<br />Musically, the album is the future of hip hop; rather than relying on hi hats to provide momentum, Kanye uses deep bass/sub bass to drive the music forward.<br />Watch out.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Lady Antebellum never disappoints from one album to the next. Really enjoy listening to this CD. Think this group is great.
B00AJFEHAU|5.0|They really are a show stopping band. I have nothing but high hopes for these young men, they are kind and truly care for their fans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I want more of this game&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is SO much fun I love it so much&iexcl;!!!!!!! if you are reading this then..... you should get this game right now :)
B00CW665VI|4.0|This is fast and quite funny, I'm's a very easy read with great characters, defiantly worth your time and money.
B005LAII12|4.0|Not a movie for the young ones as the language is bad. The story is very cute and the Teddy is adorable. A real live nasty mouth bear.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game EVER its awesome I just wish it was cheaper  its  so expencive but it's worth it. Although you way not  have all the pieces when you start playing.
B001S86J0I|5.0|The actors do a great job of their characters which are copies of other Science Fiction characters. The plot is great and it is one of the funniest movies ever.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Amazing. The emotions, the story, the characters, the way the plot moves in such a feverish, urgent, yet slow and poetic. Just amazing.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I love everything about this book, and this series, and there is nothing I don't like.  So how could I give it anything but 5 stars?  There is a really good range of characters in these books and the character development flows really well.  Lots of humor and lots of suspense.  These are all people you would want to meet and know in real life.  The stories are intriguing and never dull.
B00847KFDS|5.0|John Fogerty is amazing.  This is an incredible album.  Every song done in a new way with various other artists.  It's a joy to listen to.
B002ECJZ76|3.0|This movie seemed really interesting, but it was really boring.  I couldn't finish the movie cause it was so bad.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Awesome toy I'm in my twenties, I love Dr who and I really have no complaints. One thing I did have to do though is file down the button to avoid the sonic going off every time I used the slide bar on it. It's made of cheap plastic but you really can't tell from far away I'd say 5 star otherwise and worth the price.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This is a REALLY good app (the videos rarely buffer) but the app itself is kind of jittery and slow, when the video is minimised if you move the screen up and down to look at the comments the video pauses which is kind of annoying and after the video has stopped it exits and goes to the home screen. I recommend an update with these things plus allowing the video to start of minimized first then choose if you want full screen. This is just me being picky but this does not mean that this is not an excellent app, i actually use this more than the sideloaded youtube app, great app just a few adjustments needed, it is definitely reccomended
B008XG1X18|5.0|I  have tried several new ideas from this site - love the new recopies, craft and home improvement  ideas... Tons of FUN...
B0018BB21G|5.0|The disc arrived in a package with several other Moody Blues CDs that I ordered at the same time.  The packagin for all of the CDs was more than adequate for shipment.  The music on this album is radically different than the groundbreaking &#34;Days Of Future Passed&#34; which preceded this release,  but all of the songs and narrations are truly wonderful efforts.
B0019IB0II|5.0|of an astonishing view of a brain in trouble! Read it before ever having a stroke gave me a sense of hope and determination to not be afraid. Reading it after having a stroke or to someone who has had a stroke is just what's needed to face the long recovery with courage and hope.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie resonates on so many levels! Jennifer Lawrence sparkles like the star she later becomes in this futuristic tale of dictatorial woe. With a smaller version of the U.S. segmented into twelve districts, each responsible for a primary staple of existence, the ruling party enforces a lottery which randomly selects a 12-18 boy and girl from each district to compete in a televised fight to the death. When her young sister's name is drawn, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) volunteers in her place. Teaming with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), Katniss' hunting skills with bow and arrow--along with their budding relationship--capture the imagination of the viewing public, who wind up rooting for these two &#34;lovers&#34; from district twelve. Lessons of  honor, courage, loyalty, dedication, skill, and hardships-overcome leave us with impressions which last far longer than the periodic violence. No sex scenes, no nudity, little cursing, rated PG-13 for violence.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is what I have come to expect from Big Fish.  I highly recommend paying the $2.99 for the full version.  I have really been enjoying it over the past couple of days, and can't seem to be able to put it down.  Thank God that they designed a good hint option, as when I got stuck at the beginning of the game it came in very handy.... (I didn't understand the way the clues wall worked.)  I'm looking forward to finishing the game.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|Phasing in and out of an escapist mind-set, we observe our framed innocent heroine incarcerated in an insane asylum that doubles as a dating service for the wealthy. Forced to dance before dignitaries and escort them around the asylum grounds, when the going gets too rough, Babydoll (Emily Browning) mind-shifts into a dangerous-yet-interesting series of quests which displaces her and her buddies into other places and times, with an eye toward either saving the world or escaping the asylum.  Will they prevail?
B007VTUYWW|2.0|It commits the worst offence an big summer action movie can. It's boring<br /><br />Just skip it, not worth your time
B005CMSDLE|4.0|I find this movie as fascinating for its locational, geographical aspects as for the intriguing concept of a teen exiting life-long training as an assassin to discover the world for the first time.. From speaking multiple languages, to dispatching a Seal team, to her hilarious first kiss, Saoirse Ronan takes us on a believable roller coaster ride of superb acting ability as she ventures into strange, new lands with the evil CIA chief Cate Blanchette hard on her heels.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It was a slow read and not really exciting one way or another.<br />It is not at the top of my list for recommendatiions.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Pure escapism of the most enjoyable kind! Excellent acting from Nicholas Cage and superb gymnastics from Chloe Moretz make this a fun way to spend one's time. Aaron Johnson turns in an amusing performance as Kick Ass, in which he portrays a teen convinced that his city needs a super hero--and he's going to be it! Dispite his early ineptitude, Big Daddy (Cage) and Hit Girl (Moretz) come to his rescue against the bad guys. After seeing this movie, I find myself looking forward to \\"Kick Ass 2\\"...just have to see more magic from Hit Girl Moretz!
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I admit I wouldn't have chosen this type of an app, but it is the FAOTD, so I downloaded it.<br />As exercise apps go, this is actually pretty good. I was able to figure out how to do the exercises with the videos and got a good workout in 30 minutes with several different types of exercises.<br /><br />I would prefer to be able to select the exercises I want, and then put them together in one routine, so the lack of customization lost a star for me.<br />However, there are plenty of good reasons to buy this app:<br />--No awful permissions! OK, this one alone is worth +2 stars, since so many developers are getting a bit lazy and starting with Android programming packs that include some pretty bad data mining software.<br /><br />--Clear videos - Easy to understand and actually see what the person is doing on my Kindle Fire. Admittedly, it is better on the 8.9 in. screen, but I can certainly use the 7 in screen. I am not so sure it would work on a cell phone. I would personally not be able to watch videos and workout with such a small screen.<br /><br />--Workouts that make you sweat, but not collapse. I am a beginner level exerciser and was able to complete the exercise routine at my level (even if it wasn't necessarily as fast as the person on the video did the exercises). If you are advanced, though, this might be too tame, or else you would want to do the exercises with weights or more speed.<br /><br />--Lots of little apps are together here - This one app includes the workouts from 5 other mini-workout apps. So, if you would like a few of them, this app gives you all of them for the price of 3.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good workout app that gives you a chance to work out on the go....but if you are really on the go, do you need a workout app?? If so, this is worth buying.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it so much its awesome every time it updates it turns into minecraft on the Pc but with no computer
193700788X|3.0|i would recommend this book to anyone reading the rest of the series but I must say I was not happy with the ending. people need to know it is nothing like the tv show on HBO
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I received the album a few days early from hanson.net, so I've been able to listen to it quite a few times through.  Okay, I've been listening to it for four days straight.  I love it already!  Sounds just like Hanson.  Favorite songs so far:  Tonight, Already Home, Tragic Symphony, Juliet, and Save Me From Myself.  I wish there was more Isaac, but that seems to be the norm now.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|OK it is about reincarnation and has some cool post apocalyptic things and it has tom hanks but all in all it is a yawner. sorry. i really wanted to like this movie.
B009ZQNN90|5.0|I love this movie! It was perfectly executed with great writing, great direction, cinematography and acting! It stands right up there at the top of my list of feel good movies such as  &#34;Driving Miss Daisy,&#34; &#34;Forrest Gump&#34;, &#34;The Birdcage&#34; and &#34;Mrs. Doubtfire&#34; to name a few. Who can complain about a feel good movie amidst a sea of gun violence and super-charged action thrillers?! Some American viewers may be hesitant because it is a British film and sometimes the accents can be so thick, that it's hard to understand the characters. Not so in this film. The actors are obviously all well-trained, serious actors that do such a good job of bringing these off-beat characters into your living room, you don't want the film to end! See it today for a does of &#34;feel good&#34; and cheer the team that made this film! No wonder it turned into a hit Broadway musical as well!
B0031RS2HC|5.0|this is the type of book that you can read without overtaxing you brain. it doesn't mean it is a stupid book. I found that I had a great deal of fun reading it because the story was straight forward, easy to follow and the characters are easy to differentiate. It is a first person read so I was trust into a very exciting world of a murder mystery. I will be getting more in the series and I hope it is as good as this.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|This flic is a bit corny but still really funny if you like those spook type movies. I swear this guy reminded me of Adam Sandler in &#34;Don't mess with the Zohan&#34;
B00BN3EE1O|2.0|I enjoyed the book but not the movie.<br />The lighting was so dark throughout the entire film, at first i thought it was for dramatic affect but then got frustrated trying to watch the whole movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how I can read 2versions in one sitting and be able to audio version as well, love it.I'm new kindle user so.....volume adjustment is hard to find, but surrendered bible.and like someone else said, makes me want to read more.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|I'm not surprised this is another hit.  I don't even hesitate, when I see a new Dr. Panda I buy it.  The grandsons love it and play for hours.  Doesn't matter how many new games I load on their Kindle Dr. Panda stays a favorite.
B004OEIL54|5.0|Scream started it off. Love this movie. From the storyline to characters, a different twist. Ghost face killer is awesome.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|After the first Dr. Panda there was no question that each one to come out would be a hit.  My grandsons love it and will play for hours. We now have 7 different ones.
B004OEIL5E|4.0|Like first three Scream movies. From classic horror maker. Love Jada in her second horror movie. Like I said classic horror movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a Pinterest addict!  I actually like using this version on my Kindle better than when I pin on my computer.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the book prior to watching the film, and was glad I did. The book is much better. Very well written and suitable for a wide age range.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Enjoyed reading the excerpts regarding Dr. Alexander's family and their reaction to his illness and near death.  Not so much all the scientific explanations of his illness.  The explanation of his time is heaven was unlike any I have read in other NDE accounts.  Interesting account in heaven.
B005F9TQ9C|5.0|Taken at face value, this album has much to offer. Dylan's voice sounds great, as does his singing. The choice of cover material is eclectic but usually satisfying. And the playing and arrangements are simple and effective. Nothing is forced or mechanical.<br /><br />Dylan followed &#34;Portrait&#34; with &#34;New Morning,&#34; which features 12 originals, many of them worth the wait. That said, few would take this album to a desert island if &#34;Blood on the Tracks&#34; was also available.
B007FEZQF8|1.0|I had no idea this was a comic book, not interested AT ALL! I thought it was a story, like the tv show, but it is just pictures and a few \\"bam\\", \\"umpf\\" thrown in, very disappointing, wish i could return it
B0098466CK|4.0|I love The Sword. As a band, they've progressed so much since their first efforts and they continue to grow and refine their sound beyond the retro \\"doom metal\\" genre they were pigeonholed into by their first few CDs.  Ironically, as they've embraced more of a Texas blues sound from their home state, their sound has evolved to something more reminiscent of the godfathers of metal, Black Sabbath.  At the same time,they don't sound like a tribute band branching out into original material. The influence is there, but not overwhelming.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a good CD from a good band. Possibly their best CD so far.  Great riffs, great sound, great lyrics, great sound . . .<br /><br />BUT the vocals. They're the only thing that seems to be holding them back from greatness. Yes, J.D. Cronise is a solid singer, and his lyrics are overflowing with awesomesauce.  But his vocal delivery falls short of the material. The lyrical content seems to demand a more theatrical, more traditionally operatic delivery.<br /><br />Hell, his lyrics are getting to the level of Iron Maiden, or Dio, and they need a delivery to match. Right now, it's like he's vocally playing rhythm guitar instead of lead, and these songs need a lead singer.<br /><br />His voice is probably up to the task, he just needs to cut loose and let the passion out. And there's evidence on this CD that he's getting there. You can hear hints throughout the CD, especially in Hidden Masters and Arcane Montane.<br /><br />But he ain't quite there yet.  I'm really looking forward to their next release, and hoping J.D.'s vocal evolution continues to develop.
0345349571|4.0|When we Homeschooled our kids, we looked for &#34;Living History&#34; books to read.  This one fully meets my standards.  It tells the story of the 14th century, from the perspective of a man who was actually there.  THis kind of book helps us realize that people, making decisions, create History.  A very good read.  Ms. Tuchman makes History come alive.  It only get's 4 stars because, when everything is said and done, this is a history book.
B00004Y5A8|4.0|These recording represent Bowie in transition from an unknown up to the verge of stardom.  Bowie hadn't developed his croon at this point; in fact he doesn't have much more than a shriek in some of the early recordings, even so it's a fascinating journey.  Bowie becomes a more confident and competent performer as the sessions go on.<br /><br />This album would be mostly of interest to Bowie fanatics, a casual fan should get the studio albums first.  If you can find the version with the third disc (featuring a concert recorded in 2000) get that one, that concert is very well done.
B007REV4YI|5.0|If you love him, you won't be dissappointed. The action, the suave, the &#34; Shakin, not stirred&#34; I always look forward to the next one!
0307744434|2.0|With so many reviews praising this book, I was so excited to read it, especially because I love the idea of a circus themed book.  But I was very disappointed.  (And, yes, I judged a book by it's cover.  Seriously, the cover was the best part)<br /><br />It was very imaginative. I love the concept of the black and white circus (hence the 2 start review and not 1), but the story didn't flow very well.  I found it a chore to read this book.  I feel like there is so many opportunities that were wasted.  A battle between illusionists could have been so exciting but instead of actually \\"battling,\\" one makes an illusion and the other tries to top it.  That's it.  I know it doesn't have to be like other books with actual fighting but this was just boring.<br /><br />And let's talk about Celia and Marco, the lead characters.  I couldn't like them, especially Celia who has the personality of a brick.  And their relationship was poorly developed and there wasn't enough specified why the two ended up falling in love.  They barely knew each other and for the longest time, Celia wasn't aware Marco was her rival.  There was no character development.  The whole book, Celia was flat and one dimensional.  Marco, not so much, but there was no development to his personality either.  This combined with no strong plot really hurt the book.  Also, Celia's father, Prospero, and Marco's tutor, Alexander, what's the story with these two?  Why do they feel the need to have their student's duel to the death?  Why don't we ever know the real Alexander?  What happened to Celia's father after all this? There's too many questions left unanswered.<br /><br />I do have high hopes for the movie though and would like to see it when it comes out.  For the people who like to read the books before seeing the movie, I recommend you skip this book entirely.
1476733953|3.0|The Wool series reveals the creativity and excellent writing skills of the author, Hugh Howey.  I enjoyed the overall plot, but felt that it took quite a while before I was \\"hooked\\" into the storyline.  There was, in my opinion, way too much emphasis on minor details in the first two books whose main characters, as it turns out, are very minor in the big scheme of the series plot.  My advice would be to find an online plot synopsis of Books 1 and 2 and then buy and read books 3-5 for the interesting part of the story.  The Shift series is a sequel to the Wool series, but I'm debating whether I have the interest and energy to sit through another 600 pages; I may just find an online synopsis and call it good.
B000SEH80I|5.0|This was a very enlightning book for me.  I came from a very dysfunctional family and my brother told me about this book.  It helped me to understand alot about my parents and why I always felt like &#34;the red-headed stepchild&#34;
B005OCFHHK|5.0|One of the best series of movies ever done. It was fun watching the characters grow up with my kids. My girls loved them.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love this game. Except you can only buy certain ponies with hearts. The only way to get hearts is by pestering your friends on line to join. As someone that plays just for my personal fun, there is no way I'm going to drag my friends on line for this game. I just wish there was another way to earn hearts.
B00AFOS9I6|4.0|Levine's conducting is wonderful, and Kaufmann is a great Siegmund. I liked the Sieglinde, too (Westbroek), and thought Deborah Voigt was a very fine Brunnhilde. The music is what counts here, and the use of close-ups makes the dreadful machine fairly easy to ignore.  -jdt
B000002KHH|5.0|Great to hear some of the best songs ever to be played by ozzy and the guys .  Iron man and war pigs  blow all others away !
B0060MYKTY|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best series to appear in years. The combination of music, sets, costumes, compelling performances, masterful writing, and dance makes this the most &#34;operatic&#34; series I think I've ever seen. (If you aren't wild about opera, then think of movies like &#34;Ben Hur,&#34; &#34;Lawrence of Arabia,&#34; and &#34;Cleopatra.&#34;) The actress who plays Lucrezia is so good that I'm at a loss for superlatives.  -jdt
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi this game rocks it is a good way to waste time!! I recommend it a lot it's FREE! Cool
B00947N6D8|5.0|My girls love this movie...and we do also. Really makes for a nice family evening for all ages. It was shipped fast and exactly as promised.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is cool I recommend it was easy to play but I would say sit up it makes it easy to play though
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|The books came wrapped up nicely with great shipping time. My wife is now ahead of the show and I don't want her to spoil it for me. She loves her books.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very fun game and easy at first, but that's what fuels the addiction! Great game for everyone and a great way to kill some time while feeling productive!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love your Crossfire better than 50 Shades!!!  Want to read more about the newlyweds! Don't leave me hanging for long, please!
B0053FANPY|4.0|Quality of movie a little on the dark side.  Not really sure if this isn't a copy.  Movie skipped in two places, which it should not do the first time watching it.
0399230033|5.0|Tge story is a perfect beginnr book. It is repetative so little nes can remember and follow along. It is a quick read that introduces simple humor that children will love. One if our favorite reads for iur daughter when she was little (1yr+).  Every library should have the book in it.
1476733953|5.0|I saw this book listed on Amazon as a top seller and my initial reaction was \\"not another post-apocalyptic book\\". But, I thought I'd give it a chance and I was glad I did. The plot is very intriguing and the characters are life-like. My rule for giving out 5 stars is that the book must drive me forward to the end. \\"Wool\\" does that. Although I wouldn't call this novel a \\"page burner\\", it does come close. I think the author may have been able to accomplish his goal is a hundred less pages or so, but that doesn't stop this book from becoming an instant classic.<br /><br />Another minor point is the way the chapters jump back and forth between different character's POV. As soon as I got into a character's mind, the next chapter switched to another. I understand the author's reason for doing this, but it got a little irksome.<br /><br />*** MINOR SPOILERS ***<br /><br />Unlike \\"The Road\\", this novel is not all gloom and doom. \\"Wool\\" is more optimistic and gives humanity hope. I do have a few minor points that were annoying me. Although the dimensions of the silo were never clearly stated, the silo has about 150 floors. When the mayor makes her trek down to the bottom from up top, she takes 2-3 days in each direction. I think this is unrealistic. I know she was old, but an average person in decent health would be able to do this in hours. So, unless the floors were double or triple the height of a modern building, this is unrealistic. I can climb over hundred floors in an hour or less in the gym. And as far as an elevator goes, I assume the \\"designers\\" of the silo didn't want to have fast travel and communication. So, they did not provide one.<br /><br />But, these are all very minor points. This is a great novel and one that all sci-fi fans will enjoy.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Very fun music and great songs. I really enjoy the rockin' violin music. A great album to try if you like alternative music styles or are very eclectic in your music taste.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is amazingly fun and addictive, I found it very entertaining when you are bored. I love it and cannot wait for more!
B008MM9630|5.0|I realy  like this game, just wish we could send gifts to others and that we could get more the the cow without having to use gold
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I think this game is a great brain teaser you have to look fast and react fast I just think it needs a little more time then 2 mins
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book really gets you motivated to learn more. A great way to get a foundation on learning the ropes and guides you to building something better if you choose to.
069111966X|5.0|The books is insightful in ways that you will grasp immediately and others that will take will require months or years to understand.  The structure of the text, which is very systematic and reads more like an encyclopedia than anything, surprised me at first but rest assured,  you have the right book.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Learned a lot. Great book to keep in your possession to review when you feel down and you want it to pick you back up.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I loved this movie so much!!! It's super sad at first but it gets better and its such a cute movie!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I the graphics are extremely extraordinary. It looks so real!! I love my horse named Champion after how well we are at  the competitions in My Horse!
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Scalzi continues to flesh out bot the characters and then other side of the universe. If you enjoyed the first books, you will like this one.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Love playing  Littlest Pet Shop with my cousin Lauren and Caitlyn Goodman or with my dog Marley on a rainy day!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Descent mediocre average game with okay controls and setup its vehicles are alright I guess. I am really indifferent on this game.
B005LAII3A|4.0|It's tough as bricks to disassociate the remake from the original. While watching the new TOTAL RECALL, I couldn't help but compare it to the Schwarzenegger film. And if you put nostalgia aside, this 2012 version doesn't really pale in comparison. Two main shifts particularly strike me. The first, obviously, is that Colin Farrell's \\"Douglas Quaid\\" isn't as imposing or, frankly, as charismatic a presence as Schwarzenegger's. Actually, with Farrell's Quaid, there's a more palpable sense of personal jeopardy. Second, there is no interstellar flight to Mars. All the action takes place on a post-apocalyptic earth. But there is a fun nod to Schwarzenegger's misadventure thru the space port checkpoint.<br /><br />If only them crusading environmentalists could use these dystopian sci-fi movies to legitimately get their point across, we may all be sustainability conscious by now. TOTAL RECALL presents another cautionary tale, evokes one more dark vision of the future. At the close of the 21st century, global chemical warfare has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. Living space has become the most valuable resource. Two territories remain: the impoverished Colony and the powerful United Federation of Britain.<br /><br />In a world of soulless synthetic police and corporate corruption, Douglas Quaid is a factory worker on an assembly line who dwells in the hard-up Colony. Quaid must every day commute halfway around the world to the UFB by way of the Fall, the sole means of transportation between the two territories. On the day he gets passed over for a promotion, a distraught Quaid visits Rekall, a revolutionary company that can turn fantasies into \\"real\\" memories. Perhaps inspired by recurring weird dreams, Quaid selects the secret agent package for his fantasy of choice. He gets strapped in.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original or read the source material - Phillip K. D!ck's 1966 short story, \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\" - then you're in for a sweet puzzle. TOTAL RECALL blurs the line between fantasy and reality, and I remember the surging anxiety I felt back in 1990 when Quaid is confronted with the possibility that he may be trapped in a dream state. So, I was saying, one paragraph back: He gets strapped in. But then the memory implant procedure is interrupted when the police busts into Rekall and begins to shoot the place up. Quaid springs into action and is shocked by how effortlessly he takes out the entire police squad. Douglas Quaid is now a man on the run.<br /><br />How does Quaid fit into the Resistance the UFB chancellor (Bryan Cranston) is so desperate to stamp down? Why can he suddenly play the piano? Is he really suffering from a paranoid disassociative break? There are fun homages to the Schwarzenegger picture (three-breasted prostitutes, anyone?). But there's enough of a divergence from the 1990 plot that you can enjoy it as a separate narrative. Okay, there's the occasional plot point obfuscation, but the screenplay has enough smarts, even if it's not as grand in scale, and I love that the set designs exude a dark and dingy Bladerunner vibe. Kate Beckinsale really sells the badass Sharon Stone part, and Kate may well be today's best action female star, she's so effortless and dynamic in her physicality. The film's best action sequence has to be the frenetic extended chase sequence with Beckinsale and Farrell, early on. Jessica Biel is also very good, although she doesn't get to exert herself as much as Beckinsale in the asskickery department. Colin Farrell presents a more believable character than Schwarzenegger's because he cuts a more average figure, which means that we relate to him better. I do feel, though, that Farrell gets a bit lost in the middle of all the big sci-fi goings-on. I wish his dial went past \\"stoic.\\" Maybe his character should've picked a more extroverted part, like a kindergarten cop or Danny DeVito's twin.<br /><br />Lastly, I'll say that the bead of sweat, and not the drop of tear, was more convincing.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- \\"Inside Mode\\" - an option to watch the movie with the occasional video insets that deliver specific behind-the-scenes insights from the filmmakers<br />- \\"Science Fiction vs. Science Fact\\" - Professor of Theoretical Physics Michio Kaku examines the real-world application of the film's future tech (00:09:26 minutes)<br />- \\"Designing the Fall\\" - going into the concept and design work that went into the colossal elevator device that travels to the Earth's core (00:02:55)<br />- Gag Reel (00:08:00)p of tear, was more convincing.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- \\"Inside Mode\\" - an option to watch the movie with the occasional video insets that deliver specific behind-the-scenes insights from the filmmakers<br />- \\"Science Fiction vs. Science Fact\\" - Professor of Theoretical Physics Michio Kaku examines the real-world application of the film's future tech (00:09:26 minutes)<br />- \\"Designing the Fall\\" - going into the concept and design work that went into the colossal elevator device that travels to the Earth's core (00:02:55)<br />- Gag Reel (00:08:00)
B001MKQS4O|1.0|Watched this last night.  They have him crying over the impending execution of the inhumane, barbaric murderers, yet never once crying over the brutal massacre, in their own beds, of the farm family and their children!  Anyone who would skew those values is plain evil, with some ulterior agenda.<br /><br />The movie depicts Capote paying a cash bribe to the warden of the state prison in order to get frequent access to the prisoners.  Oh really?  Is there any real evidence of that (not shown in the film) or is that just another Hollywood \\"device\\"?<br /><br />What about the parts of this story that are entirely left out?  What about Capote's earnings, career, and homosexual lifestyle BEFORE all this happens?  What about WHO, exactly, by Zionist name, is financing and promoting him at the time?  I couldn't pick up the name, background, and income source of his homosexual partner during all this.  Was it even mentioned in all of this film?<br /><br />Capote comes across as nothing more than an opportunistic, lying, amoral profiteer who enriches himself off of the death of innocents.<br /><br />Once again, out of Hollywood, we find a crime-related film that degrades the life of the victims and glamorizes the criminals.<br /><br />Minus 5 stars.  Do NOT let any children watch this, or pay one dime for it, ever.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|For the price, these things are amazing. I tote them around in my laptop for tinkering and fixing things here and there. I've used them to clean out my laptop, fix my glasses, and various other craft projects. A terrific investment if you're looking for some basic tools :)

6305127646|4.0|Val Kilmer. Russians. Clean fusion. Elisabeth Shue. Solid soundtrack. What more could you want?<br /><br />Well, there are some places that didn't run as smoothly, but this movie still holds up. Solid UK cast before it was the norm today. Kilmer playing several different characters and showing off his range with accents.<br /><br />Pretty solid<br /><br />It's no wonder Kilmer didn't \\"play\\" Jim Morrison in 'The Doors'. He WAS Jim Morrison.<br /><br />So have some fun with this title!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Great game. I'm so addicted to this game. I upgrade if I can't beat a level. I get new powers. What more do you want. Just get the game already.
0783230079|4.0|When you put together the right combination of people and the right surroundings , magic happens as it did in this imaginative film I enjoyed the acting and the theme of it very much. I wish I could tell Hollywood that you don't need to make a film an R rated film with filthy Language or horrible violence to have people really like it. I enjoy this kind of film very much.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't believe it ended in another cliff hanger. This book was awesome would definitely read again. Wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under 14. 5 stars hats off to E L James!!!! Can't wait to read fifty shades freed!!!!!

B004J4WKTW|5.0|The most incredible imaginative circus I've ever heard of! This book was whimsical and lengthy but worth traveling thought the maze to feel as if you were actually there.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|Wow, I just LOVE this CD. I mean, how refreshing it is to hear musicians of this day and age actually digging deep and making catchy, melodic music like this. Some songs have an 80's feel to them with power synths playing like they did back in THE DAY. Some songs have a 70's feel to them with beats and vibes like those of past easier days. The vocals in this CD are very good with catchy, pleasing melody lines. I really like the use of the trumpets with heavy delay effects. Keyboards also make good use of effects. What else can I say other than buy it! You too will find yourself singing and tapping your foot at this successful attempt of bringing back the pleasing, creative sounds of the past!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|It's a fun puzzle game with silly graphics.  I just wish there weren't in app purchases.  So I'll be uninstalling it.
B007XC9BSK|5.0|first off, micro drifters are expensive! if your kid is already in to them, you know they cost $6-8 for 3 tiny cars (at least half the size of hot wheels) for double or triple the price. and they don't have working wheels, just a ball bearing so they \\"drift.\\" so, if you've accepted this because your kid absolutely LOVES micro drifters, then you need the Mack storage case. it's lots of fun, it's a perfect place to store all the micro drifters, it's sturdy and it has a place to shoot cars out the back. my 3 year old LOVES it.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|What a great way to carry all your lego to grandma's house and a great way to store it when not playing with it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I think this game I so fun , it was not easy but I hate to admit it was hard . I'm happy to say I have a new favourite game I think it is fun and it will really entertain you if you're bored . This game will be fun for many people.

B00CFA227C|4.0|Bryan Singer has never been a filmmaker whose work I've celebrated and adored. It's not that his films aren't entertaining to some degree. However, they always seem to have an issue with pacing, which could just as well be blamed on the writers he chooses to work with. Most of them feel as if they lose their footing in the last act. His latest movie, \\"Jack The Giant Slayer\\" is no different.<br /><br />A younger farmer named Jack (Nicholas Hoult) accidently drops a magic bean under the floorboard of his shack, resulting in a monstrous beanstalk growing into the heavens and bridging the gap between a world of giants and the Earth. The giants want their land back, which was taken from them in battle centuries before. When a princess is caught by the vengeful behemoths, Jack joins the King's(Ian McShane) rescue team to get her back.<br /><br />\\"Jack The Giant Slayer\\" starts off well enough and establishes all the important characters and their motivations. Screenwriters Darren Lemke, Christopher McQuarrie, and Dan Studney even set up a solid foundation for their story to be told through flashbacks to the legendary events of the past that occurred between the giants and the humans.<br /><br />Instead of building up excitement and tension for the climax to the film, Singer manages to wind things down and then rev them up again. He can't seem to find a satisfying or fluid way to end his films. I ultimately blame this on Singer and not the writers because he's the one constant element of each movie of his this tends to happen with (the first two \\"X-Men\\" movies come to mind).<br /><br />The visual effects for \\"Jack The Giant Slayer\\" look good for the most part. There are spots that could and should have been better. The beanstalks and their foliage definitely looked animated in many scenes. I always walk away from these types of CGI fests wondering why or how filmmakers would leave certain aspects looking the way they do. I know it ultimately all boils down to budget and a production's deadline.<br /><br />The cast of \\"Jack The Giant Slayer\\" is filled with talented actors who give their all. Nicholas Hoult is enjoyable and likeable as Jack. Ewan McGregor has a lot of fun with his character of Elmont, the witty and loyal protector of the King and his daughter. Stanley Tucci does an excellent job of making you despise the King's devious confidant, Roderick.<br /><br />\\"Jack The Giant Slayer\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition 16x9 widescreen (2.41:1). The picture quality is clear and vibrant. The 5.1 surround sound is put to good use through the pounding of the giant's walking, the noises of nature, and other eclectic sound effects.<br /><br />There's some interesting bonus material included on the Blu-ray version of \\"Jack The Giant Slayer.\\" An interactive feature entitled \\"Becoming a Giant Slayer\\" sends you up the beanstalk to enjoy eight different behind-the-scenes featurettes. If you want to watch each one, then you must re-climb the beanstalk every time. Five deleted / alternate scenes are included as well. Lastly, we get a gag reel.<br /><br />\\"Jack The Giant Slayer\\" may lose steam towards the end, but the journey is still exciting and humorous. It's family-friendly fun and blends together fairy tale elements that will appeal to both girls and boys. Fans of damsels in distress and Disney Princesses will be pleased just as much as guys wanting an action-movie fix.roduction's deadline.<br /><br />The cast of \\"Jack The Giant Slayer\\" is filled with talented actors who give their all.

B00C5W3SBE|4.0|\\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" arrived in theaters to mixed reviews from critics and a B+ Cinemascore from audiences. It managed to more than make back its production cost and will be followed up by the inevitable sequel. Sam Raimi's prequel to the 1939 classic now hits Blu-ray and DVD, giving audiences either another chance to see it for the first time or give it a second look in the comfort of their own homes.<br /><br />In \\"Oz: The Great and Powerful,\\" a crooked circus magician named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) is swept away to a magical land. Upon arriving, he is mistaken as the mystical wizard who is foretold to be the deliverer of its people from the grasp of an evil witch (Rachel Weisz). In order to free them from her clutches, he must steal her magic wand. Oscar embarks on a dangerous journey to find the witch. He's accompanied by a flying monkey (Zach Braff) and a china doll (Joey King) on his adventures through the whimsical and dangerous land.<br /><br />As I said in my earlier theatrical review, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" uses every aspect of the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" movie it can legally get away with. You don't see any ruby slippers and the Wicked Witch's skin is a different tone of green, but believes me that's about all that's missing. The Wizard's Throne Room and even his fiery appearance to others will remind you of the 1939 film.<br /><br />It's obvious from the beginning of \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" that Director Sam Raimi has one goal in mind. He wants to create something new out of the framework of the original film. Raimi wants his movie to be looked at as the \\"official\\" prequel to \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Although it's technically \\"unofficial,\\" the filmmaker was successful in his attempt.<br /><br />The cast of \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" deliver energetic performances. Some critics have shared their unhappiness with James Franco and Mila Kunis in their respective roles, but I found both of them to be taking their characters seriously. Everyone in the film seems intent on helping Raimi bring his vision of Oz to life as an homage and worthy follow-up to the 1939 classic.<br /><br />The CGI for \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" could be better. Much of it looks artificial and animated. At the same time, this could be the intent of Raimi to possibly give it a dreamlike or unrealistic look. The colors used throughout the film are vibrant and lend a sort of cheerful air to the film.<br /><br />\\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition Widescreen (2.40:1). However, the beginning plays in 1.33:1 and black and white to mimic how the 1939 film started and then turned to color. The picture is clean and shines brightly with all the lush greenery Oz travels through and shiny gold he's inherited as the Wizard. There are plenty of great sound effects and a musical score by Danny Elfman to enjoy courtesy of a 7.1 surround mix.<br /><br />I would recommend \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" to all those looking to return to the magical land we haven't revisited since 1986's \\"Return to Oz.\\" It presents some old familiar characters and allows the viewer to make some new friends as they travel down the Yellow Brick Road. Although not perfect, it's fun the whole family can enjoy together.n the film seems intent on helping Raimi bring his vision of Oz to life as an homage and worthy follow-up to the 1939 classic.<br /><br />The CGI for \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" could be better.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is amazing in my opinion. Can You Escape makes you think about how to get stuff that you need to get out so you can, well, Escape! this is a really good app and you should get it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|At first it may take a whip to get the hang of, but eventually this becomes a fun puzzle game that requires you to search around for clues and codes. Unfortunately it only has 7 levels, but they should jeep you entertained for a decent while.
B004Q3SGWG|4.0|Very eye-opening.  Scary to think this actually happened.  James Franco gives a great performance.  Movie is slow at times, but still very much worth the purchase.
1939416019|5.0|I am currently on book three of the series Sorcerer's Ring. I absolutely adore this series and current own all 6 books in the series. I have recommended this series to both of my sons, several friends, and a couple of colleagues, who are all avid readers like myself. I have a difficult time putting these books down and the story makes me want to extend my morning elliptical workout just so I can keep reading.<br /><br />As each new adventure beings, the reader forms a deeper bond with the individual characters as they gain depth and breadth throughout the story.<br /><br />I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a well written, compelling fantasy series.<br /><br />CW
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Seriously!? Come on Amazon. For the second time in a week you send out an update to the app that crashes. You pulled the last one back. I assume the same will be done with this one in a few hours. No notification. No apology. Nothing. Heck, even your email support knows nothing about it. Excuses. Get it right. This is one of my favorite games and you have ruined it. Not only do you make us wait weeks longer to receive any updates to apps (versus availability in the Google Play Store), when we finally get it, it does not work. Wow.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|loved it it really keeps you guessing make sure you keep track of everything but its worth the time so posy it
0062014536|5.0|Okay, so I first have to say, this book was GREAT! I know there has been a lot of negative feedback, but many of the concerns have to deal with there not being a fourth book! As long as a fourth book comes out, I will ALWAYS give this series five stars.
B0086213XW|3.0|It's an ok movie. Did not get the depth of the relationship that Williams and Rogen was supposed to have. Felt they just got married too young and she met someone else. Didn't understand the recovering alcoholic sister in law.
B00CX1TSSO|2.0|I was surprised to see the rating for this movie and found the acting to be poor and cartoonish. It may help to know what the target audience was, but it came across like a bad TV special to me. It would make perfect sense if this was low budget, and would not be surprised if people found themselves regretting this purchase because the movie was that BAD!

0307346617|5.0|I've read tons of zombie books and have spent hours watching multiple zombie movies and none have been told from this perspective (er, multiple perspectives) and none have made me feel as \\"vulnerable\\" as this book has. I mean come on, every zombie fanatic has their \\"plan\\" in case something goes down. I, of course, had my own which as it turns out wasn't as great a plan as I thought. You got to read about the supposed apocalypse from eye witness accounts. Some of which were so vivid it gave ME nightmares >.> I NEVER get freaked out, but if you have a creative imagination, you have been warned xD
B002L5KKK2|5.0|I choose this rating, It had some true mean, kept you on the edge, Robert DeNiro played in it<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone 18 and older who likes action
B001N8V7KA|5.0|This is a great movie with a lot of suspense and action sequences and a reminder of the cold war. The fact that the movie is now over 30 years old hasn't diminished its entertainment value. However, I suggest that you don't embark on this adventure with a critical mindset because there is a lot of science fiction, which isn't realistic but it makes the movie all the more enjoyable. Eastwood is your favorite character in this movie, whether you recognize a nod or inflection from one of his spaghetti westerns or from the Dirty Harry series. The story and acting are exactly what you would expect of an Eastwood film and it's one of those that you will enjoy watching time and again.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This was a laugh-out loud book that had me reading excerpts to my family all day long. Yes, I finished it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down. Funny, poignant, sweet, and definitely timely, as women today are being deprived of health care, birth control benefits in the workplace, and protection from assault in the military service. Tina Fey has a knack for pointing out the faults and failures in our culture humorously, so that it's more of a conversation with friends, rather than a lecture from your boss. What a talented woman, pardon me, person. Thank you, Tina Fey.
B0055MBQOM|1.0|Let me say first that this product works well, it does a great job of calibrating monitors, I am a photographer and I use several different monitors and it has really improved the colour accuracy of my images.  However, there are several viruses embedded in the installation disk of this product.  My husband is a computer tech and it took him several hours to remove the spyware from my computer after I installed the program.  So unless you have a computer tech living in your home to help you out with this irritating problem I'd strongly recommend you buy a different brand!

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|While Zimmer lets loose on many of these tracks... it's the restraint that really comes through with \\"Man of Steel.\\" Zimmer isn't here to show off, copy Williams or toot his own horn... He's here to underscore a story of courage, heroism and (ultimately) humility. Tracks like \\"DNA\\" \\"Arcade\\" and \\"Flight\\" are general Zimmer fare, while \\"Goodbye My Son\\" and \\"If You Love These People\\" bring back the emotional melodies we loved in Zimmer's \\"The Lion King\\" and even some of his later PotC work. I can't recommend this soundtrack enough!

B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|Kayne  West is a  trip  because let his followers tell it he is the 2nd coming of something, what exactly i don't know, musically he is very calculating and is able to sample and loop past grooves and beats and make it work for his  own agenda, however he has always been a marginal rapper at best and to me  he has always been more gimmicky than  giving me the goods  to merit all the attention bestowed upon him.  this  album once again  tries to spin the musical gumbo and  it falls kinda flat.  he wants to be a voice for those in need of one and yet he wants all the trappings of his cross over appeal has generated for him.  if he were as Good Musically as he thinks he is  then he would be a incredible contradiction instead of coming off like a punch line.  bound with charlie wilson is a  good cut and i speak to him  putting something on here  that works, because alot of this is venting and aiming all over the place and nothing sticks.<br /><br />and i gotta wonder how many  more  albums and gimmicks are folks going to continue to tolerate from him before they say either bring the goods or close the curtains?  i just don't hear anything remarkable in his music to merit all the hype.<br /><br />i thought he was kinda interesting as  a Artist on his  first two albums and after that i can take and largely leave it.  he can always fall back as a Producer and maybe also as a COmedian.

B00DF0POXA|1.0|This album is total garbage.  Kayne is obviously living off the past success of his first two albums, which were phenomenal. If a new artist popped onto the music scene and debuted this album, everyone would call it what it is - garbage. But because it was done by Kayne, some people will buy it no matter how terrible it is.

B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is awesome. It keeps your mind working but still feels like you are enjoying yourself. Very stress free. If you like this game, also try bridges and free flow.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book has it all!  Intrigue, comedy, imagination.  Brilliant!  I loved it!  Hope you enjoy it and think about it.
B004GYY714|4.0|Very easy to use, but need more stations that I listen to. Maybe will get more stations as time goes by.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This a great product. Indicator LEDS to giving you 2 full charges when you do not have not AC<br />source. It works well and does what it has too. My only complaint is, is that it costs<br />too much... I had a Plantronics 975 and it INCLUDED a nice charging case.<br />I bought this because I needed it, and it does work well, I just feel it's a little<br />pricey.
B005F9TQ0Q|5.0|I really don't understand why this album is so underrated. It's the first one that deals with Dylan's breaking marriage.  Everything starts here and not on Blood on the Tracks. Songs like \\"Going, Going, Gone\\", \\"Dirge\\", \\"You Angel You\\", \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Wedding Song\\" clearly shows what was going on. If you don't want to shoot in the dark, search for the lyrics of the songs and see by yourself that there wasn't a break between this album and BOTT. After that, don't waste time and buy this album. I have a lot of Dylan's albuns, and for me Planet Waves is among the best albums that Dylan has ever made. In my opinion Dylan made a trilogy of albums that deal with his breaking marriage. It started on Planet Waves, grew on Blood on the Tracks, and ended at Desire. Very recommended!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This movie is really good and inspiring. The actors are awesome and the film itself is great. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a great movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very addicting! I would recommend this game to any bingo addict. One of the best bingo apps out there. I recommend!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Even when I thought I had it figured, I didn't. The drama is captivating. The relationships, intense. I grew to welcome these characters into my head, warts and all!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Bought this for my parents who love Andrea Bocelli!  They really loved this, even my 18 year old Nephew that lives with my parents loved it!!
B002RNOS2Y|1.0|UNBELIEVABLE, I wait a month or more to get the DVD... pop it in my DVD player, didn't work... tried another very basic DVD player... &#34;DISK ERROR&#34;<br /><br />I want my money back.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|it was the first time that I had read the book, and I shared it with my newborn grand daughter who love the narration while I inter acted with  the story.  the book was a lot darker than the movie, but not in a bad way, it just went more in depth to the witches evil. great book!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Over all I liked the game, there just isn't enough floors. If the game had lasted longer I would give 5 stars
B0094BB4TW|1.0|After two factory resets on my Samsung Strat 3, I have determined it's this app that is causing the problems.  When I attempt to check in, and scroll through the list of possible names of friends, I see at least 4 names on the list of people I do not know and are not my friends on facebook.  Nor are they even friends of friends.  I just finished a factory reset, did not sync any contacts (in fact I currently don't have any contacts in my phone for the app to find), installed ONLY this application and still see the strange names on the list.  I have checked the facebook mobile site with my phone and computer where I could check in, taken the same steps and do not find any strangers on the list, even if I search for them.  Same thing happens when I obtain the app from the Google play store by the way.  Deleting!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very addictive!! A very interesting A game I enjoy, alotI give it 5 stars!! I enjoy it very much!!! . I can't stop playing,  it!! I highly reccomend it!!
B00821OX98|4.0|Interesting television. Decent storylines filled with challenging decisions and acts of courage. It has definitely captured my 10 year old kids imagination.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game the combat is great and so is the web sling plus you can customize and upgrade your combat
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I picked this book for our book club.  We all really liked it.  It's a tough story but a very easy read.  It also gives you a different way to look at flowers.  If you have someone who likes a good character story, this book along with a bouquet of carefully picked flowers would be a lovely gift.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun game to play, never messes up on me. Very addictive! Great for passing the time when your board.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great book to read. The whole series was amazing. Couldn't put the books down until they were fully read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun and addicting game. It sucks that it only had a few rooms to solve. Can't wait for more
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was so engaging! Every second I felt as if I was in the book and that I just couldn't leave! I wish this book never ended! Now on to Mockingjay! I hope it's just as great! :D
B007SGM084|3.0|I finally broke down and bought the books. I had to see what all the hype is about. It's the story of Cinderella who has kinky sex! Every 3 Pages is another escapade. No plot at all to this. I am still trying to figure this one out. It's a romance novel w bondage. To each his own. It was a waste of $
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can never get enough of Eva and Gideon...Love  where Sylvia is taking this series. She's an amazing storyteller. Can't wait for books 4 and 5. You will not be disappointed!!!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This handy tool made it so easy to upload photos from the SD card to my IPad.  I highly recommend it.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I love this game. The best most interactive Bingo game available but I uninstalled it from my Kindle and only play on my desk top computer now. The Kindle version constantly booted me out,  froze and disconnected me from the game. Occationally, they refunded my lost credits (which cost real money) but most often they did not. Contacting support is an exercise in futility. They are the poster boys for customer NO service.  I read lots of chat and these problems are both universal and chronic as is the lack of concern by the support staff. I don't recommend it for Kindle.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|I just love it when these two get together and record. When you match the great guitar work of Joe Bonamassa with the outstanding vocals of Beth Hart, you just can't go wrong. I can't wait until these two decide to go on tour together. I will won't miss that. The cd is well balanced out with many different styles of their music. I don't like a cd that sounds the same all the way through. These two are talented enough to not let that happen, and that makes this cd worth buying.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|It's so easy to download and listen to songs from this site. I love the song. It's so upbeat and happy!
0345803485|4.0|I will have better idea of how much I like this book when I am done reading it. Till then.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|being disabled, this app is superb! Breaking down the exercises to the different parts of the body and choosing the amount of time you want to work on that part of the body is perfect! It's nice that she shows you how to do the exercise properly and the directions are below her to help you should you rather read how to. Many of the basics are what I have been given in PT so this is a motivator for me...10 mins on legs before going to another app :)<br />This is a great app and I was lucky to get it on a free app day! Thanks Amazon!
0684824906|4.0|I was too engrossed in being a teenager to ever listen in History class.  Now at the age of 70, I was mesmorized by the detailed life of Abraham Lincoln, the Biograhies also of his Cabinet and the breath-taking struggle that our country went thru during the Civil War.  I really enjoyed this book - it put a very \\"personal\\" spin on life behind the scenes for a President of US during war and especially the WEIGHT upon him and his Cabinet.  I didn't give it a 5 rating because it is very long and requires a Commitment from the reader when you start the first page.  ....I guess that some would not have the patience to complete it?????
B004SIP8JI|5.0|If you like a history in your live story then this is the one for you.  You'll enjoy Meg and Hugh they are wonderful together and so is the rest of the cast simply marvelous.  You'll will watch this often, especially if you need a little pick me up.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Love this game,best one yet.  I  am a big fan of the little candy eating dude.  Keep the games coming.
B008LFY6NI|3.0|Dissapointed because I have this on my iPad and it is fantastic, hope I get it to work on my kindle fire.
0425263991|5.0|I'm not much of a review writer, but I was just blown away by this latest book by Nalini.  I've been looking forward to it for weeks now and it didn't disappoint.  Don't miss this if you're a fan of the series &lt;3
0553386794|2.0|I watch the TV show with my husband and it's pretty good, but I just can't read the books.  I enjoy rooting for characters and watching them overcome the odds.  With the Song of Ice and Fire books every time I let myself like a character they killed or raped or maimed.  Too depressing for me :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best app I've ever had this app is so fun awesome app!!!!!!!!! (;(:(;(:(;(:(;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best app EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!really good app i love this app you guys should get the app
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I'm still excited about these stories. I find that the author teases you with several areAs in the book.  I notice I keep skimming ahead without letting story soak in because I can't wait to find out what happens.  Love it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! Everything works perfectly and its not to hard or to easy. My only complaint would be that it needs more levels.
B00CVFTDKU|5.0|This 8 episode drama kept me in suspense.  I couldn’t help but watch half the episodes all in one sitting and the rest the next day.  The story is well written and tight, filled with emotion and wrought with tension.  Tennant and Colman shine and the other actors do a superb job as well.  This is definitely a must-see and well worth every minute.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|I have been a serious music fan for more than 40 years and it takes an awful lot to impress me these days. The only reason that I picked up this one from my local store today as my first try with this band is that they will be coming to town in a few months and I wanted to get a taste of what it could be like other than watching You Tube videos from their 2013 European shows.<br /><br />The first track is agressive and \\"in your face\\". After that, the music is so brimming with emotion that it brought tears to my eyes and goosemumps on my arms on the first listen. For me, this is extremely rare! I cannot compare this band to anyone in my HUGE CD collection, which says a lot. As for the long time fans trying to be analytical, lighten up! If this music moves you emotionally, then just get it! if not, then consider going to the doctor and tell him that your emotions fell out somewhere along your morning commute!<br /><br />I will be attending the New Orleans show in October and will purchase their back catalog from Amazon within the next few days!<br /><br />Simply stunning!!!
0385349947|5.0|Thank you Cheryl for finally writing a truthful, excellent exampled book on why women continue to not take the leadership roles they should be in today's society.  Women can fill the management positions, whether it be corporate, non profit or other based positions and bring a different dimension to there work and home environment.  This should be required reading for high school!

B008JFUPK8|5.0|\\"Man Of Steel\\"<br />(Warner-DC, 2013)<br /><br />I went to see this one in the theater, with full-bore, big, loud 3D-IMAX, and it was pretty impressive.  I'd read a couple of harsh reviews slamming the film as a pile of slag, and I've never been that into the previous Superman movies, but I was ready to give it a chance: the trailer I saw months ago looked cool.<br /><br />So, yeah, it's pretty good.  The script is definitely on the serious side, tilting towards tragedy, and it grinds a little bit as they make absolutely sure we understand how tough Clark Kent's life has been. There are precious few light moments in the drama, certainly none of the slapstick seen in Joss Whedon's (excellent) \\"Avengers\\" and some of the plot points seemed excessively harsh -- the fate of Pa Kent, for example -- but all the grim realism effectively set the tone for the massive battle sequences, and that's where the heart of this film lies.<br /><br />This is a stunningly violent, amazingly kinetic film. I had thought Whedon nailed super-FX in \\"The Avengers,\\" but \\"Man Of Steel\\" takes superhero movies to a plateau several levels above anything we've seen so far. The on-screen destruction is massive, from the near-nuking of Smallville to the mega-9/11-ing of Metropolis, the digitally-produced havoc is truly epic -- at some point I realized I'd been immersed in nonstop chaos for about twenty minutes and I was still riveted and awed by what was onscreen. Very few moments looked awkward or dorky, the stiffness of motion that we've come to accept in high-tech action films was almost entirely smoothed away, and the impression of being there in the moment, keeping up with the speed and power of these thunderous metahumans was very convincing. The closest thing we've seen elsewhere was the forest battle scene between Iron Man and Thor, but this was that scene, cubed.<br /><br />In terms of translating the imaginative scope of comics-in-print into film, this was amazingly successful. They may have trouble living up to this film if a franchise begins, but they certainly don't need to re-re-reboot Superman again: they nailed it. Plus, Henry Cavill is a great Clark Kent.  Hopefully the Warner studio can resist the temptation to make the next film into an overwrought epic that brings Superman's story to a grand, premature conclusion (the curse of Hollywood superfilm scripts) and just have Superman have one adventure after another, and shed some of the darker psychological overtones. If they can sustain this level of impact and excitement, I'll go to as many of these films as they can make. I suspect I'm not the only person who feels this way.  In print media, superheros have endless adventures: why not in film?<br /><br />Anyway, if you've read negative reviews from professional film critics, take 'em with a grain of salt. I think this is a genre that a lot of cinema snobs just don't get... and the studios are only now starting to get a handle on. But \\"Man Of Steel\\" is definitely a big step in the right direction.

1781162646|1.0|I'm a fan of the Hard Case Crime imprint, a publisher of fast-paced, action-packed page-turners, and I'm also a fan of Stephen King's earlier works. What should have been a publisher-author match made in heaven is instead a dreary, plodding, flabby mess. Inexcusably for a such a short book, Joyland is incredibly slow to get moving. Eventually King gets around to introducing a mysterious (if somewhat improbable) murder with supernatural overtones. With those elements, fans of King will expect something truly creepy will emerge. They will be disappointed, because King is far more interested in stringing together clunky sentences of antique Carny slang than dishing up thrills. Worse still, King wanders off into an utterly cringe-worthy coming of age tale. Warning: you will get very tired of hearing about the narrator's ex-girlfriend. In the end, Joyland promises a spooky ride but sits you in the kiddie cars instead.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love it but it makes me cry every time. John Green is amazing with his words. I don't know how he has that ability but I love it.
B00BAWEGPW|5.0|Great book! I was so into it I read the first book in one day (I decided to wait until the next day to read the next one). The setting was very cool with the creepy house, all the hidden rooms, and the mysterious creatures. The characters were all different. Jared, age 9, was a trouble maker and because of that he was accused of doing all the stuff that the boggart (a common household creature who steals to make his home) was doing. Simon, Jared's twin brother, loved animals, especially his two mice, Thimbletack and Lemondrop. Mallory is the older sister and she has a temper. The story has a lot of action. There are no parts that are boring. The illustrations are very well drawn and very detailed. I think anyone who likes fantasy, mysteries, action, or animal fiction would like this story. This is one of my favorite books.
0385504225|5.0|Continuing the adventures of Robert Langdon.  Very exciting story.  No lull in the action.<br />The descriptions of our historical buildings and bits of information about early history were very interesting.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|over all great other than it some times over heats i like the colors it comes in marware did quite well
