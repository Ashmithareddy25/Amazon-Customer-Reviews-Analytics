B000IOM0WE|4.0|Detail is great.  You could easily, given a great deal of free time, count the stubble on Marton Csokas' five o'clock shadow.  Scenery is attractive and well shot.  Colors are rich.  Still something about this transfer holds it back from five stars.  Perhaps it is the slight but discernable busyness of the grain during sharp scenes or the slightly out-of-focus feel during the grain free scenes.  I didn't see this film at the theatre so maybe the transfer isn't at fault.  And these faults aren't at all distracting, I barely noticed them as I watched the film, but when compared to best Blu-ray discs Aeon Flux is a small step down.  Still recommended, still impressive, still an upgrade over standard DVDs; but not the best looking 1080p material out there. <br /> <br />(PS3 - 1080p projector - 92\\") <br />
B000HT3JNY|5.0|A very pleasant surprise, Click, is a movie that brings to the screen the story of a married man and father of two who is given the opportunity to skip all the unpleasant situations in his life, only to come to the realization that the phrase \\"Careful what you wish for\\" is meant to mean something...    <br />The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both. <br />There are the slightest hints of The Family Man starring Nicolas Cage. <br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />Adam Sandler, Kate Beckinsale, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Click is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  4 1/2 Stars <br />
B000JLPMPS|5.0|Wow, what a transfer.  The feature film quality of Unforgiven is flawlessly maintained in this release.  The source is perfectly clean; all colors, as well as blacks, are pure and natural.  There is a drastic increase of detail from the standard DVD.  Every wrinkle on the actors’ faces shows up and in this film there are quite a few wrinkles to look at.  (High Definition never looks so real and stunning as when it is fed all the details of an aging face.)   <br /> <br />Unforgiven was shot on film so slight and consistent film grain can be seen throughout and the picture lacks the same perfect clarity that can be found on digitally shot features.  But it is as good a reproduction of the film as it appeared in theatres as any I have seen.   <br /> <br />Recommended to any fan of the movie who is considering upgrading their standard DVD of the film. <br /> <br />(PS3 - 1080p projector - 92\\") <br />

0895260131|5.0|So, Muhammad more or less lifted the Koran from the Bible! The Muslim world turns out to not be as peaceful in nature as we were led to believe, and its true intent is to take over the rest of the world! So THAT is why the US must martyr itself to fight the Muslim world. I, for one, was not smart enough to figure this out for myself and needed Robert Spencer to put it all together for me. I get it now. See, the US is made up of Christians, and we are all peaceful. The Bible doesn't say anything about killing non-Christians, except for maybe Exodus 22:20, which states \\"He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.\\" ... and perhaps Jude 1:5: \\"will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.\\" I just remembered Revelations 2:26: \\"And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations.\\" Oops, I also forgot Revelations 2:27: \\"And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.\\" Come to think of it, there really AREN'T significant differences between Islam and Christianity. I should have known better, considering Muhammad used the Bible as his source for the Koran! Oh well! The truly scary fact is this propaganda has worked on so many of you loyal Fox News viewers, whose duty it is to defend Christianity. At least Spencer has seen some modest success toward his goal, which was to demonize \\"our enemy\\" in an effort to unite \\"Christian America.\\" Ever wonder: Why not a \\"Politically Incorrect Guide to Christianity\\"? Just keep on refusing to think for yourself, sheep.

My boss gave it to me as a gift and it has completely change my focus and priorities and slowed me down so I can enjoy life instead of just going through it like a robot not recognizing or enjoying anything.  The title is misleading.  The book helps you focus and look closely at things you do automatically without any regard or enjoyment.  I use this as a reference...going back to different chapters that apply to my current state.  I think everyone should own this book.

B0002SROSQ|5.0|I didn't get this album until relatively recently. Frankly, I was a little afraid of what this album would mean. Nocturama was solid  but certainly not earth-shattering. <br /> <br />Thankfully, Nick and the Seeds have come up with this little 2-disc, that not just relieved my apprehension, but delivered beyond! For those of you still a little in love with Boatman's Call, this is a great new side of the band, brooding in a whole new way and rockin' while they're at it! Here's a great example of a band that keeps on growing and learning and just keeps on getting better with time. Every track on these 2 discs just grabs you in a unique way. <br /> <br />Abattoir mixes elements of gospel, southern rock, blues with a Tom Waits-ish twist. Lyre transitions with a track that blends a sound between the 2 discs and then weaves into a folk-like manner of song for the rest of the album. The track, Breathless offers an original use of flute that adds an innocence not often heard in their songs. <br /> <br />Hearing this album is like a wayward soul that has has found redemption. And how sweet it is!
B000001Y16|5.0|This album is truly phenomenal. Basically the last album Tupac himself put together before he died, he sets the entire rap industry upside down in the opening track. The way this album opens up is truly crazy. He sends a straight shot message to big nas n mobb  that he had the balls to take the violence to the level that eventually killed him... freaking insane... after the hairs on my neck settled he stops to pray, his \\"hailmary,\\" and adds 10 more bone chilling tracks to a classic that will live on forever...
B00003CXA2|5.0|Wow, this is one of my all-time favorite films and in my opinion, one of the best made. I remember when this movie first came out and my mom, grandmother and I went to see it in the theatres. Being a very young teen at the time (around 13), there were some things about the film that I missed or didn't quite understand, but I nevertheless loved it. As the years went by, I watched it several times and it got better and better. It's one of those timeless movies that should be put in a time capsule. \\"Forrest Gump\\" was the winner of \\"Best Film\\" in 1994. I still can't believe it's been 13 years since this movie came out. Everyone at my junior high at the time loved the film and even voted it as their favorite for 1994. There was even a popular guy at school whose nickname became \\"Gump.\\" There was quite a \\"Forrest Gump\\" craze after the movie came out, from \\"Bubba Gump\\" shrimp hats and shirts, to cookbooks, to Gump documentary books. The movie spawned popular phrases such as \\"Stupid is as stupid does,\\" \\"Life is like a box of chocolates....you never know what you're gonna get,\\" \\"Sometimes there just aren't enough rocks\\" and \\"We was like peas and carrots.\\" <br /> <br />For those of us like me, who never grew up in the 1950's and 60's, \\"Forrest Gump\\" is the perfect way to lead you through a decade of some of the most important events and people of that time. We see these events through the eyes and life of Forrest Gump, as this extraordinary man seems to come across some pretty historical marks just by living his innocent life. Imagine meeting Elvis Presley in your own home, or sitting next to the likes of John Lennon? Tom Hanks (one of the best actors you could watch and one of my all-time favorites), plays Forrest Gump, a challenged man with a rather low IQ who has always been subject to discrimination since he was a boy. His adoring mother, played by Sally Field (another one of my very favorite actresses and one of the best around), with her gentle personality, is always there to remind Forrest that he's no different, and refuses to let anyone treat him differently. The only person other than his mother who accepts Forrest is Jenny, an innocent girl with her own demons at home, whom he met on the bus as a boy. Together, they grew up and even though they led separate lives, they still remained close and had a good relationship. Forrest played football for Alabama and got to meet President John F. Kennedy. In Vietnam where he endures the hardships of war, he befriends a challenged, shrimp-obsessed soldier named Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and a rough talking, bitter Lieutenant named Dan Taylor (a magnificent and intensely real performance from Gary Sinise). And he gets a special medal from President Lyndon Johnson after some heroic efforts during the war. Oh, and he also becomes an expert ping pong player, a shrimp boat captain, a witness to Watergate and he makes a seemingly tireless run across the states gaining faithful followers along the way. Jenny (a stunning performance from Robin Wright) meanwhile, has become a bit of a drifter and a druggie, hanging around with the likes of hippies and men who enjoy beating women. She frequents clubs, sells her body and plays folk music. Though she and Forrest's worlds seem to lead in totally different directions, they still seem to find their way to each other. And keep your eyes open for a very young Haily-Joel Osment who plays Forrest's little boy. <br /> <br />\\"Forrest Gump\\" is both a comedy and a drama. It has a lot of everything in it from the poignant, emotional scene of Jenny throwing rocks at her childhood home where she was abused, to Forrest showing his buttocks battle wound to President Lyndon Johnson, to Jenny's fight with a terminal illness, to Forrest's bulldozing over of the Alabama cheerleaders in the endzone after his touchdown run. This film is all about destiny and handling that destiny no matter what the outcome of each event is. It's a story of heroism and loyalty, of loveand acceptance, of trial and error. It's about tackling complexity with simplicity. There is so much going on in this film that I could write a novel about it. It covers so much ground; such huge events from the past as seen through rather innocent eyes. Forrest seems to tackle each challenge in life with his innocent ease and is the type of person who just takes it like it is; just do it and don't turn back. This film has so much to offer that it truly begs you not to become engrossed. And the acting is so real, you feel like you're in the film. It is a great \\"period\\" film, as you can see all the styles from the times; the peace signs, the side-burns, the cars, the old south. Everything is captured so nicely. And the film has extraordinary special effects that involve real footage from the time period wrapped around Tom Hanks as Gump. You can see how all the special features were done on the second disc \\"Behind the Magic of Forrest Gump;\\" a disc loaded with extras including screen tests, the making of the film and how they wanted it to appear, all the work to do the props, all the special effects with amazing computer technology, how the makeup was done, and on and on. They cover just about everything. And of course, I must mention the soundtrack, which I believe is a two CD set since there is so much. There are awesome tunes from the war period of the sixties such as \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\" by The Byrds, \\"California Dreamin'\\" from The Mamas and The Papas, and \\"Fortunate Son\\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Later on into the late 70's and early 80's, we hear such hits as The Doobie Brothers' \\"It Keeps You Running,\\" Fleetwood Mac's \\"Go Your Own Way\\" and Bob Segar and The Silver Bullet Band's \\"Against The Wind.\\" <br /> <br />Okay sooooo my fingers are out of breath. I have to stop. Can't speak enough of this great film with all the trimmings you could want. Director Robert Zemeckis is brilliant! A good movie? Hardly. An all-time classic? Definitely.   <br />
B00003CXBK|5.0|I had only seen two works by Miyazaki prior to Princess Mononoke. I already knew that Studio Ghibli produced really terrific anime, and that Miyazaki had a knack for presenting film moments that make us sign in that part of us that senses wonder.<br /><br />This film has, bar none other, one of the most enthrallingly magical sequences I have ever seen: the section in the heart of the forest where we see the forest spirit as NightWalker. These few cinematic moments were, to me as a Christian, almost holy. The film is of a different myth/religion, but it captures that ineffable, that transcendant, that wordless experience where part of you KNOWS that there is truth there, that there is something beyond atoms and molecules, and it is powerful and necessary and benevolent (although it can destroy, as we later see with the Forest Spirit). It is a moment that made me think of 60's psychedlia--a bit--and the special taste of clean night winds in moonlight--a bit--and the way you feel when you've prayed a powerful prayer.<br /><br />You have to see it to understand. It's the combination of color, music, pacing, editing, expression, and the sheer otherness of this deity (I'm not Japanese, so the Forest Spirit, tree spirits, these things have a strangeness that was exhilirating.) I don't really know how to analyze properly how Miyazaki did it, but he captures a holy moment that transcends the story itself. Amazing.<br /><br />Anyway, this site has numerous summaries of the plot. I'll spare you mine. I'll simply say that the outworking of this quest story, a story of man vs. nature, man vs himself, and the place of humanity within the natural context, is very powerful and extremely beautiful. Even dubbed, you will be captivated.<br /><br />There is a moment near the end where there is this pause--many seconds passing when you wait, wait, wait and the screen seems not to change. And you find yourself hoping, praying for a change. And when the first perceptible changes come, it's such a relief. Such an answer to prayer.<br /><br />This film is like an answer to prayer. It says things we need to listen to, and it can speak to folks outside of the Japanese culture and the nature religions. Good is sometimes supremely good here, and evil is...not always purely evil. Sometimes, it's just ignorant or selfish or unthinking...or somehow motivated by higher motives. And that shows a filmmaker with compassion and understanding of how people work. And of how the larger cosmos works, too.<br /><br />I can't recommend it too strongly. A work of art.<br /><br />Mirto prayer.    This film is like an answer to prayer.

0517548232|5.0|Before I give my own review, I'd like to respond to just two posts -- <br /> <br />\\"incredibly misleading\\" -- This reviewer said Hazlitt contradicts himself by arguing that an inefficient and unneeded industry should go out of business to free resources for more productive and needed ones, but at the same time lamenting the collapse of an industry due to minimum wage laws.  However, an industry that goes out of business because the market no longer demands it is not \\"unemployment.\\"  The reviewer's quote from the book about \\"releasing resources\\" explains itself -- employment will simply be shifted to more efficient and needed industries.  On the other hand, minimum wage laws increase the cost of labor for employers, reducing the number of other workers they can hire, creating true unemployment. <br /> <br />\\"libertarian polemic\\" -- Aside from the fallacy of argument by political labeling, this reviewer makes a point worthy of consideration -- markets aren't always rational.  This is true, and we see plenty of irrational behavior, particularly in the short run.  However, it has been shown time and again that the market behaves largely rationally over the long run, which is the time period that counts.  Producers which truly provide demanded value are rewarded.  The tech sector is a good example -- all these computers, software and communications infrastructure streamlines operations in all industries, and the nerds are handsomely rewarded for it.  If markets were primarily irrational, we would not have the propserity we have today.  Irrationality is the exception, not the rule. <br /> <br />So my review.  I'm an undergrad at an institution with a highly regarded economics program, and though my major isn't economics, I took some classes in that department to help fulfill my humanistic \\"artsy\\" requirement -- though at my school, economics instruction is heavily calculus-based.  While many of the arguments in Hazlitt's book jibe with the results of the math I learned (most significantly that a price floor, like a minimum wage, creates a shortage), I only learned what everything meant conceptually, in plain English, by reading the book.  Hazlitt also does a great job explaining the connection between the effect of artificial price and quantity controls on individual consumers/producers and the behavior of the economy as a whole -- something altogether lacking in the untenable but popular separation of macro from microeconomics.  In fact, Hazlitt pointed out that consumers are really producers, that demand and supply are two sides of the same coin, something that my teachers never bothered to illuminate in class.  You produce what you need in exchange for what you consume.  You export what you produce so that you may import what you consume.  In the end, as Hazlitt himself notes, it's all common sense. <br /> <br />Overall, this book is a really great supplement to an economics education, and I recommend it highly to fellow students.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|We really liked this when we first got it.  Then we noticed after a couple of months it would not hold a charge.  I no longer had the receipt so I couldn't even bring it back to the store. <br /> <br />It would be great if it weren't for the battery.  We never overcharged it either - just a bad addition to what would've been a good product.

In the end we have taken on too much and we feel like we're going in circles getting nothing done.  <br /> <br />Some people need to be given routines- to see how to organize our times so that we don't fail. Once you know the system it is so easy to adjust it so that it can fit into your own life.  <br /> <br />I have been to Flylady's website and I still went out and got the book. I enjoyed reading it even though I had heard most of it before.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|No matter your feelings of the woman, there is no doubt that Madonna is a true icon. She proves it like never before in her unbelievably amazing Confessions Tour. Easily the best tour of her amazing career, Confessions showcases not only her uncanny ability to simply CONTROL all aspects of her show, but also highlighting her unreal ability to sing wonderfully, while dancing some unreal steps. She is truly amazing, and if you didn't have the chance to see her live (or only saw the unfortunate edited version of her tour), I urge you to purchase this DVD/CD. For the price, it's unbeatable, and you really won't be disappointed. Madonna is truly at her best with this show, at the age of 48. I can't wait to see what she has in store...
0767817486|3.0|Stone won't make himself vulnerable to anyone or the facts, whether that means eliminating all JFK conspiracy theories other than his own or simplifying a story and people as he has done here in Midnight Express.  Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect.  [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision].  Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans.  Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained.  Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada).  To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').      Instead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts.  It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie.  Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice.  The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil.  They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when hereplies that his hands are tied.  There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture.  Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen.  Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film.  The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone.  Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.    The differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a \\"true story\\" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims.  Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: \\"The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs.\\" and, \\"I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'\\"
B000EQ5SR0|3.0|After hearing terrible reviews and comments saying that this was the worst movie of all time, i figured I would buy it and probably like it. (One critic complained that she was sneaking around while wearing a bright white uniform. Yes she was... while hiding in a bright white building!!! Its called camouflage people. Black outfits dont make you invisible.) Anyway... The movie does explain why, in the animated series, she can die and be back the next show and why she and goodchilde are enemies at times and lovers at others. There were a couple plot twists too but overall the movie seemed a little too stiff. I wanted to really like it and ended up wishing I had just rented it. Still, it wasn't bad, just not great.

1400064287|5.0|Reading through the unanimous praises of this book by other 'Amazon readers' I cannot help but feeling that this book will 'stick' i.e. be one of those few books which stays on the shelf and which people will continue to read for years to come.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because it tries to explain to us something so many of us want to know. i.e. how to get our ideas across to others in a way which will be memorable and inspiring.<br /><br />The authors tell us our messagees should be Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotionally -effective,Story- Containing.<br /><br />The authors warn against the abstraction which comes from knowing a field too well, and giving the inexperienced what they don't really need, an over- general view.<br /><br />Their focus is on concrete examples and the book is rich in them.<br /><br />The question of how each reader will personally apply the examples and whether or not they will make them work is another question.<br /><br />A personal note. I doubt that I myself will be able to employ these lessons in a very effective way though I recognize their value and importance. I tend to be an over- abstract person who loves the general conclusion and often provides the main - point and give - away at the beginning, thus destroying at the outset the principle of surprise.<br /><br />One of the Heaths' major points is we have interest in something when we ourselves do not know the outcome, want to predict it ourselves, try to make a guess as to what will happen.<br /><br />I think a lot of people will enjoy and learn from this book. And again I think the book will stick around for a long time.

B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Park made it's way to popularity around 2000 with the album Hybrid Theory.  It became a major hit, eventually going diamond (10x Platinum). <br /> <br />First off, let it be known that Linkin Park isn't metal.  They use some elements of metal, but they shouldn't be classified as metal.  Pure metal would be the well-known bands of Iron Maiden, Metallica, Dream Theater, you know...  If anything, LP could be classified under Alternative Metal along with a huge majority of bands today.  Anyways, LP's first album was a decent one, however, there were a few issues I had. <br /> <br />1. Papercut - 10/10, starting off with a kickass track, one of my faves to this day.  Mainly one of pure rap <br />2. One Step Closer - 7.5/10, never really got into this one that much <br />3. With You - 8/10, good track <br />4. Points Of Authority - 8.7/10, I honestly prefer the Reanimation remix <br />5. Crawling - 7.6/10, it was cool the first time, but got annoying and over-rated very quickly. <br />6. Runaway - 8.9/10, this one seemingly gets a lot of playtime on radio despite not charting well on either rock chart.  Not too bad of a track, though the yelling portion near the end should have been reworked around  <br />7. By Myself - 6.8/10, eh... <br />8. In the End - 10/10, probably LP's best track.  Once again, it's another mainly rap-track with Shinoda.    <br />9. A Place for My Head - 9.2/10, this track starts off with a western-styled beginning before the beats and guitars come in.  Has a good \\"scream-out\\" line, but it doesn't compare to Zach De La Rocha's infamous line near the end of Rage's Killing in the Name. <br />10. Forgotten - 9.4/10, another good track, not really much yelling portions. <br />11. Cure for the Itch - 9.5/10, heh, instrumental.  Doesn't really sound like most of LP's other work.  In fact, it probably sounds like an electronic band.  Well, the only thing that could have been down here is to lengthen the song...5 minutes of this to jam to. <br />12.Pushing Me Away - 8.3/10, good song, but it kind of doesn't have the flare that songs like Papercut, In The End, and a ton of the Meteora album has. <br /> <br />Some of you may have a special edition CD which contains 2 songs \\"High Voltage\\" and \\"My December\\".  I personally haven't heard High Voltage, but My December is pretty awesome despite being a lot softer and slower than most of LP's work. <br /> <br />Linkin Park's works deals with angst and anger.  They might not be for everyone.  If you enjoy hard rock with a flare of rap, you can try this album out and maybe pick up Meteora as well.  If you are looking for true metal like Metallica though, you probably will be dissapointed. <br /> <br />There's nothing wrong with trying out though.  Don't just stay away from a band just because they get too much attention on MTV and the radio.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This was an amazing movie.

B0001I55OC|3.0|I was glad to see that most reviewers realized that director Richard Donner (16 Blocks, Lethal Weapon, Superman) was to blame for turning a perfectly good Michael Crichton story into an episode of Time Tunnel. I knew something was wrong when Gerard Butler (Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie) - a talented actor - who plays archeologist Andre Marek, was reminding me of Mel Gibson from Lethal Weapon. Like so many actors before him, he was momentarily seduced by the Richard Donner \\"let's forget the script and just ad lib\\" school of acting. I think he finally does overcome the Donner side of the Force, and turns in a good performance in the second half of the film. But there's a lot the audience has to endure until we get to that point.<br /><br />Like 14th Century English soldiers being understood by 21st Century English-speaking scientists, and vice versa! That's seven centuries! (We can barely understand our own parents.) So the believability factor is quite low in this pseudo sci-fi thriller. It would have made much better sense to make this a fantasy film, left out all the fake scientific stuff, and gone straight to the battle and love story, which are the best parts anyway. That said, there are some problems with the historical side of the story as well. Even with all the extra features praising their own efforts at research and authenticity, I felt like I was watching a modern day Renaissance Festival, rather than real people living in a real era.<br /><br />But the battle at the end is exciting; and Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Me Without You) as Lady Claire and Gerard Butler as Marek do hold our attention as they woo each other, as does Paul Walker (The Fast And The Furious, 8 Below) as Chris Johnston, the son of the scientist they've all gone back in time to rescue. The rest of the cast is just okay. Even though Frances O'Connor has third billing, I found her to be too hysterical for a scientist. More Donner influence, I'm sure.<br /><br />If you have any interest in science, history or good filmmaking, you may want to avoid this one. But if you don't mind totally escapist fare, and like Gerard Butler, Anna Friel or Paul Walker, you may find it somewhat enjoyable. It has so much potential that it is a real shame Donner didn't take his job more seriously. So this is one that someday may make a good remake.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithhistory or good filmmaking, you may want to avoid this one.

B000089RVX|1.0|I liked this album when I was 12 and didn't really have much exposure to... well, good music. Roughly four years later, I tried to listen to this album again and wondered when it began to sound like the same song on repeat. I come to the conclusion that the only people who can truly appreciate this album are those who are intensely satisfied with their complacency in accepting the over-produced nu-metal ~innovations~ that popular culture throws at them. Anyone with good taste doesn't have to think, or listen, much to realize just how genuinely sub par this album and band are. And if you admit to liking this album, at least don't call it metal (gothic or otherwise) because it's not. It's pop. If you want to hear gothic metal, try Nightwish, for starters.<br /><br />You can argue that this post has, thus far, been more of a criticism of Fallen's audience rather than it's content. I guess it has. But there's really not much to say about the songs; seriously, imagine the same song on repeat, except for the two awful piano ballads which are essentially the same song. The hollow, everyday \\"oh-I'm-so-sad-and-I-want-to-die-but-I'm-just-writing-this-garbage-as-a-lame-grab-for-attention\\" and \\"YOU-HURT-ME-SO-I'M-GOING-TO-SING-A-LOUD-GAWTH-CHICKRAWK-SONG-ABOUT-HOW-MUCH-U-SUCK\\" lyrics can't save the completely uninteresting, cookie-cutter riffs. I don't feel connected with the band at all; the focus here is most definitely on Amy Lee, who really isn't even likeable, and whose voice isn't even that great--sorry kids, but being able to sing loudly doesn't mean you are talented (if you disagree, I dare you to listen to Lee singing  live). Also, Evanescence seems to aim for a certain degree of political correctness; their intention was to widen their audience to teenagers of holy rollers who are intimidated by Evanescence's DANGEROUS GAWTH TOPIC image, I guess.<br /><br />Yes, they're popular. But consider this: Galileo was once put in jail when he proposed that the earth revolved around the sun (heliocentrism), when 'popular' belief was that the sun revolved around the earth. If both Galileo and the masses who criticized him were alive now, I wonder who would be laughing.
0142000655|5.0|This is, in my eyes, Steinbeck's great American saga.
B000FTWB7G|1.0|Just as empty and generic as their previous album. Decided to give it a listen because of some insane impulse to give this band another chance. I said it once and I'll say it again: being able to sing loudly does not make you talented. Amy Lee's voice is still highly overrated, the music is still terrible, and the lyrics are completely uninspired (I don't know what's worse, the deviantART-like suburban teenage angst lyrics on Fallen or spoon feeding the listener like the lyrics on this album do). At least now there's not the whole \\"oh, we might be Christian but then again no\\" garbage. However, the brownie points awarded for that are taken away in surplus because of the way they butchered my favorite Mozart song in Lacrymosa. Way to go, guys! <br /> <br />What it comes down to: this band fails at having decent, or even acceptable, vocals, instrumentation, or lyrics. This album really isn't worth your time or your money, unless cheap pop is your thing, in which case you will love this album to pieces. Oh, and I'd also recommend the likes of Linkin Park to you too. Have fun with your hollow nu-metal.
B00005OM5L|5.0|One of the things I appreciate about us humans is how differently we see things. The previous reviewer, Joshua, berates this DVD because \\"Clapton's playing in I Shot the Sheriff was so bad I had to turn it off\\". In my view, the solo in that song is one of the best I have ever heard - Clapton's playing here is nothing short of gut wrenching in it's beauty, virtuosity and emotion. To me it is easily the highlight of the entire DVD. That this same solo could move another to turn off the DVD in disgust is beyond me. To each his own. I'd be very interested to know what Joshua considers a good guitar solo.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I went and saw this movie with the notion of its been nominated for so many awards. Let me tell you something this movie will take you through every emotion that a human is possible of having. The acting is superb. Brad Pitt gives the performance of his career.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|As someone who was just born as Cream was breaking up, I always felt I truly missed something by not seeing this great band in their prime. This DVD, however, truly shows that I didn't miss a thing. Cream is very much NOW in their prime, and with all the years experience they have, their musicianship shines through. What a rare treat to actually see Ginger Baker sing \\"Pressed Rat and Wort Hog\\" (something he never did all those years ago). You can't miss with this one. Whether you were there in the 60s, or born in the 90s, this one is a must see, must have for everyone...a true piece of history.
0226264211|5.0|I have seen some old interviews with Milton Friedman and read a couple of his books; including this one. <br /> <br />Not only is the content of this book interesting and enlightening, but the presentation is well done too. <br /> <br />There have been very few authors and public speakers that have caught my attention as thoroughly as Milton Friedman.  I highly recommend this book.
B00005MKA3|5.0|Imagine if we could get a cd full of new Bob Marley songs.  Well, this is about as close as we're going to get.  Most of the songs here haven't been heard by the general public or even most casual fans of Bob Marley.  It's a shame and at the same time a blessing.<br /><br />For as great as Exodus is it does get old hearing the same Marley songs over and over.<br /><br />But are these songs any good?  Yes!!  They all fit together nicely and the sound is top notch, since this is one of Marley's latter releases.  The remastering is also outstanding - something we've seen with all the Bob Marley remasters.<br /><br />So, if you want a somewhat new Marley experience and you haven't heard Survival then you're in for a real treat.
B000C4SHRW|5.0|I realize that this book is geared towards young readers, but as an adult, I also found the story interesting and well written.  While I would like to discuss some of the unique aspects of the book that captured my attention and imagination, I will refrain so as not to spoil it for somebody else. <br /> <br />Although this is written for young readers, it is a good train or plane book for adults as well.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah's third album is by far the most varied in musical styles.  She does a great job on this CD.  The videos on the deluxe edition are also great.  I can see Norah now holding all 6 grammys.
B0000029GA|5.0|please,please,PLEEASE disregard anything that these little kids are saying about this album.  They have absolutely no idea what they are talking about or better yet what real rap music is. This is easily one of the best rap albums of all-time if not then it is definitely up there in the top 5.  The fact that this album is still being mentioned 13 years after its release should speak for itself.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I can not remember the last time I listened to an album over and over again like this.  Every song on here, yes, EVERY song is pure perfection.  Amy Lee has one of the most gorgeous, strong, soaring voices I have ever had the pleasure of listening to.  The music is so dramatic and beautiful.  I listen to this in the morning when I wake up, in the shower, in the car on the way to work, at work, it's just that versatile.  The songs are so full and complex that every time I hear them, it's almost like the first time.<br /><br />Just a wonderful, wonderful album!  I love it so much more than Fallen, which only had two or three songs that I enjoyed this much.<br /><br />My personal favorite songs:<br /><br />Snow White Queen<br /><br />Lacrymosa<br /><br />Like You<br /><br />Lithium<br /><br />Weight of the World<br /><br />Sweet Sacrifice<br /><br />Lose Control<br /><br />The Only One<br /><br />All that I'm living for<br /><br />these would get 11 out of 10 stars and the rest get 10 out of 10, this album is that good. There is not one bad song that needs to be skipped over on The Open Door.
B000G09OEC|5.0|Muse are one of the most exciting bands of today. They are definitely an acquired taste, and if you don't like the epic stadium-rock of bands like Queen, you might not really like this record. Also, the keyboards sound very '70's prog-rock-ish. Some of that took a little time for the record to grow on me, but it didn't take long and was more than worth the time. <br /> <br />The record has three Muse classics: \\"Starlight,\\" \\"Map of the Problematique,\\" and \\"Invincible.\\" \\"Starlight,\\" the big hit from the record, is melodic and has a beautiful melody, one of the group's strongest songs. \\"Map of the Problematique\\" almost sounds heavenly, with its futuristic sound and its keybaords. The guitar riffs on this one are interesting, too. \\"Invincible\\" is more top-notch tunefulness from Muse. This one is more straightforward than the other two but hardly less good. <br /> <br />Then the album has its highlights all over. There's the quirky neo-industrial-meets-interesting falsetto vocals of \\"Supermassive Black Hole,\\" the brief and eerie \\"Soldier's Poem\\" has some great lyrics, and great riffs and songs appear throughout. This record is possibly my favorite Muse album yet. All four of 'em are great. And if you haven't gotten this yet, well it's never too late. One of my top five albums of last year.
B00007CVSH|4.0|Jose Cura, simply not in his best vocally here.<br />In the 'bonus CD', Hvorostovsky and Cura commented on their portrayals in this production: they carried out real sword fights in Act I, as opposed to Pavarotti and Milnes' sham sword showing in the other set I've got. However, this highly dramatic scene has its cost - Cura was not attuned to this physical assertion. Dmitri actually gave an account of this scene in the commentary part - he gave credit to Cura, being a tenor, for making this scene dramatically effective. Judging from the performance, however, the credit actually goes to Dmitri, whose singing and acting (in duel) go on simultaneously in a high level without any sign of strain either way. A really great singing-actor. His di Luna is so adorable that really saved the production.<br />Cura's great duet with Yvonne Naef was also strained. Excuse me for comparing his Manrico with Pavarotti's. Naef isn't bad, but the other has got the great Zajick...

B00005ONMJ|5.0|Furtwaengler, Siepi, Della Casa, Otto Edelmann...<br /><br />they belong to a generation now almost gone.<br /><br />So what? If an artistic piece is good, it will be good forever.<br /><br />I don't think this is a moral play.  Cesare Siepi's Don G is never a laughing stock to be mocked at, howsoever he 'disappeared' from stage at the conclusion of the opera.<br /><br />Siepi's Don is suave, lovable, flirtatious, unruly, at times unscrupulous. some thing of a complex mixture that not many singer/actors are capable in producing: Bryn Terfel, to take a recent example.<br /><br />Vocally very suave, singing the most magnetic 'Deh vieni all finestra' imaginable, he is nonetheless very deceptive and cunning in his other aria where he lures Masetto to a remote place and beats him up furiously for thwarting his plans on Zerlina and his new target (Elvira's maid).<br /><br />And the direction is so detailed and convincing - Elvira being veiled so as not to recognise Don G at dawn; Zerlina being a 'little one' in statute as well as in age as so explicity mentioned in the recitative and caricatured in the catalogue aria of Leporello; Ottavio singing in front of Elvira requesting her to sooth Anna after Anna has left the scene, evoking in Elvira a flood of emotions......even Leporello's eating of the 'chicken wing' and being made fun of by his master are all but a few details so often sadly missed in newer productions.<br /><br />And of course, apart from Siepi, we have a very outstanding Lisa della Casa as Donna Elvira, Elisabeth Gruemmer as Donna Anna, and Anton Dermota as Don Ottavio. Not to mention the immaculate Otto Edelmann's Leporello.<br /><br />Walter Berry is also very convincing as the simple peasant Masetto.

B00000K31V|5.0|Your perception may be altered by this science fiction harbinger of things to come by David Cronenberg.. Continuing in the same vein of films like 'Videodrome' and 'Scanners' Cronenberg examines the effects of scientific progress and the fate of mankind.. It is so often the goal of game technicians, movie makers, and perhaps even the distributors of mind altering substances to create an alternate universe.. the nightmare of such endeavors is that it will lead to absolute confusion.. seperation from self.. it is something appealing yet terrifying.. to lose touch with reality.. this is what makes eXistenZ such an engaging thriller - one of the most thought provoking movies you will ever see.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|The storyline is simple and great. There is never a dull moment is this movie. The director did a great job in casting Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock as screen couple.

B00005V9HH|5.0|\\"The Usual Suspects\\" belongs in a league with films like \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Out of Sight.\\" Not just because all three films juggle with time, but because they're all smartly written, well acted crime capers that are usually overlooked as being \\"great films\\" (with the exception of \\"Pulp Fiction\\"). \\"The Usual Suspects\\" blends everything that makes a good crime film. It's well written, has some twists, is well acted, funny, and is rough around the edges. The Usual Suspects are McNamus (Stephen Baldwin), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey); The five men are brought together when they're called in for a lineup, after a truck is hijacked. Pretty soon, the men are plotting jobs together. This all takes place in a flashback, because the film begins with the death of Keaton. Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), a cop, wants to get to the bottom of what happened and wants to know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Keaton is dead. To find out this information, he interviews Verbal Kint, a gimp, who has nothing to lose in revealing information sense he has just been granted immunity by the D.A.'s office. This all leads to the brilliant climax that reveals what exactly a dying Hungarian man meant by the name \\"Keyser Soze.\\" Spacey won his first Oscar for his role as Verbal Kint and he deserved it. For a man who never fails to turn in a winning performance, this is one of his best. The film also won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The film is directed by Bryan Singer, better known as the director of the first two \\"X-Men\\" movies and \\"Superman Returns.\\" He's a director that doesn't get a lot of respect from critics or audiences (usually because he's dealing with beloved comic book characters), but with this film he proves that he is a talented director. The movie's fast-paced and very entertaining and when I said it was funny, I don't mean \\"ha-ha\\" funny...I mean very funny. The lineup scene is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. All the performances are good; Baldwin and Del Toro steal the show with their performances though. If you liked any of the movies I mentioned above or just enjoy smart crime films; you should check this film out.  <br /> <br />GRADE: A-

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|For years \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was considered the best American film ever made. Now, according to the American Film Institute, it's #21. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by John Steinbeck, the movie is directed by John Ford and stars Henry Fonda giving one of the best performances in the history of cinema. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is, in many ways, still the greatest American film in the sense that the film is about America, at a certain time and captures the feeling of The Great Depression better than most any other movie. Fonda plays Tom Joad, one of the most legendary characters of all time. After serving four years in prison for manslaughter, Tom is paroled and returns home to Oklahoma to see his family. On the way home, Tom encounters a former preacher named Casy (John Carradine) and the two travel to Tom's family's farm together. When they get there, they find out that Joad's family has been \\"tractored off the land.\\" When Tom finds his family, they are packing up to head to California. Turns out there are some jobs for picking fruit, 800 people needed. So the Joad family sets off on the peril-laden trip to California, where they find that California might not be much better than what they left behind. Obviously, in my synopsis I've left many characters out including Ma Joad (Jane Darwell, who deservedly won an Oscar) but I figure if you're reading this then you've likely seen the movie anyway. One of the key elements of the films' success is the cinematography, by the legendary Gregg Toland (cinematographer on \\"Citizen Kane\\"). The film is in black & white, which has aged a lot better than color would have and features a lot of night scenes. In many scenes, characters are illuminated by a mere candle. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" has astonishingly not dated over the years; it's still as fresh and entertaining as I imagine it was upon its release. The film has legendary dialogue (the \\"I'll be there\\" speech) and a number of other things that make it so great. Saying a movie is a masterpiece is one thing, but getting people to see it is another. With people flocking to garbage like \\"The Grudge 2\\" and \\"Stomp the Yard\\" how many people actually see \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" anymore? Not many, from my perspective. This is a terrific film that should be seen by any lover of film. <br /> <br />GRADE: A

1932907009|5.0|Save The Cat! is such a prolific, yet simplistic look at the world of story development and screen-crafting that will leave the reader with a depth of knowledge that places them in the same league as many professionals...and above some of them in the world of story development! :)  <br /> <br />I also recommend the software in conjunction with the book!
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|I am a huge fan of the book, but this movie is only mildly entertaining in comparison. It is good for what the director was aiming for-to adapt it to movie screenplay as a thriller. However, the movie leaves out almost all of the crucial character background stories and key character details, as well as many deep themes. This movie turned a groundbreaking piece of literature into a gorefest, but if you watch it just to enjoy it, without obsessing over accuracy, it is still, in itself, a good movie.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The problem I have with teasing taglines like, \\"nothing is what it seems\\" is that it automatically raises my antennae.  It makes me more of an active viewer and I look for the subtle clues buried within the story.  So for me, the ending wasn't surprising. The only things that remained a mystery were the illusionist's uncanny abilities and why he never ate when offered food.  At one point, I thought Eisenheim might have been an illusion himself, or possibly dead (ala Sixth Sense). I loved Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell, and the always superb Edward Norton.  Jessica Beal was beautiful but disappointing.  I realize she is a duchess and has to appear aloof, but not while she is in the arms of the love of her life. There seemed to be very little heat emanating from her, which is a mystery in itself since Edward Norton was so intense.  Otherwise, a great movie and very entertaining.
B00005QAPK|3.0|I have to agree with most people who feel the Fellini Toby Dammit sequence is the only reason to watch it. Vadim sets his in a medieval France populated by people dressed in left over costumes from Barbarella, which sounds like more fun than it is, the case with most Vadim films. Malle's section is simply dull, an utterly uninspiring, and rather unpleasant, version of a good horror tale. The Fellini sequence is easily the best, and also a wonderful take on Poe's story. Stamp is great as a dissolute actor on the bottom. The scenes in the airport as he arrives is some of the best stuff Fellini ever shot. These short story, omnibus film compilations were popular in Europe, and all suffered from the same flaw: the quality of the episodes was never consistent. The late attempt to do one here, NY Stories, suffered the same disability: Passable Scorsese, unwatchable Coppola (scripted by Sofia, as a child, and as talentless then as she is now), and a funny Woody Allen, put at the end, because they knew no one would watch the intolerable Coppola sequence otherwise. The Fellini is also at the end of this film, and a smiliar mindset is at work.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|The casting in this production simply isn't true to the characters; both Jane and Rochester are far too good-looking, while St. John isn't good-looking enough. Rochester isn't as stormy and haunted as he should be, and his mad wife it too attractive to provide the stunning visual contrast between herself and Jane described in the book. Blanche, who was \\"dark as a Spaniard\\" in the book, is a cherubic blonde here, and not nearly as malelovent as described. The story has been tweaked in numerous places; for example, St. John didn't find Jane languishing in the moors, but huddled on the doorstep of the Rivers' house. Because this tale can certainly stand on its own--indeed, it has for nearly 200 years--I wonder at the motivation of those who would change it. I wouldn't watch this a second time. It was entertaining up to a point, but as a huge fan of the book, I was ultimately disappointed. I think it was sadly miscast.

B00005JGAB|5.0|Review no. 127. Essential 1976 body slammin' proto-punk debut record from Joey and crew. Blistering cuts that'll having you literally playing this CD over until you wear it out (possibly)are \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\", \\"Judy Is A Punk\\", the in-your-face \\"I Don't Wanna Go Down To The Basement\\", the total *ss-kicking \\"Havana Affair\\" and \\"Let's Dance\\". Plus, you get six added bonus tracks of demos of the band's repertoire. One thing I'll give The Ramones is they DIDN'T just stay together for two or three lp's LIKE so many other punk bands did, like the Stooges, New York Dolls, Dead Boys, MC 5, etc. They remained intact for twenty years, plus they were active all if not most of that time. Too bad three out of four of them are no longer with us. Highly recommended.

1400082773|5.0|We are all hearing a lot about Obama and this book. It was quickly cited by the media for the ways in which it might hurt his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president. What you may not have heard is the many ways in which it may help him. Obama, unaware that he would some day find the timing just right for a presidential bid, lays out his background in an intelligent and many times emotional way. Is he the stuff of legends? That's not yet clear. What is clear is that anyone who wants to know the real Obama will want to read this book and not rely on the press and pundits to interpret it, or the man, for them.
B00005JOCU|5.0|How could you people criticize Jennifer Hudson's beautiful God given talent? That is not you singing that hard song! Do you realize how hard it is to sing that song? Jennifer Hudson topped the original if you ask me. Usually when songs are remade they lose their power, and the story and the message is destroyed. Jennifer's performance make you feel what not only Effie went through, but we feel what Florence Ballard truly went through. This movie is another black classic right up there with The Five Heart Beats, Cooley High, Coming To America and Sparkle. I'm sorry but most black people can appreciate something like this if those movies I stated early were apart of their childhood. I think this song, \\"And I Am Telling You\\" (I'm Not Going), should be retired because I don't see anyone surpassing the bar that Jennifer has set. She raised that bar with flying colors.<br /><br />I believe the cast altogether were great! You needed everyone in this movie to make the story come alive. Jamie Foxx is sooo good at being bad. He made you hate his character which is what he was suppose to do, job well done. I would have liked to hear his stronger singing voice as well, but truth be told there is no point for it. That would have taken away from the story but I guess they could have slid it in so we could know how he truly felt about Effie and why he betrayed her, at the point when Deena left him. But the movie was ending anyway that would have been more time. Good call. Eddie Murphy was excellent! He brought back Sexual Chocolate from Coming To America. I cracked up, because he played his role to the T! I would have liked to see more James Brown moves since the character was loosely based on him.<br /><br />This movie is a Comedy/Musical. Not just drama, and I feel that you negative reviewers are rating this as such. You are taking this WAY too seriously. It doesn't matter about Beyonce's character, we are suppose to focus on EFFIE! If the creator wanted us to focus on Deena, she would have more lines with something to really make us connect with her. By giving her too much to say will take the focus off of what Effie/Florence Ballard went through. We know that Diana made it, what else is there to know?<br /><br />Diana Ross and Berry Gordy really gave Florence a raw deal and the movie forgot to mention that Florence died while still on welfare. I'm sure the ending of them reuniting is to only save face for Diana Ross and try not to leave us with a bad impression of her. She slept with Berry Gordy, had his baby and got all the attention and fame and poor Florence was kicked to backup and then out of the group. Jennifer Hudson's performance opens up such a connection that you really want to do your research about the Supremes and find out the truth. Do your research and then watch the movie.na, she would have more lines with something to really make us connect with her.

0743270754|5.0|As an enthusiastic consumer of presidential biographies I can without hesitation say this is the best I've read. Goodwin presents Lincoln in all his glory and vulnerability. The Civil War is followed without the usual complexities of the battleground, yet without detriment to the sacrifices made there. One comes to accept how very crucial it was that a man of Lincoln's caliber came on the scene when he did. The parallels between those days and today are unmistakable. The death of this great man, as told by the author, seems as stunning and heartbreaking in the reading as it must have been that fateful day. One wants to shake Goodwin's hand, or at the very least write a review filled with these sincere sentiments.
B000KQGP2G|3.0|Ok well I was hoping for the Perfect ElementII but Daniel states in a European Article that this album is not TPE II. ANyway, people are wondering about the concept and from what I have heard it is Daniel complaining about the problems he finds within  America and our way of life. Anyone who is a POS fan knows about Daniel and his not wanting to come to America becuase fingerprinting is a violation of his rights. Well I guess he made the album he has always wanted to make and I guess it's easier to blame others rather than look in a mirror ( we all live on this planet, therefore we are all in this together). On a side note this album is better than BE ( which was a good concept, but the music just wasn't there) and more musical. It's a good record but far from one of their best. There are highlights musically on this record and I think POS is heading back around to what they do best musically. But I can't help but think that Daniel put his personal views above his composition talents.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Give this album a chance to sink into your heart. Don't just listen to it - read the lyrics along with the songs. Each is a colorful slice of life and love; of conflict and the quest for resolution - in the small and grand scheme. These are deeply moving songs that demand all your senses to be thoroughly appreciated. Drink them down slowly as you would a fine wine - you won't be disappointed.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|I had been looking for this movie everywhere and finally remembered that I probably could find it on Amazon and I did. The movie is great and I especially love the video  \\"I will always love you.\\" by Whitney Houston. I also enjoyed the behind the scene interviews.

B000KQGX1Y|5.0|For those who are unfamiliar with Celtic Woman, it was a group that reached the spotlight with the help of PBS, which aired it several years ago as part of its artists exposure programs and was quickly overwhelmed by viewer feedback that created a world tour and generated enough buzz to bring them farther along.  At the moment, their eponymous debut and a Christmas album share the top two spots on the Billboard World Music charts.  Their debut also hit platinum last month. <br /> <br />With the launch of new CDs after a long span of extraordinary success, listeners are always slightly nervous about what will be released.  The first tastes of A New Journey were in PBS's airing of the August concerts in Slane Castle last December, and for those who saw it and loved it as I did, the CD is not much else than most of the Slane program studio-recorded and mixed/edited/etc.  As someone who watched the PBS showing probably too much, there wasn't anything surprising or new on the CD (the only songs that were not in the PBS special are The Blessing and Vivaldi's Rain, the latter of which was released on one of the CW solo albums). <br /> <br />That doesn't mean anything to those who missed Slane or just want to have the songs on CD.  The music is a blend of genres, a sound quite unique to Celtic Woman.  There are relatively few numbers that actually befit their name, such as Dulaman and Newgrange.  The CW sound is more of a new-age-meets-classical-with-modern-Celtic-splash.  A fair number of the tracks are original compositions by David Downes (and several others such as Brendan Graham and the fiddler Mairead Nesbitt to name a few).  What makes CW so successful in the US is the use of songs that the American audience is familiar with, such as Beyond the Sea, Scarborough Fair, and Over the Rainbow and adding Celtic touches, like fiddling breaks and Uillean Pipes.  And I like the sound.  This album throws a lot more rearranged contemporary at you and even tries a few new things. <br /> <br />The group introduces a more classical element to the mix than in the first album with the addition of world-famous New Zealander Hayley Westenra.  While Meav, Orla, and Lisa tend towards more Celtic-themed music, the younger members Chloe and Hayley tend towards classical numbers (Lascia Ch'io Pianga and Vivaldi's Rain).  While this is not necessarily a bad thing, because Hayley has been one of my favorite singers since the release of \\"Pure,\\" it does move the group even farther away from the Celtic roots it tries to hold onto.  I'm neutral about that, since some of the numbers are great additions, but just a word of warning. <br /> <br />The album opens with a strong number, The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun, a Downes composition with lyrics told from the interesting perspective of the celestial bodies above.  It moves quickly into the Prayer, a Chloe solo that many will know from Celine Dion's duet rendition.  The song shows quite well how her voice has matured since Walking in the Air several years ago.  She is still only 17 or 18 and has a ways to go, but I like her more than I did in the original.  Newgrange is more mysterious, throwing a Celtic curveball that challenges the listener to think about the ancient history of the Celtic lands.  Over the Rainbow is going to be a number that you either love or hate.  It's a 4-part acapella arrangement that is quite beautiful, but some might just be sick of the song. <br /> <br />Granuaile's Dance introduces one of the purely instrumental pieces, an original composition by Downes and the performer Mairead.  Those with the DVD are in for a treat, as her playstyle is unique and a joy to watch.  The Blessing is a more religious number with Celtic touches, a Lisa solo not that serves a similar role as Send Me a Song did in the debut.  Dulaman is the most Celtic, a barrage of Irish Gaelic sung by the superb Meav (my favorite of the 5).  Look up the lyrics if you can and the cultural context of Dulaman (\\"seaweed\\") and you're in for something interesting.  Beyond the Sea is one of my favorites and a perfect example of contemporary meets Celtic.  Downes' arrangement is wonderful and something different from Sinatra.  The beautiful Irish air the Last Rose of Summer gets wonderful treatment in a duet between Hayley and Meav and Caledonia is a very beautiful Scottish ballad.  Carrickfergus (in which Orla plays the harp live in the show) is a great number and follows a man from life to death in a sad and beautiful song. <br /> <br />Lascia Ch'io Pianga and Vivaldi's Rain are the more classical numbers as I mentioned.  I don't particularly like either song, mostly because of their positioning between strong Celtic numbers that break the mood a bit.  Vivaldi's Rain is set to the 2nd movement of Vivaldi's Winter, a popular musical theme that many artists have put lyrics to (including Hayley in \\"River of Dreams\\").  The Voice, the Eurovision Song Contest Winner of 1996 is a song almost perfect for Lisa's voice (better than for Eimear Quinn, though she is very good).  Scarborough Fair gives a Celtic touch to Simon and Garfunkel and Hayley delivers it beautifully in her highlight on the album.  Mo Ghile Mear is a high-energy ending to the album (though on tour, I believe it still ends with You Raise Me Up), a great original composition with strong instrumental and vocal parts that are separate, then integrated.   <br /> <br />Those with the deluxe edition receive four more songs.  The first, Sing Out, is probably my least favorite song that CW has ever recorded.  It just... doesn't work.  It's a good news Christian song that you might hear in a modernized church assembly or from a Christian band, but it's not something I like to hear in a Celtic CD, even though it is an original composition with a quirky Celtic touch to it.  Shenandoah/Pacific Slope is something I wish was part of the non-deluxe edition.  It is another fiddler-only piece and I don't think that Mairead is given justicewhen every other artist receives two solos on the normal soundtrack while she only receives one.  It is a nice piece that mixes traditional with original and the fact that it was recorded live makes it special for me like the Ashoken Farewell/Contradiction did on the original.  At the Ceili is an original number that is very entertaining and is one of the highlights (in my opinion, it makes the deluxe album worth buying) of both the album and the show (choreographed and such).  It tells of women attending the Ceili, a traditional Irish communal gathering-dance where many relations strike it up, as the women are hoping to do.  Spanish Lady is a short but sweet number that uses the chamber choir well. <br /> <br />In all, I feel that this album is a bit of a different direction for CW, but it's to be expected unless the listener is illiterate and cannot read the title of the album.  It is something that both fans and new listeners should not miss, as the new direction is very accessible for the US.  The new age sound is relaxing and the music is great for winding down at night.  The group numbers, the CW highlights, are, for the most part, done well and are an enjoyable blend of five unique voices.  Listeners should expect much more from CW in the future, since the possibilities for new pieces are limitless and the successes just continue to build.   <br /> <br />Expect much from this album and more in the future. <br />
B000KGGLCU|5.0|The Confessions Tour is by far and away the best show Madonna has put on.  It's amazing that she could've put together such a dynamic show in so short a time.  The set list is top-notch, with emphasis on the Confessions on a Dance Floor album but still performing some big hits.  \\"Like A Virgin\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\" were very nice surprises on there, and they meld into the theme and mood of the show seamlessly.  The visuals Madonna gives us are unmatched.  The stage itself is so huge and complex that there's always something to look at.  Jonas Akerlund's direction gives makes this DVD the closest experience to actually being there! <br /> <br />The most standout performance on there is \\"Live To Tell\\".  From the haunting start of the song where the giant cross is rising up with Madonna on it, to the song's flame-engulfed finale, it's certainly a defining Madonna moment!  The Disco Queen ending of \\"Lucky Star/Hung Up\\" is also a spectacle! <br /> <br />The DVD sound (DTS or stereo) is flawless and encompassing.  The widescreen presentation of the video gives it a bigger feel.  The video quality is lacking a little bit, as I experienced heavy pixelation during \\"Isaac\\", \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Let It Will Be\\", but it's forgivable.  The audio CD is crystal clear and has some of the best performances from the show, especially the super rare \\"Erotica/You Thrill Me\\"!  If you buy on iTunes, you also get audio versions of \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\".  I do wish that \\"Drowned World\\" would be on there too, but again, forgivable. <br /> <br />All in all, a great release from Madonna!  5 Stars!

B000KGGLCU|5.0|OK, Madonna is in one corner... ALL THE REST OF THEM are in another...    I mean, c'mon let's face it!    She proved that with Reinvention Tour and then again with Confessions. I was fortunate enough to attend both tours, and although I did enjoy The Reinvention Tour more, the Confessions Tour was apparently made for dvd! I don't know WHAT I watched at Thanksgiving, but seeing this dvd was a seriously different experience. It is AMAZING!    It is so intuitively edited, obviously the flow is preserved since it's commercial-free, the fantastic in-your-face Sorry remix video can be seen, the misunderstood Live To Tell crucifixion is staggeringly beautiful and Lucky Star is back in, all of which make for a much, MUCH better experience.    Also, the editing and the bleeding through of the background video imagery (especially in Get Together and Music Inferno) will drop your friends' jaws after they all beg to borrow this one.    So, yeah, Madonna is in a class by herself and this concert seals the already made deal... And when you're high above the crowd, in the brightest spotlight, on a pedestal, clearly Number One, you're gonna attract the \\"haters\\". Please. What a compliment, really, the \\"hate\\" she gets...    \\"Cause I'm never gonna stop, no, no...\\" ~ Madonna
B000IONJH4|3.0|First I'd like to say that \\"Dune\\" never looked this good on any home video medium before. Even if you saw this as a film print theatrically now it probably wouldn't match this presentation. <br /> <br />The amount of image detail in some scenes is truly amazing. Sadly, the quality of the source material is quite inconsistent. Some scenes are very grainy and offer poor contrast. Some dirt could have been cleaned up as well. <br /> <br />Compared to other \\"reference\\" titles such as \\"King Kong\\" I 'd call this transfer \\"above average\\" (3/5)
0440237688|5.0|When I read this book a quite number of years ago, and I remember being somewhat confused and a little overwhelmed by the message it sent. Well, I always was a fairly advanced reader, so I was probably in Elementary School when I tackled this one, which was probably a little young to successfully grasp the whole meaning. From reading the kids' reviews for this book, it seems to me that others are having the same trouble. While this is indeed meant for kids, it has some adult-level ideas in it that may be difficult for some children to understand in their entirety (although in all fairness, I'm not sure I truly understood the true importance of The Giver and the Keeper of Memories until I became a History Major). <br /> <br />Overall, though, I would recommend this book to anyone, Adults and children alike (though I would probably aim it at 6th/7th grade and up to ensure comprehension). Do not miss this book. It is a quick read, but worth the time and effort.
0446605409|3.0|Take Michael Connelly's Detective Harry Bosch, a hard-boiled, talented, nearly burnt-out loner with lots of psychological baggage and absolutely no respect for superiors or procedure. Add the self-deprecating faux stumble-bum approach of Peter Falk's Columbo and toss in a heaping helping of smart-aleck motor mouth Rodney Dangerfield complete inability to control the flow of virulent sarcasm and wisecracks! Sounds a little much, doesn't it? But he's our hero for Nelson DeMille's \\"Plum Island\\".<br /><br />John Corey, NYPD homicide detective, is on medical leave recovering from bullet wounds when his friend, chief of the Southold Police Department, enlists his aid looking into the double homicide of Tom and Judy Gordon, also friends of Corey, and employees of Plum Island, the nearby high-level bio-containment facility studying deadly animal diseases such as anthrax and simian Ebola. First terrifying appearances were that some sort of biological terrorist threat had gone sour but the old rule of \\"follow the money\\" lead to a somewhat more tolerable line of investigation. It seemed the Gordons had stolen a vaccine with the motive of peddling it to the pharmaceutical world for billions.<br /><br />But Corey's in-your-face persistence was uncovering clues and details that just didn't seem to mesh with that story. Simple drug-running was a possibility but even that didn't quite click. Eventually, Corey uncovers an amazingly entertaining story of greed, money, murder, mayhem and political skullduggery spanning three hundred years of history and ranging geographically from New York, to the Caribbean, to England and back again.<br /><br />In a style that reminded me of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's incurable penchant for technical sidebars, DeMille has tossed off a bewildering variety of essays that entertained, informed and, at the same time, moved the story forward. The staged lecture tour of Plum Island's hazardous facility, hosted first by Security Chief Paul Stevens and followed by the facility's director Dr Zollner was worth the reading of the book all by itself. But you'll also be treated to snippets of detail on coastal marine navigation, a cornucopia of procedural information on the necessary foundation police work to solving a homicide and (are you ready for this?) a rather extensive history of Captain Kidd and his 17th century privateering exploits that ultimately ended in his execution in England!<br /><br />Lots of promise to be sure and there's certainly no doubt about DeMille's skill as a writer! But, just as a little bit of someone like John Corey would go a long, long way in real life, his constant cracking wise left me cold on the printed page as well! If DeMille had seen his way to lopping 100 pages off the final draft, it would have been just right and I would have ended the story not only entertained by the police procedural but laughing at Corey's antics in the bargain. Just three stars but recommended as a quick and entertaining piece of brain candy anyway! Enjoy!<br /><br />Paul Weisstevens and followed by the facility's director Dr Zollner was worth the reading of the book all by itself.

B0007TKNII|5.0|The \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is a wonderful movie. Even if you think you wouldn't like opera this movie will change your opinion ! In a word it is an AWESOME viewing experience ! We recently saw the live opera at a theater in Philadelphia and it was truly outstanding but I have to say the movie can do more elaborate scenes because of certain special effects so it is even more of an enjoyable experience....... I recommend anyone of any age watching and/or buying this movie , it is quite memorable !!!

015603283X|5.0|While many of the literary references were over my head, it was amazingly easy to follow the paper trail (pun intended). We have two trails: a document that appears to be part of The Three Musketeers, and a `demon book', \\"The Book of the Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows\\". The two don't seem to have much in common, but as Corso (a \\"book detective\\") continues his investigation of both the document and the book, disturbing similarities begin to appear. <br /> <br />What should be a simple case of authentication becomes a race against time, and a desperate attempt to stay alive. A girl with dubious intentions and origins joins Corso after many chance meetings, and her presence thickens the stew. Who is she? What is she? Why does she care about Corso? <br /> <br />The questions pile up, and answers aren't in abundance. Friends seem, at times, to be enemies, and enemies seem to be friendly. Corso's actions, as well as others around him, seem to mirror events from The Three Musketeers, and the characters seem to be playing their parts - Milady, Roquefort, and Richelieu. Everything seems tied in together, but how? The Three Musketeers and a \\"demon book\\"? <br /> <br />Three copies of the \\"Book of the Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows\\" exist, and Corso's charge is to find them all, compare them, and verify their authenticity - though his employer tells him that the copy he gives Corso is most certainly a forgery, although he will not tell Corso how he knows that. The content of the book is fascinating, and Corso's investigation into comparing the texts and the meaning behind everything within opens deadly doors - doors, perhaps, to Hell. Doors that could bring Satan himself into the material world. There is also reference to the \\"Delomelanicon\\", a book purportedly written by Lucifer himself, apparently a precursor, of sorts, to the \\"Book of the Nine Doors...\\" <br /> <br />The narrative structure of the story is ingenious. It starts in first person, and then switches toa seemingly odd third person telling. At first, you will wonder why the author chose that particular structure, but as with everything else, that question will be satisfactorily answered. <br /> <br />Some say this is Umberto Eco `light'. Probably. I have a difficult time getting through fiction that Eco has written since \\"The Name of the Rose\\". You could also call this Dan Brown for Intellectuals. Whichever. They're both compliments. <br />
B000I5X80G|2.0|It has been known for years - decades even! - that Neil Young recorded all his live performances. It was also generally accepted for years that this was Mr. Young's way of providing quality assurance/control and of being the obsessive that he is.<br /><br />Then, sometime in the last century - OK the 1990s - word began to spread that he would begin the release of a multi-volume series of these performances under the somewhat eponymous title \\"Archives.\\" In fact, if I am not wrong, the fan-base in general and Reprise Record in particular believed that this would occur in 1999 or 2000.<br /><br />Instead, Rock Rocks Volume 1 was released.<br /><br />The 2006/2007 holiday season saw Live at the Fillmore East ~ Neil Young and Crazy Horse released. This six song EP - because that is what this is, it is by no means an LP by anyone's stretch of imagination - gives us maybe one third or half of the show on any one of the two nights at the Fillmore East or on the entire tour for that matter. To that end, see CGT's review below for what the set list might have been like.<br /><br />What does the buyer get for his/her money: six songs and a DVD. The songs are an interesting mix of classic tour cuts and a surprise of sorts. The EP leads off with `Everybody Knows This is Nowhere,' a version that is true to its country-bumpin' roots but is - to this reviewer's mind - rather pedestrian. Up next is `Winterlong,' and a long, cold, slow season it is as Neil and Crazy Horse (Whitten, Molina, Talbot and Nitzsche) seem so down that they cannot be bothered to do anything but slog through the song as if they're imitating Vanilla Fudge.<br /><br />`Down by the River' is the first song to show real fire with Young's lead guitar slashing ahead and the band staying close behind with solid accompaniment and choruses.<br /><br />Then, for me, came the shock as `Wonderin'' was performed by something other than Neil Young and the Shocking Pinks. I have followed Young for years and am well aware that his song release chronology is far from that of his writing. Still this song was a surprise - and a fine rendition it is - was a bit of a peak on the EP.<br /><br />\\"Come on Baby, Let's Go Downtown' was excellent but has to be considered like meeting up with a friend. The experience is pleasant but shallow.<br /><br />The record closes with a fiery version of `Cowgirl in the Sand' that is spectacular to experience initially, but, as the song ends, you really wish you had been there because it is so painfully obvious that you are missing most of the performance.of his writing.

Each night we read this book to our son as we are completing our bedtime routine.  How appropriate that the animals in this book are doing just that, completing their bedtime routine.  The animals see that the sun has set, so they take a bath, find pajamas, brush their teeth, exercise, turn off their light, and rock to sleep.  Each page shows Sandra Boynton's famous silly animals.  The wording consists of fun rhymes and the last page, \\"The moon is high, the sea is deep.  We rock, and rock, and rock to sleep,\\" is perfect for snuggling up in a rocker and getting ready to drift off to sleep.
B0000640VO|5.0|I think Audrey Tautou is an amazing actress and her abilities transcend language barriers.  This film is sweet and is so touching that you find yourself losing track of time and believing so much in everything that happens.  Even having to read the translated dialogue tag at the bottom throughout because my French isn't the best, the whole thing flows so well you forget you're reading along.  I highly recommend not only this film but also anything Audrey Tautou does - she is simply charming.  This is definitely one to own and have in your library.  Plus that, any film that can integrate a garden gnome into the plotline should get two thumbs up!!
B000ENC6XM|5.0|Ok so who cannot love this movie!??  Well a few, but we loved it and that may have to do with the fact that we love Keanu Reeves.  The HD DVD disc is really cool and the menus are sweet as well.  Like another reviewer mentioned there wasn't any sex scenes.  Surprised at first but though maybe it was time that every movie doesn't have gratuitous sex scenes.  If you watch the extras you will see alternate endings which were cool.  You also get to see a scene where their was supposed sex with the girl with the tail.  You won't know she has a tail LOL until you see that deleted scene.<br /><br />Downside is that the extra scenes are in bad quality, seem that they came straight from the reel.  Again, loved the plot and would love to see him reprise the role.  Gotta love Gabriel and the Devil!
B000B6CO52|5.0|In 1989 Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID initiated a significant renaissance of family films of both the animated and live action variety. There were actually quite a few live action family films produced up through the mid 90s that combined outrageous situations, sentimental plotting and good doses of visual mayhem to entertain most audiences. Some of these films such as HOME ALONE (1990), BEETHOVEN (1992), HOMEWARD BOUND: THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY (1993) and DENNIS THE MENACE (1993) were the staples of this renaissance. By the mid 90s the appeal of such films seemed to be waning. 1995's JUMANJI seemed to be one of the last of the films to gain recognition and prominence at least to the audiences that went to see it. Many of the noted critics at that time were not exactly enamored with this film.<br /><br />I sat in the theatre thinking that this was one of the most innovative films to come along for some time. It not only contained those elements that characterized the aforementioned family films but also combined convincing (for that time) digital effects, real drama, danger and concluded with an important message that parents and children should take the time to take note of each other. They should not take each other for granted and not create impenetrable boundaries around themselves. Unfortunately as seen in this film, a boy most grow into manhood before he understands that perhaps his father does not know how to approach him.<br /><br />JUMANJI is filled with action and many special effects that really are elements of the catharsis that Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) must endure before he can ever possibly go home again. Watching this film again recently I was touched by the scene where Robin Williams visits the old family shoe business to find the factory empty and closed down. It is now a makeshift home for a transient old man who barely remembers the fate of Williams' dad. That scene counterbalanced with the score that James Horner had composed of the earlier New England setting was bittersweet. Watching that scene I also drifted back to the time when this film was first released. They really don't make films like this any more. Those were the good old days. And it's really not that long ago. For a while the studios were making intelligent films for the whole family that weren't afraid to make you feel for the characters as well as laugh with them.

B0009NSDCK|5.0|Are there parallels with the Allies' recent incursion into Iraq and the subsequent occupation? That was one of the questions I asked myself from a military perspective when I recently watched this film again. The missions seem ill-defined in both cases. The military opposition is overwhelming to the point where conventional weaponry and tactics seem outmoded and ineffective to accomplish what thumbnail sketch of a mission there actually is.<br /><br />It often seems that moments of courage are a result of military expedience characterized simultaneously with a predilection of military ineptness. How a general could ever let his men enter a maze-like city surrounded by thousands of hostile inhabitants is beyond comprehension. Sam Shepard as that general exceeded the scope of his mission and his command putting his men in harm's way in broad daylight. Ridley Scott seems uniquely capable of ferreting out the military decisions that led to this debacle but places no blame. However, all the blame is up there on the screen if you choose to take note similar to the way Sam Shepard watches it on his TV monitor. Scott instead places the viewer into a 180-degree maelstrom of bullets, bombs, shrapnel, blood, sweat and tears. In 160 years of technology it is amazing how some of the images are reminiscent of the last stand at the Alamo. What has been learned in all those years? Every good war film needs a hero and Tom Sizemore gives the best performance as one hardened and dedicated officer. The most interesting shot in this film is where a tired and weary group of Americans finally emerge from the city covered in dirt, gunpowder, blood and grease and they are greeted by foreign United Nations troops wearing turbans. These UN fellows offer the Americans glasses of water served from silver trays with white linen napkins draped over their arms. So much for modern technology it would seem.<br /><br />One thing that is certain is the strength of the cast assembled for director Ridley Scott's film. The cast includes Ewan McGregor, Josh Hartnett, William Fichtner, Eric Bana, Jason Isaacs not to mention Sam Shepard and Tom Sizemore again. They are a strong ensemble of actors making this film very realistic and thought provoking.Ridley Scott's film.

B0009KQOME|4.0|The premise and execution of this film defies credibility but some outrageous character portrayals, performances and neat driving make this film entertaining. I found some car enthusiasts who really like this film and others who find it ludicrous and berate it. After all is said it does not fail to entertain. If you can look past the incredulous premise, this film can also be rather addictive. When all the dust settled Vinnie Jones as The Sphinx really made my day.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|While everyone was debating whether Jay-Z's Kingdom Come would mark the resurrection of Hip-hop, the Gatman & Robin duo of 50 Cent & Eminem released \\"You Don't Know\\" featuring proteges Lloyd Banks and Ca$his to radio and watched it rise up the pop charts. It had been a long time since a non-Dance rap track had climbed so high up in the charts. Probably not since Eminem's \\"When I'm Gone\\" in '05. Such is the power of the man and it got me thinking that if anyone can 'save' hip-hop from hip-hop its Eminem, because he doesn't have to make you dance to make you listen. Maybe other rappers will start to believe that they do not have to make snap music to sell.<br /><br />Em and Alchemist play it clever by including 4 remixes and a couple of single verse tracks to give the tape a real mixtape feel and as far as original beats are concerned Eminem continues to improve. He maintains the style he has become famous for but he experiments more with the instruments (even including some beat boxing on the title track) to great effect. Alchemist & Dr. Dre contribute a couple of gems and the rest is from some kids I never heard off but I'll definitely keep an eye on.<br /><br />The biggest question for most fans is whether after doing it all musically and having a private life that rivals any soap opera (marriage, divorce, drugs, retirement, deaths etc.) does he (Eminem) still have it. Unfortunately we'll have to wait for an album before we can fully answer that question but this mixtape gives us hope that he can remain relevant. The full spectrum of the MC's skills are on display on here albeit in quick fixes, Slim Shady with the humour, Marshall Mathers showing off his serious side.<br /><br />Eminem is not the only one who revives hope as the surprise (arguably best) performance is from Mr Curtis 'Interscope' Jackson a.k.a 50 Cent himself who raps with a renewed vigour on tracks with Eminem. Gone are the sing song choruses, or the soft verses to the ladies and in with the Gangsta, hustler we all fell in love with (albeit a bit more grown & comfortable i.e. less hungry). The disses are still there but they are more tastefully done (\\" I carried Game's style for 9 months and gave birth to it/ Now I feel like a proud father watching him do it\\"). His 4 appearances including a nice remix of his Disco D (R.I.P) classic \\"Ski Mask Way\\" are definite highlights of the tape.<br /><br />As far as proteges go Obie Trice rubber stamps his position as the most gifted outside of Em, Dre & 50 by continuing where he left off on Second Rounds On Me. These days it seems MC's have forgotten all about the flow in favour of hard-core or conscious lyrics but Obie takes it back to when it was all about the flow.<br /><br />Yeah, Trice is back on the Alche' track<br /><br />With Ca$his, capitalizing on this mic in fact<br /><br />We f%$@in with the captain of rap<br /><br />My ni%%a with the Nike cap keep the continuity quite exact<br /><br />So I lure you cats into the second classic<br /><br />We're mature as the numero uno aspect, as yet<br /><br />Who's to pass the driver?<br /><br />O tries to flow to die fo' and the death blow survive (woo!)<br /><br />I echo through your external vibe<br /><br />with internal experiences I've acquired (uhh)<br /><br />I'm probably the most honest hip-hopper alive<br /><br />A victim depicting images from my own eyes (yeah!)<br /><br />...<br /><br />It's Ca$his, O. Tri', rappers we blow by<br /><br />This is as accurate as the masses will have it, no lie<br /><br />Ni%%a!<br /><br />If I have to criticise Obie though I would have to bring up the fact that his swagger (or ego) is not as big as his talent and as a result when he speaks of revenge on the remix to \\"Pistol, Pistol\\" he is not quite convincing.<br /><br />Ca$his is the most prominent MC on the tape after Em with two solo joints and while he is talented he doesn't have a style or voice that really set him apart and as a result he is at his best when the beat is alsotight e.g. \\"Cry Now (Remix)\\" Bobby Creekwater is the more compelling of the two newbies with hard lyrics and a southern drawl that seems to be a requisite for a successful rapper these days. He has a style that makes him easy to listen to and more importantly easy to believe. Stat Quo on the other hand is a bit of a let down, given that he gets to helm one a rare Dr. Dre beat. Lyrically he is all over the place and its not clear if he wants us to take him seriously or whether he wants to play the joker role like Ludacris of old. Finally D-12 also make an appearance which will keep fans happy but won't necessarily win them any new ones, although Proof does kick a hot 16 on \\"Trapped\\"<br /><br />Overall I'd say it is a masterpiece as far as mixtapes go and it is better than most compilations which are usually too all over the place. It acts as a teaser, a warm up record, a declaration of the return of Shady, a return of 'no gimmick hip-hop.' As an album it is slightly flawed but it serves its purposeg of the two newbies with hard lyrics and a southern drawl that seems to be a requisite for a successful rapper these days.

0780622650|3.0|I remember the series Lost in Space as corny and campy, not much different from other 60s fluff that offered no illusions of seriousness.  The movie, on the other hand, had both motive and opportunity to make it respectable.  Given the cast and budget, it certainly failed my expectations.  The story is actually pretty good with a nice twist toward the end and a terrific climax.  The special effects are well done and more than enough to keep things visually appealing all the way through.  Where it suffers is in the dialogue and in the two dimensional characters that never rise above what's necessary.  Most of the cast stepped into this with impressive credentials and I was expecting some pretty dynamic acting because of it.  For whatever reasons, they were limited to contrived, predictable lines that did more damage than any over the top special effects (including the alien weasel thingy they manufactured for kid appeal).  Unfortunately, I think even kids sniffed this one out as a bit of a stinker.  That said, it has its moments and offers enough fun to make the worst of it forgivable.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  I think it was, however, a missed opportunity on a number of levels.  A better showing up front might have laid the foundation for a better sequel.  We'll never know.
B000MXQO1O|5.0|This is a very impressive and well-structured cinematic rework of Batman's origins. The cast is first rate. Christian Bale's performance is impressive adding a dimension of emotion to the stoic side of the character. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score for BATMAN BEGINS is mesmerizing and quite moving. There is a lot of pent up emotion, energy and haunting beauty just waiting to explode. This is not your typical BATMAN score established by Danny Elfman but it maintains an undercurrent of continuous movement and vibrancy and is just overwhelmingly enthralling. It examines a meaningful nature of the character and his motivations augmenting Christian Bale's dedicated performance perfectly. The plot is also very solid. When I think of how the origin of Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) was interwoven into the film, I was impressed. This Batman film succeeds on every level.<br /><br />The comic book was very impressive.
B00000K0DT|4.0|The title might suggest a comedic takeoff on a crime thriller employing some sophisticated shtick or maybe we're in for something like Danny DeVito in \\"Throw Mama from the Train.\\"  But this is not a comedy.  It is not exactly your usual crime thriller either.  It is an unconscious parody of crime thrillers with some curious depth replete with corrupt cops, shadowy off screen sinister villains and pathetic low lifes.<br /><br />Although I don't think director Bryan Singer and his high school pal and collaborator, scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie, had the slightest intention toward burlesque, I was again and again struck by an unconscious underlying tone of parody.  The title is the tip off.<br /><br />\\"Round up the usual suspects\\" is a line from Casablanca (1942), as most movie buffs know.  Claude Rains, as Captain Renault, head of the police in Casablanca, says \\"round up the usual suspects\\" more as an indication of local Moroccan justice than as a real order.  It is just the sort of cynically ironic line that would inspire Singer and McQuarrie to dream up this exceedingly cynical, but bordering on the funny, flick.<br /><br />While Casablanca was a bittersweet love story, \\"The Usual Suspects\\" is anything but.  The cast is decidedly and deliberately all male with only Suzy Amis in a minor role as Edie Finneran to interfere with the macho lineup of crooks, cops and shady sinister types.  The movie features Stephen Baldwin (Mike McManus), Gabriel Bryne (Dean Keaton), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kujan), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), and stars Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint.  These guys are all excellent actors who together create a kind mass energy that propels the film.  In more ways than one I am reminded of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) and David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) (movie directed by James Foley).  Consider these similarities:<br /><br />In both Glengarry and The Usual Suspects you have a virtually all male cast who sling expletives at one another in an \\"at your throat\\" style.  In both Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects you have five crooks thrown together to do a job, and again everything is exceedingly macho with threats and expletives flying around like water in a hurricane.  In all three films the cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Ed Harris, Alex Baldwin, Kevin Spacey and Alan Arkin leading the cast in Glengarry, and Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi doing the same in Reservoir Dogs.  These guys are not your run of the mill actors.  They are the kind of guys that star in kick butt movies.  They know how to look and act authentic.<br /><br />But an even more startling way to compare The Usual Suspects with Glengarry and Reservoir Dogs is in the dialogue.  In all three movies the dialogue is preciously wrought with an emphasis on sounding just a little different.  In Reservoir Dogs Tarantino sometimes makes the characters sound like they are spouting Shakespeare, and in Glengarry Glen Ross Mamet has them playing verbal hijinks like machine gun chatter in an experimental stage play.  Here Singer and McQuarrie (his script won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay) employ a lot of the same rapid fire, seemingly authentic vernacular interspersed with theatrical sounding speech especially in the case of Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) who calmly calls everybody \\"Mister\\" like an English butler.  And of course Verbal is very verbal and able to spout lines like, \\"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist.\\"<br /><br />Keep that line in mind as you watch, and ask yourself who plays Keyser Soze, the devil incarnate, so to speak.  And pay attention to references to Skokie, Illinois.  That will help to unravel the plot.  The ending contains a nicely set up surprise.<br /><br />Currently rated #17 at IMDb, The Usual Suspects is the sort of cult favorite beloved by young males fascinated with testosterone-hyped action, macho-inspired dialogue and devil man care anti-heroics.  But it's a little better than that.  And clearly this is not a chick flick, and therein lies a problem.  While most males will at least find this interesting, many females will just shake their heads at how obvious is the seduction of the targeted audience.  Personally I thought the movie was a laugh.  I actually laughed out loud at some of the theatrics and grinned with appreciation at how surely Singer had captured the mentality of the targeted audience while bonding with it.  But I have to say (for those directors, writers and producers who would like to do half as well), you can't fake it.  Tarantino and Singer and others have been able to pull this sort of thing off because they really believe in the psychology.  They really believe there are tough guys who say \\"f-you\\" even with a gun shoved in their face, and there really are guys who see the world in a kind of cops/robbers, good guy/bad guy, buddy/rat persona world.  And there's some truth to it.<br /><br />Spacey won a supporting actor Oscar playing Verbal Kint, a kind of crippled loser, it would seem. He should have won Best Actor, he was that good and he was the heart of the film and the guy with whom the audience most identified.  He is the seeming loser, the little guy, the underdog who turns out to be smarter and tougher than anybody else.  I think that is what the targeted audience really loves about this movie.<br /><br />Bottom line: a must see for anybody interested in the history of the American cinema and in the evolution of the mystery/thriller/noir genre.  A few academic dissertations have been and will be written on how the cinematic hero has evolved from, say, Tom Mix to Verbal Kint.

B000MQ58VS|4.0|You find hope, passion and a reason for being in the strangest places. I was very touched by this film. It is much deeper and touching than I imagined it would be. Several of the images still remain with me touching me somewhere deep inside and from times long ago. Johnny Depp continues to show signs of brilliance as an actor. You feel his passion as well as his pain in his performance.  He so effortlessly touches all those who believe in his dreams. Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman and ultimately Julie Christie succumb to his belief that dreams can come true.
1843104954|5.0|Dr. Attwood is the leading expert on Asperger's Syndrome (AS) which is the spectrum partner to autism.  This book is, at the time of this review his most current work.  It is a shining gem and one of the standouts in autism/Asperger's (a/A) literature.  If you are on the a/A continuum or know somebody who is, this book is your best friend.  You will refer to it many times.<br /><br />What makes this book all the more excellent and distinct is that Dr. Attwood discusses adults on the a/A spectrum as well.  Autism in its myriad forms including AS does not clear up once a person hits adulthood.  If you have it, it is with you for the long haul.  Dr. Attwood's book and words of wisdom help lighten the load.<br /><br />I have bought several copies of this book and have kept one for myself and gave the others to professionals in dire need of it.  This book deserves a place of high honor and no parent; professional; person on the spectrum; anybody involved with a person/people on the spectrum should go without this book.<br /><br />I was delighted to see a section devoted to intersensory marriage, that is of a neurotypical (NT) person to somebody on the a/A continuum.  I would like to see more coverage of this much needed topic as AS presents a wide array of social challenges.  Still, it is heartwarming; uplifting and encouraging to see more information devoted to intersensory marriages.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers who say Dr. Attwood is the best - I think we should propose a toast and raise our glasses to Dr. Attwood!

0375707972|4.0|Bernhard Schlink's The Reader is the story of the relationship between Michael Berg and Hanna Schmitz. The author does a very nice job of showing how the relationship, and its continually changing nature, shapes the life of the main character. The style of writing (or at least of the English translation) is an almost clinical, stoic first-person recollection. There isn't any maudlin writing here, and nothing ever feels forced or unreal. It's fiction, yet Schlink makes you feel as if it is almost autobiographical.    One thing that I particularly enjoyed in this novel was how the author leaves unanswered questions--not unresolved plot points, but dangling, almost philosophical questions. For instance, the scars left on the main character by his relationship seem to echo earlier scars left by Frau Schmitz on others. Or are they? Could they even be called scars? Is Frau Schmitz a criminal, or a victim of ignorance? I also thought that a central theme in the book, that of how pride leads to a downfall, was subtly yet very effectively reinforced through the writing, the plot, and the actions of characters.    All in all, this was a short yet engaging novel.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I rented the original movie theater release of Kingdon of Heaven and it appeared that there were some plot points missing.  While roaming through amazon's selection of movies I discovered there was a director cut and many other extras that the original did not have.  I have to say this is a way better movie.  Unfortunately movie companies feel we as a people do not have a long attention span for the length of this type of movie.  This movie needs to be seen since it is relevent to what is happening in todays world.  See the directors cut.  You will not be disappointed.

B000005RTG|5.0|Come Taste the Band was the last studio record Purple did in the 70's. And it is a great example of how a million people CAN be wrong... all those fans who ignored it because it didn't feature Ritchie Blackmore don't know what they're missing. You, my friends, on the other hand, if you are reading this, is because you're interested, and I can promise you that if you keep reading and ultimately decide to purchase this record, that interest will be duly rewarded!<br /><br />In 1975, shortly after completing an european tour in support of \\"Stormbringer\\", founding member, guitarist and resident tyrant (don't get me wrong, i'm a huge fan of his music, but the guy has serious issues...) Ritchie Blackmore left the band. An established act like Purple has 2 choices in such a situation: call it a day, or soldier on with a replacement. Purple chose the latter, and faced with that, they had 2 ways to go too: either choose an imitator and try to recapture the original sound and glory of the band, or forge ahead in a new direction. Again, they chose the latter, bravely enough. Rumor has it they originally set their sights on Jeff Beck, but unable to get him, went with a rather \\"risky\\" choice: a young yank named Tommy Bolin, with more of a background in Jazz/blues/funk/fusion than (hard) rock.<br /><br />What did they come up with? Instead of telling you first what you're gonna find here, i'm gonna tell you what you are NOT gonna find here: you're not gonna find \\"Highway Star\\", or \\"Space Trucking\\", or \\"Burn\\" or even \\"Stormbringer\\" for that matter. Meaning that those songs driven by a big, nasty guitar riff are gone. That's not a bad thing, it just IS. With the departure of Blackmore, the remaining members were given ample space to unfold their talents, and they certainly show it here: Paice never drummed better, Lord is there filling in for Ritchie with his ever immortal Hammond B3, Hughes is in fine shape both as a bassist and singer, Coverdale sings his lungs off and Bolin, while not sounding like Ritchie Blackmore (he didn't even try, which was a bold decision...) makes a strong impresion throughout.<br /><br />The band was, at least at the moment of the writing and recording of this album, rejuvenated and reinvigorated, and it really shows. My only observation would be about the vocals: how come there are only a few tandem vocals here? Coverdale sings the lion's share while Hughes sings two solo numbers (\\"Getting Tighter\\" and \\"This Time Around\\"), but the only song where they truly sing together is \\"You Keep on Moving\\". The tandem vocals are one of the features that originally fascinated me about Mk III, so I was hoping to get some more of those here. Still, their individual performances are consistently top-notch.<br /><br />Try to imagine a cross between \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\" and \\"Might Just Take your Life\\" and you are halfway there! Most of the songs are rather carried through by the monster grooves that the band creates: \\"Coming Home\\", \\"Lady Luck\\", \\"Getting Tighter\\" and \\"I need love\\" (the latter being one of my favorites) are the best examples of this. Then you have a few songs that are a little more guitar driven, but here again they are different: instead of big classical scales (a trademark of Blackmore), the guitar riffs have a bluesier, \\"Hendrix-ier\\" feel to them, like the case of \\"Dealer\\", \\"Drifter\\" and \\"Love Child\\" (which is a bit reminiscent of Zeppelin's \\"Heartbreaker\\"). And then you have 2 succesive HUGE songs to top it all: \\"This time around/owed to G\\" , which is a two part song, the latter being an awesome instrumental that takes us back to those jams the band became famous for, and \\"You Keep on Moving\\", a song that can remind you a bit to \\"Child in Time\\" by its atmosphere, with the harmonies of Coverdale and Hughes being a high point. This album is awesome!!!<br />So what was the problem, then? Was it too funky? Nope, actually Stormbringer is way funkier than this. Was it too soft? Nope, the record rocks big time. Wasit \\"less good\\" than previous records? Most definitely not! The reason is very simple: any band that experiences that many lineup changes is bound to lose (at least some of...) its identity, whether they realise it or not. And that's what happened here. Add to that the substance abuse issues that both Bolin and Hughes had, that would end up causing the implosion of the band and the death of Bolin shortly thereafter, and you realise that it just wasn't meant to be.<br /><br />The bottom line: if you liked Stormbringer, you will LOVE this record! So if you don't have Stormbringer, i would recommend you to get that first. If your favorites are albums such as Burn and Machine Head, this may be a little odd for you. But i honestly recommend you to get it either way. If you like good, groovy rock, you should love this one too! Great music is great music, and you should give it a try! I'm a diehard, and this is without a doubt one of my favorites.ords? Most definitely not!

B0000639FE|5.0|You're lovin' me now, aren't ya' Jerry!  Classic Cameron, classic Cruise (before the couch-jumping days), and an awesome Gooding and Zellweger.  The extras are great, and watching the cast watch themselves and talk about the film was a very interesting viewpoint (they kid Zellweger about her \\"new\\" film Bridget Jones Diary).  My wife and I love this film, and when we are both bored and tired, and don't want to watch the Matrix \\"lobby\\" scene for the 1000th time, we put this DVD in and sit back and enjoy!
B000KCHZK6|1.0|You would think NJ would of learned a little something from the dixie chix, to bad I liked NJ before but the political rhetoric I get tired of.  I wish she would just \\"Shut Up & Sing\\"
032147404X|5.0|I learned so much from this book!  The information given is so easy to understand & well written.  Subjects are broken down into individual pages, so you learn a lot without having to go through an extremely technical explanation which are a lot of times more confusing than not.  I highly recommend this book.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This is the greatest show ever put on by a performer!  No doubt about it.  Madonna has created a show that no one will surpass, except maybe herself.  If you have yet to watch the show in it's entirety, you really need to get this and watch it for yourself.  It's absolutely incredible!!!  5 stars all the way!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|All the Roadrunning is one of the best albums I've bought for a long time (and I've been buying them for almost 40 years). It's \\"a little bit country; a little bit rock n' roll\\" and that's what I like. The lyrics in these songs are musical poetry, and the guitar playing is fantastic {and shows why Knopfler is one of the best in the business}. The contrast between Knopfler's gruff voice and Harris' sweet vocal tones is magical. When Emmylou sings, the lyrics come to life.  She has a quality in her voice that commands you to do more than listen - you become engulfed in her music.
0618680004|2.0|Let me say this first:  I've read a good deal of Dawkins' work - Selfish Gene, Blind Watchmaker, River Out of Eden, Extended Phenotype, etc.  And, as a long-time former Atheist, now a Christian of sorts, I generally understand and can sympathize with Dawkins' worldview, even though I disagree.  This, however, is a sad book, where-in Dawkins' has finally ditched attempting to speak on the areas of his rather limited expertise (Biology, primarily), and is taking on religion, Christianity in particular, head-on, and in the process blunders repeatedly.  Like many similar books released as of late, it's only solid critiques crumble when faced with even the most moderately nuanced, and informed faith (folks steeped in the history of N.T. Wright, Marcus Borg, the scientific and theological insights of Alister McGrath, John Polkinghorne and/or the philosophy of Alvin Plantinga have nothing to fear here). <br /> <br />I just seems that Dawkins, a self-proclaimed rationalist, never fallows his rationality far enough to see the flaws in his own worldview, let alone be honest about them. For one, philosophical 'modernism' is long dead. The problem is this: if there is no God, and all you have is a modernist naturalistic understanding of 'truth', you can only use circular reasoning to justify your findings (and does he ever do so!), while the whole time arguing against the use of circular reasoning within other worldviews, such as Christianity - which is pure hypocracy. <br /> <br />I agree wholeheartedly with Philosopher of Science, Karl Popper, when he says, \\"I reject the naturalistic view: It is uncritical. Its upholders fail to notice that whenever they believe to have discovered a fact, they have only proposed a convention. Hence the convention is liable to turn into a dogma. This criticism of the naturalistic view applies not only to its criterion of meaning, but also to its idea of science, and consequently to its idea of scientific method.\\" Though Dawkins, a  self-proclaimed 'skeptic', adheres to naturalism, the problem with his skepticism is that he does not turn it to the foundations of his own worldview, which crumbles under its own weight of being unprovable on it's own terms. <br /> <br />Essentially, Dawkins' naturalism is like saying \\"I believe only in a, b, & c as truth, and will accept as fact only things that line up with a, b, & c\\", and then being suprised, and overjoyed, when discovering that you so-called 'facts' - SURPRISE - support a, b, & c! The reasoning is circular - which isn't , in itself bad (it's often necessary, within a post-modern epistemology), yet the whole enterprise of naturalism rejects circular reasoning, leaving naturalism internally inconsistent, and thus untenable. Isn't that at the heart of what we know as 'logic' - internal consistency? <br /> <br />Secondly, if naturalistic Darwinian evolution is assumed to be the 'guiding force' behind all that is, including our minds, chances are so slim as to be impossible - with a mind as such forces as chance & time would produce - that any 'facts' as they actually correspond to reality-as-it-is, let alone metaphysical, philosophical, and 'ultimate' answers, would be trustworthy. <br /> <br />Regarding this very issue, Charles Darwin himself wrote: <br />\\"With me, the horrid doubt always arises whether the convictions of man's mind, which has been developed from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value or at all trustworthy. Would anyone trust in the convictions of a monkey's mind...?\\" <br />(Charles Darwin, Letter to William Graham, Down, July 3rd, 1881.) <br /> <br />Alvin Plantinga, one of the world's leading philosophers and an expert on epistemology (the study of how we know what we know) and the philosophy of science, argues that there are no good reasons to suppose that natural selection (naturalistic Darwinian Evolution) is truth-conducive, that is, generally trustworthy or successful in producing 'minds' with the ability to reliably perceiveand understand the external world let alone to mentally construct even semi-accurate worldviews. He quotes contemporary philosopher of mind and philosophical naturalist Patricia Churchland to buttress this cl.. \\"She insists that the most important thing about the human brain is that it has evolved; this means, she says, that its principal function is to enable the organism to move appropriately: Boiled down to essentials, a nervous system enables the organism to succeed in the four F's: feeding, fleeing, fighting and 'reproducing'. The principle chore of nervous systems is to get the body parts where they should be in order that the organism may survive...Improvements in sensorimotor control confer an evolutionary advantage: a fancier style of representing is advantageous so long as it is geared to the organism's way of life and enhances the organism's chances of survival. Truth, whatever that is, definitely takes the hindmost.\\" (Alvin Plantinga, from \\"Naturalism Defeated\\") <br /> <br />Plantinga is basically pointing out that if philosophical naturalism denies the possibility that reality is guided or directed somehow (say, toward the creation of humans with reliable cognitive faculties) and if evolution selects only for survival value, it is highly unlikely that naturalistic evolution (unguided chance & time) would yield an evolved mind that accurately perceive reality, and therefore CAN know 'facts', apart from those most basic to survival - again, the four 'F's. If an individual is a pure Darwinian, they have no truly rational REASON to believe that they have reliable 'cognitive faculties', and therefore any theorizing from that point always stands upon a 'leap of faith' that their mind is properly engaging the world around them - with no real available evidence, apart from the fact that 'it seems to work for me' to ground that belief. As a result, \\"asserting that naturalistic evolution is true is also asserting that one has a low probability of being right inany of his assertions.\\" (Wikipedia) Quoting from another commenting on this same topic, \\"Ascribing truth to naturalism and evolution becomes self-referentially incoherent.\\" <br /> <br />That is why I do not trust naturalistic science's approach to what is 'fact' - it's incoherent, & self-contradictory - simply a 'leap of faith' within a system of thought/belief that discourages said 'leaps of faith' and is therefore internally inconsistent and proves itself not only untrue, but with no possiblity of being true. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, Science as historically practiced, is a field of study not necessariy grounded in naturalism/materialism - it can be very well argued that the scientific method not only grew out of a judea-christian-islamic (western religious) worldview, but that it wouldn't have developed at all without it, and it is ultimately within this context that it's findings make the most sense. In recent interviews all hands-on experimental scientists interviews said that the theory of darwinism, and naturalistic evolution, has absolutely no effect - positively or negatively - on their work, and without it they'd still do the exact same work that they've been at all along. Trust me, I absolutely LOVE the Sciences (having worked at a Scientific research library for several years), but the modern emphasis in some circles (mostly Biological Sciences) on Naturalism/Materialism I think we can ALL do without. <br /> <br />Anyway, combine this with McGrath's critique of Dawkins' meme theory - the fact that it, if applied consistently, actually explains to much as to explain away his theory itself.  Consider, how would we be able to know, if 'memes' were eventually proven to exist (any theory as to how this could be undertaken?), that his conceptualization of a meme were not a meme itself?   <br /> <br />So, in sum - good try Richard...you're an excellent writer (which is why you received 2 stars), but I agree with most of the literary community (the professional reviews of this book have been mediocre at best) - it appears - when I say: it seems best that you return to the biological sciences where you actually have a clue as to what you're talking about.
B00004XPPB|5.0|Filmed entirely in NYC and some in N.J. \\"Donnie Brasco\\" is one suspensful realistic gangster film. Excellent classical soundtrack by composer Patrick Doyle. Great acting from Al Pacino and Johnny Depp portraying real life  gangster Benjamin Ruggierio, and N.Y.P.D. officer Joeseph D. Pistone. I swear at times watching this movie Pacino and Depp were the charachters and forgot that these superstar actors were acting. The late Bruno Kirby plays an excellent but lovable gangster. Mike Madsen plays a tough authentic, believable Boss Sonny Black. The story for \\"Donnie Brasco\\" was taken from the real eyewitness, and experiences of former cop Joe D. Pistone. From what I've read, and from what I've seen on tv documentaries on the real \\"Donnie Brasco\\", this movie is portrayed as close to the eyewitness accounts and experiences of Joseph D. Pistone as possibly could be portrayed. Director Mike Newell did an incredible job not only directing, but going to the real Little Italy in Manhatten and speaking to real life gangsters to get a real feel of the life that real mobsters lead. Newell really did his research on Donnie Brasco, as the result is one fine realistic gangster movie. Believe me there is nothing Hollywwood about this gangster movie. \\"Donnie Brasco\\" may not be as good as \\"The Godfather\\"  movies or \\"Goodfellas\\" but as I will tell you, it is more authentic than any of the afore mentioned movies. Donnie Brasco is gory at times. There is a scene were Donnie (officer Joe D. Pistone) was forced to cut up dead human bodies to get rid of the evidence. During this time, when the real Joseph D. Pistone was undercover (1976-1981) real gangsters in NYC were performing these horrible acts. During these times real life gangsters like Roy Demeo and his Gang were performing these violent acts at will and made quite a name for themselves in La Cosa Nostra. Even the N.Y.C. Godfather himself Paul Castellano was very intimidated by the likes of Roy Demeo and his savage gang. Castellano although intimidated, tolerated Demeo for his awesome earning rackets. \\"Donnie Brasco\\" brings this horrific gangster act to life as well as the illegal money rackets going on at this time. Director Mike Newell read up on Roy Demeo and his Gang and brought their actions to the screen and left Hollywood make believe far behind. All I can say is watching \\"Donnie Brasco\\" made me see the guts undercover officer Joseph D. Pistone had. It really took a special person to do what Joe did. For all his troubles, all Pistone got was a $500.00 check, a medal and a several year stay in the Witness Protection Program. Joe D. Pistone lives in annomity today as there is still a price on his head. \\"Donnie Brasco\\" is highly recommended viewing as it is portrayed realistically and authentically. Director Mike Newell definintly left the hollywood gangster out of this film........
B000KCHZK6|3.0|This album lacks the composure of the previous two albums. Without knowing that NJ co-wrote all of the songs, any uneducated fan of hers would know that something was different about the song writing on this album-- there is a distinct lack of melody and musicality for most of this album. <br /> <br />That said, there are moments equal to the best of her earlier works, like \\"Be Somebody\\", \\"Wake Me Up\\" and \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\". But where the previous albums included wonderful musicianship from start to end, this one lacks in too many spots to enjoy in any one sitting. <br /> <br />Her attempts at political commentary (\\"My Dear Country\\"), while clearly her prerogative, seem misplaced. Instantly harshes the mellow her fans are seeking when listening to her music. <br /> <br />The cover art is interesting, but what's inside is missing the soulful sounds and impeccable musical arrangements that made her first two albums so enjoyable. If you still need your fix, try the Little Willies album-- combining the best of that one with the last half of this new album might make for what you had been hoping for since Feels Like Home (especially \\"Love Me\\", \\"Roll On\\" and \\"It's Not You, It's Me\\"). <br /> <br />Hopefully, we won't have to wait long for her to get back on track, next time with some more help from her talented friends and songs worthy of her talents.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|THIS is the Nora Jones I have come to love:  the pure voice, the melodic songs, the one-of-a-kind sound that IS Nora Jones.  Every song is fabulous.  I can't understand the low ratings from others.....<br /><br />This is rainy day music.  This is soft jazz, soul-stirring music.  This is background music for making love.  This is relaxing, unwinding-after-a-hard-day-at-work music.  THIS is Nora Jones.  Buy it and enjoy her inimitable, poignant voice.  You will not be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon's great Sci Fi series ended much too soon.  This collection contains all the aired episodes and two never before seen shows.  It has a nice blooper reel and some good background.  I found it very pleasant to watch and a great lead in to his feature film, Serenity.  The hybrid post war / western / urban feel along with a superb cast, made this show a delight to watch.  Well worth the price and a solid Sci Fi classic!
0312330537|5.0|It definitely is a long book but  fabulously narated by the author.  Being an Indian,  I realised that it took a foreigner to help me see India in an humane form.  But again the culture and the country is so vast its humanly impossible to explore all the parts of this beautiful country.<br /><br />The authors love for Bombay is something that one has to experience by living in Bombay.  It is without a doubt the most impactful city in the world.  If you love it ,  you cant live without it.  And if you hate it you will never go back there.<br /><br />The characters in the book are so wonderful one cant help but fall in love with most of them.  My favourite though is Prabhakar the guide and Gregory's first  dear friend.  His tragic death half way through made me  stop reading for two days and mourn the passing of such a vivacious and beautiful human being.<br /><br />The book is being made into a film and I hope the director Mira Nair and Johny Depp who plays shantaram will do Justice to the author's enormous efforts and capturing style.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I don't get some of these reviewers...what are you expecting?  This is her style, the way she sings and writes songs.  If it's not your thing, don't buy it...but don't expect something different than what NJ has always done.  That said, I LOVE this CD..she's such an amazing artist...
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Most KISS-o-Holics (like myself) probably know most of the footage featured here. The reason to buy this: You get the best quality (Video and Audio) possible and for us KISS fans it's all about collecting,isn't it? You get 4 complete concerts along with rare TV appearences. That' s quite a deal. The recording technology being used at that time is archaic, but still enjoyable. So, if you want to know what a KISS show was like in the 70s - get it! If you want to add a very cool item to your KISS collection - get it! If you think the SPICE GIRLS were the hottest band in the world - forget it!
B00005JOCU|5.0|for once in many years, finally a movie was well-written, well directed, e.t.c. it is not a rushy movie like so many coming out of HW today. everyone took their time to create this. beyonce is surprisingly very good, and also stunningly beautiful. i don't know what make up they used on her but i was speechless at how beautiful she consistently was. maybe it was losing the weight.lol. if so, she should keep it off. she is hot. jennifer hudson, though i found her character annoying (b/c she was so stupid and bossy), is very good, and of course her singing is what everyone is talking about (personally i still prefer beyonce's voice to her's; i don't want to hear screaming coming thru my headphones). eddie murphy is his usual self. but why he is so talented and his popularity is surviving so long in this business is b/c he is known as a great personality but can constantly seem different in each movie/ role he is in. in other words, he is always \\"eddie murphy\\" but never plays the same character twice. he is very funny, entertaining, and stands out from everyone. unfortunately, jamie foxx just doesn't seem up to par to me. everyone shines except him. i wasn't expecting him to flop at all. he is always so energetic, lively, and funny in his roles. but it seems like he doesn't know how to play this serious role. he doesn't know what to do with it, so he is just placid and boring. the songs are excellent, wonderful and catchy. dreamgirls is a classic!
015626224X|5.0|If you pick this little book up--while seated in your most comfortable chair, with a ready beverage nearby, and an empty bladder--odds are you'll finish it before you put it down again. Orwell is my kind of writer: he means what he says. This book imparts information, clearly and precisely; it is not a stylistic work, where the word trumps the meaning, and every syllabic filigree is employed. Here, the narrative is paramount (but the writing is still elegant and well-constructed). It is vastly entertaining, with Orwell's implacable candor, self-honesty, and knack for detail on full display.
0156027321|4.0|In recent years I have abstained from reading fiction but made an exception with this book as it was a gift.  The writing style is simple but highly descriptive.  The structure swift but not jarring. And the tale itself a fatastic work of imagination...A great read...and though it may not make you believe in God...it certainly will make you think, which is all you can ask of a book...
B00042YBTK|5.0|Hats off to Eric! <br /> <br />Well, you know, if you remember the 60s,  you weren't there and all of that.  mumble, mumble <br /> <br />This was one incredible live band.  Eric, Andy Summers, Zoot Money, the little dweeb who played the electric violin - this was one energetic, out-of-control band in the summer of 1968.  I'm glad they got some of that energy down on vinyl and I only wish there was a lot more!  (Live \\"Sky Pilot\\" with the on-stage explosions, bagpipes and roaring Eric, for instance).   <br /> <br />If you purchase this, its essentially a time machine. You don't get concert performances like this anymore, to put it mildly. Eric could be somewhat overwhelming, but he sure was/is lovable, soulful and unique. What a set of pipes!  - evidenced particularly here by \\"River Deep\\" and \\"Ring of Fire\\". (Jeez, didn't they have a usable take of Traffic's \\"Coloured Rain\\"?  Eric got inside of, de-constructed and  worked that one over to a \\"fair thee well\\"!) <br /> <br />Anyway, if you do like Amazon suggests and buy both this CD and \\"Every One of Us\\", which came out concurrently with this tour, you'll  get an idea of how wild and woolly the summer of '68 was.  And this was just 1/1,000,000th of what was happening musically that summer. <br /> <br />Word of warning - when you play this, some one in your house is going to hold their ears and complain: just the kind of musical effect I like! <br /> <br />One last note - no band this physically ugly would EVER get signed today -much to our everlasting regrets! These Animals definitely weren't the Backstreet Boys w/ Justin Timberlake fronting - these were moldy, hairy, patchy-looking blue collar gits from the industrial North of England, but they were \\"way into the music\\" and they as for real, baby.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|Apparently, some anti-theft feature?? My computer reports \\"illegal number of tracks\\" and doesn't recognize there's a cd in the drive. Hopefully, I can return mine to Target since I listen to most music on my computer and don't want to support super-proctective artists anyway - if I pay $$ for someone's CD, then I should be able to listen to it in any player I choose. If artists belive their work is so precious, don't release it to the public!    CD jacket design very poor - who wants to struggle getting the book back in its sleeve? Quality control apparently poor too - my package had two cds, both of which were a little scuffed up on the bottoms.    I'm hoping there's at least one decent song up here - listening to it on a portable player ... so far, there hasn't been anything that hooked my attention and made me want to listen to the entire song. Wish I'd read more of the \\"boring\\" reviews up here before buying. Shame to waste such a great voice on uninteresting lyrics!    (I should note, the CD plays ok on our Windows computers at work but I have Debian at home, so that doesn't help me very much.)

I've done different exercise videos and this one of my fav!  I reccommend it!
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock made two kinds of movies: bone-chilling thrillers that looked into the dark side of human nature, and witty adventure stories.<br /><br />\\"To Catch A Thief\\" is a sterling example of the latter kind of movie -- a chic, sleek, golden-tinted caper, full of witty dialogue and solid acting from legendary actors. Despite the taut action scenes, Hitchcock makes it feel almost like a cinematic vacation.<br /><br />Paul Robie (Cary Grant) was \\"The Cat,\\" the most notorious jewel thief in Europe, before he retired. But now impossible heists -- made in Robie's style -- are popping up all over Cannes, and he's the immediate suspect. Narrowly escaping the police, he enlists a friend to help him clear his name by capturing this new Cat.<br /><br />To do that, he masquerades as an American tourist, and gets to know pretty oil heiress Frances Stevens (Grace Kelly) and her mother. But when the Stevens jewels are stolen, Frances brings the cops down on Robie -- and now he is more desperate than ever to find the Cat, because he suspects it's an old friend...<br /><br />Hitchcock was in fine form with \\"To Catch a Thief,\\" especially since he had two great actors in the mix. Granted this isn't one of his more insightful or suspenseful movies, but it captures a sense of sly wit and fun instead.<br /><br />If \\"To Catch A Thief\\" has a problem, it's that astute viewers will be able to guess who the Cat is after about a half hour, maximum. But fortunately viewers can be distracted by Hitchcock's knack for razor-sharp dialogue (\\"What do you say?\\" \\"My only comment would be highly censorable\\") and double entendres (during an intimate lunch, Francie asks, \\"You want a leg or a breast?\\").<br /><br />It's also gorgeous to behold -- he entire movie is bathed in the golden Riviera sun, with lots of swimming, fast car chases, elaborate costume balls, and ornate hotels. But Hitchcock winds it up with a genuinely tense rooftop chase, complete with wrestling and gunshots.<br /><br />Grant is a bit grizzled (and VERY overtanned) here, but still dapper and charming enough for Robie, a thief with principles and a taste for the good life. Kelly is also quite good as an heiress who is less prim than she appears; John Williams and Jessie Royce Landis have fun supporting roles as a \\"veddy veddy English\\" insurance man and a shrewd rich woman.<br /><br />\\"To Catch A Thief\\" is a warm, sumptuous piece of classic film, with great dialogue and even better acting. Fun, stylish little mystery<br /> <br />Grant is a bit grizzled (and VERY overtanned) here, but still dapper and charming enough for Robie, a thief with principles and a taste for the good life.

I have since bought 3 more of his other books, he writes wonderfully. And unlike someone else's comments that they did not appreciate his humor, I LOVED it! I read the book over and over, before I even opened my Xmas gift of my DLSR! SO, before I ever had my 1st nice and fancy camera, I knew the proper way to take flower shots perfectly!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I grew up with Madonna (who didn't?) and I never disliked her at all.  I bought 'most' everything she did.  Then Confessions came about.  To be honest, I wasn't looking forward to an all dance disc from Madonna but it was one of the best discs (in my opinion) that whole entire year and probably my favorite of her entire catalogue. <br /> <br />With that said, I got on the bandwagon and purchased the cheapest seats to this show.  Not expecting too much more than a spectacle of a show with theatrics, dancers and Madonna crooning out her tunes - all underneath a couple disco balls. <br /> <br />After leaving the Hartford, CT shows (yes, I ended up going in a 2nd night) I had a completely new found appreciation for the woman.  I know that sounds pretty darned cliche but I must admit, it's true.  First of all - she's near 50 and is in incredible shape and how does one dance like that for a complete 2 hours?  The editing, performance, singing, etc... is all top notch.  The audio disc sound quality is perfect. <br /> <br />I think what I liked most about this show is that it wasn't pretentious (as I might have expected).  She gets out there (with complete drama - but little pretense) and gives you a show.  It's basically non-stop too. <br />Even the few classic songs presented here are completely reinterpretted and sound very fresh. <br /> <br />One thing I noticed was the Sorry remix video (one of my favorite parts of the show).  I clearly remember the video ending with Bush blinking his eyes repeatedly as Madonna said 'Don't Speak...'  In this version, he doesn't end the segment.  It could be in the editting though.  This piece was very powerful and disturbing live. <br /> <br />Granted, the live experience was something to witness (more than once) but this comes pretty close.

John is back, with sidekick Amanda, and new victims are set up for deadly misadventures.<br /><br />John kidnaps a doctor to take care of his cancer, linking her by a collar to his heartrate.  If he dies, she dies.  Meanwhile, a new victim must fight his way out of a maze compromised of other victims, victims who were indirectly or directly responsible for killing his son in a car accident.  Think pig guts!!  Amanda has some new colors to show.  Let the games begin.<br /><br />What great traps we have here!  Any horror or gore fan is going to absolutely love the pig-guts vat (nasty!), but we have chest-rippers, ice showers (close the door, its cold in there), \\"The Rack\\" (John's admitted favorite), explosive collars, and shotgun tubes.<br /><br />This movie is a \\"Do not miss!\\" for any horror aficionado, but if gore makes you queasy, you'd best stay away.  For the true horror fan, if you put butter on your popcorn, throw a little red dye into the melted butter for that added sicko effect, and ENJOY this 10 star gore fest!
B000GT7XXW|3.0|This movie is fantastic; an excellent portrayal and very moving.  The encoding carried by Amazon is subpar.  There are several scenes with dropped frames and choppy video.  Amazon has promised me that they will review the video and attempt to re-encode.  Until they do, watch the film, but get it somewhere else.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|I have been a Beatles nut all my life. Well, from the release of their first single in Australia in 1963, that is. Now we have that out of the way.....  <br /> <br />This album is remarkable not for the music, which most of us have all heard before, but for the new arrangements, mixes and general \\"mucking about\\" with already great recordings that has resulted in very interesting listening, especially in dolby and DTS 5.1 surround sound, these versions being released on an accompanying DVD in the special edition. <br /> <br />Several of the tracks are out-takes, or parts/mixes of, that are available on the earlier anthology sets. An example being the acoustic demo version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" featuring George solo with his acoustic guitar.... it is a pity that the only new recordings to be put on this album are the strings placed over the top of George on this track which I think spoils it. The version on Anthology is superior for lack of the overdubs. <br /> <br />Certainly an intersting listen if nothing else, and one that is sure to gain the Beatles both a new and a revitalized fan base being the stage soundtrack of the Cirque de Soleil show \\"Love\\"  currently playing to huge audiences in Las Vegas. No new ground broken here musically, but a Grammy for production/engineering perhaps? <br /> <br />Worth a look, epecially with the bonus DVD audio. - DJB
0307341542|5.0|Lots of hype for a first novel usually means an average story with a huge publicity budget. Boy was this an exception. Simply terrific, and I mean that in the eerie's possible way. One of the darkest, blackest, depressing, gut-wrentching \\"thrillers\\" I've ever read. I simply could not put this incredibly addictive novel down. Bravo Ms. Flynn.  I can hardly wait for your next novel.  There's nothing joyous, uplifting or even borderline happy here, but if you can handle that grab this book quick, you will not be disappointed.
0800141660|5.0|I love Emma Thompson's performance.  This is a real love story.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Madonna is known for her infectious songs and her spectacular concerts. I do not even know where to begin with the performance part of the Confessions show. AMAZING! I don't want to give anything away as it is filled with a lot of fun suprises. The production (lights, dancing, singing, the stage, the timing, etc...) is simply phenomenal. The show is broken up into 4 different main sections or themes. No wonder it was the highest grossing tour of 2006 - purchasing this will truly show you why.<br /><br />The live CD does not include every single song from the DVD but for sure the highlights. It is an excellent CD, as well.<br /><br />The packaging is very nice and includes several pictures.<br /><br />This is sure to be a classic and is a must have as it entertains from beginning to end and is truly mesmerizing!!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This movie is a hoot.  I love the music and the message.  You know, the ugly girl gets cute and hooks up with the slightly stuck up boy message...
B00006JKOL|5.0|This Tull gets better and better with every listen and in some ways it may be their best. Baker Street Muse is like Thick as a Brick part 2.  <br />The star of the show here is drummer Barrimore Barlow, especially in the title track.
630542845X|5.0|I loved this quirky movie.  I am glad to have it on dvd.
B00006JKON|5.0|This is a good record and it contains some of their best Queen & Country, Sealion, Ladies are all classic Tull. I don't mind the change to Sax, it's different but still good.
0521618789|5.0|The Tempest is rightly regarded as being one of the Bard's greatest works, containing some of his deepest thoughts on the nature of power and the relationship between rational man as controller of nature, and the animal man always to be at the mercy of the passions both of himself, others, and the world around him. In fact, this play could be thought of as representing Shakespeare's final and definitive statement on topics that he had explored throughout his cannon. But profound as the philosophy is, and despite the beauty of the poetry and the many magical elements contained within the play, the fact is that as far as the average attention lacking teenager is concerned, not a lot happens. This is why this Cambridge schools edition scores over most others. It is almost entirely activity focused, the expressed aim being to 'bring the play to life'. With at least one suggested activity beside each page of Shakespeare's text (as well as a decent amount of background notes and interpretation), every teacher armed with this book should be able to enthuse his charges with the very real relevance of this play to the world which we have bequeathed them.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Tull's best album and the interviews at the end are very interesting, espesially when Jeffery Hammond-Hammond says a lot of these recordings were first rehearsed then recorded in 1 take! Hense the spontenaety of this release. The star of the show here is John Evan (Hammond Organ) <br />
B000001ESN|5.0|very happy with my cd. I recieved it fast and in excellent condition.
B00000GAIW|5.0|The pro-God anti organized religion album always stirred me. Ironically  if it were recorded today their would be religious groups notably Catholics in an uproar. Ian wrote the references so cleverly that he is a genius. \\"God's not the God you wind-up on Sunday's\\" Brilliant!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I'm not usually one for scary things of any kind - the movie IT scarred me for life, I think. So, when a friend recommended it, I was pretty doubtful that it would be my cup of tea. Of course, as the title states - each episode has supernatural elements in it (and sometimes quite scary ones too!) but that's not why I enjoyed this show so much! It's the characters of Sam and Dean that really make the show, and the actors that make the characters. I am and always will be a sucker for character development, and this show certainly weaves enough of that in between the supernatural monsters, spirits and demons to make me one contented viewer.  <br />John Winchester is more drill seargent than father, at least a lot of the time.  <br />Dean, the oldest son, has totally embraced the hunting lifestyle he was raised in. He unquestionably follows and respects his father (a continual sticking point between the two brothers), but also yearns for his family to be together and safe. Overtly protective, head strong and cocky - really, really, cocky; he hides his emotions in bad jokes, pranks and his ego. <br />Sam, on the other hand, has rejected the way that they were raised. He has issues with his father that have been unresolved since leaving to go to college, but loves the guy, so he joins Dean to find him. You can tell that Dean was more of the father-figure to him than John, and a lot of my favourite parts of the show are the dialogues that Sam and Dean share. Ah, brotherly love.  <br />Basically the story of the show: John Winchester's wife (Mary) is killed by a demon, prompting him to spend the rest of his life hunting down the thing that killed her, and any other supernatural things that he happens to come across on the way. His two young sons, Dean and Sam are pulled along with him, learning how to become skilled hunters as well. The show picks up after Sam (the younger brother) decides that hunting isn't for him and leaves his father and Dean for a normal life. He has been at Stanford for two years, until Dean comes to find him with the news that their father (who maybe had finally caught wind of the demon) has disappeared. Dean asks for Sam's help to find him, and the two hit the road... <br />Anyway, the characters and scripts are what makes this such a good show. It's good to watch something that has a story and character development in each episode, as well as a long running plot within the series, as I just don't have the patience to watch more ambigous shows like Lost. Highly recommended! Can't wait for the next series.   <br />
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Ivan Reitman's 1984 mega-hit, and it's lesser sequel, are both included in this double feature DVD gift set that long time fans of the Ghostbusters should consider an absolute must own.  Chances are you already know the story: three bumbling scientists (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis) lose their campus jobs and go into business for themselves.  Only thing is, their business involves capturing and containing gross and slimy ghosts throughout New York.  Also featuring Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, and Rick Moranis; Ghostbusters ended up being a super hit which spawned an animated series, tons of toys, and a sequel five years later.  Ghostbusters 2, while nowhere near as wonderful as the first film but still pretty fun, finds the guys back in business as a new breed of evil is about to be birthed in time for New Years.  Although this isn't the first time both films have appeared on DVD, there's enough special features here to make this Gift Set worth picking up.  There's a nice selection of deleted scenes (nothing substancial), a couple featurettes, and commentary from Reitman and co., but there's no features devoted to Ghostbusters 2.  Instead, there are two animated episodes that are linked to the two films, and there's an exclusive scrap book included too with a nice variety of information for fans.  If you've already been double dipped by the Ghostbusters on DVD, picking this up is entirely up to you.  However, if you're a fan of these films and don't own them on DVD, pick this affordable Gift Set up and enjoy.
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I saw Josh Radin live last night in Chicago because a friend had an extra ticket. I had no idea who he was, but figured whatever I'm not doing anything else. Thank God I went. Radin's show was amazing and the songs he does with Schuyler Fisk are reminiscent of Damien Rice. In fact, if you check out Damien Rice's web site he actually lists Radin as one of the artists you should endeavor to see live if at all possible. I bought the CD and have been listening to it all day. It's one of those that you can put on from start to finish and every single song on it is good. $10 is an absolute steal for how good this album is. If you like mellow male vocals and well-written lyrics, Josh Radin is for you.
0525948023|5.0|I am a big fan of Mr Eckart.  Every work he says rings with truth and power.  <br />We are on for a big change in the world and this book is one of the beacons showing the way.  <br />Highly recommended and also makes a great gift!
B000A78Z82|4.0|I am astounded by people who say that \\"Cripple Crow\\" sounds 'too slick' for them. This mulligan's stew of music is so unslick that I often get distracted by the disparity. Twenty-two songs with six in Spanish and lo-fi recording that sounds like it was recorded in the woods somewhere...slick is not the word. Mystical, intimate and enthralling would be my adjectives of choice, though. Devendra Banhart has crafted a delightfully trippy excursion into his strange little world of freak-folk, a rich world inter-woven with imagistic lyrics and a decidedly anti-war bent.<br /><br />You'll hear echoes of everything from Bob Dylan, Solo Beatles Lennon, Harrison and McCartney and even a touch or two of Frank Zappa. Banhart is really fearless, musically. There isn't a genre inside his worldview that doesn't deserve trying out at least once, and if you miss listening to music that probably sounds better under a black light and something ingested (ok, I am over 40 and I admit it), \\"Cripple Crow\\" will suck you right into ecstasy. It's a total package, from the sitars and flutes inhabiting the songs to the homage to the 60's cover art. It's enough to give you faith in the underground music scene.<br /><br />My sole problem with this CD is that I feel it could benefit from some pruning. There's just too many ingredients in the stewpot to make a coherent disc, and the constant use of \\"child\\" or \\"womb\\" as a lyrical fall-back gets tedious over the duration of the disc. (As does Banhart's singing, like when he tires to go for soulfulness or when he screeches the final note of \\"Some People Ride The Wave.\\") There are songs that are downright goofy (\\"Long Haired Child\\" and \\"Chinese Children\\") and simple songs of great beauty (\\"I Heard Somebody Say\\" and \\"Inaneil\\"). It is easy to get hypnotized by the atmosphere of \\"Cripple Crow,\\" and Banhart is an eccentric with talent to burn. But for my money, any CD in 2005 willing to say \\"I heard somebody say that the war ended today...It's simple, we don't want to kill\\" is all right in my book.we don't want to kill\\" is all right in my book.
B00018D44U|5.0|This is what a woman is supposed to sound like when she sings.  Someone tell Charlotte to find another career.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This film is brilliant in every way, and may well be my favorite film. It is cheerful, hopeful and cute, and more importantly it subtly passes on a lot of good lessons, and gives kids a positive role model in the titular character.<br /><br />In today's cultural climate, it's hard to raise responsible, clever children, or even to teach them the value of reading and learning. The world needs more films like this.
B0009X7664|5.0|Great film. Not many will proably agree, but in a way, this is film noir, even though the subject material is touching. Possibly one of the most perfect films with THE most perfect opening credits (these alone will set you into a fit of tears, especially if you know the story), \\"Mockingbird\\" has inspired generations and will continue to do so. Those who know Robert Duvall now will be shocked to see him in his debut as \\"Boo.\\" Nothing bad I can say about this film.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I would give this 10 stars,if I could. I had pre-ordered & arrived in todays mail. Just watched & it is AMAZING!!! Their voices are beautiful.....favorites are Lisa,Chloe & Hayley. The last song, \\"You Raise Me Up\\" brought tears to my eyes. First time I saw Celtic Woman was on a PBS special in '05. They are touring the USA again. My boyfriend got tickets for their Tampa concert. We are really looking forward to a wonderful evening.
B000M4RG42|5.0|I'm sick of people trying to compare this movie with Saving Private Ryan.  They aren't even close enough or have enough similarities between them to compare. Saving Private Ryan was a flat-out action movie, and the character development wasn't as good as this. Don't get me wrong, Saving Private Ryan was one of my favorites, but in my opinion, Flags is better.    Flags of our Fathers is much more of a drama, and the battle scenes are stretched out in the movie, and when they do show themselves, they are brief, yet action-packed.  Since Spielberg had a hand in the movie, the characteristic color-desaturation is apparent throughout the film.  The effects are very good, and I got chills when they showed Suribachi being shelled from afar.      The character story is very deep in Flags, and you truly feel for each soldier that the movie focuses upon. Ira Hayes, played by Adam Beach, steals the show with his incredibly haunting performance.  Never in this movie did I become bored. But as for you war-movie fans who only want blood and violence, this one will probably disappoint you, although its action scenes were done extremely well.    The majority of the movie is after the three surviving flag-raisers are taken home to take part in a bond-drive. The actual war-scenes are random flashbacks throughout the movie. The rest of the movie that hasn't been mentioned takes place before James Bradley wrote the book on which the movie was based.  He is interviewing his father and such, and these scenes are quite a small percentage of the overall film, but very emotional.    Overall, this movie is one of the top films I've ever seen, and Clint's companion, Letters from Iwo Jima, was equally impressive. I was upset when Clint didn't get a best director bid for flags, but Letters is up for \\"best film,\\" so I was ok.  This movie will certainly be in the top of my collection for as long as I live.
B00082ZS5W|2.0|I'm sorry, but it sounds like she has a cold throughout this entire concert. She does not sustain the notes, her voice cracks, and her range seems truncated. I realize the monetary ramifications would have been tremendous, but either the concert should have been postponed or at least the memorializing of the concert on DVD should have waited. I notice that no one else seems to have mentioned this, but I have listened to this DVD repeatedly, and every time it makes me wince. Just one man's opinion, but buy her audio CD's, and hopefully someone will produce another DVD soon...
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I've had the new cd for a about a week now (ordered pre-release), and I LOVE it!  <br /> <br />Mind you, I don't absolutely love every single song on the album, but that's OK; it's rare when that happens, although, I do love all the songs on Norah's first two CDs and The Little Willies album. <br /> <br />What I especially love on this latest album is the use of horns and cellos...VERY cool! <br /> <br />My favorite songs from Not Too Late include: <br /> <br />-Rosie's Lullaby <br />-Until the End <br />-Not Too Late <br />-Wish I Could <br />-Be My Somebody <br /> <br />Each song on this album tells a story, so I like to listen several times to get the lyrics and understand what the song is all about. <br /> <br />Give it a listen, you'll like it too!  :)
B000021XS0|5.0|Simply put, I love this album.  I am a sucker for a good concept album anyway and for me this is the disc where Dream Theater really put it all together to create the best work of their career so far.  The album is actually a continuation of the story first told in the track \\"Metropolis\\" from the \\"Images And Words\\" album 7 years earlier.  The story is fleshed out into a murder mystery that is told (and subsequently solved) through the main characters hypnotic regression of a former life.  The tale even has a M. Night Shamlyan like twist at the end.  It is one of the best thought out musical conceptual pieces I have ever heard.  It runs like a Broadway play only with Dream Theater's incredibly diverse and intense prog metal maniacal music, lyrics and vocals, it does not sound like anything you have ever heard in the theater.  It is really difficult for me to pick out highlights on this disc as I literally love every track.  The music all runs together and shines throughout.  You want technically brilliant instrumental interplay?  \\"The Dance Of Eternity\\" will blow you away.  You want outstanding use of vocal dynamics?  \\"\\"The Spirit Carries On\\" is one of James Labrie's all time shining moments.  You want great lyrics?  Pretty much the whole album listens like a good book.  It's all here, as Dream Theater put it all together.   One thing that must be noted is the addition of former Dixie Dreg member Jordan Rudess on keyboards.  Dream Theater had previously been the home of two very talented keyboard players in Kevin Moore, and Derek Sherinian.  It is hard to believe, but Rudess is even better then those two guys or at least his style appears to be the perfect fit with the band.  As I have already mentioned I think this is Dream Theater's strongest album to date (Feb 2007 as I write this), and is honestly one of my favorite progressive rock albums of all time.  If you like your prog with storyline, and plenty of bombast or if you have ever wanted to explore just what Dream Theater do, pick this album up.
B000000W5L|4.0|By the time The Stones were working on Exile, they were in all sorts of trouble and had much more on their respective minds than making an album.  That's my opinion.  It is well known they were in financial trouble, Keith was heavy into \\"the heroin,\\" Jagger was bored with Rock and Mick was pissed that he wasn't getting the attention he deserved.  All of this added up to a not-so unified piece of work.  When this album first came out, it basically received the same review, I'm giving it now.  However, now it is like the fourth greatest album of all time, or something, according to Rolling Stone?  This coming from the same magazine that said The Beatles deserve four or five in the top ten?, come on!  This is a great album, don't get me wrong, but if you've listened to their previous works, it's not all that it's cracked up to be.
0156013983|5.0|Although I believe that this book is for everyone young or old, I think that \\"grown ups\\" will appreciate it more than kids.<br /><br />The book has passages that remind the adult of the innocent little kid within.<br /><br />In a lot of ways, the wisdom in the story comes as somehow a reality check.<br /><br />In depth the book is about life, relationships (the little prince and the rose), friendships (the little prince and the fox) and human caracteristics...<br /><br />I have read this story so many times and every time I discover something \\"new\\". This book is a work of art!<br /><br />If you speak French, I recommend the French language edition over the English one.
B000000W5N|5.0|I'm going to keep this short.  Everyone should listen to this album, sometime in their lifetime.  This album changed the way I looked at the Stones, and music in general.  Okay, I'm twetny-five, pretty young for a Stones fan, and honestly this is the first of their albums I listened to, all the way through.  From start to finish, it's a gritty, down-to-Earth rock 'n roll album, much like it's immediate predecessor, Let It Bleed.  It's full of classics, and like I said, it changed the way I look at music.  Because of this album, I gave the Stones a serious chance and soon discovered Beggars Banquet, which is now my favorite album of all time, (So far) and Let It Bleed, (mentioned above) which is another excellent Stones album.  Buy it, soak it in and let it consume you. <br />--Peace
B0000C8AVR|5.0|LIKE A ROLLING STONE and doggone TOMBSTONE BLUES, MAN!!!!  worth getting...........uncompromising songs..................a vibe of freedom...........goes against the grain...........love albums like this............period!!!!!  his voice is just one of those things!!!!!  hell, it's dylan!!!!!
B00006AW2J|5.0|The title above pretty much sums up my review. (Greatest Album Of All Time)  It's rock, with a little bit of country twang.  It's raw.  It's real.  It's on another level.  Buy this album.  It changed me.
B000002KKX|5.0|hey, i like christpher cross' early stuff.  i think this album is easy listening personified.  i got it for SAILING myself, but i was surprised at how much i enjoyed the other songs on here besides the obvious ones that you hear on the light radio stations these days.  i recommend this album to anyone looking for something to just relax and ease the mind to.
B00000F14B|5.0|We are very happy with the DVD, not only with the quality, but the price for which we paid.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|this album along with HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED and BLONDE ON BLONDE just blows my friggin' mind.  i hear a new lyric and meaning everytime i hear a dylan album.  i love MAGGIE'S FARM and MR. TAMBOURINE MAN (the only one that matters if you ask me).  IT'S ALL OVER NOW, BABY BLUE is just lovely as well.  hell, it's dylan!!!!
B00005JOCU|5.0|I didn't see the original, I never listened to the soundtrack, but this movie was spectacular! Everyone was perfectly cast for the movie.  Jennifer Hudson -- I can't say enough about her acting! She was such a natural and when she sang \\"And I'm Tellin' You I'm Not Goin',\\" the audience gave her a standing ovation!<br /><br />One thing that has bothered me, however, is that they keep comparing this fictional group to the Supremes or with Motown in general.  Personally, I don't see the connection, especially since they had the scene of Deena trying to help Effie (based on the \\"Dreamgirls\\" book by Mary Wilson, Diana definitely wasn't going out of her way to help Florence Ballard).  The group could have been any girl group during that time. If there was a strong female lead, she got top billing over the group.  They did the same with male groups.<br /><br />Jennifer, you did us proud!  Best of luck in your newfound career!!<br /><br />Anyway, I can't wait until this movie comes out on DVD -- I'll be putting it into my collection.
0517543052|5.0|All I can say is this book was life changing. <br />First read it as a Hippie Kid in '71 & it started me on a profound yogic path
B0002YLC24|4.0|This film is one of my favorites from 2004, along with \\"Sideways\\" and \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\". Is it just a coincidence that three best films of the year all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances?<br /><br />\\"Before Sunset\\" is one of the best sequels ever made but it stays on its own. It is so perfect, so simple, so sublime, so clever, so romantic, and so moving that it makes me happy to know that the films like that exist and there is hope that as characters get older we may witness their next meeting and conversations.<br /><br />Who would think that watching two people talking may be that fascinating? That's what the power of great dialog does. As much as I loved dialogs in \\"Before Sunrise\\", in this film they are even better - the characters are older, wiser, more interesting, I'd say. Ten years is a long period in a human life - our characters are still young and attractive but they've gone through losses and changes, disappointments and some sad realizations about life. It is privilege of the young age to hope that \\"there'll be many people with whom you'll connect with. Later in life, you realize it only happens a few times.\\" If we only knew how to cherish and keep these unique and unforgettable connections. If we only knew that they were unique...<br /><br />Julie Delpy along with Ethan Hawke, contributed to the screenplay; and there is no doubt that their contributions made the characters interacting on the screen absolutely honest and believable.<br /><br />Julie Delpy gives one of the best performances of the year as Celine. She is amazing in showing mystery, charm, disappointments, dreams, and the dark sides of this woman. Her singing and Nina Simone's impersonation in the last scenes of \\"Before Sunset\\" are among the most charming and seductive ever - oh yes, baby you will miss that plane.<br /><br />4.5/5>4.5/5 <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|This is perhaps the best translation to film for \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It was origianlly a miniseries, which works to give the movie more time to develop the story. It is also one of the very few film versions that carries Jane Austin's spirit. The actors all were able to capture the characters wonderfully. Colin Firth shines as Mr. Darcy. Although the movie is far from perfect (a few scenes are done a bit slowly), I completly recommend this version to any Austin fan or lovers of romance.
1582701709|5.0|I work in the field of self help.  The book is a simple clear version of many other self help books out there.  Since I have read the book my life has changed. I've used the exercise and have watch positive results unfold before my eyes. My only advice is don't give up it will happen for you too.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|In the news today, Thursday, February 1, 2007: \\"Officials from 113 countries agreed Thursday that a much awaited international report will say that global warming was \\"very likely\\" caused by human activity, delegates to a climate change conference said.\\"  That's right.  Scientists and climate experts in ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN countries!  Not just a handful of Democrats in the USA.  Wake up people!!!  Your denial is choking us!!! <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This dark comedy is the best movie of 2006!  I don't want to be cliched but the movie is heartbreaking and funny and every emotion in between.  The ensemble cast is amazing--all are worthy of Best Supporting Acting Oscars.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|I stand amazed at the reviews of this album. They miss the mark... by a mile! Some folks want to make Norah Jones into something she just ain't. She is what she is; a fine singer, and now song writer. Her tempos have generally been slow before. I just don't think people are listening to the lyrics - thoughtful, original and reflective. That she wrote them herself shows tremendous growth. One person wrote this is an album to make love by. Oh pleeeeeeease. She is also not a cool jazz performer. She doesn't fill a specific niche. This is what I like; she combines jazz, country, folk, soul, et al. This is also a wonderfully recorded album by Blue Note - imaging, soundstage, and presence to boot. Blue Note took their time in making this one - thanks. Hey, if this isn't your bag, move on.
B000M4RG42|5.0|It's become so common for film companies to release a film and then 2 months later to bring out the \\"director's cut\\" or 2 disc version etc. The last several Clint Eastwood films have had 3 disk versions. Given the soon (although unannounced) release of Eastwood's \\"Letters from Iwo Jima,\\" does anyone out there know if Paramount has planned a collectors edition or special release of both both films together? I am so sick of buying a film only to have a \\"better version' come out shortly after.
B000A2XC1C|4.0|What a cute 80's movie!  As an adult I still enjoy it........it had been a long time since my last viewing.  I look forward to showing this movie to my children.  Definitely a magical way to enjoy Christmas time.

B00006GFAB|3.0|What are you people, nuns!? This is a Kiss collection, not Limp Bizkit or Lamb of God, there probably isn't even an a-word mentioned in any of these songs! Stop smoking the weed Amazon!<br /><br />Good collection, but there is too much 70's and not enough 80's or 90's. Feel greedy, Paul and Gene? Well then make a 2-disc greatest hits, one with their 70's through early 80's and the other with a compilation of their greatest post-Dynasty hits.
B00003CXA6|5.0|It's a great movie.  I bought it, watched it, and will watch it again.  However, I'd much rather watch the extra scenes version.  So why can't I buy that on DVD?  I saw it once on TBS.  I know there was a VHS version out there about a decade back.  But I haven't heard anything about the longer version since.
0553801503|4.0|Let's be clear.  I love this series.  I read the first three in the series again so I could put this one in context.  The only other work of fiction I have ever read more than once is The Count of Monte Cristo, so that should indicate how much I love Martin's work.<br /><br />This book is a good sequel.  I think it lost something because of the way it was revised for early publication. Intertwining the other characters (left for A Dance with Dragons) made some of those in this book seem overworked.<br /><br />It is also less fast paced because Feast consolidates the scene in Westeros it doesn't advance the Ball very much. It cleans up some loose ends and does give us a much better picture of Westeros overall, but not much happens. Although change does begin at the very end.<br /><br />This pace, however is consistent with the history being told and it is not an objection, just an observation.  The mop-up operations and the political maneuvers at the end of a civil war should be a time of relatively slow pace in developments.  We get that sense and also get to learn about other parts of Westeros and other factions.<br /><br />Martin's character development continues to be superb in all but one minor respect.  Its only flaw is Cersei.  She is too flat, typically \\"bad\\" and not complex. You can predict, unlike almost any other characters, her actions and reactions and her direction and downfall.  She is never surprising or likeable, unlike Jaime, Tyrion, Jon, Sansa, Arya, Sam, Brienne, Dany et. al.  Because she advances the story and she is not badly crafted or developed, the flaw is a minor one, possibly only noticeable because of the complex and generally unpredictable nature of all the other characters. One minor flaw in 4000 pages isn't bad.<br /><br />Undoubtedly Dance for Dragons will take longer than expected.  Maybe I will reread them all again.
B000J10ERO|4.0|<br />This is a stylish return for Superman - Brandon Routh is impressive in the role and, when in Clark Kent role, occasionally bears an uncanny resblance to the late, great Christopher Reeve. It was never going to be easy to follow Reeve's performance, but Routh delivers the goods. <br /> <br />The story connecting the new movie with what has gone before is clever and benefits from some fantastic effects. I was unsure about Kevin Spacey in the role of Lex Luthor, but he finds a nice balance between comic sarcasm and unbridled brutality.  <br /> <br />The weak link in the story for me concerns Lois Lane's son (and her convenient unmarried relationship to the new man in her life). That seemed all a bit pat. However, it's a very small point that not everyone will agree with. This movie is the best one since the first one with Christopher Reeve. It's excellent entertainment and sets the scene for possible follow-ups. Brandon Routh now IS Superman!
B00005AREQ|4.0|An interviewer once asked Eddie, \\"I understand you were influenced by Jeff Beck.  Was the album Truth?\\".  Eddie said \\"No, I was very influenced by 'Blow by Blow'.\\" <br /> <br />If you've ever wondered where Eddie got those flamboyant, extrapolated string bends, it was from Beck on this album.  Eddie'd mastered Cream style classic soloing and was looking for something more out - in this album, he found a clue to the path.  Not that Eddie sounded like this when he got done, but this album gave him the ramp to get to where he got.

B000068IEU|2.0|I guess I missed the point. I can see how this film could be considered a horror \\"classic\\". I'm sure the violence was ground breaking in 1972... in fact, one of the comments in the \\"making of\\" on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres. I don't think it's a well done film overall... it's lacking in story, music, direction, and suspense. The acting is not too bad, but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes. If I was craving some good 1970's horror, I'd rather watch \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" or \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\".
B000A3VTT8|5.0|This DVD is spectacular.  Visually it is as good as high def, which I don't have.  The singing and acting are as good as it gets.  All the principals are in their prime and the acting is a model for future singers to learn from. <br />One of the best buys possible for this opera.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|The funny thing is how much press and publicity is generated by this subject, when the total amount of greenhouse gases that are put into the atmosphere by mankind is a MINISCULE FRACTION of what is put into the atmosphere from natural sources.  Humans are not responsible for global warming. It is a natural phenomenon!  Unfortunately, democrats have fooled uneducated people into thinking that it is caused by humans, and that the only way to save our world is to vote for them.
0060974176|5.0|This book provides an excellent introduction to lean techniques.  I am college student majoring in mechanical engineering and needed something that could give me an overview of lean production and help me understand how it differs from mass production.  The book certainly meets that criteria.  While it does not give many case studies of how companies can convert to lean production, \\"Lean Thinking\\" by the same authors does do that and is also an excellent book.   <br /> <br />The authors performed many years of research before publishing their data and can provide hard numbers to back up their claims that lean production is simply a better method.  If you're looking for something to introduce you to lean production, this is the book to get.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|This show used to be in syndication, then stopped showing it. I wondered when it would come out on DVD. I really enjoyed this TV series. Looking forward to the next seasons, b/c I enjoyed it more when they were Seniors in High school.
B00000K0DV|2.0|Although the Italian horror/slasher genre of the 1970's includes many films that aren't exactly Disney-esque, I found \\"The New York Ripper\\" to be a particularly unpleasant ride.  Lurid violence, depressing cinematography (90% of the film is dark and grainy), and choppy (no pun intended) storytelling made this more of an ordeal than the guilty pleasure I expected.  Check out \\"Strip Nude For Your Killer\\" and \\"The Case of the Bloody Iris\\" for more polished, entertaining examples of the \\"giallo\\" form.  That is, unless you really, really want to see a movie about a serial killer who quacks like a duck.

B000JK8OYU|3.0|Everyone has about 42 versions of all of the songs on this album but it nevertheless presents a fresh take on songs we know by heart. The remixes and alternate takes vary tremendously in effectiveness, with some virtually indistinguishable from the original. Others -- notably \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" -- provide provocative new spins.  <br /> <br />Anyone familiar with \\"The Gray Album\\" knows how effectively the Beatles can be used as samples -- Jay Z's \\"99 Problems\\", as remixed by Danger Mouse, is a great example -- but this collection doesn't sustain that level of creativity.
B000777J2S|5.0|sometimes i get so startled when i listen to antony & the johnsons. this feeling crashes inside me and it feels so powerful, i want to hide under the covers of my bed and dream and cry about how good it is to feel. becos if i didnt feel this... i dont think i would even begin to understand what all this even means. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"its true i always wanted love to be hurtful and its true i always wanted love to be filled with pain ... i am very happy so please hit me, i am very very happy so please hurt me, i am very happy so please hit me, i am very very happy so come on hurt me\\" <br /> <br /> <br />theres a consistency in antony's vocals that fall from the deeply impacting human necessity to love, to fear, to face change and to feel different from the rest of the world. as his music and lyrics build upon one another, an exceptional dramatic range addresses the darkest of hidden places as sensitivity through elegance and grace infuses a secret romantic frequency from deep inside the heart. whether its suppose to be much more than what it seems, its hauntingly emotive and only intensifies to unveil the beauty of who antony is. <br />
B00082ZS5W|5.0|You will love this DVD. It is worth every dime you spend on it!
B000KCHZK6|2.0|I was hoping that the negative reviews were not correct but I have to agree with them.  This cd is such a disappointment after years of waiting.  Too mellow, too low key, too one sided.  We know from live performances and collaborations (such as with the Peter Malick Group) that Jones is not a one-trick-pony and that there is so much more potential.  Why she chooses to go the safe route on her own cd's is a mystery.  This cd is not horrible but it's not great either. I'm not in a hurry to listen to it again and that's a shame.
B000H30B2C|5.0|Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' is to me the best installment by far.<br /><br />From casting to capturing the feel of the 1930s; the directing is splendid. I'm a fan of Jack Black and was a little sceptical at first about how he would pull off his role until I saw him in action. Adrien Brody also held his own, but more impressive to me was Naomi Watts.<br />The relationship between her and Kong was one that U could 'really' feel, especially in the scenes where he protected her against the wild prehistoric creatures.<br />I think anyone who may not have seen this movie yet will be impressed with the look of the sunset and skyline scenes as well as the dark and frightening feel of Skull Island and the primitive people who lurk there.<br /><br />Also notable is the special effects of which my 'favorite' is the creation of the gigantic insects that the crew had to fight off.<br />Spectacular!<br /><br />Say what U will about Peter Jackson's previous work but I think he deserves an A+ for bringing Kong to life once again.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|I just first listened to this cd yesterday and I had a small chance to listen to it again today.  At first I did not get wowed by it but I'm starting to find out I really like this cd.  I'll write more after this weekend is over.  OK the weekend is half over and I'm now hooked on this cd.  I've never heard a song quite like Sinkin' Soon, but I love it.  Jones wrote or co-wrote every song on this cd.  I am surprised I have not heard many played songs on the radio.  Thinking About You and Broken stood out as a songs I liked instantly.
B000IHY9SE|5.0|\\"Returning to the crazy Eminem that Dr. Dre introduced us too\\" should be the title in my opinion.  <br /> <br />  In Em's last 2 albums he has strayed from his roots, the type of music that made him famous, but it's all back in this mix tape.  Of course this is only a \\"Mix Tape\\" and Em is only on 6 tracks, but those 6 tracks are fierce as ever. There is no more pop - mainstream beats or lyrics on this album, just crazy rhyme spitting from the best in the business.  <br /> <br />  Eminem has made a living off his Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde personality, however in Em's previously released Encore it was all Eminem & no Slim Shady to mix things up. You had songs like Mockingbird & Hailes song where I suppose Em was attempting to show his versatility. It  fell flat to true hip hop heads however and we though Em's best days were over.  <br /> <br />  In the RE-UP you'll not see any love songs! You get Slim Shady at his craziest along with Obie Trice, 50 cent, D-12 and G-Unit, also there's some proteges who the album  who Shady Record are trying to introduce us too. They are Cashis & Bobby CreekWater and they are pretty good truthfully. The RE-UP & it's crew of artists remind me of 2pac and the Outlaws album, Thug Life which was very street oriented. I believe that's what Em is shooting for here with these youngsters. <br />  <br />  I honestly thought Em had lost his game, but the RE-UP proves me wrong! <br />Not only is Slim Shady still relevant, when he is on top of his game he's the best out there! <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Celtic Woman - A New Journey: Live at Slane Castle, Ireland(2007)  is an excellent piece of musical videography.  The girls which include Hayley Westenra, a powerful signer in her own light, all perform a masterfull piece of production put together by the team of video director Declan Lowney, and orchestra director David Downes.  The DVD is excellent.  The girls are talents in their own rights including the high-spirited fiddle playing of Mairead.  The set that surrounds the historic Slane Castle is wonderfully put together, that binds the background of the castle, orchestra and group together.  The Celtic Woman group is a must see if they are coming to your area on their upcoming tour. <br />
0696204800|4.0|Useful book with multitude of block patterns - I like especially the variety of applique designs. I have one problem: the binding is too tight to enable proper photocopying of designs on inside of pages, a nuisance when you want to enlarge a pattern.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|When I first heard about the \\"LOVE\\" CD, I did not know that the songs were actually remixes and overlayed on top of each other. After spending 17 years of my life doing remixes and editing songs, I was NOT ready to hear this done to the \\"sacred\\" work of the Beatles. And I found out (from reading other reviews of the CD) that I was not the only person that felt this way. To a lot of fans, doing this to Beatle songs was the same as painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa would be to art lovers.    After listening to the \\"LOVE\\" CD, all I can say is, \\"Hand me the paint brush and tell Mona I'm coming\\". The job done by George Martin and his son is a work to be appreciated, even if you are a die-hard Beatle fan.    In order to pull this project off and make it \\"work\\", you would need to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the Beatles recordings, from the ground up, which Sir George certainly does. You also need the studio chops to do the work. Again, no problem there. But most importantly, you would need to understand that the Beatles were innovators and were willing to experiment with not only sound but also with recording techniques, new instruments, different arrangements, playing tracks backwards, multiple track recording etc. All of these things have been taken into account in the creation of the \\"LOVE\\" CD. It comes very, very close to being, in effect, a new Beatles CD.    The flow of the CD is very well done. Even if the material was pulled together for a \\"soundtrack\\" to a Las Vegas production, it is well thought out for a listening experience. The choice of material is a good representation of the Beatles entire recording career, from Parlophone to Apple. And the production values are stellar, considering that these recordings are 40+ years old. I have never heard John, Paul, George & Ringo sound THIS GOOD!    I would recommend this CD to anyone who:    1. Appreciates the Beatles  2. Appreciates creativity and the willingness to experiment, and  3. Anyone who has neverheard the Beatles (if such people truly exist)    George Martin gets a big ol' thumbs up from me for this effort. Now..... Howzabout \\"LOVE 2\\"????

B00000F14B|4.0|The Movie has always been a favorite of mine.  If you have a big screen TV, this movie on DVD will appear to be sloppy in some areas, but if you just follow the story and enoy the music, you'll over come the critical nit picking of your prefectionate self.  Go look in the mirror by the way.<br /><br />I recommend this product for purchase.
048640658X|3.0|Of course Shakespeare's TEMPEST is an enchanting--and enchanted--play, but my comments here concern the DOVER THRIFT EDITION of the play.  Dover is to be commended for making texts such as these affordable for readers on a budget.  However, students and teachers alike should note that the Dover edition does not supply line numbers.  Students who are considering this text for a class and may have to write about it will not be able to cite specific line numbers as is convention (Act.scene.lines; e.g., 3.1.34-47).  Professors and teachers should also be aware of this limitation and weigh it against the affordability of this text.

B000GFLE86|5.0|I confess I didn't actually buy this album for my own listening pleasure... at first.  I was familiar with Peyroux's sound and thought my 82 year old grandmother might like it.  Honestly, I never really paid much attention to her tastes in music before, but I was feeling guilty that I missed her birthday last month.<br /><br />Well!  She raved so hard and so long about it that I had to give it a listen myself... and have decided that if this is the kind of stuff Grandma likes, maybe I should have been paying attention!<br /><br />Peyroux's voice is compared to Billie Holliday's in every review... but since I have only a passing acquaintance with Billie Holliday I feel I was able to listen to this album on its own merits, of which there are plenty. By turns sweet and longing, her voice on these tracks convey emotions that range from nostalgic to flirtatous to melancholy and back again by way of wistfullness. Although this album could be dismissed as \\"ambiance\\" for its easy sound and gentle melodies, it really is a rich experience that is due a deeper listen. Even if you just put it on for background sound, you'll find yourself thinking about it hours later... returning for just a little reminder of that sweet moment in sound.
0670033375|2.0|I'm with the guy who remarked that he'll never be able to read the phrase \\"de-forestation\\" without feeling browbeaten.  This book is what happens when you accidentally write a best seller (\\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\") and think that now you're an author.<br /><br />1. The book reads like it was dictated and transcribed, with no limits on personal expresson.  Not much discipline in evidence here.<br /><br />2. Heavy-handed references to our current situation in the world larded throughout, just in case the reader is entirely incapable of connecting the dots.<br /><br />3. Book is at least twice as long as it needs to be  -- isn't anybody thinking about deforestation in the printing of this tome?<br /><br />A lot of gratuitous reflections and observations by the author here, probably reflecting a heightened sense of self-importance transcending his prior professional experience of 40 years as an ornithologist in the New Guinea rain forest.<br /><br />I'm only halfway through this, so maybe by the end I'll have a more favorable impression -- if I can get that far.<br /><br />-- Roy Zider
B00070Q7VO|5.0|A modern Sinatra. Michael Buble is smooth and easy on the ears. A welcome relief to what's out there nowdays. With most music you can listen to samples before you buy it, here and even at most stores. So there should be no shock value to whether or not you like the music when you receive it. You do have to be aware of ones tastes though before buying.

B000ICM5W6|4.0|Let's face it, Tinseltown has run out of original story lines. That's usually when they turn to remakes. I've seen several remakes over the years, both TV and movie, but this is one of the best remakes I've seen in quite some time. I really enjoyed how they expanded on the original story line. What a lot of people need to understand is that this movie had nothing to do with the TV show and pulled all of it's story from the comic book. If you were never into comics to begin with then you can't appreciate the story line.  <br /> <br />Another thing that I feel is under appreciated about this movie is the CGI. People have to understand that if they got some body builder and slapped green paint on him than the movie would have been a complete waste of time! The amount of man hours that went in to creating the CGI is something to be applauded and appreciated, not mocked and thrown out with the trash. You have to appreciate the movie for the story line and its artistic value.  <br /> <br />Most people were upset with this movie because they thought it was too slow and it should have been more fun and had a lot more action in it. <br /> <br />The story of the Hulk is a sad, depressing, dramatic story! There isn't anything funny about being zapped with radiation and transforming into a mindless brute evertime you get ticked off about something. <br /> <br />The Hulk wasn't meant to be campy, it was meant to be serious.  <br /> <br />My only gripe about this movie is that they could have picked a better actress to play Banner's love interest. The little amount of screen time she was given was completely wasted.
044100590X|5.0|\\"Dune\\" is an unusual science fiction novel in that it takes place thousands of years in humanity's future, but there are no computers. Instead, the universe of  \\"Dune\\" is shaped by organic concepts: mysticism and ecology, intelligent machines having been banned. Great Houses govern their planets as fiefdoms. Duke Leto of the House Atreides is sent to rule the desert planet Arrakis, the source of the spice melange, upon which all economic, social, and political structure depends. The drug facilitates preternatural computational and intuitive abilities in its users. The Harkonnen Baron, a ruthlessly ambitious leader of a rival House, plots the murder of Duke Leto, his concubine Jessica, and their teenaged son Paul in order to reclaim Arrakis. But he has underestimated young Paul, who may be the prophesied savior, a male who possesses the greatest powers of the female mystic sect Bene Gesserit. And he has underestimated the fierce Fremen desert people, whose ambitions and accomplishments defy their primitive reputation.<br /><br />\\"Dune\\" excels in evoking a culture with values very different than our own but connected to us by bits and pieces of Islamic and Christian doctrine that readers will recognize. The unusual social structure and value systems of these future humans appeal to the imagination. And the ability to read what the characters are thinking  -always in italics- involves the reader in their lives and minds. The only fault I find with the novel is that it is long, spending more time than necessary on Paul and Jessica's flight through the desert and struggles amongst the Fremen. But the excessive time spent with some characters does immunize \\"Dune\\" from the poor character development that is common to science fiction. The politics of the story are utterly arcane. But author Frank Herbert has grasped the idea that cultures are defined by their limitations, and he makes excellent use of Arrakis' limited water supply as the defining characteristic of Fremen society. \\"Dune\\"'s vivid cultures and page-turning adventure make it one of the great works of science fiction.society. \\"Dune\\"'s vivid cultures and page-turning adventure make it one of the great works of science fiction.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This Anime was produced shortly after Daft Punk's Discovery album. Discovery is the soundtrack to the feature. There isn't any dialogue other than what is implied by the action. There are some environmental sfx, but not many. If you love Daft Punk & Anime, this is a must have. It is very entertaining & somewhat humorous - with a very positive & happy vibe. The plot is complex enough to keep you interested, but simple enough to follow with no dialogue. It's a great album & a great movie. -_-

B0000584V3|3.0|A friend recommended Opeth to me. Now I have limited knowledge of death metal and usually listen to rock, prog, or jazz, but new musical experiences are a must and I picked \\"Blackwater Park\\" because it seems to be a favorite of Opeth fans. I've been listening to this for over a year and like the music, dynamic changes, and musicianship but I'm not a fan of growl vocals. I don't find monotone speech musical. The diversity of this album was surprising. \\"The Leper Affinity\\" changes from brutal to calm in an instant and the transitions are smooth, \\"Harvest\\" is a great popish song and the non-growling vocals on this song are relaxing, and my favorite, \\"The Drapery Falls\\", is intense with an intro/outro riff that sounds similar to King Crimson's \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\". Definitely interesting, and the high ratings are warranted if you like this style of music, but it's out of my league because of my issues with growls.
B000J103PC|4.0|I didn't read the book, but my daughter did. I didn't want to watch the movie, but my daughter put it on and she had a bowl of popcorn sitting next to her. Call me weak and a \\"dad\\" but I sat down more to share a movie with her and to steal a few bites of popcorn than to watch the chick flick.<br /><br />However, the movie was funny and engaging. There are other reviews that lay out the plot. It's not complex, it's not thought provoking. But it's a strange (and from what my daughter says) not completely outlandish view of the fashion industry.<br /><br />I enjoyed it. Maybe you will too.
0452286379|5.0|I have read nearly all of Ayn Rand's works and have to say that next to Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead is her best.

B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Unlike the 1995 BBC version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you will not doubt that you are watching a film and not reading the book.  The previously mentioned movie was taken almost exactly from the book.  However, while this version isn't perfection, it comes very close. <br /> <br />Perhaps the main problem with most productions of Jane Eyre is the portrayal of Rochester.  In many productions an actor may be able to convey Rochester's fiery temperament, but not his philosophical playfulness or tenderness.  Other actors may have down the philosophical qualities, but they are usually overdone to the point that Rochester seems completely out of touch with everyone.  Still other Rochesters get all the passion, but forget that there is more than sex on this man's mind.  However, Toby Stephens has portrayed Rochester to perfection.  When you see this production, you will immediately see the perfect balance of mischievousness, wrath, passion, playfulness, thoughtfulness, and melancholy that makes Rochester so difficult to portray. <br /> <br />However, there are two matters which prevent me from giving this production an outright 5 star perfection. <br /> <br />Firstly, there is very little time spent on Jane's childhood, and Miss Temple is completely absent.  But, surprisingly, I didn't feel too cheated.  The director and writer came up with a very agreeable way of incorporating much into a very short sequence of events.  Any book enthusiast will be pleased. The alterations were not drastic. <br /> <br />Secondly, I do have probably the most problem with Jane's departure from Thornfield.  This is the only time that Rochester does not live up to his full potential.  Instead of being nearly violent, as in the book, there is instead some quiet coercion in Jane's bedroom.(Don't worry. It's just the location for the chat.  They are only talking in this scene). Instead of being threatening, he is pleading.  However, I don't think this is any faulton Stephens's part. I believe this to be the work of both director and writer, as this scene is also segmented through the entire second half of the film. <br /> <br />Altogether, with the combination of acting talent, good writing, and excellent directing, I think this a nearly perfect production.  The scenes have almost been taken word for word, and where they haven't been, the spirit of the book has been maintained to perfection.  <br /> <br />As I said, there is really only one scene I can really quibble about, and really it was't enough of a disappointment to keep me from buying a copy immediately after viewing it.  I am extremely pleased.  Don't waste your time on other productions.  This is the one.

Do not buy this DVD based on this information! <br /> <br />You would think that a new release of this title would include an English audio track, after all the complaints after it's initial release in Hebrew, with English subtitles. <br /> <br />I don't know about anyone else, but I want to 'watch' a movie, not 'read it'! <br />
0784011710|5.0|Meryl Streep is sensational. No words can do justice to describe how amazing her performance is.
B000001GRE|4.0|Mahler's 7th is a tough and perhaps uncrackable nut. Interpreters like Bernstein perform the equivalent of plastic surgery, tart it up emotionally, and makes excuses that Mahler really intended the final movement as a \\"parody\\" of \\"kapellmeistermusik\\". Boulez lays the patient etherised on a table and does an autopsy. Diagnosis: this IS kapellmeistermusik!<br /><br />For classical music collectors, having several versions of a work is essential to understanding the piece. Rarely is there a \\"definitive\\", only-recording-needed version. If you think you \\"know\\" Mahler's 7th but haven't heard this version, you're kidding yourself. Sonically outstanding, too.
B00006F7S4|5.0|As an old Beck fan, I bought this album on its release date without knowing one thing about it. The result was listening to it every day for weeks and weeks.     I was amazed by every melody of this album and not so much because it's truly original (that might be a subjective statement), but because it added so much depth to Beck's persona as a musician and songwriter. He suddenly became 3D and human for the first time since One Foot in the Grave. The lyrics are far more straightforward and heart-felt than any previous release, which I think is a core reason for some people's disappointment - you might love the word play from Odelay and Mellow Gold, but that doesn't mean you can't appreciate something serious and trust me, this album is very serious. In my experience, it's easily the most depressingly lovely album since the Cure's Disintegration. I'm not comparing the sounds by any means, just the sadness they convey.    Hard to pinpoint standout tracks, because it's really best listened to as a whole and there are no weaknesses. I guess if I had to choose my personal favorites, they would be \\"The Golden Age\\", \\"Guess I'm Doin' Fine\\", \\"Lonesome Tears\\", \\"Lost Cause\\" and \\"Sunday Sun\\". Honorable mentions to \\"Little One\\" and \\"Round the Bend\\".     While I don't doubt that Beck is always questing to push his own limits and explore uncharted waters, this album clearly stems from the notion of self-therapy & healing vs. producing something that will sell. I have an artist friend who was actually angry that Beck \\"let down his fans\\" with Sea Change; if you don't like it, that's fine....but don't pin your preferences on one's artistic integrity. Unbeknownst to most of the pre-canned, garbage bands out there, it's not a musician/artist's job to please others, it's their job to make music/art that they want to make. People liking it is just a bonus.  But shhhh, don't tell the record companies...you might rock the boat.    Cheers to Beck for marching to his own beat, again.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|After her stunning and brilliant Direction of BLEAK HOUSE last season, Susanna White creates a visually stark and beautiful to look at version of JANE EYRE.  But this is not Bronte's Eyre... in fact it is one of the most mentally wrong versions I've seen. You'd need to go back to the 1930s early talkie version with Virginia Bruce to find a Rochester as simply wrong in every way as Toby Stephens is here.<br /><br />A lot of this problem is the script, which translates Rochester and Jane into the mental set of a two-timing husband trying to pick up a shy co-ed in a singles bar.  Just plain ikky.<br /><br />JANE EYRE is difficult to translate well onto screen because her major relationship in the book is NOT with Rochester, it is with God, it permeates her upbringing, her time at Rochester's house, her struggles, her time at the house of the Pastor & his sisters, her refusal of missionary work, and the end.  Bronte was a brilliant, incisive religious thinker who used this story to pinpoint that a relationship with God can be a reason to relieve yourself from mission work for the wrong reasons, just as it can be a drive to deny your heart's wish because that, too is wrong.<br /><br />Even if you take out bits of the story, you can retain this mindset.  When you remove this mindset, which THIS gloriously costumed, photographed, and settinged production does, you deteriorate the characters into \\"Jane and Rochester Rock the Canopy Bed\\".  That should have been the title of this one... so very WB network (or now CW network).<br /><br />This is my favorite book, & I've seen - several times - almost every version made of this story, and have a collection of it.  Not only do I not want this version, I could not make myself watch all of it - I kept turning it off and coming back.  I was disgusted by watching Jane and Rochester snog on the sofa and put down Miss Fairfax.<br /><br />So wrongheaded, Bronte must be spinning in her grave like a silkworm junkie that needs a fix.  JANE EYRE is the story of two physically unattrative people, drawn together by understanding of their souls.  There has not been ONE version yet that has cast BOTH roles this way, and I defy a major studio to do it.  (The closest was probably Zefferelli's version.)<br /><br />Ruth Wilson, tall, elegantly slender, not beautiful, but in every way attractive by today's standards, and Toby Stephens, the greasy-haired six-pack ab workout hottie, are both about as wrong as you can get physically.  The 40s version with Welles and Fontaine took tremendous liberties with the book and they're both attractive, but they both eminate the souls found in the book in a production that just reeks of the spirit.<br /><br />But the real corker here is the way Rochester is written and played. He might as well be mubbling his way through a Sam Sheppard play!  If you are seriously REVIEWING this DVD you HAVE to distinquish between lusting after Toby like pre-pubescent teens & Rochester the timeless character.  Good young actor, nice bod, completely wrong for Rochester.  Even Gorgous Timothy Dalton was better because he had the right mental stuff going on.)  Best Rochester ever is Ciarin Hinds in the version with Samatha Morton.  HE is still too tall, too handsome, but WOW.  100% got the book down.  (Morton, on the other hand, a fine actress, looks the part but sneers and smirks like a demi-monde courtesan... wierd, wierd choices.)<br /><br />So this missed effort - I gave it a 3 - Why so high?  The production values are that high.  Really, that detail correct, that beautiful to behold.  Which makes the sum of the parts that much more insufferably frustrating.  Poor Charlotte, still misunderstood.a fix.  JANE EYRE is the story of two physically unattrative people, drawn together by understanding of their souls.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|With the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice the BBC set a new standard for literaty adaptations. Fortunately it's one that they've been able live up to, Most recently in this recent adaptation of Jane Eyre.     Overall it's a highly recommended adaptation. Is it 100% true to the novel? No but  since that's not really what I look for in an adaptation. The question is, does it stand on it's own merits? Yes.     Ruth Wilson is really likable as Jane Eyre and I think that she has a exciting career ahead of her. I look foreward to seeing what she does next. Her Jane is less plain than others are and probably less so than Bronte wrote the character. From the begining there's a sparkle in her eye. She's less repressed, and all the brains and spirit that are initially well hidden in Bront's Jane are bubbling just beneath the surface of Wilson's.  Likewise, Toby Stephen's Rochester is younger and better looking than I usually imagine the character. But his harshness is tempered with a wonderfully sardonic wit. He's a man who has had a difficult life but he looks back on it with a rueful sense of humor.     Once or twice it seemed as if the filmmakers were trying to make the film \\"sexy\\" in unnecessary ways. At one point Jane saves Mr. Rochester's life. When he  thanks her, he asks to shake her hand. Instead he takes both her hands in both of his and moves in very close. I was truely expecting a make-out scene. It just seemed more Supermarket Checkout Line Romance, then Victorian Gothic Romance. It's a romantic story to begin with- no need to turn it into a bodice ripper. These scenes aren't needed but the chemistry between the leads makes them work.     A few reviewers have critized the two leads for being too attractive, betraying the idea of the book. However that assumes that the book is about ugly people falling in love. It's not. It's about a woman growing and establishing herself in life without the benefit of money, social connections or an exceptional physical appearance. Jane Eyre had endured as a work of literature due to the romantic and at times suspensful nature of the plot, the strong sense of atmosphere, a sense of with and intelligence and above all an immensely likable heroine (despite or perhaps because of her lack of glamour) While it leaves out a few potions of the novel, this film preserves the important qualities.
B00000DQWT|3.0|This is the CD that has the simply named song, Chris, a favorite on my local smooth jazz station.  The other songs are listenable, but less interesting.  If you really like Chris, you'll probably like the similar This is Not America, too.  There are a few other songs that are worth hearing once in a while, but Chris is the standout.
B000002KLZ|5.0|Fleetwood Mac included three new tracks on this live album, and <br />all of them are brilliant!  Fireflies is one of the best Stevie <br />Nicks tunes she ever recorded, believe it or not.  Great melody <br />and perfect vocal.  Strangely, this track got buried and was <br />never played on the radio.  They also buried another of her best tunes, <br />Silver Springs for 20 years, very strange! There was saturation of Fleetwood Mac <br />in 1980, which may explain why Fireflies wasn't a hit. <br />They should have re-released this one later, or included it on <br />a compilation. <br /> <br />Christine McVie's new tune, One More Night is fantastic, and also <br />could easily have been a hit record.  Very pretty, soft tune. <br /> <br />Fleetwood Mac rival the Beach Boys with their incredible harmonies <br />on The Farmer's Daughter.  This is a big surprise and beautiful way <br />to close the record.   <br /> <br />The rest of the live recordings are interesting, but the real treasure <br />are the new tracks, don't miss them if you are a Fleetwood Mac <br />fan! It's a shame they got lost in the shuffle, so long ago...

I guess I'm a glutton for punishment, I give it 4 stars but I have no idea why. <br /> <br />At least I got some good lines from the movie that I use in everyday life such as \\"Gimme some sugar baby\\" and \\"Hail to the king baby\\". <br /> <br />
B000EWBKLC|4.0|I have just watched this movie for the first time and it is, as well, the first time I have watched a blu-ray movie. I am using a Sony XBR3 46', Samsung BD P1000 Blu-Ray Player, Harmon Kardon AVR 745(in video bypass mode for 1080p)and Mirage 5.1 Omni Speakers with 2 Klipsch Surrounds for 7.1. I say all of that so you can compare your configuration with mine. I would say that the video quality is better and anyone who says that it is not is just being negative. I understand this negativity because honestly if you own Saw on DVD, I do not, I would guess that it looks nearly as good especially 1080i with Faroudja. However I have to say that the sound difference was stunning. I may be alone on this but I am as much a sound guy as I am a video guy and the uncompressed PCM in 7.1 was insane. I turned the volume nearly off and it still was unbelievable. I am no techno whiz but I would suspect that original DVDs have a more severe compression on the audio than on the video and once both are uncompressed, although there are great improvements in both the audio really stands out.
0316172324|3.0|How can a few experts tell in a blink of a second that a sculpture is a fake when all of the scientific tests say it is authentic? <br /> <br />What is examined in this book is the minds ability to make snap decisions with the barest amount of information and often doing much better than people with unlimited time and information. <br /> <br />I have to say that this book is very interesting and actually reflects my personality.  The longer I have to think about something the more liekly I will get it wrong.  I was trained as an infantry sergeant which requires snap decisions but I have been this way my whole life. <br /> <br />On the whole this book was a good read and I recommend it to others but I remember thinking the whole time I was reading it that all of the examples were anecdotal.  I can find enough anecdotal evidence to support just about anything no matter how ridiculous.  The books major failing is its ability to show any hard data to support its suppositions. <br /> <br />Read it but don't take it too seriously
B000002AH7|5.0|This is a nice disc to listen to after a long day doing just about anything. It is just that soul-reaching and calming. I feel like this CD is a slice of jazz wrapped in a blanket of Mediterranean sunshine. No vocals are needed thanks to the melodic tunes of Miles' horn.
0823016714|4.0|If you are having trouble understanding physiognomy this is the book for you. This books has multiple subjects viewed from not only the head on, profile, three quarters, and back view, but also technically dynamic angles and a range of expressions that range from the mundane to the sometimes strained/ laughable expresions. the \\"Facial Expression\\" book varies between male and female, young (21) and old (78), and someone who is portly vs. someone who is thin. My only qualm with this book, the reason why it's four stars instead of five, is in how it addresses race. Of the 48 participants I'd say roughly 8 are non-white, it's a guesstimate because the pictures are black and white, so some people people appear to be non-white when in actuallity they just have a tan or are red in the face. While you truly don't need people from different races to show the range of facial expressions it couldn't hurt. If they at least had a non-white or two in the +50 age range it wouldn't bother me so much, but they don't, and I believe that people from different races ages differently (some people might get more pronounced jowls, deeper wrinkles, sun spots, thinning out of hair, etc.) <br /> <br />Besides that it's a good buy.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This is a hilariously written and acted film about two young people who get carried away with the beauty of an old house only to find that it is SERIOUSLY flawed.  Tom Hanks and Shelly Long are fantastic and people who love old houses will really identify with this.
1592401791|5.0|For fans of Beatles lore, Here There and Everywhere by Geoff Emerick is a thoroughly enjoyable read. I thought a book written by a former EMI sound engineer who worked on many Beatles albums would be a challenge. After all, how well could someone write who has worked at a mixing board most of his life? But I was pleasantly surprised. Primarily because Emerick had a very competent writer help him in his literary endeavor. Emerick was fortunate enough to be at the Beatles very first recording session and their last. His first day at work at the pimply age of 16 happened to coincide with the Fab Four's recording of-How Do You Do It-a song which they didn't write and refused to make their own. Emerick has the unique point-of-view that only a lowly-nobody can have. Considering his long friendship with Paul McCartney, his assessments of events and problems within the group seem candidly fair. Emerick was the main engineer for the albums: Revolver, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour, part of the White Album, and Abby Road. Quite revealing, for me anyway, was how much the Beatles interest in new sounds were accomodated by Emerick and not producer George Martin. For the most part, Martin left Emerick to figure out how to fill Beatle requests for unorthodox and sometimes whacky sounds. I highly recommend this book!
B000H305U0|2.0|Okay, that might be a teeny bit mean of me to say. Not all of Justin's stuff is bad.

This is one of the most annoying pop hits I've ever heard.<br /><br />People tell me it's a lot of fun to dance to, but personally I'd have to be really really really drunk to enjoy dancing to it.
0060987464|5.0|This book was extremely fascinating.  It really brings to life the transformation of Brian Warner to Marilyn Manson.  It shows events in his childhood that helped to shape him into the person he is.  With first person memories, he describes his childhood and the impact music played on his ambitions and goals.<br /><br />The book goes on to talk about the formation of his band and how the members met, discussing problems with band members and how the band had lofty goals that seemed unreachable.  Later, opening for Nine Inch Nails, he became friends with Trent Rezner and later came to know Anton LaVey, both of whom had great influence on his life.  Manson talks about how his rise to Superstar status changed his view on drugs, sex, other life aspects.  He explains how he took on the the name Marilyn Manson permanently, stating that at a certain moment he realized Brian Warner was dying and Marilyn Manson was being born.<br /><br />Throughout the book there are moments where Manson remembers where he was when he came up with ideas for some of his songs including his version of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"The Beautiful People\\".  The book also covers some of his own philosophies about love, homosexuality, and life.<br /><br />The book is beautifully constructed with photos and artwork which help with the understanding of what he is discussing.  The book goes into great detail, allowing the reader to really understand why Marilyn Manson is the way he is.  A fantastic read that, I believe, fans and non-fans would enjoy.

Great script, great direction, etc. Yeah, it's a little on the quirky side, but it's a clever and very entertaining kind of quirky.<br /><br />Plus, the cast in this is also very good. I've liked Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon ever since they were in the Mouseketeers together.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|SAW III goes for the jugular, and it succeeds in being repulsively fascinating in its expectedly perverse manner.  The most disturbing scene is not one of Jigsaw's many games, though---it's the operation performed on his brain to remove a piece of his skull to prevent him from dying.  It's pretty gruesome to say the least.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, the writers seem to be trying to turn Jigsaw into some kind of mercy-seeking angel, trying to somehow justify his horrifying acts.  Sorry, folks...Jigsaw is pure evil, sociopathically immoral, and immune to the immense acts of torture he orchestrates with the assistance of his demented slave, well played by Shawnee Smith.  Tobin Bell is effective as Jigsaw, considering most of his time is spent in a hospital bed.  There are some horrifying acts of sadistic torture, and some good acting from Angus Macfayden as the man whose revenge leads him down a fatal path.  Bahar Soomekh is also effective as the doctor recruited to perform the operation on Jigsaw, or die herself.  Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyers return from SAW II, but they are merely torture objects in this one.<br /><br />SAW has had its moments, but the trilogy should stop now; it's focusing more on gore and shock than storylines, and even though you wouldn't think so, it does leave a door open for another sequel.  Do us a favor...stop while you're reasonably ahead.

0875428940|3.0|This deck is often famed for it's attention to the minor arcana's art, its use of pagan symbology, and being a faithful follower to the Rider-Waite style. As a purely divination deck- it fulfills all expectations of performance. The stock of the cards is good, and their size perfect for use and laying out. <br /> <br />However, I find myself highly underwhelmed. The minor arcana art is indeed fantastic- and I can see why they talk about it so heavily after the utter boredom that was the major arcana. I am no stranger to nudity in Tarot and think little enough when it's done tastefully...there were points this deck was pushing the tasteful bar among the major arcana. Nor was the art particuarly impressive to me in the major, as noted. They brag that the minor arcana were not an afterthought- I can agree. This time it looks like the major arcana were. <br /> <br />To the claims of pagan symbolism I agree the deck mostly adheres to this- yet I find some of the symbol choices oddly placed: Such as a male angel-style figure on the Temperance card (a card largely noted as being 'feminine' to balance the oft-masculine Chariot) and the use of a Phoenix on a card that remains as Judgement...a symbol and a card that have very little in common. The less often seen Rebirth or Rejuvenation would have been a better fit to my mind, though I freely admit this is solely my opinion. <br /> <br />My gripe regarding the magician holding eternity (the Loop) rather than being crowned by it and leaving the wand among the other symbols is one not exclusive to this deck sadly. It's just being mentioned as I took the time to mention the other issues I had with other cards in this deck. <br /> <br />However, as many have said- the minor arcana are indeed fantastic. The deck is worth seeing if only to behold the works of art that are these 56 cards. It's just a tragedy the majority of the intial 22 are not so wonderous. My sole exception to that is the Fool. So it's not a bad buy- it's a realdivination deck- but don't buy into all the artistic and symbolic hype.
0399143793|5.0|Contrary to what many reader's believe Lee Child is British, but moved with his family from Cumbria to the United States to begin a new career as an American thriller writer. What probably fools a lot of people is that is rare for a British author to be able to write American thrillers with any kind of authenticity. He has won a number of awards with his books and he lives just outside New York City with his American wife Jane. The couple have a grown-up daughter, Ruth and when Lee is not writing he shares his time between music, reader and supporting the New York Yankees. <br /> <br />Jack Reacher is a footloose and fancy free former army cop out for a stroll in the Chicago sunshine. He sees an elegant and attractive young woman stuggling on crutches. He stops to offer assistance with a steadying arm and then turns around to see a handgun aimed straight at his stomach. <br /> <br />Locked in the back of a dark van and chained to a woman, Reacher begins to regret his gallant offer of help to the young woman who claims to be an FBI agent. She certainly seems tough enough to be one, but the kidnappers are saying nothing. When they get to their destination, what is going to be the outcome. The odds are certainly stacked against the pair of them and can Reacher rely on the woman to reciprocate his earlier offer of help.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Most Madonna fans were disappointed when the full-length Reinvention Tour failed to show up on DVD (and we're still waiting).  But M has provided her fans with what is perhaps the best DVD release of her career so far(we're also waiting for the Virgin Tour, Blond Ambition, and a video anthology).  From the stunning cinematography, sharp editing, and of course, the sensational music, \\"Confessions\\" proves once again Madonna is at the top of her game.   <br /> <br />Although \\"Confessions\\" is a larger-than-life production, Madonna is ultimately the centre of attention; the woman has incredible stage presence.  Her singing is stronger than ever, and you will be amazed to see how this 48-year-old woman can dance and keep up with dancers half her age.  <br /> <br />While the show is heavily devoted to her \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" album, you will be entertained by each song.  In fact, some of the \\"Confessions\\" songs come off better on stage than on record, particularly \\"Isaac\\" and \\"Let It Will Be\\", which, on record, are listenable but not repeat-worthy like \\"Hung Up\\" or \\"Sorry\\", but here  <br />on stage, they sizzle. It's also fun to hear classics such as \\"Like A Virgin\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\" remixed.  And the new version of \\"Erotica\\" is fabulous.  <br /> <br />The CD version is a head-scratcher.  I don't understand why we get the \\"Confessions\\" interlude but no \\"Live To Tell\\", which it precedes. And it would have been nice to get one of the ballads from the show.  <br /> <br />But, otherwise this is a fantastic combo set.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|Vice President Al Gore and director Davis Guggenheim have teamed up together to provide a compelling presentation.  Using charts and statistics with the simple, effective skills President Reagan used, Al Gore goes through diagnosing, sampling, then convincing us of the existence of global warming.  Having been no stranger to the topic for decades, he demonstrates stunning global pictures that document its effects upon the entire global landscape.  Beautiful cinematography and quiet evocative music garnish his presentation that is poignantly laced with autobiographical narratives of key moments of his life.  Also, he interrupts his lecture to tell some funny jokes to keep the electricity of the audience flowing.  The former Vice President takes his composite picture and evidence, and, then he asserts that it is a moral, not a political imperative that we reverse these trends with a myriad of CO2 reducing porposals.  He also, like a skillful debater, surfaces the rebuttals by the opposition and offers his own counterpoints.  (For instance, he honestly shows that C02 levels go in cycles over a long history even before scientists obtained the means to measure it, but one of his most eye-opening statistic is that C02 levels have never been 300 parts per million until now.  No cycle has ever looked as C02 saturated as long or as hugely as the time in which we now live.)    This documentary should be seen by everyone, especially the skeptics.  Most of the people who comment about the movie were already convinced of global warming, but that isn't to say there's no wisdom in firing up the troups.  Global warming is such a divisive issue, and the ramifications are so important that, even those who believe that global warming is a hoax or that it is real, but a natural cycle, need to know what they're debating.  It is always illuminating to know more about what you believe, but it's also important for the general public to get a hearing about a major issue.      There were a couple of minor weaknesses.  First of all, Vice President Al Gore is a politician.  Most commentators say this isn't a political DVD.  Not true.  To the liberals, I say, it is political.  To the conservatives, I say, who cares?  In the middle of the DVD, the movie shows the 2000 Presidential race debacle.  This happens a long time after the Vice President makes the point that the Bush Administration has abandoned its promises about the environment.  The context of film clips of the election is political.  Convincing the public of global warming is a political debate.  Al Gore does a great job, but I thought the brief lapse with the 2000 election detracted from his message briefly.  Secondly, and also minor, his charts show that global warming has brought about an increase of new species.  (Shouldn't we be frightened if the changes didn't?  Afterall, where would we be if that didn't happen with the climate changes that wiped out the dinosaurs?)  He then adds that trees have been devastated by growing species of beetles.  (Maybe new, sturdier trees will evolve.  Of course moral presumption in environmental matters isn't prudent, either.)    One of the best arguments he makes is about money.  He shows how little dissent there is among scientists, except those paid by corporations, like oil companies.  One of his best analogies is when he shows that there were ads after the surgeon general's claims about smoking, which read, \\"More doctors smoke Camels than any other brand.\\"  Such is the opposition now to global warming.      Is Al Gore cherry picking highlights or an environmental Henny Penny?  The results are too important not to be focused and find out for ourselves.  Everyone should see this movie.
B000HEWEEE|1.0|I'm surprised at the stellar reviews for this movie.  It has all the peppy pacing and snappy ambiance of a funeral dirge.  Both Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves must have done something to annoy the cameraman, because I have never seen them look so utterly unattractive. The dialogue is stilted and trite, and its delivery is usually in monotones.  The closest these two could ever come to generating electricity is by briskly rubbing their stockinged feet over a synthetic rug on a really cold dry day.  I was so hoping to like the movie, because I thought the premise was interesting.  By the end of the movie, I was so disappointed in the director, actors, scriptwriters, and the sappy music that I was compelled to write this review.  Don't buy - rent.  Even then you'll find it a frustrating waste of time.
B000002NIW|5.0|There was a time when I regarded The Deftones sophomore album as their weakest link, but after another listen I began to realize that it very well may be their strongest.  Mixing almost to perfection everything that made `Adrenaline' so pulse pounding and everything that made `White Pony' so revolutionary; `Around the Fur' is the perfect transitional piece to show where a brilliant band was headed, musically and emotionally.  Starting things off with the infectious `My Own Summer' and ending things with the strangely inviting `MX'; `Around the Fur' is close to perfection. <br /> <br />`My Own Summer' starts things off brilliantly.  It sports a great riff, fun to listen to and even more fun to play.  Chino's vocals are great and his screaming is just infectious (I actually have this song as my cell phone ring tone).  This was one of the first Deftones songs I ever heard.  It graced `The Matrix' soundtrack and proved to be the best reason to own the soundtrack in the first place.  Brilliant way to start an album.  Grabs you immediately and keeps you clenched in their claws. <br /> <br />`Lhabia' is another brutal track but the next surprise comes in the form of `Mascara' which is much slower, eerier and at times somewhat disturbing.  Some have noted this may be about an abusive relationship, and I can see that here.  It's beautiful in it's oddity for it's not a song you'd expect from this band, but it's a welcome addition to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />`Around the Fur', the title track to this album, is everything you'd want in a Deftones song.  It starts off with some great drum work and then fills out much the way of `My Own Summer', commanding and infectious, a song you can sing along with and get completely stuck in your head.  My old band used to play this song a lot because it's diverse yet not too complex.  It's not standard so it's interesting, yet it's not too complicated to where you get lost figuring it out.  Chino's lyrics are great here; different and thought provoking...the best thing about this band is Chino's genius. <br /> <br />`Rickets' is again, brutal.  `Be Quite and Drive' on the other hand is not so brutal.  Some have regarded it as the best song The Deftones have released but I strongly disagree.  `Passenger' was far better (still my all time favorite Deftones song).  I actually hated this song when I first heard it.  I wasn't impressed, but the more I listen to it the more it grows on me.  I actually really enjoy it now...but that took a while. <br /> <br />`Lotion' is straight Deftones, a track that could have passed for `Adrenaline'.  Chino sounds furious throughout this song, and when he chants \\"I feel sick\\" you just know they nailed this song, they got it right.  One of the things they do VERY right is `Dai the Flu' a song that stands alone as the best track on `Around the Fur'.  It's eerie to a degree and completely contagious, a song that's unlike any other they've done.  Chino's vocals are impressive, soft and delicate not to mention strong and determined.   <br /> <br />`Headup' has Chino trading lines with Max Cavalera from Soulfly.  It's brutal, intense and proof that the ONLY band that should even attempt the whole rap/rock thing is The Deftones.  They just get it right.  The closing track `MX' features almost a conversation type verse between Chino and a woman.  It's a very different kind of song, but it's very well done and makes you want to listen to it over and over.  A great way to close out an album.  So, in closing...this is a fantastic contribution to the brilliance that is The Deftones and will look and sound pretty good in any CD collection!
B000083E79|5.0|An amazing span of work. Cher truly knew how to reinvent herself over the decades and come out with a winning hit that would have next generations of fans listening to her songs. Way to go Cher! I like all of the songs on this cd.
B000002J6H|5.0|I write this in the winter, with just a bit of snow on the ground.  And when it gets like this outside, when the air is crisp and biting but the sun is shining, I can't help but hark back to one of my very favorite albums of all time, Stephen Stills's first solo effort.  Back in 1970, Steve Stills was beautiful.  And those sideburns!  I was in love.  And I played that album over and over again and I stared at the cover.  And I dreamed of sitting by him in the snow, with the giraffe, and listening to him play.  It wasn't until I got older and got the CD, and didn't have to flip the record over to hear the second side, that I truly appreciated the musicianship on this album.  I think this is one of the finest rock-blues albums ever recorded.  His pals who played on it with him were the stars of the time, and none of them had their names above the title.  And while I don't think that Stills ever surpassed his effort on this album, I do think that muscially, he was the star of CSN&Y.  I like Neil Young, but even listening to one of my favorites of his, After the Gold Rush, the differences in melody and musical skill are startling.  \\"Stephen Stills\\" resonates strongest for those of us for whom this had meaning over 35 years ago (gulp!), but the music is still powerful today.  It is a truly great album from a truly accomplished musician.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I enjoy all of the songs on this album and think that India Arie is the greatest! Her voice is beautiful, strong and powerful. Every song on this album is just as great as the previous song! Her songs aren't flashy, but down to earth. I think India Arie will be around a long time as a singer!
B000957O82|4.0|Displaying that he can handle the lead role in a romantic comedy just as easily as he can handle every other genre in the field, Will Smith shines in HITCH as Alex Hitchens, aka \\"The Date Doctor.\\"  Hitch helps average guys gain the attention and win the hearts of the women of their dreams.  He has a strict code that he follows and his identity has remained a secret.<br /><br />Hitch is hired by a tax accountant named Albert (Kevin James).  Albert is an overweight, average-Joe who happens to work at a firm that handles starlet Allegra Cole's (Amber Valleta) accounts.  Allegra Cole is a celebrity and has all the money, fame, power, and beauty that comes with her station.  Albert falls deeply in love with Ms. Cole and needs help getting her attention.  This is a romantic comedy, so even the most improbable scenarios become likely and soon Albert finds himself dating the famous Allegra Cole.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Hitch has some problems of his own.  He's fallen for a national gossip columnist, Sara (Eva Mendes) who is trying to figure out who the unknown man Allegra Cole has been seen with really is.  Hitch is a true genius at setting up scenarios for his clients, but all of the tricks he uses to help his clients have the opposite effect when he uses them with Sara.  For example, A romantic trip to Ellis Island turns Sara into a raging and crying fury of hatred and a night at a make-your-own seafood place has Hitch breaking out in a serious facial reaction.  As Hitch and Sara bond with each other, their relationship becomes increasingly rocky when a spurned client turns on Hitch and Sara learns what he really does for a living.<br /><br />The poster and DVD cover for HITCH say that \\"Will Smith is `Hitch'\\".  There's no better way to explain it because Smith is Hitch.  Every gesture, move, and spoken phrase seems perfect.  Hitch is a role that Smith was born to play.  But Smith doesn't shine alone in the film.  Eva Mendes is a beautiful woman, but she's also incredibly talented.  She holds her own against one of Hollywood's most powerful actors.  From various interviews she has given, Mendes seems like a down-to-Earth person.  That reality grounds Sara and radiates through her and makes her someone that the audience cares for.  Kevin James does an excellent job as the film's pivotal-plot character Albert and in many scenes upstages Smith.<br /><br />I tend to like most genres of movies as long as there is a good story involved.  However, romantic comedies are my least favorite film genre.  Many romantic comedies made are trite and have no originality to them.  HITCH really isn't like that.  The movie has a good story, great actors, and solid direction.  It's both funny and tender.  Unlike many movies in he genre, HITCH is a movie that a person can enjoy watching by themselves just as much as watching it with a loved one.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of romantic comedies, fans of Will Smith, fans of Eva Mendes, and fans of Kevin James.  For movie trivia fans, the fire station shown at the beginning of the movie as Hitch is helping a client is the same firehouse used in GHOSTBUSTERS.bly talented.

0385751060|5.0|This novel is soooooo wonderful! Sparse, but so layered with complexity (even though that sounds like an oxymoron), Boyne writes of the holocaust from the eyes of a young boy. Bruno doesn't understand why he and his family had to leave their warm, safe cozy home in Berlin to follow his father's job and settle at \\"Out-With\\". Bruno's new home is just yards from the fence that contains one of the most horrifying concentration camps on record. And even though Bruno doesn't understand what his father's job is (only that he is much praised by \\"The Fury\\"), he knows that \\"Out-With\\" is not a safe or happy place. And he wonders about all the people he sees over the fence who are wearing grey striped pajamas. Eventually his adventurous spirit overrides his parents' orders to stay away from the fence and he goes exploring. At the fence edge he meets a boy his exact age (a deftly written \\"mirror image\\" of Bruno). The boys develop a friendship and through this friendship, Boyne illustrates how easily the tables could be turned. It just as easily could be Bruno fenced in. The holocaust is hard for adult minds to grasp, and it is exponentially more so for a child's. In the stunning denoument, Boyne illustrates so clearly how difficult it is to distinguish one person from another once the labels have been removed.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone!
B0002RGNRU|5.0|Five stars it not enough for this movie... <br /> <br />This truly is the best film for a loong time, without a doubt. <br />If you haven't seen it yet, get to it ASAP. It's a gem. <br />What's it about? It's about memories for sure, and what (not) to do with them. First time i saw this film I instantly pressed play again, not because I didn't \\"get it\\", but because I really bought this original idea and wanted to see it again. And then I bought it, and I have pressed Play many a time since.  <br /> <br />What? Still here?  <br />Go rent or buy it. Now. <br />

0446677450|4.0|In 2001, This one book changed my way of thinking about running a small business.  Wrapped around a series of short stories of Robert Kiyosaki learning how to think like a big businessman, I started to think like a big businessman.  Since then, I have started five businesses, and have sold two of them off, shut two of them down without suffering any loss, and am parlaying my profits into a business that should be regional, if not national in a few more years.  Thanks, Robert.<br /><br />This book is the foundation for it all.  Yes, it is vague, because your way is different from mine. The vagueness still provides you with the concepts you will need to think beyond the level most of us (myself included) think a small business should run.  It allows you to take your current business (or carreer, or investments) and think about what you could do to make the business bigger, better, and uniqely yours.<br /><br />Read it, and enjoy it.  It's light, fun and insightful.  You may disagree with parts, but if you think about it long enough, you will see Robert is right on.
B000KGGLCU|2.0|I would think the hardest working Pop star would employ a better production team to compile such a wonderful concert. The DVD extras are piss poor. The camera quality and slow-mo matrix like effects throughout are overused and very 90's. Being the Tour was international and played countries that haven't seen her in years it would have been smart to incorporate some of that footage or fan footage if any was even taken. This DVD doesn't do the concert any justice Live. What a waste of money.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I purchased this light for my son to use with his D40. This little light works great. TTL is almost right on without using the exposure compensation. In my opinion, a shoe mount flash makes a huge difference in light quality. The actual light swivels up so that you can bounce the light off the ceiling. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that it can not swivel side to side. Therefore you can not bounce off a side wall. For the price and the difference this light will make in your photos, I highly reccommend the sb-400.     Karen
B00006SFLV|5.0|This remains the one truly great and overlooked television creation of the 1990s. The ensemble acting, storytelling skills, production values, and emotional substance are as compelling for me now as when I first saw this series in 1995. That persistence, after what must now be ten viewings of each episode, is unique for me, as for thousands of others.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it didn't get a chance to be thus adopted by millions of others, when this first aired, and that (along with ABC's well-documented corporate cowardice) is why it didn't continue for even a full 24-to-26-episode season.<br /><br />I won't repeat the descriptive (and accurate) points brought out well by many of the other customers. I'll note here one crucial aspect that is often under-mentioned: \\"MSCL\\" is not solely about the teenagers. It revolves around a group of friends of that age. Yet it puts the stories firmly in the settings of their families and their teachers, as well. One knows the context and hidden facets for all the characters' lives, even within only 900 minutes.<br /><br />This came from both serendipity and law. Claire Danes (Angela) and Devon Gummersall (Brian), portraying the two central threads of characterization, were 14 to 15 when this was made, and had strong legal restrictions on their work hours. That meant more scenes had to be written or rewritten to highlight and deepen their characters' friends. All of them were portrayed by actors with more liberal hours, but who were still all teenagers, rare both then and now.<br /><br />Most of all, it meant that the adults had to have substantial screen time. It shows most of all in the emotional dimensions opened up for, and by, Bess Armstrong (Patty Chase) and Tom Irwin (Graham Chase). That broadened scope is one of the strongest reasons why this series still resonates, especially for many in our 30s and 40s, when any number of sitcoms and formula dramas using pre-fab parental stereotypes have faded from cultural memory.<br /><br />The video quality of these discs is immaculate.

B000H30B2C|4.0|Peter Jackson's King Kong is pure entertainment (so cliche, I know) but a viewer must to know how much doses of it can handle. I've never complained about the amount of spectacle the director put into the movie but only in the running time in it. The writers were some kind of iresponsable I think. Some characters were developed in a rough way, not all of them but some of the actors were wasted. Clear ideas! Clear ideas! not script changes while filming. But what can I say? I liked after all.

0446691437|2.0|Steven Pressfield is clearly experienced in the \\"war of art\\".  In many parts of this book, he hits the nail on the head and describes \\"Resistance\\" (his dark personification of procrastination etc.) in vivid detail.  I'm sure many readers will identify intimately with the topics touched upon. <br /> <br />The book is divided into three parts, describing things that inhibit us from being creative, how to overcome them and, finally, those things that inspire us.  The first section is well written, although overly verbose -- I think one could almost read the chapter headings and be done with it.  Nonetheless, he certainly touches on a couple of very important points.  From there onward, the book begins to deteriorate steadily.  The second section is bearable (it even has a few gems here and there), but the third falters completely in my opinion, and in many words says very little (even managing to fall flat around the very interesting dream of Largo). <br /> <br />It's a pity, since I think this book could have been great.  As it stands, it is not.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|This was too funny! Kid's beauty pageants are scary places indeed and all the way through the movie, I expected Olive to be just roasted at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.<br /><br />As this band of related misfits journeys across the country, everyone else has their turn in the disfunctional spotlight.  The slightly chubby, bespectacled, un-beauty that is Olive is expected to win the contest and thus lift this most-depressing band of folks from their darkest despair.<br /><br />The casting for this movie was spot on.  Everyone does a  great job at playing his or her own miserable part.  Kinnear is perfect as a financially stressed motivational speaker/dad and Toni Collette is excellent as the end-of-her-rope, long-suffering wife.  Alan Arkin's grandfather is too funny (don't watch with little kids around--he cusses like three sailors.)  And, Abigail Breslin (Olive) has a long future in the movie business. It is great to see a child star who can pull off a character such as this with a straight face.<br /><br />Watch the movie! If you don't see your own family in them, you'll definitely see your neighbors.

You can get it at Best Buy for 15 bucks, that's not overpriced, that reasonable.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|The ARTISTS in this recording and film project by Kenny and Jerry Harrison(talking heads) make this project what it is. Kenny Wayne Shepherd is a young and amazing guitar player who has a good head on his shoulders musically. But it is the \\"old-timers\\" who put the stamp on this one. It is all about them, and that is the beauty of this release. Kenny, respectfully lets them have their own run. He plays with them, but doesn't try to compete or overshadow them. Respectfully and tastefully done.  To fully get the overall beauty and majesty of this project, I recommend watching the DVD first. It tells the whole story of the project with plenty of conversations with these Blues players who have never stopped playing the Blues. To them its statement is ever present and not forgotten. By watching this truly captivating film(which is truly one of the best documentaries I have ever viewed)it will help you to truly appreciate these songs again and again.  \\"Potato Patch\\", \\"Spoonful George\\" &\\"Tina Marie\\" are standouts, but only slightly edge over the others. Trust me the entire disc selection is amazing and wonderfully done.  All in all, this is one to have and treasure. It is a tasteful, respectful and well done homage to the players performing on this project. I have gained a new respect for all these players through their advice and stories, but also for Kenny Wayne Shepherd. HATS OFF TO ALL INVOLVED ON THIS PROJECT. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008MLSH|4.0|Anna Netrebko has rapidly become a first tier star in opera.  This album, her first at DGG, illustrates why some rate her so highly; it also illustrates some of the questions that some have raised about her.  All in all, though, a very nice CD.<br /><br />A few selections illustrate:<br /><br />Mozart, Idomeneo, \\"Quando avran fine omai.\\"  She displays a rich and clean voice.  There is a very attractive quality to her voice manifest in this work.<br /><br />Mozart, Don Giovanni, \\"Crudele? Ah no, mio bene!...Non mi dir.\\"  This is Donna Anna's poignant aria, given her circumstances.  Netrebko displays rich tones.  This is a well sung cut.  \\"Non mi dir\\" shows off some agility in her voice.<br /><br />Donizetti, Lucia di Lammermoor.  \\"Ancor non giunse!. . .Regnava nel silenzio. . .Quando rapito in estasi\\"  Something of a disappointment.  Coloratura is not her forte (and see her \\"Sempre Libera\\" CD for further confirmation).  She clearly shows off a rich and lush voice.  I think that she displays some characterization here that is compelling.  She hits high notes cleanly.  But her ornamentation is indifferent, and she appears unable to trill.  I know, some say that that is irrelevant. But compare Beverly Sills' version of this work, with almost too many trills extraordinarily well sung and her florid technique, and this version simply pales.<br /><br />Bellini, La Sonnambula.  \\"Care compagna. . .Come per me sereno.\\"  Again, Netrebko displays a rich voice.  She displays an agile voice and the ability to hit the high notes.  Her rendition of \\"come per sereno\\" is spirited.<br /><br />Gounod, Faust. \\"The Jewel Song.\\" Very smooth singing; animated singing.  But the technique does not measure up to Anna Moffo's version--let alone Joan Sutherland's.<br /><br />Puccini, La Boheme.  \\"Musetta's Waltz.\\"  Yikes!  What a version.  Brava Netrebko.  Her darker voice is very well suited to this.  The characterization of Musetta seems on the mark.  A wonderful cut.<br /><br />All in all, this shows the promise of Netrebko.  It also indicates where her strengths are and where she does not do so well (coloratura work).  However, this is a very nice introduction to her work and her art./>All in all, this shows the promise of Netrebko.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|I didn't think it was possible for them to improve on their original Celtic Woman concert but I was wrong. I have had this video for two days and have watched it four times so far. It's too bad the rating system only goes up to 5 stars because this video would definitely be close to 10. I have ordered another copy just in case the original gets damaged.
B0000714BP|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie!  Not just because it is so fun, and Wesley got all the really great lines, but because, if you pay attention to what this movie is saying about the characters, you see it in a whole new light.  The movie can be empowering, funny, touching, and/or intense, depending on your perspective. An abused woman finds a friend in a most unlikely individual. Knowing full-well \\"she\\" was really a man, and yet she allowed a friendship to grow. Cool! An old woman in a dinky tiny town, who had given up on life, found friendship in the tallest, muscle bound, gentile black woman (Wesley Snipes), that she had ever seen (or ever would). If you think about each and every character in the small town, you realize what those three drag queens symbolically brought and left with them. What about the young man who stutters and then finds release in a gift from Miss Vita. I think everyone should watch this movie 10 times from the perspective of each major character! Enjoy!
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I can't give this CD less than four stars because the songwriting and musicianship are obviously of extremely high quality. Having said that, the new arrangements, for the most part, aren't that different than they were originally. There are a few moments that are interesting, but usually the effect wears off after a few listens. Some songs, like Something, for example, probably sound better only because they are remastered and teh original albums are currently not available in that form. Two tracks in my opinion in which the new arrangements are different enough to really catch your attention are Get Back and the Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite!/I Want You (She's So Heavy)/Helter Skelter medly (for the ending mostly).
B000683VI4|4.0|A great movie. Very well done, but could follow the story line more instead of going back and forth in time.

B000KQGP2G|5.0|First of all, THIS IS PART II of the Perfect Element concept:<br /><br />1) Daniel states in an interview given at the morow website:<br /><br />\\"Conceptually it is the followup to 'The Perfect Element Part One' so to kind of end all of these discussions that have been flourishing on the internet in different forms -  the answer is positive - yes it is the second part of the perfect element, but we have had...like...we have kind of tried to hidden it as much as possible because we don't want people to buy 'Scarsick' because it is the second part of the perfect element...\\"<br /><br />2) The band's news section of their website states:<br /><br />\\"the many fans who spent weeks and weeks discussing the possibility of this album being The Perfect Element Part II were finally able to say \\"What did I tell you\\" when the official copies reached the stores, ending a long wait and putting an end to the obligatory interview question \\"When will TPE2 come?\\" (or rather just replacing it with \\"When will TPE3 come?\\"). \\"<br /><br />3) Notice that the inside of the CD case says 'the perfect element, part II - \\"he\\"' - the  first words in the insert read 'part II' and the end of the booklet reads \\"to be continued\\"!!!<br /><br />So now we can all wait for The Perfect Element III!<br /><br />NOW ONTO THE REVIEW OF THE ALBUM:<br /><br />Musically, TPEI seemed to follow a very cohesive (yet amazingly complex and diverse) sound throughout the album - highlighted mostly by epic sounding guitar and keyboard melodies. 'Scarsick' on the other hand is a completely different sounding album...<br /><br />\\"Scarsick\\" - the opening track, has the similar rap-technique that Daniel utilized on the opening track of TPEI 'Used'. The 'rapping' is nothing he hasn't done before, and is obvious evidence of Mike Patton's (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle) influence on his vocal experimentation. The main guitar riff in the song is crunching and groovy, backed by some awesome Brazilian sounding bass and strings. The chorus is a beautiful display of Daniel's higher and mellower vocal abilities. Altogether one of the highlights on the whole album.<br /><br />\\"Spitfall\\" is very wordy and is another song largely using 'rapping' throughout - the chorus kind of generic - possibly the worst song on the album but still good and very interesting nonetheless. 'Yo'.<br /><br />\\"Cribcaged\\" is a mellower tune with very catchy melodies accompanied by some explicit words of aggression which may be a little overdone. Beautiful piano and acoustic guitar work along with higher background vocal harmonies.<br /><br />\\"America\\" has stirred up some controversy because of the content of the lyrics. Daniel explains some of it in the morow website interview - basically the aggression is towards the American government, and his personal critique does come through in the concept, however he does ask the American people \\"If I say I love you, dare you love me too?\\". The satyrical content of the song can and has been expressed by many other AMERICAN bands! Musically the song is not that appealing to me, but does fit the concept quite well - very funky and different, mixing in different elements of American pop-culture to create the desired mood of the song.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Lyrically remember that THIS IS A CONCEPT ALBUM, therefore does have a story it is trying to tell. The same statement that Daniel made in the insert of TPEI would also apply to Scarsick:<br /><br />\\"Even though parts of this concept and its emotions are influenced by our lives and others' we want to emphasise that it should not be seen as an autobiography or true story. However, we hope and believe that anybody with the ability to feel pity and empathy should be able to relate to this story and recognise themselves throughout the album. If not in the situations then at least in the spectra of emotions displayed through them.\\"<br /><br />\\"Disco Queen\\" has elements similar to the band Killers album 'Hot Fuss'. The song as a whole hasmore of an experimental than an actual 'disco' sound. I would compare it more to the efforts of Mr Bungle's self titled album. 'Disco Queen' is not the most complex song that POS has composed, but is definitely the most different from anything they have done before - that said, it is actually a very enjoyable song.<br /><br />\\"Kingdom of Loss\\" is a beautiful arrangement on the mellower side for the most part, yet filled with the angst of the character being displayed through Daniel's vocals during heavier moments. Conceptually the song shows the character reflecting on the world around him and seeing the depressed state of things whereas 'King of Loss' from TPEI saw the character's disappointment in his life and what was expected of him. It seems that his search for independence and a meaningful existence only leaves him disenchanted with society as a whole.<br /><br />\\"Mrs. Modern Mother Mary\\" is a sarcastic look at religion with distorted bending guitar riffs similar to Alice In Chain's sound, particularly the song 'Man in the Box'. Quite a dark but groovy song with a catchy chorus.<br /><br />\\"Idiocracy\\" probably sounds more similar to previous albums than any other song on 'Scarsick', a very atmospheric song employing many different instruments and sound techniques. Lyrically another song projecting frustration towards external institutions of society - see 'Idioglossia' from TPEI. Any older fan of POS should love this epic song.<br /><br />\\"Flame to the Moth\\" is the heaviest song on the album that sees Daniel using vocal methods he has not previously ventured out into before. The screaming he does (only in small portions of the song) is similar to the vocalist from the band Blindside. AWESOME SONG!!!<br /><br />\\"Enter Rain\\" is the 10 minute+ epic of the album. A Pink Floyd-like ambient sound with a POS twist and probably the most emotionally moving song on 'Scarsick' - the perfect song to finish the album.<br /><br />In conclusion, this album is great - perhaps not a masterpiece like previous efforts, but a 5 star album for sure. Don't expect it to sound anything like TPEI - just expect beautiful musicianship!!!<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: If you are just reading reviews to check out POS then you may want to begin your collection with 'One Hour By the Concrete Lake' instead of 'Scarsick'. If you are a fan of progressive rock that really does 'progress' then this album should suit your tastes. If you do like the diversity and experimentation on 'Scarsick' then you should definitely purchase Faith No More's 1992 album 'Angel Dust'.

B000HT3JNY|3.0|I may have rated this Blu-ray disc higher if it weren't for the downloadable trailer available through the PS3.  The trailer is perfect high definition, a reason to spend too much money on a good TV.  The colors are as bright and fresh as the image is detailed.  The closest I have yet seen to the 'looking through a window' effect.  Stunning, absolutely stunning.  So what a shock when I started watching the Blu-ray disc.  Don't get me wrong, it's good, very good, but not anywhere in the same league as the trailer.  I then watched a clip from the trailer and found the matching clip in the film; night and day.  The film has a slight haze of grain jumping pixels throughout, the trailer has none.  Colors are subdued, no, the colors are burnt and crushed in this film when compared to the trailer.  The whole movie was shot digitally so what happened.  If you like Click the Blu-ray disc is going to be better than the DVD, even the special features are in high definition.  But after seeing the trailer it's clear that someone dropped the ball in encoding this transfer.    (PS3 - 1080p projector - 92\\")
B00003CXP1|5.0|This is one of those movies that you almost get annoyed hearing about now cause it's so \\"cool,\\" but it deserves the acclaim it receives. For anyone interested in film, history or technique, this movie is required material. following up on PI, Aronofsky utilizes extremely heavy stylization that identifies his whole oeuvre. I won't bother with a synopsis, since you can find that elsewhere and that's not what the film is about anyway. In addition to actually pioneering new techniques in his films, including a camera actually mounted on the actor for reverse-POV shots, which i have subsequently seen used in other films. Few filmmakers can so poignantly convey the experience of a migraine headache as Mr. Aronofsky and watching the movie can be a draining experience, which is a testament to the director's skill since that was obviously his intention. It's also really cool just to look at.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This band is by far one of the most talented and creative I've ever heard, and its quite funny to hear people discussing them as a new phenomena. They've been making music for about a decade, this is nothing new, everything they produce is marvelous. If you like Plans, you really should try out their old stuff. Transatlanticism, the album released prior to this, is likely my favorite, though I can hardly call it worse than anything else they have released. The band's progression over time is nothing short of fantastic, and I am proud of their success. This album along with their other six that I own are what make me believe that this band will have continued success for years to come. Buy this cd if you like music, then buy the rest of them.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|The photography, costumes and dialogue are very well done in this most recent adaptation of Bronte's classic. Upon first viewing Mr. Rochester, I did not think he was good looking. His hair was askew, his demeanor demonstrative and authoratative...frankly I found him to be what he was supposed to be: harsh, angry and rude. When first seeing the quiet Miss Eyre, he is not beguiled or friendly, but instead shows his true colors as the tormented soul that he is. As with any good relationship worth waiting for; one with substance, the viewer slowly sees inside the bravado, sinical attitude and agitated angst that torments Mr. Rochester. The director allows us to see a more thorough interpretation of the characters that have enthralled many for so long.    In reference to the passion, one knows that a simple touch of the hand was seen as an intimate gesture during this time period. But in allowing us to view both Rochester's and Eyre's dance with each other, we have a more intimate portrayal of two people who have suffered and as all people that are drawn to each other, subject each other to games and eventually their inner most selves. One knows that a woman was viewed as secondary even with family wealth during the era that this story takes place. Therefore having to know one's place, yet with strength, move forward as a woman and handle the challenges that befall her, actress Ruth Wilson does a superb job of interpreting the epitomy of grace and sanity which has eluded Mr. Rochester in his search to be loved and to love.    Actor Toby Stevens only flaw would be that with his theatre background, he sometimes comes off as though he were playing to a packed house of thousands as some thespians who have a great deal of theatre training and background do. However, these are momentary moments of exaggeration that do not affect the story and somewhat enhance the flawed Mr. Rochester as he is the master of his domain, although it is a living hell to him, and he is the epitomeof a a character in a patriarchal society in which man is king.    To see the twists and turns and the more in depth emotions of these two characters brought to life, with the vivid imagery, excellent dialogue and the ability of these two characters to be so intwined as to truly know how to handle each other was a pleasure to watch. I applaud PBS and only ask for more.
B000J10ER4|5.0|I was really excited when I found out they were going to be showing parts of this movie in 3-D at Imax.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to get to the theatre in time (my local Imax is two hours away).     I thought I was just going to have to suffer and watch it in regular 2-D until I found out there is a new type of 3-D glasses that work on regular movies. I was amazed![[ASIN:B000W9Y294 TV Eyes 3-D Glasses: Watch any movie in 3-D]] It didn't look like the old red/green 3-D, for one it didn't mess up the colors, but it did make the picture look clearer and deeper and the people looked more solid. It didn't jump out of the screen at me like it would have at Imax, but then I don't have a thirty foot television either.     What was really great about Superman Returns was that parts of the movie had been deliberately made for 3-D, so the effect looked especially good on those parts.  But I also got to watch the rest of the movie in 3-D too, which I wouldn't have got to do at Imax.    The scene where Superman is catching the airplane looked great. In fact, all the flying scenes looked better. I've watched the movie in regular 2-D (it's just a regular dvd after all) and somehow when you watch it in 3-D it looks more like he's really up there in the sky, it seems like he has more weight and could really fall.  When you see it in 2-D he's just sort of stuck in the picture, like he's pasted onto the sky.    Considering they had a new actor playing Superman I thought he did a really wonderful job. Not only was he trying to portray and upbeat, modern version of Superman, but he was also trying to be Christopher Reeves at the same time. He did a superb job.  I always hated in the old movies how they had Clark Kent being a dork, and Lex Luthor wasn't much better, but in this new version they're more believable.  Still a bit over the top at times, but then they are based on comic book characters.  And at least Luthor is bald.  Actually the actor they got to play him was perfect forthe part, he even looked like the Luthor I remember from the old 80's comics, a bit stocky and bald as an egg, but carrying it off   with power and style.    I really loved all the sly references to the movie they put in there. I didn't even notice a lot of them the first time because they were done so smooth, they didn't feel out of context at all.    And you can really tell that the director was a comic book fan, there are several scenes in the movie taken directly from the comics. The scene where Superman stops the womans car, and has to put it down gently, front end first, is right off the cover of the very first Superman Action comic book.  And the scene where Superman is flying down into his Fortress of Solitude, one leg sort of drawn up, and most of him in shadow, is almost exactly a rendition of one of the more modern Superman iconic posters.     They did a far better job on this movie than I expected.  There's more human warmth and struggle to it than you'd expect from a superhero movie. I hope they go on to make more.
0375423877|3.0|I was extremely disappointed with this book. They made it seem like the huge mystery would be about the missing boy and it really wasn't anything but a chapter. It was just ok to me---I have read better.

B00005JLEU|5.0|You certainly don't have to be Japanese to enjoy this marvel of animated film-making. (Although thanks to the reviewer who gave explanations for some of the details. I really appreciate knowing what those candy things are that so delight the soot ball creatures.)<br /><br />As with all the Miyazaki films I've seen--and much loved--you start with some time in the protagonist's normal, non-magical world (whether a long time or short, depending on the film.) Here, we are in a car with Chigiro and her parents, as they are on their way to a new home. Chigiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, but her parents tell her she should look at it as an adventure, as all new places are adventures.<br /><br />Oh, how prophetic.<br /><br />They pass a plot of grassy land by the side of the road cluttered with tiny shrines to a host of spirits. Another bit of foreshadowing. The parents are skeptical as they explain to Chigiro what they are.<br /><br />Then they park the car at a dead-end in the road, and enter a tunnel which takes them to an unusual, seemingly deserted place. Chigiro's papa says it's an abandoned amusement park. They explore this place that has echoes of Easter Island, with these partly toppled, partly buried  huge stone faces. Then they find colorful streets crammed with restaurants, all empty. All but one. While no people are in sight, the restaurant brims with tempting delicacies (though, er, fishheads aren't my thing). Chigiro's parents begin to feast. She does not. She wanders...<br /><br />And the adventure officially BEGINS!<br /><br />This is no abandoned, mundane amusement park. This is the land of spirits, and a central point of action turns out to be a bathhouse where non-human creatures of all manner (some dreadful, some mysterious, some hilarious, all interesting) come to clean up and relax and feast.<br /><br />Chigiro receives the help of some of these non-humans, and is challenged and threatened by others, but there is no obvious villain, for, as in other Miyazaki works, characters are complex, with both good and not-so-good in their characters, whether it's self-indulgence or abuse of power or greed or gluttony or grudge-holding or whatever. And even good or well-meaning deeds can go all wrong. But, as with other Miyazaki works, compassion and bravery and hard work and sacrifice go a long, long way. And helping hands come when need is greatest. And a sort of benevolent providence watches over the world. This is what gives such magic to this work--as it does Princess Mononoke or My Neighbor Totoro, etc. Fine characterization, extraordinary visions of the magical, magnificent artistry, and a gentle heart that runs throughout.<br /><br />And there is always the too-too-too adorable or cute for words critter. In Totoro, it was the beasts themselves (especially chibi) and the cute soot critters. In Mononoke it was the tree spirits that made me laugh and laugh. Here, it's, yes, the cute little soot things again, but also the hilarious tiny bird with the mosquito-buzzing wings and the chubby, bouncy mouse with attitude. And even the radish monster was a hoot.<br /><br />I love the manifestations of gentleness and generosity and goodness in Miyazaki's works. Here, Chigiro helps a Faceless Spirit whose loneliness is a palpable things. The ride in the train at night is evocative and blends a sort of sadness and hope and resolve. The music chosen for this exceptional sequence is perfect--a haunting piano piece. The scene with the Stink monster who is not what he seems is at first remarkably amusing, then remarkably surprising--and yes, again, magical.<br /><br />This is not a film you want to miss. It has strong family values (as does My Neighbor Totoro and Howl's Moving Castle), and hopefulness.<br /><br />It's just a total, utter treat for the eyes and ears and spirit of children and adults alike.

006092988X|4.0|Francie begins this story as an eleven-year-old, living in poverty in Brooklyn.  Her father is an alcoholic who takes part-time work as a singing waiter.  Her mother cleans houses to bring in most of their money.  Francie and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, help out by collecting bits of scrap metal and other valuables to sell to the junk man for recycling.  The family lives in a tiny apartment, is looked down on by many others and often they go hungry when money doesn't stretch far enough to buy food. <br /> <br />Despite all of the hardships in her life, though, Francie is nearly overwhelmed by the beauty of the life she is living.  She loves her father's singing voice, and she loves the things her mother is able to cook with their meager supply of food.  She finds peace in listening to her parents talk late at night, and joy in reading every book she can get her hands on.  She is happy in the way only a child can be. <br /> <br />As Francie grows up, she comes to find that life is often hard, and her family is less fortunate than many.  She observes the sacrifices her family members make, and is called upon to make sacrifices of her own.  Throughout it all, though, she never loses her determination or her love for her family and for Brooklyn. <br /> <br />The way Francie thinks and writes is absolutely beautiful.  I like how Smith captured that peculiar habit of children to see the beauty in even the worst of circumstances.  I liked the beginning of this book much better than the end, though.  I was eager to see Francie and her family come into some money and have an easier life, but I felt the end of the book to be a bit too happy to fit with the rest.  When an entire book is about struggling and fending for yourself, it doesn't seem right when something good happens, as it did to Francie's mother, out of the blue.
B00005JPAJ|2.0|I knew little of what to expect from this movie, so I wasn't terribly surprised to discover that, in reality, it really is nothing more than an international version of \\"Crash.\\" The movie revolves around four stories, all but one with an immediate link to each other, and the same heavy-handed, manipulative story-telling that last year's Academy Award winner gave us. This movie will work for some - most, maybe - but if one doesn't swallow the typical Holllywood line and can think for themselves, they will probably see through the thin veneer of this film very quickly. <br /> <br />Put simply, this film just doesn't make sense logically. Yes, the premise is that through various cultures and languages and mistakes and the fact that people don't listen as much as they talk they often find themselves in precarious situations. Okay, that was beaten into the audience, ad nauseum.  <br /> <br />Yet, the film isn't tight, there are too many moronic moments and too many times when one might find themselves saying, \\"Yeah, but who would DO that?!?\\" If a couple is having marital difficulties would a man seriously book him and his wife with a tour to a third world country like Morocco? Over a tropical island or a European destination? And would a wife who is so eager NOT to go still get on a plane willingly? Huh? Would two boys who know that a gun can kill/injure a jackel then shoot at a moving vehicle and NOT realize they might injure some one inside? Really.... And would a couple really truly go halfway around the world - leaving the country - and leave their two children in the care of some one not related, in the country illegally, and not leave her with any emergency contact numbers or the names of anyone close by? (like, in the same city, maybe?) Sure about that? And are these people so hermitlike that if they do need to have some one other than the nanny take care of their kids there are no neighbors, no friends, no colleagues they know or trust? Does anyone really live like this? These are just some of the \\"suspensions of belief\\" this movie is asking viewers to make. Unbelievable. <br /> <br />There is a segment that takes place in Japan that at first seems out of place and never really connects fully to the movie. In fact, it was like watching two movies, which was rather bizarre in some way. And I think I liked that other, Japanese movie better, but the director left so much of it unfinished. A shame, really. Perhaps he should have dumped this Babel stuff, picked up the remnants of the Japanese story, fleshed that story out, and made a whole new movie. Now THAT would have been something to see! Infinitely more enjoyable! <br /> <br />This movie was okay. If you liked Crash and you like films that are manipulative and you really don't mind if films make any sense whatsoever, you might get a lot out of this one. Otherwise, steer clear. You will be frustrated. <br />

B00006LHYC|3.0|I love Laura. She's got an amazing voice, as powerful and bright as Celine Dion's but also with the ability to purr softly and convey tons of emotion. Her Escucha album completely floored me, I listened to it over and over again, and the one thing that I missed was really understanding the lyrics (not that it made any difference...). So buying her English debut was an easy call. <br /> <br />The first time I listened through it, I was disappointed (well...mad), though. Another reviewer put it thusly: \\"it's as if the people handling her english songs don't quite know which ones are best for her\\". That's for sure, and moreover, they didn't do her any justice in arranging & producing the songs that they DID give her. Laura is great, and there are tracks on this disc where she carries them, but there are also silly mis-steps. Lyrics that just don't work, moments where you know the producer voicecoached her into certain deliveries (how they managed to make her sound like Natalie Imbruglia in one song, I'll never understand), and when you've got one of the finest voices in international pop music, you don't overdub her three times or throw a GOSPEL CHORUS behind her!  <br /> <br />Having said that, once you get past the surprise at what her producers did wrong, you can focus on what Laura does right, and she sounds great. This is a good addition to the Pausini catalog, and makes her a little more understandable to people who just don't get why you'd listen to someone singing in Italian or Spanish if you don't speak the language. What I'd really love to hear from Laura is another English album, perhaps a mix of good originals and some carefully selected covers, and maybe a duet or two in there to boot. I found out about her through her appearance with Michael Buble, and fell in love with her voice in that duet.
0743455967|5.0|On Writing is a little different to most of the other texts out there on writing fiction. SK starts out the first third of the book in almost autobiographical fashion so you can maybe gain some insights into his head space when he writes. Lets just say for someone who is oh so very famous now he came from oh so very humble beginnings. A very poor family, terrible ear infections, dead end jobs and even alcoholism and eventually drug addiction to boot (can't even remember writing Cujo). The one constant he had through all those times was writing. Writing writing writing and a never say die attitude. I think this is one of the things I admire about him most, despite all the rejections, despite all the setbacks, despite being truly dirt poor white trailer trash, there was always writing. <br /> <br />The middle of the book talks about how SK writes today, his regimes, his thoughts on the craft and his utter, utter disdain for the adverb (have I used one yet? God I hope not...) and his ideas behind plot and story. It's interesting to note that SK is another author who doesn't do a lot of pre-planning or plotting before he starts to write. He just gets his initial idea, shuts the door to his office, and dumps everything out of his head in his first draft. It's the second draft when he \\"writes with the door open\\", when he lets others see it. But that first draft, it's just one big ole purge.  <br /> <br />The end of the book talks about almost dying after being hit by a car while on one of his daily walks. This man came so very close to death, and then crawled back from it. Maybe it was payback for the author he tortured in Misery :-)  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed On Writing as SK talks about most of his writing coming from a gut feeling, an instinct, and not worrying too much about what is going to happen next because your characters will let you know. He talks about doing his 2,000 word a day quota and if he is done by 10:30am then great, if he is still plugging away at3:30pm it doesn't matter, just as long as he gets that 2,000 in.  <br /> <br />If you are keen to buy another book about writing, but are a little tired of the same ole \\"You must know the book's premise\\" etc (not that it doesn't have it's place) then On Writing is something you can enjoy a bit more for it's very readable quality and advice.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Why are all you \\"fans\\" whining?  This is the most high energy concert event of this decade and what's more...  it's been released it in its entirety!!!  Not as a documentary (Truth or Dare and IGTTYAS) and not as an edited, made for television special.  What you're getting is the full-length spectacle...  \\"The Confessions Tour.\\"  Excellent editing, brilliant staging and choreography.  A fine setlist that showcases the \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" album and includes a few classic gems, \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Like A Virgin\\" to name a few.  Furthermore, you're getting a bonus live CD of a selection of some of the setlist.  So all you so-called fans... stop whining!  And if you did not actually go to the show, please refrain from writing an unfavorable review.  While this DVD & CD set is a good representation of the show, it is certainly not the same as expierencing the show live.  For me (and for most of the fans that attended the show) this release is more of a souvenier that allows you to relive the show over and over again.   So to all you whiners that call yourself \\"fans\\"... get a life and learn how to appreciate a Madonna release and stop trashing it by adding the \\"should have beens\\" to your review.  Madonna rules!
6305364648|5.0|True Lies is a spy film that doesn't take itself as seriously as The Saint or the newer James Bond films--it borders on campiness, without ever crossing that line. While it gets its chuckles (Jamie Lee Curtis beaning Schwarzenegger with the phone), True Lies also manages to deliver suspense and a healthy dose of blood-pumping action. It's a clever, fun and entertaining movie. <br /> <br />The story revolves around Schwarzenegger who (along with sidekick Tom Arnold) is a Federal agent \\"deep\\"-undercover; his wife of 10+ years and his daughter have no idea. When he discovers that his wife is possibly cheating on him, Schwarzenegger plays a practical joke on her that winds up embroiling them both in a real terrorist plot to smuggle nuclear arms into the States. <br /> <br />The action sequences and special effects are all top-notch and the cast is fairly all-star. Even some minor characters who weren't stars then, are now (like Eliza Dushku). If you're one of those people who normally takes exception to Schwarzenegger films, you should know that this is one of his more entertaining roles--but then, Arnie isn't for everyone. <br /> <br />As a fun, original, things-blowing-up flick, with a good deal of humor besides, this is a five star film.
B000001GX5|5.0|I decided to purchase this particular CD because I did not have these compositions in my collection. I have always loved the works by Respighi, & based on the reputations of Deutsche Grammaphon, Herbert von Karajan & the Berlin Philharmonic I expected the highest quality in performance and interpretation, & they did not disappoint. They are enchanting, soothing, Italian visions of Rome. Listening to the music on this CD makes it possible to take a break & mentally transport yourself to the parks & fountains of Rome.
B000JJRIO8|1.0|STOP putting artists that 2pac would have probablynever worked with on his songs! I don't understand why people think these dumb beats and radio rap artists are gonna do justice to a pac album. Haha this cd is SO bad! Afeni needs to let a legit producer create tracks like those on Better Dayz. These people producing his stuff now never even met him and don't know his style. Might as well let Biz Markie on the albums. Whatever I'm over it. RIP Pac sorry they're putting this gay stuff out with your name on it it's too bad. I'm surprised Akon isn't on here. Ashanti....WOW....have DRE or QUICK or someone like that produce...no one else.
068987474X|1.0|I am so happy this fruitcake's ignorant show is canceled. Too bad a book can't be canceled.......if you can't take the hint when a guy claims to be \\"too busy\\" to call you back or to make plans with you, then you don't need a book, you need a dose of self-esteem and maybe a restraining order.
B000002KDM|5.0|Well people, you'll be pleased to know that after my last review I have managed to stay out of trouble. Mostly, I have been giving Seer lessons to a gifted friend of mine known as T. He has turned out to be a good apprentice - but I must be careful. I have caught him trying on my Seers hat when I wasn't looking and, not only that, has started giving lectures in the mid-west using my name. My guides advised me not to sue. Guido suggested reasoning with him (HAH! like reasoning worked with him!). Marshy thought it wise for her to lull him with her collagen lips. And Chance? He wanted to use strong-arm tactics which goes against my beloved nature. So- again- I will have to figure this out for myself.<br /><br />No nevermind all that. Your gifted Metamorpho made his way down to the dungeon (with de-humidifier) to check the archives for a worthy selection. I came up with a wonderful album to review. I am sure you will all agree.<br /><br />Ahhhh..... we have James Taylor here (Yes! With lots of hair!), which goes to show you that there was a time when he wasn't the \\"constant\\" icon that we all know and love today. However, this album is testimony to his wonderful talent and ability which has been there from the start. And the songs? Lovely, lilting, uplifting, pensive, hopeful vignettes that convey a peace and serenity rarely found so early in one's career.<br /><br />What matters so most here is the ensemble playing. So comfortable-so warm. James' acoustic guitar along with walking bass, electric guitar fills, tasty piano bits and understated but effective drums. We even have a banjo chiming in and horns on some selections. This \\"just right\\" combination really is a pleasure to hear now and a much needed mellow escape from current a go-go, hammering dischordant chordal offerings that frenzy all our fine nervous systems. No- in this proffering you have to imagine yourself on a sunny day by a lake. Hummingbirds flying around and the sky so blue and filled with cotton candy clouds. This album is easy-going. A fine example of soft acoustic composition. It has a little bit of country soul sprinkled with homegrown natural personality. Nothing pretentious here people. Meet you down at the swimming brook.<br /><br />There really are no big statements here- which - in a way makes it more refreshing. From the start- James gives us an uplift with \\"Love Has Brought Me Around\\". Then, the deserved Carole King classic \\"You've Got a Friend\\". And you know, as well as I, that the friend here is not a human as we know it. We get some melancholy (\\"Places In My Past\\", \\"Hey Mister, That's Me Up On the Jukebox\\", \\"Long Ago and Far Away\\"), some breaking free groove (\\"Let Me Ride\\"), survival and moving on (\\"Highway Song\\"). Did I mention the saga of \\"Machine Gun Kelly\\"?  A home grown boy gone astray. How could James forget that legend?  This album also has lovely acoustic only tunes \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" and \\"Isn't It Nice to be Home Again\\". With these, James proves what a vital force he is by himself.<br /><br />In closing, let me say that I am struck by how good and reinvigorating most of these tunes are. There are bleak moments yes- but there is always the sunshine and hope to move you past the negative. This album is a warm sweater on a cold winter's day and a glass of ice tea during a heatwave. Investigate what a true artist can do.<br /><br />Now I must go. The guides have sounded the alarm that T is now taking his lectures into the Bible Belt and I have to stop him before the picketts and the protestors begin to swarm. Must protect my reputation you know!<br /><br />Must go. More archival finds will be on their way soon!<br /><br />Thru the eye of a needle-your own.........Metamorphobum is easy-going.

0618680004|4.0|My husband gave me this book as a gift for the holidays.  I left for Iraq before Xmas, and he thought this would be a good book for me to read while on my deployment.  When he caught me reading it before I left he asked why I wasn't waiting.  I told him that I could not read this book on deployment, because I couldn't let others around me know that I was an atheist.  After I read this book I realized that in order to stop this maddening cycle of religious fanaticism both in the US and Iraq it is my responsibility as an atheist to let other people know that it is ok not to believe in God or religion.  It is those two very things that have caused the over 3,000 young men and women to give their lives in a land that can be described as anything but Paradise.  I watch fellow Soldiers talk about their spiritual experiences at church, and I keep silent as they play their Christian music, but it amazes me how they can not see the parallels between their own personal religious fervor and the similar zeal of the insurgents who would slice every last one of our throats if given the opportunity.<br /><br />Thanks to Dawkins I am more confident about being an atheist in a war zone.  If someone asks me what my religious preference is I tell them none. I just wish they'd put that on my dog tags instead of no-preference, because I do have a preference and it is NONE.  I also do not bow my head during an invocation, because we'll never eradicate this religiosity in everything we do unless we stop playing into these traditions.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I was ready to stop watching these Bond movies, actually I did not see the last couple. I was suprised how good this was. Good plot, good effects and good entertainment. Reminds me of the classic 60's and 70's Bond films, only updated for today. This has nothing to do with the original Casino Royale with Peter Sellers. I would like to own this DVD when it is available.
B00005ASOI|5.0|Suspiria is a movie by Dario Argentio. A legend in the horror movie genre. The film follows the frightening adventures of a young woman who starts her first semester at a prestigious dance school. She soon finds out that the school is run by some every sinister individuals who have some gruesome plans for her and her classmates. Suspiria is easily the most beautiful horror movie ever made. A bold statement perhaps but once you watch it you may easily agree. The scences in the film are highlighted by psychedelic reds and blues that i've never witnessed in a film before. Dario really uses the color sceem of the film to enhance it's eerie atmosphere. With the visualls aside, another of the films great achievements is its soundtrack. You can just be watching one of the characters sleeping or walking down a hallway but the music alone makes these simple actions truly frightening. Suspria is an odyessy of auditory and visual horror that needs to been seen to be believed. If you're a fan of horror you must see SUSPIRIA!
B00062PN6I|2.0|COMFORT: <br />When I first put on the headphones, they didn't completely seal over my ears because the top part of the ear cushions pressed against the top part of my head above my ear, leaving the bottom open, and unsealed. This didn't really affect the bass in any noticeable way, it was just uncomfortable and let in some of the outside noise. Couldn't wear these for more than about four hours without becoming uncomfortable because of the top part of the ear cushions pressing against my head. The headband is very short, vertically. With the headphones extended all the way below the headband, they were barley big enough to fit on my head. (I don't have a big head, neither a small one, just a normal one.) <br /> <br />To fix this I took apart the headphones and pulled the headband strip all the way out of the ear cups, put the ear cups back together,  then pushed the the strips back in until they wouldn't go in anymore because of the part that stops them from coming completely out. Then I taped it together, then added some padding to the top of the headband so it would rest against my head better since the headphones were now slightly oversized. Now they're more comfortable and seal better, though they look do goofy. <br /> <br />SOUND QUALITY: <br />The sound of the bass and treble is like what you would get from average store bought headphones, with a bass boost bass. <br /> <br />TREBLE: <br />These are not HiFi professional quality headphones. These headphones sound like small speakers inside of ear cups. The treble has a few of dips and peaks. None of them stand out over the full sound range, but it's fatiguing to listen to anything with these headphones. Turning up the volume won't help a bit, just make it sound worse. <br /> <br />BASS: <br />These headphones have a nice sounding bass boost, just right. It sounds like the bass boost switch on a cd player is turned on. The overall audible bass extends from a few hundred Hz to 55-60Hz, nice 'beefy sounding' bass. The bass extends only to about 40Hz, not to 20Hz like advertised, although if you play some really loud bass at 30 or 20Hz, you'll hear it. These headphones have a bass port inside the ear cups. <br /> <br />OTHER: <br />The advertised sensitivity is stated as 105dB@1kHz, but when I compared them to my Sony headphones which had a 102dB sensitivity, these sounded like 108dB. They do sound extra loud. These do a good job at blocking outside noise. These headphones are rated as able to handle 100mW, not much you think, but with that extra senitivity it sounds like 1000mW, either way they can be very loud. With a sensitivity of 102dB/mW and a maximum power handling of 100mW, these can get up to 125dB in you ears. <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: <br />-2 for professional sound quality, <br />-1 for bad fit, <br />+1 for average sound and extra bass, <br />+1 for extra sensitivity, extra loud sounding headphones. <br /> <br />These are not professional quality sounding headphones, just average sounding headphones, with extra bass. <br />I don't recommended them for professionals, only for average users.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|<br />I'm only giving her 4 stars because her accent was just too much!! And I hear the same comments from non-spanish speakers who couldn't understand her \\"Don't bother\\" song.  So, I had to read the lyrics, because otherwise, I wouldn't know what on earth she was singing about.   <br /> <br />Once I passed this phase, I really enjoyed her songs.  It's true, there weren't many songs that I thought were great, but not one of them was bad.  I love this girl, and, personally, they were all decent.  <br /> <br />Songs you must have:  <br /> <br />Dreams for plans, Illegal, the Day and the Time, Your Embrace, and Something, oh.. and maybe How do you Do.  <br /> <br />The others were too pop for my taste and I don't recommend them.   <br /> <br />However, if your are a true fan, you must buy this CD!! <br />
B000K7UBTI|2.0|*Sigh* <br /> <br />Origin stories are all well and good, but the title character doesn't even appear in the film until it's half over.  The focus here is on the flawed Tony Stark, rather than his heroic alter ego.  With a changed origin, this could have been an interesting film, but it was just so incredibly tedious.  Yes, Tony Stark is a jet-setting playboy and yes, two of the three females presented in the film are naked (hidden by steam or fog), and yes, the Stark board of directors is filled with evil, money-grubbing lawyers.  We get it.  Move on. <br /> <br />The animation when *not* in the battle sequences is quite good.  Unfortunately, the 4 evil elementals, the dragon, and Iron Man himself were rendered using an incredibly unrealistic CGI.  The characters themselves look stiff and wooden - like they were rendered on a home system and not a professional unit.  The characters actually bounce through the scenes, rarely having any meaningful relationship to their environment or actual gravity.  They moved like a collection of characters from an old video game, rather than state of the art animation. <br /> <br />*Sigh* <br /> <br />At least, when Iron Man did *finally* make an appearance, we were treated to several versions of the armor.  It was interesting to note just which version of the armor was the most powerful and durable. <br /> <br />So - if you love Iron Man more than life itself, or you are a completist who needs every bit of Marvel animation ever created, by all means buy this DVD.  Otherwise, rent it.  Or better yet, find someone else who already bought it and pick it up from them - cheap.
0783225857|5.0|Wonderful condition. Brand new with no scratches on the outside or inside.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|By now,  most know this is a documentary following Al Gore's traveling presentation on the dangers of global warming.  This documentary puts together all the facts and shows footage of the melting of the glaciers, as well as other evidence, to present a convincing argrument of the immiment threat of global warming.  The end of the film leaves us with the reassurance that something can be done with the right political pressures and our own conservation.    I would have liked to have heard some of the agruments from those that don't believe that civilization adds to the global warming problem.  Although Mr. Gore may not agree with those views, I would have liked to have at least heard their viewpoint and perhaps seen Mr. Gore criticize the more prevalent arguments from the non-believers.    Overall, you will get some understanding of an important issue.  I'm sure there is more to it than this film depicts, but it's certainly a good foundation.     Obviously, this isn't a film you would want to watch on a Friday night after a long week at work.  But, if you can find the right time to see it, it is an important film.
B000KGGLCU|4.0|Okay, perhaps I'm biased being a Madonna fan for years now but I can say that this concert is worth owning on DVD. 'Confessions on a Dance Floor' brought Madonna back to her pop/dance roots. This tour for her brought her back to a high in energy, dancing queen, pop icon. She weaves in catchy songs such as 'Jump' and 'Sorry' with a message that she hopes the audience will pick up on. There's a great interlude that introduces a new mix of 'Sorry' that has Madonna telling leaders of the world such as Tony Blair, President Bush, and Condi. Rice (who appear in video form) that they need to stop telling lies and stories and 'she's not going to take it anymore.'<br /><br />In all, what makes this concert great is that it's more than just a live concert showcasing songs from her 'Confessions' album. It's a pop spectacle, weaving in attractive visuals, intricate dance routines and fresh new remixes of older songs from her catalogue such as 'Like a Virgin' and 'Lucky Star'. This concert will make you want to get up and dance with Madonna, sing along, it gets you pumped and excited.<br /><br />Minor complaints; I did feel the picture quality could have been a tad bit better on the DVD. I liked the fancy digital case BUT I wish the book could have been left out seperate instead of glued onto one of the covers. And it would have been nice if the box stays closed a bit more than it does once you open it. As for extras, this is perhaps the first concert she's released with bonus materials ... and they're a bit lame. It's basically all behind-the-scenes stuff showing what went into making the tour. It would have been nice to have had some of the back drop screen videos, or why not the videos she released along with the singles during the past year or so? Maybe even add in some of her performances such as at the Koko club where she performed a great remix of 'Everybody.' It seemed as if a lot could have been done in terms of extras but we're just given a little glimpse of production.<br /><br />As for the live CD, I wish it had been a bit better. It would  have been nice if it had included a bonus track of some sort, like the 'I'm Going to tell You a Secret\\" release did. Why not a studio version of Confessions' 'Like a Virgin', 'Music Inferno', 'Lucky Star' or some song that was cut for whatever reason? Instead we're given 'Confessions' which is her dancers relating hard times from their lives ... not to be rude but it's dull and unnecessary and a shame that a track like that would make it on as opposed to some of these songs such as 'Drowned World' and 'Paradise (Not for Me)'.<br /><br />In all, the DVD release of the 'Confessions Tour' is good, but it does have some flaws. It's a bit skimpy on the extras, some of the audio isn't exactly great and could have been remastered to be more crisp or something. I'd still suggest you buy it because it's the most entertaining show you could ever want from Madonna and she makes sure you're getting your money's worth.uction.  <br /> <br />As for the live CD, I wish it had been a bit better.

B000002OX5|4.0|Everything we take for granted in the Whonivese - Townshend's arty lyrics and approach set to crushing rock 'n' roll, is found here. This album is essentially a transitional effort from the Mod days to the rock days. In the spirit of it being transitional, it's not perfect: Silas Stingy (one of Entwistle's worst), Armenia City in the Sky; Sunrise and Rael (only worth noting because its instrumental break was the basis for the Sparks riff from Tommy.<br />On the other hand, this is a lot of fun, and simply one of the Who's best. An ode to pirate radio, it's stuffed with mock-commercial jingles, all of which are a riot. More importantly, it contains some of the Who's key songs: I Can See For Miles was probably the heaviest song ever made at the time, and still packs a punch now. Marianne with the Shaky Hand returns the [..]theme from Pictures of Lily, this time with an easygoing (dare I say mellow?) folk-pop melody and such. Tattoo is one of the group's funniest, a song about coming of age told in a lighthearted way. Our Love Was is one of their best pop songs, and there's also the quasi-spiritual I Can't Reach You.
B000M4RG42|5.0|I am reminded, in this case of the Ira Hayes character, played by one of the most ernest and sincere actors I've seen in years, Adam Beach, that even though a tough, unified Corp is made into team...it is really the individual that comes forth. <br />  I congratulate Mr. Eastwood, who has rounded into a solid and ambitious Director. I also look forward to the sequel, Letters From Iwo Jima and wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer (in this group) who suggested all films should show both sides.  <br />  Perhaps then we can come to understand that when it's all said and done, the politician takes over what they started...and the men who were uprooted and displaced do indeed have to fight endless inner demons. <br />  This is an achievement I see here. I would favor more films like this. Naturally I know (given the time frame) that all stories cannot be told but some portions can...and it is then up to us, to take it beyond that. <br />  Well done and recommended.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I have all Norah Jones previous CD's & I like this CD just as much. <br /> <br />
B00005ASHM|5.0|There is nothing that I can say about this album that hasn't already been said.. But I would like to express my profound moment of discovery when I first listened to it.. I had the preconception that the Beach boys were just a bunch of dumb surfers.. My musical tastes leaned towards jazz, classical, and more progressive rock.. But I kept on seeing this album on lists of the greatest albums of all time so.. I gave it a try. I wasn't prepared for the beauty of this perfect musical mixture of sounds and moods.. It was clearly a very personal record that expressed many feelings I had at the time.. the production is brilliant.. being a big fan of the beatles I immediately heard simmilarities between George Martin<br /><br />and Sgnt Pepper and how they must have been influenced by this record.. This is not surfer music - it is much more..
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This movie is nothing more than propoganda. Educate and research Global Warming yourself instead of taking some politicians' word for it.
B000002KIK|1.0|Now, lets hold on a second. I think that everyone is entitled to their own opinions when it comes to music, but to award this album five stars just cannot be justified. I've heard farts sound better than this record... absolutely the worst thing OZZY ever stamped his name on.<br />Sabbath didn't fire OZZ, he flew the coop.... \\"whoah guys, I-I-I... uh... is this what we're doing now?, I think I need to..\\"{ziiiiing}<br />And he was gone. Just like that.<br /><br />In a time when metal was hardly a classification, Black Sabbath had no real boundaries... and that should be made absolutely clear. This disc should come with a warning label SONGS CONTAIN LARGE HORN SECTIONS MUCH TOO BOMBASTIC FOR METAL....<br /><br />The band had an idea and they went with it. Iommi I guess decided that it was time to turn down the guitars, and turn up the keyboards, and the trumpets... and he wanted Ozzy to drop the doom thing, and try singing in a Motown girl group style.<br /><br />This album stinks. Simple. Obvious that Ozzy and Iommi needed to split ways, because both Sabbath and Ozzy would come out with amazing albums a year or two later... Sabbaths HEaven and Hell (with DIO) and Ozzys Blizzard.<br /><br />PS- no way is it better than Technical Ecstacy either, that album still had rocking songs like Back Street Kids. This album had Johnny Blade.. have you ever listened to that garbage?

B00009Y3L4|5.0|An admirable, and incredibly hard hitting view of nazi Germany wrapped in a glossy layer of songs, spangles and slapstick. This was a breakthrough in so many ways - acknowledging the Holocaust, the horror for the everyday people of Germany, using satire and music to bring home a chilling message about the disintegration of social values. Then we also deal with homosexuality, drug use, abortion and many other 'tabu' subjects These were things Hollywood wasn't too keen to explore, so TEN stars for the groundbreaking this film achieved.<br /><br />That said, I would encourage anyone to get to a live production. See the show as it was originally written (the film adaptation makes a completely different story really). It is a far more compelling, funny and then heart breaking experience. And not one that COULD be captured on film.<br /><br />Two faces, same coin...
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I was so excited to see Norah had a new CD coming out that I pre-ordered it. BIG mistake! I'm not doing that again with NJ. The first album was incredible, the second almost as good but this third one I'm having trouble even getting through the whole thing. I like mellow music but this is ridiculous, I'm falling asleep! I am making myself listen to the album a few times, but besides a couple of songs that are just ok, I am not really enjoying it. I'm fighting myself to keep from forwarding to the next track in mid-song. Most of the songs sound the same and I can't tell one from the next. To the reviewers who insist you have to read the lyrics... Yes lyrics are important but this is music, if I can't bare to listen to it, what's the point? The magic of the first album is no where to be found in this one.  <br /> <br />My advice: Listen to it before you buy it because obviously there are some people who love this cd, maybe you are one of those few.

B00008DZ81|3.0|In this second movie we find quite the same flaws and assets of the first one: direction and screenplay are rather weaker than the rest, they would have needed better editing, but they are somewhat better than in the first.<br /><br />Probably because of the fact that characters and settings have already been introduced before, the movie concentrates more on the actual story which flows well to its satisfying end. Acting is superb and the quality of the filming as well as the scenes nearly breathtaking.<br /><br />In this second movie too there are several variations in the plot but the spirit of the book remains untouched.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|The long awaited \\"Part II\\" has finally arrived! I guess I was one of the few that thought \\"BE\\" was a flawless masterpiece...but \\"Scarsick\\" just tears the roof off of anything they have ever done. While dense metaphors and beautiful poetry remain fully intact, Scarsick makes full use of wicked political commentary and, well (a first for POS), muliple uses of the f-bomb.  Never, is it used as a vulgarity...as you would expect from Gildenlow.  A huge rant over the net concerns the lyrics to the song \\"America\\". I am an American, and I must say that I find the lyrics to be a wake up call to the US. This is what most other countries think of us right now, mostly because of Bush. Americans (especially those 28% that still think W is the best president in our history) really need to pay attention. This record really makes a point on how a taste for blood and war for the sake of some god destroys the soul. Some people need to put down their puffed-up pride and really listen to this. Amazing stuff!

0425180638|3.0|Here Scarpetta becomes a little more human when her boss attempts to indict her for murder. However, that indictment concept is just not believable if you've met her increasingly impossibly impeccable self through the prior books. No one in their right mind would do that to perfect Kay.  <br /> <br />You always know she is going to get off the hook, therefore the entertainment factor takes over. I found the regular cast of characters a bit worn out and caricatures of their formerly interesting selves. (I swear they used to have lives outside of their jobs, and were actually sometimes unpredictable) The best thing about this book is that it leaves you wanting to know more about Jaime Berger, the attorney from NY. Berger reminds me of Scarpetta's character in Cornwell's earlier books - refreshing.  <br /> <br />Other than the suspense between Berger and Scarpetta, I thought the plot was impossibly and intricately conspiratorial and too tidy to be believable. However, the book is entertaining due to the intracacies, of course the forensics, Cornwell's gift of writing, and the introduction of Berger.  <br /> <br />The reason I read this to begin with was my own attachment to Scarpetta through Cornwell's earlier works and my knowledge that Cornwell is a terrific writer.  Perhaps a new series starring Berger would be nice :)  Her character is the main reason I will read the sequel. The other reason is that Cornwell can make anything entertaining. (Who else could get a 3 star rating using an over the top plot and tired, predictable characters?)  <br />
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|A combination of Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton was delightful. Edward Norton, who plays \\"Eisenheim,\\" does a great job at making his character mysterious, humble, and impassioned. Giamatti does a great job at not only completely changing his voice and accent, but at playing the snide, shrewd chief inspector.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell, many of us may have seen him as the villain in \\"The Legend of Zorro,\\" also does a fine job at playing the clever, and observant villain. Only he, in the movie, knew what really occured on that fateful night his wife \\"disappeared.\\"<br /><br />As for the story, Eisenheim reaquaints himself with his childhood lover, who he could never be together with due to social status constraints in early Vienna. However, she is engaged to the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who is also obsessed with Eisenheim the Illusionist.<br /><br />Great film, very suspenseful. But the way at which the ending comes at you in this film is totally flawed. Unlike the ending in \\"The Prestige,\\" this one is rushed, and instead of saying, \\"Oooh! I see\\" you say, \\"Uhhh...wait, what?\\" It all comes together, without any hinting, in less than 15 seconds. Seriously. The ending could have had some clues and hints and came in gradually. But not this one, it will leave you a bit disappointed. I was also disappointed in how all the magic was CGI. How could Eisenheim actually have performed the magic, like they did in \\"The Prestige\\"? I mean, in this movie he's not an illusionist, he's a freaking wizard! And I didn't like that the hero of the movie frames someone for murder.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|This is supposed to deepen the concept of mutant alienation and potential war, raising the stakes with ever more spectacular special effects.  I admit, from a hard sci-fi pt of view, I found this weaker than the first - it is more like magic, this \\"mind power\\" that can be bent to threaten, well, everyone.  But the acting is absolutely excellent, even moving (if a comic book ever could be), and there are fabulous moments in the film, from the violent romp of Nightcrawler in the WHite House to Magneto's ingenious and frightening escape with three balls of steel.  These things are a visual treat.  Then there is the evolution of WOlverine, who is the most interesting character by far.  Virtually all of the characters are spectacularly complete as believable types, though I have never liked Brian Cox's open-mouthed style (he never quite rings true to me).  But it all seemed a bit too heavy to me, over-done as it is too ultimate and ambitious as a story extravaganza.<br /><br />Overall, warmly recommended.

0307237699|5.0|I was very impressed.  Probably not enough to support him for president (not enough experience), but I sure like the way he thinks and if he were elected I would be very proud.  The negative attacks on Obama and Clinton have already begun.  Between now and November 2008, it is going to get very nasty, I suspect.  We still live in a racist and sexist country, unfortunately. <br /> <br />Obama did not come from wealth.  He grew up in Indonesia.  The family had no car, air conditioning, refrigerator or flush toilets in the house.  His parents sent him to public schools, because they couldn't afford the private schools that most American children attended. <br /> <br />He was extremely lucky to have Alan Keyes as his opponent in 2004.  Keyes is extremely right wing, even though he does have a gay daughter.  Keyes moved to Illinois just to run for Senate.  Actually, Keyes was Obama's second Republican challenger.  The first one dropped out after his divorce records were made public.  Even President Bush said about Keyes, \\"That guy is a piece of work, isn't he?\\"  So Obama really hasn't had a serious opponent while running for a national office. <br /> <br />Obama doesn't consider President Bush a bad man, but as someone who feels he is doing what he thinks is best for the country.  Disagree sure.  That has been my philosophy for many years.  Republicans are not bad people, as such, just misguided.  The vast majority of elected officials,  Democrat or Republican, run for office because they think they can make this country a better place, based on their understanding. <br /> <br />Obama shares my views regarding porn or semi-porn.  Adults seeing porn is one thing, but a child seeing it is something else.  Children should not have the same First Amendment rights as adults.  He mentioned a particular TV show geared towards teens that show young people getting drunk and having fun in a hot tub.  Obama and I feel that the television industry needs to take a more responsible position when it comes to children. <br /> <br />Obama takes his Christian faith very seriously.  He is not one of those Christians, who feel all one needs to do is take Jesus as one's Savior.  Obama is more interested in the mandate of Jesus, that we feed the hungry, heal the sick, bring peace on earth etc.  On the other hand, he realizes we are no longer (if we ever were) a Christian nation.  We are now a Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu nation and even a nation for non-believers.  Assuming Christians were the only religion in this country, who's Christianity would we base our culture on?  The Christianity of Pat Robertson and James Dobson or the Christianity of Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson? <br /> <br />Obama takes offense at those who say that God was banned from our classrooms or that children are prohibited from praying at school.  Neither is the case. Children will continue to pray as long as there are tests to be taken.  A child praying is not the issue; the issue is whether a public employee should lead children in prayer during class time.  Which prayer?  Christian?  Hindu?  Pray to Apollo? <br /> <br />Obama feels that the Sermon on the Mount is more important than an obscure line in Romans.  The Bible may have all kinds of guidelines such as how to treat your slaves, but the most important teachings in the Bible are the teachings of Jesus. <br /> <br />Many Christians say that they hate the sin of homosexuality, but not the sinner.   He says that such a statement still inflicts pain on good people--people who are made in the image of God and who are truer to the message of Jesus than those who condemn them are.  Obama says that gay couples should have the same rights as heterosexual couples.  He is not at a point yet where he can support same sex marriage, but he also acknowledges that he is open to hearing all sides of this issue and might be willing to change his opinion on this. <br /> <br />A must read for all political junkies.  Be sure to read this as well as Living History by Hillary Clinton before making up your mind as to who to support in 2008, <br />

B00005JOQS|1.0|This movie was ridiculous, ridiculously terrible that is. It was much in the vain of the old superman movies, which were alright in their day, but quite out of date today. There is never a real sense of threat, due to the way Bryan Singer and Kevin Spacey portray Lex Luthor. Aside from one little plot twist, and some decent special effects this movie is downright terrible. This movie will make true fans of the series vomit. There is almost no resemblance to the complexity of the mythos. This movie was such a great opportunity to bring back the legacy of superman. It looks like were going to have to wait another twenty years for someone to come along and do it right. Do not see this movie, instead I suggest dusting off some old comics or checking out the television show Smallville.

B000002VQQ|4.0|<br />   I'm writing this review some months after buying this album. I bought the album because it was mentioned in an article about albums you must own. Saw this album really cheap, new, with a vinyl look to the cd. <br /> <br />   Usually I write very long-winded reviews of albums, so this time I'll just write something short, and going on memory. Firstly, I am mostly into pop/rock music. By these standards, there aren't any great/good songs in that mould in this album. This isn't to say that the album is a dud...merely to say that the album should be judged by different criteria to pop/rock. It's also not to say that the artist can't write great songs in the pop/rock mould-she has written a pop/rock masterpiece in \\"Because the night\\". <br /> <br />   So, what is the attraction of this album? To me, it's the poetic, lyrical, scary, weird terrain that it covers. Sure, there are covers, more or less, of well known songs like \\"Gloria\\" [has original lyric input from Smith, I think] and \\"My generation\\", but these songs are not reasons to buy the album...they're probably the weakest links in this album. <br /> <br />   This album could not have been released decades beforehand, I would not think. The sheer weirdness and creepiness of some songs would have seen Patti either sedated or moved into a sanitarium! <br /> <br />   Stand-out songs for me are: \\"Birdland\\" and \\"Land\\", from memory. The former has an interesting lyrical structure and delves into the weird...alien abductions, from memory. \\"Land\\" is the song, from memory, where Patti gives full vent to her weirdness...some of her imagery is quite disturbing and suitable for mature audiences only, I think.  <br /> <br />  These songs, being poetic in nature, make it reasonably opaque as to what the narrative of the song is, apart from having bloody, disturbing imagery on occasion. <br /> <br />   All in all, this album does not have conventionally 'good' songs on it. It's more arty/farty, if I can phrase it that way. I wouldn't listen to this album for specific songs...it's more the kind of album you just plonk on and listen to all the way through...perhaps it's a hot-bath or veg-out listen kind of cd. <br /> <br />   There aren't any conventionally memorable songs on this, but I think I did enjoy songs like \\"Redondo Beach\\" and \\"Free money\\" [apart from the 'worthy' songs like \\"Birdland\\" and \\"Land\\"]. \\"Free money\\" sounds like a Broadway musical song...if there was a Broadway musical called \\"Free money\\", this song would be the theme song! It has the vibe of a song from the musical \\"Cabaret\\". <br /> <br />   Just btb, listening to one song in particular on this album [I don't remember which], it struck me that Patti's vocals reminded me [forget temporal order here] of The Divinyl's Chrissie Amphlett. So, perhaps Chrissie was influenced vocally by Patti. <br /> <br />   Anyway, this is a really good album, it's just not good in a \\"top 40\\" kind of way. If you like experimental, poetic type music, I think you will like this album. It's not weird in a The Beatles' \\"Revolution 9\\" kind of way, but the poetic imagery of Patti is sometimes more weird than The Beatles. <br /> <br />For the musically adventurous. <br />    <br />P.S. seeing as Patti Smith is usually grouped with the punk-rock movement, you may be interested in my reviews of other punk bands, i.e. The Ramones' Anthology and the Australian punk rock band The Saints' anthology entitled \\"Know your product\\". If you like political music check out my reviews of Australian pop/rock group Midnight Oil. Politics never sounded so good.
B0000AI45P|4.0|Review number 57. Originally released in 1977, as this was the first of three 'actual' Television albums. As most fans might tag this debut offering as new wave or punk, it seems to ME that it's more of a guitar rock effort. If anything, this four piece was a major influence on bands to come along after them like Jeff Buckley, U2, Rapture, Echo&the Bunnymen and Sonic Youth. Tunes here I found to show us just what Television was truly capable of were \\"See No Evil\\", \\"Venus\\", the moving title track \\"Marquee Moon\\" and \\"Torn Curtain\\". Line-up: Tom Verlane-guitar,keyboards&vocals, Fred Smith-bass&vocals, Richard Lloyd-guitar and Billy Ficca-drums. Likely to draw in fans of Wire, Suicide, XTC and Blondie.
B0000691U1|5.0|This is one of those albums that transcends the word \\"jazz\\" and reminds me of how useless a term it can be when trying to talk about art music of this quality.  Ellington, Mingus and Roach drove the tap deep into the well of the universal with this one.  Ellington's ability to approach the music with a compositional freshness rather than becoming mired in the formulaic makes Money Jungle a true joy; alive with spontaneity but steeped in jazz tradition.  The instrumental virtuosity of all three working on the scaffold of Ellington's compositional leadership yields a priceless result.  African Flower alone would justify owning this album.

B000001FQ4|4.0|Thin Lizzy went through their first major personnel upheaval at the end of 1973 and times seemed dark for the band. Brief salvation came in the form of Gary Moore, legendary Irish blues guitarist and off again on again running mate of Philip Lynott. As one single was owed to Decca, Gary played on \\"Little Darlin'\\", a fantastic yet rare song that only became available on compliations. Moore also contributed to \\"Still in Love with You\\" which would later become the centerpiece for Lizzy's Vertigo debut 'Nightlife', released in October 1974. As Gary proved only a temporary fit, Philip and Brian recruited not one but two guitarists to broaden out the sound and make the band even more unique than they already were. Eighteen year old Scotsman Brian Robertson and Santa Monica native Scott Gorham came to complete THE classic lineup of Thin Lizzy and 'Nightlife' was THIS band's first. Curiously the record is not indicative of future Robertson/Gorham classics (very little of their trademark harmonies) and therefore is not up to the standard of their future efforts. The album is also one of Lizzy's most stylistically diverse as funk, R&B, folk and hard rock come together as if Philip wanted to expand people's opinions of what this new band could do. My favorites are of course the rock numbers including the opener \\"She Knows\\", which seems to be the self-confession of a heroin addict who needs help from \\"Mother Mary\\". \\"Sha-La-La\\" which features Brian Downey flexing his muscles, later became a concert staple for that very reason, but it also allows the new boys to let it rip in dueling solos. \\"Philomena\\" I have always loved, Phil's tribute to his mom and how he misses her while he's on the road. \\"It's Only Money\\" rocks very convincingly as well with Phil being the tough guy again. \\"Still in Love\\" is great but I think the studio version is overrated. \\"Night Life\\" is kind cool as is \\"Showdown\\", two examples of the R&B influences that Philip put in his writing. Worth it for the Lizzyfan but others may want to buy their later classics as 'Nightlife' may not contain as much rock for the heavy rock fans.

034537410X|4.0|I am a semi-lucid dreamer, i.e., I can access memory of previous dreams while dreaming, but I don't know that I'm dreaming, so I have no control over the content of my dreams. This is a good guide to becoming conscious of your dream life, but it is so boring that it puts me right to sleep. Don't expect to be able to start exploring the world of lucid dreaming without lots of dream work, e.g., keeping a dream diary, looking for triggers in your dreams to alert you to the fact that you are dreaming while dreaming. However, the first time you realize that you've \\"been here, done that\\" in your dreams, you will never dismiss those hours asleep as a waste of time: Every dream becomes way more entertaining that going to the movies.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|The Seeger Sessions is clearly a work that has taken time, contemplation and connection to the past to produce.  Springsteen has shown that he is an artist who will dip his cup into the well and find tresures to share with us all.  His recent journey into the music of Pete Seeger is such an opportunity.  This music seemingly connected with him when he was learning to play his first three chords to make a song; it connected again through his long and diverse career when he began as the E Street front man (think of The River, Wreck on the Highway, Factory); it leapt out and called loudly in Nebraska; and more recently in Ghost of Tom Joad and Devils and Dust.  Springsteen looks to me like an artist that travels far and wide, near and dear, wherever he connects, to find the music that he wants to share with us all.  I just love this recent part of his musical journey for many reasons that I can talk about and a whole bunch more that I can simply feel. <br /> <br />The tracks on this CD take us into a time when music was a political weapon; a time when Seeger's friend Woody Guthrie proclaimed his guitar killed fascists.  It was a time when talking and singing about life and its tough breaks was as natural and easy as breathing in and out in 4 / 4 time.  Springsteen has brought a lyrical interpretation to those tales of the past which brings them fair and square into today.  His message is of things we need to know about today and about things that have been important and unresolved for many years; war, hard work with no let up, the search for grace, the joy of a great tale and the pleasure of a G chord in front of a great band. <br /> <br />As I sit writing this I wonder which musical well Springsteen is drinking at today; as he quietly plans and develops his next artistic expression of life in music.  I reckon it will be maybe Elvis' music from the 1950's or maybe Hank Williams strident laments.  Or maybe something else entirely.  Either way I am enjoying this work andam looking forward to the next place he wants to take us.

B000KCHZK6|3.0|The first time I listened to the CD I heard no obvious singes. Finally, on the second and third listens some of the songs started to emerge as better than others. This is the first CD of songs written or co-written exclusively by Norah. So, this is almost like a restart for her. Jones' first CD was filled with songs by Hank Williams and other less known artists. This CD is good if you break down each song and just isolate them. Do that and there is not a bad song here. The monotony comes when you sit down and listen to the whole thing throughout. The songs just kind of smudge into one another. All the songs have the same tempo and close to the same beat count. I believed that the first Norah CD was 5 stars, the second 4 stars, this CD 3 stars. You see the trend here. An artist that started out so unbelievably good is close to living in oblivion right next door to Hootie and the Blowfish. I don't see this CD staying around the chart long. The good thing about Norah is these songs will be much better live in concert. The problems with this CD are that it does not follow what Jones did before and it seems to be less of a jazz influenced, no diversity in the tempos of the songs, and lacking something lyrically. I am disappointed because Norah is one of my all-time favorite artists and I was expecting more.     Key Songs:    Thinking of You  Be My Somebody  Not Too Late

B000IU3XTM|4.0|Damien let us wait a few years for his sophomore effort and followup to O and it is worth the wait. Mellow yet distorted this may seem uneven, but the CD actually flows like water. Angelic singer Lisa Hannigan hooks up again with Rice and they form a great tandem. The track \\"9 Crimes\\", with Hannigan is an emotional and great composition. Look for many of these tracks to appear in dramatic scenes in movies and TV. Elsewhere, the CD continues to bounce between Amos lee like tempos to Sigur Rios influenced noise. Easily, one of the best CDs of the year.  <br /> <br />Key Tracks: <br /> <br />9 Crimes <br />Rootless Tree <br />Me, My Yoke, and I
0375505091|5.0|I loved this book. In fact I read and looked through it while listening to \\"The Essential Leonard<br /><br />Cohen\\" I was in seventh heaven. The book and the music satisfied so many of my senses. The sun was streaming through the large window, warming me outside , while the book and music warmed me on the inside.Annie Leibovitz, her family and her friends became so human, so touching that I  had great empathy for all of them. I did not realize that Annie had a real life behind all the celebrity stuff. The book is to be treasured.
B000E41MS6|4.0|All in all, this is a fantastic regeneration of a classic TV series, and it's nice to have the \\"Doctor Who\\" saga continuing after such a long and unfortunate lapse. Still, as anyone familiar with the show knows, the Doctor is always disoriented and weakened immediately after he regenerates, and the same must be admitted of this first season. It's still better than much of what passes for entertainment nowadays, and I liked it a lot, but it must be admitted that it falls somewhat short of its full potential and of what longtime followers of the renegade Time Lord's adventures have come to expect.<br /><br />Christopher Eccleston's rendition of the Doctor is a compelling one, and he brings a real screen presence and charisma to the role. He's taken on the much beloved eccentricity, lighthearted wackiness, and comforting sense of justice of the character and alloyed it with a bitter sense of sarcasm and a short temper in a convincing fashion (with a streak of arrogance reminiscent of William Hartnell's original Doctor). It's a tough balance to strike, but he manages quite well and gives us a Doctor who is very much alien but very much likeable.<br /><br />The Doctor's companion Rose is also a nice, believable character with a more active role in the stories and a life outside the Tardis--the effects upon both oneself and one's family & friends of whisking oneself away from one's everyday grind and traveling time and space with a cosmic hobo is explored here in a way unprecedented in \\"Doctor Who\\" history and I found it refreshingly realistic and original. Even if it all does get a bit \\"domestic\\" sometimes.<br /><br />However, while it's all fine and well to give the show a faster pace in line with contemporary sensibilities and frankly wonderful to endow it with the production values it's always deserved (i.e. cool special effects), the heart of \\"Doctor Who\\" has always been in the excellent quality of its science fiction storytelling, and that's the part that's really shaky and unsteady here. Actually, the first three stories are truly excellent and well-told, but the quality starts gradually dropping off from there (with peaks nonetheless, like \\"Dalek\\" and \\"The Empty Child\\"). Many of the stories seem a bit rushed and slapdash, with crisis resolutions annoyingly sudden and unprepared for, like rabbits pulled out of a magician's hat. The worst offender on the latter score transpires in the otherwise exciting and promising season finale, where we get a very literal (!) \\"Deus ex Machina\\" solution--c'mon folks, even the ancient Greeks got tired of that one.<br /><br />Still, I'm willing to chalk these shortcoming up to regeneration disorientation. Overall, the show is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable, and it's nice to have the ride of a lifetime (or nine lifetimes, rather) back on the road again.Actually, the first three stories are truly excellent and well-told, but the quality starts gradually dropping off from there (with peaks nonetheless, like \\"Dalek\\" and \\"The Empty Child\\").

1843104954|5.0|I have read lots of books on AS and reviewed many of them. What I am always warning is that in most cases any one book never gives a complete picture.<br /><br />Tony Attwood's book though is about as complete a picture as you could get right now and is not only far superior to his first guide to the subject but to many others on the market.<br /><br />If you read just one book on AS this should be it. It is easy to read, packed with information, and the author's respect and appreciation for people with Asperger's is evident on every page.<br /><br />It's professional, it's factual, it's understanding, it's worth owning a copy.

I highly recommend this book to anybody even to those who believe \\"you cannot teach an old dog new tricks.\\" You can't help but feel those God Breezes that Flylady speaks of in her book. Flylady is that breath of fresh air my musty cluttered house needed. And I am forever thankful.
0060512806|4.0|I came to this book as my second Stephenson novel after Snow Crash, and I read that one the first time when I was in junior high.  Cryptonomicon was a daunting looking book, but the character development and interesting mix of stories kept me involved to the end.  Like other Stephenson books, this one contains a lot of technological excerpts, mostly about math and code breaking, and these can be a pain to get through, but it also contains some of the most realistically human writing of any author.  My only concern was the end.  I was hoping that after all of that investment, there would be a more realistic ending.  After a thousand pages worth of buildup, the ending seemed to be tacked on and all too short.  Despite this, if you are a techno nerd who also enjoys an engaging view of WWII history, this is a book for you.
0385040253|4.0|This book is considered by many to be THE reference for knots.  Most professional Navy Boatswains Mates I know own this book and use it regularly.  Although the instructions can be difficult to follow for the beginner, there is enough material to keep the decorative knot-tier going for a long time.  The background material is interesting as well.  An invaluable reference for the professional seaman or boy scout.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Good album. She is definitely an artist. I mean she started her album with \\"Like a Star\\". Anybody else would have opened with \\"Put Your Records On\\". When she starts singing \\"Like a Star\\" I was like, \\"Okay...LOL\\" ...But by time she got to \\"I don't argue like this, with anyone but you...we do it all the time\\" I was totally captured. Beautiful song! Her songs have more mood than melody to me, but that's not a bad thing. You could play it in the background and then your ears get caught in a beautiful arrangement like I was with \\"Like a Star\\". Anyway this album would make a good gift for lovers of neo-soul, smooth R&B, and lyrical pop.  <br />Oh and also check out Jill Scott's new album \\"Jill Scott Collaborations\\" (best soul/R&B album of the year so far). <br />
B0001ENY6M|5.0|For me the most inspiring track is \\"Resurrection\\". I remember the day that I saw this movie for the first time almost 3 years ago. My friend and I stayed until the end of the credits only to listen to this track. It's my candidate for best final scene in a movie. Now , 'Resurrection\\" (as the rest of the album) is  in my Creative Zen Vision M and I listen to this beautiful piece of music everyday. It's really inspiring. Buy it!!!  P.S. There are so many Jews here and there writing a lot of negative reviews  about this soundtrack and the movie. Don't pay any atention to that. This soundtrack and the movie are masterpieces.

IN A FEW OF HER REMIXES WAS HARD TO TELL WHICH SONG WAS TILL SHE STARTED SINGING IT OR A CERTAIN SOUND DISTINGUISED THE SONG ORIGINALLY. IT WAS ALL DANCING & ENTERTAINING!!

B000F0UUIM|5.0|THE SEARCHERS is perhaps John Ford's best Western and perhaps his best film. John Wayne's obsessive Ethan Edwards is one of his best roles. John Wayne is Ethan Edwards playing the character and embellishing him with just enough Wayne-isms to set this returning ex-Confederate apart from the rest of the community. Wayne's Ethan Edwards is characterized by an intense sense of stoicism and strong individuality required of this enigmatic and complex man. Upon his return from the war the Comanches destroy what family he has and it is unclear if Wayne is acting out his hatred of the Indians or simply avenging his loss as he begins his quest to rescue his niece, Debbie. Wayne is accompanied by his half breed nephew Martin, portrayed by effectively by Jeffrey Hunter, on his quest which continually reveals Wayne's contempt for the Indians. The quest and anticipation of what Wayne will do when and if they find Debbie is an emotional journey for the characters and viewer.

There is such a pile of macho manure in this film that you need a snorkel.<br /><br />Arrogance runs so rampant across the screen that you can't tell the good guys from the bad in this movie. I remember when heroes had a little humility. That's what gave them staying power. Look at the likeable Indiana Jones that Harrison Ford created. Even look at the characters in the MUMMY. In that film even the villain had his moment of pathos and he even got to come back in the sequel! I'll tell you, that mummy was no dummy. Lara, you are out of your league. It was great to see Richard Johnson on the big screen once again on this film's theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Thanks Richard.

B00004VXWJ|4.0|I was watching the TV remake of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN a few weeks ago. For me it had no resemblance to the original 1960 film but instead looked like it was made from a blueprint from 1985's SILVERADO right down to the acting, costumes and production design. When I saw SILVERADO in the summer of 1985 I was not entirely pleased. It was directed, co-scripted and produced by Lawrence Kasdan. Kasdan had scripted RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and beautifully captured and updated the adventure film genre from the 1940s. However, Kasdan did not direct RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. I feel that the look and experience of RAIDERS is really more the results of Spielberg's direction and visual approach to the script, not to mention the perfect casting of Ford as Indiana Jones. Unlike Spielberg's film, SILVERADO under Kasdan's direction looks more like a product of the 80s the decade in which it was directed. SILVERADO is not a bad film and in fact it is rather a unique one. It seems to have not influenced or spawned any future cinematic Westerns in the traditional sense of any great consequence. In fact UNFORGIVEN and DANCES WITH WOLVES which followed were two Westerns that went on to win the Oscars for Best Picture of their Year. These are both complete inversions of SILVERADO being more psychological and sociological studies of the Westward movement and experience. SILVERADO is an updated homage to the myth of the American West. SILVERADO is a very entertaining film and it did help rejuvenate interest in the Western but not in Kasdan's vision. The heroes Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and Kevin Costner were very good. Rosanna Arquette, John Cleese, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt and Jeff Fahey were also good. The one performance that was critically overlooked was Jeff Goldblum as Slick. One normally does not associate Goldblum as a bad guy with the exception of his role as a sleazy street hood in the original DEATH WISH. There is no sleaze here. Goldblum in SILVERADO is definitely slick and a very smooth villain. One of the film's greatest and enduring assets was the score composed by Bruce Broughton. Broughton's score was a larger than life rousing tribute to the American Western. It's brilliant and very moving. When you look at Jerry Gatlin's stunts and Carol Littleton's and Mia Goldman's editing of John Bailey's cinematography combined with Broughton's score you are witnessing some great stand-up-and-cheer moments. Today I enjoy SILVERADO much better than when I first saw it. Like life in general, you never know where the good old days are until you think back on them.ick and a very smooth villain.

0393327655|5.0|Dear Sam, <br /> <br />I extend my most heartfelt congratulations on the writing and publishing of The End of Faith. As a philosophy undergraduate, thirty-something parent of a daughter born into an unnecessarily dangerous world, and as a lifelong seeker of more pragmatic solutions to humanity's ills beyond the infantile and counterproductive doctrines of mainstream religion, your book is unequivocally one of the best I have ever read. <br /> <br />The End of Faith is an urgent, clarion call for us all to wake up from this collective slumber; a common sense exhortation to jump off a runaway train before it hits the wall towards which it is hurtling. <br /> <br />I read disparaging reviews on Amazon and other places that claim things such as \\"[Harris'] heart is not really in the book's latter chapters\\" and that the book \\"bites off more than it can chew\\"; quotes which in hindsight are nothing if not amusing. The book's final chapter is exhilirating, and the only people who might have trouble chewing its contents are those whose teeth have been retarded by dogma and bigotry. <br /> <br />Well done Sam Harris! Please keep writing. <br />

0805076476|5.0|This wasn't a perfect book, but it was a perfect premise.  Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk is one of those gems of literature which make good on a fantastic theme and becomes remarkably popular without sacrificing to any cookie cutter formula.<br /><br />The thing that either works for the reader, or doesn't work for the reader is the voice.  Palahniuk's narrator is the voice of frustration, a man who so despises what he has to do for a living because it benefits no one and he sees society as a rotting wasteland inhabited by pointless people leading pointless lives all working to destroy each other, build nothing and make Gods out of the wealthy.  His satire is to show that the things we really crave - empowerment, validation, strength, soul - are being cast aside in favor of placebos like material goods, support groups, drugs, and entertainment.  His argument that the power structure is upside down is dramatically symbolized by the Fight Club, where the most powerful are those with nothing left to lose.<br /><br />He explores sanity and leaves the question unanswered  - is mental illness really a problem or just a coping mechanism?  Maybe the whole country is mentally ill and those who aren't are willing to make a stand, support anarchism, and subsequently are viewed as abnormal.  Would the hunter of ancient times be in Fight Club?  What have we become?<br /><br />There are problems with some details, like the manufacturing process of soap and the technical details of explosives . . . but it works, I can get past all that for a great voice and a strong message.  This book had both.<br /><br />- CV Rick
6305535264|3.0|Saturn 3, while certainly not the best of films, does not deserve all of the bashing it gets. This film is sort of a \\"Fatal Attraction\\" meets the \\"Terminator\\" even though Saturn 3 was released years prior.   I really enjoyed this film. The \\"atmosphere\\" of the movie was very convincing and almost literally transports the viewer to the third moon of Saturn.  Yes, the movie has it's flaws. Farrah Fawcett is a terrible actress. She always was. But, then again, this '70s icon was never chosen for roles because of her acting ability, which, unfortunately, seems to be so commonplace in Hollywood.   Harvey Keitel, one of my favorite actors, does seem to give a very wooden performance, but that is probably due to the fact that the director did not like his Brooklyn accent and had all of his lines dubbed in by a British actor. Also, I think his character was meant to be dead-pan and wooden to reflect the current socialogical aspects of Earth's society (apparently, Earth is an overcrowded and socially bankrupt planet, much like it is today!).  The special effects are subpar when compared to similar sci-fi flicks of that time, but that is part of its charm. The effects, while slightly substandard, are still very eye-catching.  The story itself if very original. The idea of a robot becoming sexually obsessed with a woman just like his master and unable to fulfill his unnatural desires is executed in a logical and suspenseful way. The set design and costumes are also well done. The robot Hector, though, does seem to be designed rather oddly. That is probably due to the fact that a suit had to be built that could house a rather large-framed actor inside of it.  All in all, Saturn 3 is worth a look. Fans of sci-fi and thrillers should find this to be an excellent escape. I, for one, am glad to see that this movie is still around and available for purchase.

Being a huge Pierce Brosnan fan, I was disappointed when we learned he would not be back in the role.  Sure the last couple Bond films have been boring & stupid (invisible car anyone)?  Surely Quentin Tarantino could have given Brosnan some decent material to work with!! <br />Well, not only did Daniel Craig make me forget how much I missed Brosnan, he now OWNS the role.  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bond in this picture.  As for the movie, it is sensational.  The action scenes are intense.  The acting is superb (including the lovely Eva Green).  But most importantly the story is engaging.  Now you can see it all in high definition on Blu-ray!!  For the first time in a long time, I can't wait for the next Bond film.  James Bond will be back.

B00004LN16|3.0|After the last Ac/Dc release 'Ballbreaker' I was truly hoping for a comeback album in the league of 'The Razors Edge' but instead they released 'Stiff Upper Lip'...to be fair when I heard the first single on the radio the awesome title track 'Stiff Upper Lip' I was very encouraged,this song is right up there at the top of any list of great Ac/Dc songs,which I have noticed that the band has done since the very beginning,they have always put their strongest songs in the first couple spots on an album (with the only exception being the amazing 'Back In Black' where every song shines equally)<br />on this release,they follow 'Stiff Upper Lip' with a very cool shift in tempo 'Meltdown' it took me a few listens to really get into this song and I figured out why,it is a total shift from their normal style,this one grooves with subtlety,I like it and it lets the band breathe a little...the next song 'House Of Jazz' just plain confuses me,the music is rather dull and mundane but the lyrics have left me pondering why one of the world's greatest hard rock bands would write a song titled 'House Of Jazz' the chorus offers no explanation \\"welcome to the house of welcome to the house of welcome to the house of jazz\\" I suppose I'll never know the answer,it's a strange song and feels really out of place...this is followed by the albums high point 'Hold Me Back' which truly kicks serious [..],it has a beat that almost dares you to not get up and move what you got on a dance floor,the beginning guitar notes remind you a little bit of 'Sink The Pink' (one of my favorite Ac/Dc songs ever) the song builds up slowly and is just awesome,it keeps your foot tapping the whole way through...this is followed by 'Safe In New York City',okay,in the past I have cut them some slack because they are one of the only bands to stick to their guns and not change styles to fit the trends,I respect that,but this song has to be just about the dumbest lyrics I've ever heard,they just got lazy and didn't even try,listen to the chorus..they just didn't try,it just repeats the same phrase over and over and it makes no sense...this is followed by another great song 'Can't Stand Still' which is similar in feel to 'Hold Me Back' a great song that really makes you want to get up and dance,I love this one,from there 'Can't Stop Rock And Roll' perhaps one of the heaviest songs on the CD,this one is classic Ac/Dc and is similar to the feel of the 'Back In Black' album...'Satellite Blues' is okay,nothing that we haven't heard before but isn't awful,this is followed by 'Damned' which is pretty cool,a different kind of vibe but that's nice,this CD doesn't get as dull and boring as the last release 'Ballbreaker' did...this is followed by 'Come And Get It' now I really like this song,it has atmosphere and is very catchy and has a different feel from anything else on the CD,you can tell they did put effort into trying to make the songs sound different from one another...of course the curse of Ac/Dc albums is almost always the last couple songs are the worst and this is no exception...'All Screwed Up' and 'Give It Up' are not memorable at all and I find myself looking at the track numbers to see when the CD will end...over all this is not a bad CD,it's much better then the last release and much better then 'Blow Up Your Video' but it's more then a little uneven<br /><br />the upside - the band really went for some different feels on this CD,some great classic tunes are included here 'Stiff Upper Lip' 'Hold Me Back' 'Can't Stand Still' and 'Come And Get It' being my personal favorites<br /><br />the downside - lots of filler...and the overall production feels like the band was in a very small room,there is no space to it,it is lacking the tones that previous albums had,it sounds as if the recording equipment was completely different from past releases which is not really the band's fault but it does effect the listening experience<br /><br />the bottom line - definitely worth having,especially if you are a true fan,'Stiff Upper Lip' and 'Hold Me Back' alone are worth buying this,however if you are looking for the classic Ac/Dc sound look elsewhere...people new to the band should start with 'Back In Black' 'Highway To Hell' and 'Dirty Deeds' and then move on to the rest of the catalog...this is a big step forward from 'Ballbreaker' but falls far short of their past glories...I really hope they release another big comeback CD like 'The Razors Edge' or 'Fly On The Wall' I have a feeling this great band as at least one more classic album left in them....Donutman says so!!!an,'Stiff Upper Lip' and 'Hold Me Back' alone are worth buying this,however if you are looking for the classic Ac/Dc sound look elsewhere...people new to the band should start with 'Back In Black' 'Highway To Hell' and 'Dirty Deeds' and then move on to the rest of the catalog...this is a big step forward from 'Ballbreaker' but falls far short of their past glories...I really hope they release another big comeback CD like 'The Razors Edge' or 'Fly On The Wall' I have a feeling this great band as at least one more classic album left in them....Donutman says so!!!

0380713802|1.0|I have enjoyed several of Bryson's books in the past so finally got around to this tour of Europe; I'm sorry I did. This is like one man's mid-life crisis dream of re-living an adolescent fantasy journey, with little real thought about the people in the places he visits. Sources for drink--often LOTS of drink--and the occasional museum are the primary focus of his entire journey, and the xenophobic comments that pass for humor here get very old very quickly. <br /> <br />Probably the saddest part of the entire book was being reminded that less than 20 years ago, he could visit Sarajevo and watch families playing quietly in a park. For anyone like me who is just now considering reading this, don't. There are far better, more current travel books and far better Bryson books out there, so do yourself a favor and skip this one.

0349106746|4.0|Tuchman's \\"Folly\\" surveys four episodes in history - distinct in culture, chronlogy and geography but otherwise united in folly by the ruling leadership. Folly, as sess it, is policy pursued by leaders \\"contrary to self-interest\\". The problem for these leaders is that self-interest is often confused with selfishness - short-term benefits taking precedence over the longterm (or even when the benefits are illusory - with each episode displaying just outright stupidity).  The Trojans greet Greeks bearing gifts; The renaissance Papacy provokes a protest; the British lose America and America loses Vietnam. In each of Tuchman's episodes, man's leadership not only trails his advances in science and the arts, but is actually inverse in relation - civilization takes a few thousand years to put a man on the moon, but hasn't yet developed a genuine government on Earth.  <br /> <br />Works like \\"Folly\\" could easily fail based on prose (another boring history book!?) or if there are flaws in the overall analysis.  But Tuchman excels on both counts.  Not as in-depth as \\"Distant Mirror\\" (with its encyclopedic survey of the 13th century), \\"Folly\\" makes its point with razor-sharp clarity and Tuchman's prose are crisp and inviting. \\"Folly\\", for its thinness manages to find common ground in different eras and different forms of self-inflicted harm. Active, if ill-informed policy-making mires America in Vietnam, while the Trojans all but knock down their walls to make way for that gift-horse. On the flip side, British policy in the colonies seems clumsy, indicating that those for or against the colonies were incapable of formulating a cogent policy - the bane of a purely parliamentary system. Most lamentable (also the most entertaining), is the case of the renaissance popes. The Papacy raises an interesting issue, because the thesis requires the policy to issue from governments that choose the wrong course despite their capacity to go the right way - excluding \\"terminally corrupt regimes\\" like the Tsars and the KMT.  Though the era of its folly (for purposes of the book) only spans the rule 6 popes over about 60 years (Sixtus IV - Clement VII), it's hard to fathom an analysis that allows for that leadership's capacity to lead.  Among the myriad failings of each of the renaissance Popes was their habitual stacking of the College of Cardinals.  Nepotism wasn't new before the reign of Sixtus, but in raising it to new heights held as an example by his successors, he set the Papacy into a cruel cycle.  The stacked College chose successive popes who only were able to stack the College again.  Being at once the product of the college of cardinals and also the architect of its new generation, the renaissance popes can do no more than prolong a corrupted system that bestowed upon them the papal tiara. Of the six popes cited, three actively pursue policy - while the remaining can do no more than continually tax christendom (especially the disunited German states), pursue confused alliances, arrange for lavish parties and deplete papal reserves. Under Tuchman's definition, self-harming policy is too inclusive of leadership incapable of forming policy. The corruption that bred the renaissance papacy was clearly endemic to the church of that era - with greed and manipulation of religion hardly limited to the seat of St. Peter - so it's hard to fault the popes. Tuchman clearly understands when recounting the reproach given to the future Leo X, that, were the Cardinals better men, they'd elect better popes, and \\"all men would be better for it\\". Unfortunately, as Tuchman notes, the Renaissance Cardinals could not be better men because they were chosen by the poor popes to begin with, while the Popes are stymied by the fact that they were chosen by an earlier generation of imperfect cardinals. How Rome broke this cycle, vindicating Tuchman by proving the papacy capable of doing so, gets too little shrift. In fact, the renaissance papacy, while corrupt, was also remarkably tolerant, and the reformation that it bred held dire consequences in terms of war and religious persecution of the Jews, every bit as painful as the machivellian schemeing of the pre-protestant papacy. It's all exasperating, heart-breaking and entertaining, but one wonders whether these episodes should have gotten their own book.  In short, this tale of folly is a masterpiece.
0446528056|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has produced yet another great story.  This was a terrific read...I highly recommend it.
B000J103PC|2.0|My wife insisted on renting this movie, despite my opposition.  Was my oppositon to it justified in the end?  I believe so.  This got two stars instead of one because the acting was actually pretty good, but this movie, as many reviewers have already classified it, is a chick flick and only served to personify the stereotypical superficiality that seems to be idolized by so many in our society.  Granted, the main character 'learns her lesson' in the end (big surprise!), about half way through the movie I couldn't standy any of the characters any more.  (slight spoiler to the handful who didn't guess the plot before seeing it) The movie follows a young girls descent from a kind, caring college grad looking for a job to a materialistic, backstabbing, stuck up [..], and back again.  If you're a fan of Sex and the City, you will most likely enjoy this movie, but, considering I despise that show as well, this movie was definitely not for me.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Chevy Chase did a great job in this movie as well as most of the cast.  Not many slow places except for maybe when he is in the attic.  An unfortunate amount of bad language which makes it not kid friendly and a few scenes they could have done without. Overall a really funny movie.
B0000214F0|5.0|An experiment that any adult fan of cult films must have in his or her collection.  Do not get the edited \\"R\\" version.  The original is basically Hollywood actors mixing with the late 70's porn world.
B00005JPDJ|3.0|THE HOLIDAY may be last Christmas' most charming screen saver, boosting a spellbinding cast and a lovely LA/English country production set, however, the story and matters of heart therein are just plain ordinary and a little boring for this age of increasingly creative screenwriting.<br /><br />If you must have some great expectation, like I had with all due respect, for director Nancy Mayers, do sit back and enjoy this almost two-and-a-half endearing but somewhat corny drama - which I think it's deliberately extended with too much bed talking especially between the characters of Diaz and Law - but there won't be any magical (onscreen) chemistry here, certainly not anything like the uniqueness of Nicholson and Keaton in SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE.<br /><br />Regardlessly, Kate Winslet is stunning and emerging like a blossoming English rose. She's very likely to be one of the screen goddesses of our time for many years to come.

One will find it hard to read this book and not want to make changes in their lifestyle, also you will look at information dispensed by the people responsible for guarding our health with a more critical eye. The book is a compilation of numerous scientific studies, is written for people who tend to think logically and contains over 700 references to related studies.
B000059HB7|5.0|Rio Bravo is a 5-star classic Western film for many reasons. First, it has an all-star cast, led by the Duke himself. Second, it tells a classic Western tale. John Wayne and his buddies put a \\"bad guy\\" in jail and have to ward off his creepy friends who are trying to break him out. Lastly, it has some classic gun fight scenes. I watched this film with my two boys, and they loved the ending.<br /><br />If you like Westerns, or John Wayne, you will love this movie. It is definitely a guys movie to enjoy.

B000065VB0|5.0|If you listen closely to this album. Peter told the drummers to take away their (mostly Phil Collins as guest drummer) cymbals and it gives this record a unique sound and invented the \\"Phil Collins\\" sound before Phils Face Value. My only complaint on the album is Dick Morriseys saxophone sticks out like a sore thumb in this music.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|The story is of 2 ranch hands that work hearding sheep on Brokeback Mountain for a summer in the 60's.<br />Though homosexuality was taboo back then, Jack Twist (Jake Gylenhaal) and Enis DelMar (Heath Ledger) are drawn to each other, and become lovers this particular summer.<br /><br />When Summer is over, they must part ways, and Enis tells Jack he is about to be married to his fiance' (Michelle Williams)<br />The following summer Jack checks back in at Brokeback to see if Enis had come back again for the summer. He hasn't, So Jack Twist goes on reluctantly with his life, and he also gets married (More for financial reasons than love)  4 years pass.<br /><br />Jack writes a letter to Enis saying he will be there for a visit. When he shows, all those old feelings resurface, and they head back to Brokeback, and it continues that way throughout the years, and through the years Enis rejects the idea of settling down together as a couple because of a gay-hate killing he saw as a child.<br /><br />The movie moves along nicely, to show the ups and downs of not only thier relationship, but thier relationships to others, thier friends and families throughout the years.<br /><br />There is a very heartfelt ending to this movie that I won't give away, but it will leave you thinking about \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" long after it is over.<br /><br />The acting is phenominal, the setting is beautiful, and the directing is flawless. One of my favorite movies of all time.

0783225725|3.0|Like an unearthed fossil, this movie takes you back to the early '70s, when sadism and amorality seemed \\"cool\\" and \\"relevant\\", rather than just the symptoms of a dying civilization. Clint's thousand yard glare was never more effective or enigmatic. The music sounds like it came from an Amsterdam hash house, creepy and whiny like the spaced out Euro jazz I used to listen to.<br /><br />If you like your heroes anti, and your violence casual and senseless, this is your movie.

039397751X|2.0|Sense and  Sensibility is a work of wit intelligence  and genius--the critical apparatus and here I mean the work of modern critics is the work of those \\"favored\\" by stupidity. With the exception of Raymond Williams important article from \\"Keywords\\" --the critics are informed by a feminism that might be called Sexual Stalinism. Critics with agendas are always reductive, unreflective and in the case of one essay unpardonably vulgar. I name no names. William Empson's exploration of \\"Sense\\" \\"Sensibility\\" \\"Candour\\" and \\"Candid\\" which are briliantly investigated in his Structure of Complex  Words apparenty was not deemed worthy of making the cut. Jane Austen would have had a good laugh had she read the sanctimonious essays that befoul this edition. If you are a good reader trust your own responses and get another edition. Of course if you are a member of the academy this edition is indispensable.

Very cute, good ending, kind of left you hanging, but I think this will be the first of a series, she introduced some characters that have story lines worth pursuing.  Worth buying to read during these long drab winter days.
B00006AW2O|5.0|Strong 2nd album in the U.S. and proof that they were not just another British invasion flash in the pan. The Stones are the Beatles ugly cousin and proud of it. Around and Around is their best rockin Chuck Berry cover only to be found here.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I have been waiting almost a decade since the Book Of Secrets was released for another one of Loreena's albums to be released. This one is deffinatly worth the wait. Book of Secrets used to be my favorite album of hers, now this one is on there on the tops as one of her best albums.  <br /> <br />For this CD, Loreena Mckennit once again has pulled inspirations from all different cultures and countries. The music takes you on a journey from Ireland, Turkey and The sands of the Sahara. It uses diverse instruments from all around the world, from the middle east, to Sweden to Ireland and even some medieval instruments like the hurdy gurdy. It is accompanied by her beautiful poetric words. The music is haunting and the words beautiful, <br /> <br />One of my favorite songs is Caravanserai, which tells the story of a traveling caravan in beautiful poetry middle eastern instruments. Another is Penelope's song, a hauntingly beautiful love song inspired the character Penelope from Homer's odessy. Never Ending Road is a beautiful celtic/irish inspired piece.The English Ladye And The Knight is a piece reminicast of Dante's Prayer on Book of Secrets, but in someways more haunting and more beautiful, it tells the story of a English Lady and her lover her goes on the Crusades.Sacred Shabbat is a piece inspired by Jewish music from Turkey. <br /> <br />This CD to me is a jewel, and is a must have for any Loreena Mckennit fan, or anyone who enjoys beautiful world music. It combines the sounds that Book of Secrets emboided, but retains some of the sounds of her earlier albums as well.

0751532711|5.0|This is a classic work that probably doesn't need my two cents worth of comments; however, I have learned so much from the Rich Dad series that I felt a need to contribute.     One of the key lessons I learned in this book is how to distinguish between liabilities and assets. Assets create a positive flow of cash into your pocket each month, while liabilities take money out of your pocket. According to this definition, your home loan is a liability. Kiyosaki does a great job encouraging his readers to come to terms with their financial literacy and to recognize that as an employee you are earning income that typically falls into the highest tax brackets of any income source. Kiyosaki wantsa you to build multiple streams of income in areas that provide passive and portfolio income. The book is easy to read and highly entertaining as well as informative.    I would also recommend you read \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" by Napoleon Hill and \\"The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth\\" by Phillip Collinsworth.
B000000W5L|5.0|THey made this double album in France in Keiths mansion as tax exiles.   It holds up as probably the best and worst set of songs the Stones will ever release, but it all WORKS as a great 90 minutes of enjoyable hard rock sludge
B000F5GNX8|4.0|this movie is full of fast paced witty diallog (val kilner is amazing as the sarcasticly witty gay perry). And for it's snappy dialog it is well worth whatching. But it also trys to show the drak side of life in hollywood, and in this it also suceeds. But be prepared to suspend disbelife, as in many ways it becomes so ridculous false that I found myself annoyed by how blantley ridiculous some things were(like the idea that the female lead and robert downey jr. went to school together). But the film also lacks something else to make quite the classic it could have been. However all in all an excelent movie that i highly recomend.
B000L22WTO|4.0|Errr... It never ceases to amaze me how people can work themselves up into such a rage over a MUSIC RECORDING. Don't get me wrong.. music is a huge part of my life and I love it very much, but dude.. maintain. Hating someone you disagree with is only useful if you are a fundamentalist terrorist. There will always be people who are rich and do not deserve to be.. way of the world. As for the music, which a \\"review\\" is supposed to address, it is very nice. Having long-time Barrett nut Bowie perform the vocals was a great idea, as he knows just how to handle the quirkier aspects of Syd's very english lyrics. The mix is great for a live recording, too. A lovely tribute.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|In this movie a young jew goes on a quest to find the women who saved his grandfathers and along the way learns about himself and his companies,  a ukranine with a command of english that is very entertaining and his bigoted grandfather. This movie is sweet, funny, and quarky, but at the same time deeply thought provoking and deep. In an odd way whatching this movie is more like reading a book than it's whatching a movie. All in all a beautiful and enjoyable film.

B000FQJAIW|3.0|I last I got both the original version and the special edition on DVD. Somthing I dislike of this version of the lack of special features in both disc. Other thing, for Latin American customers, I regret that both DVD don't have Spanish Subtitles, so we have no choice but heard both version in Spanish. The Original version have dubbed on Spanish from Spain(no popular in latin american people) and the Special Edition is dubbed in Spain from Mexico.<br /><br />I have never the idea of Lucas to change one more his original trilogy of Star Wars. He neither change the dialogue between the Emperador and Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back, nor replaced Sebastian Shaw as Anakin Skywalker by Hayden Christensen in The Return of the Jedi.

B0000A4GAK|5.0|Soul Serenade (Columbia) by the Derek Trucks Band is one of the best albums I have heard this year(2003). It won't matter how this album is classified, either, because it has it all. For those who liked Allman Brothers guitarist Trucks on his eponymous band's major-label debut, 2002's Joyful Noise, will find this CD to be even more impressive. Soul Serenade was actually recorded three years ago, before Joyful Noise, but is being released only now. It's been worth the wait because the Derek Trucks Band is hitting on all cylinders from start to finish.<br /><br />The album begins with covers from two musical music legends-King Curtis and Bob Marley. Trucks uses \\"Soul Serenade\\" by Curtis and \\"Rasta Man Chant\\" by Marley to deliver one of the more exhilarating musical moments of the year. Trucks' guitar-sling and the fine work of his band show that the difference between the rock-steady beat of Jamaican reggae and Afro-American soul is so slight that it hardly matters. The next track, \\"Bock to Bock,\\" is even better. Bassist Todd Smallie and drummer Yonrico Scott set the table for the band to deliver a powerful yet subtle swinging blues number. Trucks is on the case with his ax, and his band stays tight and focused at all times, letting the guitarist roam where he needs. The magic of this album doesn't end there although the first two songs will leave you awestruck.<br /><br />The Derek Trucks Band then pumps the soul classic \\"Drown in My Own Tears,\\" with Gregg Allman providing a heavy, blues-drenched vocal, which is followed by a tricky version of Mongo Santamaria's \\"Afro Blue.\\" By this point you will have no doubt about the importance of Derek Trucks and his band. They defy category. They challenge those preconceived conclusions that often muzzle music, and they will leave you wondering why this album had been held up for so long.<br /><br />-Brian Gilmore
6305736650|5.0|This is a no-brainer.  The only thing debatable about this flick is it's placement in the pantheon of the greatest flicks of all-time.  Personally, as far as it's place in the Bogart canon, I rank \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" above \\"Casablanca\\".  That's not to diminish the film but it just goes to show what an impressive body of work Bogart left behind.  There's more quotable dialogue here this side of Tarantino.  Snappy dialogue wouldn't work if you didn't have the right actors delivering it.  Aside from Bogart and Ingrid Bergman the supporting ensemble on hand here(Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, et al.) seemed to have been plucked from heaven.  Essential is an understatement when describing \\"Casablanca\\".

0486408434|5.0|This is the best book to start in card magic. Small, easy to follow, full of information. After you read this book, you will be able to understand the description of most tricks to learn, and also, you will surprise yourself figuring out tricks just to look at someone performing it.

B00008NRL8|1.0|The Gotan Project were going to perform in Sydney, Australia in January. I had never heard of them, but loving tango music, I decided to buy this recording to test the music before booking for the live performance. And what did I hear? An unimaginative electronic rhythm beat, recorded too loud in comparison with the rest of the instruments, a colourless female singer, an outstanding bandeneon player (whom you could hardly hear over the electronic beat), works that have hardly any tunes - just a change in harmonies, with frequent overtones of other tango composers. Terrible! The only 'reasonable' piece was the last one by Piazzolla from the film 'Sur' - but the performance by the male singer on the 'Sur' CD puts this the dull female to shame. Needless to say, I did not book for the live performance, and gave the CD away to a person I do not particularly like.
B00005JP9V|5.0|Of all the cinema's many apocalypse films, never have I seen one so profoundly cynical and melancholy as Alfonso Cuaron's CHILDREN OF MEN.  Adapted from popular novelist P.D. James' one departure from her usual mysteries, the film is set in 2027, where the world is speedily falling into mass chaos.  Humankind can no longer reproduce, and as the lead character, Theo (Clive Owen), remarks, \\"All of this [humanity] will be gone in seventy years.\\"  The one society that remains relatively kempt is Britain, where Theo attempts to evade the frequent terrorist attacks and assaults from savage bands of the homeless.  One day Theo is reunited with his old flame, Julian (Julianne Moore), now the leader of a terrorist organization.  Julian needs papers to escort a young woman across the border; Theo reluctantly agrees to get the papers and escort the young woman, but finds that his role is far more important than he could ever have dreamed when he learns just what the young woman is carrying. <br /> <br />CHILDREN OF MEN is more than likely the finest of all apocalyptic films, surpassing even such classics as MAD MAX and its sequel, MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR.  While those films had impressive-enough craftmanship to give them considerable cult appeal, they lack the artistry of CHILDREN OF MEN.  This is due completely to Cuaron and the highly-talented cast, which also includes the surprisingly menacing Chiwetel Ejiofor and the always delightful Michael Caine as a gas-passing, pot-smoking Lennon-esque character.  Cuaron made a name for himself with the erotic Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and the magical HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, but CHILDREN OF MEN is unarguably his masterpiece. <br /> <br />Cuaron succeeds wonderfully in the dramatic sense, inspiring absolutely top-notch performances from all the actors.  Owen, as usual, is simply marvelous.  As the film begins, he's unquestionably the antihero, but by the film's end he has become a hero in the most sincere form of the word.  Moore is typically impressive, but her role is almost painfully short.  It's Caine who steals the show, as he has done in every film he's appeared in over the last four years or so.  His ridiculously aloof, rude, yet oddly charming performance provides some much-needed comic relief amidst a stupefying amount of bleakness. <br /> <br />However, Cuaron is even more of a success in his role as a sci-fi director.  All too often an interesting concept is wasted on a pretentious filmmaker who uses big names and bombastic explosions to attract audiences.  Cuaron doesn't strive for greatness; it comes naturally through the effort he puts into his films and the amount of sheer talent he has.  In CHILDREN OF MEN, he fashions enough of a science-fiction film to make the audience think, enough of a drama to get the audience emotionally-involved, and enough of a thriller to make the audience panic.  It's how surprisingly down-to-earth the film is that makes it all seem so terrifyingly real.  <br /> <br />Undoubtedly, the most horrible aspect of CHILDREN OF MEN is its depiction of the near future.  This vision of 2027 isn't far-fetched at all - in fact, most of the film's scares come from how chillingly similar 2027 is to 2007.  It's a believable future, where newspaper clippings protesting the Iraq War still remain, the designs of cars have changed very slightly, and rock band Radiohead has finally received the credit it deserves.  The suddenty of humankind's infertility, and the speed at which humanity descends into sheer madness, is enough to keep anyone awake long nights dreading the seeming inevitability of so black a future. <br /> <br />What keeps the audience from drowning under CHILDREN OF MEN's tidal wave of futility is hope, a white light that becomes progressively brighter as the film pushes on.  Hope that things are not as bad as they may seem, hope that things will get better, hope that we aren't helpless at the world's end.  But as strong as this hope may be, and even though the film does end on a relatively happy note, it's the fear that things will not get better and that we are helpless that will leave theatergoers trembling and pondering direly far beyond the end credits.
0345457684|1.0|I scanned through this novel and picked it up on a whim. I made it through about a hundred pages before I gave up in disgust. <br /> <br />The writing is on the level of supermarket mystery shlock with some cyberpunk awkwardly tacked on. I found the author's style forced, dumbed down and ineffective. I could feel him wanting to create a picture and an atmosphere, but he just couldn't do it very well. <br /> <br />Morgan uses many predictable, derivitive sci-fi/mystery elements I found myself rolling my eyes more than once. It feels like I'm reading reheated leftovers. <br /> <br />Altered Carbon is just not very entertaining to me. I'm actually quite surprised it has received so many positive reviews. Readers are lauding this as an excellent first novel? I just don't see it. <br /> <br />I actually don't read that much of the sci-fi/Fantasy genre any more because of books like this. A few authors blow my socks off, and I look forward to reading their books because they have real writing talent. I can tell right now that Morgan will not be one of those.
0786838655|5.0|My son picked this book up yesterday and hasn't stopped reading it since.  He has never liked the Harry Potter books, so I don't think that's a prerequisite for enjoying this book.  I also don't think knowing Greek Mythology is necessary---he's been looking up the gods as he reads.  \\"Mom--who is Athena?\\"  It's a great book that does that to a kid's mind.  I am so happy.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah Jones' latest CD, \\"Not Too Late,\\" is an outstanding piece of work that showcases a remarkably talented singer in an industry sorely lacking talent.  Her versatility is more pronounced on this CD than on her previous ones and the song \\"Wake Me Up\\" is worth the price of the CD alone. <br /> <br />Rev. James W. Clifton
B000JK8OYU|1.0|Given one by my daughter, so not paid for.  Bloody weird.  Like a halucination of the Beatles.  Cant be bothered trying to name all the bits. They all are recognisable, but....why? When you think in terms of Las Vegas it just becomes awful. Where are the woolly rough edges? The bits that went wrong but sounded great. Like Twist and Shout. This is a digitally perfect horrowshow. A George Martin dream of what he would have done at the time. But  being done now, it's Lloyd Webberish gibberish. And as for Octopuses Garden.... God help us. The only comparison is Wordsworth chucking out all his youthful visons of nature in favour of his revisionist old age cant (sic). <br /> <br />I think Lennon would have booted it into touch. Well they wouldn't have had to do it would they, if he were still around. Just got Macca in a headlock and written some new stuff... <br /> <br /> - Derek Taylor
B00000JNNY|5.0|Classic music like this should still be played on commercial radio today.  Sang with emotion, soul, and heart.  If you liked \\"At Last\\" in the movie _Rain Man_, you will love every song on this album/CD.  A must have for any Jazz and/or Blues music fan.
1400064287|5.0|This book hooked me from the very start. In order to be noticed in today's marketplace, being different is imperative, but as the authors so clearly point out, that isn't enough. Unforgettable ideas have something more, which Made to Stick very clearly articulates in these six primary principles:<br /><br />- Simple: They're totally focused around the core of the idea. Everything else is virtually irrelevant. But the real challenge is finding that core!<br /><br />- Unexpected: They break patterns, create gaps and capture our attention without any gimmickry. Savvy marketeers will search for the counterintuitive aspects of their core message.<br /><br />- Concrete: Ideas that stick easily understandable. No buzz words, abstract concepts or anything associated with the dreaded \\"Curse of Knowledge\\" are allowed.<br /><br />- Credible: Trusted authorities, believable details, specific examples and analogies help make ideas more readily accepted and increase their stick factor.<br /><br />- Emotional: People \\"care\\" about sticky ideas. In this section you'll learn many strategies on how to create this emotional connection.<br /><br />- Story: With sticky ideas, people often remember how the problem arose, how it was dealt with. The story matters.<br /><br />Speaking of that, these authors tell a great story. Their multiple examples demonstrate these principles over and over again. Mmmmm. I bet they followed their own advice. I loved the Idea Clinics too where they showed before and after examples of stickiness.<br /><br />As someone who works with sales organizations and is a recipient of way too much marketing gobblidygook, I give this book a high five!
0586091718|5.0|I don't even pretend to be intelligent enough to fully understand this book, but nevertheless it has changed the fundamental way that I view the world around me and has given me comfort that I am not alone in some of the strange things I have experienced.  <br />I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the nature of reality, explanation of paranormal phenomena, past lives and the collective unconscious. The author presents the information in a clear, concise manner that even non-physics students can understand. <br />I intend to read the book for a second time in order to fully glean the benefits of this amazing concept.
B000BCE918|5.0|I was very pleased with the price, the presentation and the speed in receiving the triology. Great bang for the buck
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This film is a courtroom drama based on a case of \\"Demonic Possesion\\" vs. a \\"Medical Condition.\\" Instead of trying to \\"Shock\\" the audience with gruesome special effects and gore, it respects its viewers with an intelligent, thinking persons horror film.  It concentrates more on the ramifications from the aftermath of a case involving a girl afflicted with either , Epilepsy or being possed by a demon.<br /><br />The films draws you in and commands your full attention.<br /><br />Its not quite as good as the original \\"Exorcist\\" from 1973, but it is way better than all of its lame sequels.<br /><br />This film is alot better than what I thought it would be.<br /><br />You should definitely check it out.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This concert is so amazing that even I feel like I am in a front row seat at the actual concert. Madonna does not perform, but she entertains most of the time. Performing is when you're basically singing the song and maybe show a few moves, but Madonna brings all of the songs on the setlist to life, and even remixes them, and changes them to a more upbeat level. NOW THAT IS ENTERTAINMENT!!! <br /> <br /> <br />For the so-called Madonna fans, you really need to stop whining. I do believe that this DVD does show this concert justice, and I do think they did good editing, actually brilliant editing. <br /> <br />I read a few reviews on other Madonna live DVD's and some of them said Madonna does not connect with the audience at all. Well this concert Madonna does talk to the audience every now and then, and the finale song \\"Hung Up\\" comes to life when Madonna gets the audience to join in in singing \\"Time Goes By, So Slowly\\" whch is a most memorable verse from the song, and she ends the concert fantastic. <br /> <br /> <br />It is definitely 2 hours of non-stop fun. I really do like the remixes she done of some of her classic songs, such as Like A Virgin, Music, Erotica, La Isla Bonita, and Lucky Star. My favorite performance is \\"Let It Will Be\\", she really shows that she can rock out. She even comes close to being out of breathe at the end of the song, that she even takes a lay down for a few seconds, somebody from the audience gives her a bottle of water, to get something to clear her throat, and then she gets her energy back and then she resumes the concert, and ends it without breaking a sweat in my book. <br /> <br />Definitely a must buy. I give it 5-stars.
B00005JLCI|5.0|They keep changing the dates!!!! If anyone reads this who has any word with those concerned with releasing this movie will you tell them to get on the ball. I am a English Literature Major and it is common knowledge that this is one of the better versions of Hamlet, accurate to the text and encapsulating many of the implied implications of the language of the play. It is even recommended by many professors to students of Shakespeare. It needs to be on DVD or it will be lost, to the chagrin of all Shakespeare fans and students.
B000068QVN|3.0|It may have to do with memory , sequence , songs , details in the recording , etc ... but this has nothing to do with Their Live Album of the same time and space , which is just Fantastic ...

B000001F29|5.0|It's rare you experience a state of anticipation as intensely as with this album. The first track, the standard electronic pop tune I'll Find My Way Home, was a big hit in the early 1980s. Next comes State of Independence, a more complex song, and then comes a dip with Beside. The fourth track is The Mayflower, where Jon Anderson lets his vocals out to play for a while and the duo toss in some imagination.  <br /> <br />Jon and Vangelis then move over into the land of musical magnificence with the title track, a small symphony which plays out over 12 minutes and nine seconds. It's based on the 1941 classic film \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and starts off with the sound of bullets flying as our hero and his posse are under the gun and on the run. The effect is amusing, the music is imaginative, and then about seven minutes in it all changes and we move into a quietly mesmerising love song, one of the most beautifully constructed pieces of music I know. It ends like this: <br /> <br />Silent golden movies, talkies, technicolour, long ago <br />My younger ways stand clearer, clearer than my footprints <br />Stardom greats I've followed closely, <br />Closer than the nearest heartbeat <br />Longer than expected, they were great <br />Oh love oh love just to see them <br />Acting on the silver screen, oh my <br />Clark Gable, Fairbanks, Maureen O'Sullivan <br />Fantasy would fill my life and I <br />Love fantasy so much <br />Did you see in the morning light <br />I really talked, yes I did, to God's early dawning light <br />And I was privileged to be as I am to this day <br />To be with you. To be with you <br /> <br />I still listen to this often and then stop the CD. I don't want to hear any more, which means I don't think I've ever heard the last two songs.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This movie is a classic that I had forgotten about.  Barbra has a beautiful voice and is a wonderful actor.  Kris is so so cute in this movie.  I love to sing along with the movie.  If I had ever married, I would have had Evergreen played at my wedding.
B00005ASGG|3.0|The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a resonating acheivement in film.  That, however, is not a new statement but I unlike others will ground it. <br />     This most complex work, of John Ford's, is a compilation of talents.  The quality, though, that holds it highly above the rest is its successful deconstructive nature.  The Western's various elements are herein taken apart, examined, and then honed to as realistic a nature as possible.  Then, they are put back together as they now are, except. . . except for one thing, now, they don't fit anymore.  Do they?  The righteous sigil of the law can't bring himself to end another's life (our films today ALWAYS justify the hero's killings with self defence, as if it was so simple as that).  The Deus Ex Machina of the film John Wayne feels more like the villain than the hero.  But, despite these sudden disparities with what we've seen on the screen before the film carries a successful and fluid narrative .  So by that, the film acheives the deconstruction genre in its fullest form.  Once the pieces are identified and shaped to perfect points they are amazingly, not just put back together but formed into a cohesive whole.  That final step is the cruelest and breaks the majority of would be genre studies.  It requires displacement of people, places, emotions, and actions.  The man that was one is now two.  The idea that was once impure and illogical is now entirely possible because it is now in the realm of the real human mind.  The film is so exraordinary because it succeeds where so many others fail.  To deconstruct a genre it is not merely enogh to have \\"The Antihero\\", darkness, or violence.  Deconstruction is a difficult progression of story that requires a great understanding of story elements and their conventional use.  It is a testament to this film that it is one of the few successes of its kind. <br /> <br />Now, the ephimeral. <br /> <br />     This review is for a dvd not just the movie.  The film gets fivestars the dvd gets one (zero if I could) and those average to three.  Suffice it to say that the lack of features, the packaging, and the John Wayne Collection moniker at the top of the box are all insults to this film.  There are no notable features of any kind for a film which should be in a four-disk set to rival that of Gone with the Wind.  The packaging is your standard keepcase which, I suppose, is acceptable.  Lastly, I have no problem with John Wayne but putting that garrish moniker on this film would be simillar to printing \\"The Toshiro Mifune Collection\\" at the top of a Seven Samurai dvd.  No, as much as I'd do \\"anything for the man who shot Liberty Valance\\" I will continue to rent the old VHS copy my local video store has yet to ruin and replace with some trite trash like \\"The Dukes of Hazard\\" Unrated.  No thankyou, I'll wait for the film to be released in a five disk set, GwtW + 1.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I was surprised when this version of Jane Austen's masterpiece was released - after the magnificent BBC mini series, I really didn't think that anyone would try and match the unmatchable so soon. <br />However, as this is supposed to be a review of this latest version of Pride And Prejudice I'd better get on with it. Keira Knightley is mesmerizing as Eliza Bennett and I look forward to seeing a lot more of her work in the future. <br />I also loved Matthew McFayden as Mr Darcy,Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennett, and Rosamund Pike captured the very essence of Jane Bennett, the eldest of the Bennett daughters.   <br />Dame Judi Dench gave a good performance as the interfering Lady Catherine De Bourg but Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet left me wondering at both his characterization - dirty unkempt hair and slovenly appearance - and how this portrayal in any way came even close to the witty,intelligent and amusing Mr Bennett of Jane Austens creation.   <br /> <br />At present, Director Joe Wright has teamed up again with Keira Knightley and Belinda Blethyn to make Atonement and I hope his ability to transfer a fine novel to the screen is more successful this time around.  <br />Pride and Predujice is so perfectly written, so precisely mapped out by Miss Austen, that any change is noticeable and the changes in story line are NEVER an improvement on the original.  <br />The wonder of classics like the books of Austen,the Bronte sisters, Thomas Hardy, George Elliot,is that they teach one about the lives of people in another century, the houses,the customs,the language, the fashion of the day and so forth.  <br />So efforts to update or \\"modernise\\" should be kept to a minimum. <br />I enjoyed the latest P&P version, but as a film, not as an adaptation of Jane Austens finest work.
0345373243|5.0|I loved this book. I've read all of the Belgariad and the Mallorean books and never get tired of re-reading any of them.
1402720602|5.0|If you know other guitar building books none of the author's methods will be new to you (with the exception of how he makes the sides) and I'm wondering where the \\"modern approach\\" is. Anyway I like this book a lot because it's an exceptional well made guitar building guide. It's very thorough and covers everything from start to finish with tons of quality pictures that clearly help you understand the process. The author recommends to buy a ready-made fretboard so you will not find information on cutting fret slots in this book.<br /><br />I consider this book a must have for any one interested in guitar building.
B000IY06CK|5.0|I feel obliged to write in briefly with a 5 star review, to boost the average rating so that no-one will see the 3-star average and pass on this marvellous performance and recording. We should be at a little over 4 by now... <br /> <br />I agree with everything that Scott Morrison has said. I thought that Julia Fischer's performance of my favourite violin concerto (well...it's this or Sibelius. Or Shostakovich's First...) was as good as Viktoria Mullova's and (though I hate to say it) better than Anne-Sophie Mutter's live version, while the orchestral accompaniment was even more splendid than Seiji Ozawa's. The extra pieces are also well worth hearing. <br /> <br />Hugely recommended.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Simply amazing! For anyone who wants a true standard for staying power, and one who does it the best, look no further than her MADGEsty herself! This concert has got to be one of the best she's had in her lenghty career. And at 49, she still knows how to rock a party! Eat your heart out Britney!
B000DZIGDU|1.0|My first thought about this movie was that it was flat, uninspiring, depressive and pretty boring.  The best part of the movie was when they were watching \\"Apocolypse Now\\", and I thought too myself, \\"That was a great movie, I gotta watch that one\\".  Then the scene where they are about to watch \\"The Deer Hunter\\" I thought, \\"Wow, another cool movie I want to see.\\"  Then, well, let's just say that scene falls short and turns out for the worse.<br /><br />The characters weren't very interesting.  I didn't feel \\"Swoff\\" was a character to really want to know.  He seemed so disjared, but, I understand the director wanted us to feel that he \\"lost\\" himself.  Well, in the process the audience got lost.  Jamie Foxx's character, was useless.  No presence.  The whole movie was very avantgarde.<br /><br />I wasn't in the military, but from reading reviews from people who were in the military, this movie isn't very realistic.  I don't know either way.  I do know that \\"Full Metal Jacket\\", \\"Apocolypse Now\\", \\"The Deer Hunter\\" were much better film.  And, okay, maybe \\"Platoon\\", which I grew to dislike over the years.<br /><br />Well, that's my review of the movie.  Hope it helps.  If you want to see it, wait until it comes on cable for free, don't buy the DVD.  See it first.

This album contains a lot of heart and a whole lotta soul. Eddie Hazel is amazing.

B000KQGP2G|5.0|Thinking of getting Scarsick? If you are a diehard PoS fan then you will probably buy it anyway. It's definately a new step for them and showcases Daniel Gildenlow at his best vocal-wise. His performance is top-notch on Scarsick. The CD is in a much darker tone throughout (which is where PoS shines in my opinion). Did you like songs like \\"Beyond The Pale\\" or \\"Used\\"? Then you will definately find some of these tracks right up your alley. As a long time fan of Pain Of Salvation, I could not be more pleased with this release. Nothing is ever the same with these guys. There are a few songs that are mediocre however, but the good definately outshines the rest. I'll go into detail about the songs that really stand out here: <br /> <br />Scarsick - The CD kicks off with a dark heavier song. Here the song opens up with a heavy riff and features Gildenlow in his \\"rapping\\" vocals through the verses. Alot like \\"Used\\" off of TPE. Alot of the riffing stays the same throughout, but doesn't make the song any less interesting. <br /> <br />Spitfall - This song takes Gildenlow's singing even more into the rapping verses. Definately another darker song. The chorus takes a break from this and makes the song one of the best of the CD. 10/10 <br /> <br />Cribcaged - A lighter song, and a great one at that. Gildenlow's singing is fantastic here. Another one of those PoS songs that builds through the song, much like \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Iter Impius\\" and just as emotional as those. <br /> <br />Disco Queen - Unlike anything you'll probably ever hear. At first listen you may not like the style here, but it will grow on you. The song has a very 70's disco like sound to it...but with a touch of PoS. Great song. <br /> <br />Idiocracy - Starts off with some drumming and grows into what is a stand-out song. Tough to describe this one, except it features amazing musicianship. <br /> <br />Flame To The Moth - Another heavier, fast paced song. Features some screams during the verses....awesome ones atthat. <br /> <br />Enter Rain - Closes out the CD at 10 minutes. Good song, pretty laid back and light. The only weakness is the outro. PoS fails to wow you with the outros they gave you on \\"BE\\" and \\"TPE\\" Those had some of the best outros I've heard. The song here just fades, but is still a good song. <br /> <br />All in all. If you like PoS you won't be disappointed here. Like alot of their music, spin it a couple times, and let it sink into you.
B000002VCE|5.0|The front cover says it all - yes, this band really did have FOUR guitarists. When it works well, the results are stunning.  <br /> <br />So far as I'm aware, this 1978 offering is one of two live Outlaws CDs, the other being the (now hard-to-find) 'Hittin the Road Live' (1993). Don't worry if you can't get the latter, as this album is by far the better of the two.  <br /> <br />The reason most people would buy this CD is, of course, for the finale, a mind-blowing 21-minute live version of \\"Green Grass and High Tides\\", a track which is surely a strong contender for \\"best-ever guitar-driven rock track\\". Though necessarily slightly less polished than the studio version, the live recording much more than makes up for this by the fresh atmosphere and excitement which it brings to this truly awesome epic. <br />
0553582461|3.0|I'm surprised that this book has so many five star ratings, because I really thought it was the weakest of Hobb's efforts involving Fitz (six books). The writing is still good, and many of the characters interesting, but the book totally disengages itself from the premises laid by the others in the series. Throughout the entire course of the novel track, Fitz is supposedly learning about his responsibilities and his duties to his land and his people, gradually coming to terms with his place within that system. Yet at the end he just suddenly abandons it all, content with going back to a previously (and, in my opinion, correctly) dismissed young love. He basically does exactly what his father did, almost like relapsing into some sort of genetic predisposition for dullness.    There were so many more interesting options for this series to conclude with! I had always felt that Hobb was leading a romance between Kettricken and Fitz, and this to me would have been far more believable than running back to Molly given how well he actually knew either of them. I also agree with other reviews that the pacing of the book is too slow, and that Fitz is almost made peripheral (other characters are in fact responsible for most of the major events in the book). I could, however, tolerate a meandering storyline, and even endure reading about Fitz as a part-time nursemaid, if the ending were not so stupefyingly bland.     Maybe I just don't like the \\"a simple life is the best reward\\" perspective, but I really feel tricked in that we're being told that such simplicity was a false comfort the entire series, only to have it unceremoniously dumped on us at the end. Such a disappointment for such a great series.

B000LPQ6DE|3.0|Why, why, why do we continue to rewrite the classics to suit our modern mindsets and sensibilities?  I feel Ruth Wilson played a wonderfully subtle Jane, and I liked the way Toby's Rochester is so obviously interested in Jane from the beginning, even flirting with her it seems. However, the message of the movie, itself, missed the mark in full!  It completely ignored the theme of self-righteous, hypocritical religion (Aunt Reed, pastor, others) contrasted with the sweet, true Christian forgiveness and trust in God (Helen).  This is crucial because it lays a foundation in Jane's life.  Once hatefilled and bitter toward all who've wronged her, Jane emerges from the school having found peace through a relationship with God that continues to influence every decision she makes.  This Christian influence is most noticeably absent from the scene just after the first Mrs. Rochester is revealed.  While the modern movie watcher might applaud the \\"self denial\\" and \\"decision to do the right thing\\" by Ruth Wilson's Jane (who, after a life of such hardship deserves a little happines after all, who could blame her, poor thing, right?), Jane, herself, as portrayed by Bronte, would have been appalled at the thought of repeatedly kissing and fondling a married man as an appropriate way of taking leave of him \\"forever\\".  Although I'm always glad for a chance to revisit this worthy story, at best this Masterpeice Theater version was superficial/shallow,or, worse, it was willfully defiant of Miss Bronte's worldview.
B000002H4C|5.0|This soundtrack brings back so many good memories. I graduated in 1981 and had never seen any thing like this movie. Has anyone noticed though, on the samples, that the first song isn't Sammy Hagar's \\"Heavy Metal\\", but Don Felder's version of \\"Heavy Metal\\"?

078322687X|5.0|Breakfast Club is one of the most beloved movies. All the action takes place pretty much in one room. The 'action' consists of kids talking to each other. I've seen the Breakfast Club many times over the years - if the movie were playing right now - I could mouth along and do the lines of each character.     I notice completely different things about this movie over time. Maybe we look at the world around us based upon the previous information we've been given. We've been informed that being a victim doesn't make one timid, but the opposite, tough, or pious. In a world where everyone 'reaches to grab the lowest rung of the ladder' (the lowest rung of the victim ladder) I think the focus of this movie is on John (stereotyped as the criminal). John's a bad-boy. His family is poor. He's abused at home by his dad. At one point in the movie Claire (the princess) says of John, \\"Just ignore him\\". John replies, \\"You couldn't ignore me if you tried\\"    When I think about this movie today I notice more how Brian (the nerd) is the true 'victim' here (of course the movie is trying to make a point that they are all victims). Brian doesn't get the girl. John and Andy (the jock) often treat Brian as completely irrelevant. Even the school principle, caught up in events, refers to Brian as 'peewee' a couple of times.     It only took me 20 years to notice, and, I'm a nerd myself. A society obsessed with victimhood should at least get right who the victims are.    The song that went with the movie was, 'Don't You Forget About Me' by Simple Minds. I think, in the end, I always remember Brian - the other kids asking him to do their assignments; in a sense, asking Brian to speak up for them - Claire saying, 'We trust you'. Guess they need the nerd guy after all.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|Lyrics are not bad, but what happen to the beautiful melodies we are use to??  Seems like the artist and her band are on vacation for too long. If you are a new listener, stick to album 1 or 2 and skip this one all together.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|This is a fun movie that I have watched a couple of times, mainly because of the delightful performance by Diane Keaton. Jack Nicholson is also very entertaining in his role. I have to give credit to the makers of the film for doing something that is quite rare in movies--showing a love story about two older people. On that level, the film does have a positive message--that life, and particularly romance, is not over after 50. A 50-something woman can be desirable, even to a young, gorgeous doctor, played brilliantly by Keanu Reeves. The problem I have with the movie, though, is that it reinforces a lot of stereotypes about older women. In the end it is extremely conventional. I guess you can't expect unconventional from a Hollywood romantic comedy, but the film could have pushed the envelope a little more. It would have been totally awesome if they had just changed the last 5-10 minutes. Please don't read on if you don't want to know what happens in the end..... <br /> <br />The portrayal of the Erica/Julian relationship, especially at the end, just reinforces the taboo against older women dating younger men (whereas it is still okay for older men to date younger women. After all, Jack Nicholson is 9 years older than Diane Keaton--they are NOT the same age). Even though Julian is attracted to Erica, she is never really comfortable with their relationship because of the age difference, and of course she chooses the older man in the end. So the message of the movie is \\"stick with someone your own age, especially if you're a woman.\\"  <br /> <br />Putting age aside, Erica makes a strange decision to choose a man who has been a jerk to her over one who has treated her with total kindness. What woman in her right mind would dump a gorgeous doctor who is madly in love with her (and with whom she has great chemistry) for an insensitive playboy who has broken her heart? I think it's great that in the end Harry has learned a lesson about life and women, but it's too late forhim and Erica. He missed the boat. The movie should have ended with Erica and Julian happily together running into Harry with a new paramour, a woman at least close to his own age, a few years after Paris. The idea that the nice guy never wins and that one weekend of good sex followed by months of heartbreak trumps a relationship with a giving, devoted person like Julian is really annoying. In place of the \\"granny and grandpa\\" ending, I like to watch the movie up until midway through the Paris dinner scene and then turn it off and imagine that the sexy older woman lived happily ever after with her hot, young, doting boyfriend. <br />

0790731452|5.0|Yes, I bought the TOPPS \\"MARS ATTACKS\\" trading cards when they first came out...and I still have them! So when this movie came out I ran to the theater to see it, expecting to be disappointed. Not so. I found Tim Burton's film to be both funny & scary, true to the spirit of the original cards & a great send off of 1950's sci-fi flicks. I consider MARS ATTACKS a classic of the genre. This is a great treat for sci-fi fans!...and I'm partial to Tim Burton's \\"ED WOOD\\" as well. Enjoy.
B00000K3D4|4.0|I remember watching this movie as a child and wanted to give that same experience to my children so I decided to purchase it for them and make a movie night out of it.  From the very beginning they were attached.  My children were able to stay focused during the entire movie and they loved it at the end.  Even my husband who is not too fond of these types of movies said that he also liked it.  Godd pick for a family movie night at home.

Been a fan of afi for many a years now and  I bought it when it came out all excited to hear their new music, and it's absolutley awful.sounds like generic pop. it seems like they wanted to please all the little mtv kids by relasing this. bought it a while ago, listened to it once, hated it. thought i'd give it one more shot a while later, and couldnt finish the album. it's collecting dust in my cd rack.
B00003CWPL|1.0|When Barbara Streisand recently made the statement that \\"it's the artist's role to disturb,\\" she was evoking the oh-so-tired mantra uttered for so many years by people who use disturbance as an excuse for not being artistic.  Eraserhead is somewhat disturbing, somewhat humorous, and always bizarre, and for some people, this is enough to make it an exceptional film.  But for all the praise that has been mysteriously thrown upon this mediocre enterprise, Eraserhead still comes across as a film student's first feeble attempt to make a masterpiece by being as puzzling and distasteful as possible.  There is nothing here but a vague vacuousness -- a clear indication of the nihilistic philosphy behind a young David Lynch's sad project.  If you wish to watch a masterpiece, watch something like Kurosawa's \\"Ikuru\\" or Tarkovsky's \\"Andre Rublev\\" or, quite frankly, even Robert Wise's \\"The Sound of Music,\\" and skip this heavy-handed, amateurish attempt to create meaning out of idiocy.

0060512806|4.0|Neal Stephenson's book is a dense, well researched story that is one-half the history of modern cryptography and one-half an adventure novel.  The WWII parts of the book are often hilarious and have a 'Catch-22' tone to them.  The portion of the story set in the present varies in quality from blah to excellent.  A firm editor that limited Stephenson to perhaps 700 pages would have made for a better pace without sacrificing all of his exquisitely detailed digressions.  I found the novel as a whole very entertaining and erudite, and would reccommend it to anyone, with the caveat that some undergraduate history classes and a little math make the book a much more fulfilling read.
0684803356|5.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls is quite simply one of the best novels ever written.  Honestly, I had relatively low expectations before reading it.  I read A Farewell to Arms and found the terse, repetitive prose and stilted dialogue underwhelming.  For Whom the Bell Tolls is superior to A Farewell to Arms in every way.  This is a complex novel with some of the most memorable characters in modern literature.<br /><br />This mesmerizing novel neither glorifies war, not does it vilify it.  Hemmingway's detached prose is world weary, exposing both sides of the conflict, allowing us to see that war, inevitable and futile, is never simple.  Characters on both sides of the conflict struggle with their own fears and regrets.  Both sides commit, and are subjected to, the atrocities and horrors of war.  As different as each side may think they are from the other, in the end, they are all human and are not as different as they think.<br /><br />For Whom the Bell Tolls is riveting and powerful, easily one of the ten best novels of the 20th century.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|This is an overall entertaining indie film, until the end.  Then it subverts it own message.  I'll explain in the SPOILER below.<br /><br />When the family arrives at the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, they see that it's an exploitative affair, treating 6 and 7 year old girls like adult women.  The little girls wear makeup, adult style bikinis and evening gowns, and perform lewd song & dance routines.<br /><br />The family considers pulling their daughter, Olive, from the pageant.  They  consider the pageant wrong, and we are meant to concur.  But they leave the decision to Olive, who wants to go on.<br /><br />Turns out that Olive's song & dance is the most lewd of all, a strip-tease of sorts.  The pageant audience is shocked by Olive's lewdness, but the parents rush to defend their daughter.<br /><br />I don't care which \\"message\\" the filmmakers want to send.  Either (1) child beauty pageants are exploitative and psychologically destructive, or (2) it doesn't matter what a child does, as long as it's her choice.  But pick one message, and be consistent.<br /><br />The message seems to be: child beauty contests are exploitative and destructive, unless Olive enters one, because Olive is real cute, and we've grown to like her, and her dysfunctional family is loving, and besides which, she's not as skinny as the other girls, so whatever she does is fine.  The other little girls are lewd and shallow, but even if Olive behaves more lewdly than the other girls, she's not lewd at all (in her case it doesn't count).<br /><br />This could have been a strong indictment of child beauty pageants.  It was a fine film until the end.  I'd have given it four stars, but I'm deducting one because of its confused ending.<br /><br />BTW, I see this DVD has four alternate endings.  That's five endings total.  So it does seem as if the filmmakers themselves were confused about what they wanted to say.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I'm not really understanding some of the references to this album being overtly \\"folk\\" or \\"country\\"...I find this album far less country than \\"Feels Like Home\\", instead settling comfortably in between hints of jazz, soul, and yes, a little bit of country. The result is an evenly flowing current of thoroughly enjoyable, low key, sumptuous expression. I think this is Jones' best work to date.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|As has been said many times before, it is not the destination, but what happens on the journey that defines who a person truly is. This fact has never been more substantiated than by Little Miss Sunshine, a very funny movie that also is thought-provoking and moving. <br /> <br />Though this movie seems a little light on the plot, it is the excellent ensemble of the six family members that make it what it is. Basically, when little Olive (Abigail Breslin) finds out that she has won a beauty pageant and thus can compete in the prestigious Little Miss Sunshine pageant, her family and her pile into their VW Bus in order to drive to California. Consisting of her failing motivational speaker father Richard (Greg Kinnear, habitually silent brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), drug addict grandfather (Alan Arkin), mother Sheryl (Toni Collete), and depressed suicidal uncle Frank (Steve Carell), the family and the antics they share are classic. From the Bus that won't start without everyone pushing and then jumping on, to the frustration of Richard's business attempts, the subplots and backgrounds of each character are very engaging and keep you hooked. <br /> <br />So, I highly recommend Little Miss Sunshine. Its incredible ensemble of characters and thoughtful \\"dramedy\\" style make it a must for anyone who likes movies.
0743298020|5.0|It isn't very often that I read a book and want everyone I know to read it so I can talk to them about it.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and think it's one that most people would enjoy...and when I say I \\"enjoyed\\" it, that kind of freaks me out because it is rather creepy for the first half, but so well written that you're sucked into the tale and don't want to put it down.  I'm assuming this is why I'm so tired today! <br /> <br />The premis of this book is that the most popular British writer, Vida Winter, is dying and wants to tell her life story to a woman, Margaret Lea, who runs an antiquarian bookstore with her father.  Ms. Lea doesn't embark on the task very willingly, but does so anyway because she loves reading and having discovered Ms. Winter's work, she is excited to find a complementary soul. <br /> <br />I don't want to tell much more about the plot other than that because to do so would be to spoil the book.  It is about family, facing your demons, class system (it IS a British novel after all), and most importantly the love of reading and a good story.  It is a book that came to me through many different channels until I finally admitted that I couldn't avoid reading it.  I'm glad I didn't because it may just be my favorite recent novel. <br />
8174460578|3.0|I don't argue that this book contains a lot of wisdom, it most certainly does and it's a good introduction for Westerners to some important Eastern ideas.  That is not to say these same principles aren't at work in Western thought, but it's more a question of emphasis.<br /><br />This is a very inspiring, optimistic and simple read.  It is not packed with any dense material, however, it contain pearls of wisdom that have practical application for leading a better life.<br /><br />Other people have covered the specific topics, so I won't revisit that territory.  I also don't want to knock the content, but I would lean toward a used copy given the price of the book.  On the other hand, the principles inside are priceless, but you can also find them in many other places besides Deepak Chopra's books.

0385474547|5.0|The main thrust of Things Fall Apart is that with the arrival of the two pronged partnership of Christianity and the Colonial administration indigenous African polity entered a new phase of cultural conflict.   <br /> <br />In Part 1 and Part 2 of Things Fall Apart Chinua Achebe masterly sketched the village Umofia and its people and Okonkwo, the main actor, prior to the arrival of the Christian missionary as a time of cultural groupings of indigenous peoples ensconced by their traditions and taboos.   The author's portrayal of life's economies of separation of duties, family relations and strong men sharing the invigorating cola nut and the eternal responsibility of the head of the family to be the provider for his house and hearth is a classical masterpiece.   In all pre-modern civilizations a marriage is a bonding between clans and family groups - Achebe handled these subjects with style and insight and finesse.   The funeral scene and clamor and mystique around a person of title are vividly described.   Self-exile in case of breaking a tribal taboo is an age-old cultural \\"right thing to do\\" whether it is a Moses the Jew or the Greek philosopher or Okonkwo.    <br /> <br /> Chinua Achebe is through his storytelling describing the overlapping and socio-spatial configurations of a highly developed cultural tradition and economy of life.  Bophelo is a difficult word to translate directly into English but it means something like \\"abundant and healthy and fulfilling life.\\"  Bophelo is conceived as residing in a series of social organisms that constitute society with encompassing social relationships - the person as embedded in the family hierarchy  and simultaneously in a socially constructed geographic space.  Okonkwo's homestead is located in a specific village as part of a wider kinsmen-group.   The village is sustained by an overriding communal spirituality and beliefs.   Okonkwo's personal identity, his being and his wellbeing is inextricably bound up with a particular social and geographic space.  Chinua Achebe is masterly defining context of Okonkwo's identity and social location.  The machismo Okonkwo's life is dominated by anger and apprehension, especially when his oldest son is intrinsically attracted to poetry and storytelling and he wished his daughter to be a boy.  <br /> <br />In Part 3 of Things Fall Apart we see \\"a clash of civilizations\\".  In the story of Okonkwo his whole world starts crumbling when his eldest son Nwoye is extricated from his father's Bophelo.  It is not the faith of the Christians but the poetry of the new religion that has captivated Nwoye.    Not only his eldest son but also other of his village are proselytes of the new faith and the new order.  And this is where things fell apart. <br /> <br />Things Fall Apart is a master piece in the age-old tradition of story telling in the African lore. <br /> <br /> <br />
0345479092|4.0|This was a good book comparable to Babywise in that it balances between the extremes of Schedule & Demand Feeding. It brings outsome good points that Babywise doesnt touch on, and makes routine feeding seem so much easier with its positive tone and several acronyms.

As an extra help, If you ring Growing Families Australia they can give you the ph No of a PDF contact mum for extra support). <br /> <br />This book is a good alternative to Babywise for those mums who just cant bear to let their babies cry to sleep.

0743244257|4.0|*Cosmopolis* takes place during one hectic and surreal day in the life of Eric Packer, multi-billionaire commodities juggler extraordinaire. He's a kind of an intellectual version of Bret Easton Ellis's now archetypal Patrick Bateman character--young, handsome, incredibly buff, stupendously wealthy, and sociopathically remorseless. A wheeler and dealer in digital fortunes, he sits at computer screens behind stylish dark glasses and manipulates markets in ways that create the illusion of success, which is just as good as the real thing, inasmuch as success is mostly a matter of illusion anyway. And just like Ellis's Patrick Bateman, Packer works his incomprehensible and barely legal magic while uttering gnomic and heartlessly humorous asides, put-downs, pseudo-cultural analysis, and philosophic aphorisms that straddle the borderline between wisdom and retardation. He's contemptuous, egomaniacal, jaded, bored, and homicidal. But in DeLillo's version of this by now relatively popular archetype of the post-Reagan 90s, Eric Packer is also a man who is rediscovering his soul--or, rather, he's coming to grips with the utter absence of it.<br /><br />*Cosmopolis* is set mainly in Packer's luxury super-limousine which creeps across a traffic-jammed Manhattan on the way to a haircut appointment. Along the way, Packer keeps appointments with various underlings who leap into and out of his limo, encounters anarchist riots, presidential motorcades, and celebrity funerals, engages in various sexual interludes with lovers, has impromptu meals with his wife who he happens to run into at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and is informed by his security chief that he is the target of a deranged assassin.<br /><br />Somehow it works. DeLillo has pulled off a difficult feat of absurdist tragicomedy in *Cosmopolis* and he's done it with all the pyrotechnic wordcraft that one has come to expect from one of our greatest contemporary novelists. As philosophical as it is farcical, *Cosmopolis* manages to disturb both our expectations and our world-view as it takes on issues as diverse and weighty as capitalism, celebrity, violence, wealth ((and the lack thereof)),  memory, love, and immortality--and does it all with verve, style, and drama.<br /><br />Another great novel by Don DeLillo that seems to grow in significance even after the final page is read.Cosmopolis* manages to disturb both our expectations and our world-view as it takes on issues as diverse and weighty as capitalism, celebrity, violence, wealth ((and the lack thereof)),  memory, love, and immortality--and does it all with verve, style, and drama.  <br /> <br />Another great novel by Don DeLillo that seems to grow in significance even after the final page is read. <br />
1579125549|4.0|Yes, Polgar's book is huge, and it does look great on my coffee table.  However, its size presents its greatest weakness, and the fact that Polgar had no good computer program in 1993 to double check his solutions is its second weakness.   <br /> <br />Regarding the size, you will never finish 5000+ problems, and will not learn as much as you would with a more focused approach.  I suggest using the more focused software product CT-ART 3.0, which has 1200 problems that you can group by difficulty or by tactical theme, and costs about $25.00.   <br /> <br />Regarding the errors, well, let's just say I stopped after doing about 400 of the problems, and have marked about ten as having errors.  For example, #994 (mate in two) has two viable solutions; the given Qxd4, but Qc3 will also work.  #1071 (mate in two) gives Nxf6 as the solution, which indeed will lead to mate next move, but Nc7# is mate in one.  <br /> <br />Buy it for the looks, but practice tactics with software.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|This film, which is based on Anthony Swofford's account of his experiences in Desert Shield and Desert Storm, is a bit controversial but controvery that makes us think is a good thing. <br /> <br />In some ways this film is the exact opposite of the film Black Hawk Down. In Black Hawk Down, the war action never ends, whereas in Jarhead it never seems to start. Thus Jarhead focuses on the preparation for war, the boredom waiting for war, and the irony of fighting a war at the fringe if the action. <br /> <br />The film seemed to wish to make a statement about young male soldiers - what makes them tick. In this regard, the film succeeds. The film depicts these young 19 and 20 year old fellows as nieve about the world and yet foolishly cocky. These fellows were under educated and under achievers from rural areas or the inner city. They were not the sons of doctors and lawyers from the suburbs. They were influenced by a substance called testosterone that fuels aggressive blood lust and wild mood swings. They also are subject to the effects of alcohol, which we all know does not mix well with testosterone. Yet, they are also pack driven and eventually fall in line under the direction of an alpha male, played very well by Jamie Foxx in this film.  <br /> <br />The film also casts a jaundiced eye toward military leadership. These young men were not really prepared for war, despite their bravado. The malfunction of equipment, such as gas masks and communication equipment, was a constant running joke in the film. Those who know just how much tax payers must pay for such useless broken equipment to military contractors realize this is far from a joke. <br /> <br />The story or plot involves a group of soldiers waiting to fight, always on the edges of the action, and thus they experience such adventures and finding thousands of burned Iraqi vehicles and charred bodies; or nomads complaining of shot camels; or a desert of black burning oil fields.  <br /> <br />I think that this is one of those films, like Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, that get better with age and distance. With time the film will be seen as a film about the young male Marine, and not a political statement about our conflicts in Iraq.  The title \\"Jarhead\\" should lead us to the real purpose of this film.  <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|A great ensemble cast delivers a dynamite screenplay with a deft comic touch and sense of timing. This is easily one of the best \\"road movie\\" comedies I've ever seen. In fact, there wasn't a weak moment in it that I was able to detect. Although I own it on DVD, I'm glad I saw it in a theatre because the shared laughter at the ending was not to be missed. Olive's \\"performance\\" at the pageant just about did me in. I loved the strength of the surprise element on the ending in that you just couldn't see the train coming before it hit you.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed Alan Arkin over the years but this performance here has to rank among his best. In my humble opinion, whatever accolades this movie receives are well deserved.

B0007OY2P8|1.0|*warning* spoilers <br />What an awful adaptation. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's?????? The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy's General Tilney. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I love Jane Austen movies usually. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the \\"bad guys\\" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good, isn't. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen.
B000KGGLCU|4.0|This is a superb concert - simple as that. The DVD loses a point for having 4x3 menus though!! it is SOOOOOOO annoying and very VERY strange! My TV is set up to auto-zoom 4x3 material to fill the (16x9) screen - this works great for me except on this disc the buttons on the main menu disappear off the bottom of the screen! I have to change the aspect ratio every time i go to the menu. Never in my life have I heard of a widescreen DVD having 4x3 menus! But, aside from this annoyance, this is a truly excellent DVD/CD combo. Fantastic value for money too. Buy it - you won't regret it!
B00006IUL7|4.0|Sleep disorders are not new to murder mysteries, but the way Christopher Nolan represents insomnia visually is at least as wonderful as Al Pacino's patient acting.  Pacino plays a detective from L.A., Will Dormer, who is sent to Alaska to help out an old friend with a murder case.  Dormer and his partner (played by Martin Donovan) are under investigation by Internal Affairs in L.A., so there's more to this temporary transfer than assisting a fellow badge.    In Alaska, it's light all day and every day when Dormer and his partner arrive, and Dormer has insomnia.  Pacino gradually slows his character's actions and reactions down until I felt that he was severely debilitated and in danger.  He makes mistakes: some deliberate, others on accident, and still others he isn't sure of.  The latter make for the most intriguing part of this well-constructed thriller.    Hillary Swank plays the smart, plucky detective, Ellie Burr, who is stuck serving misdemeanors instead of actual collars.  She has studied Dormer's career and admires him.  Swank plays the role without overreaching.  I cannot say the same for Pacino.  Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Jack Nicholson all suffer from the same affliction: As great as they are as actors, their personalities are greater.  I cannot watch them in films and pretend that they are anyone but themselves.  I still enjoy their performances, but they are decidedly bigger than any of the characters they have ever played.  They just can't help it.    Maura Tierney gives an excellent but thankless performance as the front desk clerk (or manager) of the hotel where Dormer and his partner stay.  She softens Pacino in a way that Swank is unable to do.  Or maybe Pacino tempers himself; it's hard to tell.    Robin Williams, as Walter Finch, is quite excellent at being creepy.  The banter between Finch and Dormer is something of a throwback to a different time: \\"You're my job,\\" says Dormer when Finch maneuvers for sympathy.  They seem to know each otheras if from across the room, not like lovers, but like familiar character types in a familiar story.    And Nolan isn't trying to do anything entirely new in Insomnia.  He's telling you a story you already know.  He twists it slightly with great visual effects and a cold, blue camera lens.  As much as I enjoy the film, it's not perfect.  The screenplay is written into a corner, and the ending is easy to see a mile away.  Likewise, some of the dialogue between Dormer and Finch is heavy-handed and cheesy.    At its heart, this is the story of a downfall.  Don't judge the film by its murder/mystery/suspense genre tag.  Character takes precedence over plot.  It's not as good as Nolan's Memento, but Nolan's craft leaves its marks.
1594200823|5.0|Mike Pollan brings his reporting skills to paint a detailed picture of the good the bad and the ugly concerning the sources of American Diet. A definite \\"can't put it down\\" volume as interesting as the Botany of Desire. However, we see much more of the authors own personna in this book.  His personal thoughts slowly emerge on Balance between Ideal and Practical, the importance of keeping the vision as much as possible but not becoming radical (or at least not violently radical) is a metaphor for a whole philosophy of life.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|I am a huge fan of Norah's voice and talents. I enjoy her COME AWAY WITH ME disc so much that I've nearly worn out my CD listening to it.  <br /> <br />I purchased her second disc, FEELS LIKE HOME, the day it was released, and didn't particularly like the direction it took. I only ended up listening to it once, having come to expect more of a jazzy sound that you wouldn't feel uncomfortable listening to in even the most upscale urban setting. I felt that perhaps FEELS LIKE HOME was just a one-off, and looked forward to her next release. <br /> <br />The newest release, NOT TOO LATE, is even more bizarre than the last one. It is far too country-folk, with some very strange instruments, whistling, and even some outlandishly strange quirks. I would, regretably, feel almost embarrassed to play this disc in front of others.  <br /> <br />If you enjoyed Norah's jazzy sound, be wary, as it is almost entirely absent from the new disc. My best advice to my greatly-beloved and highly-talented singer-songwriter is to move back toward her jazzier roots. Remember pieces like, COME AWAY WITH ME and DON'T KNOW WHY, and move back closer to that direction.
B0000E1ALR|3.0|Before purchasing this, you might want to compare the record company's \\"essentials\\" with a true fan's list and see if songs you forgot about (and want to own) are missing. And I'm not talking about the list from the guy who complained for three paragraphs about which obscure songs weren't included. The title is \\"the ESSENTIAL Bruce Springsteen,\\" not \\"Some Guy's Personal Favorites.\\"  <br /> <br />So, I've included a list of what would be considered ESSENTIAL songs. These are not necessarily my favorites, but HIT singles, significant cuts, and the obvious best songs from each album. <br /> <br />NOT FOR: If you have most of these songs in your music collection, you don't need this CD or the Essentials, for sure.  <br /> <br />RECOMMENDED FOR: ...those who don't care that they're missing the many great songs I've listed here that aren't on the actual CDs (compare my list with theirs-- if they left out a lot of songs you like, buy \\"Born to Run\\" and wait for the inevitable \\"Very, Very Best of Bruce Springsteen!\\") <br /> <br /> <br />Disc: 1   <br />1. Blinded By the Light   <br />2. Spirit In the Night   <br />3. 4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)   <br />4. Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)  <br />5. Thunder Road   <br />6. Born To Run   <br />7.

Disc 2 is almost a disaster. Ex.: \\"Born in the USA\\" features a whopping SEVEN top ten singles, only three of which are on these CDs. I think most people buying this collection would consider at LEAST 4 or 5 of them among the songs they'd buy this for, so where the hell are they? I've reinstated them on my list. <br /> <br />1.

A little light hearted, but mostly the villian, Michael Caine, a talent agent of little worth, makes Little Voice a local star for a little while, till she breaks away from her loudmouth mummy and has a little romance.

0393327655|1.0|I was disappointed by this book. On the surface, what Sam Harris writes seems all very 'reasonable'. It's when you start paying attention to what Harris focuses on - and on what he deliberately doesn't focus on - that you notice this is another cleverly veiled attempt to mold the public mind towards war against Islam. Sam Harris was raised by a Jewish mother (according to Judaism, that makes him a Jew). Against this very Jewish background of his (a fact which you won't find in his book), criticizing Islam and Christianity, while at the same time hiding one's Jewishness and sparing the tremendous amount of racism and violence inherent in Judaism, leaves one with the aftertaste that there's a hidden agenda in Harris' bashing of religions with the big stick of 'reason', but failing to apply reason to the religion that needs it most.
0780622553|5.0|Only an ignorant non-scientist(all humans are born scientists, so what happens to them by the time they reach puberty? Dark City!) cannot see how this is one of the most important films of our times.  The least thing to say is that this isn't your standard hollywood sci-fi action movie.  Another thing I've noticed is that a commentary on at least one dvd edition talks about it being similar to a silent sci-fi movie I think \\"metropolis.\\"  Well, I don't claim to fully know that analogy, but from what I remember them complaining about, it had nothing to do with what I'm seeing as so great about this movie!  In fact, what's perhaps most remarkable of all is I'm starting to get the impression even the actors and directors/producers of this movie don't realize what they did with this movie! <br /> <br />Still today, people think of science as just info gathering and pointing at say the moon and saying . . . ope, there it is!  What a discovery!  They may say much the same thing about mathematics; but, then they never have a real answer to the nature of science/mathematics.  Even scientists/mathematicians well into the 1900's and even many in the early 21st century don't understand the fundamental nature and origins of scientific/mathematical concepts. Plato was the first to write down the beginnings of an understanding with his caveman story, but 1) life was/is to hard and fast-paced for most to ever bother to read(and then think about it) that plato story, and 2) it isn't the end of the story as far as the secret behind the nature and origins of mathematical concepts. There was lots of confusions between theory and experimentation.  Perhaps to make this a little clearer, let's talk about the discovery of the solar system. <br /> <br />The discovery of the solar system is the classic example how scientists/mathematicians have to look behind the curtain to see the underlyin truth.  Just taking the immediate observations of the heavens(facts?) leads to a falsity; that the universe and the sun go around the earth; it takes noticing contradictions like the phases of the moon, the back and forth motions of the planets and the presence of mind to sit down and take those things to heart and try look behind the curtain so to speak to see that the earth is a planet going around the sun and not the other way around! <br /> <br />This same process that happened in the discovery of the solar system is what had to happen to discover how mathematics works.  Well, actually, just mentioning the science behind the solar system is enough to serve my perposes, but mentioning that that same process is at the heart of all science and even the discovery of the true nature of mathematics/science(I highly recommend Jacob Bronowski's \\"The Origins of Knowledge and Imagination\\"; an amazing book for a 175 pages!), and shall I say for noticing the social problems of humanity today!   <br /> <br />People are asking 'what's going on?'. But, they don't realize that they are like the people in dark city; socially conditioned; it takes stepping out of that social quagmire to see it all! <br /> <br />This review is getting to long as it is, but this is what Dark City represents poetically. Humanity is born without answers like the Dark City folk and slowly and maybe/hopefully enough hero's can wake up to see what's on the other side of the walls of ignorance we are all born in!
B00005NWLO|5.0|Having seen Skynyrd blow the Who right off the stage in 1973 this album audibly shows what they could do. You can feel it. Southern Shmuthern! It's Rock and Roll at it's best. If you didn't know where they were from you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. People get hung up on this southern rock thing. BFD!! These guys worked to get where they got and are anything but mediocre. I've read the same thing about the Beatles.. that they were mediocre at best! Yeah right!!  <br />This album throws you back in the seat from the moment you drop the needle in the groove. I've worn out vinyl copies, thrown many 8 track copies out the window of my car, more vinyl and cassette and have the original release of this on CD (that sucks) and now this. If you are going to buy only one Skynyrd album, make it this one. They never put on a bad show!! Not even the lineup that is playing today!! They can still smoke any band right off the stage!!
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Don't get thrown by the first two reviews that Amazon has posted on this page.  This DVD is the authorized release and the quality is fantastic.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|What qualifies someone to critique someone's craft? There are as many types and sounds to music as there are entertainers. Whether it is good, bad, or just so-so depends on one's individual taste. I personally wouldn't write a review of something I couldn't give at least 3 stars to. Why bash someone's art just because you don't personally care for it?<br /><br />TO ME, this cd is melodic, rich in spirit, and so soothing to listen to. Norah Jones has an amazing voice and is a very talented song writer. I wonder where all of the \\"critics'\\" songs and cds are and how they are selling? lol
0736063684|4.0|When I get asked about what certain lifting exercises to do, this book is a great reference tool. When you are preparing a lifting program, this book is really helpful in determining the types of muscle groups that you are wanting to do. <br />If you want to work on your triceps, all you need to do is look in the back of the book at the chart of the human body. The triceps are identified by a certain color. Then, you flip through the book and look for the corresponding colors that identify triceps exercises.  <br /> <br />If you are just starting out, I would highly recommend this book in developing your workout routines. If you are experienced, a little more information has never hurt anyone.
B000ICM5IK|4.0|...where are \\"War\\" and \\"Training Montage\\" from Rocky IV? Even \\"Take You Back\\" could've been thrown in there somewhere. I guess on any \\"Best Of\\" collection, there will be some glaring omissions.     Aside from that, it's a great collection (though I could've done without \\"Can't Stop the Fire\\"). The remix of \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" is listenable, something that can't be said about a lot of remixes. A definite must for any fan of the Rocky franchise.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Composer Dario Marianelli said the spirit of Beethoven's early piano sonatas weas in his head when he composed the opening sequence, a piano score played beautifully by Jean-Yves Thibeuadet. This is appropriate as Beethoven was an exact peer to Jane Austen, whose book birthed the film treatment and gave reason for Marianelli's Oscar-nominated score.<br /><br />While the film depicts the comedy of manners in 18th century England, the score represents the concept that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most romantic novel ever written. There is one probelm with that -- the period of the book precedes the romantic century -- the 19th century -- by some years and actually represents the \\"classical\\" period of the 18th century.<br /><br />No matter, of course, as the score is wonderful in every sequence and often dreamily romantic. As other reviewers also suggest, it captures the essence of each film sequence it accompanies. For me, it is the best film score since \\"The Pianist\\" in that regard.<br /><br />I think the score could have been reproduced better for home enjoyment, however. The recording technique, perhaps meant for theater reproduction, sometimes results in a bit of fuzzy and boomy music where either Thibeaudet or the English Chamber Orchestra appear to be playing through gossamer. It never does much to inhibit enjoyment any sequence of the music, which I wish lasted longer than about 1 minute 10 seconds on average. But that's movie music, you know.
B000002KAT|5.0|I'd call these truly special, almost holy songs, but the music of \\"Astral Weeks\\" so completely transcends common notions of \\"song.\\" Pure soul and heart have shaped sound and time into otherworldly expressions of longing. No, not songs, these are magical  transmissions intercepted from a distant realm. These sound more so like random diary passages, interrupted testimonials, overheard confessions all set to profoundly sumptuous rhythms. Each one is entirely unique, sublimely peculiar, oddly familiar. One tune flows into the next, the tempo changes are delicate and nuanced, but somehow jarring. To pick this or that favorite moment is absurd and juvenile. The only consideration can be the impact of its entirety, which is nearly soul shattering.<br /><br />I've never read it, but Proust's \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\" must posses this same tragically moving quality, and, if it doesn't, it should damn wish it does. Anyway, \\"Astral Weeks\\" is some of the most disturbingly elegant, passionate music I've ever experienced. It's impossible, obsessive, self referential, and just so wonderfully, awfully beautiful. A monumentally original creation. Yes, Astral Weeks is that great.
B000I0RR7Q|5.0|This classic film is more than just a love story- it's at once an allegory, morality tale, and propaganda film.  Most of all- it's propaganda for living.  It sends the message that the greatest battle we have to fight is with ourselves, and that inevitably- love conquers all.  If you watched this film as all you saw were grainy models, stoic acting, and car scenes obviously filmed in studio- you were looking too hard.  You should look at the film and see yourself staring back.  There is something for everyone in this film, which makes it good- but if you know anything about the world at the time this movie was made, it's a truly great work.  Watch as Renault, the corrupt Frenchman, battles against the Germans with snide comments and other asides- but just as he battles against the Huns- the Vichy and Free parts of his mind are struggling for his better inclinations.  Take another look through the lenses of the era, and you will understand why it swept the academy awards, won unanimous support of the censors, and the love of a war torn public.
B000002KAT|5.0|After 218 reviews and a solid 4+ average rating not much more can be said about this disc, it is just that good. It is really quite incredible that nearly forty years have passed since this seminal Van Morrison work was released; he's still around offering his Celtic soul to whoever will listen. Hopefully you will listen. Start here to understand the Celtic poet-soul-man. It doesn't get much better than this. Begin by listening to \\"Madame George,\\" from here you will know if this is for you. What appears at first listen to be ramblings of esoteric themes will eventually unveil itself as the offerings of the beauty in a world gone mad. Van Morrison delivers his spiritual sermon in everyday terms that require attention to detail; the details are in your life. No matter the mood your in if you put this disc on your soul will feel cleansed; it's like Irish Spring for the soul. I'm a musical junkie who has countless stacks of music in various formats, from different eras, from different artists but if I had to pick ten discs to take with me to never have access to the others , this one would make the trip with me. I have some 8,800 tunes and counting(must be selective) on my I-Pod and probably only five Van Morrison discs but this is the beginning and the end; he will probably never achieve what he did with this disc. \\"Hymms to the Silence\\" is another disc in this vein and a close second.  This disc, \\"Astral Weeks\\" is a tapestry without seams, an endless stream of conciousness, exhibiting secrets from within the depths of your inner soul and emotions. Van Morrison has a key that unlocks your innerself, leaving you with a smile on your face in satisfaction for the fact that you are a living and breathing being who grasps life and all it's trials and tribulations. Rejoice in this masterwork, it only comes around every forty years or so by special artists.

0743298020|5.0|It's unusual for me to read a book and not be able to pick up another to read because the characters from the first book have filled my head!  This is an incredible debut.   For those of us who adore reading, it is a tale for us - a true reader's book.  I was pulled into the stories (for there are many here) immediately and could not put it down.  Now I want to go back and start it again.  Beautiful written, suspenseful, magical and heart-breaking, The Thirteenth Tale is a MUST read.
0375703764|3.0|It seemed like all at once, people on all sides were reading this book and telling me how amazing it was.  Naturally, I rushed to grab a copy to see what all the fuss is about.  I was sorely disappointed after reading House of Leaves.   <br /> <br />The novel is many things, but a literary masterpiece it is not.  It seems to hover in between being either a multi-layered literary labyrinth and a solid horror story, without ever committing to either.  Danielewski's footnote forays into mock-academia and the unenlightening snippets of Johnny Truant's sordid life (he's either whining about drug hangovers and bad sex, or complaining about how freaking 'freaked out' he is, no in between) detract from what could have been an interesting, and much shorter, debut novel. <br /> <br />I take particular issue with the fact that on the book's rear cover, a reviewer suggested that Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace should 'bow down' before Danielewski... both of those authors achieved something unique in their works, without any of it seeming contrived.  Read Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest or Broom of the System, or Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow if you're looking for a true literary labyrinth.
0393317552|4.0|This bestseller aims to explain why some areas of the world have progressed technologically and others have not.  The book is well written and very interesting, blending history, geography and sociology.  Professor Diamond's thesis is that the differences in technological advancement are largely due to favorable or unfavorable geographic factors.  These factors allowed some crops to grow, but not others, and allowed for trading of ideas and technology or resulted in isolation.  A main object of the book is to refute the racist view of history, namely that some groups of people are inferior and thus unable to develop technology.  This is only the briefest summary of an almost 500 page book, so the reader is directed there for a more detailed presentation of these ideas.<br /><br />While I agree with most of Professor Diamond's thesis, I believe that he has not given sufficient weight to some social aspects of the problem.  As Professor David Landes points out in \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\\", the evolution of good government and the rule of law play pivotal roles in determining how societies evolve and how successful they are.  There is also some benefit (at least insofar as the evolution of technology is concerned) in living in a battleground as opposed to an isolated and peaceful society.  Conflict speeds the evolution of technology, although at a steep price.  The isolated society may not develop the technology of gun making, but is that so bad?

B00051E906|4.0|This is a simple lightweight instrument. Made in Russia. Easy to use. Does not tick or beep with each count, only when a theshold is crossed in terms of counts.  <br />I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because the manual seems to have been written by someone with a Russian/English dictionary who had one semester of English. But it was understandable. It also did not have any information on how to interpet the readings.  <br />Not a professional instrument but good for someone who wants to be prepared for a local nuclear accident or terroist attack. Peace of mind. I tested it by holding it near a smoke detector and it worked!
0920668372|2.0|The title caught my eye as I was searching for books to read to my grandchildren. I did not find the story appropriate for grandparents to read to their grandchildren as it is a story from a mother to a son. The end alludes to the mother dying too, which I didn't want to read to small children. I gave it to my 34 year old son to let him know how much I loved him. It was something of a substitute for a greeting card.

Quite Excellent! <br /> <br />\\"Dance me to the end of love\\" - Seductive vocals reminiscent of Billie Holiday.

Cool jazz guitar turn-around. <br /> <br />\\"Careless Love\\" - Really cool blues with featured organ. <br /> <br />-L.
B000002UVX|4.0|ALMOST PERFECT, EXCEPT FOR SOME POWER TRIO CLICHES AND MEDIOCRE SOUND QUALITY    This album was the only official live album authorized by Jimi Hendrix.  The songs are taken from two shows, New Years Eve, 1969 and New Years Day 1970 at the Fillmore East in New York.    There have been several releases of this album.  The original LP release contained the six songs listed here and was 45 minutes long.  The first CD release was a quick and nasty job, and also contained the 6 six songs.    In the early nineties, there was a new CD release that contained three bonus and was 20 minutes longer.  The bonus tracks were Hear My Train, Foxy Lady and Stop.  There were no liner notes.  This is the version I own.  I have seen other versions with different bonus tracks.    The latest version is a \\"remastered\\" version but only contains the original 6 tracks.  An improved sound would certainly be welcomed over older versions.  I haven't heard the remastered version, but what how much the sound could be improved.  It seems like most of the problem is in the original source tapes, how it was recorded and mixed.    There is also a double CD called Band of Gypsies Live at the Fillmore East that has some of these songs plus many others from these two nights.    This is a refreshing change from the Jimi Hendrix Experience, especially if you have been collecting the hundreds of different CD releases that are out there.  While the Jimi Hendrix Experience is one of the most important bands in rock history, there was just too much material released from their short lifespan and some of it was getting stale.  Just how many versions of Foxy Lady and Purple Haze do you need to hear, especially when none of the versions are significantly different from the others.    Band of Gypsies includes Buddy Miles (who had a successful solo career) on drums and Bobby Cox on bass.  They add a new dimension to Hendrix's music.    What I particularly like is that Hendrix doesn't do all the singing.  It is interesting to hear someone else (Miles in this case) take the lead at times and Hendrix sing background.      This group is more of a straight ahead rock power trio.  There are a few times the band lapses into power trio cliches with bass and guitar riffs.  And the vocal stylings are reminiscent of a number of power trios of the time.  But, at the same time, it is interesting to hear Hendrix's take on those Cliches.    So what is different about this album is that instead of being an innovative leader and creating revolutionary sounds, he is playing to sounds of the times and is just an evolutionary part of the history of the power trio.    My favorite Hendrix album is called Blues.  It selection of songs that capture Hendrix at his innovative best.
B0000508U6|5.0|Not often does a band come through and shatter the mold for popular music.  Before this cd, Americans were fixated on 'boy bands' and Outkast.  This release expanded the palette of nearly all who listened; the door was open for such bands as Keane, Franz Ferdinand, and even Modest Mouse to gain their fair share of radio play.  A deeper and more spiritual side of music was exposed that had an overwhelmingly great effect on the industry as a whole.  This CD is simply amazing, with every song complementing each other seamlessly.<br /><br />While most casual listeners will be quick to enjoy the pop-friendly \\"Yellow,\\" it is such songs as \\"Everything's Not Lost\\" and \\"Shiver\\" that best define this album.
B000002MFE|5.0|This album reinforces, and reminds us, why \\"Claptin is God\\" got spraypainted all over the western world in the 1970s. Play the unplugged version of \\"Layla\\" back-to-back with the \\"plugged\\" version and you'll see how a guitar maestro can create two different songs out of the same cloth. <br /> <br />Unlike other artists who appeared on \\"Unplugged\\" but then refused to unplug (Springsteen comes to mind), Clapton is unafraid to demonstrate his chops in what could have been a difficult playing atmosphere.  <br /> <br />\\"Unplugged\\" also allows Clapton to show his full range of stylistic abilities, from rock to blues and back again. <br /> <br />Well worth buying.

074356619X|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie, \\"The Secret\\", I have no doubt that you will enjoy this audio book.  Rhonda Byrne and the rest of the Secret staff have put together a resource that does a wonderful job of expanding on the topics, thoughts and interviews that were highlighted in the movie.<br /><br />For those people who know and understand the Secret or the Law of Attraction will be able to plug into this audio book and will, without question, take away some of the most useful knowledge from teachers like: James Arthur Ray, Bob Proctor, Joe Vitale and many others.<br /><br />For those who don't yet know \\"the Secret\\" I would probably recommend to have them watch the video first and then expand upon that enlightenment by listening to this audio book.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this audio book is exactly what you would expect.  You will get out of it what you put into it.  As I said earlier, \\"If you liked the movie, you will like this book.\\"

0307237699|5.0|I bought this book before Christmas, and to be truthful, I had a hard time getting through it. Not because it was poorly written or boring - it is just hard to sit through page after page of common sense written by someone who seems to be a genuinely nice guy.<br /><br />Mr. Obama does a good job of laying out what he thinks it will take to reclaim the American dream for the forgotten working classes. His solutions and thoughts are measured, intelligent, and moderate. In the process, he talks some about his own childhood experiences, about running for the Senate, about how he detests begging for campaign dollars, and how he really enjoyed the part of his Senate campaign where he toured around Illinois, listening to the tribulations and thoughts of various citizens. He is beyond bright and he is also a dedicated family man. He talks about coming to Washington, thinking at first how it might be fun to live the life of a campus coed again - he and his wife decided she should stay behind in Illinois with their children, and he would stay in a D.C. apartment three days a week. Then he discovers that this phase of his life is over, and he just can't wait to be back home at the end of each week. He talks about the thought process he went through making some of the more major votes he cast while in the Senate - CAFTA and the Supreme Court for example. He also gives his impressions of George W. Bush. Although he is kinder than he should have been, I think his impression of the man is probably spot on. Most importantly, Mr. Obama is a man who \\"gets it\\" when it comes to the working people. He understands the crush of student loans keeping young people out of teaching because they have bills to pay - Mr. Obama is paying back his own student loans in fact. He understands that retraining is not the sole solution for displaced factory workers, especially when they are retrained for low paying jobs. Finally, he understands that the health care system of the U.S is gradually collapsing under its own weight, and that the social compact between us all has been pretty much shredded over the last six years.<br /><br />If what Mr. Obama wrote in this book is genuinely \\"who he is\\", I have no trouble with voting for him for President. I have only three caveats - two being his relative lack of national governing experience, and his total lack of foreign policy experience. On the third point, Mr. Obama himself talked about how hard it was to raise enough money to compete in a national election unless you were a man of means, and Mr. Obama readily admits he is not. Thus candidates have to sell themselves out to the moneyed interests of their party in order to have a shot at election. The question is this - knowing that Mr. Obama will have to do this, will it really matter that he possesses a great deal of wisdom and common sense? In fact, won't he be forced to govern a certain way to insure holding on to the Presidency should he win it, since he will need those moneyed interests again in his reelection campaign? In fact, if legislators of both parties could throw off the shackles of big money, wouldn't we suddenly see an increase in the number of intelligent moderates in Congress on both sides of the aisle? I think so. Do you truly believe that the Senate vote on the hideous Bankruptcy Bill would have been 74-25 in favor of passage if MBNA hadn't been lining the campaign pockets of every senator in that room, and those senators needed those campaign funds? I think not.<br /><br />In summary, I really enjoyed the book. It is uplifting to see that there are decent bright people out there with an interest in government. I just wonder if given the chance, could Mr. Obama really make a difference.apsing under its own weight, and that the social compact between us all has been pretty much shredded over the last six years.  <br /> <br />If what Mr. Obama wrote in this book is genuinely \\"who he is\\", I have no trouble with voting for him for President.

B000286S8S|5.0|This greatest hits is better and more complete although the new hagar songs are not as good as the new david one's on the other best of.  Also I like the alternate ending on finsh what ya started better too.  Awesome best of collection from an awesome band.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|To start with, this is not a carbon copy of Fallen.  Not by a long shot.  The departure of Ben Moody left a huge mark on this band, and they are better for it.  Amy Lee is now much more free and able to be more creative.  The songs on this album are richer, more vibrant, more emotional, and simply better than the ones on Fallen (and all of Evanescence's pre-Fallen material as well).  Everything this band does seems to be better than their previous efforts. <br /> <br />Tracks <br />Sweet Sacrifice - Amy Lee has declared that this will be the third single from the album.  This is a scathing, guitar-driven song that opens the door with a bang.  Terry Balsamo, Ben Moody's replacement, immediately makes his presence (and superiority to Moody) known. <br /> <br />Call Me When You're Sober - the lead single from the album.  This was a great choice as the first single from this CD because it is something of a bridge between the band's sound on Fallen and their sound on The Open Door. <br /> <br />Weight of the World - another crunching anthem in which Amy Lee's angelic voice carries the lyrics over the guitars as if they are floating. <br /> <br />Lithium - the second single from the album.  It has a very atmospheric and cool video with lyrics that are the pinncale of what it means to be Evanescence - laced with sadness and misery, yet at the same time hopeful and carrying a positive message.  Nobody can pull this off the way Amy Lee does. <br /> <br />Cloud Nine - rather than having the vocals and guitars seem to be trying to outduel each other as the focal point of the song, this track allows one to take the lead for a while then shifts to the other. <br /> <br />Snow White Queen - Amy Lee loves the story of Snow White.  Here she tells the story of a stalker from the point of view of both the stalker and the stalked, using the \\"Snow White Queen\\" as the image for the individual being hunted.  Moving and beautiful. <br /> <br />Lacrymosa - a truly experimental song that pays off big time.  Equal parts Mozart and metal.  The band's desire to take risks results in this operatic anthem that borders on over the top cheesiness yet manages to walk the fine line between that and elegance. <br /> <br />Like You - similar to Hello from Fallen, this is Amy Lee's tribute to her departed sister. <br /> <br />Lose Control - here we hear a much different side of Amy Lee.  This song is about an affair, and uses Mary's lamb (\\"his eyes black as coals\\") as a metaphor for the cheating man.  Lee sings from the point of view of someone that has been restrained and desires to break free. <br /> <br />The Only One - smoothly slides between quieter parts and frenetic guitars without missing a beat. <br /> <br />Your Star - the simple piano at the beginning of this song makes the energy and intensity reached by its end that much more shocking, impressive, and engaging. <br /> <br />All That I'm Living For - rocks out in a manner similar to that of Sweet Sacrifice.  The last taste of metal on the album. <br /> <br />Good Enough - The Open Door is about freedom, opportunity, and, ultimately, the hope for happiness.  Amy Lee allows herself to be happy in this peaceful song filled with beautiful imagery that is carried by the power of her vocals.
B000J103YI|5.0|I love this CD as well as the movie. Many of the songs resound in my mind and I catch myself singing and popping my fingers to the up tempo sounds of Move, Fake Your Way to the Top, and so on......    Kudos to Jennifer Hudson on an outstanding performance. If anyone was going to attempt to stand against Jennifer Holliday with And I Am Telling You, I guess it would have to be another Jennifer H.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I've been using this workout since it first came out (1993)on video, and am updating to DVD.  It is that good. This workout is not for pansies. I am very active - swimming, skiing, biking, hiking, yoga - but this workout always kicks me in the [...] and makes me sore if I haven't done it in awhile.  I use it on rainy or below freezing days, or when I just don't have time for other activity. The cardiovascular part of the workout is short (20 minutes or so), but brutal.  If you really focus and put all your power into it, the cardio benefits will turn up a notch.  Cindy's instruction is down-to-earth and direct, and she doesn't patronize by saying \\"one more!\\" or \\"great job!\\" None of that cheesy workout music, either - this soundtrack rocks.  I've bought other workout videos that mostly just make me feel like I've been on a walk in the park, or that confuse me with difficult moves.  This is the only one that I would recommend to anyone sincerely wanting to get in shape with no messing around.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Thank you for delivering this perfect flawless copy of the cd in a timely fashion.  Couldn't be happier!!!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I always liked My Chemical Romance, but I was never what you would call a fan of MCR. \\"The Black Parade\\" changed all that. This album has a depth in not only the chords, but in the message that somehow got lost in the last two albums. MCR was always known for their dark melodic music with screaming guitar riffs and screaming vocals filled with pain. That was fine and it fit in so well with the Emo genre that this group was associated with, however, MCR has managed to jump out of that genre and turn themselves into a fully cohesive unit. One that should be taken seriously by all other artists.  <br />\\"The Black Parade\\" is haunting and comforting all at the same time. Gerard Way and his bandmates have more than stepped up to the challenge of creating a masterpiece record that will surely keep loyal MCR fans happy and attract an entirely new kind of listner; the mainstream audience.  <br />MCR has created more than an album they have created an epic adventure that is sure to please the ears for years to come.

B000GIXIBY|5.0|Im not exactly sure what the guy below me is smoking when he say this film is grainy. I own the VHS, and multiple dvd copies of this film. There is a scene in the HD version. (In the beginning just as he gets captured.) you can actually see dirt on the lens of the camera. I know its dirt cause its not in the next scene. Every one knows this move was shot very low budget like the rest of the evil dead series. So of course its not going to look as good as Black Hawk Down or Back Draft.<br /><br />But thats what makes this move so awesome.
B00015YVD6|5.0|I waited awhile for this dvd to arrive, but was aware that it would take awhile.  I was seriously expecting a used, battered copy, but this was brand new, not even opened, and I couldn't be happier.  Well worth the wait!!!
B000FGGE68|5.0|I don't know what people were expecting when viewing this movie. Its obvious that no matter how it was done it wasn't created for the academy awards. It is eye-candy. It is intended to be a fun creation. What I loved about this movie the most is that it brings us back to something I sorely miss, the techno vision of the 90's that was cut off way to quick. Colours, music and fast paced cinematography. These are the tools to create the vision of Ultraviolets world. Its the other end of the (vampire) hero's world spectrum, light and vibrant rather than dark and brooding.(not that their is anything wrong with that, I love that too). Enjoy it for what it is, it wasn't created and produced this way by accident.
006054094X|1.0|This book is a shameless mishmash of speculation and misdirection that only obscures the extraordinary voyages of the Chinese 15th century mariners. There are some good books out there about the Zheng He voyages - read them instead of this tripe.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What can you say? Serenity should herald a return of the series and franchise movies for decades. It is simply perfect. Too bad the studios can't see that. <br />
B000056HE9|5.0|Wonderful cast.  Enjoyed seeing the movie that I thought relayed the essence of Christmas past.  Loved seeing Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven again.
074356619X|5.0|WOW!  I reveiw both of these products repeatedly.  The CD is in my vehicle and I listen to it while driving around on my daily travels. By applying the practices suggested by \\"The Secret\\" I am noticing positive changes taking place in my life.
B00005JNS0|5.0|A WONDERFUL animated film, Cars, brings to the screen the story of a race-car with its eye on the Piston Cup trophy \\"getting stuck\\" in as small town just a few days before the big event.  As it turns out though, all is not as bad as it seems...  Owen Wilson (!!!), Paul Newman, Tom Hanks, Michael Keaton, John Goodman, Tim Allen, Jay Leno, Billy Crystal, Cheech Marin and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.    The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all EXCELLENT!  In short, Cars is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Madagascar, Hoodwinked, Antz and Monsters Inc.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I bought this for my brother, one of the ultimate Led Zeppelin fans and he loved it!  I loved it too.  We saw them in St. Paul at the now defunct Civic Center on April 13, 1977.  It was one of the greatest rock shows I ever saw!  This DVD brings much of that back.  It's great, what more can I say? <br />Mike, the old rocker <br />Eagan, MN
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Despite what some of the other reviewers have said, I really like this version of Jane Eyre.  Ruth Wilson is fantastic as Jane and captures her quiet yet resolute spirit very well.  Toby Stephens is a little too good looking for this version of Rochester, but I liked that they chose someone who was not middle aged.  People married so much younger during their time, that I think it's highly likely Rochester could be in his mid-to-late thirties instead of being portrayed as a much older man just because he is twice older than Jane's 18 years of age.  I also liked that the screenwriters decided to include some of the more mischievous and playful spirit of Rochester's character from the book this time instead of portraying him as simply a dark brooding, Byronic hero of Victorian literature. <br /> <br />There were some liberties taken with the text where scenes were played differently than they are in the book, and the language was modernized at times.  However, the screenwriters still captured the spirit of Charlotte Bronte's book well, here.  One of my favorite things about this adaptation is that they actually included the scene with the gypsy - which most adaptations completely leave out.  I also believe that there was finally a fair portrayal of Bertha Mason and the background story of Rochester's history in Jamaica and his struggle to keep the family fortunes intact...  <br /> <br />All in all, it may not be a perfect adaptation, but the acting is wonderful.  Ruth Wilson is, in my book, hands-down the best Jane.  I just wish they had dwelled a little more on her upbringing at Lowood School so that those who aren't familiar with the book could understand more about the evolution of Jane's determined character.  Still, I highly recommend this version to anyone who is a Jane Eyre fan or even for someone who doesn't know the story.  Also, if you read the book first, you will get so much more out of it!  Way to go, Masterpiece Theater!
B00005YUNY|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  Yes is my favorite band of all time.  I saw this concert in August 2001, and again in 2002, with all my old geezer buddies.  The concerts were great, 2001 being the better of the two.  This DVD shows much of that.  Seeing \\"Gates...\\", Close to the Edge, Ritual, and others like this was such a thing of beauty and wonder.  We'd seen them in the round in 1979 and in the '80's.  This concert and DVD is just as good as their 1979 show!  They can still play it! <br />Mike, the old rocker <br />Eagan, MN
0307237699|3.0|I liked this book in the very beginning. Obama addresses things that anyone living in America today feels. I think he's right on point when he states little things like liberals are probably more spiritual than people expect, etc. However, there are parts of the book that are a little boring and I disagree with many of his stances on race. Being black and white, he has an interesting racial identity, but it seems like most of his ideas about racial issues come from statistics or studies. From my personal experiences, I've seen the opposite of many things he claims to be true. His solution to racial problems is very vague most of the time. He wants to start programs, but what does that mean exactly? I don't think programs is the asnwer to anything. I think this is a good book to read, but I felt at times he was trying to play both sides. He doesn't come accross as insincere, but after reading the book I don't think I'd vote for him in an election unless the republican going against him was a George Bush again. If he did win an election, I think he would make a good pres or vice pres anyhow and would support a guy like this even if I didn't vote for him.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|The first 3/4's of the film I thought was good, gothic horror.  Unfortunately, the ending was too \\"blockblusterish and really did not fit the atmosphere of the early part of the film and was a big let down.  The ending kept this movie from being a classic.
B00005MKA1|5.0|Kaya is a pleasure from start to finish.  As usual, the remastering further enhances the listening experience.<br /><br />And again this album is full of Marley songs the average listener has probably not heard.  Well worth the money.<br /><br />5 Stars all the way.
B00005JPBF|5.0|I have never doubted the acting ability of Penelope Cruz. In fact, I have been a fan for quite some time.  This, however, must be her best performance to date. She takes you on an emotional ride that is pleasant and exhausting all at the same time and the kick is you don't want the ride to end. It won't matter if you are a male or female...you will fall in love with this portrait and with Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br />Es que la mujer es una maravilla, la cual no hemos vistos en mucho tiempo! Ole! Y Brava! <br /> <br />The entire cast brings a believable life to their characters and you feel them through every scene and miss them when they are not present.  Carmen Maura is sheer bliss to watch on the screen.  <br /> <br />Almodovar is his usual genius self.  Every frame of the film is a painting.  He cannot help himself because he is a true artist.  I love this story and all of its odd turns.  There is something wonderfully sexy about the juxtoposition of food, sexuality and violence that when put together brings a sensation of pleasure you don't often get to experience in American cinema. As a Spaniard by birth, I am proud of this film...as an American I am grateful that these films are making it more into the mainstream. <br /> <br />Here is to an Oscar for Penelope!
B00005KB9X|5.0|Natty Dread is a real treat.  Songs that I have heard many times in their original Jamaican version get outstanding treatment here.  I understand this to be Marley's first effort without the Wailers.<br /><br />He re-records Lively Up Yourself and Bend Down Low and breathes new life into them.  The new songs are very good too.  The band is outstanding throughout.<br /><br />And don't let this version of 'No Woman, No Cry' throw you off.  It's a different tempo than the famous live version but does work in the context of this cd.

B000F9RB9Y|4.0|Although Schwarzenegger became known with the two Conan pictures, it was this movie that established him as a major star.<br /><br />This was a low-budget flick and the original picture quality was not that great, but it looks better than ever than on Blu-Ray, with rich detail in the night scenes, good color balance in the few daytime scenes, and a killer soundtrack.<br /><br />This is worth upgrading from the standard DVD, as both picture and sound are a substantial improvement.  The extra clarity and sharpness of Blu-Ray make this classic even more enjoyable.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|What a great buy.  This is Bruce at his best.  The clarity of his voice and the magic of his lyrics come together to take you on a journey that leaves you wanting more.  The additional bonus DVD of one of his old concerts is spellbinding.  If you want to know what's so great about Bruce Springsteen, buy this and get ready for one of the most magical rides in rock 'n roll history.  What a storyteller and musically talented artist.<br /><br />They just don't make 'em like that anymore.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen! It has fast become my favorite movie and the special features are aboslutely amazing!
B000M5AJQS|2.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Coming in to \\"The Departed\\", I was lucky to already know what the plot was about (some trailers are so obscure as to not mention anything about the plot, to hide the fact that it sucks) and it got four stars (highest rating) in my local newspaper's movie reviews, with lots of great mention on acting and drama and directing.<br /><br />The movie was very well-done. It was a bit confusing in the start as some of the actors mumbled and made it hard to understand them, but this didn't deter from the plot as though you missed something important. The directing style wasn't too special at first, but showed some definite high points and strengths later on (the scene where Martin Sheen's character, chief Queenan, is thrown from the roof of a building in slow motion, a bunch of people in the theater I was in gasped audibly, and even more so when he hit the ground)<br /><br />The acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, not just in the movie, but in their roles as rats, were very convincing (some scenes with DiCaprio, and Frank Costello suspecting him as the rat, made me genuinely think he wasn't a rat, but rather pretending to be one.)<br /><br />The dialog is crisp and never seems to falter with uselessness or insanity or something off the wall completely. My only complaints were that Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan had some unexplained obsession with the golden dome roof of a church, in which he'd constantly stare at in his apartment. This was never explained or even delved into in the least. Another was the mild hint at Costello slowly going crazy over the course of the movie. I didn't see this at all. He did some eccentric things in the later course, but nothing to truly qualify as ascending derangement.<br /><br />The movie peaked when the two rats discovered each other out (after Costello's death) and DiCaprio's character William Costigan went out trying to expose him, even going so far as to lure him into a trap and trying to arrest him, despite not being a cop (his identity was erased for secrecy reasons during his mission, which only the police chief who was killed knew, and the Sergeant played by Mark Wahlberg, Seargent Dignam, who left the police force rather than hand over the identity of their rat in Costello's group).<br /><br />It all seemed to go downhill from here as Billy Costigan is killed by an officer who was revealed to be a second rat working for Costello, who then let Sullivan go. He then killed one of the officers who was friends with DiCaprio's character, and then was killed by Sullivan. Then he went home, to discover Dignam there, who then killed him and wandered off.<br /><br />The final scene is that of Sullivan's balcony, with a view of the golden dome church, and a rat on the banister sniffing something. For some reason, this ending left me unfulfilled, and a bit disappointing, almost anti-climactic for a movie which was building up so much intensity, complexity, and drama.o lure him into a trap and trying to arrest him, despite not being a cop (his identity was erased for secrecy reasons during his mission, which only the police chief who was killed knew, and the Sergeant played by Mark Wahlberg, Seargent Dignam, who left the police force rather than hand over the identity of their rat in Costello's group). <br /> <br />It all seemed to go downhill from here as Billy Costigan is killed by an officer who was revealed to be a second rat working for Costello, who then let Sullivan go.

B000IFS0HM|5.0|I had heard so many good things about this book that I was actually reluctant to read it. I thought that it could not measure up to the reviews- but it did. McCourt's prose reads like poetry. I encourage the reader to first listen to the CD of McCourt reading Angela's Ashes with his Irish tongue. Also, the movie is NOT a disappointment, and is a \\"must see\\" for those who loved the book. <br /> <br />McCourt gives away the struggles he and his family went through for decades, but through it all the book remains full of love, wonder, trimuph of spirit and will, exuberance and faith. A five star book, sometimes too painful to get through, but written with a spirit like no other I have ever read.
B00006RYIQ|5.0|Just recently getting into Gene Clark's impressive body of solo work, I started with White Light and (after only one listen) was initially unimpressed.  To tell the truth, I can't think of a Gene Clark album that actually wowed me on the first listen.  After a few spins though, [[ASIN:B000068PQ7 White Light]] found its way permanently under my skin as a fantastic exercise in poetry, delivery, and the possibilities of folk-rock production (it's got some pretty gnarly yet subtle electric guitar).  Gene's songs are instantly understandable and accessible, but only to a point--eventually there's a final barrier of mystery in the words and in the sentiment, and that's what keeps me coming back to his music.  It's wonderful to puzzle over just what he means and feels, and it's a hallmark of great songwriting when a song doesn't mean just one obvious thing and it's up to the listener to interpret.  So, White Light is a fantastic (if commercially unsuccessful) record--enter No Other.<br /><br />With No Other, Gene fleshed out his songs with lavish ensemble production (check out the bonus tracks for more stripped-down versions), including several female background singers, multiple guitars and keyboards, and some surprisingly different (for Clark) effects.  With all due respect to some of the other reviewers, \\"country-rock\\" is a pathetically inadequate attempt to describe the sound of this record.  No Other has its country-rock moments, but the entire album is so far-ranging that any attempt to classify it wastes words and detracts from enjoyment--I'd rather let the genre-bending sounds just wash over me.<br /><br />Gene's voice is in prime form--the torture and emotion in his vocals is totally enthralling, and his strained, tentative delivery is still something I've only heard done well by Clark himself.  The album opens with \\"Life's Greatest Fool,\\" a country-rocker in which the easy-going music belies the large-scale wondering that Clark's doing.  The production is admittedly quite different from Gene's earlier, more stripped-down records, but I think it works.  The other instruments never detract from the force of his songs, they just make them (deservedly) more grand.  \\"Silver Raven,\\" sets a darker tone, one which will permeate most of the album, with a somewhat bleak poetic vision.  \\"No Other\\" is one of my very favorite tracks, bearing little resemblance to \\"country-rock,\\" or any other type of rock, for that matter--the fuzzed-out bass charges the song with an urgency supported by Clark's words--\\"all alone we must be part of one another.\\"  Chills.<br /><br />Impenetrable poetics fill the album, as on the colorful \\"From a Silver Phial.\\"  \\"Some Misunderstanding,\\" is yet another highlight--the album's epic centerpiece and one of Clark's most compelling soul-searching works of art.  In the cascading wall of sound that the song conjures, Clark cries \\"we all need a fix at a time like this, but doesn't it feel good to stay alive?\\"  Wow again.  More of the same, high-caliber songwriting and performing closes out the album.<br /><br />No Other resonates very strongly with me on a personal level (such a subjective criterion, I'm sure everyone doesn't feel the same way), but whether you find Clark's poetic explorations relevant or not, these are well-written songs with great lyrics, one of the most original voices in rock history, and some great music to go along with it all.

0307346609|4.0|All we love zombies. I mean, crushing zombies. And we gotta be prepared for the wars to came between zombies and humans! So, go ahead and read this book. You'll find it funny and scary. Considering it all, is not a bad novel, but don't expect high literature, but a lot of fun stuff.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|Just recently getting into Gene Clark's impressive body of solo work, I started with [[ASIN:B000068PQ7 White Light]] and (after only one listen) was initially unimpressed.  To tell the truth, I can't think of a Gene Clark album that actually wowed me on the first listen.  After a few spins though, White Light found its way permanently under my skin as a fantastic exercise in poetry, delivery, and the possibilities of folk-rock production (it's got some pretty gnarly yet subtle electric guitar).  Gene's songs are instantly understandable and accessible, but only to a point--eventually there's a final barrier of mystery in the words and in the sentiment, and that's what keeps me coming back to his music.  It's wonderful to puzzle over just what he means and feels, and it's a hallmark of great songwriting when a song doesn't mean just one obvious thing and it's up to the listener to interpret.  So, White Light is a fantastic (if commercially unsuccessful) record--enter No Other.<br /><br />With No Other, Gene fleshed out his songs with lavish ensemble production (check out the bonus tracks for more stripped-down versions), including several female background singers, multiple guitars and keyboards, and some surprisingly different (for Clark) effects.  With all due respect to some of the other reviewers, \\"country-rock\\" is a pathetically inadequate attempt to describe the sound of this record.  No Other has its country-rock moments, but the entire album is so far-ranging that any attempt to classify it wastes words and detracts from enjoyment--I'd rather let the genre-bending sounds just wash over me.<br /><br />Gene's voice is in prime form--the torture and emotion in his vocals is totally enthralling, and his strained, tentative delivery is still something I've only heard done well by Clark himself.  The album opens with \\"Life's Greatest Fool,\\" a country-rocker in which the easy-going music belies the large-scale wondering that Clark's doing.  The production is admittedly quite different from Gene's earlier, more stripped-down records, but I think it works.  The other instruments never detract from the force of his songs, they just make them (deservedly) more grand.  \\"Silver Raven,\\" sets a darker tone, one which will permeate most of the album, with a somewhat bleak poetic vision.  \\"No Other\\" is one of my very favorite tracks, bearing little resemblance to \\"country-rock,\\" or any other type of rock, for that matter--the fuzzed-out bass charges the song with an urgency supported by Clark's words--\\"all alone we must be part of one another.\\"  Chills.<br /><br />Impenetrable poetics fill the album, as on the colorful \\"From a Silver Phial.\\"  \\"Some Misunderstanding,\\" is yet another highlight--the album's epic centerpiece and one of Clark's most compelling soul-searching works of art.

B000LC3ID8|5.0|Best of the three.  Yes, there is more gore.  Yes, there are even more new and inventive ways that people get tortured and killed.  But for me, that was not what created the suspense in the film, it was the story of Jigsaw, Amanda and Lynn.  Amanda is an especially interesting character.  I had not seen the other two movies in a while so the \\"flashbacks\\" were helpful., especially to help flesh out her roles in all of this madness.<br /><br />I think this movie is the most intelligent of the three.  I liked the sort of \\"twist upon twist\\" added to the end.  Although I hope this is the last installment of the Saw franchise, I am sure money-hungry Hollywood is already planning another.  Here we have Jigsaw, who has appointed himself \\"God\\", on his deathbed playing more of his gory games.  When he says he despises murderers, it's a big fat clue for the story, but has his brain cancer made him so deranged he actually believes that lie?  By trying to take him from a crazy, twisted, psycho killer into a killer with a cause, or a \\"message\\" it weakens the story even more than it did in Saw 2.  The story almost tries to make him a little too warm and fuzzy, and I am just not buying that!  The movie, especially the ending, is no less breath-taking for it though.<br /><br />Top-notch acting from the entire cast.  Original story.  Inventive horror scenes make this a great gory horror movie.  There are no scares or jump scenes here though, just full frontal goriness.  If you're squeamish, you should probably pass.  My husband had a hard time stomaching it and actually questioned my sanity for watching this type of gore.  Pshaw on that I say!
1400062756|4.0|A very powerful concept, well supported with research.  Easy reading, highly recommend for anyone. <br /> <br />Because the book was written to appeal to general public, my perception is that there are some generalizations and simplifications which are not well supported.  But overall, an excellent book.  Bought it to my kids and to my management team at work.
B00006AUIG|3.0|This movie has an original story line, which made it interesting. However, the acting was wooden and the pace of the movie felt slow and plodding. I guessed part of the ending pretty early in the movie, which made getting to the conclusion feel even longer. The tapes that Mike finds really aren't explained or elaborated on, even though the movie is named Session 9, after the last \\"shocking\\" tape. The feel of the movie is definitely eerie, and haunting, with two cringe-worthy scary moments, when I really had to close my eyes. Otherwise, it was pretty mild. Very beautiful location and scenery of the Danvers State Mental Hospital, which I understand was torn down recently. I watched for Halloween, and felt a little let down when it was over. Not a bad movie, but not much of a horror film either.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Funny, clever, and did I say Funny?  Great series - REALLY wish they would bring it back.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Hmmmm...I was between 2 and 3 stars on this one. As a \\"scary\\" movie, it's pretty harsh to watch. There were no jump out of your seat moments, or scenes where I was so scared I had to watch the movie from beneath my afghan. It was just harsh. The three lead guys are unlikeable, and so are the skanky girls they pick up. Because of the darkness of the film the moments that could have been somewhat humorous are just gritty (like the roaming band of murderous children).<br /><br />The \\"gore\\" is left up to the imagination, as the film more alludes to images than lets you see them. I couldn't decide if there was some sort of message about the depravity of the very wealthy and the helplessness of the poor, a commentary about...something, or if this was just a gross movie for the sake of being gross. Tough call.<br /><br />Not a moive I will watch again any time soon, but I am not sorry I saw it either (unlike say, The Hills Have Eyes...)
B0000DBJDL|4.0|Not the biggest Pink Floyd fan, but am a fan. This is a great dvd and has some cool behind the scenes footage as well are entertaining live footage. The whoel live in Pompei concept is worth the entire video. Dirty bare hippy feet, drummer dropping sticks mid song, dogs howling...It's a good experience and brings you closer to the action of Pink Floyd and that's what I was looking for.
B00004BZ16|4.0|More than anything else, \\"Sandinista!\\" is the album that sets the Clash apart from the rest of punk, and probably also the rest of rock. There are a couple of clunkers, sure... I don't exactly think that listening to Mr. Gallagher's kid warbling through \\"The Guns Of Brixton\\" is exactly essential listening, for instance. <br /> <br />But. <br /> <br />The stuff that's good is among the best that the Clash, or anyone else, ever recorded. And I think that if you're going to attempt something this ambitious, you're going to fall short from time to time. When it works, and when the band--augmented by a few of the Blockheads, a future Mescalero, and a handful of other friends--is firing on all cylanders, it's nothing short of magic. <br /> <br />For every hit, like the irrepresably funky \\"Magnificent Seven\\" or \\"Somebody Got Murdered,\\" there're two that should have been. \\"Lightning Strikes,\\" \\"Broadway,\\" \\"Charlie Don't Surf,\\" and \\"The Call-Up\\" (among others) are worthy additions to the Clash canon, while some of the tracks also point the way to Joe Strummer's future work with Latino Rockabilly War and the Mescaleros (and some of the other songs serve as blueprints for other artists' sounds; if Brian Setzer never covered \\"Look Here,\\" he should, already). <br /> <br />There's something else to the Clash that you didn't get from a lot of the rest of punk, that started to show itself on \\"London Calling\\" and is even more pronounced here: there's a warmth and compassion, especially to Strummer's material, that you wouldn't get from, say, the Pistols, the Buzzcocks, or the Ramones. <br /> <br />David Byrne remarked once that when you walk down the streets of most cities, you're assaulted by every kind of music imaginable; he complained that you hardly ever hear that in music. This is the exception to the rule; it sounds like someone took a walk down a thriving main street with their ears open, decided they loved every last bit of what they heard, and wanted to see what it'd soundlike all stuck in the blender. So is it uneven? Sure. But if whether or not you're a Clash fan, you owe it to yourself to hear a great band push the envelope. It's a wonderful mess, and a good reminder of all that's possible in music. <br />
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I feel like I have been waiting for this CD forever.  I am not in the least disappointed.  It contains a great selection of songs and some of the most beautiful voices in music, today.<br />All the songs on this CD are wonderful, but there are a few that stand out.<br /><br />The Prayer:  This is a solo by Chloe Agnew and it gave me chills.  She has the sweetest, most enchanting voice.<br /><br />Over the Rainbow:  All the ladies sing this song, their voices blend seamlessly.  The way they harmonize, it's indescribable.<br /><br />Granuaile's Dance, Shenandoah - Pacific Slope: Mairead's fiddle sets a different tone and pace to this CD.  It's impossible not to want to dance to her playing.  Between the fiddle and the bodhran, I am in music heaven.<br /><br />At the Ceili:  I saw the ladies perform this song in concert this summer and I was hoping they would record it.  It is a comical look at dating.  The beat is fast, the lyrics humorous and the singing great.<br /><br />Spanish Lady:  Another song I saw them perform and hoped they'd record.  All the women sing this one and again it is another upbeat, toe tapping, fun song.<br /><br />I received a charm with my CD, its a little silver claddagh, it's cute.  Comes with an explanation of the symbol and what it means.  I don't think there are any songs on this CD that I would skip through.  The only song I am not madly in love with is Sing Out and that's not even skip-able. It's not a bad song; it's just not my favorite. Another thing I like about this CD is that they included the lyrics on the insert, even the ones not in English. This is a wonderful CD and an excellent edition to your Celtic Woman collection.  I can't think of a more gifted group of women.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Excellent CD.  Easy listening with a few upbeat tracks to keep it spicy.  Great CD for background music for a romantic evening or just to put on while cleaning around the house.  Something for everyone on this one!
B000LC4CVA|4.0|Slane Castle is the perfect backdrop for the second Celtic Woman concert on DVD.  The castle is all lit up and the Celtic WomEn are in top form.  This was the first appearance of Hayley Westenra as the newest member of CW.  I have to admit when I heard she was joining the group, my first thought was \\"if it's not broke, why fix it?\\"  I will tell you now, happily, I was wrong.  I really enjoyed listening to her sing and thought she made a nice addition to this group of extraordinarily gifted women. <br /> <br />The music is as wonderful as I had expected and I watched the DVD twice today.  I had the opportunity to see Celtic Woman in concert this summer.  There were several songs that they performed that night that I had never heard them sing.  I remember thinking, I hope they are going to record these.  They did. <br /> <br />The one song I really wanted them to record was \\"At the Ceili\\" a fun little song about women going to a Ceili (party) and seeking out men.  It is upbeat and impossible not to want to clap along or tap your foot.  Meav, Lisa and Orla sing that song and they really look like they are having a good time doing it. <br /> <br />Another favorite was the \\"Pacific Slope.\\"  Mairead is playing her fiddle, with the accompaniment of two dueling bodhran players.  I love when they do that.  The audience is clapping along, while Mairead is dancing around barefooted.   She is quite the performer. <br /> <br />I really expected to hate the song sing out, because other reviewers talked about how cheesy it was.  I didn't hate it.  It's a little chipper, but it didn't make me want to hit the skip button or anything. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful DVD and Slane Castle is a beautiful backdrop.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the repeat of songs from the previous DVD and CD.  They once again performed Orinoco Flow, Danny Boy, Somewhere and You Raise Me Up.  While I love those songs, I was sorry to see them appear again.  The arrangement and everything remained the same.  I would have preferred four new songs. <br />
B00005JPKC|5.0|I went into this movie wondering about how it was like for the other side during the War. This movie is great. It tells and shows the horrors of the war brilliantly. The acting is superb and it deserves the oscars that it will get. I haven't seen Flags but from what I have heard letters is better. I like the film because the focus is on the war. This should be seen by everyone. I just hope that it comes in a two disc set with tons of bonus materials.
B000M341QE|5.0|As I walked out of the theater after seeing this movie for the THIRD time, a guy walked up to me and said, \\"Did you just see the Departed by yourself? But you're a girl!\\" <br /> <br />Sex doesn't matter when you love this kind of action movie! It is brilliantly made, with wonderful characters that are played to the hilt  by each actor. You may be able to figure out what might happen in some places, but there are always surprises you would have never thought coming!  <br /> <br />My title describes what I think of DiCaprio's performance in this movie. He has turned a page in his career and cannot be thought of as a \\"young adult\\" actor anymore. Scorcese seems to have brought out the best in him as they have worked together. His character is believable, and you can definitely feel for this man who wants to do the best he can, but has to deal with a lot of emotional baggage that comes with being an undercover cop.  <br /> <br />Jack (Nicholson) is the disturbing villian once again! This character was tailor made for him. Martin and Leo fought to convince Jack to do this film, and boy, are we glad he agreed! You can see his character, Costello, start to unravel mentally towards the end. I wish he's win SOME award for this! <br /> <br />Matt Damon's character is all the more chilling because of the traditional \\"good boy\\" roles he's had in the past. Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg give the film some good comedic moments while remaining totally immersed in their character. I couldn't help but love Martin Sheen in this movie! The older, loveable cop who wants to make a difference.  <br /> <br />Amazing performances all around! <br /> <br />Scorsese's Golden Globe win for the direction in this film was right on!
0780020685|4.0|If you have ever thrilled to the site of the US Cavalry...or the Apache Nation...or any large group of entities spread out above camera, posing silently on a cliff, waiting to charge down to the valley below (for good or ill); if the tale of a vulnerable town deciding to hire 'em some heroes to protect them from the local villains piques your interest; if you like to see really good acting in the rain; and of course if you are already a Kurasawa afficianado you have this celebrated film to thank.  I liked this DVD version, finding the optional commentary educational, not having known of the background and futures of the other stars like Mifune, and I enjoyed the biography of Kurasawa. The Criterion Editions are helpful for those of us who might not know what great an effect Kurasawa had on the adventure film industry (read: Westerns) and thus could use a little background.<br /><br />The acting is splendid, sometimes farcicle and over the top.  But Kurasawa uses such scenes to build his plot, and reigns in the drama as the thieves and robbers the Samurai are to protct the villagers from begin their raids.  It's a film where courage and strength must wrestle with fear and weakness, on both sides.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|This represents Norahs's third studio CD. With each CD she continues to  <br />stretch her wings and try new material, new directions, and new visions. This CD  <br />is no exception. if you enjoyed her first two CDs, then <br />give this a chance. The first song,  Wish I Could, establishes the tone of the CD.  <br />This is not going to be just another Norah Jones CD, same old same old. Give it  <br />a chance. She definitely grows even more on this CD. Her voice stands out as <br />the main instrument on this CD. Unlike the first, the piano and voice blended <br />together to form her direction. Here she lets you inside of her and shares her feelings. <br />The second song, Sinkin' Soon, starts out with a  playful strum of the banjo and allows <br />for Norah to get a little sassy. It has a great groove to it. She uses more instruments <br />on this CD and it shows. The CD is not afraid to allow her to experience new musical <br />directions, not just jazz, but a more earthy feeling. The third song, The Sea Doesn't <br />Like You, starts with a plaintive piano run and quickly lets Norah's vocals take over. <br />Her vocals are excellent, just the right feel. The fourth song, Until The End, showcases <br />her natural gift, her voice. The fifth song, Not My Friend, offers <br />Norah Jones as we all know her, great voice and excellent phrasing. The sixth song,  <br />Thinking About You, is being heralded as the first single. It has a certain country feel <br />to it, nevertheless, Norah pulls it off. The seventh song, Broken, opens with a short <br />guitar intro that segues right into Norah. It is very introspective.  <br />The eighth song, My Dear Country, is a pure torch song. Norah bears her soul. <br />You hear two instruments, her amazing voice coupled with a piano. The ninth song, <br />Wake Me Up, starts with a distant slide guitar that blends into Norah's voice at just <br />the right moment. Once again she has chosen a stripped down arrangement which <br/>makes the song one of the stronger tracks on the CD.  The tenth song, Be My Somebody,  <br />is more uptempo and offers a playful Norah. The eleventh song, Little Room, starts <br />with Norah counting down. She is just accompanied by a standup base that gives the song <br />a very sparse but full sound. It even has Norah showing off her whistleing ability.  <br />One can not but like this song.  The twelth song, Rosie's Lullaby, starts with an electric <br />organ and showcases Norah's ability to sell a song. Great vocals. The last song one the CD, <br />Too Late, starts with a solo piano riff and eventually teams up with Norah on vocals. It is <br />a very simple, scaled down produced song that once again places Norah's voice, front  <br />and center. Overall, Norah is spreading her wings and not just playing jazz anymore. I <br />applaud her on taking a new vision and taking a chance. The great talent is still there, <br />whether it be Jazz or pop. Norah is growing up musically. She is coming of age.
0439813786|5.0|THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET is art of a high order.  To start with, this book is a beautiful object.  The right dust jacket can definitely sell a book.  The graphite rendering of Hugo in extreme close-up gracing the book's spine and wrapping around the back cover is what drew me to the bookshelf in the first place.  And upon discovering the book's unusual format, I was hooked.  The artwork here does not illustrate the text.  Rather it advances the plot.  It's a little like watching a silent movie and reading title cards...completely appropriate in a story dealing with the origins of cinema.<br /><br />The story lives up to the promise of the packaging.  It is immediately engaging and ultimately touching.  Hugo is the orphaned son of a clock-maker, living in the walls behind a Parisian train station, maintaining the station's clocks, stealing bread and milk to survive, stealing nuts, bolts, and gears to complete a project his father was working on when he died.  His secret existence is threatened as his life becomes entwined with a bitter, old man and a bookish young girl.  It's part graphic novel, part mystery, part coming-of-age.  There are echoes of Pinocchio but with a twist as here it is a lonely boy building an automaton father figure.<br /><br />This is a timeless book about, among other things, time.  This is a book for the ages, and a book for all ages.  The story, the artwork, the writing style, the overall design, all first rate parts of a greater whole, like the precisely crafted mechanism of a fine Swiss clock.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|The story setting is in the 18th century France yet the exact year did not mention in details. I assume it is in the late 18th century. (After the demise of Louis XV, France, on the verge of science revolution while bearing the King's luxurious Rococo deep debt, lived in a contradictory world (Rich & poor, chaos & order, Sir & servants, genius & freak, and blessing & curse.))<br /><br />Grenouille, born in a stench of filthy market, has a gifted nose. Yet, his life is not so blessed with love that he was immediately abandoned by his mother. Year by year, he was obsessed with olfactory excitements, and his uniqueness naturally draws a line between he and the ordinaries. The devoid of his social incompetence is also a barrier to connect the humanity, and ironically such barrier seems common among genius or freaks?!<br /><br />He was sold as a slave working in a tannery. One day, his foray to a city introduces his nostril to numerous enchanting smells with his eyes open, hunting the scent. Soon, it leads to a tragedy to his first victim, a red-haired virgin (red symbolizes passion and love in drama), and the others. Knowing being a perfumer would be able to preserve scents makes Grenouille's heart speeds up. He proves himself to recreate and to concoct the fragrance when opportunity favors him at Giuseppe Baldini's (Dustin Hoffman).<br />O~ A lung full of bliss, le parfum, imbues one's soul. Baldini is amazed by his power, and exploits him in exchanging sublime perfume formulae. (In 18th-century France, perfume is an opulent merchandise and brings a lucrative business.)<br /><br />True beauty that lies within and radiates through body aura is what Grenouille seeks for his perfect perfume. Each woman he captured has a unique quality. He made a perfect perfume by using the essence of the women. Eventually, he was caught and yet escaped from headman's axe with his pheromonic perfect perfume which impulses men and women to perform a big orgy.<br />He could have used his perfect perfume to preserve his own olfactory fiefdom, but it would be a hollow victory for there's no love/soul left to him.

(A metaphor, a message of what he longs for.)<br /><br />His character is more implicit than explicit. A metaphor which carries different meanings to different people. His character can be viewed as a message, a representative of one particular aspect of the feeling of love. Often mistaken for love itself, the hunger, the desperation, and the uncontrollable urge to surrender oneself is the most magical, as well as the most dangerous display among all symptoms of love. However, it is much like the composition of a cuisine dish: it can never have just one ingredient. Love needs a balance. Love encompasses understanding, compassion and a great level of tenderness.<br /><br />This movie reveals the contradiction between extreme and balance.

B0000019PA|5.0|I absolutely love this album! A Great concept album with unparalelled emotion. Mangums voice takes you into his mind and won't let you escape. It's a real shame he stopped right after this. I would pay $50 for a new album by him.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|While I thought the second Xmen was not as good as the first, I found this one to match the standard of the first and even surpass it in some ways.  THe ending, I admit, is somewhat feel-good, but the death of some of the principal characters - one at her own request - make this something special, in the realm of truly excellent hard science fiction.  As such, while bringing out notions about American society with a theme of race and inclusiveness underneath, there is trajedy in these deaths.  Once again, the acting is simply spectacular, and the characters continue to evolve.  That makes this series outstanding, with a beginning and a potential end.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm, even for fans of the comic.  I recognize many of the episodes of this from comics that are 25 years old, but changed into its own art.  You can view all three as a whole, and they completely entertained me on several successive nights.  With Spiderman, these are the best comic book films ever made, not campy and grotesquely silly, but extending the medium to express some genuinely important thoughts about the human condition.  But then, that is Marvel as its best, right down to the hilarious cameos of Stan Lee in each film.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I first heard of this movie when a friend of mine sent me and a few others a very sobering email.  She was very forthright, you need you must see this movie were her words.  I am glad she sent me that email a few months ago and I have wanted to write about this movie for quite some time.<br /><br />The DVD is just downright sobering.  It is sort of a journey for Al Gore, a man whom I now respect a whole lot more than ever before.  This seems now to be his lifes work.  He exhibited passion in what he tells in this documentary.  I have heard a lot about the other side of the story, but really folks, we have to do something about the environment.<br /><br />Seemingly, we will be inconvenienced either by a disaster or doing something immediately to avert it.  Gore touches so many things, his life, his life's work, the effect of tobacco farming on his family.  The movie is an autobiographical sketch of a man with a desire to see this earth survive for all of us.<br /><br />There is some politics in it for sure. He is a politician.  But the sobering facts are there, whether 100% accurate or not, there is definately quite a lot we have to do to solve our environmental problems.  He claims it is not too late, but my question is, when will it be?<br /><br />I have heard the opposite side of the arguements, even one thing not in the context of global warming that in Scotland in the past there was a time when they had a wine industry because it was so warm.  There was also a time in history prior to Europeans in the Americas where the native population could walk across the NY bay in winter because it was so cold.  Gore answers this with a chart of the cold and warm periods across the centuries.  My questions and doubts were stopped right there.  He had me.<br /><br />MAYBE ONE FAULT:<br /><br />If there is anything I would like to caution someone who sees the movie to think about it is this.  The movie claims it is bipartisan and yes, it is a very bipartisan issue.  In the movie you have scenes of Reagan, Bush I and Bush II denouncing something to do with the environment but we are not totally sure of the context.<br /><br />ONE QUESTION:<br /><br />Mr. Gore speaks of all the years where he was resisted in his quest to get this addressed and I am sure he was resisted and has been rebuffed again and again.  Yet, his first two years as a VP the Dems had control of the Legislative and Executive, he does not address the dynamics of that time and he seems to indicate the resistance is mostly a Republican one.  I hope that some day we get a view of what occurred during that time when he may have had an opportunity to proceed.<br /><br />Finally, we have been warned and we as a people must make the right choices starting now to improve our chances of surviving and thriving in the years, decades and centuries ahead..

B000KGGLCU|5.0|This album makes me so happy! Why on earth did it take Madonna so long to start releasing live albums?! \\"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\\" came out a couple of years ago, and it was absolutely fabulous. I'm guessing that's why \\"The Confessions Tour\\" was released, and I am so glad that it was! The CD features 13 songs from the \\"Confessions\\" tour that were recorded during a performance in London. The quality of this album is fantastic! Every time I listen to it, I feel like I'm in the audience watching Madonna performing. Yes, these tracks are mostly all songs from the \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" CD, but they're live and remixed and different and wonderful! In addition to new favorites like \\"Hung Up,\\" \\"Jump,\\" \\"Future Lovers,\\" and \\"I Love New York,\\" the album also includes some classic old-school Madonna songs, such as \\"Lucky Star,\\" \\"Erotica,\\" and \\"Like a Virgin.\\"<br /><br />Picking a favorite track on this CD is almost impossible, but I think I have to go with \\"Music Inferno.\\" It's such a fun new take on a fabulous Madonna song, and it was also one of my favorite parts of the \\"Confessions\\" tour. (Those white John Travolta suits were fantastic!)<br /><br />I really wish the song \\"Get Together\\" was on the CD, but at least it's on the DVD. And speaking of the DVD...WOW! It's absolutely fantastic. The DVD features many more songs than the CD and also includes several behind-the-scenes bonus features.<br /><br />\\"The Confessions Tour\\" is a dazzling musical experience that's a must-have for all Madonna fans!
B0002VB24K|4.0|This time there is nearly nothing wrong with the movie in itself: we have a neat, consistent, well crafted adventure, not a masterpiece but highly enjoyable, a movie to be watched again and again, which is good because I use DVDs to better my English and therefore appreciate movies that bear re-watching.<br /><br />This time yet the film completely betrays not only the plot, altered everywhere, but the spirit of the book it comes from.<br /><br />The third episode of Ms Rowling's saga is flawed (see my review of the book), packed with disorderly events and emotions, difficult to screenplay, but the movie not only simplify the plot, it disfigures the characters.<br /><br />In the book many of them are given interesting depths and or looked upon with cutting sarcasm, among them Hermione, Snape and Professor Trelawney but the movie does not allow us to glimpse them: the actors are all good but they cannot play what is not on the script and this time the script has hatched roughly.<br /><br />I find this a severe disappointment but the film in itself is quite good, therefore the four stars.
B000GY729M|3.0|If you've been reading reviews of this album, chances are you've seen a lot of people calling it a work of genius, and a lot of people calling it a wagonload of [you know]. Personally, I think it's neither, and I'd like to offer a more balanced assessment for the benefit of the undecided record-buyer.<br /><br />First, the cons: If the first Killers record teetered on the edge of overproduction, this one goes over the edge hard and fast. It's very slick, and there is too little continuity between the songs - it ends up sounding more like a compilation than an album. Brandon Flowers' voice, which worked strangely well on their debut, sounds a little out of place on this one. The arrangements don't mesh well: is it stadium rock, or is it synth rock, or is it some kind of Springsteen-influenced country-rock thing? I get the impression that the band was pulled in all three directions at once, while trying too hard to make a diverse and epic masterpiece. Also, this may be a personal thing, but I find the artwork uniquely ugly. The bighorn sheep (or whatever it is) next to the mannish prom queen, in front of a trailer, makes for an asymmetrical cover with various unpleasant associations but no apparent meaning.<br /><br />The pros: I was afraid that the Killers would turn into a vapidly commercial bubble-gum group, of, say, Daniel Powter caliber. It happens to a lot of bands on major labels; but fortunately, not this time. That slightly sick, slightly twisted *something* that set the Killers apart to begin with is still here. There's nothing quite as unsettling as \\"Midnight Show,\\" mind you, but you still get the feeling that these guys have a real dark side, which goes a long way toward making them more interesting than their peers. The songs, in terms of writing, are less solid than those on Hot Fuss, but they are energetically performed and (mostly) have good melodies.<br /><br />Bottom line: I recommend it if you are prepared to forgive some serious shortcomings, including its being nothing like Hot Fuss. I get the feeling that the band was anxious and uptight while they were making it, like maybe the record executives were looking over their shoulders the whole time; but, I've heard worse, and still I think the Killers are a band to watch.ike Hot Fuss.

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins is a prominent scientist and the world's most prominent atheist and here builds a case for his belief in the irrationality of God and the harm such religious pursuits have inflicted on the world throughout history. THE GOD DELUSION is a hard-hitting attack on religious thinking so you might be surprised to find it reviewed under 'Spirituality': in fact it's a book both atheists and spiritualists should read and consider: it examines concepts of God in all his forms throughout history and considers which aspects of belief are downright dangerous. It's not illogical that such a book would be included in both the general public library or the religious collection.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  My friend and I were hysterical at the end because it is clear that \\"grandpa\\" knew what the real deal was in the child beauty pageants and pulled out all the stops in training his granddaughter.  Her innocence while depicting the underlying truth that few face about the weirdness of child pageants makes the film.  And it turns out that despite the family dysfunction people always talk about in this film, it is clear that she - and each member of the family - is loved for who she actually is and not for who they pretend to be.  <br /> <br />I think it's brilliant.  And I laughed so hard I had to put my face in my hands because it hurt. <br />

0316172324|4.0|For a book essentially about good intuition and snap decisions, \\"Blink\\" is a little full of itself. The self-importance starts right on the cover: \\"Blink\\" bills itself as an illustration of the \\"power of thinking without thinking.\\" Although it provides some insights for understanding how, in only a glance, certain professionals (art curators, military strategists, gourmet food tasters, etc.) develop a \\"gut feeling\\" before weighing every conceivable strand of evidence, \\"Blink\\" offers nothing to improve your own intuition and decision making skills.  <br /> <br />One of the concepts Gladwell explores is \\"thin-slicing,\\" the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience. You might not conceive that a 15-minute videotape of a mundane conversation with your spouse has anything particularly relevant to say about your love life. According to Gladwell and his narration about psychologist John Gottman, however, you'd be wrong. Gottman videotaped hundreds of volunteer couples discussing a point of contention in their marriage: money, sex, pets, etc. Then he broke down behavioral responses to these discussions into groups and represented them in a mathematical form, leading to...boom!...a prediction as to whether that marriage would last.  <br /> <br />Sounds like a stretch? Gottman followed up to see whether his calculations had made the right prediction. They sure had--with an astonishing 90 percent success rate. As a result of his experiments, Gottman reputedly could predict the future of a couple only by overhearing snippets of their conversation at a restaurant. The take-away lesson from this story may sound pedestrian, but practice makes perfect. The author is to be credited for at least drumming up some off-the-beaten-track examples to buttress his message.  <br /> <br />Additionally, Gottman's story highlights another idea in \\"Blink\\": that less is more and overloading decision-makers with information mayoften hamper their reasoning. If the scientist had asked his subjects about the state of their marriage, they might lie or feel awkward or--more importantly--they may be unaware of the truth. Instead, the author claims that by thin-slicing, Gottman found a much quicker path to the truth.  <br /> <br />Similarly, the example of Chicago's Cook County ER reinforces this idea in another context: the importance of a snap diagnosis of heart attacks to save lives. There, a doctor identified three major risk factors based on which a recommended treatment was to be followed. His algorithm, although more simplified than experts in the medical community felt comfortable with, guessed right more than 95 percent of the time compared to 75-89 percent when more laborious testing was conducted. This time out, Gladwell concludes that truly successful decision making lies in the balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking: while deliberate thinking and extensive experiments work well when we have the luxury of time, rapid cognition and the ability to thin-slice are called for when frugality matters.  <br /> <br />Next, there is the story of a man gifted at reading facial expressions who made a fortune at horse races just by getting a good look at horses' faces before races. The ability to absorb and detect minute changes in facial expressions, Gladwell suggests, allows us to essentially \\"read minds.\\" There are several chapters on how reliable we can be in predicting behavior with very little information. <br /> <br />Then there is the tale of Amado Diallo, an immigrant, who was shot 41 times by policemen wrongfully suspecting him of criminal behavior on the doorsteps of his own house in the Bronx. Given that the police failed to read Diallo's facial expressions and body language, the case study appears to confirm the theory that people are guided by stereotypes and prejudices when making split-second decisions. Moreover, Gladwell goes further to suggest that stressful situations lead to a temporary condition of autism that hinders our ability to interpret others' actions and intentions.  <br /> <br />Such tales are entertaining--and certainly make for a fast read--but they come across as mere anecdotes, cherry-picked to bring a little liveliness to what might otherwise be humdrum common sense. The book teems with references to scientific studies, as if we need science to understand the importance of reading faces to understand people's true motivations and feelings.  <br /> <br />The numerous--and seemingly incoherent--illustrations discussed by Gladwell all relate to snap decision-making skills - the kind that help managers react swiftly in high-pressure situations and anticipate people's actions by carefully observing their faces. At the end of the book, the author devotes a chapter to the problem of stereotypes, which, he implies, may deprive us from controlling what surfaces from our unconscious. But do they? Gladwell maintains that we do have control over the environment in which rapid cognition takes place and thus we can steer our decisions away from preconceived notions. Thus, the power of thin-slicing works only in combination with a cognitive realization of all the stereotypes we have grown up with - which contradicts his thesis in the very subtitle of \\"Blink\\".

B00005JPKC|5.0|It is quite amazing how a director as classically American as Clint Eastwood can make such an emotionally audacious film about the Japanese defense of Iwo Jima during the last year of WWII and manage to do it purely from the Japanese perspective. The idea of showing the adversarial side of the war is not new (1970's \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" comes to mind), but what makes Eastwood's historical epic unique is the intense infusion of humanism that courses through the story and the lack of personal judgment on the suicidal Japanese military strategy at the time. There are neither heroes nor villains on either side. The result is an empathic study of a group of men caught in an inevitably fatalistic situation. Leading the effort is Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, an honorable, aristocratic man who has a biding respect for Americans based on his travels there during the late 1920's. With neither air nor naval support forthcoming, Kuribayashi concludes that his troops will need to fight to the death.<br /><br />The central figure among the soldiers is an obstreperous young private named Saigo, who has left a wife and infant daughter back home. Along with the rest of his troop, he spends weeks excavating tunnels and trenches on the higher grounds of the island. The scope of the incoming U.S. fleet exceeds their worst fears, and the rest of the film focuses on how they face the depletion of ammunitions and rations while realizing defeat and death are at hand. We see brief flashbacks of defining moments in their lives back home, just enough to give their reasons for being there but not to the point where we get fully realized characters. I believe this was an intentional move by the filmmakers to focus on the more immediate emotional responses to sacrificing themselves for a greater good, which comes down to buying more time for the empire to win the overall war.<br /><br />Similar to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", the film is dramatically shot by Tom Stern in desaturated, monochromatic tones that give it a black-and-white, documentary-like feel with the bomb explosions primarily in vivid color. The cast is headed by the only recognizable actor to American audiences, the charismatic Ken Watanabe, who effectively plays Kuribayashi with economic authority. As Saigo, J-Pop star Kazunari Ninomiya really holds the film together through his character's serendipitous circumstances, while effective turns are provided by Tsuyoshi Ihara as the erudite Baron Nishi (the former Olympic equestrian champion); Shido Nakamura as the belligerent and increasingly desperate Lt. Ito; Ryo Kase as the stoically vulnerable Shimizu; and Yuki Matsuzaki as Saigo's smiling comrade Nozaki.<br /><br />Japanese American writer Iris Yamashita penned the forceful screenplay based on a story by her and Paul Haggis based on a published book of the picture letters Kuribayashi sent to his family and depicted in the film. While the technical aspects of this historical reenactment are superlative, not to mention the fact that the linguistic barriers between the Japanese cast and American crew must have been daunting, this masterful work really shows how the autumnal Eastwood knows like no other director how to convey the gravitas of impending death without sacrificing the propulsive drama and human heart at the core of the story. Be forewarned that some scenes are invariably graphic and that a few of the subtitles have been obscured by the intermittent use of a white background.matic tones that give it a black-and-white, documentary-like feel with the bomb explosions primarily in vivid color.

0553383663|4.0|The google story brings what the title promisses. The story of google, or should I say, the beginning of the story of google since it's such a young company still.<br /><br />The book starts with the start of google and tells the background of the Google founder, Brin and Page. It explains how they met and how they left their study at Stanford to start Google. How they got their funding and especially the interesting and peculiar things they did to get it. The book portraits the founders as really driven in their work. The later chapters are less chronological and more related to some topics. Some of the chapters were very interesting, some of the chapters were somewhat boring. The later chapters tell less about how google as a company grew. It doesn't tell how it was managed and doesn't tell how and if the culture changed. In my opinion, the book could have been more interesting by going more in the details of these things. In that sense, the book was dissapointing.<br /><br />However, I found the book well written. I finished it within 10 days, and that was just spare time reading. The book made me put some other books put aside and kept me curious till the end. So, well done.<br /><br />4 stars because of the missing opportunity to tell more about the inside of google. Nice story book though.
B000JBXXZ4|2.0|This, besides the \\"hit\\" (Anna Molly), is not a good album at all.  Incubus, at one time, were probably the best band in the world.  When I compare albums like \\"Make Yourself\\" and \\"Morning View\\" to their latest 2 albums, it's like it's not even the same band.  The songwriting has gotten weak, the music sounds rather noisy and boring (besides, why isn't Mike Einziger playing a PRS anymore?  Fender Jaguar's or whatever they are have a really crappy sound). <br />\\"A Crow Left Of The Murder\\" was a major let-down for me, who was a huge fan of Incubus until that album came out.  I should've known that this album would've been equally as bad if not worse, but, instead I wasted 14 dollars. <br />Incubus needs to stop trying so hard to sound \\"different\\" and stick to their older sound.  That's what the fans really liked and that's what SOLD!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Celtic Woman opened my eyes to Celtic music. This DVD picks up where the other one left off.  Orla does a wonderful version of Cerricfergus, which is also on her first solo effort. Cerrickfergus reminds me of The water is wide, which also appears on her first solo CD.  Orla plays the harp very well and to me has the best Celtic accent of the bunch.  Meav does a version of Dulaman, which to me is possibly the finest song on the DVD/CD. Dulaman reminds me of Si Do Mhaimeo i. Meav also does the Last Rose of Summer with Chloe. This song is subpeb. Meav is well known throughout the Celtic world and it's no wonder why.  Meav's voice is in top form. When Meav sings she seems to flirt with the audience in a very playful manner.  Lisa does Caledonia and The Voice which are also outstanding performances and are well worth the listen. My Blessing is another song that she does and it is nothing short of superb. Lisa remains my favorite vocalist of the bunch.   Mairead to me again steals the show. She does a poignant version of Shendoah and then leads into a very lively version of Pacific Slope. She also does a wonderful version of Garnuaile's Dance. Mairead like the first concert is a ball of fire and a delight to watch. Mairead has to be seen to be believed. She is a show within a show.  The biggest problem with me is the additon of Hayley Westenra. Hayley who does have a nice voice, in my opinion adds very little to the group. My biggest problem is her version of Scarborough Fair. Scarbrough Fair of course is a traditional song. The original version had around ten versus.  Hayley only sings the same three verses that Simon and Garfunkel used on their version, infact she only does two of the verses. For me this is a real disappointment. I was hoping for a more traditional arrangement, instead of a remake of a popular song.  Another problem for me is the version of Somewhere over the Rainbow.  Even though the song is sung in A capella and has good harmony, it seems out of placeto me. At this point the concert loses its Celtic charm and becomes Hollywood for one song. There are also remakes of songs from the previoius Celtic Woman CD such as Orrinoco Flow and Your Raise me Up. As much as I like the songs I really dont think they  need to be repeated on this performance. I know they are very popular and were sung on the performance. These young women are possibly the most talented singers in the world. It at least would be very hard to argue that.  This overall is an outstanding performance. It is at least as good, if not better than the first. At a time when great music is very hard to find, this is a real gem. Sit back take a deep breath and relax.

B000KRNCYY|4.0|On the day A New Journey was released to the public, I had to make the choice of buying the CD or the DVD.  The choice proved to be very simple because the CD is so incomplete. Several of the best songs in the performance are not included. I later found the Deluxe version on sale at another store. I would recommend the Delxue version to anyone and everyone.  Orla does a wonderful version of Cerrickfergus which is already on her solo album. Cerrickfergus reminds me of The Water is Wide. Her harp playing is ourstanding. She is a superb musician with a terrific voice.  Meav does my favorite song on the entire performance Dulaman. This song to me is in the same mode as Si Do Mhaimeo i. Meav who in my opinion does not have the best voice of the group, certainly is the most polished performer.  Meav flirts with the crowd as she puts in an outstanding performance.  Lisa who is my favorite singer of the bunch does Caledonia, The Voice and my favorite, The Blessing. Lisa has a very pure natural voice.I simply cannot get enough of Lisa. Mairead as usual steals the show. She does a very poignant version of Shendoah which leads into a very lively version of The Pacific Slope. The problem with this is, they are both omitted on this CD. In order to get the recording you have to buy the Delux CD. Spanish Lady and At the Ceilli are also omitted.   She also does another great song Granuaile's Dance. She is literally a show within a show. She has to be seen to be believed. What a superb violinist.  Chloe as usual sings very well. Chloe has a very sweet first soprano voice.  My biggest problem with the concert is the addition of Hayley Westenra.  Hayley has a very fine voice, but in my opinion she adds very little to the performance.  My biggest problem is her rendition of Scarborough Fair. She takes a traditional Celtic folk song with many verses and does the same three that Simon and Garfunkel recorded. She infact only does two verses. I would have liked to hear some of the other verses. I was hoping for a more traditional version of the song.  Somewhere over the Rainbow is sung A Capella and even though the harmony is superb, it seems very hollow to me. It seems almost like a Broadway production of the song. Somehow it loses its Celtic Charm.  At a time when great music is very rare this CD is a real gem, a real find..........Enjoy

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I would honestly recommend that everyone see this movie.  I actually spent most of the movie trying not to cry.  If you don't believe in global warming, this may be a bit of a wake up call.  I viewed it at my university, with a panel discussion of experts following.  None of them disputed the accuracy of the movie, rather, the consensus was that it was actually a conservative estimate of what will probably happen in the next 50 years.  Scary.

B00005JPE7|4.0|In the wake of Adrian's death Rocky is living a lonely life.  His kid won't have much to do with him because he blames his own shortcomings on the shadow cast by his father.  Rocky seems to be living a normal life on the outside but is being eaten away by the grief he has since Adrian has gone. <br /> <br />Another part of the story is Mason Dixon, the current heavweight boxing champ.  He is struggling with unpopularity because he has not fought any worthy competitors.  He is being run around by his agents and doesn't like it. <br /> <br />A computer simulation shows how the current champ (Dixon)would have done against Rocky and he would have lost by KO in the 13th round.  This simulation gets rocky motivated to fight again but only on a small scale.  Dixon's promoters see a chance to raise the champ's popularity and quickly arrange a fight between Rocky and Mason Dixon. <br /> <br />All in all this movie was really good and made up for the one that I will not dignify by name here.  They consequently leave out just about any trace of that unfortunate film.  This movie gives more exposure to the emotional and psychological background of Rocky and Paulie (Burt Young, who did an awesome job in this movie). <br /> <br />If I were to give a criticism of this movie it would be in Mason Dixon's development as a boxing titan.  At no point in this movie do you get a sense that he is as dominating as they try to make him out to be.  In the other movies Rocky fought monsters, any one of which would have by appearances absolutely destroyed Mason Dixon.  The only opponent that might not have beaten him would have been Spider Rico, whose character makes a comeback in this movie.  From what the way the movie is written there is no way that Dixon would have stood a chance against Rocky in his prime.
B00005JMAH|5.0|this will be a somewhat biased review as i have only seen the movies and not read the books yet. Having said that \\"Prisioner of Azkaban\\" is my favorite of the four Harry Potter movies.  <br /> <br />The plotline is very wonderfully done; It has a very frightening sense of immediatacy that kept me on the edge of my seat till the end. The intricate way each part of the plot is laid out, waiting for the viewer to discover it's place in the grand scheme of the movie is fantastic, dark, but with an intellgence behind it to explain why it is what it is. Nothing about the story is sacrified for the sake of attracing younger viewers.  <br /> <br />Also adding to it's likability is that Harry, Ron and Hermonie are no longer young children, but adolescants, still young and ackward at moments, but adapting more to their roles as wizards. Especially liked was the growth of Hermonie. Up until this movie, she seemed to play a major role in simply foiling Ron and Harry's plans with her constant sense of logic. In \\"Azkaban\\" she has aged and matured, taking away her childish know-it-all-ism, and replacing it with wit and intelligence. Also loved is the stage of ackwardness that accompaines anyone as they become a teenager - including all the confusion and first crushes/loves (Ron and Hermoine, Harry and Hermonie). It's very refreshing to watch characters grow up in such a real way. <br /> <br />I give this movie a wonderful rating, it is a fantastic ride worth taking.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|the film starts off serious-ish. it then moves into a sortof hillarious standpoint...very funny...the film ends funnier than any movie that i've ever seen...wow...i wont tell you how it ends because that would ruin it for you...this film has made it onto my favorite movies and my favorite comedys lists...you must get this film...its about a little girl [olive] who has a dream of becoming little miss sunshine [basically miss america but for little girls]. they dont have much of a way to get her to California to compete so they end up having to drive...the main charecter is not the little girl though. the main charecters are her and her family...who happens to be very disfucntional...there is a son who has taken a vow of silence until he is an air force test pilot, a [crazy] dad who is obsessed wil his 'refuse to lose program', a mother who is just trying to keep it all together, and grandpa who is a druggie and is also teaching olive to dance in her talent section of little miss sunshine, and the uncle who tried to kill himself over his man-lover...[eewww, but very funny]. the basic story is about them getting to California and competing...there are othe little stories in it too...
0694003611|5.0|This book is a great bedtime classic that stands the test of time.  I remember fondly and vividly having this book read to me as a child and the warm and cozy feelings of being safe and sound and ready to be tucked away to bed that it evoked.  Rereading it now, as an adult to my son, I've noticed that part of the appeal may be the contrast and back and forth between the simple black and white pages and the detailed colorful (yet nighttime muted) room.  This seems to capture my son's attention.  On a humorous note, someone pointed out to me recently that the old lady whispering hush (rhymes with mush) is really a large rabbit in a dress.  Just makes this great classic all the more whimsical and appealling!
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I have not seen every film adaptation of Jane Eyre but I have seen a number of them and while I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that this version takes certain modern liberties (more on that later) I do believe it gives a perpective of Jane and Edward's relationship that has not been seen before. I thought the beginning very creative, the end at Ferndean Manor satisfying, and appreciated the inclusion of the Gypsy scene. Also, I appreciated that Stephens' Rochester was mutli-layered. Many previous versions of this story place the burden on the viewer to reconcile Jane's attraction to a dark, brooding, crass man. At least in this version a context is created whereby the viewer finds themselves recognizing the good that triumphs over bad in his character--beneath the prickles and barbs of his exterior. <br /> <br />However, I do agree that a certain modern sensibility was imposed on this version especially once their love is pronounced. While the retrospects are titilating, they diverge from the text almost completely. Where was Rochester's fiery, violent temperament?! Where was Jane's resolve?! Instead Rochester is attempting to seduce a passive Jane into becoming his pseudo-wife with whispers and caresses! Very out of character. There is no attention paid to Jane's Christian moral center which weakens this version's Jane over others (I am reminded of the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version). <br /> <br />However, aside from this I was overall pleased with the film. I thought it had a good pace, a strong chemistry between the main actors, and a mostly honest adaptation. If you enjoy this story I think you will find this film satisfying.
0399226907|5.0|This is a real classic, a must have.  Eric Carle's illustrations are, as usual, great.  Also, children love the concept of the different sized pages as the caterpillar eats his way through the book.  My son loves to reach out and try to grab at each page.  It's such an wonderfully simple read and such a charming tale for young ones.  My son never tires of reading this classic over and over again.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|No matter how you Approach this movie , You'll definitely have to talk about the charecters and the Actors. You see they all have been picked up very carefully so each Actor suits his role more than what you can imagine. Look at the main charecter \\"Eisenheim\\" The great magician his role is being played by Edward Norton and Who doesnt Know him! The sexy american actor , Amazing performance , Exiptional Accent which i think is his real accent ! And there's also Sophie the the Highly Sophisticated english duke and her charecter is played by jessica biel ,Goregeous Actress with a cold tone ..And one last main charecter which i believe should be mentioned is the Inspector Uhl played by Paul Giamatti his attitude and beard suits amazingly..<br /><br />The Story *Plot Out-line* (Spoilers)(From a trusted site)<br /><br />Based loosely on the Steven Millhauser's story \\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\\", The Illusionist tells the story of Eisenheim (Norton), a magician in turn-of-the-century Vienna. The film begins in medias res as chief inspector Uhl (Giamatti) recounts the history of Eisenheim for Crown Prince Leopold, following Eisenheim's arrest during what appears to be necromancy passed off as a magic show.<br /><br />As a teenager, Eisenheim is the son of a carpenter. One day, he meets a traveling magician along a road. The magician performs several tricks for him and then, according to various accounts, both the magician and the tree he was sitting under vanish. Eisenhim becomes obsessed with magic tricks after this and also falls in love with Sophie (Biel), a duchess well above his social standing, and the daughter of the parents that have hired Eisenheim's father as a cabinet-maker. Although the two are forbidden to see each other, they meet in a secret hideout in the woods, where Eisenheim tells of his plans to go to China to learn more magic and Sophie promises to go with him. On the day that they are going to leave, however, the police come looking for Sophie. The two hide in the secret room and Sophie begs Eisenheim to make them both disappear. He is unable to fulfill this request, however, and the two are separated. Eisenheim leaves his village to travel the world and perfect his magic after this. He returns a master illusionist, only to find that Sophie is expected to marry the ruthless Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell), who is well known for abusing his lady friends. After humiliating the crown prince during a private show, Eisenheim finds his hit performance shut out of Vienna. Eisenheim and Sophie, having recognized each other at a performance, meet privately and finally consummate their love. Their romance begun anew, they plan to elope; but first, Sophie points out, something must be done to stop Leopold, who, she reveals, is planning a coup d'etat to take control of Austria from his aging father, the emperor, while using his engagement to her to win the support of Hungary. When Leopold finds out from Uhl, who was following the couple, he kills Sophie in a drunken rage. Unfortunately, Leopold's aristocratic social standing makes any accusations against him unthinkable. As Eisenheim plunges into despair and the citizens of Vienna begin to suspect Leopold of murder, Uhl begins to observe Eisenheim's actions more closely.<br /><br />Racked with grief, Eisenheim prepares a new kind of magic show, using mysterious equipment and Chinese stagehands. Eisenheim purchases a run-down theater and opens a new performance. During his show, Eisenheim apparently summons spirits, leading many to believe that he possesses supernatural powers. Uhl attempts to stop his show but is unsuccessful.<br /><br />Leopold decides to attend one of Eisenheim's shows in disguise. During this show, Eisenheim summons the spirit of Sophie, who says someone in the theater murdered her, panicking Leopold. Uhl pleads with Eisenheim to stop, but Eisenheim refuses; he is bent on being with Sophie and ruining the crown prince and the ruling Habsburg house. Finally, Leopold orders Eisenheim's arrest, but when Uhl tries to arrest him during a live show, Eisenheim's body fades and disappears, implying that he did not perform the show as a corporeal human being that night but, rather, as a \\"spirit\\".<br /><br />At this point, we return to the first scene of the movie. Uhl reveals to Leopold that he has found evidence which points to the crown prince as Sophie's murderer, two jewels from the prince's sword. After ordering, then begging Uhl to keep silent, Leopold discovers that Uhl has already informed the emperor's general staff not only of his findings but of Leopold's plans to usurp the Austrian throne. When the general staff arrives at his palace, Leopold shoots himself in despair after sadly reflecting on the state of Austria's corrupt government.<br /><br />In the next scene, Uhl is shown leaving the imperial castle. After he takes a few steps, a boy runs up to hand him a folio labeled \\"Orange Tree\\" - the name of one of Eisenheim's illusions which had intrigued Uhl. Uhl demands to know where the child found the folio and is told that Eisenheim had given it to him. Uhl spots Eisenheim wearing a disguise and follows him to the train station. During his chase, Uhl begins to make mental connections, shown in the form of flashbacks.<br /><br />The first shows Eisenheim surreptitiously arranging travel plans for Sophie. This is followed by a quick flash of the conversation between Sophie and Leopold - this time, though, we are shown that Sophie had drugged Leopold so that he would pass out for a short time in the stables. She is then seen taking a green gem from his sword (which Uhl would find later and mark as evidence) and leaving it on the stable floor along with a wooden locket that Eisenheim gave her.<br /><br />The next flashback shows Sophie putting blood on Leopold's sword and collapsing on her horse as if she were injured. Uhl then recalls that the royal family's doctor, who had told him Sophie was dead and had \\"found\\" a red gem in her clothing, looked extremely similar to a man he had spotted helping Eisenheim plot Sophie's escape. This quickly cuts to a shot of Eisenheim giving Sophie a potion that makes her suddenly wake from a deathlike state, in the same fashion as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />Another flashback follows, at the private show Eisenheim performed for Leopold and his guests. During one trick, Eisenheim re-created the story of King Arthur, using Prince Leopold's sword in the role of Excalibur. While handling it, Eisenheim surreptitiously removed a red gem embedded in the sword - the gem later found on Sophie's \\"dead\\" body.<br /><br />Uhl realizes the truth: everything was an illusion. Sophie's death was staged, to prevent Leopold from pursuing the lovers and from executing his coup; by arranging the \\"murder\\" of Sophie and his own \\"magical\\" escape, Eisenheim fulfilled Sophie's wish of fifteen years prior - to \\"make us disappear\\".<br /><br />Uhl is shown laughing at his epiphany, delighting in Eisenheim's clever and complicated ruse (it is implied that he believes Eisenheim is the greatest illusionist ever). Uhl delights in his realization he is no longer under Leopold's threatening, violent, maniacal control. The final scene shows Eisenheim arriving at a secluded cottage in the mountains where Sophie is waiting. He returns her locket (which he snuck out of Uhl's pocket earlier) and the lovers embrace and share a kiss, ready to begin their new life together.<br /><br />And in The end This is Highly recommended DVD infact if there's a DVD worth having then this would be top the list ..10/10!<br /><br />Trust me you wont be disappointed :) especially  with amazons great service ...

0618680004|5.0|I loved this book. I grew up in a Christian environment and the book made me think more about my religion.  I would recommend it to anyone; atheist, Christian, Jewish, etc.  It makes good points and a few bad ones, but his point is made.
0792846443|4.0|The character of Annie Wilkes has got to be the psycho to end all psycho's in movie cinema. Mostly because she is self restrained most of the time, without going overboard, in regards to her \\"home sweet home\\" demeanor, while hiding a carefully guarded skeleton in her demented closet. The biggest tip offs to her unstability is, of course, her outrageous temper tantrums, and her incredible sense of possesion for the things \\"she loves.\\"<br /><br />It's unfortunate for the man she saves, has now become one of her most prized possesions, while he's healing himself in her home thinking help is on the way, but can't due to current snowstorms. She never makes the call.<br /><br />And while he is waiting, she discovers an awful secret of his. The man, who happens to be an author of her favorite literary fictional female character, has come to terms by ending his writing career by killing the female character off in his final book.<br /><br />And that's when hell, breaks loose!
1582701709|1.0|I watched the movie version out of perverse curiosity, becuase someone I know -- who is a serial adherent of new agey philisophies -- was interested in it. <br /> <br />The sheer lack of content was amazing.  One simple message repeated ad-nauseum.  The movie doesn't even have any good sense of progression or climax to it -- just hammering the message from start to finish. <br /> <br />And this is about the least deep message you can find. <br /> <br />This is suitable for the intellectual infatuation of a high school student, but to see that the book is #8 on amazon gives me a deep chill.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Music, sound, color, and motion were what Walt Disney once said about exploring the world of animation. This movie has it all! The pure use of the classical backdrop of Sleeping Beauty Ballet embraces this animated feature with a children's book come to life in a 3D manner, when 3D was looked upon as a cinema gimmick. Don't get me wrong, it's not a 3D movie, but seeing this film on the big screen theatre, makes one feel they have entered those magic castles-firsthand.<br /><br />The gimmick here is to give the three good fairies each a unique color, which they relish, even for their change into peasant women, harboring the young princess in the middle of the forest in order to shield her from the witches curse.<br /><br />The witch, of course, is dark, sinister, and very gothic. Not wanting to give into failure for her announced wicked spell cast upon the young princess since birth.<br /><br />During an outdoor walk, the young princess stumbles upon a male stranger, who happens to be her once betrothed, and whom she is bound to marry. Not knowing he is the prince, and him not knowing she is the princess, they both fall in love with each other amongst cute trailing animals.<br /><br />The miscommunication goes further down the road as they announce their love for each other with the people who have been protecting them, and then think they have fallen for some stranger.<br /><br />It's the witch who becomes the first to find out they have mistakingly bonded, and captures the prince as hostage. (For he alone can break the spell, with love's first kiss).<br /><br />It's not enough that she finally set the spell upon the princess, when she finds out her hostage has been set free. Ultimately transforming herself into a raging demon, in order to thwart his advance towards the Sleeping Beauty Castle. Fine animated tale, and incredible execution style for a film developed in the late 50's.<br /><br />Thank God the home video big screens are getting bigger!
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I am very pleased with this cd. The sound is more like her first cd rather than her second. It sounds like she has gotten back to more of a jazz foundation rather than the fusion of country, pop, etc. in her second album (which I still love both).     About \\"My Dear Country\\" as a knock on the President, the lyrics don't say that at all. I think it is clever satire that is directed towards ALL POLITICIANS. She never singles out the Predisent. I think it's funny. As for the song \\"Sinkin' Ship\\", again Norah Jones never says anything about politics.     I recommend it because Norah Jones is an amazing artist and the music is awesome. Good Quality Jazz.

B000FS9FCG|1.0|When I added V to my net flix queue I had no idea who made it or what it was about. I vaguely remembered commercial trailers on TV for it back in 2005. When I popped it in the DVD player I was appalled at its blatant hatred of the United States and traditional values. And when writing this review I was quite dismayed at the vast majority of other reviewers that either don't understand what this movie is truly about or are so brainwashed by leftist radicals that they cheer right along with V's anti-American, pro-Islamic terrorist propaganda.  <br /> <br />You can read elsewhere for storyline, plot and setting. My comments here are centered on the movie's theme. That is America (the place where any gender, religion, creed or sect is free to pursue their own happiness in any way they see fit) is only one step away from Nazi Germany. Yet, Islamic terrorists (people who mutilate young girls as a matter of religious faith, blow up children, behead civilians, fly planes into skyscrapers, preach and attempt the genocide of entire cultures) are the enlightened one who are to be aligned with to save the world from evil Christians and Conservatives. The whole premise of this movie is sickening. Republican or Democrat, Liberal or Conservative; we as Americans should be outraged and united against people who whose sole purpose is to destroy our civilization. Not supporting them as this film does. <br /> <br />The most pathetic aspect of terrorist sympathizers, those who made and agree with this film, is that they have no concept of what radical Islam would do to them if given the chance. Do they really believe that the likes of Bin Laden and Ahmadinejad would embrace their lifestyles? To terrorists, America haters are useful idiots who would rapidly be dispatched in a radical Islamist State. Just when was the last time you saw a gay pride parade in Iran, for example? V for Vendetta claims that Christians and Conservatives are the totalitarians of the planet. Yet, when was the last time you heard Catholic leaders calling for the destruction of a Masque, or a Jewish Temple? Was it Saddam Hussein or the Pope who paid $25,000 to the families of homicide bombers? Was it al-Zarqawi or Mother Teresa who beheaded Nick Berg? Would the transgendered Wachowski be welcomed as a Muslim? Or would he destroyed along with all the other \\"infidels\\" that radical Islamists have sworn to kill?  <br /> <br /> <br />If you believe that Osama Bin Laden, Ward Churchill, Cindy Sheehan and the like are the moralists in this world; if you believe that the U.S. government staged 9/11; if you ignore the U.S.S. Cole, the WTC bombing, the U.S. Embassy bombing, Al Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbolla's public cry for the destruction of the West; if you are sympathetic to those who are sworn to kill you then this movie is for you. <br /> <br />But, if you recognize that terrorists are the enemies of freedom; that (most people in) western societies do not support fascist religious leaders and their followers terrorizing the world, then stay far away from this film.

B000L43QJ2|4.0|This is the second Swan Lake by the Paris Opera Ballet appearing on DVD. A few years ago Bel Air brought us the Vladimir Bourmeister version, filmed in 1992, with Marie-Claude Pietragalla and Patrick Dupond. Interesting from a choreographic point of view, the production was betrayed by its ungainly designs.  <br /> <br />The present DVD released by Opus Arte documents Rudolf Nureyev's production of Swan Lake, created for the Paris Opera in 1984 - twenty years after his first staging of the ballet for the Vienna Opera Ballet, which is also available on DVD in the famous film with Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn.  <br /> <br />The current Parisian version of Tchaikovsky's most popular ballet has the Nureyev touch all over. Prince Siegfried and his tutor Wolfgang are promoted to central characters and the story is re-told from a Freudian angle: the whole ballet is conceived as a product of the prince's dreams and imagination. One may have mixed feelings about this approach, yet we have to grant Nureyev that he always kept faith in the possibilities of classical dance itself and no matter the personal sidetracks, his Swan Lake remains recognizable as a lyric tragedy.  <br /> <br />The staging is dramatically effective. The costumes by Franca Squarciapino inspired by 15th-century frescoes and the grand neo-gothic sets by Ezio Frigerio are tasteful, sober and unobtrusive, letting the choreography ample space to speak for itself. Nureyev followed the dramatic structure of the canonical Petipa/Ivanov version from 1895, left the pantomime intact and kept parts of the choreography (notably the 2nd Act, the pas de trois and most of the Black Swan pas de deux). For the rest he devised his own, being most successful in the final Act where he preserved the original music, only interpolating an extra farewell duet set to the music of the omitted Act 3 pas de six. Less attractive are a rather long-winded Waltz in Act 1 and the tedious national dances in Act 3. The Prince and Rothbart get extra solos.  <br /> <br />Directed for TV by François Roussillon, the performance was filmed live at the Opéra Bastille in Paris in 2005. The DVD captures the production beautifully, the image quality is outstanding. The editing convincingly mixes longshots from the top of the house, showing the choreographic patterns, with generally well-chosen close-ups of the soloists. Sound (LPCM stereo or 5.1 DTS) is first-rate.  <br /> <br />The main issue with this Swan Lake, however, is the casting of the leading roles, étoiles Agnès Letestu and José Martinez. Not everybody will warm for Agnès Letestu straight-faced rendering of Odette. Her dancing is clean and poised, but she seems to appear from a lake of ice, while her confident persona and stiff-backed plastique enhance an image of remoteness and invulnerability. José Martinez, noble, slim and very tall, isn't the most emotional of dancers either and never succeeds in breaking the ice. The close-ups only emphasize how little interest he seems to find in the role. Like Letestu his dancing is assured and neat, but eventually rather pale. His too reserved personality is at odds with the essentially romantic character devised by Nureyev. Letestu is undoubtedly preferable as Odile. The Black Swan pas de deux demonstrates some superbly controlled dancing, but even here the overall impression is rather one of cold calculation. Premier danseur Karl Paquette isn't the ideal choice either for the dual role of Wolfgang/Rothbart, lacking authority as well as mystery.  <br /> <br />The pas de trois in Act 1 is danced well by Emmanuel Thibault, Nolwenn Daniel, and especially a remarkable Dorothée Gilbert. Company dancing is excellent overall, as can be expected from the Paris Opera. Vello Pähn conducts the Paris Opera Orchestra.  <br /> <br />An illustrated synopsis and a meagre \\"cast gallery\\" are the only bonus features on the DVD. Included is a 28-page booklet with excellent photos from the production and liner notes byFrançois Roussillon, covering the creation and subsequent performance history of Swan Lake as well as Nureyev's lifelong fascination with the ballet and its music. Not everyone will agree with Roussillon's - otherwise anything but original - conviction that Swan Lake and its theme of impossible love is a reflection on Tchaikovsky's own homosexual life. Others will also note that the cast list in the booklet is far from faultless (the on-screen credits only mention the leading dancers): the second soloist in the pas de trois is not Mélanie Hurel but Dorothée Gilbert; while in the Czardas Fanny Fiat and not Dorothée Gilbert performs the female lead. <br />
0618680004|5.0|Obviously Dawkins is right:  Religion is silly.  It's almost too silly to argue about, given that any of the tools that one person could use to argue with another -- reason, logic, evidence -- are useless against faith.  And therein lies the problem.  Dawkins isn't arguing that nothing good can come from religion (despite the unfortunate title of the documentary film that complements this book).  People do good and bad things for all sorts of reasons, and trying to figure out the underlying motives should be left to psychologists.  Rather the question is whether faith is a useful basis for conducting human affairs.  Here's what we know: <br /> <br />Thousands of years of attempts to use faith to understand astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology led nowhere and were supplanted by roughly 200 years of science.  If there is a god, it has had no discernible impact on the physical world. <br /> <br />Thousands of years of attempts to use prayer to influence the health of individual people and their communities have had no effect on either one, and were supplanted by roughly 100 years of medicine.  If there is a god, it doesn't care whether people live or die. <br /> <br />Disputes between people of different faiths tend to get out of control.  The problem is not so much that various bibles tell people to kill each other (although they do).  Rather it is inherent in the notion of faith, which encourages absolute certainty in shaky propositions.  Too often religion has been the spark that converts a minor land dispute into a genocidal crusade.  And no, Dawkins is not saying that faith is the cause of all wars.  And yes, it is a dark irony that all of these tendencies appear to have been inherited from our primate ancestors. <br /> <br />Dawkins is often criticized for being rather surly in his presentation of these facts, and one can argue about whether a softer approach might be more effective.  But ultimately the point has to be made:  We humans have tried very hardand we can detect no evidence that God contributes to human health, knowledge, or peace.  And while this does not absolutely disprove the existence of any particular god or gods, it does suggest that it's irresponsible to act as if the last few centuries of human progress have not occurred.  Especially when you're reading about it on the Internet, for Christ's sake.

I don't think Clapton has done anything exceptional in the electric blues arena in over 20 years. I only review blues, and I was kind of fooled into buying this. One of the blues magazines I subscribe to, had this CD listed under new releases, and I was so hungry for blues I bought it, and was terribly disappointed. But once again, I am honestly saying, all these other people, can't be so far off. They were obviously looking for something else and found it. I am only reviewing this to help those few people out there, like me, that hunger for the Stevie Ray, Albert King, Albert Collins, Luther Allison, Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, electric blues. This CD is not it! I'm not afraid to hurt people's feelings, but, I took the time to write this review, to help the electric blues fans, that are looking, for what I look for. If I helped one of you, please let me know, and I will continue my searching and reporting, for \\"Shaq's, The King Of The World Blues Reviewer's\\" loyal fans. God Bless! Good Night! Shaq has left the Royal Albert Hall, to continue his quest for all good \\"true\\" electric blues!

B000FFJ85I|5.0|A new step toward individuality or the last step to conformity: Decemberunderground has been viewed as both by members of AFI's ever-growing fan base.  However, one thing is for certain; Decemberunderground has a sound different from every other AFI album.  It is much less harsh than the band's previous release, Sing the Sorrow, and a far cry from the intense, acidic compositions on earlier albums such as Black Sails in the Sunset and The Art of Drowning.  Decemberunderground is a great album, but the degree to which you will enjoy it will depend heavily on your past experience with AFI's music.<br /><br />I became an AFI fan at a crucial time for the band's musical identity, just prior to the release of Sing the Sorrow.  With the echoes of songs like Days of the Phoenix still ringing in the collective ears of the fan base, Sing the Sorrow met much of the same criticism as Decemberunderground.  New singles Silver and Cold, Girl's Not Grey, and The Leaving Song Pt. 2 (which was even featured on Madden 2004) dominated the airwaves, and hardcore AFI fans saw their band sliding toward the mainstream.  At the time, Sing the Sorrow was seen as soft, with only about half the tracks consisting of screaming from Davey Havok.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Sing the Sorrow, favoring the more melodic songs as a fan of other popular bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Weezer.  Curious about the other works of AFI, I bought Black Sails in the Sunset and The Art of Drowning.  Here I found something dark, brooding, and fiery.  This was a different AFI, where the \\"Fire Inside\\" was actually projected outward by means of powerful guitar riffs and aggressive, accosting lyrics.  There was a power in the music that I loved, but as an alt. rock guy it was hard for me to grasp the meaning behind the aural onslaught.<br /><br />Then came Decemberunderground, highly anticipated as the old AFI fans wished for a return to old ways and the new AFI fans hoped for more of the same.  The single Miss Murder hit the radio, and as a fairly middle-of-the -road song (as far as intensity), both sides continued to hold their breath for the album's full release.<br /><br />As I said before, Decemberunderground is unlike any other AFI album.  Stylistically, it is slower and softer than any previous work with several songs even having a Cure-esque mechanical back beat.  Now, that's not to say that every song on the CD is apparently harmless, Kill Caustic and Affliction really send the listener back to Black Sails.  But what really sets Decemberunderground apart is the overall conveyance of AFI's musical identity.  The softer, slower songs have something that wasn't there in Sing the Sorrow tracks like Silver & Cold and The Leaving Song which lacked emotion.  Emotion is the key ingredient to the beauty of AFI's music.  The songs on Decemberunderground may not be outwardly raw and intense, but they do convey the concept of having \\"A Fire Inside\\" better than any of AFI's other work.  There is a palpable energy in these songs, an energy that expresses emotion more effectively than loud lyrics and raw guitar riffs ever could.<br /><br />So, in response to the critics, I would say that AFI's Decemberunderground is quite the opposite of conformity.  AFI has truly found a brilliant, unique style for expressing themselves, the choice is yours as to whether you can accept it or not.urder hit the radio, and as a fairly middle-of-the -road song (as far as intensity), both sides continued to hold their breath for the album's full release.   <br />As I said before, Decemberunderground is unlike any other AFI album.

0684824906|5.0|This book ranks right up there with Shelby Foote's wonderful trilogy: \\"The Civil War - a Narrative\\".  \\"Team of Rivals\\" is fabulously written, showing Lincoln's true genius, humility and courage.  I am only half way through it so far and am truly convinced that Abraham Lincoln is without a doubt the greatest public servant this country has ever had.  His ability to ignore past injustices and insults done to him for the sake of the Union are without parallel.  His ability to soothe damaged egos and balance the need of the Radical Republicans, abolitionists, conversatives, weary Democrats, incompetent field Generals and ambitious members of his own cabinet (including the duplicitous Sec of Treasury Salmon Chase) are indeed a testament to Lincoln's character and love for this country.  I have read many books on the Civil War - trust me, you will NOT be disappointed with Goodwin's latest!
0618680004|5.0|You don't have to agree with Dawkins to enjoy his gifted mind. His premise that there is NO GOD is a position that has been held by some of the most gifted intellectuals throughout history. At the same time, many of these renowned minds thought they found God just before their deaths. I have read thousands of books, and I have never heard of anyone who chose to renounce God when they were close to death. Why is that?<br /><br />Why is it that so many atheists have believed in a non-God concept, but find the need to change their minds near life's end? Does one's fear of nothingness overcome their predilections as atheists, when the time comes? The answer is perhaps.<br /><br />If I have a problem with Dawkins, and I do, it is that he is so adamant about his LAW, not a belief, but a law that there is no God. I feel that he goes to the extent of believing that the rest of us who might have such a belief, are rather STUPID. He wants to demonstrate in paragraph after paragraph why such beliefs are naïve, false, and for the simpleminded among us.<br /><br />What Dawkins is pushing for, is that we all have an OPEN MIND when we read his arguments that there is NO GOD. Yet, I find in reading this book, and I have read every word, is that he is closed off to the concept that there might be a GOD. Isn't it really a necessity that if one is a first rate scientist that they maintain an OPEN MIND.<br /><br />Should you read this book if you have a deep and fervent belief in God? The answer is a resounding YES. Don't hesitate. This is a great book, and the reason is that Dawkins is a first rate scientist, with a first rate mind, and a fabulous writer to boot. Don't let my problem with his condescension, and belittling attitude toward religious believers stop you from a great read.<br /><br />Dawkins and this work are important because it gets you to think. You are challenged. You are forced outside the box. No matter what you believe or don't believe, Dawkins is going to rip you out of that chair, and force you to rethink your thoughts, and that is a very good thing. Some of the spellbinding thoughts in this book are:<br /><br />· If you feel trapped in the religion of your upbringing, it would be worth asking yourself how this came about? The answer is usually some form of childhood indoctrination.<br /><br />· The status of atheists in America today is on a par with that of homosexuals fifty years ago.<br /><br />· Any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.<br /><br />· Thomas Jefferson is reputed to have said that, \\"Christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man.\\"<br /><br />· Benjamin Franklin said, \\"Lighthouses are more useful than churches.\\"<br /><br />· Even John Adam's got into the act with, \\"This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it.\\"<br /><br />· The Journalist Roger Sherman asked George Bush Senior if he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists. His answer was, \\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God.\\"<br /><br />· Carl Jung once said, \\"I do not believe, I know.\\"<br /><br />· Arthur C. Clarke the scientist once wrote, \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from MAGIC.\\"<br /><br />· Dawkins even had a sense of humor. He wrote that George W. Bush had said, \\"God told me to invade Iraq.\\" The author then states, and I'm paraphrasing, it's a pity that God didn't tell him there were no weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />I have told you of my difficulties with Dawkins' attitude towards those who are believers. This in no way lessens the value of what he has to say, regardless of how the reader may disagree with it.<br /><br />Dawkins goes after the Bible also in his discussions. He is very pointed and accurate in pointing out discrepancies that take place in the various different texts. It doesn't matter to the believer, but it sure does to Dawkins. For a fuller, and fascinating account of Dawkins' descriptions of the incongruencies in the Bible, you want to read anything written by Bart Ehrman. He is a professor of religion at UNC Chapel Hill, especially his \\"Lost Christianities\\" book.<br /><br />If you are a firm believer in God, than don't be afraid to read Dawkins and the \\"GOD Illusion\\". It will challenge you, and make you a better believer, because now you will have a firm understanding of what the other side thinks, and that's a good thing to have.<br /><br />If you don't believe in God, than this is probably the best book you can read since 1957 when Bertrand Russell wrote, \\"Why I am Not a Christian.\\" For an in-depth look at Christianity, a magnificent book was written by Nobel Peace Prize winner (1952) Albert Schweitzer more than a half a century ago entitled \\"The Quest for the Historical Jesus\\".<br /><br />I like Dawkins. He makes me think. He makes me question. He moves me to a new level, and you are not going to get there by having cocktail party conversations at your neighborhood bar drinking blue Safire martini's. You've got to work for knowledge. You have to struggle for it, and you will be a better believer for the knowledge and the struggle. Good luck.<br /><br />Richard Stoyeckas to say, regardless of how the reader may disagree with it.  <br /> <br />Dawkins goes after the Bible also in his discussions.

B00009P1O0|5.0|First, while there are Neil Young \\"fans\\" who think \\"Harvest\\" is his \\"best\\" album, they aren't the real fans, and they're not the ones who paid the mortgage on the Redwood City ranch. They're Top 40 people, and \\"Harvest\\" was a Top 40 album. On the liner notes to \\"Decade,\\" Young acknowledged that album as the \\"middle of the road\\" and welcomed his return to \\"the ditch.\\" Second, while it's highly inaccurate to say that Neil \\"loves\\" his fans, the truth is that \\"holds them in contempt\\" is a better description (read the book \\"Shakey\\" for starters, specifically the reminiscences of the \\"Tonight's The Night\\" tour. He laughed at the fact that he showed up for these shows drunk and stoned and by doing so ripped off his audience. Whatta guy. Neil cares about Neil...and his family...and anyone else is simply a \\"consumer). Third, while Neil had a big laugh over his \\"lost decade\\" at Geffen and the lawsuit that followed, David Geffen was probably justified in sending a lawsuit his way, because Young ripped off Geffen and everyone who bought a copy of \\"Kinda Fonda Wanda\\" (from the album \\"Neil & The Shocking Pinks.\\") But the Reprise years...especially this album, an overlooked classic...that's why the faithful hang in there. From the feel-good Charles Manson ditty \\"Revolution Blues\\" (\\"Well I hear that Laurel Canyon is full of famous stars, but I hate them worse than lepers, and I'll kill them in their cars\\") to concert stand-bys (\\"See The Sky About To Rain\\"), this is Weird and Moody Neil at 11 on a 10 scale...in short, pure freakin' art without a single nod toward \\"commercialism.\\" Any Neil Young album is a roll of the dice, but this one comes up a winner on all counts.
B00028HBKM|5.0|In my opinion, this movie shows the biblical event with glory and blood. If we consider that Romans were not that \\"polite\\" with criminals or at war, then we can understand why they were so brutal in the movie; not because the Bible says so, but history speaks by it self. Reading the Bible and watching the movie is almost the same, very close. How would you feel if you know you will die tomorrow?

B00005JPAM|5.0|Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II is as finely nuanced a performance as you are likely to see in a motion picture.  \\"The Queen\\" who suffers the woeful ignorance regarding protocol of her new prime minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen,) at Buckingham Palace is not the same woman we see with her family is their retreat at Balmoral any more than that is the same woman who jumps into her old jeep and takes off on her own at the family's Scottish estate.  But the point is that they are the same woman and while the differences between those facets might be ones of minute degree, Mirren has captured them exquisitely, which is why she is now the greatest favorite to win the Oscar in the history of handicapping the Academy Awards.<br /><br />Written by Peter Morgan (whose \\"The Last King of Scotland\\" is probably going to win the Oscar for Best Actor) and directed by Stephen Frears (\\"Dangerous Liaisons\\"), this 2006 nominee for Best Picture is primarily about the week following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997.  For the Queen the death of Diana is a private matter and the fact that Diana was no longer an HRH dictates the crown say nothing even more than a desire not to feed the media frenzy that played a role in her death.  But for Blair (with the help of his speech writer), Diana is the \\"People's Princess,\\" and he can see the threat to the monarchy by the Queen's silence in the face of this national tragedy even if her majesty cannot.  It is the middle class Blair, the first Labour PM in a generation, who has to persuade Elizabeth that her traditional quiet dignity, which has served her so well for a half century as Queen of England, is woefully inadequate to the moment at hand.<br /><br />The flaws of the film are not questions of movie making but exist because of fidelity to the events of that week.  In the immediate wake of Diana's death the paparazzi who relentlessly pursued her are vilified, but when the tabloid rags that paid for all those photographs of the princess turn the growing wrath of the public away from themselves and onto the royal family nobody calls them on their self-serving interests.  If Elizabeth, Charles and the rest of the family thought it was wrong to take the young princes away from Balmoral and back to the circus in London it is hard to fault them for their logic (if they had been at Buckingham palace they might have fled to Balmoral anyhow).  The whole point about lowering a flag that is only flown when the monarch is in residence, a tradition followed for four hundred years, still bothers me.  The flag was not lowered to half-mast for Queen Victoria or Winston Churchill, so the idea that it should be lowered for anybody still strikes me as being wrong.  Still, \\"The Queen\\" makes it clear that if there had been more from the monarch early on, there would have been less required as a public \\"mea culpa\\" later.<br /><br />For me the villain of the piece is Blair's wife, Cherie (Helen McCrory), who grins idiotically when performing a \\"shallow\\" curtsey in the presence of the Queen and takes glee in what is happening to the monarchy.  It takes most of the film, but eventually it is Blair himself who has to articulate why the woman sitting on the throne deserves respect if not loyalty.  I doubt that most Americans even know of the young Elizabeth Windsor who was an auto mechanic during World War II, when she and her mother and sister stayed in London during the Blitz, while thousands of other young children were being sent out of town (as see in the opening of \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\").  Those of us who know of how Fate intervened to put this woman on the throne can only look at Cherie Blair and observe that Elizabeth did more for her country as a teenager than the prime minister's wife has done in her entire life.<br /><br />It is interesting to see how the funeral itself is reduced to almost an epilogue, although there is still a key scene to come afterwards.  Although itseem to be on point the moment where Elizabeth and the royal family stood at the gate of Buckingham palace and bowed their heads is omitted, as are such memorable moments as Elton John singing a new version of \\"Candle in the Wind\\" or the card to \\"Mummy\\" that Harry put on his mother's coffin.  For this film all that matters is that the Queen sits in Westminster and listens to Diana's brother laud his dead sister, extolling her as true royalty, because even once she gets her wake up call, the Queen has to have her nosed rubbed in it one more time.  Mirren's Elizabeth might be wrong in her reaction to the death of Diana, but once again the fault lies with Fate and not with the heart of a queen who has served her subjects the way she was taught long ago and once upon a time when she had been the princess of her people.<br /><br />Mirren must be looking forward to Oscar night when she will only have to give one acceptance speech rather than two, since at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards she won not only the top actress award for a movie for \\"The Queen\\" but also for her performance in \\"Elizabeth I\\" on television.  I have no doubt that each performance enhances the other in the minds of voters since the two Elizabeths certainly evince the range of Mirren's acting abilities (and both have her delivering speeches actually given by each monarch, which appeals to me as a rhetorician).  Mirren's acceptance speeches to date have been exemplary in being short and to the point, suggesting that some of the gravitas of her character may well have rubbed off on her.where Elizabeth and the royal family stood at the gate of Buckingham palace and bowed their heads is omitted, as are such memorable moments as Elton John singing a new version of \\"Candle in the Wind\\" or the card to \\"Mummy\\" that Harry put on his mother's coffin.

B000E97HIA|4.0|While many critics claim that this album is Prince's best since Sign O' the Times, it's not.  Not even close.  While a slight improvement over his last effort, 2004's Musicology, this album cannot compare with the artist's earlier material.  This is not saying that it is not a great album, but Prince set the bar so high twenty years ago that his music can only be compared to his previous efforts.  While this doesn't have the originality of Sign O'The Times or Purple Rain, it is still a very strong album with some of his funkiest music of late. <br /> <br />\\"Black Sweat\\" is the best Prince single since \\"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.\\"  Too bad that it didn't generate the airplay that it deserved.  It has a minimilistic funk bass similiar to \\"Kiss,\\" and the lyrics are dripping with sex.  While Prince may be a reformed Jehova's Witness, he still heats up your stereo better than anyone out there.   <br /> <br />\\"Te Amo Corazon\\" comes across as a bland attempt at a ballad upon first listen, but this song sticks with you and grows with each listen.  \\"Fury\\" has some of Prince's greatest guitar work this decade, but unfortunately the lyrics are a little bland and cliched.   <br /> <br />The overproduction of much of Prince's material of late plagues this album and keeps it from being truly great.  The instruments and effects on some of these songs are definately overkill, there is not a moment of silence on this album.  With all of it's flaws, it is still better than 99% of the albums released in 2006, and Prince is still THE ARTIST.

B000J10ERO|2.0|There is a reason that the 1978 version of Superman is a classic.  It stands against the test of time.  Christopher Reeve definitely made you think that he could fly.  Subtle body movements were more than enough to make you feel Superman in flight.  He also captured both Clark Kent and Superman, giving each of them defining characteristics that made you like and care about them, even though they were, technically, the same person.  Back in 1983, they tried to re-make Casablanca.  It isn't hard to understand why it failed.  When a movie is deemed a classic, it's virtually impossible to make it again.  Like a work of art, it can't be duplicated.<br /><br />And that was the first and biggest mistake of the writers and filmmakers on Superman Returns.  They simply should have made a Superman of their own rather than try to copy and extend the storyline from the original films made over 20 years ago.  Christopher Nolan understood this when he decided to finally make a good Batman film (Batman Begins).<br /><br />The writers probably thought they were paying tribute to the 1978 classic when they borrowed similar plot lines and even used the same dialogue in several places in this film.  You'll recognize many lines and parallel plots to easily make the connections between the '78 version and this film.<br /><br />In the 1978 version, Lex tries to sink part of California to increase the value of the desert land he bought.  In this version, he attempts to create his own land, using stolen Kryptonite technology and wiping out the eastern half of the United States.  You can't help but say, \\"haven't we already seen something like this before?\\"<br /><br />To be fair to Brandon Routh, you simply can't fill the shoes of Christopher Reeve.  However, Routh makes Superman much too wooden.  He doesn't give much indication of anything.  He lacks the charisma that's needed to play both Superman and Clark Kent.  His facial expressions are nearly void of emotion or feeling.  Christopher Reeve was a Juliard trained actor.  He literally immersed himself in his roles, including Superman.  Routh also doesn't disguise his voice as Clark Kent.  And no one can make the connection?!?  Reeve gave Kent the charm of a bumbling Cary Grant reminicent of the Grant's film \\"Bringing Up Baby.\\"  Supposedly, Superman Returns is a continuation from the original Superman films.  If so, why does Clark Kent no longer disguise his voice?  Also, you just don't get the sensation that he's flying.  Part of the problem with this is that there aren't enough close-up scenes of him when he's flying.  The writers and director also never devoted enough time to the characters of Clark and Superman to where we feel a connection with them.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is simply awful as Lois Lane.  In fact, I don't think anyone has portrayed her worse.  Bosworth seems almost lost in how to portray the \\"tough\\" reporter of Lois Lane.  Even Margot Kidder furnished Lois with a \\"go get'em\\" attitude.  Bosworth plays Lois like a wallflower.  Plus, there is no chemistry between Routh and Bosworth which is the pinnacle of this story!  The love connection has always been about Superman and Lois Lane.  Again, they attempted to copy the romantic Superman/Lois flight as Superman takes Lois for quick ride into the night.  It doesn't work.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey has his moments as Lex Luthor when he's almost good as Lex Luthor.  He attempted to stick with Gene Hackman's performance.  The scene with him beating on Superman when he's being affected by kryptonite is good.  Lex is supposed to have a savage side to him.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT BELOW!<br /><br />The back story is also not convincing enough.  Superman travels back to Krypton to find out if it is, in fact, destroyed?!?  After Jor-el tells him during his training that Krypton is gone, it's hard to believe that he would need confirmation, even if astronomers claimed to have seen it.  If Superman remembered Einstein, as Jor-el taught him about Einstein's theories of relativity in the '78 version, Superman would have realized that light from \\"Krypton\\" would only now be seen from Earth, and therefore, Krypton is not really there anymore.<br /><br />Also, the part with Superman having a son just doesn't fit at all.  When and where was this to have supposedly happen?  Again, if this is supposed to be a continuation of the original Superman films, the only time \\"Superman\\" slept with Lois Lane was in Superman II, and even then he was mortal.  Plus, the timing doesn't figure into it.  The writers tried to sell this \\"bit\\" but instead of trying to make it somewhat credible, it ends up being ludicrous.<br /><br />The kryptonite is also handled poorly.  Superman's powers are literally drained from him, making him even weaker than a normal person.  If you recall in the 1978 version, he couldn't even take the chain off from around his neck when Lex put the kryptonite on him.  And suddenly, in this film, with a fragment of kryptonite stuck in him, he's able to lift a land mass the size of a small country out of the ocean and into space?!?  It isn't likely or believeable, nor are we given a plausible explanation about how he could do this. Even in \\"Smallville\\" when Clark is exposed to kryptonite, he can barely move.<br /><br />Many of these problems could have been fixed simply by making a new and different Superman, rather than continuing where the previous films left off.  It would have been that simple.  I mean, they did manage to give Superman a totally different costume (the worst Superman costume ever designed).<br /><br />The special effects were first-rate, but this day and age, special effects aren't enough anymore.  We want a good story with good, believeable characters, and this film simply doesn't have either one.rman would have realized that light from \\"Krypton\\" would only now be seen from Earth, and therefore, Krypton is not really there anymore.

0345440900|5.0|(Written by my wife before she got her own Amazon account.)    I love Tracy Hogg! All of her books are awesome helps! Her advice is packaged common sense. She has helped me be an aware parent, so even if I go against her recommendations (which I have often done because nothing is set into stone), I am aware of the possible consequences.     To be honest, I had to read it four times to really get all the information I needed. However, by then, her techniques were so ingrained that I could then help other moms with their babies.     Tracy does not say that all babies fit into one of the five types; she says that many are more than one type.     She doesn't just give lists of things to do. She gives examples and tells stories, and it's up to you to figure out how that applies to your baby.    As with any advice, you must take into account your baby. AND, don't feel guilty if you decide to do things a different way. Her basic techniques are awesome tools to branch out from.    BENEFITS  *I taught my baby how to go to bed at 7pm, instead of when she wanted to-- at 10 or later!  *My baby has known how to put herself to sleep since she was 2 months old! No rocking or walking around with her!  *Once I started the routine, my baby slept 6+ hours at night. And I've been getting a full 8 hours of sleep for months!    If you invest yourself in her techniques, you will see the benefits. And trust me, your baby will be the envy of the neighborhood. This is the case in my experience, and my sister-in-law's. You just have to read it more than once. But really, that will save you time in the end!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Edward Norton heads up a wonderful cast which includes Rufus Sewell, Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel in \\"The Illusionist.\\"  It's a wonderful story of just how far a man will go to get back to the love of his life.  Norton portrays Eisenheim, an illusionist who has a penchant for bizarre, almost supernatural magic tricks that captivate his audience.  As a teen, he falls for a young duchess (Biel).  However, he being the poor son of commoners and she being royalty, their love is forbidden and the two are separated for what seems like forever.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we learn that Eisenheim has found his lovely duchess, but she is to wed Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell), a hateful, cocky man who is intent on scientifically and logically explaining all of Norton's magical acts.  Naturally, the Eisenheim and Duchess Sophie begin to meet secretly, only to have Leopold dispatch Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) and his goons to find out what's really happening.  From there, the story begins to twist and turn.  It's full of deceit, rage, romance, and even a little bit of humor.  I can't speak much more about it or I'll give away too much.<br /><br />Norton is superb.  His lovelorn character becomes progressively sicker as the story unfolds, and he exerts all of his energy to reclaim the love of his life.  Biel does a wonderful job even though her accent isn't the most believable.  She carries off the role of royalty very well.  Giamatti is perfect as Uhl, who not only investigates the matter at hand, but narrates the story as well.  You don't know if you should root for him or pray that he gets his just desserts.  Sewell delivers, in my opinion, the top performance in this story.  He's arrogant, vengeful, and a baldfaced liar to boot.  His actions keep this story moving along at an acceptable pace.<br /><br />Overall, this film is well deserving of four-and-one-half stars.  It's a great flick that combines forbidden love, deceit, violence, and a little bit of magic all into one.  It's a definite keeper, and I give it my \\"must buy\\" seal of approval.all into one.

B00003CXUM|5.0|<br /> <br />The story is set in the early 60s. <br />The landscape, the music, the scenery are perfectly set to remind us of those years when things were changing and new values were created. <br />During those years, the freedom in relations was also accompanied by the respect to the values of the generation before. <br />In this environment of challenging changes, two couples move in an apartment block in Hong Kong. <br /> <br />The spouses of both couples are very successful in their own business and careers and often travel overseas. <br />Soon it is understood that the \\"often-travelling\\" spouses have an affair. <br />The remaining two, who are busy with their daily life in Hong Kong while their spouses are travelling, find comfort in their growing friendship. <br />One can imagine that the fact that their spouses have an affair might have tempt them to act in a way to either confront them or to have an affair themselves. <br />And yet, the obvious appears to escape realisation. <br /> <br />Despite the attraction between them, despite their wonderful friendship and their bitterness over the way their spouses behaved, they keep their dignity and respect above all. <br />They share so much and they enjoy moments of silence, loving conversation, eating together, visiting the street vendor for noodles, and sharing an umbrella in the tropical rain, and all this \\"in the mood for love\\" <br />This mood for love is constantly in the air and it is expressed in more that one way. <br />The conversations, the cinematography, the impressive music, are all elements, which are reinforcing this \\"mood\\" that remains in the air until the very last second of this magnificent film. <br />Sad and loving, emotional and strong, soft and sensual, this film is moving slowly at its own pace and keeps the viewer attached to the story from the very first second to the very last. <br />At the end, there is a \\"biter-sad-love\\" feeing in the mind of the viewer who is by now part of the story. <br />A classic than you must not miss. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002H6C|5.0|When I grew up, I was pretty ignorant musically. I thought \\"Hysteria\\" by Def Leppard was as hardcore as it got. I just never ventured out and tried anything new musically. Then one day, a friend said \\"if you like Def Leppard, you gotta listen to this.\\" And then he played ONE. That was the beginning. Within a month, I owned all Metallica's albums, and since then I have branched out to Pantera, Ozzy, Slayer, Hatebreed, Six Feet Under, Megadeth, Sepultura, and others. I had so much catching up to do.. it kept my head banging all through the alternative craze of the 90's, so thankfully I was headbanging to Metallica and Slayer instead of listening to Nirvana and Blind Melon whine and moan. Now that rap has taken over, I am always on the lookout for new heavy metal, and it all started with Metallica and the Justice album. Metallica's first 5 studio albums are truly great, and they did it all through sheer musical talent, not relying on a stream of profanity or music videos full of strippers. Load, Re-Load and St. Anger sucked, but maybe Rick Rubin can get them back on track.
B000JLTRKE|4.0|As I watched this film, I found myself drifting in mind to that morning 5 1/2 years ago.  The time, the place, the emotions, the stunned reactions of those around me, the devastation, they all returned.  The most stunning aspect of this film is hearing the major-news commentary from TVs on in the backrounds.  Jennings, Rather, Brokaw...all commenting in shock, horror and anger. <br /> <br />Where did it go?  Why has America sold it's soul to the liberals, forgetting the savagery of that day?  Every high-school should show this movie in history class, so that our children can rightly learn that their parents are stuck on stupid.
B00000FCBC|5.0|This was released in the middle of the Load-ReLoad period, and it proved to me that Metallica can still be great if they want to. It may be all covers, but it still rocks. At least they are still capable of remembering what \\"heavy metal\\" is, and where they came from. Of course, they followed this up with S&M which pretty much sucked (except \\"Puppets\\" sounds really good on that album) then St. Anger, which was the bottom. If Rick Rubin can re-awaken the metal monster in the band, then we may be in for more original music like this.
B000006054|4.0|><br /><br />As a teenager I wanted to run down the middle of my hometown steet screaming and<br />throwing myself in the air, anything to break up the dull drab everydayness of it, I don't know if this is a common fantasy that teenagers have?<br /><br />A friend of mine said that Shakespeare is hard to read but easier to understand when seen performed on stage.  I've read Howl (or got 2/3 of the way through it) a couple of times without really understanding it or enjoying it.<br /><br />I've heard it recited on stage a couple of times by Jean & John Waggoner's City Lights Review, and even saw/heard Allen Ginsberg himself perform it at Cheltenham Literary Festival circa about 1992.  And while appreciating the passion of these live readings and recognising a few references: \\"Neal Cassady cocksman...\\" etc. I didn't really get it.  I knew that two very intelligent friends of mine got a big buzz out of it, so knew I must be missing something.<br /><br />So when I got Allen Ginsberg 'Howl & Other Poems' CD and seeing that Howl was<br />the first track on it, I put it on my player, lay on the bed, closed my eyes, settled down and listened.  Through Allen's distinctive matter-of-fact voice the poem unfolded, revealing itself to me.  It was the same story as Jack Kerouac's On the Road (correct me if I'm wrong) containing nearly all the same characters and a few others, yet told in impressionistic verse, instead of Jack's long prose poem.  A take on the same era/scene/ emotion but from a different angle.<br /><br />It's the paean of the underdog, concentrate: wonderful imagery. Let Allen lead you around the scene and show you that time, incident by pictured incident.  As he reads it see it on the inside of your eyelids.  You're back there with him.  He describes Neal Cassady and his love-making escapades perfectly, sums up the life events of many 1940's beatniks to be repeated by the same crashes and compromises of 1960's hippies.  Lives and dreams crushed by the materialistic grey morning commonsense it's-always been-this-way boulder of inevitability, learning ways to grease their bodies so they slide around the boulder and feel less its weight.<br /><br />If you've read On the Road three times and would like to take the trip again in a different seat in the car, try Allen's.  Although is it my impression that Allen's view while exhilarating is a lot bleaker than Jacks?
B00002Z88D|3.0|The orchestra was completely out of place in this album; they are just not capable of truly fitting in with heavy metal. Nothing against orchestra; I played in one in high school. (Hey, it was an easy A!) but it's oil and water.. orchestras and heavy metal just don't mix. There were a few good songs on here; I must say Master of Puppets on this album sounds really good. If I had to buy it again, I wouldn't pay for the whole album, I'd pick and choose the better songs on itunes.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Because I only have 'Drowned World Tour' on DVD and nothing else (concert-wise), I wanted to have `TCT' to see for myself, what it was all about. My best friend attended the Montreal show and loved it. I never attended a Madonna concert and am very happy to own this item. Won't go into great detail regarding what should've been on it and what not. What I will say is that Madonna looks and sounds just as good as she did back in the beginning. She moves far better than anyone half her age, and her voice is fresh and vibrant as ever. I always admired Madonna for her \\"bad girl\\" image, but have a whole new appreciation for her since buying the \\"I'm Going to tell you a secret\\" and `TCT' CD & DVDs. Only negative comment I have is this: Perhaps yes, the CD should've had more material on it? Perhaps an unreleased bonus track or two?<br /><br />Madonna's personality on and offstage is remarkable and her costumes this time around are fab and the dancers and choreography are incredible. This truly is a 'Show' and not a concert. I did want to mention something: The voice in the intro of \\"Sorry\\" does sound a lot like Neil Tennant from `Pet Shop Boys', yet he's not credited anywhere in the booklet. As for the DTS 5.1 sound, I don't care, as long as I can see/hear the show, since I watch all my concert DVDs from my computer anyway. Picture/Sound quality is great. Having the DVD is all that should really matter, no? At least we got something at all, considering there wasn't an official release of `Reinvention Tour' on DVD.<br /><br />Let me talk about the packaging. DVD and CD are housed inside a matte double digipack with attached booklet. The booklet (19 pages) feature lots of footage from the show, song & concert production credits and other stuff. Inner right flap features silhouette of a horse on a creamy pinkish-white background. Meanwhile, the DVD is black with the silhouette of a running horse in white. The CD features Madonna's white silhouette on a black background. The backside of the digipack features DVD tracks first, then CD tracks, bonus material and information pertaining to the product & formatting.<br /><br />Other Info:<br />- Picture Format: 16X9<br />- Multiple Viewing Angles: 1<br />- Color Mode: Color<br />- Region Code: 1<br />- Disc Format: DVD-9<br />- Duration: 121 Min, Plus Bonus Material<br />- Language And Audio Content: English, PCM Stereo & DTS 5.1<br />- Subtitles: None<br /><br />DVD Tracklisting:<br />01- Future Lovers / I Feel Love<br />02- Get Together<br />03- Like a Virgin<br />04- Jump<br />05- Confessions<br />06- Live To Tell<br />07- Forbidden Love<br />08- Isaac<br />09- Sorry<br />10- Like it or Not<br />11- Sorry (Remix)<br />12- I Love New York<br />13- Ray of Light<br />14- Let it Will Be<br />15- Drowned World / Substitute For Love<br />16- Paradise (Not For Me)<br />17- Music Inferno<br />18- Erotica<br />19- La Isla Bonita<br />20- Lucky Star<br />21- Hung Up<br />Plus Bonus Behind-The-Scenes Footage and Photo Gallery<br /><br />CD Tracklisting:<br />01- Future Lovers / I Feel Love<br />02- Like a Virgin<br />03- Jump<br />04- Confessions<br />05- Isaac<br />06- Sorry<br />07- Sorry (Remix)<br />08- I Love New York<br />09- Let It Will Be<br />10- Music Inferno<br />11- Erotica<br />12- Lucky Star<br />13- Hung Upgipack features DVD tracks first, then CD tracks, bonus material and information pertaining to the product & formatting.

0618680004|5.0|In \\"The God Delusion\\", Dawkins presents a forceful argument against irrational beliefs.  His argument necessarily focuses on the most prominent religions in western culture and the progenitor of those religions, a belief in a supernatural god.  This focus makes sense because within those religions irrational beliefs are not only accepted, they are required. <br /> <br />It is shocking that in the 21st century there are still people who believe that a few thousand years ago a man named Noah built a boat and packed it with two of every living creature on the planet.  Even more people believe that 2000 years ago god impregnated a young virgin who gave birth to a divine savior named Jesus who is your only path to heaven.  Many of these same people still believe that Saddam Hussein posed a significant threat to the United States. <br />  <br />Dawkins' book does a pretty good job explaining why irrational beliefs such as these are dangerous.  And he does it with a literary style that is both polished and surprisingly fun to read.  It is not without its flaws, but his critics almost always get it wrong.  Reading through the negative reviews here, I see the following recurring themes. <br /> <br />1.  He ignores the positive contributions of religion like the promotion of charity and good will.  This is exactly like saying that critics of smoking are ignoring its positive effects like enhanced concentration and reduced risk of Parkinson's disease.  While is true that religion can be used to promote charity and good will, there are other ways to promote these qualities that don't carry the harmful side effects of religion. <br /> <br />2.  He ignores the harm done by science like the creation of nuclear arms.  This argument confuses science, the method by which we arrive at accurate information (e.g. E=MC**2), with the use of the information revealed by science.  Arguments against science are simply arguments for ignorance; nothing more, nothing less. <br /> <br />3.  He isunreasonably harsh in his treatment of religion, attacking even moderate believers, and this will only push them further away from his cause.  This is probably true.  However, it is also true that even moderate practitioners accept some truly preposterous beliefs, and many will recognize themselves in this book and be swayed by the force of his argument.  For those offended by Dawkins, there are other books that provide a gentler introduction to reality. <br /> <br />4.  He doesn't adequately address the epistemological concerns of my favorite philosopher; therefore my religious beliefs are perfectly valid.  I would encourage these individuals to continue devoting their lives to arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.  Meanwhile, the rest of us can go about living in the real world where science has enabled mankind to accurately plumb the depths of matter and explore the furthest reaches of our universe. <br />

Oliver Stone directed a movie so powerful that many still believe it is the true version of the Kennedy assassination.<br /><br />The Queen is cut from the same cloth.<br /><br />This movie really focuses on the week following Diana's death, from the perspectives of two families:  the Royal Family, and newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair's family.  The movie is not complementary regarding the Royals (particularly Prince Philip), and is very complementary of Blair.<br /><br />After watching The Queen, you will find yourself wondering how much is true, and how much is fiction?<br /><br />For this, wait for Tony Blair's autobiography.  Don't wait up for the Royal family's book... that would be too undignified.

B000KCHZK6|3.0|One interesting thing about Amazon reviews is that readers really don't like negative ones; just look at the feedback votes for the pans on this page.

You couldn't escape Come Away With Me the summer it was out; it seemed like every time I went to someone's house, they simply HAD to play me this new, great record that it was impossible not to like.<br /><br />And that's the thing about Not Too Late.  It is not impossible to dislike this record.  Come Away From Me was lightning in a bottle; it sold 18 million copies yet it was a small record.  It was that rarest of albums--a hit on merit, not record company push (heck, it was on Blue Note).  It oozed simple earnest charm.<br /><br />But you can't make your first record more than once, and you probably can't make another universally acclaimed 18-million seller either. Not Too Late is a more challenging work. Of course it boasts the natural gifts of Jones and crew (notably boyfriend/collaborator Lee Alexander.)  But it is a genre-hopping, at times almost experimental work, nowhere as consistent, uniform, or in the pocket as her earlier records.  If you have expectations based on previous records (not unreasonable), then this will almost undoubtedly not live up to them.<br /><br />But that means she is painting with a broader palate, and sometimes that takes getting used to; it is indeed possible that with a few years time, Not Too Late will look like Norah's creative breakthrough, maybe something like Elvis Costello's Imperial Bedroom. When I first heard Come Away With Me, my immediate reaction was to go and listen to my Rickie Lee Jones records again, because I thought that, as likable as it was, it was derivative.  But what you hear on Not Too Late is an artist finding her own voice.<br /><br />If you are a fan, then of course you ought to pick this up (and in my opinion, the price is right.)  If you are just coming to Norah's work, then (a) where have you been; and (b) you really should start with Come Away With me.  There are moments of sublime beauty here (\\"Not My Friend\\"), and I have a feeling this album will sound very different after I've let it \\"breathe\\" a few months.  It does not scale the heights of her first two main records on the \\"I Instantly Love This and So Will You\\"-o-meter.  Where it falls out in time, we'll just have to wait and see.  But I do think that whatever she does from here, this record points the way.ause I thought that, as likable as it was, it was derivative.

This cd takes me back to my sophmore  year, there was a lot going on then. It's a great cd that describes love and feelings.If you don't have this cd,BUY IT!<br /><br />I wish I could give this cd more stars!It's rare that I like the whole cd,besides track#5.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|I simply will say that I like this movie.  It was very well done.  The characters are complex and they definitely have issues.  But take the movie for what it's worth and enjoy it!  It's an action/thriller flick that keeps your attention!!  Five stars!!
B00005JOCU|5.0|I had a feeling that I'd like this movie - I just didn't know how much.  It's really great and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I have known of the musical for years, but living in Australia, it's never come here and I've never seen that.  But whether you look at it as a movie version of the play or just as a stand alone movie, it's brilliant either way. <br />The music is amazing.  All the singing is great.  The costumes and make-up and hair are great and the acting is superb.  Beyonce does a good job, and while Eddie Murphy is great, I almost thought Jamie Foxx was better.  Danny Glover is fantastic, Anika Noni Rose shines but the true brilliant acting does come from Jennifer Hudson.  She deserves the Oscar for sure.  Look out for good cameos like Jaleel White (Urkel) and Loretta Devine.  Sharon Leal (Boston Public) stars as the 'third' member after Effie leaves. <br />The resemblences in the movie to real life are there - there is a group in some scenes who are just like the Jackson 5, and some of the looks that Beyonce had are so similar to Diana Ross. <br />I cannot recommend this movie highly enough - especially if you love the sounds of Motown and further into disco also.  I cannot wait for this to come to DVD.  I just hope they don't run short on copies because everyone will want to snatch this up as soon as it's released too.  Do yourself a favour and catch this brilliant movie especially while it still might be on on the big screen.  I love it.
B00005J6T1|5.0|I can't add to what everyone else has said.  It's remastered, has extra cuts on it and it sounds just great.  Five stars!
B0000029AL|5.0|So what if the recording sounds lousy. This is the rawest most crudest and best rock & roll Aerosmith has ever done. Energy and songs is the priority over quality. I love the sound of Perry's old amp(probably a 50's Fender champ?) sound like the tubes are dying at the beginning of Somebody and they left it in for posterity! Perfect.
B00005J6T0|5.0|Remastered, it sounds even better.  La Isla Bonita is my favorite song.  Five stars for Ms. Madonna...
0307346609|3.0|I really got into the audio version of this book. Listening to the production of World War Z is the way to go here. You can probably get it through your local library. The reason I say this is that this story is comprised of about 20 small first person narratives strung together to make one larger story. In the audio version, actors from Alan Alda to Turturro read chapters and really give the story a nice feel.<br /><br />I love zombies. Romero and his living dead flicks are some of my favorites. However, I feel that the story that gets told whether it is another director making a movie like '28 days' or another writer like Stephen King and his 'Cell', the stories are all pretty much the same. 'World War Z' is no different, only it is a very positive and feel good zombie story without much in the way of suspense. You jump from one character to another, so you are never really brought into a fight for survival on a raw level, you just focus on the greatest hit moments. I have long wondered if it were possible to better the 'living dead' formula when it comes to zombies, after all Romero updated the classic zombie idea of the 1930's and made it what it is today. But what else can a writer add to 'Night of the Living Dead?' Max Brooks surely didn't add anything, he just made it politically correct and ready for Hallmark greeting cards.<br /><br />The writing of Max Brooks is good enough, I guess I cant really judge it because I listened to it and the story was abridged slightly for the audio version I think. If you listen to this, you will be in for an enjoyable several hours of narrative, but beyond that, you wont find too much to whet the appetite.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace (Widescreen Edition)~ Liam Neeson is not as bad as many people have said. Yes it is very different from the original movies. Liam Neeson is amazing in his role. Jar Jar Binks is a hoot and quite funny. The special effects are out of this world good and some of the best in business. The script is well written and plot is well developed.  I love this series and Lukas has totally created a master piece and one the best sci-fi series of all time. I definitely give it 5 stars out of 5. Highly recommended.
0316172324|2.0|Malcolm Gladwell has pulled together a series of nicely-told anecdotes about .... something. He doesn't put much effort into trying to explain what is going on, whether in fact anything interesting actually is going on, nor does he make a convincing case that the various examples he uses actually have anything in common. I couldn't see much connection among museum curators being able to recognize fake sculptures, psychologists predicting the strength of a couple's relationship based on watching a conversation, and a former Special Forces soldier using unconventional guerilla tactics to outwit the military establishment. Gladwell's journalistic background comes through in his easy writing style and lack of intellectual rigor. It's easy to read and easy to forget.

0066214122|2.0|Prey is to a novel what the \\"wild swarm\\" Ricky was to the real Ricky: It presents a suggestion of a real book, but lacks the features, the characteristics of the real thing ... and it disperses on the ground at the slightest breeze.  <br /> <br />Like the worst of the bodice-ripper genre, Prey's hero, Jack, makes the stupidest decisions - or makes no decision at all - when presented with behaviors that would alarm anyone else ... all to make the plot move forward where Crichton wants it to go.  <br /> <br />And when the communication lines were ripped out by the nano-Ricky and nano-Julia, I kept wondering whatever happened to Jack's cell phone? You know, the one he'd just used the day before to talk to his kids, and that worked just fine out in the desert?  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I kept reading to the end because Crichton's discussion about programming based on the natural world was fascinating. For that it gets a 2 rather than a 1.   <br /> <br />
B00005J6SZ|5.0|I agree with everyone who likes this remastered disc.  For me, \\"Material Girl\\" and \\"Like a Virgin\\" showed the new direction of Pop Music in the 80's with Madonna leading the way!  Five stars!
B00026W82U|4.0|I bought this album after I heard \\"I'd Rather Dance with You\\" on a college radio station while I was cruising the coast of Delaware.  It had a simple, very catchy formula, and I naturally prefer music with a folky feel these days.  If simplicity is what you are looking for in an album, this is right up your alley.  From the lyrics, to the music, to the harmonies themselves, sometimes you don't have to have all the \\"bells and whistles\\" to get an album right.  It is clean, fresh, and pleasant to the ear.  It's also pretty versatile.  It's understated enough to not distract you as a background music, but catchy enough to keep your attention in regular rotation.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good album, but if you want some folkish rock with a little \\"swagger,\\" I'd suggest Iron and Wine.
B000002O1Q|3.0|The cd is ok.  Not much to say about it.  They're the songs from the movie.  The cd arrived in great shape and was brand new.

0307346609|5.0|All you have to say is that I couldn't put this book down.  Brooks often makes references to pop sci-fi culture that made me laugh several times during the book.  I would recommend this book for anyone who wants a great, fun read.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Being a Marvel Comics' fan, I really do like their representation of \\"Daredevil.\\"  Ben Affleck does a good job in his role, as does Ms. Wagner as Elecktra.  The action scenes were entertaining.  I rate the movie five stars!
B000J103PC|3.0|The old saying, \\"clothes make the man\\", apparently applies equally to women. (Perhaps it applies more strictly to women, but was never spoken for a lack of need.) <br /> <br />My point being that when Andrea (Anne Hathaway) slips out of her frumpy plaid skirts and bargain bin sweaters and trades up to Jimmy Choo shoes, she becomes a remarkably efficient assistant to Miranda, the devil-in-Prada. No longer does she clumsily fumble her way down Manhattan streets with Starbucks coffees, bags of last-minute requests - no, now she has her hair done, is \\"decked out to the nines\\" (pun intended) and is one competent gal. <br /> <br />Sorry, but that seemed a bit too Barbie-esque for me. One minute we have Barbie the flight attendant, for example, the next Barbie the CEO. All because of the clothes. <br /> <br />Meryl Streep plays her character with gorgeous understatement - you can almost hear the soft hissing in her voice when she speaks. Anne Hathaway plays an interesting \\"Ugly Betty\\" character (for indeed, Ugly Betty seems to have used this for much of its inspiration, at least at Mode Magazine). Anne is hardly unattractive, hardly fat - she simply isn't representative of haute couture. <br /> <br />There isn't much of a plot to the movie. It's more of a collection of events taking Andrea from a bungling assistant to a more successful assistant, and everything that you would expect coming along for the ride - a jealous boyfriend, a love interest that seems to appear in the story for one reason alone...that sort of thing. <br /> <br />Yet it's an entertaining film. Streep is a delight to watch, as is Hathaway, especially in the beginning when she was growing accustomed to her co-workers looking askance at her. All-in-all, it was enjoyable and funny - if not great.
B0001Z52RU|2.0|Boasting a similar plot to \\"Bedazzled\\", in which Dudley Moore, granted seven wishes by the devil, finds himself tied in ever more fiendish knots as he tries to get closer to the girl of his dreams. He is finally trapped as a nun blowing a perenial rasberry in his own private hell. You may find yourself wanting to blow a similar rasberry in the direction of \\"Butterfly Effect\\", a far less entertaining film.    Likewise, it is about the hopeless pursuit of a paramour, only the title is a misnomer, being nothing to do with chaos theory. Instead, it is, like \\"Bedazzled\\", decidedly non-secular and old-testament in its morality. It is just beyond the balance of probabilities that every outcome would be negative. Thus the cards are stacked in favour of a reactionary message of not defying God's will, rather than the capriciousness of nature, in which they would not. The Christian theme of sacrificing oneself for others in an act of faith and love might be aimed squarely at the bible belt, had it not been for the perverse solution of an abortion which would more likely have fundamentalists frothing at the mouth. Definately one for the \\"what were they thinking of?\\" filing cabinet.
B000I5X81K|2.0|Basic filler & fluff. Sales $$$$ <br />Boring, uninspiring and tame. Nothing memorable. <br />Only his voice saves an otherwise dissapointing production. <br />As a real fan of his, it was almost painful to listen to. <br /> <br />
B000LC3ID8|5.0|With Jigsaw debilitated and near death, it falls to his new protege to carry on the infamous 'games' in \\"Saw III\\", the most recent entry in one of the 2000s's best ongoing series.  Knowing nothing of any apprentice, the detectives who've been pursuing the Jigsaw killer since the first chapter in the series are mystified by the continuing killings. <br /> <br />   \\"Saw III\\" ties elements from its two predecessors in with new ideas and a new direction expertly, creating a movie that enhances both of the films that came before it (which were already excellent).  The ongoing story has become deeper and more multi-faceted while losing nothing of the horror and tension that initially catapulted the concept to greatness.  The new protege abducts a doctor whose own life now depends on her ability to keep Jigsaw alive long enough to see the outcome of the latest, most complex - and most psychologically interesting - of the deathtrap-oriented games.  The character of Jigsaw is explored more deeply in this one - for the first time it feels like his rationale of 'teaching the value of being alive' by bringing the victims who survive so close to death, may actually be something more than a contrived excuse for a psychopath to reign in terror and pain.  For the first time the character, despite the depravity of his actions throughout the series, comes off as being possibly something other than nothing but plain evil, comes off as a twisted but mentally complex individual who may somehow believe his own words, and that his games - in his own warped psyche - have more to them than gratuitous sadism.  He even appears capable of sympathizing with his victims.  This is not a plot roundabout to just take a villain who became immensely popular and 'turn him good', it's part of an an ongoing evolution of what's being revealed about the characters (as of this entry there are now a fair number who have appeared in two or more of the movies).  The characterization of Jigsaw's apprenticeis also very developed here, but harder to reference directly without risking spoilers; and the doctor - who despite her dangerous situation seems consumed more by a desire to save her patient regardless of who or what he is - is an excellent addition to the roster of players.  And as for the infamous games themselves, nothing of the shock, nothing of the savagery, nothing of the intensity has been sacrificed to make room for expanded insight into the characters.  Indeed, the twists and revelations - and questions - spinning out of this latest round of the games may be the most gripping of the trilogy. <br /> <br />\\"Saw III\\" just might be the best of the saga to date; one of 2006's most indispensable horror movies.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|A fun movie, good special effects.  One of the more interesting \\"Kung Fu Comedies\\" that I've seen in the last several years.  The Kung Fu action was from outer space!

B000KQGP2G|5.0|So, I finally got ahold of my copy of this album, and I've been listening to it nonstop.  Take my praise for what it's worth (which is perhaps nothing, considering I love this band so much), but this was definitely worth the wait.  To be honest, I'm still kind of getting over the shock that \\"Scarsick\\" turned out to be \\"The Perfect Element 2\\" in disguise.  I was really just expecting this to be a decent album to tide us over until the ultimate masterpiece was released on some magical day in the far distant future.  So, when suddenly it's just here before I knew it, I was just completely thrown.<br /><br />So, what do we have here?  While I was pretty much expecting TPE2 to just level everything in music as we know it, I have to say that this isn't nearly THAT good, but then that just goes to show that expectations can be a bad thing.  I don't think this album is ever going to quite rank up there with TPE1 or \\"Remedy Lane\\" (for all I know, that may be impossible), but it doesn't matter, because this album is still freaking great.<br /><br />Lyrically, and musically, this album is ANGRY.  It's dark, it's aggressive, it's caustic, it's vitriolic.  Lyrics unabashedly rage against greed, materialism, conformity, hypocrisy, and of course, President Bush.  You can tell that in writing this, Daniel Gildenlow was really blowing off some steam.  I should clarify that \\"angriest album\\" doesn't necessarily mean \\"heaviest album\\", as it's more in just the overall feel and nature of the music.  You have songs like \\"Spitfall\\" and the title track, which are powerfully heavy, and superbly utilize Daniel's rap vocals, which are only getting better (\\"Spitfall\\"...I mean WOW), and then there's \\"Mrs. Modern Mother Mary\\", with an offbeat grungy riff, and \\"Flame to the Moth\\", which features some almost hardcore/metalcore-type vocals (but only a little).<br /><br />BUT, then you have stuff like \\"Disco Queen\\"!  I believe PoS have, with this song, created a brand new genre: PROGRESSIVE DISCO!!!  Ok, maybe Mr. Bungle got there first, but this song is just insane.  An 8-minute prog epic, filled with pulsating disco rhythms, melded perfectly with the myriad time changes, and Daniel's ever-dynamic vocals.  And amazingly, the lyrics don't deviate from the angriness of the concept, and yet still fit with the music.  Yep, genius.<br /><br />Elsewhere, there's plenty more greatness.  \\"America\\" is surprisingly bouncy and catchy, despite its super-scathing lyrics (how funny would it be to see this song become a hit single???), \\"Cribcaged\\" is dark and melodic, and despite its repeated use of the f-word (that's another thing, this album narrowly escaped an \\"explicit lyrics\\" label), retains great beauty.  \\"Kingdom of Loss\\" is a smooth broadway-esque ballad, and while it doesn't come near the heights of its predecessor, \\"King of Loss\\", it's stunning in its own right.  \\"Idiocracy\\" was a bit slow to grow on me, but it's got some wicked cool time changes, and nice use of mandolin (excellent outro as well).  The album ends with the HUGE \\"Enter Rain\\", which is minimally grandiose, and much like the closing track on TPE1, ends the album on a powerful note.<br /><br />This is something I'll definitely be listening to for quite some time.  Just a warning, this probably will alienate a lot of the more \\"prog-oriented\\" fans of the band, who may perhaps think disco, cursing, and rapping are evil and boorish, and send them running for the latest Shadow Gallery release.  Not to mention this album contains only ONE guitar solo! *gasp, shudder, faint, monacle dropping into wine glass* But, if you love stuff like Tool, Deftones, Nine Inch Nails, Devin Townsend, Faith No More, etc, I think you'll have no complaints.  As with any PoS album, come expecting something different, and something great.  Again, take my praise for what it's worth, I know I'm sufficiently obsessed, but I promise you this is definitely worth hearing.  I know I won't be getting sick of \\"Scarsick\\" any time soon.<br /><br />(Oh, and the \\"Thanks to George W. Bush for all the inspiration\\" line in the liner notes is just freakin' gold.)h for all the inspiration\\" line in the liner notes is just freakin' gold.)
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|I'd never listened to this concert before, and when I first watched the dvd I wasn't all that impressed, but after watching it several times I'm overwhelmed.  Once the work and attitudes of these artists begins to sink in the concert beomes quite spiritual.  \\"Wah-wah\\" has now become one on my favorite songs of all time, and this concert has made me become aware of people I didn't know like Voorman and Jesse Davis.  Overall an amazing experience. <br /> <br />I don't need no wah-wah!
B000AMWIVM|5.0|One of the best new horror sagas to launch in the last fifteen years - and maybe one of the best horror sagas of all time - begins here, as \\"Saw\\" introduces the world to Jigsaw, one of the most original and deadly serial killers in movie history. <br /> <br />   Unseen for most of the movie and known only through electronically-distorted voice recordings, or through videotapes in which a disturbing little puppet speaks for him, Jigsaw kills no one directly, instead capturing his victims in brutal death-traps where they're challenged to figure out clues and ways to escape their fate - and to be able to survive the arduous tests and obstacles in their way.  In the case of the main victims in this first chapter of the series, two men slowly come to conciousness chained to sturdy metal pipes inside a run-down lavatory, to meet with the encouraging sight of a bloodied corpse lying face-down on the floor between them.  There are small cassette players within easy reach, and these have messages on them leading the men to their first and most obvious (though certainly not the most preferable) means of possible escape - a small handsaw that's insufficient to cut the chains but may be capable of slicing through other substances. <br /> <br />   Jigsaw is ingenious and ruthless, preying on his victims's paranoias, their guilts, suspicions about one another (in cases where more than one person occupies the same trap) and fears about their loved ones on the outside.  The angle of Jigsaw preying on those who he considers flawed and unappreciative of life, in order to teach them the value of being alive, is well-known; without commenting here on how this thread develops through the further entries, I found that in this opening chapter, that scenario rang hollow.  It is certainly Jigsaw's rationale, but it seemed only to be an excuse for the character to engage in his fiendish games.  And, oddly enough, it worked out to the betterment - the killer who's found the moral justification, at least in his own mind, to rid himself of any mercies or compassion and to engage in as much sadism as suits him.  This is just one viewer's interpretation, and only of what we see in this first movie; but here it makes Jigsaw very disturbing, very scary, and frighteningly believable. <br /> <br />  As the conclusion approaches, the twists begin to turn, culminating in a bloodchillingly shocking final realization.  An excellent beginning for a series that's, so far, providing one of the year's top movies each October.  A horror must-see.

She loves books so much she makes sure she is sitting down when she reads so that she doesn't fall over and hurt herself when she becomes absorbed in the story.  She works for her father in his bookstore and has written one biography about little known siblings.  Except for one secret she knows about her family, her life is ordinary.  Then one day she gets a letter from a very famous author with a mysterious past asking her to come and stay with her and write her biography.  This famous author is Vida Winters.  Many before Margaret have attempted to write Ms. Winters' biography but failed.  Winters tells Margaret she is now ready to tell the truth about her past.<br /><br />Once Margaret enters the house Vida Winters lives in and begins the biography, a scary yet enchanting story unfolds.  This story has a girl in the mist; abandoned babies; crazy adults; loyal servants; and many, many mysteries.  The landscape for the novel is the Yorkshire countryside with it's decaying buildings and immense fog.  I found myself totally absorbed by the book.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what Setterfield brings us next by way of a novel.

B00005JOCS|5.0|Bill Condon's DREAMGIRLS is the finest kind of musical.  It may be forgotten, it may remembered, but what's important is that while watching it, the audience is transfixed, uplifted, and compelled to get up and sing.  It has great music, a great cast, and a great screenplay to tie it all together.  The moral of the story, if there is one, isn't really clear, but the plot, based on the tale of Diana Ross & The Supremes, revolves around three young women who become R&B superstars in the 1960s, and how their lives fall apart as their stardom increases.  If the film does have a problem, it's because it uses the same formula used by every other \\"motown bio drama\\" ever made: nobodys have a shot at stardom, they work for stardom, they become superstars, they fall into drugs and depression, they redeem themselves and accept the end of their careers.  Fortunately the rest of the film is grand enough that the formulativeness is hardly noticeable. <br /> <br />The three young women are portrayed by Beyonce Knowles, AMERICAN IDOL finalist Jennifer Hudson, and Anika Noni Rose; by the film's end, a fourth girl, Sharon Leal, has joined.  Jamie Foxx plays the slimy manager, and Danny Glover plays the kindhearted manager.  Keith Robinson plays Hudson's brother and the girls' songwriter, and Eddie Murphy plays the rambunctious James \\"Thunder\\" Early.  The entire cast is excellent, but standouts are Hudson, who is a surprisingly talented actor, and Murphy, who finally receives a chance to show off some dramatic acting and succeeds in doing so.  Foxx is also great as his most despicable character ever. <br /> <br />Bill Condon, who did a marvelous job with 2002's hit CHICAGO, does some great work here, utilizing numerous camera angles to create a sort of swirling, uplifting feeling.  The editing is seamless, and the production design is shiny and fresh.  It's the music that's really wonderful, though - sweet, hearty, warm, soaring, and a variety of other colorful, delectable adjectives.With audiences' recently-renewed interest in musicals, I'm surprised that an R&B musical hasn't been done earlier. <br /> <br />There's not a lot to be said about DREAMGIRLS - there's nothing especially original or bold about it.  But it's good, well-made, high-spirited fun, and if you're looking for a way to kill 2 hours, you can't do much better.  The cast is great, the music is great, the film is great, and even if no one remembers it ten years from now, the sheer enjoyment the audience gets from the experience is all that matters.

B00005JPGO|5.0|A great action movie that attempts to reveal to the world the ugly side of the diamond trade and the human tragedy that was the civil war in Sierra Leone. The movie is based in Sierra Leone, though actually shot in South Africa and Mozambique.<br /><br />It has great performances by Leonardo DiCaprio, particularly towards the end, and by Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly. I have no interest in diamonds whatsoever and have no view to express on their trade as a whole but it was very interesting to learn the long and complicated journey they can go sometimes, from the mine to the jewellery store. It was also very interesting to see how diamonds from this particular country possibly added to the woes of the long and bloody civil war it suffered. The chillingly ruthless rebels, the child soldiers, the routine use of limb amputation as a tool of terror. It's all here.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the evolvement of the relationship between the DiCaprio and Hounsou characters. They come from completely different sides of the story and though they start off from a place of mutual distrust and disdain, they end up depending on each other through a whirlwind of violence and emotional upheaval. The tension runs through the entire movie. Props to director Edward Zwick. He's given us a very unlikely buddy movie with a difference. A very moving tale. Deserving Oscar nominations have, alongside a couple of technical ones, gone to DiCaprio for Best Actor and to Hounsou for Best Supporting Actor.<br /><br />My only gripe is with the Sierra Leonean accents, which were the very definition of inauthenticity. I'm not from the country myself but I have friends who are and the accents made me wince. The subtitled indigenous language mainly spoken by Hounsou and the actors who played his family wasn't the problem - to be honest, I don't know if it was Mende, Temne or some other - it was the Krio (or broken English), spoken by most of the others like Captain Poison (played by the otherwise excellent David Harewood) and M'ed (played by Ntare Mwine). It was simply awful. How hard would it have been to get an expert dialect coach in or better still, to use Sierra Leonean actors? If they could get De Caprio's 'Rhodesia' accent to sound as convincing as it does, why not go all the way?<br /><br />I guess it's a minor gripe though, all said and done.

1884822312|5.0|I own the oversized hardbound edition.  I'm still around the 678th position and counting and don't intend to stop!<br /><br />Despite the terrifying title... 5,334 problems ?!, ... it's one enjoyable chess gym.  The 2-D diagrams use one of the nicest modern Staunton fonts around and are clearly printed and illustrated.  It contains an introduction, piece properties, mates in 1, mates in 2, mates in 3, combinations, simple endgames, combinations, critical positions in some of the Polar sister's games, and a solutions key (only the first move per problem).  It's a simple and effective format for an outstanding effort in putting so much material in an organized manner.  Many of the positions are implicitly aggregated by theme which does not give away any clues but allows the reader to better develop pattern recognition.  No hints, just practice.<br /><br />The softbound version makes a great gift; the hardbound is hard to find and more of a personal library book.  Only a tactical practice database or software can improve on this book.  I can only wish it were available as a database!

But I have the right to vote with my dollars and add her to list that includes Dixie Chicks, Mel Gibson, etc. - they will not get any more money from me.    Alice Cooper said it best:    \\"If you're listening to a rock star in order to get your information on who to vote for, you're a bigger moron than they are. Why are we rock stars? Because we're morons. We sleep all day, we play music at night and very rarely do we sit around reading the Washington Journal.\\"
B00005JPDU|5.0|It could be said that this is a movie about a number of things: The pursuit of the American dream, never giving up, and that if you are prepared to do whatever it takes, you can probably achieve anything. I think it also hints at the question of whether money, success and power can ever bring happiness in themselves but, wisely, it's a question the movie leaves largely unanswered.<br /><br />For me though, this movie is about a man who has an absolute and unwavering love for, and commitment to, his young son. As a man who didn't have a good relationship with his father in the past and doesn't have one at all in the present, I found the movie painfully difficult, yet exhilaratingly beautiful to watch. If more black men (or maybe even men in general) were this committed to their sons, I remember thinking, this world would be a very different place.<br /><br />The movie is based on the real-life story of the real-life Chris Gardner, a bright and talented San Francisco man who falls on bad times, suffers the breakdown of his relationship with his wife and eventually winds up homeless. Thandie Newton gives a strong performance as the waspish shrew of a wife who eventually naffs off and leaves Chris to it. (Well, to be fair to her, she did want to take the child with her but Chris put his foot down). Through all the struggles that follow, Chris always has his son at his side and this is the heart of the story.<br /><br />Though this is probably my favourite Will Smith performance since 1998's \\"Enemy Of The State\\" (and a performance that has earned Mr Smith a Best Actor Oscar nomination), for me it's his son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, who is the real star of this movie. For a first-timer, he gives a barnstorming, heartwrenching perfomance. And he's such a cutie too. I've become a hardened, jaded, unfeeling and cynical old man over the years and hardly anything touches me anymore but this movie, I felt. This one made me cry. I cried the first time I watched it and I cried even more when I watched it a second time. I can't wait for the DVD. I don't know what it is, but this movie has something special. If you haven't seen it already, I urge you to do so. Inspirational on so many levels. The real Chris Gardner makes a brief cameo appearance towards the end of the movie which just wraps it up beautifully.<br /><br />How come no soundtrack though? Apart from the score by Andrea Guerra, which granted is very good, the movie had some great music by George Benson, Stevie Wonder, Roberta Flack, Seal and The Glide Ensemble among others. I really hope they release one.ched it a second time. I can't wait for the DVD. I don't know what it is, but this movie has something special. If you haven't seen it already, I urge you to do so.

B000E5N6LG|4.0|This movie came out a few months after the other \\"Wyatt Earp\\" biopic and while everybody loved Kurt Russell's Tombstone / Wyatt Earp, this film got slammed.<br /><br />Personally, I love westerns and I really enjoyed Tombstone. But I think this was a more ambitious effort and notwithstanding the criticism that it ran too long, I think it's a better film then Tombstone.<br /><br />Tombstone was enjoyable and light and a very entertaining diversion for a couple of hours - especially the scene's which included Val Kilmer's Doc  Holliday.<br /><br />But Wyatt Earp presented a much more accurate and in-depth depiction of one of the west's most enduring characters. And unlike other Wyatt Earp / gunfight at the OK Corral pics, this film devoted quite a bit of time to the earlier years of Wyatt Earp and the events that shaped his life leading up to the infamous Gunfight.<br /><br />It presented a more in-depth portrayal of the other people in his life - Josie Marcus / his in-laws (who couldn't stand him for the \\"cold\\" character that he was) / Doc Holliday / Bat Masterson and many others.<br /><br />Personally, I would love to see a sequel to this film that picks up the lives of Wyatt and Josie after the dust had settled in Tombstone. They spent close to 50 years together and took in the goldfields of the north / horse racing and boxing in California and prospecting in Arizona.<br /><br />This novie had a fine supporting cast however, my biggest complaint would be that the actors I most enjoyed didn't have especially prominent supporting roles. Gene Hackman as Wyatt's father was great (as always) however, he didn't have alot of time on the screen. It was his father who installed in Wyatt at a young age the importance of family and justice.<br /><br />Michael Madsen, one of my favorites, played Wyatt's brother Virgil, however, he too didn't have alot of lines.<br /><br />And kudos to Dennis Quaid for his protrayal of Doc Holliday. He may not have gotten the press of Val Kilmer, but you have to respect the fact that he lost 38 lbs of weight in order to capture the appearence of a man who was been eaten up with consumption / tuberculosis.<br /><br />I think the primary reason I enjoyed this film is that it portrayed Wyatt Earp in a much more realistic light - it portrayed him as a great, but \\"flawed\\" man which, from everything I've read about the man (and that's alot of books), he was flawed. I think the death of his wife at a young age had a profound impact on Wyatt's relationships in later years. And I think this folm brought that out.<br /><br />I don't think this is a great film / western - I'll reserve that word for many of Sergio Leone's and John Ford's films, but I think it's alot better than the reviews it got at the time.<br /><br />But I'll take my hat off to Kevin Costner for making a film about Wyatt Earp that doesn't just focus on THE GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL.<br /><br />And as a fan of westerns and an avid reader of western history, I'm grateful to him for making this movie. And in view of the fact that so few westerns are made these days, I'm certainly not complaining about the 3 hours plus of this film.ess of Val Kilmer, but you have to respect the fact that he lost 38 lbs of weight in order to capture the appearence of a man who was been eaten up with consumption / tuberculosis. <br /> <br />I think the primary reason I enjoyed this film is that it portrayed Wyatt Earp in a much more realistic light - it portrayed him as a great, but \\"flawed\\" man which, from everything I've read about the man (and that's alot of books), he was flawed.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Unfortunately, you are either a disseminator of disinformation or one of the unfortunate individuals who have been duped by the \\"corporatocracy\\" here in America (and abroad). The evidence is overwhelming that mankind is exacerbating the global warming phenomenon; period--end of argument.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the reality is simply this--finding a solution to global warming would deal a fatal blow to the profiteers that stand to lose the most money (hence \\"An Incontinent Truth\\") while the rest of us, and our posterity, stand to lose what little \\"hospitable\\" environment we have left. It is bad enough that pollution and other environmental stressors have tainted our planet with disease, but what's even worse are the effects of the ever-increasing carbon emissions into our atmosphere and what they will do in the not so distant future (because of people like you [the naysayer] that refuse to admit or see the truth).<br /><br />If you have simply been duped, I hope you come around and peace finds you and your family as we stand a modicum of hope to overcome this impending crisis. If you are part of the false propagandists, however, then you are akin to a lethal virus that needs to be eradicated. That is not a threat--that is simply an analogy because, if we do not start seriously addressing the global warming issue, many of us will stand to be wiped out as the climate shifts at an accelerated and intensified rate. What perhaps you and others are insidiously trying to do is mix fact with fiction, exploiting the former with the latter by using a teleological fallacy which ultimately results in a very dubious and slippery slope which will have disastrous consequences.<br /><br />What's worse is that the plutocracy found in American and throughout the world will cease at nothing to protect their profit margins by paying off pseudo scientists to produce bogus studies which provide \\"plausible deniability\\" for companies like Exxon and politicians on the right (and left) in need of the political cover necessary to legislate and prevent laws to support the wealthiest 1% of our population.<br /><br />The power of the \\"corporatocracy\\" must be stopped, and it is not limited to the global warming phenomenon (albeit it is the worst problem of all). Their power is also the driving force behind the malevolent distribution of wealth and resources in society--a concentration of wealth that FDR fought so hard to cease and prevent for future generations; all of which came to a grinding halt after the breakup of ATT and Reagan's unwavering support of economic principles he understood little himself, but which had huge economic advantages to the overwhelming corporations that have grown up ever since and the individuals at their helm who profit from them the most).  These \\"anti anti-monopoly\\" practices continue to have adverse repercussions for the rest of us today--and the problem is only getting worse.<br /><br />Global warming, or our lack to mobilize efforts in opposition to the man-made and overwhelming portion of it, is simply the greatest symptom of a fundamental flaw in American politics...  the illusion of democracy (or rather, the illusion of a democratic-republic) here in the United States and in other \\"democratic\\" nations around the world. The power, both public and private, simply doesn't reside in the hand of the people anymore--that's the illusion--it really rests in relatively few people and families that pull the strings for the rest of us.<br /><br />The greatest cure for our problems, including global warming, is addressing the underlying political flaws which prevent us from dealing with them equitably and sensibly in the first place. To do that, we need to embrace the spirit of the 2nd Amendment so that we can bring something more than empty threats to the political round table--we can bring the reality of an armed citizenry that refuses to allow corporations (and government) to abuse capitalism in a way that runs over the overwhelming majority of people.  Conscientious capitalism can work, but conscientious conservatism, as practiced, cannot.<br /><br />I don't have time to thoroughly argue the 2nd Amendment portion of my argument here, but if you are a naysayer, I would admonish you to rethink your opinions in such matters as mentioned thereof and get on the right side of things with the rest of us--after all--we the people prevailed in 1776, so there is a good chance we may overcome tyranny again (wherever and whenever it exists)...<br /><br />Remember, global warming is symptomatic of a greater problem Thomas Jefferson often spoke of.  It isn't just the corporations; it's the banks (and specifically, the Federal Reserve, the private institution that heads them all--a duty delegated to congress in the American Constitutions which was later subverted by the Supreme Court).  Jefferson wrote...<br /><br />\\"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.\\"<br /><br />Considering you really don't own your home if you have a mortgage--Jefferson was right.  What takes thirty years and two to three times the price of your home to begin with should take a fraction of that time and cost to your god-given right to own your home.  We'll never fix this problem, or global warming, without first addressing \\"the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks]\\" to begin with.<br /><br />But how is this ever going to happen if our politicians, and the heads of banks and corporations surrounding them, don't take us seriously?  If a British soldier knocked on your door in 1776, chances are that he would have a musket similar to the one you had hidden behind your door (and to the one that fired \\"the first shot heard `round the world\\" in Concord, Massachusetts the previous year).  Even though you would be outnumbered by the local British garrison, they would in turn be outnumbered by your neighbors (which made up the local militia).  The spirit of the militia is what has been lost since the American Revolution; and its loss is the cause of corporate greed, government intrusion, the gross maldistribution of wealth in this country (and around the world), and crime.  Thank about it; if everyone walked around with a sidearm like you'd see in some old western, virtually no one would consider perpetrating a crime against you (as the movie industry would have you believe).  Just as it served to subvert the Cold War, MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), an ever-armed citizenry would virtually eliminate violent crime.  It wouldn't be necessary for every single person to carry a firearm (such as children, adolescents, or a habitual criminal recently released from prison); it simply require enough people so that the chances of someone concealing a weapon would be far greater than not.<br /><br />Like Jefferson and our forefathers, I don't advocate violence for \\"light an transient reasons\\", but global warming and other problems that plague Americans and citizens around the world (like the refusal for universal healthcare and terrorism), are so insurmountable that violence, or the threat of it, is sometimes the only way to resolve the seemingly irresolvable.  The only way to be a threat to the heads of corporations and opportunists in government is to ensure we have an armed citizenry--an armed citizenry that has the right to \\"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\\" afforded by the Constitution and guaranteed via the first and second amendments of the Bill of Rights.<br /><br />It's important that our citizenry can see this connection between:  global warming and other problems we face in the world, \\"the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks]\\", our government, the Constitution, and the 2nd Amendment within it.  We have the power, but human nature sometimes prevents us from using it.  Just as Al Gore uses the analogy of the frog in \\"an inconvenient truth\\", Jefferson mentioned our inability to use the power of the people in the Declaration of Independence when he wrote, \\"all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.\\"  But he also immediately went on to say, \\"But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security.\\"<br /><br />I am as \\"liberal\\" as the next guy when it comes to universal healthcare, protectionist measures to ensure fair trade (to protect both companies and their workers), and unions to ensure humane conditions in the workplace, etc...  but global warming is going to have catastrophic consequences if we don't quell this \\"long Train of Abuses and Usurpations.\\"  To do this, we need to go back to the fundamental right to bear arms--that way we have teeth able to hold politicians and the heads of corporations accountable.  With embracing the 2nd Amendment and creating a culture of arms, we remain toothless in the flight against global warming.take us seriously?

B000KCHZK6|1.0|I think Norah Jones' second and third album prove that she was  overrated.  The lady cannot write songs.  And her vocals are limited.  Even the songs that she wrote on her first album weren't that good.  As far as I am concerned, the only reason the first album was a success was because all of the good songs were written by someone else.  They should've given the Grammy for Best Album to Bruce Springsteen's \\"The Rising\\" instead.

This audio clips on the main page don't do any of the tracks justice ... they sound warped, tinny, and flat ... just buy it.

Their children being a young couple still in high school with so much of their life ahead of them, when Emily seems to fall off the path and her boyfriend, Chris, loves her so much that he is willing to do anything for her... anything. Be forewarned this is not in any way a cheesy romance novel that you will chalk up to a \\"Drugstore Romance Novel\\".

Though I am an atheist, and have been most of my life, the writing is so well-done and Professor Dawkins is so articulate that it was still enlightening to read his insights. <br />And yes, for the most part, any true appreciation of this book will simply amount to preaching to the choir. But so what? After all, adherents to the various \\"organized\\" religions attend their respective churches to hear sermons on stuff they already are aware of (or you would presume so; actually most of them are pretty ignorant of their own theologies). So too do those like me occasionally need a little lifting of the spirits, a lucid voice rising distinct from the rest of the noise that infests our ridiculous human condition.

The staging, energy and dancing makes this concert fun and interesting to watch. No one star at Madonna's age can go on stage and give such a high energy performance as she does. She rules the music industry in concerts and entertaining her fans. I admit though, Girlie Show and Drowned World Tour were not great, but makes a huge comeback with 'Confession on a Dancefloor', she lives up to her promise, Dance til you drop!
B00005JPDY|4.0|I went to see this film because Regis Philbin said it was the latest spy film out and it was great.    I expected a James Bond type thriller with all the action, women, gadgets, etc. that we come to expect from films of that genre.  I was disappointed with the opening scenes of the film when it became apparent that the time frame was the Kennedy era, and I was thinking, oh great, no computers, no cells phones, and no gadgets are going to add up to boring.....    As the movie unfolded, I was pleasantly surprised that the subject matter of how the CIA was formed was presented in an interesting, intriguing,  and intelligent manner.  All the actors and director, Robert DeNiro, deserve much praise with this effort.    All the prior reviews that describe the pro's and con's of this film are pretty accurate, but overall it's worth the trip to the theatre with one caveat, if you are under 45 or 50, you probably won't be interested in it unless you are a history buff.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|We missed this movie in the theater, and it finally popped up to the top in our netflix queue, a bit like cream rising to the top of the milk churn. This is an extremely well done biopic, that limits itself to the early career of Johnny Cash's life. The script is almost a little too clever, or perhaps the source material--Cash's own autobiographies--made things a little too clear, in that sometimes the connections between his actions and his childhood are so strong that it's like the screenwriter went in with a highlighter and marked the passages for you. For example, Cash and his brother go fishing in the first five minutes, and as they walk down the dirt road they run forward and slide in the dirt as well as balance the fishing poles in the palms of their hand. Later, when Cash leaves home to join the army, his joy in finally escaping the harsh confines of his father's house is shown by him running and sliding in the dirt, and then even later in the film he and June Carter go fishing, you see him balancing the pole in his hand, an indication of how much joy this is bringing him.<br /><br />While almost distracting, such clear connections don't get in the way of the story, and the screenwriters have done a great job in concentrating on the love story between Cash and Carter. Everything in this movie builds to that, showing exactly why Cash was a boozer and an addict, the struggle between his success and his first wife, and how the music connected him to Carter, who had her own issues as the scion of country music's first family. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon are wonderfully understated in their portrayals, especially in the darker sections which has to be one of the better representations on screen of drug and alcohol addiction.<br /><br />What's somewhat missing, although implied in several scenes, is a depiction of Cash and Carter's religious faith. The DVD contains some of the scenes that hit the cutting room floor and it looks like much of the more overt religious parts were excised in the final version, likely because they didn't feed as much into the courting part of their relationship and was more part of their lasting love for each other. If anything, this movie leaves you wanting more, to see a more complete life of Cash, and if anything, that's a triumph in itself.igious parts were excised in the final version, likely because they didn't feed as much into the courting part of their relationship and was more part of their lasting love for each other.

015603283X|5.0|Lucas Corso deals in rare and antique books or to put in more aptly he is what amounts to a book mercenary. He operates in the shadows matching up books to collectors and collectors to books. He is the person a collector calls when they have a hole in their collection and need to find that certain book to fill that hole. He will find their book, one way or another, and the collector can expect to pay handsomely for the new addition to their collection. His high status among collectors is exactly what gets him into trouble in this wonderful story of intrigue, romance, mystery and skullduggery in the world of book collecting.<br /><br />It all starts when his friend, book dealer Flavio La Ponte comes into possession of a handwritten manuscript of one chapter of Alexandre Dumas' \\"The Three Musketeers.\\" La Ponte turns to his friend Corso to authenticate his recent acquisition at about the same time that one of Corso's client's calls on him to authenticate a book that he has recently purchased. For some unknown reason this client doesn't think that his book is the real thing and sends Corso off to prove or disprove the books authenticity. This book, \\"The Book of the Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows\\" was supposedly taken straight from a book written by the Devil himself and the author was burned at the stake for printing such a book. There are only three copies known to exist and Corso must examine the other two to make a determination about his client's copy. He immediately sets off on his dual missions and unexplainable events dog him from the start. Before it is all over he has almost been killed on several occasions and everywhere he goes he seems to leave a trail of dead bodies.<br /><br />Without going into anymore detail and spoiling the book I can tell you that at times this reads like a Dumas novel and even features some characters from the \\"Musketeers.\\" Along with the swashbuckling Dumas like adventure though there is also a much darker thread running through the story and even if you have watched the movie based on this book part of the ending will come as a complete surprise. There are in fact several major differences between the movie and the book and as is usually the case the book is much better than the movie. Amazingly the author even manages to work a little Sherlock Holmes into this story.<br /><br />As a great fan of Dumas I would naturally love this book and being a lover of books in general added to my enjoyment of this superb story. I am quite sure however that anyone would enjoy this book almost as much as I did even if you don't drool as the author describes the great book collections that become part of this tale. As I read of poor old Victor Fargas who's heart broke each time he had to sell a book in order to survive my heart almost broke, which is evidence of both my love for books and this author's writing ability. It has been a while since I have read any Dumas but I think that I will soon return to that old master for another dose of his storytelling ability.

Amazingly the author even manages to work a little Sherlock Holmes into this story.  <br /> <br />As a great fan of Dumas I would naturally love this book and being a lover of books in general added to my enjoyment of this superb story. I am quite sure however that anyone would enjoy this book almost as much as I did even if you don't drool as the author describes the great book collections that become part of this tale. As I read of poor old Victor Fargas who's heart broke each time he had to sell a book in order to survive my heart almost broke, which is evidence of both my love for books and this author's writing ability. It has been a while since I have read any Dumas but I think that I will soon return to that old master for another dose of his storytelling ability. A master in whose footsteps this author is ably following.
B000002J1S|3.0|I absolutely was mad for Genesis when Peter Gabriel was the lead singer, but it took me more than 30 years before I purchased THE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY in any recorded format, and now I think I know what possibly took me so long. I was suspicious of a British progressive rock band trying to spin a tale about the streets of New York City, and I was right---there's mostly no story here, and when there is it sounds like BORN TO RUN-era Bruce Springsteen shot through with Philip K. Dick. Unfortunately, while the band is all on top of their game chops-wise, the music is shoehorned into this bizarre \\"epic,\\" and little of what's recorded is enough to sustain one's attention beyond the cursory. Steve Hackett, guitarist for the band at the time, likened TLLDOB to a \\"breach-birth,\\" essentially saying that Gabriel and the rest of the band rarely got together for more than a few days at a time while recording this album. The whole thing taken together sounds exactly that way.<br /><br />NURSERY CRYME, FOXTROT, GENESIS LIVE and SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND were all stupendous achievements....THE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY is a \\"nice try.\\"
B000EOTEPO|5.0|If you dont know who Immortal are, then there is a good chance you listen to *hitty music. Out of all the black metal bands to come and go, this band is by far the most solid. Combining Norwegian black metal with hints of death metal, they've pumped out opus after opus of intense, catchy black metal that hits your ears like sheets of ice. This CD is so cold, you'll have to listen to this with your thermostat up high and with a wool blanket around you.<br /><br />If you liked this album, I suggest getting Emperor's Prometheus, Old Man Child's Vermin, and my favorite Black metal album, Dissection's Storm of the Light's Bane: Where Dead Angels Lie.
B000K9L32U|5.0|This is a mature-sounding, adult contemporary album which has been achieved critical and commerical success. And deservedley so. Take That really are a \\"man band\\" now and there are moments on this album in which they sound really different than their old selves. Gone are the \\"Relight My Fire\\" and \\"Pray\\" ditties, this really is a mature album which brings them up to date and can easily rival Robbie's best effort \\"Intensive Care\\". All four worked with successful and international producer/songwriter John Shanks and together they have achieved excellent results in the shape of \\"Reach Out\\", \\"Shine\\" and especially \\"Patience\\", which I need not remind everyone, spent four weeks at the Number 1 spot, just like \\"Back for Good\\" did. Another difference with this album is that all four members not only co-writes but also takes it turns to stand in the front of the mic. Gary has six songs (including the bonus track, a hidden gem which Robbie frequently employs, but Gary doesn't even take the title track), while Mark has three tracks (including the Beatlesque next single \\"Shine\\", presumably a song to Robbie), Howard has two tracks and Jason has the folky Saw Doctors-like \\"Wooden Boat\\". But as before, it's Gary that shines the most with the instantly likeable \\"Reach Out\\", the wonderful rock ballad \\"Like I Never Loved You At All\\" and \\"Ain't No Sense in Love\\". It's a shame Gary isn't on it more. Lyrically, however, this is a strong album. Melodically, it's the best they've done. Musically, it's different than before.  <br />
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Her voice just keeps getting better.  The music selections are varied and very interesting.  The arrangements are fantastic.  I got it today and listed all the way through so this is an initial view, but if I like it the first time through, it only gets better the more I listen.  Buy it!
B0007M22TI|5.0|I just caught this yesterday on PBS.  I was a fan of their voices but had never seen them perform.  They actually had a whole stage show like a regular concert.  With moves and everything.  It was really nice to watch.  The music is as soothing as ever.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I first saw kenny back in in '97 at st. andrews hall in detroit. when he came out he just blew everyone away. at that time, even though he was just starting out, you would think he was at the top of his game. solo after solo were blistered at you. no let up & you could feel the passion he had for the blues.  <br />well, he has top that time period by putting out 10 days out. I had no clue of what this package would contain or the thought & energy & time it would take to put together is amazing. most cd/dvd sets are just put out for the cash. this one is put out for the love of the music & the artist of pass, present &  future (kenny). he goes place to place finding some of the blues greatest players & talking to them about their experinces & actually jamming with them on stage. the dvd is alone 106 mins. long. plus they have videos you can watch to. jerry harrison (talking heads) is the man that helps put this together with kenny to bring the love of the blues music back & pay  tribute to it. the booklet is fantastic. if we only could have this in lp size, that would be the icing on the cake. <br />the only thing to worry about is that if you're looking for a all out balls playing like kenny does on his cds you won't find it here. there is some but he is paying tribute to the men who started the blues.  <br />thank god for the blind, we probably wouldn't have kenny wayne sheperd.
B000002KIE|5.0|Review no.437.Seriously if you don't have (or at least) like this historic classic punk CD reissue to 'some' degree, you SHOULD get b**ch slapped upside your stupid head, Beavis! Still cannot believe to THIS very day, this is the ONLY actual album the Sex Pistols put out. All the others are compilations and live archive recordings. 'Never Mind...' has all (if not,more) than any true punk fan could possibly ask for, head-smacking guitar, frantic drumming, thundering bass and Johnny Rotten yowling like caged wilder beast. Tunes that'll have your dorky neighbors begging you to turn the stereo down are \\"Holiday In The Sun\\", \\"No Feeling\\", \\"God Save The Queen\\" (also liked Motorhead's version), \\"Anarchy In The UK\\", the awesome \\"Pretty Vacant\\" (my personal favorite) and \\"EMI\\". Couple of other Sex Pistols titles you should seek out, if you haven't already are their reunion effort 'Filthy Lucre Live' and 'Raw' CD's (see my reviews of both) So highly recommended, it hurts.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I am glad that Al Gor has focused on scientific facts and data instead of on subjective opinions and perceptions. There is plenty of information which I learnt and I am sure that this DVD will be eye-opening for every open-minded person. It is better to know these details and forecasts because we all may be seriously affected in the near future and we have to be prepared.
B000EMGAGW|2.0|This Mobb album is different, but its still MOBB. Like time, style changes up, whether you like it or not. For example, Bone Thugs N Harmony....compare their E.1999 Eternal album to their latest releases. So if you're a true MOBB fan, just adjust yourself to the new times, hate it or love it.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|if your a fan pick it up the dvd has some great stuff as well  <br />               up the irons!!!!
B00005JKN9|4.0|A few nights ago, my husband and I watched \\"Gangs of New York\\" (2002). It was not as bad as everyone said it was. We watched it on a cable network that mercifully cut or blurred most of the extreme violence, nudity, and foul language. The score was phenomenal, especially the use of the violin music. The Irish songs in the background amidst the total squalor and corruption of Five Points were very moving. One senses the indomitable spirit of a fighting people. We always forget what the immigrants experienced when they first landed here. I can see why my great-great-great grandfather preferred to settle in Canada where he had to deal with wolves and some prejudice but otherwise he was alone in the wilderness; no nasty street gangs. <br /> <br />I wish I knew more about the Irish experience in New York City. Was someone like \\"Bill the Butcher\\" really allowed to go around chopping people up? People have compared Bill the Butcher, masterfully played by Daniel Day Lewis, to Bill Sykes in Dickens' \\"Oliver Twist,\\" but I think it is a weak comparison. Bill Sykes was an ignorant, blundering, repellent, murdering psychopath but Bill the Butcher was a cunning, devious, charming, murdering psychopath. The scene when they were all dancing with the candles was sheer beauty. However, it ruined the romance when the hero and heroine had to immediately have a roll in the hay; it destroyed the ambiance, totally. <br /> <br />All the acting was superb. I usually do not care for Cameron Diaz and some critics thought that she was miscast. I beg to differ; I thought she made a great tavern wench, with that tough, hungry, wounded look. Yet she sparkled with audacity and hope, in spite of her surroundings. The sets were gruesomely realistic; we could almost smell the dung and waste in the streets. <br />
B000EOTAM6|4.0|This is an action/adventure film set a little in the future. I would recomend getting this. This has a lot of violance and not for children.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|So glad that this wonderful and inspiring movie finally made it to CD format.  Wonderful quality.  This is my husband's all-time favorite movie and it is definitely worth viewing again and again for the inspirational message it delivers.
B000JVT09C|4.0|The Blu-ray transfer is fantastic; it looks exactly as it did in the theater. The movie is also very good (at least on par with the best of the previous Superman movies and much better than the last two.) The audio track is OK but no lossless track detracts somewhat from the disc. There are also hours of extras included (I still haven't watched all of them.)<br /><br />Overall a very good addition to any Blu-Ray collection.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Since the times of David Ward Griffith' s Intolerance - the supreme Godfather of the rest of the American filmmakers - in 1916, I had never seen before another film so rich in textures, epic stature, tragic consistence, existential meaning and chromatic variations about the human behavior, no matter the proceeding latitude. Alejandro Gonzalez I&ntilde;arritu employs the desert not only as a visual resource but as a big tapestry on which exposes, warns and denounces some aberrant ways of thinking, feeling, and living.<br /><br />The desert to my mind, is the key to find important references in this sense. First at all, the desert as wasteland, the last frontier of the unthinkable or unimaginable: Marrakech: a rifle, two children at the eve of their growing up maturity, who are really convinced about the innocence of their insane action, exemplifies the ingenuity is masked of an invisible violence almost genetic, inherited by ancestors. In his family, the boredom and penuries also constitute a wilderness of affective deficit.<br /><br />Second: The North American couple who travels to Marrakech and just want to feel the silence (Remember the clever line pronounced by Pitt), once more the desert of the miscommunication, the existential boredom makes he had decided to go in search of that vanished experience.<br /><br />Third: the desert of the soul in the Mexican housekeeper who breaks the rules in order to share an evening of solace amusement to be present in her son's wedding.<br /><br />Four: the desert of the loneliness due the deafness in one of the most cosmopolitan cities of the world, where the young people gather in a noisy oasis, but that sensitive girl with serious emotional sequels, just wishes to be listened and loved, but her restriction defines for the rest of the people, a desert of merciless intolerance signed by a supposed reference frame; when smartly the director opens the objective of the camera to show us the variegated swarm of human people joining in the intersections of two avenues.<br /><br />Five: the desert of the self-centered attitude ( the desert of the selfishness) of the rest of the passengers who accompanied to the young couple fallen in disgrace due that absurd incident.<br /><br />Six: the desert of the linguistic barriers who makes us feel like the deaf girl, when we listen without understanding and need our conventional and universally prosthesis device: the subtitles in our own language.<br /><br />Seven: the desert of the legal rules at the moment of the return from Mexico. There are no arguments. The law is the law (Kafka' s echoes?)<br /><br />Eighth: the desert of the affective silence who is beautifully depicted in the last shot of the film.<br /><br />The script is admirably made, with a perfect edition process ( I guess this will be one of the secure awards the next February 25), the employment of the music as dramatic support, as well as the rest of secondary dramatic lines as the imprudence of the housekeeper, the ignorance of the destructive power of a weapon and the legal barriers in which the political environment seemed to prevail above the value of a human life at the moment to rescue to Cate Blanchet in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />If the desert was a smart metaphor employed by Stroheim in Greed, John Huston in The treasure of the sierra Madre, David Lean in Lawrence of Arabia and Stanley Kubrick in the first movement of 2001, this talented director employed it as a big frame to make us understand the globalization still remains into the closet and just applies for science and development for totally restricted to other areas of the humankind.<br /><br />A true thousand carats  film, that should be win the Academy Award the next 25. But regardless, it will remain as one of the most ambitious films ever made that has achieved an important place in the Cinema from its instantaneous release.<br /><br />Bravo!es.    Five: the desert of the self-centered attitude ( the desert of the selfishness) of the rest of the passengers who accompanied to the young couple fallen in disgrace due that absurd incident.    Six: the desert of the linguistic barriers who makes us feel like the deaf girl, when we listen without understanding and need our conventional and universally prosthesis device: the subtitles in our own language.    Seven: the desert of the legal rules at the moment of the return from Mexico. There are no arguments. The law is the law (Kafka' s echoes?)     Eighth: the desert of the affective silence who is beautifully depicted in the last shot of the film.     The script is admirably made, with a perfect edition process ( I guess this will be one of the secure awards the next February 25), the employment of the music as dramatic support, as well as the rest of secondary dramatic lines as the imprudence of the housekeeper, the ignorance of the destructive power of a weapon and the legal barriers in which the political environment seemed to prevail above the value of a human life at the moment to rescue to Cate Blanchet in the middle of nowhere.    If the desert was a smart metaphor employed by Stroheim in Greed, John Huston in The treasure of the sierra Madre, David Lean in Lawrence of Arabia and Stanley Kubrick in the first movement of 2001, this talented director employed it as a big frame to make us understand the globalization still remains into the closet and just applies for science and development for totally restricted to other areas of the humankind.    A true thousand carats  film, that should be win the Academy Award the next 25. But regardless, it will remain as one of the most ambitious films ever made that has achieved an important place in the Cinema from its instantaneous release.     Bravo!
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|It's like a time machine back to 1956! This movie just pops off the screen in Technicolor and VistaVision. Probably looks better than when it was shown 50 years ago. Nice Special features with vintage actor interviews and a theatrical trailer. The Duke is too cool. They don't make them like him anymore. Excellent Transfer!
B000001GQB|5.0|The Symphony No. 41 in C major Kv 551 best known as Jupiter retakes and maintains the most representative epic spirit of Mozart like any one Symphony. It breaths liberty, Dionysian pleasure and that essential rapture so common in the masterpieces. And under Bohm's baton exudates full aristocratic sound.<br /><br />In spite of the fact it has been recorded so many times, just a few directors have been able to extract and carve in relief the majestic splendor of this K.<br /><br />On the other hand the version of the 38th Symphony is simply majestic and radiant. Bohm never abuses of excess of elegance and his pristine lyricism may be easily realized.<br /><br />Karl Bohm was indeed, one of the most representative Ambassadors of the Mozart symphonic repertoire. The Berlin Philharmonic, fortunately still maintained the noble sound inherited from Furtwangler and then Fricsay and that was a decisive fact to his favor.
B00005JM20|5.0|I've always enjoyed the world of suave spies and all of their gadgets.  Giving Rowan Atkinson access to this world sets the stage for many laughs.  I was struck by how creatively he can get himself into a variety of messes.  The best mess of the movie is when is Aston Martin is towed and he highjacks the truck.  His physical \\"Mr. Bean\\" humor tied to his \\"spy-ish\\" good looks makes his character one of the best that I've seen in a long time.  Three cheers for a great, clean comedy.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I have not read or seen the other Emmas, so I cannot comment on the comparisons.  It seems from other reviewers however that this movie deviates from the book, as many movies do.  Therefore, if you are looking for a literal translation of the book, this movie will not do.<br /><br />That being said, this movie on its own is a joy to watch.  The cast was believable in their relationships with one another.  The scenes were all filmed in Dorset and London I believe.  The humor is well timed, the actors do not overact, and the style of language is much more proper than what we speak today, as should be expected from the upper class of the 19th century.<br /><br />Overall, I found this movie to be a delight, and a heartwarming one at that.  A nice feel good movie to raise your spirits.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Sex and the City has characters that represent (in some small way) the thoughts/feelings/actions of average 30something women in the US. Every episode has a one-liner or even an entire theme ('secret single behaviors', shoe fetishes, twentysomething guys, etc) that every guy could stand to learn something from. So, guys, grab a beer, order a pizza, and watch a few episodes to get some insight into the women in your lives!
B000003N7R|5.0|These classic albums Coltrane did for Impulse are some of my personal favorites (i.e. 'John Coltane w/ Johnny Hartman', 'Ballads', and 'Ascension') of all the jazz recordings I own on either CD or Vinyl.  This one is a beauty!  Every song on this album is perfect.  So many times two greats would meet and cut an album of less than superior quality.  This is definitely not one of those cases.  From the moment the first song 'In a Sentimental Mood' comes on you are taken on a magical journey that truly showcases just how brilliant these artists were as musicians and composers.  Of course it's always great to have such a fine rythm section backing you up - Jimmy Garrison, Elvin Jones (awesome as always!), Aaron Bell, Sam Woodward, ... all playing at their best.  If you are a fan of Ellington and/or Coltrane than obviously this is a must have album.  All in all, it's just fun, exciting music that gives you a warm, cushy feeling inside every time you listen to it.  Those of you who are relatively new to jazz, this is a must have.  You won't be disappointed I promise.
B000IMV4IW|3.0|...then chances are you've listened to these songs at least a million flippin' times!  This is not a \\"compilation\\" for \\"fans\\", but a snapshot to be placed inside a time capsule as a treat for tomorrow's \\"would be\\" Oasis listeners. <br />Over seven years ago, after disappointment after disappointment with SOTSOG, HC and...dang, I can't even remember the name of the album that followed that (btw, as with many other \\"true\\" Oasis fans, BHN is still my favorite Oasis album, top to top, and also signifies the end of Oasis as \\"Oasis\\", the headstone of the mayhem), I still managed to listen to the boys a bit here and there and compiled my own bootleg album of Oasis \\"anthems\\", including a nice middle set of classic Noel acoustics (a staple for anyone who's ever seen the Brothers live).  So, here goes: <br /> <br />1.   Listen Up (extended version) <br />2.   Rockin' Chair (a bit \\"Beatle-esque, but much more raw than Lennon-McCartney could ever be) <br />3.   Wonderwall (of course) <br />4.   Sunday Morning Call (after the first listen of this song I had to play it again back-to-back, as if for proof of its existence.  I just couldn't believe how beautiful it was.) <br />5.   Little By Little (again, of course) <br />6.   Talk Tonight (thus begins Noel's acoustic) <br />7.   Half the World Away (Paul Weller's fav) <br />8.   Angel Child (demo...don't ask) <br />9.   Heroes (better than even Bowie himself) <br />10.  Magic Pie (alone worth the purchase of BHN) <br />11.  Don't Look Back In Anger (once heard this song sung by a drunken wedding party in backwoods Ireland.  Priceless!) <br />12.  Live Forever (...\\"Er, that's if you want to.\\" - Liam, live, Cigarettes and Alcohol single) <br />13.  Whatever (classic Noel rip-off, but still the best single never released in the US) <br />14.  Married with Children (how is it nobody ever talks about this song?  A classic cook-kitchen end-of-the-night work song!) <br /> <br />So there you have it.  My very own Oasis \\"compilation\\".  Savvy?
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I was a little trepid about this purchase because I really enjoyed the self-titled but don't generally listen any more.  I was WAY WRONG.  This CD is totally fantastic.  There is so much more depth to both the lyrics and the instruments.  I can't get enough, especially of \\"Lithium\\".  Amy, you keep going!  The variations in your voice, your ability to convey emotions, feelings, and attitude in your voice, and your complex yet obtainable lyrics combine to create a great experience involving a range of emotions, musical enjoyment, and bodily reaction (yes...I dance in my chair at work!).
B000KCHZK6|2.0|If you're buying this C.D because you loved her first, Come Away With Me, and are hoping that it compensates for her second album, Feels Like Home; DO NOT buy her latest release.  However, if you are intrigued by her artistic progression you may enjoy It's Not Too Late.<br /><br />I personally felt as if I were listening to some scary soundract of a carnival film during the first half of the C.D and just didn't enoy the rest.  I was really hoping that this would be a rivival of her multi-grammy winning unique sound.  But not to be too critical of her. There is no doubt that she is a courageously talented women who isn't in the business for popular approval but rather her own artistic indulgence.
B0000UJDLM|1.0|I have the VHS tape of this movie, I really like it. <br />I decided to buy the DVD version for better image quality and <br />some bonus features. But I found that the image quality is not <br />better than VHS version. And there is absolutely no single <br />bonus feature. You can only choose, \\"play main feature\\". <br />Even worse, it does not even have any caption or subtitle. <br />At least the VHS had closed caption. <br />This DVD is sort of \\"just watch once and throw it to the garbage can\\" <br />quality. If so, why don't you buy a better featured VHS ?
078681859X|5.0|The Amulet of Amarkand is a uniquely remarkable book and the first of it's genre that I wasn't able to put down since The Harry Potter Books. If you're a fan of these kinds of fantasy novels, no doubt you won't regret giving this a go!
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I have listened to this album over and over since thursday, and I cannot get enough of it. I think that Norah is beginning to discover where she wants to go as an artist, and the variety of instruments and chord progressions. I love her artistry on this album, and her courage to record songs that hint at current politics. It's a rare thing for people to take a stand nowadays when disagreeing on policy makes you a \\"terrorist.\\" Her critique is tasteful, and shows that we don't need to be animals in the political arena.  <br />Not Too Late is a definite necessity for people who enjoyed her previous albums.
B00015TOCY|5.0|They removed the \\"noise\\" at the beginning of Third Uncle. <br />It was definitely part of the song. I'm very glad I held on to the unremastered version in the cheap plastic case. <br /> <br />I would say this is his best album (including all the ambient records)
B000KGGLCU|5.0|In 2007, Madonna released her eighteenth album entitled, THE CONFESSIONS TOUR. This album is, obviously, a live compilation from Madonna's successful 2006 tour of the same name. The album is, undoubtedly, incredible, despite omitting eight tracks from the tour's setlist. The live CD includes only thirteen tracks from Madonna's CONFESSIONS TOUR, and those thirteen tracks are:    FUTURE LOVERS/I FEEL LOVE  LIKE A VIRGIN  JUMP  Confessions  ISAAC  SORRY  Sorry (Remix)  I LOVE NEW YORK  LET IT WILL BE  MUSIC Inferno  EROTICA  LUCKY STAR  HUNG UP        Now, as I said before, nine songs were omitted from the CD, only for time limitations, since CDs can carry up to only 80 minutes worth of music. Those nine songs are \\"Get Together\\", \\"Live To Tell\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Like It Or Not\\", \\"Ray Of Light\\", \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\", \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\", & \\"La Isla Bonita\\". But, either way, the CD is simply amazing, and it will have you dancing non-stop. As a bonus, included with the CD, is a DVD of the entire concert, where Madonna performed the show in London (same concert as featured on the CD). The DVD Tracklisting (which is also the full setlist to the entire tour) is as follows:    FUTURE LOVERS/I FEEL LOVE  GET TOGETHER  LIKE A VIRGIN  JUMP  Dancers Interlude: CONFESSIONS  LIVE TO TELL  FORBIDDEN LOVE  ISAAC  SORRY  LIKE IT OR NOT  Video Interlude: SORRY (Remix)  I LOVE NEW YORK  RAY OF LIGHT  LET IT WILL BE  DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE  PARADISE (NOT FOR ME)  MUSIC Inferno  EROTICA  LA ISLA BONITA  LUCKY STAR  HUNG UP        The DVD, as you can see from the tracklisting above, is the full-length concert from Madonna's show in London (her shows from August 13, 15, & 16, to be exact). The show is in its entirety, without anything being cut or edited. This CD+DVD combo is definitely the Madonna item for all of us fans. I can safely say that my all-time favorite performances here are \\"Future Lovers/I Feel Love\\", \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Live To Tell\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Isaac\\", \\"Sorry\\", \\"Like It Or Not\\", \\"Ray Of Light\\", \\"Let It Will Be\\", \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\", \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\", \\"Music Inferno\\", \\"Erotica\\", \\"La Isla Bonita\\", & \\"Hung Up\\". Frankly, I feel like I'm about to buy another copy for myself, just to have another copy within my Madonna collection. An awesome buy for all us Madonna fans.
B00005OAE6|5.0|Yes people. I went out yesterday to see if I could see my shadow. All the townspeople clapped because I saw it! You know what this means, don't you? At least 6 MORE WEEKS of Metamorpho reviews! And, hopefully many more when the weather gets balmy (although some out there think I'm balmy enough already. Go figure). In any event- I am now imprisoned in my environment due to 2 feet of snow outside. So, I have grabbed a hot toddy and am now ready to reflect on this fine selection. Oh, before I forget, I resolved the imitation issue with my apprentice T. He had dated video tape to prove his whereabouts. He, however, directed your Metamorpho to a prankster named Jack. I will let you know how this turns out.<br /><br />In an effort to rock on and prove to Guido a few things, I have picked Bob Seger's excellent \\"Stranger In Town\\" to review. What can one say about this gifted rock artist? I have always seen Seger as a white rock-soul artist (listen to that gritty soulful vocal approach!), but I do not like labels and, thus, you colour in your own impressions.<br /><br />Some fine rock and ballads inhabit this great album. And he has hit upon at least one all-time classic with the airy, lovely \\"We've Got Tonight\\". Just a generous gem for sure.<br /><br />The key motif for alot of Seger's songs seems to be his relationships with women. How their meeting is intense, how they come together like a blaze and, unfortunately, how they both move on. He moves along the slippery slope of human connections. However, wisely, sprinkles the music with a balance of rave-ups, excitement, melancholy, regrets and, finally, rambling forward with his quest. The rockers rock, the easier rock is smooth and glossy, and the ballads are all heartfelt. Quite nice.<br /><br />We begin with that train-gallop of a beat with \\"Hollywood Nights\\". Yes. She had all the right skills but, as ill-fate would strike him (often) he eventually woke up alone. As a side note- in all of Seger's songs he somehow always seems to create an infectious \\"groove\\". And having a talented creative band doesn't hurt either. Listen to \\"Still the Same\\" and you'll see what I mean. A girl that gambles - and Bob knows a relationship with her would be a gamble that he would lose. Inclusion here of those backup female voices. The song oozes like sweet syrup.<br /><br />\\"Old Time Rock & Roll\\" fits the Seger sound like a glove. Not much else to say here except if you haven't heard it a copy of it will be sent out IMMEDIATELY to your igloo in the artic. \\"Till It Shines\\" is a nice groove ballad about rising up from the imposed chains we put on ourselves. Nice word imagery here. \\"Feel Like a Number\\" is a nice rocker that is Bob's ode not to be just another face in the crowd. \\"Ain't Got No Money\\" (sounds strangely like \\"The Fire Down Below\\". No?) is the classic Seger strut song. No one is better at this than him.<br /><br />I have already mentioned \\"We've Got Tonight\\", which I think is definitely the best ballad he's ever written. Then people, we get to one of Metamorpho's favorites \\"Brave Stranger\\". Sort of reminiscent of \\"Night Moves\\" subject matter. Listen to the piano, listen to the groove, listen to how the whole thing moves. We then have that stop and that soulful middle with the sax and those background singers. White soul extraordinaire. A joy, and then it moves upward, insistently, back into the main groove again. A wonderful tune. One that gets Metamopho's old blood cells moving once again<br /><br />Then the ending, \\"The Famous Final Scene\\" which, ironically is last and one that, sadly, conveys all the ingredients included in a breakup. Listen to the crying sax- listen to Seger's mournful, soft, yearning vocals. So fine. So very fine.<br /><br />In conclusion, this album has to be considered as one of his finest offerings - but, believe Metamorpho - there are many more. It is nice to see Mr. Seger out there recording again after such a long abscence. I asked my guides to \\"will\\" this to happen. After all, we missed that quality and had to have it in the 21st century. For all who like good rock- this is a must.<br /><br />Well- that's it. Now I can only hope that some kid comes around that will shovel me out of this snowy mess. Do you think he'll accept spiritual currency? It's like a savings bond. Takes time to mature.<br /><br />Anyway my people.

B000LC55F2|5.0|I went to see \\"The Prestige\\" in the theater with little to no clue of what it is about. OK, I admit it, Scarlett Johansson's co-starring in the film ignited my interest in seeing it. And I was pleasantly surprised by every possible aspect. The film boasts a spetacular a-list cast that serves its characters in the best possible way. I wasn't aware of the fact that the film is based on a novel, nontheless, the plot is intriguing, suspenseful and will keep you on the edge of your seat...I love the fact that it does not take place in modern times, but about a century ago; It provides the film with the right energy and vibe. I was happy to see it did well at the box-office, it deserves it! Don't miss out on this great film.
B000ESSTKQ|4.0|That's because Rhino is now owned by the WEA group and they don't support SACD. They could have used DVD-Audio instead, considering all the trouble they went to creating surround versions. The DTS 96/24 tracks are decent IF you have a newer 96/24 DTS decoder, otherwise you'll get 48/24 output. This same problem will plague the upcoming Genesis reissues as well, you'll only get the SACD layer if you buy the import and that means the videos will be PAL format.
B00005MCX0|2.0|I went through a big Hawkwind phase in the early 90s and remember the excitement and joy when this CD arrived at the local mall from being specially ordered (This was before the internet was big, and odd, weird, unpopular stuff had to be special ordered by phone or catalog)      On first listen, I was let down.  'You Shouldn't Do That' can be described as one of most atrocious instrumentals known to man.  It does start off cool enough with an eerie, trippy special effect intro simulating something taking off into space.  Then as soon as the saxophone kicks in, everything turns to crap!  It's one thing to know how to play the sax and quite another to just mindlessly blow into the stupid thing.  Anyways, when all the key instruments get introduced in the beginning and kind of work their way up into the main riff, it then sounds like the sax and guitar start vomiting on eachother, and then it repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats until they vomit on eachother again; then repeats a few more dozen times for a total of 15 painful minutes!!  At one point, everyone in the group seemed content to plunk out any old note which made the song barely listenable at all.  By then, the only musician holding this fiasco together was the drummer.  And the lyrics?  Why would you put non-sensical hippeeisms into a so called 'space rock' song?  I dont know.  Out of the 30 or 40 times I heard this song, I only sat through the WHOLE thing twice!!  Apologies to die-hard fans for slamming this track, but it really IS that bad and puts a big dent in the album considering its length.        Now that that atrocity is out of the way, on to the rest of the album- the other songs aren't really that bad and make for some interesting soundscape music.  'You're Only Dreaming' has a wonderful 'breath of fresh air' motif as a backing to it's graceful swirl of electrics.  'Master of the Universe' was the sinister heavy metal track about the all supreme being- the guitar chords to this are nice fat and distorted.  I do prefer this version to the 'Space Ritual' version because even though the Ritual's version is faster and heavier,  it repeats itself beyond all levels of tolerance.  'In Search of Space's' version seems slower but shorter and to the point at the same time.      'Adjust Me' is another exploration of atmosphere and fuzzed out electronics.  It conjures up images of an android assembly plant and one of them seems to malfunction beyond control: 'adjust me... adjust meee adjust meeeee  adjust meeeeeeeeeeee'.  Very cool.         'We took the Wrong Step Years Ago' and 'Children of the Sun' are very extremely well played acoustic works that draw beautiful, lush, vivid images.  I would say that mr. Brock fares better with the acoustic guitar than the electric.  He has very good rythm.        All in all, a decent early 70s space rock album save for the first 15 minute bowel movement.  It renders this album rather short but thankfully, the re-issue has bonus tracks to make up for this.
B00005UMFE|5.0|The group of films in this collection is so varied, it would be hard to be a real fan of one of the five and not really dislike one of the others. There's no common theme here, not even a time period. The films included are as follows:<br /><br />All Quiet on the Western Front (1929-1930) - A group of German schoolboys are encouraged to sign up to fight in World War I. Once they get to the front, they encounter the harsh realities of killing your fellow man up close. It's still a powerful film because it was made pre-code and there was much more freedom to use harsh symbolism than in films made after 1934. It really embodies the antiwar sentiment that was common between the world wars. (5/5)<br /><br />The Lost Weekend (1945) - This is another really great film. Great acting by Ray Milland as Don Birnam, an alcoholic writer whose brother pays his bills so he can go on drinking. After decades of movies making drunkenness look like great fun, this film showed just how low a man can sink when he really needs a drink. (5/5)<br /><br />The Sting (1973) - This was a different kind of film to win the Best Picture award. It seems like it should be a film noir, since it is about revenge for a grifter buddy murdered by a mobster, but the mood of the film is actually rather playful. (5/5)<br /><br />The Deer Hunter (1978) - This is a great film about the effect of the Vietnam war on three friends from Pennsylvania. It is effectively a war movie without a war. The focus is more on what happens before and after the three experience what happens in Vietnam than what happens during their time in the military. (5/5).<br /><br />Out of Africa (1985) - This is one of those slow beautiful-to-behold but impossible-to-watch kind of movies that the Academy honors every now and then. I've sat through it exactly once, just so I could honestly say I had given it a chance, but I really found it insufferably boring. It's supposed to be based on the life of storyteller Isak Dineson, who lived in Africa from 1913 until 1931 running a coffee farm, and her love for a man that wants to keep his freedom. (3/5)...And I consider myself an easy grader.<br /><br />If you average the ratings of the movies together, you get 4.6/5, so I round up the score to 5 stars. You basically have four excellent films in this pack and one pseudo-dud. However, your mileage may vary depending on your taste in film. It's a good value if you are trying to collect the Best Picture winners on DVD and you can find it for under sixty dollars, plus its content doesn't overlap with the other Best Picture boxed sets. Overall, highly recommended.coffee farm, and her love for a man that wants to keep his freedom. (3/5)...And I consider myself an easy grader.

B000MNP2KI|3.0|Daniel Craig is a good action hero, but he is NO BOND, JAMES BOND<br /><br />I love the original Connery Bond. watched the Saint as Bond Roger Moore as Bond,Sat thru Dalton as Bond, Even like Brosnan as Remming Steele..er Bond. Each kept a lighter air with Bond<br /><br />For all who have an opinion, we all have our likes and dislikes. This film, in my opinion, is anti Bond formula. Bond , over the years, has been a superhero without a cape. A light action film peppered with throw away one liners and non bloody action.Yes, the villians are cardboard cutouts...with names like Jaws and Oddjob. Joke (like from Diamonds are forever) My name is Plenty..and Bond reply \\"Of course you are\\" are standard.<br /><br />This film broke the BOND formula, I did not conside it as a BOND film..it is too violent and disjointed for my tastes. Some many say it works better, I say it doesn't.<br /><br />Craig's Bond is heavy on violence and action with limited gimmicks you would expect in a 007 film. The story is a prequal of how Bond became Bond.<br /><br />This is a trumpth of those fan's of the Flemming works. It kept the updating lessen and akin to the Flemming story.<br /><br />I don't know if it was the film's dark hues that turned me off..or just Craig's mummblings<br /><br />As an action film, it is worth getting.. as a BOND, I have my reservations<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
0156907399|5.0|Written nearly one hundred years ago, this book is more distant from today's reader than the great Lighthouse may have been to the inhabitant's of Woolf's village island.<br /><br />Centering on a large and dysfunctionally polite family, the book has three very different parts: first when the majority of the family is still young; second when certain life-changing events occur to members of the that family; and last a trek to the Lighthouse by a few members of the family - a trek which was the subject of disdain and scorn between father and son in the first part.<br /><br />Written with an almost ADHD style - where comments of the events are interwoven with the thoughts of characters, and at times the two interwoven with dialogue -- the book shifts and turns and rocks, much like the sailboats of the island's denizens. This makes the book unique, and I warn readers that it also makes the reading more difficult.<br /><br />This is deemed a classic - but it is not a classic for the story, but rather for the prose and narrative form.  You read this to honor the writer, not to honor the story created by the writer.<br /><br />If you wish to read a great writer's greatest novel, try this. If you like this, follow  with [[ASIN:1441492291 Mrs. Dalloway]]. And, if you like each, read Cunningham's [[ASIN:0312243022 The Hours]], which seeks to honor Woolf as a writer by copying much of her style while incorporating much of her life with her stories.
B0000027RL|5.0|Let me just say that for all the anti-mainstream attitude and alternative music hype of the nineties it is amazing how much the mainstream grunge attitude affected people's opinion of what is and what isn't good music - based merely on image and attitude - something that, ironically, was supposed to not matter...<br /><br />That said, Pearly Jam's debut was an amazing musical achievement which even today stands apart from most band's current releases. LISTEN TO THE DAMN MUSIC!!! I was and still am a huge Nirvana fan, but who cares if Kurt Cobain had a negative opinion of Eddie Vedder or whatever...Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament had been in 'grunge' bands since the the mid-80's (Green RIver, Mother Love Bone, Temple of the Dog) and by the time Pearl Jam formed the guys had fine-tuned their musical abilities and were ready to create a masterpiece in ROCK MUSIC!!!<br /><br />Yes, that is right - ROCK MUSIC! This album has some of the best guitar rhythms and epic solos ever written! Although 'Alive' was definitely overplayed on the radio (and probably still is - I don't listen to the radio so I don't know) the last 2 minutes of the song is one of the best guitar solos ever! Fans of bands such as Led Zeppelin, Derek and the Dominos, or Deep Purple should rejoice over this kind of music. Ever wonder why so many people copied Eddie Vedder's singing style? - because his vocals are truly unmatched, full of angst and diversity. I love the long yells, fluctuations, and the way he utilizes his voice to express the emotion of each song - beautifully executed and probably one of the best vocal performances of any rock album.<br /><br />The grooves of 'Even Flow', the moving 'Black', and the lesser known epics such as 'Release' are easily some of the most unique and moving musical compositions, not just of the nineties era, but ever! That is quite a lofty claim, but I seriously cannot ever get sick of this album - and I was one of the nineties kid's with attitude who hated Pearl Jam at first, but I quickly became a fan of the music instead of the hype.<br /><br />'Ten' is an essential to any music collection...timeless...a true masterpiece.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: If you are looking for some of the best nineties rock then Alice in Chains 'Facelift' and 'Dirt' are also essential to your music collection. Alice in Chains were another band that was labeled 'grunge' by the media despite creating truly unique and awesome rock music.became a fan of the music instead of the hype.

0767817486|4.0|This was a very good movie to see, even though it was made some time ago. I really enjoyed how survival became the force which gave this person the will to continue, not loose focus on his goal but to escape. If someone is looking to see a true story that will scare you straight, this might be the one to see.I hope who ever watches this movie from my review, that you enjoy this story as much as I did.
B00005V1Y0|2.0|I saw the number of stars and thought I had purchased a great movie, but I did not enjoy it because it was old and seemed second rate. <br />Sorry!
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Unlike her first 2 albums which were pretty light and breezy, Norah Jones has something to say with her new album.  In one song, she sings she is ashamed a \\"deranged\\" man has been elected President.  In another song, she compares Bush to a captain who has drifted off course and refuses to admit that his ship is sinking.  Has Norah learned anything from the Dixie Chicks?  One song applauds her freedom of speech rights.  We will see if the radio stations agree.
B000002J1L|3.0|Genesis, in the Gabriel era, is one of my favorite band, I have once regard this album as a masterpiece. But time has passed and hearing it again shows that the album has not stand the test of time.  I have listen in the same afternoon Nursery Cryme, followed by Yes \\"Close to the Edge\\" and it clearly show to me that Close to the Edge is a prime example of an album that passed the test of time, but Nursery fails. Still a good album but not an album that I will listen often in the future.
B000000HSU|5.0|This is the definitive hardcore album. Bad Brains were among those who invented hardcore and they definitely set the ledge almost too high. This album is their best, IMO. It's almost incredible how tight the music is...
B000002J1M|4.0|I am a Genesis fan, Gabriel era fan since thirty years, of course this album is a must have and a classic of prog music, but like I said in my review of Nursery Cryme, this album also didn't passes the test of time.  Oh sure, there is Supper's Ready and Watcher of the skies, but listen again to Time Table or Get 'em out by Friday and see how these cuts are not well constructed songs as Genesis uses to composed.  I am rating it four stars mostly for Supper's Ready. Still a must have album, but I won't listen to it very often, it sounds too dated in my opinion.
B000065PUE|5.0|Incredibe album by an incredible band. It's equal parts abrasive, weird and catchy. And yes, all of those things are good. Great, actually. The harmonies, the melodies... Debaser... Tame...No.13...Here Comes Your Man...all brilliant. Especially Here Comes Your Man, which is pop and nevertheless amazing, I dare you not to hum along...
B000IU3XTM|4.0|The album is made by songs beautifully linked together. Even if used to Damien Rice's exceptional voice and way of making music, it took me a while to really appreciate the beauty of some of the songs. 'Elephant' is a pearl and 'Accidental babies' is, for now, definitely one of the most poignant songs I ever heard. Pure poetry.
B000000I0G|5.0|Born in 85 i wasn't really able to enjoy this music at it's peak, howeve my mom had it on lp and it rocked the house and as i got older i thought that i just have to get this on cd and i was right the whole cd is spectacular my favorite track is of course the 25 minute Taurus II followed by Family man and of course Five Miles Out
B000IHY9SE|1.0|and yes i have heard many k-fed songs.  not saying i'm a fan.  i know he's vanilla ice, part 2, but you know what?  eminem is far more pathetic, not as good of a rapper, and NOWHERE NEAR as entertaining (hey, even if you're laughing at k-fed's lyrics, it's still entertainment!)  sure, eminem was cool at first, when he first came out with those songs like \\"brain damage,\\" \\"kim,\\" and \\"my name is\\" but my GOD has he ever lost everything that made him remotely special.  just listen to his lyrics, he only knows how to rhyme the same syllable over and over.  even i can do that.  \\"yo, check out my rhyme, you know it's about time, i'm comin' at ya with crime, about to do it two times, about to erase ya'll slime, now pass me the dime.\\"  that's off the top of my head, not in an expensive studio and with plenty of time like eminem has, hahaha.  all he has going for him now is that he's white, so a lot of white kids like him.  it's truly pathetic.  then he has the nerve to call other people the \\"p\\" word.  keep in mind this is a guy who couldn't handle touring so he became addicted to sleeping pills, was dumped by MARIAH CAREY (yeah, he hates pop music, sure) and couldn't get over it, can't get over that stupid ho kim, and got his feelings hurt BY A SOCK PUPPET OF A DOG.  yeah, he's hardcore alright!!  lmao..  check out how he surrounds himself with tough black guys to make himself look tough.  the first track features a gun shooting sound over and over.  yet this is the guy who's never shot anyone in his life, he just pulled out a gun, got arrested and it scared him straight.  so then shouldn't he be singing about how violence his bad, especially with his friend recently dying by violence?   eminem has nothing important to say and his act is beyond old and tired now.      and i've got a question for you guys.  why does eminem keep saying \\"i'm back!\\"  WHEN HE NEVER GOES AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE?
B0002DB50E|5.0|Videodrome is a sort of look at virtual reality but not in the way you would expect.. It is more of a look at perception and the drug like manifestations of technology on the mind.. One of Cronenbergs best and most startling movies - 'videodrome' will have you very wary of computers, television, and technology long after you thought you shook away the Kafka like anxiety of modern times.. Who knows maybe we are the victims of a similar plot (we really wouldn't know it if we were would we?).. All of Cronenberg's movies confront some aspect of hallucination and perception - making them almost abstract in their significance.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie was artfully done. They made some NECESSARY changes to the book and they were for the better. the acting and casting were excellent. It really made me feel like I was in the book, at Hogwarts. The extra disc was reallly fun. All in all, a great tribute to a great book!
B0000A118M|5.0|This music goes straight to the marrow of existence.. It vibrates with the love and conviction of a man who has been enlightened. I do not wish to sound preachy or religous.. Coltrane, to put it into more matter of terms, was taking music to its most basic elements.. This is a classic among classics - it is not jazz- it is Coltrane.. It is not bebop - it is Coltrane..
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I really enjoyed this release. Brings back memories of 80's Maiden. True Maiden fans will like it. If you don't then just take a hike.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Although dated sets detract somewhat the overall effect is splendid.  A must have in any collection.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|I love Norah Jones. And the couple of songs she did write on her previous albums were actually pretty good. With this album she writes or co-writes all the songs. And frankly, the melodies are such a disappointment. That's the hook that grabs me and pulls me in to her music and it is just not there on this album.  I listened to this cd over and over. Gave it a rest and then came back to it hoping, praying it would jump off the player at me, and nothing. I was very hopefull for her songwriting and was wishing her all the best, but this one goes to the bottom of the stack for me.
0743454537|5.0|It's actually quite difficult to describe how perfectly Jodi Picoult handled such a complex and sensitive issue (of genetic modification and creating life solely for the survival of another life) as she did in her novel, \\"My Sister's Keeper\\". This book is delightfully sensitive, emotional and real. One is pulled into Anna's world from the very first page. It's a world where everyone seems to be a villain and a victim at the same time, so it becomes increasingly difficult to take sides. Where everything is wrong but for all the right reasons. It's a heartbreaking story that everyone should read so that they can take a look at their own life and perhaps... learn to be thankful.
031286504X|5.0|\\"I am Legend\\" is a remarkable novel that tackles vampirism with science-fiction, as opposed to the horror genre.  There are scary moments, but the thing that sets this novel apart is the scientific explanation that the main character, Robert Neville, gives for the plague of vampires that have taken over the world.<br /><br />The premise of this novel is that Robert Neville is the only man on Earth who is immune to the vampire virus.  The majority of the book follows Neville around as he goes about his daily routines in a post-apocalyptic world.  By all means, the beginning of this book should have been boring--but it wasn't.  Matheson's narrative and exposition bleed together as we discover the causes and effects of the germ 'vampiris' with Neville.<br /><br />This book is definitely one that gets you thinking about a lot of things; routine, the way a lonely mind changes and hardens, good/evil, and love/attachment.<br /><br />Nevermind Harker's journals, Helsing's tedious explanations, and the card-board cut-out Count Dracula.  This is the vampire novel that allowed for today's vampire genre to blow up.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.
B000AP2ZLC|4.0|I'm a lord worm fan to the grave.  I was so happy to hear that he was coming back and he didn't dissapoint me.  Granted, he doesn't do very much low growling but his mids and highs are still in tact.  You've got to keep in mind these guys are almost 40 years old!  Flo breaks down walls with his drumming here. My friend (a drummer) and I have been trying to figure out hot he does the fast snare work in Carrionshine all while hitting symbols.  It's mind boggling!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|The movie is an excellent mix of comedy and tragedy with symbols of hystory, memories and responsibilities to ourselves.  Those who understand Russian will appreciate the intricacies of the plot even more.  For example, the Grandpa not just says, \\"Jew\\" he is actually using a derogatory term \\"jid\\" which is an equivalent to \\"n-word\\" for blacks.  If you understand his anti-Semitic language, then in his first flashback to the war time ,it become unclear who is the executed and who is the executor, you may think that he was the one in the Nazis uniform...  The movie is full of symbols: the house in the middle of the sunflower field is a powerful symbol of living outside of reality and history,\\"Is war over?\\".
B00005JPDS|4.0|PROSITIVES:  This heartwarming film, based on true life, once again exalts the American Dream that anything is possible with a little luck and a lot of hard work.  All African Americans should watch this film.  Here is the depiction of an African American hero who refuses to give up, even when the odds are hopelessly against him.  All those who are facing major life setbacks should also watch this film.  This film offers more than entertainment.  This film offers encouragement to carry on.  All those who struggle with family relationships should see this film.  This film shows a love between a father and son that weathers the storms of life.  This film encourages family members to hold on a little longer.  Anyone not yet mentioned should see this film.  This film is one of those rare works of art that has the potential to improve society.  Will Smith does an excellent job in his role as Chris Gardner.<br /><br />NEGATIVES:  I only gave this film four stars because it begins to get a little slow about 2/3 of the way through and the conclusion is predictable.  The film's media publicity probably brought a few more people to the film, but gave away too much of the plot.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|It seems that on her newest album \\"Not Too Late,\\" Norah Jones, the sultry jazz/blues vocalist and piano prodigy refocuses her creative energies back on her music roots.<br /><br />The album, which is much more reminiscent of the works featured on her multi-Grammy winning debut, \\"Come Away With Me\\" than her highly anticipated follow up, \\"Feels Like Home,\\" is quite good.<br /><br />There are a few truly outstanding tracks with the signature smooth, smoky, sultry Jones sound her fans have come to know and love. Some feature a slightly upbeat sound with maybe even a little hint of a country music influence.<br /><br />Overall, the best songs on this album are probably, \\"Thinking About You\\" and \\"Until The End\\" both closely followed by the tracks \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" and \\"Wish I Could.\\" Then there are several tracks that fit into the categories of either better than average or mediocre. The only two songs that really seemed to leave something to be desired where \\"Sinkin Soon\\" and \\"Little Room\\".<br /><br />I rate all of the tracks as follows:<br /><br />Wish I Could - 4/5<br /><br />Sinkin Soon - 2.5/5<br /><br />The Sun Doesn't Like You - 3.5/5<br /><br />Until The End - 4.5/5<br /><br />Not My Friend - 3/5<br /><br />Thinking About You - 4.5/5<br /><br />Broken - 3/5<br /><br />My Dear Country - 3.5/5<br /><br />Wake Me Up - 3.5/5<br /><br />Be My Somebody - 3.5/5<br /><br />Little Room - 2.5/5<br /><br />Rosie's Lullaby - 4/5<br /><br />Not Too Late - 3.5/5<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is another solid work by an extremely talented artist. I'd rate it a 4/5 or B overall and would recommend it to fans of Jones' prior albums as well as anyone interested in going through an excellent jazz and blues style listening experience.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" the most powerful film ever made about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, returns to DVD in this epic 2-Disc Definitive Edition! The film is presented with fantastic sound and picture quality. As with the previous DVD release, the viewer has the option to view the film without subtitles, the way Gibson originally intended. Also included from the previous DVD release is the audio track for the hearing impaired.<br /><br />Among the plethora of extras is the 2005 release \\"The Passion Recut,\\" a shorter and less intense version of the film. Although good, it lacks the power of the full-length cut. The first disc also features four commentary tracks with Mel Gibson, the crew, and noted theologians.<br /><br />Disc two features the documentary \\"By His Wounds, We are Healed,\\" an outstanding in-depth look at the making of this monumental film. Also featured are five featurettes that take a look at the historical and theological context of the film's message. Rounding out the extras are some interesting deleted scenes, trailers, and production images.<br /><br />For fans of the film, this is a truly fantastic DVD release for Gibson's masterpiece! I highy recommend it! Even if you own the original release, the Defintive Edition is worth owning as well!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+
0679745203|5.0|Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's THE  ENGLISH PATIENT is a sweeping novel of memorable characters wounded by the onslaught of World War II.  At the core of the novel is the consuming affair between a mysterious archaeologist/adventurer of indeterminate European origin (unknown to the reader until the final chapters) and the wife of a British spy in North Africa.  A Canadian Army nurse, a thumbless Italian thief, Indian bomb expert and other Brits have their stories  unraveled as well as the English patient is tended by the nurse in the ruins of an Italian villa.<br /><br />Ondaatje's writing is lovely and haunting, the characters are complex and the plot fascinates.  Valentine's Day TIP: Present your literate love with a copy of this Booker Prize-winning novel and follow it up with a video rental of the equally enthralling Academy Award-winning movie of the same name.
0743556003|2.0|I drive almost 2 hours a day, so I usually alternate between reading the text and listening to the unabridged audio book. After 7 discs, I abandoned Lisey's Story back at the library.  May Lisey forgive this reviewer for dying on her, but then again, she isn't real. I rarely give up on a book, especially by a serious author, but almost half-way was enough. <br /> <br />Many readers looked forward, eagerly, maybe cautiously, to this novel. Here was the promise that Mr. King would add a layer of venturesome language to his blood-sure gift for mixing the painful and the mundane realities of living with impending horror and suspense. In his greatest works, similar to Hitchcock, it's what you don't see, it's what you fear that delivers the eventually big jolts, making them organically plausible.  <br /> <br />I wish the author had let his book On Writing guide this valiant attempt. Don't explain, just tell your story, let your use of words heighten emotion, alter the tone to keep the reader off guard, and tease by revealing incrementally only half the story at a time.  Stephen King needed to trust his readers to get the point, by allowing Lisey to act without repeatedly overexplaining herself. He was too seduced by D.H. Lawrence, whom he quotes in the book.   Lawrence's major flaw was overexplaining everything, unable to summon the courage to let his character's sexually brave acts stand alone.  <br /> <br />Yes, we get the point that there are dark and light sides and ambivalence at the heart of loving relationships. That mourning one's spouse takes a haunted and winding course. That the widow Lisey is threatened by the real world and her husbands netherworld. One can detect King's playing with word sounds but this is a beginner's exercise.  <br /> <br />There is rarely more than one tone coming from King's \\"radio\\" for the first half of the book, with repetitive meandering obsessiveness within a five note scale. Lisey's obsessions are ceaselessly identical, ornamented by phrases that recall the \\"cute\\" but stereotypical conversations and endearments traded with her husband. Repeat them too much they lose their mystery and power and become annoying.  It's like watching a couple take the first dance at their wedding: lovely at first but almost too private, so you tentatively turn away and sneak glances, but eventually let them have their intimate moment. At a wedding, you don't expect a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers romp.  That dancing duo invite you vicariously and in the safety of a crowd to relish your sense of sex, intimacy and play. <br />  <br />You are let down by King's inability to give you some Astaire and Rogers.  For example if Scott is such a deftly brilliant prize-winning writer, why is his personal language so repetitively trite?  How many times must one hear Lisey trod all over Maine using the same compass words: boul, strap it on, purple, and so on. In a great novel, language should unrelentlessly transcend the ordinary.  Mr. King's attempts don't succeed except for Scott's college library groundbreaking nightmare and Lisey's confrontation of the professor.  These well-written passages are separated by miles of Lisey's endless first-gear soliloquy. Mare Winningham, the reader, is an excellent actress, but she eventually succumbs to this deadening narrative.  <br /> <br />It just wasn't worth taking the rest of the ride. Sure there will be more blood. Scott will reach from the grave. The plodding narrative doesn't enhance any mystery.  It makes the reader lose patience, realize the inevitable storyline.  There's not enough payoff.  Joan Didion's non-fiction description of the death of her husband and her's daughter's illness, The Year of Magical Thinking, masterfully condenses mundane thinking and makes one appreciate the true creative spirit of her family. <br /> <br />I hope Mr. King to keeps working on it.  He's getting somewhere, but along the way he drove too carefully on the road trying to master the magic of words and neglected one of his hard-won gifts that typify his best work: how to keep his readers on a thrill ride, once he's cranked the engine.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Really great.  Sean Connery plays an agoraphobic recluse-writer a la J.D. Salinger who has been holing up in his seventh-floor apartment in the Bronx and living off the royalties from his sole novel, a Pulitzer Prize-winner.  This enables him to have a publisher lackey deliver food, Scotch and other items to his apartment.  He is also an avid birdwatcher with binoculars, which he also uses to watch local youths playing basketball in front of their public housing apartment towers.<br /><br />One of the kids, Jamal, sneaks into his apartment on a dare from the other guys and leaves behind his backpack, containing the journals in which he has secretly been writing.  Connery dumps the backpack<br /><br />out of the window, containing his red pencilled teacherly corrections<br /><br />(\\"Constipated writing!\\") and a mentoring relationship on both sides ensues.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this 2000 movie, rent it and I think you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />It's rated PG-13 for some bad language and two scenes where Jamal endures<br /><br />loud lovemaking sounds from the neighbors through his paper-thin apartment walls, but otherwise a great family movie to watch with older kids.
630522577X|5.0|Crystal clear and brilliant colors. Just what I hoped to get. A wonderful piece of work.
B000AGTPUU|4.0|fully animated and I think the Chronicles of Narnia may have been better fully animated or at least the Narnia side of it would have underlined the difference between our world and Narnia. I loved the strong African American female lead in this one.  She is so confident! Tom Hanks as the conductor has a bit of a mean streak that I didnt like, I was expecting \\"good cheer\\" at Christmas.  I think the anxiety and disbelief comes out very well in the boy lead (also played by Tom Hanks I think).  He has been lied to far too often and he no longer believes luckily for him in his world Santa is still real wheras in ours the original Saint Nick is long dead. The boy who \\"knows everything\\" was a bit annoying.  It makes me sad to see people with knowledge portrayed as annoying.   Unusual but good for a change of pace.
B00005JPCY|5.0|My husband and I just came back from seeing DejaVu at the Dollar Theater. <br />We will be talking about it over many a dinner to come; talking about the little twists and possibilities and what could or would happen next or  <br />possibly, in a sequal. <br />It was a good time and a great way to spend an unstructured afternoon together. We will be buying the DVD as soon as it comes available.  Similar to the movies RUNNING AGAINST TIME and FREQUENCY - and, of course, more than a few STAR TREK episodes. <br />I love the subtle-and not-so-subtle - mind-tumbles of time travel.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the previous albums. But I decided to get it anyway. I'm SO glad I did! It's one of my favorites now! I love tracks 3, 10, and 12 best. I think it's great that Enigma can think up new and exciting music when they're so unique already! :)
B000002G7E|4.0|The Velvet Underground were always something different and special. The first album, even by today's standards, was pretty innovative and artistic, and the second album is the more shocking and more avant-garde of the two. It's also the least digestible VU album, as it's not as catchy as \\"Loaded,\\" melodic as the self-titled record, or as song-for-song standout-ish as the debut. Even today, this record is menacing and scary, and still pretty unique. It may take some time for you to appreciate, as it is certainly an acquired taste. <br /> <br />The tracks get even more detailed into drugs, particularly the likes of cocaine, in the first track. That's one of the greatest songs on this album, and while there's six songs, there is so much that's accomplished on here. I wish John Cale had sung on more VU songs. I thought he was a great vocalist, particularly on \\"Lady Godiva's Operation.\\" It is brilliant and worth owning \\"White Light\\" for this alone. It is such a beautiful song. <br /> <br />Although, on the other side of the spectrum is the infamous seventeen-minute jam-out track \\"Sister Ray,\\" which is kinda scary, and totally dark and sinister. This track can be seen as one that paved the way for goth and noise rock. It is actually pretty well done and even at its incredibly long length, I think it's just fine. Well performed. <br /> <br />As for the other three songs, they're a little bit interesting, even if not as noteworthy. The only one I'm not a really big fan of out of those is \\"The Gift,\\" which goes the entire time through a poetic spoken word verses. I guess it's not bad, but not my type of thing. <br /> <br />This record is interesting, and if you're in for it, I totally would suggest getting this sophomore album from the Velvet Underground.
B000KQGP2G|4.0|\\"Be\\" was a pretty controversial albums, and I've no doubt that \\"Scarsick\\" will be one too.  This comes as no surprise, I guess, as Pain of Salvation is a legitimately progressive band, and any band that actually changes its sound is gonna alienate people continually.  Personally, I think this is probably their weakest album, and \\"Be\\" may well be their second weakest album, but this isn't necessarily representative of some sort of decline.  Not every album can be a bands best album, after all.  Besides, \\"Be\\" and \\"Scarsick\\" have different problems, so who knows where they'll go next.<br /><br />Though it's a weaker album overall, \\"Scarsick\\" repents of the grand sin that plagued \\"Be\\" which was, of course, concept album syndrome. (Which is when a concept album is so concerned with being a cohesive whole that it often fails to have real songs. \\"Be\\" had some fantastic songs, but a lotta nothing too.)  \\"Scarsick\\" is back to the straight one song after another format.  It's not one of their more proggy or technical albums, but they're still a lot more sophisticated than most bands, moving from rap-metal to vaguely punkish pop-rock to strange hard rock/techno hybrids to gloomy dirges and so on.  Most significantly, the whole key to Pain of Salvation's sound is still here: sophisticated songwriting and musical experimentation combined with a respect for melody and memorability.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the songwriting isn't as consistent as it has been.  \\"Mrs. Modern Mother Mary\\" is, to be blunt, a complete waste of time, and prevents this album from getting a 4 1/2.  Its consists of one tedious, repetitive riff which is played for four consecutive minutes while Gildenlow does a lot of showy, overproduced vox that never get within a mile of a decent melody all as the keyboards twiddle about a bit.  It is a spectacularly boring song.  \\"America\\" is also fairly dubious.  It's trying to be all ironically peppy, but it's mostly just grating.  Not a terrible song, but I couldn't say liked it either.<br /><br />Those aside, there is some really good material on this album.  We open with two rap-metal songs, both excellent.  Pain of Salvation have flirted with rappy stuff before, they really go all out here.  Pain... prove that it isn't that rap-metal is that terrible of an idea, but that most rap-metal bands are terrible musicians/songwriters.  Gildenlow raps surprisingly well, the instrumentation is solid and they can be quite effectively anthemic.  (Particularly the last few minutes of the title track, which just rocks like all hell.)  \\"Cribcaged\\" is a weird one, a slightly bluesy, profanity laced ballad.  Not one of the better tracks, but it's interesting.  \\"Disco Queen\\" didn't impress me much at first, but now I think it's awesome.  The_Wickerman called it progressive disco, and I guess that's as good a title as any.  The chorus is fun but I especially love the slow build of the verses with their repeating, eerie guitars and boards, the fluid, rumbling bass and Gildenlow's smooth but dangerous vocals.  Lotsa people will hate this song, I'm sure, but I think it's great, at least as a one shot deal.<br /><br />The second half of the album is perhaps less experimental, with three slow-building, dirgey epics.  \\"Idiocracy\\" is the best of them, with a great roaring climax, while \\"Kingdom of Loss\\" is more delicate and the closer \\"Enter Rain\\" the most epic and dreary.  All good songs, though they're a bit close together, particularly after you skip past the worthless \\"Mrs. Modern Mother Mary\\".  \\"Flame to the Moth\\" is the best song on the latter half of the album.  It's representative of Pain of Salvation at their best: intense, intricate guitarwork combined with great melody lines and harmonies and tons of energy and emotion.  Just a great song, and the emotional high point of the album, even if it can't match prior high points like \\"The Perfect Element\\", \\"Beyond the Pale\\", \\"Nightmist\\" etc.<br /><br />On an unimportant note, the lyrics on this album suck.  I was expecting a lot of fashionable anti-Americanism, but I mostly got a lot of maggot-brained primitivism and anti-capitalist sentiment.  The world according to Gildenlow:  Everyone in the US is miserable (Danny knows this for a fact, apparently) and this is all because of capitalism (another fact, apparently).  The poor are sad cause they don't own all the things the rich and middle class people have and those people are sad because of all the things they do own, oddly enough.  And worst of all, it's the plants and bunnies and mountains who really have to suffer.  Gildenlow also spends a lot of time ranting against conspicuously-consuming rappers.  He apparently watched an entire marathon of \\"Cribs\\" and it really pissed him off.  I've done the same thing, but I don't think I'd write a song about it. The lyrics are most comical, however, on \\"Kingdom of Loss\\" where Gildenlow whines about efficiency, elevators, stairmasters and fast food, all sources of our capitalist ennui.  We'd all be a lot happier if we just took the time to go eat at Denny's and got a nice Grand Slam, so says Danny.  Maybe an Eggs over My Hammy.  Interesting theories, though, but Gildenlow never addresses the question, \\"If not this, then what?\\".  Maybe he's saving that for Part 3. The stupid lyrics don't really affect my enjoyment of the album, but I'm damn well gonna make fun of 'em in this review.<br /><br />Guess I'm done.

0807262013|5.0|In my reviews of this trilogy of CD's, I'm of the opinion that it would be better to first read them before listening to them. I find that my imagination creates such a densely detailed world through reading than listening to the story. In addition, if it has been awhile since I've last listened I always have to back up a bit to catch on.<br /><br />Be that as it may, this is a stunning collection made all the more valuable by the peformance of the author rather than a 3rd party. I do become too distracted listening to the story while I am driving, so I save it for quiet evenings at home.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|If you don't know who Jesse Ed Davis was...this DVD is the perfect historical record to introduce you to one of America's and rock's under rated and vastly ignored blues guitarists.  Davis was a Kiowa/Comanche Indian from Oklahoma who rose from obscurity to standing on stage at this concert with Harrison, Dylan, Clapton, and Russell among others.  Davis had backed up Russell, Taj Mahal, as well as releasing three solo albums.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to speak with Davis in 78' at a benefit concert he performed at for the Denver Indian Center.  He was a great guy, humble, and still an 'Indian' in his one on one meetings with other Indians.<br /><br />Besides the great footage and music on this great DVD, take the opportunity to meet Jesse Ed Davis, even if it's hard to discern his playing and  contributions to the concert.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Indeed as most reviewers note this film and story and cinematography is one of those unparalleled for overall brilliance in the portrayal of what is considered the plight of the common man in the throes of the dust bowl and depression popularized in modern music by Pete Seeger,Bruce Springsteen, Jack Kerouac in literature and the artistic expression of most anything labelled left-leaning from fashion to art.<br /><br />This movie has a sublime power because it easily juxtaposes and makes one take sides between the family and the individual,love and hate, exploitation and fairness, Capitalism or benevolent Federalism all renderd in classic black and white nuanced beauty.<br /><br />The film remains a tearjerker depicting Tom Joad and his family portrait of the the working poor and the disenfranchised farmer kicked off his land by carpetbaggers and bankers.Despite themes of exploitation and abuse it is possible to see the makings of an American epic and country in formation and development in which the movie pays it's homage.<br /><br />A needed movie to be viewed by all on this DVD with wonderful transfers and stills, extras include newsflashes,commentary on the film, making this a worthy purchase of a history making movie that depicts a side of American history of a forgotten people living faithfully in the pursuit of security and family values amidst rapid change and industrialization changing the face of the USA and the world forever.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|First off Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker did an excellent live performance on Their Albert Hall dvd, and this cd release has just knocked me off my feet with great sounding blues and rock instrumentation. Creams voices sound a little aged but incredibly and astonishingly clear, energetic for a bunch of sixty something year olds. I mean \\"where the hell have these three bloaks been\\"!! A few of these songs have been written by some old time blues artists like (Skip James, Willie Dixon, Arthur Reynolds, Muddy Waters, Aaron \\"T. Bone\\" Walker Gregmark, Booker T. Jones, Robert T. Johnson. Cream performed each of these old time blues songs with kid gloves and amazing percision. I'm sure these late blues artist were smiling from the pearly white gates of heaven at Creams amazing performance. Some of everyones old favorites are here \\"Sweet Wine\\" \\"I'm So Glad\\", \\"Politician\\", \\"Whiteroom\\", \\"Badge\\", \\"Crossraods\\", to \\"Toad\\" and of course \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\". 19 songs of pure rock and blues mix, including an alternate of \\"Sleepy Time Time\\". I was hesitant to buy this cd thinking \\"Big Deal another stupid boring live recording\\". Dead wrong as I was with the Cream Live At Albert Hall dvd this cd is an awesome compliment to the already famed \\"Cream Live At Albert Hall\\" dvd release. Man!!! I listen to this cd release and it is like I am going on an incredible audio joy ride. Cream has made alot of money with these concerts and cd-dvd releases, I will say, they gave their fans their monies worth. I hope Cream continues to make live performances in the near future, and maybe a brand new Cream recording. Highly recommended!!!!! To any naysayers of this cd release I respect your opinion, positive or negative, all I can say to these naysayers is, \\"this cd is an incredible audio experience\\"..............
B00003CX9E|5.0|Simply a classic and remains so.<br /><br />One of these epic films that is not meant to be entertaining but a catharsis with a lesson..<br /><br />When watching this film you know you are not watching some one's YouTube video but a serious work of art from soup to nuts that is a careful psychological profile of an unbalanced billionaire whose need for external attention and impressive riches of grandeur overshadows what he lacks..Love and a meaningful inner life.<br /><br />His need for power even under the guise of protecting the \\"common good\\" remains false and insincere and a mask of hype that money can buy success and renown yet in fact does not make up for his own lack of depth and purpose as all make clear to him in this difficult high art penetrating film.<br /><br />This extreme extrovert seeks it all on the 'outside\\" and his tumultuous lifestyle, loss of wives and friends,scandals,own peculiarities and eccentricities leaves this character a very lonely man in the dead cold as his world breaks down as he destroys all the external trappings of his wealth before breaking down seeking the security of Rosebud...a chair.<br /><br />No bought hype or elected office title and approval from others will help this pathetic soul forced to look into his own reflection.<br /><br />Is the American bravado and character parallel to this movie as critics often say? It seems that a one sided reliance on the trappings of wealth and power does not compensate for a happy existence as this film portrays.<br /><br />The DVD transfers are great and all the commentary and extras makes this a university course in 20th century film.
B000002ORU|5.0|Some reviewers look at this Who box set as a bitter disappoinment. I agree if you think this box set is mainly a greatest hits compilation. All \\"Thirty Years of Maximum R&B\\" is, is a biography of the Whos ledgendary career. Yes, their are five edited songs and some annoying Keith Moon stints and alternate takes of songs, some previously unreleased tracks, along with some Pete Townshend interviews. Yes, I agree with the bitterly disappointed Who Fans about these annoyances on this Who box set. I look at this set as a Who biography that you should listen to all four cds straight through to appreciate this cd box set as just a time travel through The Whos early years as the High Numbers to their mega magnum opuses like \\"Tommy\\",\\"Who's Next\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\" to \\"Who Are You\\" and to their lowlights \\"Saturday Nights Allright For Fighting\\" with Sir Elton John. I realize there are some bitter disappoinments on \\"Thirty Years of Maximum R&B\\" even the sound does'nt sound remastered. I believe MCA did a fine remastering job with this box set as most of the older 1960s Who tunes were recorded in mono. The thick booklet accompanying this Who box set is very informative and engaging literature to any Who fan or rock fan in general. You could go out and spend a ton of money on The Who Japanese import box set, I believe includes 16 or 19 Who studio Albums. I was going to save my money and do that, but I decided to buy most of The Who remastered Cds with the awesome literature booklets accompanying each cd. \\"Thirty Years of Maximum R&B\\" is not worth the list price by no means. I only own it because I found it for a great price on Amazon. If you could find \\"Thirty Years of Maximum R&B\\" for a cheap price it would be a nice addition to your Who cd collection. \\"Thirty Years of Maximum R&B\\" is a nice well thought out Who Biography with some bitter disappoinments but worth owning for the right price..........
1400049628|5.0|I am a huge zombie fan and like 90% of my dvds are some form of zombie movie.   about 2 years ago my girlfriend got me this book and i've since read it atleast 5 times.  it's written so seriously like it's a real survival guide, sometimes i get so into it I forget it's fake.   <br />i recommend to any and all zombie fans
B000EDZL9I|5.0|The author provides a detailed history of different sets of cryptology , starting thousands of years ago up until modern day. The chapter on the Navajo Indians during WWII is fascinating. The very detailed formulas and coding is attractive to anyone with an interest in the sequence of numbers and characters.
B000069CWE|1.0|This is your typical remix album, where a bunch of DJ's take a really good bunch of songs and mix, and mash them up until it sounds like crap. The original songs sounded so great, why mess with that? Also there's a lot of rapping on the album which isn't that great. I'm so tired of R&B hip hop rap, and there's plenty of it on this album.    There's one really good song, \\"My December\\", which is classic Linkin Park. They could have made a whole new album based on this song.    When's Linkin Park coming out with a new album?!
0743289412|2.0|Yes, Im yet another avid S.K fan, who will never give up on the master, despite being horribly dissappointed <br />in his two lastest offerings, firstly the mediocre 'Cell', and now the neverending Liseys story. <br />Why has King become so damn long winded?? His best novels have always been huge, but without a word to spare within an un-put-downable epic (eg Tommyknockers, IT, The Stand etc, etc) <br />Liseys story dragged on like a long, boring movie full of dull characters. There were the odd moments of vintage King, but they were few and far between. I almost gave up halfway through, as the use of the ridiculous word 'smuck' made me want to throw the book away! I also found it irritating that Boo ya Moon was merely a poor replica of 'The Territories' within the brilliant 'Tallisman' (co written with Peter Straub)  <br />I still have faith in King and will continue to read everything that he offers us.. fingers crossed he has another great novel in him to rival his spectacular back catalogue.
B000E1155O|5.0|Difficult to describe music with words so I won't even try. <br />People who like Leonard Cohen, Nico (\\"Chelsea girl\\"), Nick Drake, <br />Will Oldham, Sandy Denny, etc... should love this music.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|This is one reason why my wife and I don't go to the movies.  There just aren't any good movies produced.  But what shocked us the most was the use of the four-letter \\"F\\" work through out the movie.  Perhaps we are prudes, but what kind of a movie would subject a young girl to such language.  And the star didn't have much of a role, except perhaps the dance routine at the end of the show. <br />Don't waste your money!
0393327655|3.0|A few months ago, I left the Congregational Church because I was having increasing difficulty accepting the basic tenets of Christian faith. Since then, I have read a number of books on faith - most recently \\"The End of Faith\\" by Sam Harris.  From the beginning of this book, I was telling myself \\"Yes, that is how I feel.\\"<br /><br />After I finished the book, I reflected on the thoughts of Professor Robert Greg of Willamette University who addressed a seminar on the subject at the Congregational Church years ago. He said something to the effect that it is unclear whether God created man or man created God - but does it matter? His thesis was that perhaps man NEEDED faith in God.<br /><br />In summary, this book is sure to stimulate thought but its conclusions are debatable.<br /><br />Three stars because it wasn't, for me, an easy read.
B00005JPCD|5.0|First, the scenes with the leopard seal and whales trying to eat penguins may be too much for very young children, that said, those scenes are just a fraction of the movie.  That's why it is PG...you know your child and what they can handle.  This does a far better job than \\"Finding Nemo\\" at quickly lightening the mood after scary parts with comic relief.  My 6 year old daughter LOVES this movie!!!  It's visually breath taking, funny, smart, meaningful and well paced!  We've seen it 5 times, and she's always enthralled, where as with \\"Open Season\\" she was bored!  I've never heard any child in the theater complain, unlike \\"Curious George\\" where one kid said half way through the movie, \\"Is it over yet?\\"  It was uplifting and empowering, because the humans become the heroes, along with Mumble (once the humans realize that here is a problem).  The music is fantastic!...and it doesn't treat kids like they're stupid.  It teaches kids to think about the possible consequences to their actions, like carelessly dumping those plastic 6 pack rings and to be tolarate of the differences others, because not everyone has the same talents or skills (e.g. singing, dancing, etc.)...as the parent of a special needs child, I found that very heart warming!  BEST KIDS' MOVIE SINCE \\"BROTHER BEAR\\" in 2003!!!
B000000H42|5.0|God, I love Mercyful Fate. They are without a doubt one of the best and most influential black metal bands of the 80s along with Venom, Mayhem, and Celtic Frost. They also have hints of power and thrash metal in their sound as well. The band's second album 1984's \\"Don't Break the Oath\\" was the first MF album I ever bought, and it's an incredible follow up to their 1983 classic debut \\"Melissa\\" which I still need to get. This album is just loaded with Satanic lyrics which I don't even take seriously at all, but they will offend some, and of course the musicianship on here is just flat out amazing. This album was also my first listening experience of MF frontman the one and only King Diamond. This guy has without a doubt one of the most insane yet powerful set of vocals in metal, and on here he showcases his incredible vocal range with sheer power and intensity. His eerie falsetto like screams will just scare the crap out of any emo/screamo kid and even trick or treaters on halloween night. Hank Shermann and Michael Denner are very awesome guitarists who both have opposite guitar playing styles, but they blend together just so beautifully. Hank is more on the fast shredding side while Michael is more on the melodic playing side. Their awesome riffs and dualing leads and solos will definately take you through a ride through hell and back. Timmi Hansen has great bass lines you can actually hear, and there's also great drumming from Kim Ruzz as well.<br /><br />The songs and the ratings:<br /><br />1. A Dangerous Meeting - A great opening song and one of my favorites on here Great vocals from KD and killer solo from Denner BTW. 5/5<br /><br />2. Nightmare - A mid paced number which starts off with some nice bass lines from Timmi and some Motorhead esque drumming, and then shifts to mid tempo around the 2 minute mark. Great song. 5/5<br /><br />3. Desecration of Souls - Another one of my favorite songs on here. More great dualing solos from Shermann and Denner too. 5/5<br /><br />4. Night of the Unborn - 5/5<br /><br />5. The Oath - The longest song on the album clocking in at 7:31 if I'm not mistaken. This one is a killer track and the best one on here as well. The intro will definately send chill down your spine. Love the dualing solos. 10/5<br /><br />6. Gypsy - Another one of my favorite tracks. Very mid paced too. 5/5<br /><br />7. Welcome Princess of Hell - 5/5<br /><br />8. To One Far Away - Nice accoustic interlude with some electric guitar added leading into the final track. 4/5<br /><br />9.

B000KCHZK6|3.0|After blowing us away with her 6X Grammy Award winning album (2002's)\\"Come Away With Me\\" and (2004's) 10 million WW sold \\"Feels Like Home\\" Norah returns with her third effort \\"Not Too Late.\\"  While it still has some elements of her first two efforts, Norah seems to be heading in a different direction without completely changing her sound to keep her enormous fan base hanging around... <br /> <br />While the album is a complete, sophistcated one which is composed very nicely by songwriter/producer/boyfriend Lee Alexander and completely written/co-written by Norah Jones for the first time, it doesn't have that standout track or catchy hooks that have drawn fans from all genres in to take a listen...Infact it sounds as if Norah composed this record as if the only person she was trying to perform for was herself and her musical partners as it is a personal album but not as easy to like as her previous ones... <br /> <br />Saying that there are still a couple gems on this album that will make you hit the repeat button to listen to again...Opening track \\"Wish I Could\\" is a great song which sounds alot like a track from \\"Come Away With Me.\\"  \\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\" provides the first, and unfortunately only real singalong moment of the album, with the infectious chorus \\"Time won't pass us by and I won't tell you lies\\" sitting beautifully atop swiftly-plucked acoustic guitar rhythms. <br /> <br />I found it more appealing by following the lyrics while listening to the music as there is no denying Norah is a great pure lyricist but i just feel like on many tracks the composition was lacking... <br /> <br />Maybe im being a bit hard on Norah because i expected more but when you put out one of the best albums of the 21st century and follow it up with another piece as \\"Feels Like Home\\" this one just seems to be missing something... <br /> <br />
B000M341QE|5.0|I watch a lot of movies. With this one I saw in the trailer before it came out that this was going to be good. I love detective action movies. 16 blocks, Training Day, both good movies. But I've got to say that The Departed was the best movie I saw in the theater in the year 2006.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|Norah Jones has talent,but has settled for the Starbucks format of Music that fits into a certain segement which  for the most part just blares out at you,but none of the tracks are memorable. another well-Produced Album, but lacking big time in the sgonwriting department&Vocally Norah Jones is aight,but nothing ever stands out.  alot of this album sounds just like her previous two albums. formula is cool,but Norah Jones needs to be challenged a bit more.
B00062I6TO|5.0|This was the first Laser Disc. I purched in 1990. The DVD was much better than the Laser Disc. Since I do not have to turn the DVD the music is much more cohesive than the Laser Disc., Carlos Klieber was young then. He seemed more energetic than his later years. Recommend the DVD without any reservation for anyone who loves Klieber's style of conducting.

B000E1ZBH2|1.0|With the Colin Firth-Jennifer Ehle BBC version still fresh and available, why anyone thought that making an abridged theatrical version with anachronisms and insipid acting is beyond me. It's illiterate to confuse the srong-willed and unconventional Austen character of Elizabeth Bennet with a modern-day liberated feminist, which she was not and could not have been. The BBC version understood that; this version was silly and superficial, not to mention that there was no chemistry at all between the leading characters. The idea of Mr and Mrs Bennet as a loving couple is completely contrary to the original story. There was no presentation of the absolute necessity for a young woman with little money to have to marry well, and many other essentially interesting plot points were eliminated.  This Mr Darcy isn't haughty and rude, we're supposed to feel sorry for him because he's shy?  Films are different from novels, but if you're going to change the essentials of the story, you might as well update it entirely to the present day, and call it something else, but not Jane Austen's.
B000M5AJQ8|1.0|The movie is excellent. Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br />But the fact they released it on a combo format means I will not purchase it. I did not purchase an HD-DVD player so that I can buy an SD format of the movie. No, I take that back. So that I can pay MORE to have both versions. If I wanted both versions, I would buy them separately. <br /> <br />This has kept me from buying multiple movies now, and it's infuriating.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|I knew almost nothing about the film--I rented it on a recommendation from a friend. The story takes a long time to get going, but it is well worth the patience. It is quirky, often funny, and unpredictable,not a perfect film, but the story becomes compelling and the atmosphere very convincing and realistic. All is wrapped up a bit too neatly, but the performances are excellent
1860469590|4.0|Just as a point of trivia but in Europe and in Sweden, detective Kurt Wallander's home, the spelling is sometimes Wallender or Wallander, but usually Wallander. One encounters both spellings on amazon.<br /><br />I thank fellow reviewer Leonard Fleisig for bringing this author to my attention. The writing is simply superb, and I am very interested in reading more books by the same author. The story overall is not great and there are better books by the author. In addition to this book, I have read five other books in the Kurt Wallender series, including The Man Who Smiled, and One Step Behind.<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars. I thought that the story was sometimes slow and there were too many coincidences and unreal fights in the book. Wallender is more interesting when he is at home in Sweden and when there is more interaction with other policemen at the Ystad station. Here that element is almost lacking and that spoils the book, along with the many departures from reality. Also, the story follows the same Wallender formula which after three books is a bit too predictable: chapter one is a murder, and in a subsequent chapter a fellow policeman or friend of Wallender is murdered, dragging Wallender into the conflict.<br /><br />Most of the story is set in Riga, but the opening sections are set in southern Sweden in Wallender's home base of Ystad.<br /><br />I will not give away the plot and the essential plot elements are outlined by the publisher: two dead bodies wash up on the shore near Ystad in a rubber raft. A policeman arrives from Riga since the bodies are traced to that city. Wallender works on solving the crime in Sweden and then follows the crime to Riga.<br /><br />This is a fast read that I was able to read it in less than a day. I read it while staying at a hotel in southern Sweden, not too far from the crime scene; the details and descriptions of the places and other details are authentic.<br /><br />The writing is smooth and flawless, but the story pulls it down to 4 stars. One Step Behind is a better book in the series.a better book in the series.
B000I0QL82|4.0|Long overdue for restoration, so glad I could see something close to the original.  This was long one of my favorite musicals: the plot is aptly sentimental, Bing's crooning is right on the mark, and Astaire's dance numbers were spectacular, great showcases for his unequalled talent. What's unfortunate is the blatant racism in some of the plot and most especially in at least one of the holiday production numbers (Lincoln's Birthday.) Of course this film was made in a different and clearly unenlightened era, but even as a non-African American I find some of the scenes painful and embarrassing.  I still have to admit to the guilty pleasure of enjoying most of it.  This really was Astaire's showpiece.
0792165020|5.0|\\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" deserved to win \\"Best Picture\\" in 1999. That it didn't even receive a nomination when \\"The Green Mile\\" did was the latest in jaw-dropping Academy travesties--the most hideous being \\"Dances With Wolves\\" beating out \\"Goodfellas\\" for the top prize in 1990.<br /><br />This film is a masterpiece in every respect. Incredible, incredible acting from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jude Law (these two are standouts, but the other performances are also excellent). Beautiful cinematography in Italy. A gripping, complex story, and a thought-provoking exploration of class stratification and angst over sexual orientation amidst the rigid American societal norms of the 1950s. When I saw this movie, I thought to myself that film-lovers needn't yearn for decades long past: \\"Ripley\\" demonstrated that the golden age of American cinema is right now.<br /><br />Was it a case of mass delusion among Academy members that caused them to overlook this movie? I'm sure that history will prove that they were very wrong in 1999, just as it has shown that they were very wrong in 1990. How often does \\"Dances With Wolves\\" appear on any \\"Greatest Films\\" lists these days?
B0007TKNL0|3.0|An eye-filling, gorgeous, no-expenses-spared version of Andrew Lloyd Weber's musical. Many similarities in sets and sequences to the original stage play. It is still a bit stagey, but it has been opened up a bit. The three leads are beautiful in appearance and in voice--this Phantom is hardly disfigured in my opinion, which makes his hiding from the world a little less credible. This film is a feast for the eyes and ears.
B0002J4ZWS|2.0|The #2 best movie of all time? Are you kidding? \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" is formulaic, dumbed-down Hollywood treacle. The heavy-handed Morgan Freeman voice-overs right away indicate that you're in for two hours of safe, sentimental mass-appeal entertainment devoid of any irony or intelligence.<br /><br />The movie's depiction of gays (the \\"Harpies\\" in the prison) as violent rapists out to defile decent heterosexual men needlessly promotes dangerous stereotypes.<br /><br />\\"Shawshank\\" isn't a horrible movie. It's just a mediocre one that doesn't belong even near any \\"Best Movies of All Time\\" lists.
B00001QEE9|5.0|This particualr Disney animated film has a legendary score, with \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" nearly being the Disney anthem. Also, are many other fine songs to accompany a gorgeously detailed animation technique. Great for children, but just as well for adults who enjoy masterpiece animation at it's best.
B00005JMJG|3.0|Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet put in great performances in uncharacteristic roles. Carrey skillfully plays a character that is not, for once, a hyperactive, face-contorting caricature, while Winslet's American accent is perfect, and her character's neurotic, willfully unconventional persona is compelling.<br /><br />I realize that a movie like this requires one to suspend disbelief and accept a premise that is obviously impossible. But I found the depiction of a memory-erasing clinic and the blithe insensitivity that its staff exhibited towards its clients too ridiculous to get past. Fine, we know that mind-erasing services for the heartbroken are something that could never happen in real life, but why make this even more implausible by having the clinic offer holiday specials in the manner of K-Mart and perform its services with such utter lack of care--things that would be quite unlikely if such services were possible? Yes, the director is trying to show us that the practitioners at the clinic are essentially cold-hearted and indifferent to the love that its hapless clients--and, ostensibly, the viewers of the movie--feel for those close to them. This recalls the Spielberg bomb, \\"A.I.\\", where we're supposed to be indignant that a company could so callously market human-like robots like Barbie dolls while turning a blind eye to the robots' emotions and suffering.<br /><br />But in both cases, this attempted appeal to the audience's moral outrage falls flat. The films encourage us to righteously declare: \\"*We* would never try to erase the precious memories of loved ones! *We* would never mistreat robots if they had human feelings!\\" But nobody else would either, and the resulting nonsensical premise is an awkward distraction that is hard to look past, good acting or not.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Disney or not, this is simply Julie Andrews at her very best. Everytime I watch it, I keep thinking how much trouble Mr. Disney had to get the rights to film the project, plus his discovery of Julie in Broadway production of Camelot. They were ready to cast her, but were crossing their fingers for the outcome of the \\"screentest\\". Low and behold she took over the cinema screen with a \\"snap\\" of a finger.<br />Another comment I might add, is that some might look at the animation sequence as outdated by today's standards, but to follow the story at a closer level, the animation in this movie is about entering a drawn fantasy world via Mary Poppins. The drawing in the story is a pavement picture among many accomplished by an jack of all trades. He even apologizes for any shortcomings his drawings may have to the home audience in mild references. So, with that in mind, it would be out of character (if you will) to have the animation suddenly appear a phenomenal rendering by today's animation standards because in the story it has been drawn by an apologetic part-time artist. And with that, take a better look at that background forest and the architecture of the colorful bridges, they still leave many animators in the country dust!<br />Mary Poppins is, and always will be, Mr. Walt Disney's \\"crowning achievement\\". . . make no mistakes.

B00004R9A4|4.0|Forming a plan to fight the invading German troops during the war, Mrs. Price decides to embark on using her witch talents to succumb the army. Unfortunitely for her, she gets interrupted by becoming caretaker and provider for 3 children assigned to her home. As children so often do, they quickly discover her hidden talents, and intentions. And as children so often do, they decide to join her magical efforts. But she requires additional words to complete a working spell, and that leads all four of them to London on a magical riding bed, to seek the professor of her correspondence of witchcraft.<br />Full of songs, dance, grand special effects, animated underwater sequence, with bubbling score, and a knockout soccer match at animal island. Angela Lansbury is a grand witch matriarch, without being stiff or unbearable, she is really quite charming. Matched by her co-stars, and the children being unknown to me from many, if any Disney films, are able to be real children and not sugary sweet.

B0000524CY|3.0|When this movie first premiered at my local hometown theaters, way back when, I recall seeing the massive lines to get in. I stayed away. In the meantime, I began to read articles on how people seeing the movie were becoming possessed themselves, by upset stomachs, fainting, and leaving.<br />When it came time for me to see the movie on the big screen, I was holding on to my seat with remorseful anticipation during the blank screen pre-movie showing, back in the day when in between movies was not bombarded by ads. I was wrong, and even surprised. As often as this movie has been punned by flicks like Repossessed, and horribly redone by movies like Beyond The Door, this movie almost needed no unduly jabs. You either found it repulsive, scary, or just plain funny. I felt the latter.<br />Unfortunitely, I was a Monster magazine devout reader, and they pretty much went into many articles concerning how scary movies are made. When I watched this movie, I kept analyzing how it was done, so much so, I forgot the terror I was supposed to feel. I enjoyed it, but its Ellen Burstyn, as the traumatized mother, that makes this movie really click.<br />She is the springboard for major concern, while the other actors play off of her situation. This movie didn't scare me, but it was well made and I like the original version best. Too much subliminal messages are incorporated in the additional scene footages, and they distract.<br />Tubular Bells score is simply awesome, even now!
B000002KBU|4.0|Driving home in the wee hours from the Indy airport, there is no better accompaniment that Joni Mitchell on BLUE.<br /><br />Seldom are whimsy and reflection caught so well without damaging the wings.<br /><br />This CD is sparely orchestrated. Lots of Joni's own guitar and piano foot the bill. Her voice is very versatile, though she occasionally blemishes a song by forcing its limits.<br /><br />After all these years, she still tells an awesome story.
B00005JPDJ|5.0|This isn't just a chick flick.  My wife (of 34 years) and I have watched this in the theater twice.  Jude Law and Kate Winslet are absolutley wonderful.  If you like romance, this one is a must see!
B000148KK2|5.0|Good grief, Elvis Costello, you'd better treat this lady well.<br /><br />The room fills with rich smoke as Diana Krall sings, but it isn't the guy slouched in the corner with the Habano. It's what happens when Krall does this kind of singin'.<br /><br />She could wrap this voice around your neck like a phython. 'Good thing she's friendly.<br /><br />On THE GIRL IN THE OTHER ROOM, Krall sings across the repertoire of low-key, sultry tunes for piano in a jazz bar.  She never even touches campy.<br /><br />This is raw talent, brought to bear on great writing, with untouchable results.<br /><br />Jazz lovers, beware. You'll never stop with just one Diana Krall album.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I'm not one of those guys who hates the Richard Lester original, but even with what Richard Donner didn't get to shoot, this is a far superior film. This version has much more depth and feeling. It was good to see Marlon Brando again and Christopher Reeve in new footage. Any fan of this charatcer, these movies or big moviemaking in general should see this. It's a last look at where the Reeve/Superman franchise was at its zenith... before it all went wrong.
B00005JPCA|2.0|This can only be a low budget movie, as half the things that are synonymous with Bond movies are missing. <br />1) The opening theme to all James Bond movies <br />2) No Q <br />3) No Austin Martin or Jaguar with gadgets ( in actual fact James has to gamble to get his transportation) <br />4) Not a lot of girl's (previous James Bond's had at least 5 - 6 girls surrounding him) <br />5) No Specta <br /> <br />Why they used the James Bond title is beyond me, it seemed like any other thriller to me, and if had not been for the acting itself which was passable and the special effects which were good, I would have stopped watching it  <br />
B000002MTU|3.0|Clapton has not created any electric blues worthy of regard in 20 years. His voice was never anything, of high enough quality, or uniqueness, to make you get chills, or build a memory around. Today, in the 21st century, his voice is even less memorable. Maybe a quarter of a century ago, his guitar playing, could hide, his utterly, ordinary, voice, but he chooses, not to even attempt, the strong, string work, of days, \\"way\\" gone by. In addition as Shaq, \\"The King Of The World Blues Reviewer\\", always says: \\"You can't get the blues, in 2-4 minutes!\\" To save you getting a calculator: There are 16 songs totaling 60 minutes on this CD. 12 OUT OF THE 16 SONGS ARE 4 MINUTES OR UNDER! For anyone who really knows, and understands, the greatness of the electric blues, genre, would know this is a mediocre CD at best!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|For those of us who passionately love literature and feel completely loyal to an author's account of a story, it is always with a wary eye that we watch film adaptations. I have happily resigned myself to the fact that a film rarely, if ever, fulfills my precise expectations by doing a book absolute justice. The important thing to remember is that each individual- each reader- has his or her own unique experience of any novel, and each interpretation (is not only precious to us, but) is vulnerable to being subjective and biased in some way.  <br />That being stated- as a disclaimer of sorts- I must admit to enjoying what this particular film rendition of Charlotte Brontë's dazzling novel had to offer. If you, as a viewer and not a critic, soak in the atmosphere of this film, you are sure to get something entertaining and relatively delightful from it.  <br />In keeping with the opinion of several other reviewers, I appreciated the way in which the relationship between Rochester and Eyre was showcased. It was refreshing to watch the two actors interact and develop their relationship throughout the two installments. I particularly reveled in scenes which called for Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson to share more playful, jocular moments. I remember loving sections in the book which alluded to the witty repartee that united Jane and Rochester's characters.  <br />Of course, I had been anticipating the garden scene, in which Jane and Rochester confess their affection for one another...and I was surprised to be slightly disappointed! I recall that scene being extremely erotic and dark. Jane was wandering the garden at night, teased by imagining Rochester's presence (she kept catching a whiff of his clove-scented cigaret). Little did Jane know that Rochester was following her every move, puffing on his cigaret and waiting for his opportunity to urge Jane to confess her feelings. It was an incredible scene- heavy with sensory descriptions and the heady atmosphere of a humid summer night on the brink of a thunderstorm. In my opinion, the director missed a great opportunity to make that moment as intense and climactic as it was in Brontë's imagination.  <br />Other than that, I was open to each actor's unique interpretations of the characters. Despite any reservations you may have, I think you will find this film enjoyable. If you're willing to give yourself over to it with an open mind, you may just find a lovely film that will keep you happy and cozy on a rainy winter's day. Enjoy!
B00000DCER|3.0|Though Hooker is a legend, someone with a little more time, could have certainly put together, something better than this. If I was John Lee, I certainly would have wanted something a lot stronger, and wilder, to be my swan song. One song in particular makes me want to use some magical power to get it off the CD, and that's \\"Tupelo\\". Being forced to listen to that, is like listening to your 6th grade teacher sloooowwwllly scratch her nails on a blackboard. If your image of Hooker, is him, playing a song, in the original \\"Blues Brother's\\" movie, stomping his feet in the street, shaking up, the entire city of Chicago, then don't get this CD, because it will ruin your memories of him!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I saw this concert live in Vegas Madonna is the ultimate performer of all time no one her age and beauty are moving and singing the way she is.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|Two things that crack me up in reading reviews of this movie are:  1) when folks point out all the \\"unrealistic\\" things in the movie, and 2) when folks point out how silly it is that Tubbs and Crocket are so somber and serious.  Among other things, buying this dvd gets you fantastic extras, including two minimovies on the realism (basically, how millions of dollars and months of preproduction were spent copying things exactly), plus a full length commentary by Michael Mann, which is the best commentary I've ever heard for a movie.  You learn that the script was basically written after extensive interviews with undercover DEA agents and professional informants.  Yes, some DEA and FBI stuff gets laid on Crockett and Tubbs (who, technically, are Miami Vice) but for those who think the whole thing is an elaborate fantasy and that only \\"The Wire\\" tells you how reality works, you should know that almost everything is based on fact down to the tiniest detail.  In fact, one of the reason Crockett and Tubbs are so somber and serious and have so little to say (no donut jokes) is that they spent months shadowing the guys who really do this and they modeled their performances on how these guys really are.  It's a very intense and edgy thing to be undercover, and the guys who are the deepest really are flying planes and making deals in foreign countries all on their own with no backup and with crime syndicates doing extensive background checks on them.<br /><br />The movie will obviously disappoint anyone looking for a conventional narrative.  We don't have an obvious story arc, and the audience is expected to figure out what's going on without lots of repetition.  (For example, the reason they're undercover is because of a leak in the Federal command superstructure, but if you were munching on your popcorn for that line, you're out of luck.)  I saw the movie in the theater and on dvd, and I actually preferred the dvd, because I could catch lines that were inaudible in the theater.  If there's one complaint I have about the film, it's that Gong Li can be very hard to understand.  That said, Mann's commentary taught me that some of the key players in this world are multilingual and aren't necessarily speaking their native language.  Again, something that seems like a Hollywood mistake (\\"they got an actress who can't pronounce English\\") may not be off the mark.<br /><br />What this movie succeeds in doing, beyond any movie I've seen, is to make you feel like you're actually there.  Mann's pioneering work in filming at night, plus his breakthrough work in aerial filming, go to places film has never been before.  In addition, he doesn't use many \\"effects.\\"  When a car is shot up by a canon-rifle, you're watching it really happen.  So you actually feel like you're at a nighttime drug buy, or along the Miami river, or in speedboat, or in Havana.  On a side note, a number of reviewers have mentioned how unrealistic it is that Crocket just drives his boat to Havana.  Listen to Mann's commentary:  that really is Colin Farrell driving that speedboat 70 miles an hour off the tip of Florida, which would take him less than 80 minutes to get to Havana.  Again, it seems like viewers don't want to feel like they're actually there because they think they're being duped.  But it's like they're used to what counts as \\"this is real\\" from movies.  The same people probably thought \\"Traffic\\" was realistic, when it was a great example of Hollywood's \\"realism\\" which is often cliche in itself [hand held cameras, melodramatic acting, tragic figures -- \\"oh this is the street!\\"].<br /><br />A fantastic dvd to buy, which amazing extras, a cinematic experience that feels new every time I watch it, and a compelling film that challenges the audience to do the thinking.<br /><br />P.S.  For those who wonder what \\"director's cut\\" means, Mann has really only added a few minutes of footage.  To me, it smoothes out the beginning and the end, but you may not even notice.heater.

The same people probably thought \\"Traffic\\" was realistic, when it was a great example of Hollywood's \\"realism\\" which is often cliche in itself [hand held cameras, melodramatic acting, tragic figures -- \\"oh this is the street!\\"]. <br /> <br />A fantastic dvd to buy, which amazing extras, a cinematic experience that feels new every time I watch it, and a compelling film that challenges the audience to do the thinking. <br /> <br />P.S.  For those who wonder what \\"director's cut\\" means, Mann has really only added a few minutes of footage.  To me, it smoothes out the beginning and the end, but you may not even notice.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Except for a couple of minor quibbles, I loved this version. Like another reviewer mentioned, I thought it dwelt far too little on Lowood.  Some of the more passionate scenes I thought were a little over the top (such as when Rochester is caressing Jane on the bed), but on the whole it really was terrific.  Beautiful cinematography.  Ruth Wilson was quite good as Jane, and I actually thought Toby Stephens was a very convincing Rochester (in my mind he was the most magnetic Rochester cast).  I was glad to see this version devote time to the Rivers family after Jane leaves Thornfield, in fact I enjoyed the second part of the series more than the first part.  It far outshone the horrendous William Hurt version and the 1940s version (in which Joan Fontaine was horribly miscast).  I'm adding it to my DVD collection!
B000KQGP2G|5.0|In the CD packaging where most people will likely not look lies the answer to their question. Is Scarsick the conceptual follow-up to the band's The Perfect Element I released in 2000? The answer is yes. The faint title in the inlay, right inside the CD tray reads: The Perfect Element, Part II - \\"He\\". Divided into two main parts, simply called Side A and B, Scarsick presents both the newly found musical style of Pain of Salvation, and picks up exactly where the previous album left off.<br /><br />For those who may have been put off by the two controversial songs \\"America\\" and \\"Disco Queen\\", it has to be pointed out that these tracks work a lot better in the context of the album. There is a reason why \\"America\\", a song which in no way is targeting the American people but rather their government's foreign policy, and \\"Disco Queen\\", whose curious style has previously been experimented by the likes of Mr Bungle, follow the deeply moving \\"Cribcaged\\", featuring in many ways Daniel Gildenlow's most touching vocal performance on this disc. Right from the beginning where you can hear a baby (Daniel's son?) laughing and some beautiful blues-tinged guitar tones ringing atop the guiding piano melody, Daniel sings in a tone that will make you melt. It's one of those Pain of Salvation songs that grows on and on until its terrific main chorus kicks, albeit slightly  differently this time around given its repeated F-word lines, and Daniel just pours pure, sheer emotion into the piece, climaxing at around the 4:01 mark and cementing the opinion that he is still the best singer in this style, period. (Speaking of the F-word, if people are really that offended by it, maybe they should listen to Bon Jovi's \\"It's My Life\\". Now that's a great song, no?)<br /><br />As with Be, there will no doubt be fans who will not like this album, but I seriously cannot think anyone won't shudder when they hear the sad vocals of \\"Cribcaged\\" or the superb vocal melody achieved at around 5:57 on \\"Spitfall\\", another cut that will divide the band's fanbase because of its rap-like vocals. Mind you, the vocals are very intentional as the purpose of this song is to criticise the rap/hiphop culture in the States along with parts of modern society at large. That said, the way Daniel delivers the lines \\"There's nothing like a broken childhood / There's nothing like a broken home\\" is so painful and honest any long-time fan is bound to feel the message.<br /><br />\\"Disco Queen\\", which I now consider one of the best songs on the album, also holds an important place in the album in that it actually emphasizes the conceptual lyrical imagery presented in the first part. Unlike \\"In the Flesh\\", however, which was a song about physical abuse, \\"Disco Queen\\" is about sexual abuse with clever lyrical imageries portraying the prostitution of the soul. The ever-present dichotomies, shifting from light verses to the comical, hysterial disco beats in a split second are simply hilarious.<br /><br />Side B seems less experimental, but it's actually equally bizarre. The looped, static key patch buried underneath the guitar riffs of \\"Mrs Modern Mother Mary\\" evoke Kevin Moore during his Chroma Key and film soundtrack phase, with futuristic soundscapes and acrobatic, unique vocals. \\"Kingdom of Loss\\" is the touching sequel to \\"King of Loss\\", and it seems they even assigned part of the lead work to the amazing solo heard at the end. Unfortunately, it is not credited in the booklet, but I feel this one is played by Daniel and the impact, given it enters the song after nice, soothing flute sounds, is phenomenal.<br /><br />\\"Idiocracy\\" was one of those songs that just escaped me upon the first couple of times, but now after having spent over two weeks with Scarsick, it's become one of my favourites. The intro here is unbelievably huge and epic sounding, thanks to Fredrik Hermansson's keyboards, and Daniel's vocals are impossibly emotional. Littered with both electric and acoustic guitar sections, itis the finale of this song that is so uniquely haunting.<br /><br />Drummer Johan Langell is arguably the most standout member behind Daniel Gildenlow on this album. His tone and widely eclectic playing style could be his best in his career yet. The Tool-like tribal drumming on the aggressive title track, resolving with weird harmonies, and the bone-crushing slam of \\"Flame to the Moth\\", the album's heaviest and meanest piece, are spectacular. The drum run is eerily evocative of Entropia, but when juxtaposed with the weird, metrical guitar riffery, the syncopation becomes simply monstrous, much like the material we hear on Lamb of God and Meshuggah songs. Add to this the maniacal screaming from Daniel and you have a winner. We never heard Daniel scream like this before.<br /><br />Much like the previous albums, Scarsick ends with another epic: \\"Enter Rain\\", a song that is both challenging in its ten-plus-minute running time and compositional style. Lyrically, it hints at the main character's suicide where he stays on top of a building and says, \\"In two seconds I will hit the ground\\". But also worth reading into is the shared lyrical theme from Remedy Lane's \\"A Trace of Blood\\", which appears during the second part of the song, simply titled \\"Standing\\" (the others being \\"Running\\" and \\"Falling\\" - note the reference to TPE1). This is the part where his scars, wounds, pain and filth are washed away. It all ends on a dreary, cold note with deafening police and ambulance sirens.<br /><br />There are numerous references made to the previous albums on Scarsick, both musically and lyrically. This certainly helps unify the messages Daniel Gildenlow tries to convey. While the first part of the album depicted the relation between the individual and society, and how it is actually the society itself that forms and shapes the individuals it is so quick to condemn as 'sick', we had insight into the minds and souls, or psychologies if you will, of those individuals on part one. Scarsick now takes the matter and explores it on a more sociological level, still referencing the characters' past, but mostly focusing on the evolution of He. As the booklet implies, the story is to be continued, and perhaps it will be the story of She that will be the more symphonically arranged and painstakingly composed album, as Daniel has revealed before.<br /><br />Of course, many will write off Scarsick, claiming it fails to touch the brilliance of the band's prior efforts like The Perfect Element I and Remedy Lane, whilst it will also bring in new fans to the band. It is unfortunate that some will write it off as boring without really giving it its deserved time and spins, but that's the fate of many other prog albums.<br /><br />Scarsick is best enjoyed if taken as a new album that stands on its own merits. Sure it goes all the way back touching upon everything Daniel has released, but in the end, it's still its own work. Keep that in mind.o uniquely haunting.

0141439661|4.0|Several well-spaced readings of this novel during a long life have not yet enabled me to tell what happens in it.  There is a superb early chapter in which Elinor and Marianne's sister-in-law pares away the direction expressed by her dying father-in-law that his son share his inheritance with his half-sisters and their mother.  Jane Austen manages this almost as well as Shakespeare has Goneril and Regan stripping King Lear of his \\"retinue of an hundred knights\\".  Then towards the end of the novel, when Elinor keeps vigil at her gravely ill sister's bedside, a horseman arrives who turns out to be the very last person she expected.  Between these memorable events, try as I might, I cannot distinguish between most of the numerous female and the few aloof, mysterious and unpredictable male characters, neither can I sort out how they are interacting.<br /><br />What delights me, however, on every page is Jane Austen's prose.  Every sentence is carefully fitted into its place, every word connotes its precise meaning, every adjective such as \\"affable\\" and \\"agreeable\\" carrying a specific ranking in a scale of values.<br /><br />In today's parlance, I suppose I would say that the plot and the characters lack the edge that is so sharp and memorable in other of Jane Austen's novels.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|If you're into the emotions you experience watching footage of suicide bombers blowing up people, you will enjoy this movie. If I had been alone, I would have left. It almost made me angry watching it because I saw no point in making a movie like this. Is wasn't \\"Crash\\", although perhaps it was meant to be. I really disliked it and gave it one star because the production was so professional. If you want to see an award nominated movie try \\"Liitle Miss Sunshine\\", instead. At least you'll feel good when you leave.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see the CONFESSIONS show in Miami.  This excellent DVD/CD combo makes me feel like I'm there again.  THANK YOU MADONNA!
B00005QJDG|5.0|Wow, a 3 disc live album taken from a single performance in New York City near the end of the \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" tour.  This is, simply put, Dream Theater's best live album and a portrait of a band at the absolute top of their game.  This marathon concert was captured in it's entirety giving the band room to fit in many of their longer pieces that shine in all their glory.  The entire \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" concept album is played from beginning to end including \\"Metropolis Part 1\\" from \\"Images And Words\\" which was part of the original story.  The almost 25 minute \\"A Change Of Seasons\\" is here, as is the complete \\"Mind Beside Itself\\" trilogy of \\"\\"Erotomania\\", \\"Voices\\" and \\"The Silent Man\\".  Some of these live versions are arguable better than the original studio versions.  Each member of the band gets the chance to solo with Jordan Rudess pulling off a mind blowing keyboard spot at the end of disc two.  The band is augmented by a gospel choir during \\"scenes\\" and additional female vocals are provided by Theresa T who shines on several numbers on the disc.  I think that the biggest highlight of this album is James Labrie.  Back when I first discovered Dream Theater I always thought that he was the weak link in the band, but the guy just keeps improving and getting better and his performance on this disc is nothing short of magnificent.  The soul wrenching \\"Spirit Carries On\\" complete with Theresa and gospel choir in full voice still sends chills up my spine.  Labrie is simply incredible on this song as it stands out as one of the high points on this album.  His vocal work on \\"Through Her Eyes\\" is incredible and he even belts out the rockers with more ferocity than I have heard from him before.  The bottom line......if you are looking to pick up a Dream Theater live disc, skip over \\"Once In A Livetime\\" and \\"Live At The Marquee\\" and go for this one.  You won't be disappointed.
0385472951|4.0|Do not look here if you want a book report of THE PARTNER, but I will tell you my opinion of this John Grisham novel.  Again, Grisham uses a troubled/scheming lawyer in dramatic fashion.  I truely enjoyed the story from cover to cover.  I was somewhat dissappointed in the ending, but every book cannot be exactly how we want it.  If you are thinking of reading this book, it is an easy, enjoyable read.

0140434135|4.0|'Northanger Abbey' is Austen's first novel to be written, though it was published after others.  The protagonist Catherine comes of age in her first thorough exposure to the society of adults.  This involves going to balls, falling in love, meeting a couple undesirable people, and forever discarding some childish beliefs and fancies. <br /> <br />When I pick up a classic I tend to expect and anticipate heavier reading than in a modern novel.  'Northanger' didn't have that depth I was looking for; it was more of a romantic drama, a genre that usually doesn't do it for me (with certain notable exceptions such as the superb 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' by Anne Bronte).  Yet it surprised me with its wit and characterization. <br /> <br />Austen renders, with great skill, several characters possessing a variety of personalities.  Dialogue here is a delight to read and animates Austen's cast.  You'll find at least one you can relate to; for me it was Catherine's brother James and also Eleanor Tilney.  Though what seems a bit off to me is how the younger ones (especially Henry & Eleanor Tilney) tend to act more mature than the older folks!  I can't recall a single grownup over 40 in the book who I would have serve as a role model to me.  Perhaps Catherine's mother, but she barely plays a part in the novel.  Henry Tilney is clearly cast in this role and he seems far more mature than the average 26 year old. <br /> <br />I've read a couple of Austen's later works (Pride & Prejudice, Persuasion) and I tend to agree with other reviewers that 'Northanger' doesn't have the depth and subtlety that Austen develops later in her career.  Sure I recommend it once you've exhausted the stable of superb British classics out there from the 19th century.  I just started Thomas Hardy's 'Tess of D'Urberville' and I have to admit the contrast from 'Northanger' was a bit of a shock.  Hardy's writing is on another (higher) level entirely.
B000K7UBTI|1.0|I was really excited about this movie with the new fangled( who says new fangled anymore) cgi animation mixed with trditional, andf it was decent, not the best I'd ever seen. Kinda reminded me of the old G.I.Joe's where they all walked stiff and talked with little expression. I applaud them using tony stark as the playboy he was, but the story was horrible and the mandarin could have been used so much better. That was really weak. Anyway, I think this will disapoint any die hard iron man fan. I hope doctor strange redeems this movie.
B000KRNCYY|2.0|Although these women have great singing voices the music sounds as if it was created by Disney.  If you are a fan of and own the Lion King CD you will love this CD.  I was looking more for music like the Midevil babes, who I like because of there style of music and beutiful voices but this is not it.  I was looking forward to this music since I heard one song on PBS.  Should have investigated more.
B0002HTZJI|2.0|This CD definately captures the energy of the audiance but not the quality of a good RHCP show. When you first listen tothis album you will be stunned at how amazing it sounds, but as you listen to  it a couple of times you will soon realize some major problems with it. first of all the vocals are really weak and you can barely here them on many of the songs. Second Anthony Kiedis sound almost out of breath half the time, and having seen a concert my self i know that this is not how he really performs. third John Frusciante just wasn't on his game for this show as his harmonies sound pretty bad most of the time and especially on the song californication. Once again having seen the band perform i LOVE John and think that he is an amazing guitarist and vocalist, that being said, this album does him no justice. I think that the 2 songs really worth listening to on this CD are Leverage Of Space, and Rolling Sly Stone other than these 2 the concert is mediocer for such an amazing band as RHCP! if you want an example of an AMAZING Chili Peppers concert Live ant Slane Castle is definatly worth your time
B000021Y77|5.0|and more advanced ones, too.     ACTION: Lola must run across Berlin in 20 minutes to get to her boyfriend, Manni, and save him from being killed by Ronnie, to whom Manni owes 100,000 DM. \\"Lola rennt\\" literally means, \\"Lola runs\\".  Not, \\"Run, Lola, Run.\\" Unlike young Forest Gump, no one tells Lola to run. And, unlike Forest Gump, she does not run to save her on skin from bullies.  Lola's own gumption tells her to run--which she does in order to save the man she loves, and at considerable risk to herself. RENNT--a verb meaning \\"runs\\", also translates as \\"races\\".  She races because she is determined that she can do the impossible. Lola--with her orange hair, green pants and blue top--is one spunky-punky girl.    DIALOGUE: sparse, but significant and quotable. My university freshman German students love to repeat, \\"Die Tasche!\\" \\"Die Tasche!\\"; the simple phrase which Lola and Manni exclaim to each other when they notice that the \\"money bag\\" is missing.  Earlier, in the red-tinted bedroom scene, Lola poses the important question, \\"do you love me?\\"; and Manni poses the bizzare but pivital question, \\"what would you do if I died?\\" Lola's race through Berlin proves HER love. LOLA RENNT, continually surprising us with possiblities multiple race-scenarios asks the question \\"WHAT IF?\\"
B00005JO9J|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD set.  The first season was short (only 9 episodes) because Grey's started as a mid season replacement.  But these shows are the beginning of a phenomenon.  The characters in this show are incredibly intriguing yet flawed.  It's very interesting to follow them through their mistakes and triumphs. The on-screen chemistry between Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey is amazing.  Sandra Oh and Isaiah Washington are fantastic together.  There is not a character on this show that I don't love in one way or another.  I watched season 1 after viewing all of season 2.  It was odd to go back but very nice to see how these characters and this incredible show all started!  If you are new to Grey's, the season ends with a huge surprise.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Simply put....This is the best CD that I have bought in a long long time. If you love Rock n' Roll and into bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Who, Pink Floyd and The Doors then you will love this album and I recommend you should buy it today.<br />It's hard to pick out any standout tracks as they all rock, but if you have heard Mind's Eye and White Unicorn played on the radio and love them, then don't hesitate to buy this CD. It takes you straight back to the seventies and these three guys from the Sydney suburb of Erskinville, which has always been a haven for kickass live pub bands, deliver their music with so much energy and raw emotion, it is like growing up with all those legendary rock n' roll bands all over again.<br /><br />Rock on Wolfmother....<br /><br />ps...It is also worth noting Dave Sardy produced this album. He is a great producer who has produced albums for artists such as Oasis, Chris Cornell, Primal Scream, The Rolling Stones, Nine Inch Nails and Jet.
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|This movie is interesting. It is captivating visually as well as by sound. The acting is strong, stellar quality. The music fits perfectly. The story is weak... at least that part which we are privy to. And that is the problem here.<br /><br />We, the audience, are not privy to anything. We are entertained by the illusionist throughout the story... not even a crumb of something is thrown at us with which to relish. We know less than half the characters in the story.<br /><br />Only until the final 5 minutes are we given any sort of explanation. And I feel we are cheated by that. What is never explained are the ghost-like figures that The Illusionist summons up in his performances and which he uses to escape by. Not a nice thing to do guys... after all... you are playing to us.<br /><br />What I did like was the costumes and sets.... brilliant and very eloquent. It was reminiscent of Doctor Zhivago in that the period was displayed very well.<br /><br />The acting was very very good also. Norton and the rest played well off each other in a very convincing manner.<br /><br />But... the story lacks. And to have a quick, flashback style explanation was insulting, hence the low points. If you're going to have a mystery, Agatha Christie is the only one privy to behind the scenes development. And even she fully explained things in the end. This one didn't.
0385486804|3.0|The greatest of adventures are often journeys toward something; this book, at times, however, read like the account of the journey home.  The turning of each page was a personal struggle to justify Chris McCandless's worthiness of having his story told.  What made the 203 pages worthy of your eyes and mind, though, was the brilliance of Jon Krakauer's defining of the tragedy. <br /> <br />Chris was not a rare person in that it was the incomplete realization of his greatest strengths that were also his most profound weaknesses.  Anyone familiar with the story could easily have dismissed it as a tale of an over-ambitious youth, struggling unnecessarily with mundane complexities of interpersonal relationships, and arriving at a radical and ultimately tragic resolution.  Krakauer, however, discovered and portrayed in him an intense radiance that revealed the extraordinary in the otherwise unremarkable. <br /> <br />\\"He was looking for more adventure and freedom than today's society gives people... [he] yearned to wander unchartered country, to find a blank spot on the map.  In 1992, however, there were no more blank spots on the map... [so] he simply got rid of the map.\\" <br /> <br />The book appealed to me more as an account of the writer's adventure to a preconceived conclusion; an account of the justification of his own heart's insistence that there was a tragedy here greater and more universal than the death of this young man - perhaps of every young man. <br /> <br />At the book's conclusion, I felt as if I had somehow in the journey home arrived at the end of an unexpected adventure, finally convinced of Chris McCandless's worthiness to have his story told simply because it inspired a gifted storyteller to tell it.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|This sleeper/cult film is a true gem to those who like thrillers. It has survived over 30 years and is still going strong. That is indeed the trademark of a classic. <br />When this film was released in 1974 it didn't do well. There was a film released back in '63 that was also a good little slasher film, but with a different type of story called 'Dementia 13'. One thing I can see this film borrowing from that one is where the camera is sometimes shot from the view of the killer. But in Black Christmas the killer is never revealed. <br />It is also easy to see where following films borrowed, and may have added, from this one. Halloween certainly did borrow and added the music. Friday the 13th also borrowed the gathering of young people and the slashing. <br />Two others that I believe have borrowed are the original 'When a Stranger Calls' and 'Scream'. The scenes where the telephone becomes the instrument with which to terrorize are directly from this one. <br />So... in a number of ways this film set many standards of thrilling and chilling. <br />After seeing this movie for the first time after about 25 years I began to realize all of this. This film also has enough humor to balance the fright, simple sets, simplistic acting, direct lines and great sets. It really does have it all. <br />So for those of you who like to get creeped out and scared silly, this is the one to get before the others. A classic, a must own.
B000GY729M|4.0|This album does not have many dance-punk tracks as the first album. I loved most tracks on their album \\"Hot Fuss.\\" You definately still hear the new-wave sounds in this new album. The Killers are fortunate for becoming a mainstream band you hear on the radio, unlike many bands that have a close sound to 'The Killers' but stay in the indie scene. As an indie fan, they are one of the very few bands I like from modern radio. For all you fans of 80's influenced or new wave/post-punk rock bands like 'The Killers' you should try listening to these 2 indie rock bands: \\"Editors\\" who have an album called \\"The Back Room\\" and \\"The Stills\\" who have an album called \\"Logic Will Break Your Heart\\"
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|This is a very interesting adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's novel. I  don't find it necessary that a film follow a great book in every jot and detail. It would a problem only if the film somehow replaced the original; but we still have that!     Having said that, I do agree with previous viewers that too little attention is given to the reasons Jane and Rochester, as well as other characters, like Helen, are who they are and behave the way they do.    If you leave out the Christian basis of Jane's character and behavior then the story doesn't make much sense, at least not in the way the author intended it to make sense. Why is she so serene after a really awful childhood? Is she just one of those people by nature? Why is Rochester so attracted to her? Is it only because she's so young and fresh and pretty? Why is she in love with Rochester? Is it because he's rich and she has nobody in the world.. and that's all? From the movie alone, I'd say that might be the case.    The movie does improve on one character: Pilot is one toothy, pointy-nosed, wiry-furred cutie, although I'm not sure he's a very good Christian.

B000068OCS|5.0|I produce corporate videos.  My work has been informed by the mesmerizing images and non-conventional storytelling I first encountered years ago when I saw Koyaanisqatsi on a large screen in the theater.  The images were crisp and breathtaking -- little stood between the experiencer and the lens on the camera that had photographed those powerful images. <br /> <br />Without a story or a plot, this film's parade of images engaged me -- I thought about things, had insights, drew conclusions, yet I was not told WHAT to think as in other films.  Therefore, what I took away from this film was all the more powerful, because I made it, not had it handed to me. <br /> <br />The disk provides but a memory of that experience to me.  I have a sophisticated viewing set-up -- a DVD player that 'up-rez'es the images to 1080i feeding a CRT broadcast evaluation monitor.  My speakers are industry-standard evaluation monitors. <br /> <br />This set-up revealed banding (posterization) and MPEG artificating, suggesting the disk was a cheap single-layer (4.7Gig), not dual-layer (8.5Gig).  My examination of the disk confirmed -- single layer (sigh). <br /> <br />I guess I can always HOPE for a future release that will have a 10-bit transfer and will support a bit-rate that will do justice to the subtle shadings and detail in the static scenes and, during the high-delta (change/motion) scenes, won't deliquesce (melt) into a techno-psychedelia of MPEG macroblocks ('pixilate'). <br /> <br />I gave the FILM the five stars.   <br /> <br />I give the DISK no stars.
1401301010|5.0|This is probably the most entertaining book ive ever read. I asked for it for christmas a couple of years ago, and I couldnt put it down. Ive since read it three times over. I love it. Its consistantly good throughout, and even though it seems like alot of pages, you want more. It was really cool to hear his version on his life, what he was feeling when he wrote the songs we heard later. He doesnt just talk about music, he talks about everything from the day he was concieved in winter on a lil mountain to the present.  <br />Biographys are my favorite to read because fact is stranger than fiction, and this one is by far the best! The stories he tells are good stories no doubt.. and you prolly love Anthony's music or you wouldnt be reading it, but they are delivered so well you're thinking about them for a long time after you've stoped reading. Some are funny, some are sad, all are entertaining, and very interesting to read.  <br />I would very much recommend this book for anyone to read who is into sex, drugs and rock n' roll.  <br /> <br />~Ashleigh
B000F39MAQ|5.0|When watching this starkly modern rendition of Verdi's all-too-familiar masterpiece \\"La Traviata\\" it is best to abandon all pre-conceived notions about how this work should look and feel and just watch it for what it is: A new reading of a well-known opera. Not only is the singing universally outstanding, but the conceptualizing is refreshing and very much exciting. I, too, had my misgivings during the opening act's party scene, but I was willing to give the staging some time and discovered myself drawn in. By the end I was just beginning to fathom the ideas behind the use of a large clock to mark the passing of time and the sinister figure who later became the doctor in act three. This work will either impress or depress, but I guarantee it will not fail to leave its mark.
B000KRNCYY|3.0|I loved the celtic women CD and DVD. I thought their Christmas CD was lovely but... I really, really didn't like this CD. It has too many lame instrumentals and I hated \\"Scarborough Fair\\"\\" and \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\". I have gotten into Celtic music pretty seriously and this CD is just not very celtic.   None of the songs really excite me. I feel the song selection for this CD was poorly done. I'm glad to hear that the DVD was better but so what? That dosen't improve this lame CD. Why didn't the better songs get put on this CD.
B000EXZHAG|4.0|The blue and white beams on the cover, instead of yellow and green beams, and the fact this is an Import give away that this is the UK release of the CD instead of the US release, so Track 5 is The Exact Colour, not Nimos & Tambos, and Track 8 is Twyncyn/Trembling Willows, not Arrival/The Intention Craft. A bit academic, really, because all these tracks are excellent, melodic alt rock. The music sounds like a mixture of Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, The Beach Boys, Nirvana and Opeth. Some gorgeous harmonies from the male singers and the female singer, coupled with catchy melodies and some mellow tracks which rock-up sometimes. The lyrics make no sense, but sound good anyway. An interesting new sound (they even use some violin) which could well leave you hooked. Recommended.
B000GG4Y32|4.0|'Reds' is the true story of American communist John \\"Jack\\" Reed, his relationship with journalist Louise Bryant, and the overall \\"leftist\\" movement in America during WW1 and it's aftermath. Jack Reed was a journalist and fiery leftist activist who frequently supported union causes and other workers movements. His circle of friends consisted of writer Eugene O'Neil, anarchist Emma Goldman, and feminist journalist Louise Bryant who would become his wife. The film essentially follows Jack as he progresses from a journalist and activist to a full-fledged communist. After being heavily involved in workers causes and the anti-war movement at home, Jack decides to go to Russia to cover the unfolding Bolshevik revolution. It is here where he becomes an active supporter of the international communist revolution and even rubs elbows with figures such as Lenin, Trotsky, and Radek. One of the sub-plots of the film is Reed's turbulent relationship with Lousie Bryant. I found their relationship to be very strange but moving in it's own right.<br /><br />Although it started off a bit slow, 'Reds' developed into a very engrossing film. Not only was it a film about the American leftist movement, but also a good portrayal of the Russian Revolution. I found the film to be sympathetic to the person of Jack Reed and his original friends but not necessarily the communist movement. On the contrary, the film shows the growing disillusionment of Reed's friends, and eventually Reed himself, as the \\"party\\" evolved into the totalitarian monster that it was. There was a sense of tragic irony that the movement that they helped create turned out to be worse than the \\"evils\\" they set out to destroy. All in all, 'Reds' is a compelling historical drama about a little-known portion of American history. I would recommend it highly to any lover of history or student of political movements. My only warning would be to those who don't like long films. 'Reds' clocks in at just over four hours long.
0790734850|3.0|DePalma's \\"The Black Dahlia\\" blows this out of the water as far as noir films go. And, didn't ANYONE notice that James Ellroy even praised that movie to the high heavens???! Now, about Curtis Hanson's \\"L.A. Confidential\\", I don't recall Ellroy ever uttering a word about the film version of his work. Yes, it's set in the 50's, as opposed to the 40's like \\"Dahlia\\", but this is a film that I've owned on VHS before, and had to watch it every so many months to remember what it was even about. And, the dialogue is bad, for a noir film, that is - except for a few words here or there, this dialogue could be in any modern film about any modern story. And the visual style just doesn't really go in the world of noir like Hanson would want it to.<br />I've just recently viewed this film, so it's fresh in my memory as I write this. The best part of noir in the film was in the movie being made in the film. Now, that was NOIR! And, that's the kind of film DePalma modeled his latest classic on. Hanson, on the other hand creates a terrific atmosphere, and directs a very stellar cast (but I do not see why Kim Basinger won the Academy award for her role in this, for she is good, but she drolls out the same kind of 'whisper-talk acting' that makes it very hard to hear her at times, plus it is extremely nerve-jarring, like she did in \\"Final Analysis\\". And, to think that people are comparing Scarlett Johannson's great performance in \\"Dahlia\\" to hers is beyond me. Plus, where do people get that she's a femme fatale??? That description does NOT fit her character!), and weaves a wonderful story, but it just never quite feels like noir. It looks too flashy, too modern, well, like a film ABOUT a film noir story would look like, intead of going for a flat out film noir approach, like Brian DePalma dared to do with \\"The Black Dahlia\\".<br />I would give this film 4 stars for the great cast (except Danny Devito, who did a great job, but was miscast in my opinion), and for the story line, but the look of the film gnawed at me several times. As a matter of fact, I would give it 5 stars for the story, but again I stress that this is NOT what film noir is supposed to look like! It is a movie that I would recommend, even highly so, but not if I were referring someone to take in a good film noir. For that, I would steer them toward \\"Double Idemnity\\", \\"The Big Sleep\\", DePalma's \\"Snake Eyes\\", the Coen Brothers' \\"Blood Simple\\", DePalma's \\"The Black Dahlia\\", Ridley Scott's sci-fi noir \\"Blade Runner\\", DePalma's \\"Obsession\\", Bryan Singer's \\"The Ususal Suspects\\", \\"Bound\\", James Mangold's \\"Identity\\", or back to earlier classics like \\"Dead Ringer\\" (with Bette Davis and Karl Malden), \\"D.O.A.\\" (and I don't mean the horrendous Dennis Quaid/Meg Ryan remake), or Hitchcock's \\"Stagefright\\", \\"Shadow Of A Doubt\\", or \\"Saboteur\\". So, to recap, as a modern film, this is a great movie, but as film noir, I can only give it 3 stars at most. (Like \\"The Green Mile\\", a movie I love, but have trouble with because it is a period piece, yet the dialogue could be out of any modern film.) I just appreciate it more when a filmmaker is true to the era they are filming. Thank you.the film gnawed at me several times.

B000F6IOC0|4.0|Despite some of the CGI work and sfx in the truck chase and helicopter scenes being a bit sub-par, Kate Beckinsale's second outing as Selene the vampiress to die for is good entertainment, with a plot that keeps its claws in you.  Derek Jacobi looks a bit bemused except when he's being oracular or noble, but Bill Nighy has a good time, and so did I.  I'm not a huge fan of Horror movies or Vampire flicks, but this one is a fang or two above the average!
B000929AJQ|2.0|When NIN released this cd, i was super excited, having fallen in love with TDS...But when I bought it, I couldn't help but feel like I'd been ripped off...There's a weird thing with this cd. It feels like the songs are more like demos from the band, not fully finished tracks. Another main problem with the cd is the way some of the tracks seem to be using a formula now. The cd didn't come with any liner notes, but if you've heard 2 or more of their cd's, you won't need any. You'll probably be able to just guess what he's gonna say next. It feels like he sold out on some songs. But it isn't all bad. All the love in the world, You know what you are, Hand that feeds, Only, Everyday is exactly the same, and right where it belongs are good, (and the bonus Home), but that's less than half of the songs, and the album is too short...It just doesn't feel like enough for a six year wait...
B000LPQ6DE|1.0|Where to begin?  This was so badly done that I was in shock after the first part shown on PBS's Masterpiece Theater, and felt compelled to watch the second half just to see if it could possibly get any worse. <br />It did.  Cinematography was terrible---much too dark and gloomy.  Yes, the story, the locales, and many of the characters are dark and gloomy but that doesn't mean viewers should need a candle to see the sets.  I kept wanting to give the actors flashlights so they wouldn't run into the furniture.  The acting was marginal--and I am very much a fan of Toby Stephens but he was not well cast here.  The dialogue was too modern and seeing Rochester pawing and drooling at Jane was really too much to be borne.  Even A&E's 2-hour version was better and they skimmed over quite a bit of detail  (Just goes to show what excellent acting can accomplish). <br />Charlotte Bronte would be embarassed by this poor effort, as should the BBC be for doing \\"Jane Eyre Lite\\" for folks who don't want to read the book or care what it's really about.  It was simply dreadful.  <br />
6305513414|3.0|To all of you detractors, after watching Mudd's Women for the second time, I found that I liked it much more than I had previously. Sure, it's sexist.  But let's delve into that - is it the show that is sexist, or the society itself?  When Eve murmurs childishly, \\"I've never met a paragon before\\", we are met with an indulgent Shatner smile.  And the miners themselves, with their expectations of what a woman should be -- and they are proven wrong in the end.  Yes, it is disgusting to watch the crewmembers oggle such women promoting themselves as sex objects, but this issue is addressed, and I felt that in total the episode promoted women (or at those with integrity).  Today, it seems sexist since the way we see it, women should really never have had to stoop to that position in the first place - for her time, Eve was positively heroic. <br /> <br />As for other pros, there is minimal overacting from the regular crew, especially Shatner - very nice - for the most part they just seem to oscillate between amused and frustrated in their dealings with Harry Mudd.  Mudd, however, comes off overdone, which we sense is less the actor and more the crappy costume and the silly stereotypical role he was supposed to fill -- his character jives better in his second season sequel \\"I Mudd\\" (possibly because he's more a sidethought than the obstacle itself). <br /> <br />I admit it; not the best Trek has to offer, even for this early in the series.  The next episode, the Kirk-centric \\"Enemy Within\\" is an improvement, managing to provide some character development while keeping in high drama.  The message that a man needs both his good and evil side to function effectively as a human is a little cliche, but it may have been fresh back then.  More important on the decisons being made on the characters -- Spock is slowly staking his claim to logical, emotionless Vulcan territory, while the doctor opts for the other end of the spectrum -- indeed, we even get to see them go at it for a brief scene; the first of many as we all know.  Looking back to the ambiguity of \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\", it's shocking that they've fallen into their roles as quickly as they have - this episode could have been anywhere else in the first half of Season One and I wouldn't have known otherwise.  It's nice to watch Spock act concerned in the background; we kind of lose this as the show goes on... <br /> <br />By the way, I still think that Shatner can't act.  But it's good fun all the same.
0380778556|1.0|I read this book many years ago. I knew it was a \\"classic\\", but it always reminded me of Jane Eyre (as another reviewer said). I didn't care too much for old Jane either, but at least she had the guts to stick up for herself.<br /><br />The heroine (not deserving of a name)is 21 years old, but she keeps harping throughout how young she is. Twenty-one, especially back in those days, was not \\"young\\". At that age, most women were responsible and mature. Not this lady. She's a paid \\"companion\\" (go-for)to a bossy American woman, currently vacationing in Monte Carlo. The heroine is from England apparently, although never actually stated. Max de Winter shows up at their hotel, takes her out to sketch, she falls madly in love, he marries her, ignores her, and treats her like a child.<br /><br />When they go back to wonderful Manderley, his ancestral home, she's intimidated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who her husband allows to lord it over his wife.<br /><br />Rebecca, his first wife, died 10 months prior to their marriage (or was she found 10 months prior, and missing for 2 months before that?). Anyway, Miss 21 year old, creates MANY imaginary conversations - the servants, the  neighbors, everyone is talking badly about her and comparing her unfavorably with Rebecca. She has a good imaginiation, but she wastes a lot of time. She lives in her own head a lot.<br /><br />She's crazy about her uncommunicative husband (well, he is all she has), and she does things like sketch, take the dog for walks, and have tea. The marriage seems totally chaste. Only towards the end of the book, does the author mention that the husband actually has a bed in the heroine's room (because he hadn't slept in it).<br /><br />She does show a lot of insight towards Maxim's grandmother - now that she is old,what is she thinking, feeling? How was it when she was young?<br /><br />There is plenty of description of the grounds surrounding Manderley, but the descriptions of the rooms in the house are confusing. I couldn't get a feel for how the house was set up. There is also no explanation as to why certain rooms (Rebecca's) are so great - just great  wallpaper, hangings, and a gold bedspread. Yeah, I can see it.<br /><br />SPOILER: After all her meltdowns over Rebecca, Maxim finally admits he killed her because she said she was pregnant by someone else (he couldn't bear a scandal - no divorce - all the neighbors would talk!). He had planned to kill her anyway, since he took the gun down to her little cottage.<br /><br />Now why would anybody stay with a man like that? He can't control his temper, cares overly what other people think, and is not bothered by murdering his wife. That's just plain stupid. And dangerous. He might kill her next. She better watch out.<br /><br />As for the \\"ending\\", it's abrupt and unsatisfying.<br /><br />Like Jane Eyre, this novel has a heroine who is poor (although Jane had more skills). The hero has a wife who has some mental aberrations (in Rebecca's case, she's cruel). The mansion burns down, and they all live happily ever after.e confusing.

0743270754|5.0|I will try to keep this brief.  This book was ten years in the making and is an astonishing achievement in research and execution.  The author's prose style is captivating (despite some unfortunate errors in usage and grammar).  This is the story that most of us never knew.  (I certainly didn't.)  Goodwin does well to narrow her focus and to avoid diverting the reader into a long history of the civil war.  She provides just enough background detail to give lincoln and his cabinet context.  She mentions several key battles, but always manages to keep the focus on Lincoln and his cabinet members and their often rocky relations.  A hard book to put down.  HOWEVER...she includes the text of the Gettysburg address, but not the Emancipation Proclamation about which she spends so many words.  An absurd omission.  She mentions many times Lincoln's trips to City Point during the war to meet with Grant.  WHERE IS CITY POINT?  She never says and it is not identified on the one pathetic map of civil war battles that is included.  It would have been useful to have a list of presidents and vice presidents of the time.  She mentions several, but a one-page chart with dates would have helped.  Goodwin nicely includes an Epilogue to tie up loose ends on the lives of the cabinet members and their families, but she never says what happened to Jefferson Davis or Robert E. Lee or the assassination conspirators.  An unacceptable omission.  And if her defense is that it is only about the cabinet members, then why did she include some who were not?  Oh, and one more thing, don't bother trying to look up anything in the bibliography, THERE IS NONE!  Despite my displeasure at what I consider serious omissions, this is truly a splendid book and a \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in the period.  Just one, brief mention of \\"Seward's folly\\", i.e., the purchase of Alaska.
0307383415|5.0|An interesting look into the life of a man who is considered a semi-serious presidential contender--written at a time when that likely was the farthest thought in his head.  Published a little more than 10 years ago, this story tells of Obama's heritage, his early life as a boy and takes us to about his mid-twenties.  He proves to be a very impressive person--modest, intelligent, quite introspective and not at all self-serving.  Very memorable for me were his real and painful struggles with identity, given his mixed-race parentage, in combination with his either inherited or nurtured drive to achieve and make a difference in the lives of less fortunates.    The writing itself is beautiful--sometimes even poetic. No one else is named as a co-writer with Obama, and so I must assume this is his work alone.  And if that is the case, I think that, with this talent,  he is nuts to be in politics!  Politcally speaking, he is definitely not my cup of tea, but this book does highlight his experiences and entire life-orientation, explaining and confirming the convictions that have placed him where he is on the political spectrum.  Be that as it may, it is a lovely and interesting read.
B0001I55SS|3.0|*SPOILERS INCLUDED* <br /> <br />The Black Hole is by no means a great movie but it's not a total disaster. Bad writing in my opinion is what hurts this movie. I agree with what one review I read said \\"Belongs in the Nice Try Catagory\\". The characters weren't that great except for Dr. Reinhardt played by Maximilian Schell whom we immediately see is totally crazy and evil and in fact looks it along with his red devilish robot Maximilian. The one character that I must say irritated me the most was Anthony Perkin's character. I don't say that Perkin's didn't do a good job, I think that character must not be very smart, now I don't mean in space science but in common sense. Perkin's character was so carried away by what Reinhardt had acheived that he didn't think twice about the situation and the warnings from his colligues went in one ear and out the other. Ernest Borgnine's character Harry Booth was okay but he seemed confused on certain things. First he tries to talk Robert Forrester into capturing Reinhardt's ship along with Reinhardt for failure to acknowlage the recall of his ship and the mysterous disappearance of the crew, and then he chickens out after learning what actually happened to the crew. The rest of the characters were okay and the afore mentioned characters were okay to but could have been better. I didn't understand the ending of this movie ether. <br /> <br />   To the things that were great about this film. The set pieces for the movie were great especially the design of U.S.S. Cygnus (Reinhardt's ship), production designer Peter Ellenshaw did a great job. I also loved the robots Vincent and Old Bob (Voiced by Roddy McDowell and Slim Pickens who received no screen credit) Why they weren't credited I don't know. I think most people would agree that John Barry's music score is terrific but then I don't know of one single John Barry score that isn't. The Cinematography by Frank Phillips was good as well and in fact went on to received an Oscar nomination I believe. <br /> <br />   All in all, this is an interesting movie to check out and I recommend you do so if you haven't. But don't expect anything like \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\". This is a Disney movie and for the most part they did a nice job, it's just the writing that hurts it. Watch and judge for yourself though.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|A very nice effort from this talented young lady.  Adding a bit sharper edge, Norah is still evolving to musician par excellence for seemly the gen-boomer.  The SNL gang once joked when NJ turned 25 saying \\"Norah Jones turned 25 today while her audience turned 50\\".  \\"Not Too Late\\" provides us with a nice mix of tunes while maintaining a somewhat delicate disposition!
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I have two other albums by Norah Jones and I love her voice. When I found out that this CD was coming out I bought it right away and was so excited to pop it into the player. I will never listen to it again! It is cynical and depressing.  She must have just gotten dumped by a boyfriend or betrayed by a friend. If you have a miserable life and want company, then this is the CD for you. And that's too bad, because her voice is fantastic.  I wish I didn't know what the words said, because then maybe I could at least enjoy the sound of her voice. This might make me hesitant to listen to her first two albums. If she is smart, she will stop production and issue an apology. <br />
B0002PUHF6|5.0|Based on a story by H.P. Lovecraft, this campy send-up follows an egotistical medical student (Jeffrey Combs) who develops a serum that revives the dead. Together with his girlfriend and his obdurate roommate, Combs reanimates a corpse but doesn't factor in certain complications that arise. Filled with equal parts laughter and gore, Re-Animator spawned a similarly outlandish sequel.Classic gorefest. Classic. It never lets up. Just when you think you've seen it all, it tops you. Tongue-in-cheek all the way, as funny as it is ghastly.  <br /> <br />Stuart Gordon has never made a film quite as outlandish and nerve-rattling as this one, although \\"From Beyond\\" was great, in a more cerebral vein. When I walked out of the theatre on first viewing \\"Re-Animator,\\" I was literally vibrating, nerves frayed. Exhilirating, in a very twisted way. This is a how a real  horror/comedic gory movie is suppost to be done.
B000001GXF|5.0|This is one of my favorite recordings.

The sound quality may not be quite up to that possible with modern recording technology but the quality of playing is superb.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I hope so. This features Jack Nicholson at his mephistophelean best as a Boston gangster. Nicholson should have been nominated for Best Supporting <br />Actor. The screenplay is exceptionally well written, and the entire cast <br />did a terrific job. My only complaint is that it's just a little too easy <br />to predict the ending.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|It's puzzling why this film was so derided on its original release.  Clearly, it is not a classic, but it is enjoyable enough - one can only think that the media were out to get Charlize Theron after her recent Oscar win. <br />It is the future - a short time from now a disease wipes out 99% of the population, until Trevor Goodchild finds a cure.  Now as the movie starts it is 400 years later and mankind is reduced to living in one walled city.  However, there is unrest in this Eutopia and resistance has sprung up, of which Aeon is one.  However, events unfold which lead her to question not just her orders but the truth of her very existence.  It's a neat set up, and the story is not as trite as you might expect - it has some genuine unexpected directions and a satisfying conclusion. <br />If the movie has a flaw, it's that it fails to find much heart - the Eutopia is by its nature pristine and cool, but the acting seems to fall into the same trap so that we don't find much humanity to relate to. This future is not just cool but sexy too - almost like an updated version of the future seen in 'Logans Run'.  If you have seen the movie you might be tempted to see this as a special effects movie, but in fact the effects serve the story well. <br />All in all a satisfying tale, which is crisply photographed and has a cast and art direction which are very easy on the eye.  I recommend it for an undemanding evenings entertainment where action is desired, but not at the expense of story.
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|Take two parts Bee Gees, one part Elton John, one part Queen, add a dash of eighties techno and shake vigorously ~ Ta-Dah. When I first purchased this album, I shyed away from it because of the abundant use of falsettos in the vocals. And so it sat, purchased but unused in a pile of music obtained over the holiday period. It was my loss. While I still find the falsetto a little annoying at times, it isn't used on every song on the album and sometimes it hits the mark dead on. The quirky (sometimes dirty) lyrics play along a bouncing beat that remind me of some of Freddie Mercury's more tongue-in-cheek creations. \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\", \\"She's My Man\\", and the darker \\"The Other Side\\" are more then worth the price of admission, but some of the other songs sound more like enjoyable, well-crafted filler. All in all this is a great second album from a band that deserves attention.

0920668372|4.0|\\"Love you forever\\" is a children's classic that people either love or hate. Some consider it a masterpiece of a mother's eternal love for her children.

0743289412|2.0|I finally finished this book, based on other reviews I was hoping it  was going to get a lot better, it got a little better.  There is no \\"error\\" on the answering machine as mentioned in another review, there were two answering machines and the policeman called the other one.  So he's not insulting our intelligence (unless of course you count buying this book in the first place).   It's a little like reading Dr.Seuss for adults with all his made up  words.  The repetition of said words is absolutely maddening, does  this man not have an editor to tell him this?  I'm a bit of a King fan  so this has been a very disappointing experience.  I read  the other reviews and think maybe the problem is mine but nonetheless  I found this to be a very difficult read which is not what I've come to   expect from Stephen King.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Joss Whedon has taken a much beloved (at least once on DVD) TV series, and transposed the characters to the big screen in a story that does them justice and moves the characters on, while never seeming like an extended episode.   <br />For those uninitiated with the series Firefly, this is a self contained film which requires no knoledge of the series- the excellent commentary shows what lengths they went to, even at the expense of some of the characters stories, to make this a complete experience.  However, you will benefit greatly from watching the 15 episodes of Firefly before watching this.  After all, the chances are you will be so hooked you will only want to go back and watch them anyway. <br />For those who love Firefly, this is a fitting continuation ( I can't bring myself to say conclusion, as I can't bear the thought that it would end here) answering some of the threads left hanging when the series so rudely ended.   <br />Nathan Fillion is captain of a small Firefly class ship - he is a disillusioned ex soldier from the losing side of a civil war, and now leads a life of petty crime, but always upholding his own values.. think of a Hans Solo for today.. He and his motley crew are sheltering a woman and her brother from the Alliance.  However, the secrets the woman holds turn out to bring the entire crew to face ultimate sacrifices and choices as to what is important to them. <br />Some of the character arcs are surprising, but once over the surprise / shock, they are all fitting.  The effects, the photography, the music, all are satisfyingly big screen, while making us enjoy everything we loved on the small screen. <br />Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau deserve to be go on to big things after these fine performances.. but I can't help hoping there is some contact somewhere that says they will do more adventures on Serenity!
1563894696|5.0|Tim Sale and Jeph Loeb are best known for exploring the early years of superheroes--they've covered the Hulk, Spider-Man, Daredevil and Superman, with fantastic results. However, BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN remains not just their best collaberative effort, but also one of the best superhero stories of its decade.<br /><br />LONG HALLOWEEN is a sequel of sorts to Frank MIller's BATMAN: YEAR ONE, but neither Loeb or Sale seemed pre-occupied with re-hashing that tale. LONG HALLOWEEN is gritty, all right, but more in the vein of classic 30s gangster films than Miller's \\"Dirty Harry\\" approach.<br /><br />This book primarily focuses on Batman's developing relationship with Commisioner Gordon and then-DA Harvey Dent as they try to take down the Falcone crime family. This overlaps with a murder mystery that seems to lead back to Calendar Man, an uber-lame Silver Age Batman foe who gets a Hannibal Lecter makeover.<br /><br />Like Loeb's over works, including HUSH, THE LONG HALLOWEEN is very easy to pick up and read, whether you've followed Batman's comic book history or not. Heck, you don't even have to read YEAR ONE to enjoy this book--its a very self-contained piece, and because of that LONG HALLOWEEN is highly accessible. However, if you are a Batman enthusiant, keep an eye out for appearces by nearly every villian Batman has ever encountered, from Selina Kyle to the Joker to Solomon Grundy.<br /><br />I cannot suggest this book highly enough--anyone who likes graphic novels will love THE LONG HALLOWEEN. And when you're done, check out Loeb and Sale's superb follow-up, DARK VICTORY.
B000BJS4SU|3.0|A blue blooded suburban kid from Connecticut will never be able to truly sing the blues. That's just the way it is. Mayer does well with this effort, and it truly is a good album. But he falls just a bit short, and it is due to the fact that the blues is something you are born into and it resides somewhere in your soul. It is a craft honed by years of life experience. The blues are a culture and a way of approaching life.<br /><br />That being said I give it four stars. No, I think I will give it three. I'm a big John Mayer fan, and his musical genius still shines through. In fact, I applaud this \\"try.\\" It shows he has range, even if he falls just a bit short of the heart and soul of blues. Actually, I think that Mayer is quite close. His introspective and sometimes haunting lyrics are in the same neighborhood of the blues. But they are just a bit too introspective. The blues are the expression of life when life hits you like a Mack truck. The blues tend to just say it straight. You don't bother with too much introspection when you just got hit by the Mack truck of human experience!<br /><br />Mayer's strengths as a musician, however, are evident on this album. And if you enjoy Mayer's music as I do then you will appreciate the redo of \\"Something's Missing.\\" It's good. Also a highlight for me was \\"I Got a Woman.\\" That's one of my fav tunes and Mayer does it justice, as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />John Mayer is a brooding, Gen-X poet. What happens when an egocentric northeastern kid collides with the blues. Well, that's what you get on this album. I am glad I purchased it. It is interesting and a bit different than the norm. Definitely worth four stars....er, well, three stars....
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Wow! People are quite worked up over Incubus' latest release, \\"Light Grenades.\\" And while many Incubus fans have every right to be critical of a band they've supported for years, I think we should really be applauding the band's efforts on this one. \\"Light Grenades\\" has the potential to be Incubus' best album yet, but this is based mostly on the fact that it is as diverse as any album they've released.  <br /> <br />The album flows like a rollercoaster; \\"Quicksand\\" starts out slow and methodical, as Brandon's rolling voice resembles that of Chris Martin of Coldplay. This leads perfectly into \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off,\\" which has a pace the polar opposite of \\"Quicksand.\\" \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off,\\" begins with that characteristic guitar sound that Mike has, but once the drums roll in, you know you're getting a serious rock song. My favorite line in this song, \\"Kill your doubt with the coldest of weapons, Confidence,\\" is a blanket statement to which any listener can relate.  <br /> <br />These first two songs serve as perfect compliments. I saw Incubus at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York this week, and they opened with this sequence; the crowd is lulled in by the melodious sound of \\"Quicksand\\" and then the room feels as if it explodes with \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off.\\" It's moments like these that make music amazing... <br /> <br />The instrumental introduction to \\"Dig\\" is dreamy and filled with emotion, and the lyrics capture the sound well. The multiple uses of the actual word \\"dig\\" give the song more lyrical depth. Listen to the song again, you will see what I mean.  <br /> <br />Each song offers something different. \\"Anna-Molly\\" is this album's equivalent of \\"Megalomaniac;\\" loud and defiant, but strong enough to make a point. The sequence and placement of \\"Earth to Bella\\" (Parts I & II) are reminiscent of old fashioned records that would begin and end with a certain melody to represent the album coming full-circle. Pearl Jam did the same with \\"Ten,\\" in case you're looking for a modern equivalent. <br /> <br />\\"Oil and Water\\" and \\"Diamonds and Coal\\" are a little too similar (in both sound and lyrics) to be placed back-to-back on the album, which is one of my few criticisms. Each song, on its own, is outstanding, particularly the arrangement of the lyrics in \\"Oil and Water.\\" They truly read like poetry, as the rhyme scheme permeates throughout the song, within lines, as opposed to only at the ends of sentences. <br /> <br />\\"Rogues\\" is a classic Incubus song that has elements of both \\"Pardon Me\\" and \\"Sick Sad Little World.\\" It starts out at a blitzing pace and you really have to focus to understand the lyrics, but the lyrics are what make the song. I love this song because of the statement it makes about society; about not conforming to accepted norms and truly appreciating those who take a stand.  <br /> <br />I am glad that so many people are critical of this album, as it shows such high standards of good music. There have been a number of reviewers saying that they are waiting for this album to grow on them, and I agree with them %100. I owned this cd the day it came out, and could barely listen to it for a month and a half without getting upset and feeling like Incubus let us down. I was worried that it would not grow on me and, like others, wondered if Incubus had reached its peak. Thank God this is not the case.  <br /> <br />\\"Light Grenades\\" is just a new exploration into music by a band that predicates itself on being diverse and unique. If you want the same music over and over, just listen to \\"Make Yourself\\" again. Look at their progression, from \\"Make Yourself\\" to \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.,\\" and then from \\"Morning View\\" to \\"A Crow Left of the Murder.\\" Throw \\"Fungus Amongus\\" in there and you tell me, what is Incubus' \\"sound?\\" I applaud their fearlessness in making new music, and say thank you for being different, if even from themselves. <br />
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Soulful isn't a strong enough word to describe how complete Paolo's singing is.  His voice is so honest it's impossible not to hear the stories of his experiences behind his songs.  These are songs that you'll be thankful to have lingering with you in the back of your mind all day.   <br /> <br />The ones playing in my mind right now: These Streets and Last Request.  I haven't found a new artist that I've liked this much in a long time.

B00005Q4ED|1.0|Maybe it's just because of the horrific DVD edit but I really don't understand why other reviewers are calling this a \\"gem\\".  I had no idea why Jane would fall in love with this Rochester (Maybe because she's in her 40's?).  Maybe all those scenes got cut out.  This St. John Rivers doesn't strike me as an idealistic man of God, he acts crazed and fanatical!  York is too old and too pretty.  Scott is at least old and grouchy but he does poorly looking tortured.  The scene at the end is puzzling, Scott as Rochester is flippant and emotionless (maybe he used up his histrionics in the rest of the movie)  There are so many good versions of this, this one seems like a waste of time.
0375701427|5.0|When I read books as &#34;literature,&#34; I like to return in my mind to my student days & Dr. Eileen Cohen's (PhD, head of the English Department at St. Joseph's University, betimes) response to a student's question - what will students in this class on The Novel in English be studying 20 years from now?  Now was 1974.  In 1974, Dr. Cohen suggested that the novels of ideas, of John Foulkes for example (&#34;The Magus&#34;, &#34;The French Lieutenant's Woman&#34;, etc.) had legs.  Frankly, so far we have not seen Foulkes become the flavor of a month or year or decade, although I did so love his books.  Perhaps now that he's dead & gone we'll see a resurgence of interest in his books.  Had we been 25 years or so further along in the game, however, I feel sure that Dr. Cohen would have included certain of the novels of Philip Roth in her list, & added some of the other novels on the NYT list of Best Books of the last 25 Years (pub May 2006) - although I feel sure she would not have fallen for all of them - &#34;Beloved&#34; is no match for many other books on that list, & I find myself scratching my head over &#34;Beloved&#34; as the overwhelming choice as the favorite.  But I know with certainty that Dr. Cohen would have included this wonderful book by Philip Roth, &#34;American Pastoral&#34;, among her best of the last 25 years.  This book works on too many levels to count.  Character development, narrative, dialog, structure - it never puts a foot wrong.  A monumental achievement.  It is a book to be included on virtually ANY list of The Best - of the last 25, 50, or even 100 years - of American literary accomplishment.  Although the book has been criticized for being over-long, I found that it took Roth the right amount of time to establish that even the best among us - & the Swede IS the best among us - is ill-equipped to deal with chaos.  And chaos is the book's theme.  Read it & rejoice in it.  It's not often that we see a work of genius, & truly this is one.e. <br /> <br />
032147404X|4.0|Overall this is a very good digital photography book. Kelby's sense of humor is quirky, and even perhaps a little annoying in some areas, but overall it adds to the readability of the book.<br /><br />The one thing I found frustrating was that most of the web links are useless.  I understand he can't control the outside links, like [...] which has apparently decided that sharing some of their gallery might deter us from actually buying their guides, but I wasn't even able to get to  [...]<br /><br />Otherwise, a pretty good, readable book on digital photography.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|My wife is a big fan and we've seen Norah a couple of times in concert... I'm really regretting buying this, as we both hate it. <br /> <br />A few of the songs are making none to subtle jabs at Bush, which I find grating and tired. The guy has like a 20% approval rating (ie. we get it, really!) Its been done before by too many artists and brings nothing to the music. If you happen to be one of the few remaining George W. Bush fans, don't worry, NJ is basically mumbling through the whole CD, so its unlikely that you'll understand what she's saying anyway. <br /> <br />Hopefully buyers will ignore this review when I put our CD up for sale.
B00069FLC2|5.0|I've been a Shad's fan for over 40 years and deplored the fact that the US was the only place in the universe that had never heard of them.

(I also have a Fiesta Red Stratocaster and the white 40th anniversary Hank Marvin Burns (also used in the concert)). The DVD is just beautifully recorded and filmed; the cuts sound very close to the originals, quite a feat for a live concert. Hank is at his best. A must see! <br />

1594200823|5.0|I bought both his books, and now regret buying the Botany of Desire--that book is more of a whimsical discussion of the relation between four plants and humans, while this one is a deeper learning experience that is focused on sustainability.  There are a number of gems that I noted down.<br /><br />In something of a play on words and meaning, the author opens by noting that we have a national eating disorder because we lack a culture that places eating in a proper frame of reference where time spent preparing and enjoying food is valued, and then seques into how damaging to the environment, and to ourselves, are monocultures.  At many points through the book the author documents how industrialized foods are less nutricious, more harmful to the human body, and more wasteful of the earth's resources, than organic foods.<br /><br />The book is especially dramatic and deeply documented with reference to the bastardization of corn from something delicious for humans, to something that is not edible by humans but used to create a machine line for manufactured foods that can be transported great distances.  The whole story of corn as the foundation for abusing cows, chickens, and other animals is extremely well told here, and shocking.  It stunned me, for example, to read about Iowa as an agricultural \\"desert,\\" whose farms cannot support families, only inedible corn destined for beef factories.<br /><br />As the author notes, the mutation of corn pushed the animals off the local farms and into a factory farm system.  The author does not emphasize animal cruelty but that comes across clearly.  Animals are grown in confined spaces, and drugs combined with forced feeding take an animal from 80 lbs to 1,100 lbs in 14 months, at which point they are killed.<br /><br />Side notes on how beaks are cut off chickens to keep them from hurting another another in conditions that make gulags look like country clubs, are reguarly put forward, and very troubling.<br /><br />The manner in which our mutant agriculture leads to obesity can be illustrated by the author's showing that corn fed beef is \\"marbled\\" with fat, and cleverly sold as a feature rather than the flaw that it is.<br /><br />Processed food wastes energy.  Later on in the book the author stresses that grass farming is the fastest way to harness the free renewable power of the sun.<br /><br />On pages 130-131 he constrasts the two competing systems:<br /><br />He constrasts industrial vs. pastoral; annual vs. perennial; monoculture vs. polyculture; fossil energy vs. solar energy; global market vs. local market; specialized vs. diversified; mechanical vs. biological; imported fertility vs. local fertility; and myriad inputs including fertilizer and chemicals, vs. chicken feed.<br /><br />I learn that industrialized organic farming is just as fuel and corn consumptive as industrialized chemical farming.<br /><br />The author affirms the productivity of local farms, while pointing out that it is the transaction and scaling costs that kill the family famr.<br /><br />He paints an attractive picture of natural farms as not needing machines, chemicals, fertilizers, and so on, because they manage natural complexity is a way that produces balance, nutrition, productivity, and profit.  Localized food is natural.<br /><br />Chefs get a great deal of credit for helping localized farms survive, as they give testimony with their buying, of how much better the localized product are from the one size fits all drugged up factory foods.<br /><br />I recommend [[ASIN:0887307043 The Ecology of Commerce]] or [[ASIN:0316353000 Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]] in addition to this book, and also [[ASIN:0262700840 Pandora's Poison: Chlorine, Health, and a New Environmental Strategy]] the latter on our chlorine-based industry.  I do not recommend the [[ASIN:0375760393 The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World]] unless you are interested in the spirit of the plant rather than the stabilization of the planet.<br /><br />See also [[ASIN:0345373669 Diet for a Small Planet]] and [[ASIN:1585422371 Hope's Edge: The Next Diet for a Small Planet]]IN:1585422371 Hope's Edge: The Next Diet for a Small Planet]]

078322947X|5.0|I saw this film in theater in when it was first released in 1977 and knew right away it was something special.  The first part of the film is a bit disconnected but sets the context for the story.  Four men have run afoul of either the law or powerful people and must flee--by some quirk of fate they all end up broke and desperate in the same godforsaken tropical hell-hole.  Their only of chance escape is to undertake a well-paid but extremely dangerous, almost suicidal, driving mission--they must transport unstable dynamite over primitive mountain roads to blow out an oil well fire deep in the jungle.  They are driving rehabbed 2 1/2 -ton army-surplus trucks, one of which is named Sorcerer (hence the title of the film).  The actual journey, filled with all sorts of obstacles and risks, is the heart of the film.  A camera mounted near the front wheel gives you a view into the canyon as the tire skirts the edge of a sheer drop-off, knocking rocks into the void.  The scene where they have to cross a raging river in a torrential rainstorm on a flimsy rope and wood bridge is one of the most riveting and suspenseful I've seen in any film.  Roy Scheider does a great job portraying the driven energy of his character and is clearly the star here. <br /> <br />The dark quality of the film is greatly enhanced by Tangerine Dream's ominous and menacing soundtrack.  I'd never heard of Tangerine Dream before seing this film but became an instant fan.  Definitely consider getting the soundtrack CD also. <br /> <br />This is one my all-time favorite films and I've always wondered why it has remained so little-known.  If you're a fan of the noir/suspense genre you'll like this one.

0684847817|5.0|Like several others, I bought the book for the illustrations.  They are not disappointing.  There are color illustrations and pencil sketch illustrations in quantity.  What I did not expect was a dose of depth psychology.  Faeries are manifestations, according to the author, of unconscious aspects of a person.  Faeries are not purely good or purely bad.  A Little Panic, who is a cute boy-goat hybrid, causes confusion and free-floating anxiety but also reminds one s/he is part of nature.  By accepting and befriending faeries in both their good and bad aspects, one has a easier time of it.  Faeries ignored will do all sorts of things and it is best to see to it the faeries do not have to work as hard to get one's attention.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Ruth Wilson made an excellent Jane Eyre.  She gives new depth to the character and truly shows the emotions that Jane is feeling throughout the story.  The flashback scenes added a lot to the movie and gave a clear picture of the characters' deep feelings.  Great movie!
B00004UFTU|5.0|This album is one of the best albums of the 80's (and, in my opionion, Marillion's best).  Marillion was one of a handful of British groups that took up the progressive rock style when all the classic bands (Genesis, Yes, Tull, etc.) were going for more of a mainstream rock sound.  What this means is you get an album of epic songs (7 minute average rather than 3), poetic lyrics, musical ambition, and fantastic keyboard playing.   <br />     Although accused of \\"sounding too much like early Genesis\\", Marillion actually sounds less like them than most of the other neo-prog bands.  First of all, Marillion has a strong, punchy, 80's sound that is a nice variant on the prog theme - at times they're even almost heavy metal (for the 80's, Marillion and Iron Maiden seemed to be your best bet for nice, melodic, energetic instrumental passages), although the keyboard-rich sound gives them a different sound than metal.  Lead singer Fish reminds one of early 70's Peter Gabriel, but Fish is a much stronger singer - savage and over-the-top, with florid rolled \\"r\\"s (he kind of reminds me of Van Der Graaf Generator's singer Peter Hammill, too).  Unfortunately, Fish toned down his singing soon after this album, but it was fantastic here and (to a lesser degree) on \\"Fugazi\\".  Guitarist Steve Rothery is more reminiscent of Pink Floyd's David Gilmore than Genesis's Steve Hackett, he has that lovely feel that really sets him above many others.  The lyrics are also distinctive - Fish's topics are more heavy metal than prog (drugs, sex/romance, etc.), but his lyric writing is much more florid and poetic than any metal singer (excepting maybe Fates Warning's John Arch).   <br />     My only caveat is, either buy the 2-disc version or pick up \\"B-sides themselves\\", because there's almost a whole album of great songs you'll miss out on from this era of the band if you don't (\\"Three Boats Down From the Candy\\", \\"Market Square Heroes\\", and the 20-minute epic \\"Grendel\\" are all as top-notch as thesongs on this disc).   <br />     Marillion's next CD (\\"Fugazi\\") is nearly as good, but after that they never really achieved this sound again - they lost a lot of the energy and edge of this CD, tending towards a mellower, more rambling sound reminiscent of later Pink Floyd, U2, and alternative rock (although with  some brilliant stuff on every album, especially \\"Anoraknophobia\\").
B00005JOCS|5.0|\\"Dreamgirls\\" is excellent! The performances led by Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx (Best Actor for his performance as Ray Charles in \\"Ray\\" (2004), Beyonce Knowles and Academy Award nominee Eddie Murphy (Best Supporting Actor) and Jennifer Hudson (Academy Award Winner for Best Supporting Actress) are excellent. The directing by Bill Condon (who also directed \\"Kinsey\\" (2004) is excellent. The screenplay by Condon (based on the book by Tom Eyen) is excellent. The music by Henry Krieger is excellent. The cinematography by Tobias A. Schliessler (who also did the cinematography to \\"Friday Night Lights\\" (2004) is excellent! The film editing by Virginia Katz (who also did the film editing to \\"Kinsey\\") is excellent. The casting by Debra Zane (who also did the casting to the upcoming \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" (2007) is excellent. The production design by John Myhre (Two-time Oscar winner for his work on \\"Chicago\\" (2002) & \\"Memoirs Of A Geisha\\" (2005), also nominated for his work on this movie) is excellent. The art direction by Tomas Voth is excellent. The set decoration by Nancy Haigh (Oscar winner for her work on \\"Bugsy\\" (1991), also nominated for her work on this movie) is excellent. The costume design by Sharen Davis (who was Oscar nominated for her work on \\"Ray\\" & this movie, also did the costume design to \\"The Pursuit Of Happyness\\" (2006) is excellent. This is an excellent musical that is in lines of \\"Chicago\\".
B00004W3L3|3.0|I got into Marillion around 1999 and was getting big into progressive rock at that time.  I got the first 2 (\\"Script for a Jester's Tear\\" and \\"Fugazi\\") before this one and loved them.  With this one, I was just a little underwhelmed.  It's not bad, but it's mostly not brilliant either (whereas almost all of the first Fish and about 1/2 of Fugazi still blow me away) - most of it, although it may have the wandering-connected song structures and odd meters of progressive rock, just kind of sounds like run of the mill 80's pop to me.  Overall it's relatively pleasant, with some pretty moments (Steve Rothery has some nice guitar playing here, as elsewhere), but doesn't have the bite of the early Fish albums or the subtle, underlying feeling that marks the best of their later (Steve Hogarth-fronted) albums.  I know a lot of people love this CD, and I enjoy it, but I would recommend \\"Script for a Jester's Tear\\" or \\"Anaraknophobia\\" (which has a late 1990's \\"alternative\\" sound, but is still a fantastic piece of musical art) for someone interested in this band at their best.

B000LE1GVW|4.0|The first time I heard \\"Last Request\\" was online and I immediately visited Paolo Nutini's website to hear more. Two songs later, I was on Amazon pre-ordering his cd. I received it last week and I am even more impressed than I was initially! In addition to \\"Last Request\\", \\"Million Faces\\", and \\"Loving You\\" are absolute gems. His voice...so soulful and yet slightly similar to Gavin De Graw's during a bluesy moment or even Cat Stevens, can't nail it down. Doesn't matter, this is a great cd. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because I wish there were more than 10 songs on it. Enjoy!

1594200440|4.0|Perhaps I'm just nuts, but to me this wonderful little tale is not about family relations or sex among the elderly. No...this is a modern day interpretation of the mythological Greek goddess Demeter, who ruled the harvest and taught man to reap and store grain. Demeter is, of course, Ludmilla, the now deceased mother who causes everything to grow and be fruitful. She even goes to Hades (a punishment in a wartime work camp) with her daughter just as Demeter rescued her daughter Prosephene from the Underworld. Our Demeter is married to technology, an uneasy union, that. Her husband goes berzerk if he is not being guided and controlled. There's a fake Demeter, Valentina, who looks sexy and fertile but nurtures nothing. She doesn't want a union with real technology either. She wants a stove of the right color and a trendy vacuum cleaner that can't be used. Not to mention the useless cars she picks. Inserted throughout are pieces of the history of the tractor, the perfect marriage of agriculture and technology, that parallel or illuminate what's happening in our little modern-day family. The author, in fact, even winks at the reader by giving an off-stage character the name of Prosephene.The moral of the story can be left to the readers of this clever parable. I thought it was quite wonderful.

B0000028M7|5.0|Ultimately this is a very tragic album, as Layne Staley's engulfing drug addiction, a crucial aspect of \\"Dirt\\", would eventually take his life. The album also hosts a lot of other bewildering and bleak themes, such as lust, resent, isolation and even the treatment of the American Vietnam soldiers (a tribute to Jerry Cantrell's father). As a result of this gloomy and seemingly self-indulgent grasp of reality, many were quick to attack \\"Dirt\\", and pass it off as simple teenage play. I am happy to say that now, fifteen years down the line, this album is considered something of a classic, and Staley's lyrics regarded as genuine portrayals of a man on the brink.<br /><br />Aside from the overwhelming presence of Layne Staley, the other ego of this band - Jerry Cantrell - creates some of the finest music to come out of the 90's. His riffs are always infectious, fusing styles of 70s era Sabbath with 80s era mainstream metal, such as GnR (but with a much more abrasive and heavier tone). He also plays some very touching and subtle guitar melodies, displaying his excellent control of dynamics and tone. This is especially evident in the two slow burning tracks - call them ballads if you will - \\"Rooster\\" (which was about his father's bitter return from Vietnam), and \\"Down In A Hole\\", which has the best guitar playing on the album, combining fluid acoustic playing with distorted licks to complement Staley's vocal delivery.<br /><br />The one-two punch of the album depicts a rough and ready AIC, bursting out of the gates with \\"Them Bones\\" and \\"Dam That River\\". Both of these songs fashion Cantrell's bent for a catchy riff and Staley's excellent vocal melodies, combined with some confrontational lyrics. These two songs also display a sense of restraint to me, as if the band refined the hard-hitting grunge song, something their debut \\"Facelift\\" often lacked, with many songs drifting towards the five-minute mark (with the exception of the lovely opener \\"We Die Young\\" of course). Other hard-hitting grunge cuts include one of the band's best-known tracks, the sharp closer \\"Would?\\" with its soaring melodies and vocals it finishes the album in style. There really is a host of other great album tracks creating a great flow and solidity, such as the moody and revealing \\"Junkhead\\" and the anger swansong \\"Angry Chair\\".<br /><br />Alice In Chains were tragically short-lived, and albums such as this and their s/t finale show what great magnitudes they could have continued to achieve. This essential for any grunge fan, 90s rock fan, and really any fan of traditional heavy music.itting grunge cuts include one of the band's best-known tracks, the sharp closer \\"Would?\\" with its soaring melodies and vocals it finishes the album in style.

B000LC3ID8|3.0|The original \\"Saw\\" was everything a horror film should be.  It had gore both implied and explicit, twists and turns in the plot, and characters that the audience didn't particularly want to see die.  Then came along Saw II, which ramped up the gore factor considerably, and while it had its moments, it was obviously only there to make money off of the success of the original.  Now the horror genre has been graced with the third offering in the series, which is firmly in Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street territory.  The series is now officially a parody of itself, and its continued existence is only assured as long as it remains a cash cow (which it will).<br /><br />The main problem with Saw III is that Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are no longer believable villains.  They exude no sense of terror or aura of fear, as they are creatures that simply could not exist in reality.  Jigsaw has essentially become the God of the universe.  He knows every minute detail of every person's life.  He knows where everyone sleeps, how they take their coffee, how long it takes them to drive to work, when the best time to break into their house to plant cameras would be, how their relationships with their spouses and children are, what color underwear they buy, etc.  Both Jigsaw and Amanda are also expert locksmiths, pharmacists, and engineers.  With no funds at all, they can craft any torture device of any size in minimal time.  These devices are also so expertly crafted that they can be deactivated and removed with one small padlock, even if the device is fully covering a person's entire body.  These villains are no longer scary because there is obviously no hope of survival at all.  No matter how physically strong or prepared a person is, they cannot avoid being captured by Jigsaw, and they have no chance of escaping his traps alive.<br /><br />Jigsaw is portrayed as a sort of avenging angel in this movie.  Out of all the characters, he is the most rational and detached from emotion.  The overall tone of the movie almost implies that he is correct and that everyone should just submit to his will and change their lives according to his system of beliefs.  The problem with this logic is that if Jigsaw's beliefs are applied to his own life, he should be the one stuck in a deadly trap.  His whole point in capturing and torturing people is to show them that they have been wasting their lives and they need to start living and being happy with their lot.  He states that one character was chosen because she spends her life doing nothing but trying to save the dead, while her family life is dying.  However, this exact same sentence could be applied to Jigsaw.  He spends his life trying to save others from emotional death, and this obsession has obviously killed him inside.<br /><br />Even with all these problems, Saw III does have some merit.  The gore in this entry of the series is simply out of control, and exceedingly well done.  The tone of the gore has become even more sadistic than in Saw II.  An early scene involving chains that have been run through a man's flesh, including his jaw, is absolutely stunning.  Pretty much everyone will cringe or look away when he starts ripping the chains out of himself.  The final major trap, dubbed \\"the rack\\", is one of the most diabolical devices put on film in recent memory.  The script is also better than anticipated, and it neatly brings the series full circle, connecting several events that didn't appear to be connected before.<br /><br />The parallels between Friday the 13th and Saw are occurring with increasing frequency.  Jigsaw and Jason both kill in retribution for people not agreeing with their view of how the world should work.  While Jason punishes those who do drugs or have pre-marital sex, Jigsaw punishes those who have squandered their lives.  Both are unstoppable, invincible whirlwinds of death who can sneak up on anyone, no matter how implausible the situation.  Like every Fridaythe 13th movie ever made, even though the ending of Saw III completely ruined any option for a sequel, Saw 4 is currently in production.  Obviously Jason, I mean Jigsaw, will rise again to continue torturing those who don't agree with his world view.<br /><br />I'll be skipping that one.hough the ending of Saw III completely ruined any option for a sequel, Saw 4 is currently in production.

B000LC3ID8|2.0|Even being just a little bit better than Saw 2, number 3 should be the end of the Saw series. Jigsaw's cruel games have now about reached their creativity limits. The deadly traps were the only reason to watch the second episode, but the story has now become too hard to believe.  <br />How have all these brilliant sadistic traps been constructed by a 70 year old guy and his small sized assistent Amanda? How the hell is such a couple capable in kidnapping grown men? Shame the great Saw movie has been turned from cult horror movie into a display of sadism. (SARR)

0887307280|3.0|This book has a high rating because it really does contain a couple very powerful ideas for the small business owner.  <br /> <br />My problem with this book is that those ideas could be presented in about 4 or 5 chapters, maximum. A fair portion of the 18 chapters of this book is pure fluff. Especially toward the end, where some of the chapters were complete zeroes. I suppose the author had to pad it out for the publisher to make it look like a serious business book. Furthermore, this author has what I'd call a high word-to-data ratio. I've read few books where so many words are used to say so little.  <br /> <br />Probably worth reading for the good ideas contained, but be prepared to be frustrated by all the gloss you have to wade through.

B000007MVL|5.0|In my most recent of many limited-term obsessions with Kate's music, while trying to find out more about the artist herself, I came across several references to the \\"obvious\\" \\"rushed\\" and \\"patchy\\" quality of this album, including one from Kate herself (ouch)!   <br /> <br />I could not agree less.  While I agree with the entire universe that Hounds of Love is her ultimate masterpiece, Lionheart is actually my 2nd favorite of all her albums.  It seems very consistent to me, with a very similar range and \\"vibe\\" to Never For Ever, and less stereotypically \\"60's\\" than her debut. <br /> <br />My favorite song on the album is also not ever mentioned by anyone - Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake.  Is the title too long?  Absolutely.  But the energy, variety of sonic textures and out-of-control vocals have kept this one running through my brain for at least 15 years.  But with only one exception, every song from Wow to Fullhouse to Hammer Horror is distinctive, melodic, energetic, and quinessentially Kate. <br /> <br />The only song that doesn't do anything for me is the almost title track, \\"Oh England, My Lionheart.\\"  I find it repetitive and uninventive.  If all those naysayers were talking about the song and not the album, I could see their point.  But if you like Kate's music at all, there are 9 gems to be had on this most excellent CD.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|When I first saw this film in 1993 I was very surprised to learn that it was based on a true story.  The way the movie portrayed the townspeople as all non-believers is the way it would actually be right?  This story adapted very well onto the big screen due to great writing, decent special effects, and very good acting.  These actors really did a good job on not making this movie too corny or fake.  I had kinda forgotten about this movie until it came out on dvd but after seeing it now the story really does stay with me.  The dvd transfer is very crisp and clear with great 5.1 sound.  I wish they had some special features included on the dvd.  At least a follow up on the people the movie was about.

0440180295|4.0|Vonnegut, in his introduction to this novel, explains that he thought he would be able to write about the atrocious firebombing of Dresden by allied aeroplanes on February 13 1945 (killing more people in a single night than Hiroshima) soon after he had returned from action as a young man having survived the event by being incarcerated in an underground slaughterhouse. Things didn't work out, and it was only much later 'living in easy circumstances in Cape Cod' that Vonnegut came across the ingenious presentation for the theme - show up the absurdity of war by invoking science fiction, time travel, and a phlegmatic attitude to death and the cycle of everything that goes on in this mad, loosely wired world - 'so it goes'. An anti war satire to rank alongside Catch 22, Slaughterhouse 5 is written in a plain, frank style that may not have the stylistic subtelties of great literary fiction, but brings home the truths about war, started by men, fought by babies, in a powerful and blackly comic way.
0380789035|5.0|This was an incredible novel.  Alternately scary, intriguing, funny, sexy, and just downright weird - American Gods took me to places that no novel ever had before, and I devour books.  The premise - that the \\"old\\" gods brought by explorers, colonists, slaves, and indigenous peoples to America had fallen out of favor and out of memory, so they planned an offensive against the \\"new\\" gods of America (television, radio, internet) - is an exciting one, and rich with possibilities.  The central character, Shadow, was sweet and sympathetic, and I grew to love him over the story.<br /><br />I listened to this novel on CD - nineteen of them! - and the narration was superb.  I couldn't wait to get back into my car to listen to more of the story.  This is one I wouldn't let my kids listen to, though.  It's definitely a novel for grown-ups.  But it's definitely one I'm going to add to my collection.  Neil Gaiman is a talented storyteller, and a gifted writer - and those two skills don't always go together.
0142437611|4.0|The American Dream is such an awesome, vast, teeming notion that promises so much and forgets those who are broken on its huge wheel. Tommy Wilhelm is one such man, a salesman in mid life who has lost his job, left his family and now festers in limbo, worrying, fretting with his burden in a hotel room. Everywhere he turns, he is scorned. By the mysterious Tamkin, a wild and shifty charismatic character who insists a fortune can be made easily be made by closely watching certain patterns: 'You think the Wall Street guys are so smart - geniuses? That's because most of us are psychologically afraid to think about the details.' He is, of course, a conman, who deceives Wilhelm out of the last of his money, but Wilhelm is too gullible to see this.<br /><br />Then there is his father, Dr Adler - a proud, dying, stern man who treats his son with wretched contempt when he is forced to ask for money, unfeelingly, his father emasculates Tommy's condition in phrases that cut deep in their scathing: 'You cry about being helped,' he said. 'When you thought you had to go into the service I sent a check to Margret every month. As a family man you could have had an exemption. But no? The war couldn't be fought without you and you had to get yourself drafted and be an office boy in the Pacific theater. Any clerk could have done what you did. You could find nothing better to become than a GI.' Ouch.<br /><br />All of this combines in a memorable scene towards the end of the novella, after Tommy has been humiliated by his ex wife, who holds him to his payments towards their children which he cannot afford and his father, boling with rage, rejects him entirely: 'Go away from me now. It's torture for me to look at you, you slob!'. Tommy goes out into the street: 'And the great, great crowd, the inexhaustible current of millions of every race and kind pouring out, pressing round, of ever age, of every genius, possessors of every human secret, antique and future, in every face the refinement of one particular motive or essence - I labor, I spend, I strive, I design, I love, I cling, I uphold, I give way, I envy, I long, I scorn, I die, I hide, I want.'<br /><br />Despite all the circumstances, the slings and arrows Tommy has suffered, he retains the essential human essence, the grappling with existence that Bellow stared into deeply in his work. There is something of the defiance, the glorifying human passage of Augie March, that remains, even in the most desperate, desperate circumstances.finement of one particular motive or essence - I labor, I spend, I strive, I design, I love, I cling, I uphold, I give way, I envy, I long, I scorn, I die, I hide, I want.' <br /> <br />Despite all the circumstances, the slings and arrows Tommy has suffered, he retains the essential human essence, the grappling with existence that Bellow stared into deeply in his work.

0380789035|4.0|I have eyed American Gods for quite a long time, some from my own curiosity and some from reviews and recommendations, and have always shied away from it for some reason.  Eventually, though, curiosity won and I sure am glad that it did.  Gaiman does an amazing job in bringing the various pantheons alive, although in a more roundabout way that lets the reader discover everything on their own.  The story flowed and there wasn't much that slowed it down or turned me away from it.<br /><br />Some minor complaints.  The ending is a little anti-climactic.  This has some pluses and negatives, with the pluses being the more rounded and complete story.  The negatives, well, are that you are expecting one thing, or hoping, and it never comes.  Another minor one is that there was perhaps too much dreaming and revelations in dreams and so on.  In a book about gods this is a bit more acceptable, but it seemed that every time Shadow went to sleep or nodded off he was having a dream that revealed something.<br /><br />But the complaints are minor at that as the book progressed very smoothly.  The writing is wonderful and the storyline of gods living amidst us is just fantastic.  I would definitely recommend this book and author to anyone.  In fact, I can't wait to read Anansi Boys.<br /><br />4 stars.
B0000DIXN7|4.0|Considering this artist names Busta Rhymes, Mos Def and Nas as influences, I don't see why people are so reluctant to mention her hip hop aspects. That said, this album is hot. This is an artist who's got some serious soulful sounds coming out. As has been said, a nice blend of jazz and hip hop. \\"Stronger than Me\\" is the strongest track in my opinion.  <br /> <br />But overall, if you never heard of Ms. Winehouse, believe me, she's well worth the purchase.

B00003CXIP|5.0|\\"Stand By Me\\" is a classic coming of age movie about growing up and friendship and the pain of disillusionment when the adults you depend upon let you down. Highly recommended.    In this review I'll focus mostly on the relationship between the movie and the Stephen King novella it is based on, and the DVD extra material that closes the ring.    The movie \\"Stand By Me\\" was made in 1986. It is based on a novella published in 1982 and the story takes place in 1959 (movie) or 1960 (novella). But the story is timeless - the conflicts and the difficult transition from child to adult apply to every generation.    There is a lot of trivia (pop songs, slang expressions, TV shows, etc.) from 1959/1960 in the movie and the novella, but this doesn't really anchor the story to that era. Every generation has it's own trivia that is very important to that generation.  But today's generation can smile at the trivia of 47 years ago and still see the parallels between that trivia and their (to them) much more wonderful trivia.    The movie is based on a novella by Stephen King called \\"The Body\\". This is one of Stephen King's best stories, and is well worth reading or, if you like audio books, listening to. The audio version lasts almost six hours and is read by Frank Muller. Highly recommended. If you'd prefer to read the story yourself then you should buy the book \\"Different Seasons\\", a collection of four Stephen King novellas including \\"The Body\\".    The movie and the novella are very similar. There are, of course, many small differences, for example the town of Castle Rock has been moved from Maine to Oregon, there is more coverage of the older juvenile delinquents and less coverage of Gordie's stories and of Gordie as an adult, the place where the bloodsuckers are encountered is different, etc., etc. The biggest difference is that in the novella Chris is the main protagonist, or hero if you like, while in the movie it is Gordie. Still, this movie is truer to the written source than most movies based on books are.    So why did Rob Reiner make these changes, and what on earth did Stephen King think of them?    Here's where the magic of DVD extra material comes in. The \\"Special Edition\\" (2000) and \\"Deluxe Edition\\" (2005) DVDs both include a 35-minute documentary \\"featurette\\" called \\"Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me\\", which was made in 2000. Stephen King, Rob Reiner and all of the major actors in the movie (except River Phoenix, who died in 1993) participate.    In this documentary film Rob Reiner tells that he identified personally more with Gordie than Chris, and therefore decided to make the movie Gordie's story. And Stephen King says that he respected Rob Reiner's decision and thinks that \\"Stand By Me\\" was the first movie adaptation of his work that really fulfilled the spirit of the story.    Stephen King also says that many of the things that happen in \\"The Body\\" and in \\"Stand By Me\\" are things he experienced himself in his childhood. This makes the story somewhat autobiographical, with Gordie being in some ways the young Stephen King. In the novella \\"The Body\\" this is quite pronounced in that an adult Gordie is telling the story in the first person, and also tells how he's now become a successful writer of horror books.    So the bottom line is, if you like the movie then read or listen to the novella. And after you've read the novella and seen the movie, check out the DVD featurette that ties them together.

0064430227|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite children's books. I remember vividly reading this book as a child. I must have read it a hundred times, and it still makes me smile when I read it today. It is the story of Harold, a boy with an extraordinary imagination. Harold creates the world around him with a purple crayon. He leaves his room one night and goes on an adventure led by his imagination and a crayon. The illustrations are so simple, yet capture the imagination of a child so well. I got this book for Christmas from my sister and was so happy to have it again. I lost my original copy when my house flooded in 1995. This is definitely one that I will hold on to for my children one day. It's one of those classics that will always remain relevant.

For those of us who were fortunate to see the film in the cinema, we were lucky to experience something everybody else had missed in the movie experience. The film is beautifully shot, written, and acted. I don't know what people expected but I read the book long before seeing the film. It is a visual masterpiece! You feel like you are there in war with the cast members. Ryan Phillipe was fine as James Bradley, the mortician, whose son would write about the picture. Adam Beach was unforgettable as Ira Hayes, the Native American soldier, who was so traumatized by the war experience that he died only years later. The actor who played Rene Gagnon also did a superb job and was my favorite. Melanie Lynskey had a small role as his wife. Myra Turley also had her best performance to date as a soldier's mother as did Judith Ivey. First, the film was adapted from the book and didn't lose that touch that the author had allowed us to see. The movie recreated a world that most of us didn't live through. The film allowed us to see and appreciate what three ordinary men went through. They detailed about the tour of the flag raisers as celebrities and heroes rather than ordinary people. I remember Rene calling people for a job. Ira giving a speech at a Native Americans Congress. James probably had put that part of his life behind him. You have to remember that James, Ira, and Rene did not want to be part of the campaign for war bonds. Ira was the most resistant and his life was the most tragic. The film does not go into Ira's family background or the losses of his siblings. It was painful watching a car stop with a family who took a photo with Ira in the fields. Ira had the most guilt over the war. Rene and James had moved on with their lives and married but the legacy of a photo that changed American attitude towards a war that most of us are connected to whether we like it or not. This film was released in movie theaters as the photographer Joe Rosenthal died. I hoped that he saw it and gave it his blessing. Still, I thought it would be a shoe-in for the Oscars but I guess people are just put off by war even one that happened years ago.
B00001X591|5.0|To begin I would like to refer you to the review above by David Hurwitz, the top reviewer from classics today, I know he is good because I seldom disagree. This is a fine performance of Albinoni's Opus 9, 4 concertos for violin, 4 for oboe and 4 for 2 oboes. They are not concertos for a virtuoso soloist, rather they are concertos for oboe with orchestra, the music flows gently and beautifully. I do not find the violin concertos as interesting as the oboe because the violin blends with the string orchestra a little too well, whereas the oboe has a very different voice. (I could suggest that the violin concertos might be arranged for oboe or flute ?) I enjoyed comparing this recording with the modern instrument one by I Musici and Heinz Holliger from the mid 1960s, I Musici was the best chamber orchestra for baroque, and Hollinger was the best oboist, so it was the best at the time, and still sounds pretty good. This recording with period instruments is so different, the sound is not harsh, the result of the lower pitch, 415hz, and the gut strings, the music sounds serene and easy so that it seems slower, but the timings are much the same. In short, this is a very good baroque performance. <br />An interesting aside; Alfredo Bernadini, the second oboist, made his own oboe !
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I absolutely love this guy.  He is incredible, his voice as well as his songs are so soulful. You have to buy this albumn, you will not be dissapointed!!!
B000LC3ID8|1.0|This is not horror by any stretch of the imagination. This is pathetic, repulsive gore that was not the least bit scary to me. Film makers in this country have lost sight as to what constitutes horror. We are far behind the rest of the world where this film concept is concerned.<br /><br />This garbage is made for one reason only; kids shell up money and think this is entertainment. This film is boring, dull, gruesome, cruel and extremely depressing. When I was younger I remember leaving theaters after some of the great horror movies of the day laughing from the good fright experience those movies provided. This is not the case anymore. Blood, blood, blood and more blood combined with the sickest ways imaginable to torture and kill people is NOT entertainment, it is NOT horror. It is trash.<br /><br />The first Saw was...eh...ok. The second was purely stupid. The third one is pure garbage. Thankfully I haven't had to shell over one red cent to see any of these pieces of junk. But three is my limit. I will not subject myself to parts 4, 5, 6 and however many they will make to sucker the movie going public in the future. This is what you get when you have no standards and no expectations. Are the American movie going public, young  and old, so properly dumbed down and willing to give up their money for putrid garbage such as this? Sadly, yes. What a tragic shame.<br /><br />0 stars.
0805209999|5.0|Kafka's writing is like taking a trip into the most terrifying nightmare you have ever experienced.. He was so concious of the guilt that dominated the personality of modern man.. There is always someone watching always someone observing your every move - and to take it further there is a man watching that man who is watching you and so on infinitely.. This trial of man kind is the symptom of a successful marketing economy and its greatest disease to the nature of humanity..<br /><br />K is a man who does not know what he did wrong or who accusses him - it appears that the beaurocratic chain is stretched so far that there is no direct access to the facts.. (think of Kafka's own occupation - and it becomes evident why his writing focuses so much on beaurocracy).. But, like 'the stranger' by albert camus, 'the trial' seems to address the spiritual sickness of modern man.. To think of Kafka as a spiritual writer seems almost preposterous - but I am not talking of the ordinary judeao-christian meaning of the word.. Kafka's world is a world where no man knows himself let alone his neighbor.. He can't see the tree for all of its leaves - he is blind and inept..<br /><br />'the trial' hits like a ton of bricks and is a modern classic.. Another book you should read if you like 'the triral' is 'the castle' which I believe is even more dream-like.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Like a lot of people, I thought that a powerpoint lecture by Al Gore would be a snoozefest. When I first saw the trailer to 'An Inconvenient Truth', I laughed at the way the movie was hyped, yet was nothing more than a lecture by Gore.<br /><br />Gore's lecture was absolutely amazing. He painted a clear picture of the global warming problem in an apolitical manner. The facts backed up by imagery and research were very convincing that we are in danger.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that 'An Inconvenient Truth' will not reach a wide audience, or reach those that should see it the most. Gore is a political creature, and therefore he will not reach about 50% of the population. This presentation is an important one that all should see, regardless of political preference.
B000FILW86|5.0|They sound fresh as ever with cathcy tunes, powerful riffs, great lyrics and awesome singing. Never tired of listening it. These vets surely have a lot to teach to the mediocre kids wanna-be-rock-stars we've seen popping up all throughout this decade. If you like excellent straight-forward rock-n-roll this CD is for you. Buy It!!!
0671891634|5.0|Lynch makes lots of good points.  One of them is as a small investor you can buy into thinly traded stocks on the way up, such as APCC in the early days. <br /> <br />Big funds simply can't get enough stock to make it \\"worthwhile,\\" an interesting point, usually overlooked by the pros in their writing.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Alfred Molina controls and squeezes his tiny French village with a tight net built on his repressed frustrations and disappointments.  What makes this film so endearing and simultaneously tense is that Molina's motives seem so irrational until the aforementioned is revealed to the viewer. Unfortunately for him, and as a disguised blessing to the inhabitants, Juliette Binoche breezes into this little place and brings \\"paganism\\" in the form of spirit, beauty, compassion, and delicious food that warms the senses and the citizens.  This simple act slowly loosens Mayor Molina's religious and puritanical grip on this town, to his absolute fury. The final \\"showdown\\" occurs when he realizes that his own closeted will is slowly draining away his life and the joy that he has allowed to elude him. The power of chocolate..who would have thought that a little taste would have been his undoing?  This is a lovely film.  Movies do not have to be Oscar material, or drowning in special effects to be sublime or memorable.  Chocolat is both.
0307276902|3.0|The three stars I gave this book is the same I would have gave it before James was \\"outted\\" so to speak about not being totally truthful about the events in this book. Truth or not honestly it was a pretty good read to me. Yes, the lies that he has been exposed of do take away from reader's who haven't read it and for those of us who have, but,due to the fact I read it before al that came about I didn't wanna write a James Bashing review. Now that you know the truth (so to speak) I don't have to reccomend this one to you...the choice is yours.
B00004TWZF|5.0|In Europe we consider this movie \\" the movie of a generation\\"...when it came out, it stayed in theater something like 4 or 5 month !! And it came out a second time with a longer version. In both versions we always had the same ending...so I'm pretty much disappointed (but not surprised) to read that in US you had a kind of \\"happy ending\\".  <br />Anyway, the music scored by Eric Serra, the man who did the soundtrack from every Besson movies by the way, is magnificent. This movie ranks in my top five, the best french movie in my opinion. To see this movie in a theater is one of the most beautiful experience...!  <br />If you like Luc Besson, there's actually two movies you MUST get : \\"SUBWAY\\" and \\"NIKITA\\" (not the one with Bridget Fonda...but with Anne Parrillaud).
0786852550|5.0|\\"The temperature of the room dropped fast. Ice formed on the curtains and crusted thickly around the lights in the ceiling.\\" Those are the first two sentences  of this incredible fantasy book. This book takes place in London, where a boy named Nathaniel steals a magician's(Simon Lovelace) most prized possession(The Amulet of Samarkand) to get back at Simon for embarrassing him. He summons Bartimaeus, a quick-witted djinni, to do his work, however Nathaniel quickly finds himself entangled in a mess that could cost him his life, as well as other's lives. What will he do?? <br /> The Amulet of Samarkand is tops on my list because it was a very fast-paced, page-turning book. Jonathan Stroud flip-flops between Nathaniel and Bartimaeus to make for a very interesting book. I loved the way he did it. Bartimaeus's \\"sharp tongue\\" definitely gives plenty of humor to the book. Anyone from age 11 and beyond will really enjoy this book. The humor is incredible and the plot will keep you on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend The Amulet of Samarkand!
6305327041|1.0|I'm not usually one to be critical of a thing and not back it with balanced insightful information, but I wasted enough of my life with this movie to go that deep. I would rather have spend the 90 minutes hammering my fingertips flats with a ball peen hammer. Just don't do it. It's not funny no matter your \\"mindset\\" or \\"frame of reference\\".
B000M5AJQS|3.0|For sure only the cast and famous director made this movie somehow successful, otherwise the script was not original and reminded me of one of the old western in which heroes & villains all end up dead.acting of jack nicoulson was over exaggerated and for sure was not <br />one his best.I was just waiting for the movie to end asap.
B000002LR6|5.0|If you are a fan of industrial metal and you don't own this CD, you need to get it right now.  I personally rank this behind \\"Land of Rape and Honey\\" and before \\"Mind...\\" in terms of favorites.  If you have heard anything from Ministry's last 2 CD's, I can pretty much guarantee that you'll love this CD. <br /> <br />Starting with NWO, the music is hard and heavy and never lets up.  Even the last two songs, which traditionally for Ministry were a bit on the experimental side, are pretty dark and foreboding.  If you like Nine Inch Nails but wish ole Trent was a bit heavier with the music you probably would like this.  It's like taking heavy metal music and adding various samples from movies and television and mixing it in a blender.  Only you're listening to it while the blender is on.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|watching this movie gives me the feeling that script writers are realy running out of good any real good ideas. this movie was too much ado about, well the fact that a japanese hunter gave a rifle <br />to his guide it was not necessary to watch the whole fiasco about his spoilt teenage daughter.all one sees from kate (great actor) well, not much. just in partial coma and total spoken words by her well, not even a <br />page of script but much to much grawling and moaning. great waste of good actors like brad and kate in this very forgetable movie.
B000ION23A|5.0|A WONDERFUL animated film, The Ant Bully, brings to the screen the story of a young boy who gets bullied around by the neighborhood kids and lets off steam by harassing an ant colony in his garden.  Things become a bit more complicated when the ants get fed up and take matters into their own hands by shrinking the young boy to ant size... <br />Zach Tyler, Julia Roberts, Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all EXCELLENT! <br />In short, The Ant Bully is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Madagascar, Hoodwinked, Antz, Cars and Monsters Inc. <br />
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Yesterday I emailed my friend: \\"Are you up on Norah James' new cd \\"Not Too Late\\"? It smokes. I particularly recommend \\"Wish I Could\\", \\"Sinking Soon\\" and \\"Be My Somebody\\" but, really, the whole thing smokes for her choices of words and the musicality and instrumentation of how she employs her voice. There are some segments where you really have trouble distinguishing if its her singing or some kind of horn playing. Anyway, its good so check it out.\\" I went on Amazon to post it as a review and was somewhat surprised by what some fellow reviewers had already posted. It is a given that everyone sets or has their own criteria and, yes, I do have her earlier work to refer to. But I think its dangerous to expect the same exact result based on prior work. I think that we can expect similar effort and similar standards but that it is unrealistic to either expect or even desire exactitude or duplication. Music like all other form of creative expression is an organic process and product. As such it will vary. Also I think that when we base our judgement on a works currency or topicality we should bear in mind that most subject matter will be yesterday's news by 3 o'clock but that relevancy gets revisited on and on. So, yeah, we get the whole Bush thing and we may even be tired of it but  we are also still hearing about The Trojan Wars and love. Not to mention that I took the songs with political references to work as love songs as well so their being Bush/anti war songs didn't bother me. As for Norah Jones being depressing well, yeah, but so was Billie Holiday and there's a niche for Jones among those of us who dwell in the state of depression and pain and seek their heavens there (read your bible or Zen tomes; life's meaning is to be found in the suffering and how we deal with it). Also, I wanted to comment on one important feature of her work here and that is its ability to bring together musical genres such as western and blues and spirituals in a way where you can see their commonality.  Lastly, you have to love someone who gives everybody who worked on the cd their props as she does. She even credits the luthiers. I didn't even know what a luthier was until I read her liner notes and then looked it up. Comments like these remind us that music is a collaborative communal effort and that gives comfort in these lonely times.    So, yeah, I do still stand by my original assessment and repeat that \\"Not Too Late\\" smokes and I hope readers of these reviews give it a listen.
1573229725|5.0|The excellent BBC film-adaptation of \\"Fingersmith\\" led me to this novel. Having never read Sarah Waters, I didn't really know what to expect, except, of course, information having to do with the general plot structure.  Part of my motivation for reading the book was to help clarify some of what went on at nearly break-neck speed in the film.  It did that, and more.  Meticulously crafted and often elegantly written, I found myself scarely able to put it down. It's a story about love, obsession, greed, opportunism, delusion, deception (and their multiform vagaries)--not to mention the limitations imposed upon people by sheer fate.  Thrown together by an elaborate scheme, two young women (one, an illiterate thief; the other, a virtually imprisoned but well-read heiress) meet, become friends, then, impractically enough, fall in love.  Oddly, the literally and figuratively pent-up heiress, Maud, turns out to be the more interesting of the two.  Some of what she says in her narration about her discovery of desire through the fingersmith, Sue, is, quite frankly, startling--and beautiful.  Both are funny, compelling characters, enmeshed in circumstances beyond their comprehension (initially) and control.  The end, like the rest of the book, doesn't disappoint.  It's rather fitting, and leaves you wanting more.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Man, I love the reviews that people are cranking out.  I initially did not like this album at all except Anna Molly.  Something about the exotic beat caught my ear, everything else seemed to meld into background music.  After listening to this album for a few months, it seemed to click the direction they are heading with this album.  I might even brave enough to say that this is my favorite Incubus album.  Rock on!
B000I5X81K|5.0|This is a wonderful album. In it, Josh is expanding his work.  I love hearing his higher range, and there is that gorgeous falsetto.  Josh already did the foreign-language classical stuff...that starts to sound all the same after a while.  But Josh is mixing it up on this CD, and I love it.  My favorites are In Her Eyes, which has a cool, complex groove, Lullaby, which gives me chills, backed up the way it is by Ladysmith Black Mombazo, and Weeping.  Weeping is a strong political song, but not so pointed that it can only apply to one leader, country, etc.  I love hearing Josh expand his range and style with some pop sound.  Let's face it, that Voice can do no wrong, and I want to hear him singing all kinds of stuff.  It's all good, when Josh Groban sings it.....    Give the kid a break....of course he is going to experiment with all kinds of sounds and collaborate with all kinds of people.  More power to him. He started when he was 17...he has a very long career ahead of him.  Don't be surprised if it's heavy metal next year, LOL.  And, Josh, KEEP ON WRITING MUSIC AND LYRICS.    (My only complaint, which is common to all his albums, is that they are over-produced. His voice can stand up to it, but, please, cut the number of orchestra instruments in half.)
0743298020|4.0|This debut novel reminded me of a Charles Dickens book.  It is a well-told story that never disappoints its reader in either character development or a plot filled with suspense.  I truly couldn't put it down - it is a book to read by the fire long into the night.  I hated to see it end because I knew it wouldn't be there waiting for me to read.  This is not serious fiction like \\"Suite Francaise,\\" but it is truly mesmerizing.  Diane Setterfield has a true gift that I hope will result in another book very soon.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Al Gore has a very good message and it needs to be heard. He presents it in a powerful way. However, Al has one big problem his ego and an ax to grind. He never knows when to stop. To his credit, he does a decent job of toning down the politics, but he disparages replubicans exclusively. Excuse me, there was the Clinton/Gore whitehouse for 8 years between the Bush's, but nary a word about that presidency. The present administration deserves a lot of heat, but this is a bigger problem than what Bush created. I agree Man is exacerbating global warming, but the whole look at the life of Al Gore and the sacrifices he makes for this cause, slow the movie down immeasureably. I mean if he was likeable, he would have pounded G. W. in the election. <br /> <br />Another problem, he perpetuates every myth about global warming and does not give the whole story. I know Crichton has took Gore to task for some of the facts presented before this movie was even made. Gore quoted a paper that there is total agreement by almost all scientists on global warming. Crichton pointed out that this research on the research can not be duplicated. It would be extremely surprising that there would be total agreement. The diversity of opinion it what makes research work. Do not get me wrong, the movie does present evidence Man's contribution to global warming in a very convincing manner, but Gore does not present a balance view. Another example, the frog in the boiling water myth. Never happens. The frog jumps out when he gets hot. I am being picky, but it proves my point. This is message that needs to be preached, but don't expect impartiality from this movie or perfect research.   <br /> <br />In summary, this movie makes excellent points about the dangers we face and they need to be addressed. It does it in a entertaining and powerful  way. Gore is to be commended for his work. Unfortunately, the hero worship of Gore in this movie detracts from the message.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Yes, we all loved the book.  Yes, we would all like the movie to showcase every scene in the movie as it is portrayed in the book,.....but that is never the case when books are put to screenplay.  I enjoyed this version immensely, and with some downfalls aside, I think it was well done.  I thought there was very thoughtful consideration done with the characterization of Jane's and Rochester's strange relationship, and I enjoyed the humerous interplay they showcased in several scenes.  I, too, was slightly disappointed with the scene where Rochester proclaims his love for Jane,(I wanted the darkness in the garden, Jane trying to escape Rochester's attention as he kneels to look at flora) and was disappointed that it was shot mid-afternooon with the two of them simply taking a walk together.   <br />    Some will say that Toby Stephens is too young, too handsome for the character of Rochester.  I shrug my shoulders at this.  There is a part of me in love with the character of Rochester, and if they wish to protray him with an actor that isn't quite old enough or \\"ugly\\" enough, I don't care.  He did a fine job of portraying Rochester's rudeness and uptight mannerisms, and if he's a little easy on the eyes, all the better for us readers that tend to daydream a little.
B000K7UBTI|2.0|disappointed.  The animation is good, but the story and dialogue were weak. <br /> <br />The ending was what REALLY ruined it for me.  The entire Mandarin sub-plot was confusing, LONG and boring.  I actually couldn't wait for the movie to be over (so I could pop in my Pink Panter cartoon DVD)...but since I'm a 35 year fan of Iron Man, I rode out the storm.  The writers were trying to make some kind of french cuisine with the story, when all i really wanted was meat and potatoes (if you get my drift).  There was a shortage of dialogue in the last battle sequence. <br /> <br />What a shame for fans of the franchise.
B000001ELL|3.0|I think most people are afraid of any groups changing their sound.Groups want to change direction,fans don't.Although KISS is still classified as Heavy Metal{at least thats the filing in stores}can get away with a disco album.Imagine PANTERA going country? Or at least for one album? Scary thought isn't it.Never the less KISS will always be rejuvenating new fans and keeping their old.They actually had a symphony backing them up and it was excellent.I know I'm getting off the beaten path but for 79 this was a commercial hit in clubs and dancable.I still chuckle when I hear BETH.The song has no drumming.Its sung by Criss! Never a dull moment!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|The most original movie of 2006, possibly the best movie, too! A clever, interesting, vibrant, fast moving story combined with terrific character development and the perfect sense of humor made watching \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" an absolute joy! Each and every acting performance appeared flawless, reflecting highly on both the performers and their director. <br /> <br />I was riveted to my seat and disappointed only that I couldn't be with these characters for at least as long again. I doubt that anyone seeing this movie only once will ever realize all that they missed at their first viewing, as there is so much background material, both visual and aural, that is properly and cleverly subordinated to the story and characters. Overall, I found this every bit as fresh on the second viewing as was the first. <br /> <br />For example, well into the story, when Harold is trying to find how to reach the narrator/author, he returns to his workplace after his forced \\"vacation\\" and hurries through the building. Watching him scurry about, a co-worker can barely be overheard saying in a fairly distinct cadence \\"where ever he went I do not want to go\\" - a comment on Harold's known to be dull life and lifestyle, as well as on his current state of frenzy which is void of the relaxed attitude that one expects to see after a vacation. <br /> <br />There were many complex visual angles to this movie, as well. Such as earlier on in the movie, with the juxtaposition of the quite tall Harold sitting somewhat slouched opposite the diminutive psychiatrist played confidently by Linda Hunt. There is a similar situation when the literature prof. played by Dustin Hoffman attempts to close his office door on Harold - unsuccessfully - without getting him to budge, much less leave. There are many more stimuli that exist to both startle, amaze, and challenge the audience throughout the film. <br /> <br />I found this movie to be as original and incomparable as they come - the equivalent of a \\"Being John Malkovich\\" and the other jewels that we search for each year but seldom find. As for humor, I found myself laughing as much as during any classic episode of Saturday Night Live. Unhesitatingly, a five star show worthy of repeated viewing.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|This Saw 3 is good but I could tell it was rushed.Why!When you are sitting on a gold mine why louse it up?!This time Jigsaw needs to have a tumor removed from his head and Amanda kidnaps a doctor to perform surgery on him.Meanwhile somewhere in the building a man bent on revenge is trying to find the man responsible for the death of his son by auto.There's a body frozen hanging from the ceiling.A man body being twisted like a pretzle and yes shooting.The second one was creative and the first was original and unique.This one is good but I can only hope this is the last one.The ending tells me so,but there's always room to sink lower.
B000002KLZ|5.0|I love this album.  I know it received lukewarm reviews upon its initial release in '80 (including a measly two and a half stars from Rolling Stone - if memory serves me).  I know it isn't quite as polished as The Dance and was no where near as successful sales wise.  But I could listen to this double live set over and over and never get tired of it.  (And in fact that's exactly what I've been doing this winter.  It makes a great companion on a cold night's drive home from work.)  Maybe it is my thirty years love affair with the band.  Or maybe, more likely, it is the brilliance of their singing and songwriting.  There is no other group quite like them.  They are unmistakable and inimitable. <br /> <br />In addition to playing familiar hits live, the band offers new songs as well.  Once again Christine McVie scores a vocal bull's eye with \\"One More Lonely Night.\\"  Seemingly, deceptively without effort, she manages to convey anguish, loneliness, desire, and wisdom.  \\"Farmer's Daughter\\" is just a lovely bit of jauntiness.  And I was floored by L. Buckingham's version of \\"Oh Well.\\"  Yes, he does go a bit overboard with the extracurricular wails and cries, as though he forgot the song he was supposed to sing and lapses into John Lennon's \\"Well Well Well\\" instead, but overall it's a stunning, moving performance. <br /> <br />As for the classic songs, whether they're performed in a studio or on a stage, they never fail to enthrall.  They move you, make you dance, have you singing right along with them.  If not, you're not really a Mac fan. <br /> <br />This is an underappreciated classic.  I predict it will gain prestige in the years to come.
0515142247|4.0|And it certainly doesn't try to be. What this novel is, like the one before it is a rip roaring good thriller that keeps you entertained right to the final pages. Drifter Jack Reacher is outside a dry cleaning shop helping an attractive young women with her clothes when three men approach with guns and suddenly he and the women are kidnapped. The book is great fun, except one sequence that ratcheted up my fear of tight spaces to a new level. If your looking for thilling escapist reading you've come to the right place.
B00001QEE8|5.0|Though it diverges wildly  from the the original story by Rudyard Kipling  Disney's THE JUNGLE BOOK is one of the mouse's best classic animated musical movies.  The voice actors are excellent and the songs are clever, memorable and move the story forward.  There is enough action and humor for adults to enjoy the movie and though there are villains they are not too scary for the little ones.  All ends happily though bittersweetly.
B000GT7XXW|4.0|I gave four stars for the film alone and minus one star because of all the problems I have been having with the download. The file itself is somewhat choppy and I can only play it in my Windows Media Player, any other way and my computer freezes. If you are a lover of Hamlet and are too anxious to wait for the DVD (since we have been waiting forever now) than I would go ahead and purchase it. But be ready for a long download, I went to bed and it finished right when I was getting up and I have DSL!
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|This adaptation of JANE EYRE is adequate and certainly  romantic enough to cause  teenagers and romance novel devotees to swoon  and it may be to appeal to those very viewers that some unnecessary changes were made from the book.  I did like Ruth Wilson's portrayal of Jane since she looks young, intelligent and attractive but not conventionally pretty though contrary to the book she is not \\"little\\" but as tall as her rather short miniseries love interest. This version's  Rochester is very handsome, charming and more likable then the melancholy, moody physically ugly man Jane falls in love with in the novel. In fact the most glaring change from the book  is  Rochester seems too socially popular and well adjusted to fall passionately in love with this young girl and risk society's disapproval to have her.  He also seems way too normal to keep his nutty wife locked in the attic while entertaining guests and courting a prospective bride on the lower floors but then again that rather implausible plot line  is true to Bronte's text. <br />   <br />Much of Bronte's beautiful language in speeches between Jane and Rochester has been \\"dumbed\\" down (or modernized) though the original language for the most part is not inaccessible to the average Masterpiece Theatre viewer.  And Jane's religious convictions and the mores of the 19th century are not explored at all.  It seems inexplicable to this modern viewer that our rather plain, poor, previously unloved Jane would leave this rich, charming, hunk and a life of being adored to wander impoverished and friendless around on the moors.  The Rochester of Bronte's novel was a little scary and even dangerous and there was always more than a hint that if Jane stayed with him she might end up abandoned and disgraced making her choice in leaving him much more understandable.   <br /> <br />Though somewhat rushed I do like the scenes of Jane's childhood and her time with the Rivers family and the proposal from St. John is also given faircoverage.  I did not like all the twin imagery or Rochester's passion for nature which were pure invention for this version.  And small point that it is I don't understand why the filmmakers had to have a blond Blanche Ingram when there are many beautiful black haired actresses who would have fit the novel's description much better. <br /> <br />Still any Jane Eyre is better than no Jane Eyre and despite its flaws this is an enjoyable and entertaining production.
B000FDFVZ6|1.0|This book was incredibly boring. Susie dies and looks down upon her incredibly boring life. Yawn. I could not care less about any of the characters. I absolutely could not believe my eyes reading all the praises stamped all over the book. Were they reading the same book as I was?
B000BAQ8A0|4.0|This is a Madrid performance of Rossini's much performed opera.<br /><br />I have been given to understand that this is the complete version.  Credit goes to the stage production and to those singers who gave the 'completeness' to the production, especially Florez.<br /><br />It could have been a perfect production if the Figaro and Rosina were not casted to singers who are much too mature for the role, compared with Juan's Count Almaviva.<br /><br />Spagnoli's Figaro lacked the mischievous light-heartedness required of the role, while Bayo is a strain both on the ears and the eyes with her dry and gritty tone and slightly over-aged appearance.<br /><br />Much more fun to watch the old DVD with Erika Koeth as Rosina, Hermann Prey as Figaro.  Their duet at Act II were so funny and entertaining, as compared to what was presented here.<br /><br />This production is otherwise recommended, especially for those beginning to watch operas.
0156027321|5.0|Written from the point of view of a 16 year old who spends 270 days at sea in an open boat with a Bengal tiger, this far-fetched adventure tests the limits of human endurance.<br /><br />Given the above facts, I suspect the first reaction of most of us would be stark terror. Yet the author cleverly divides his book into two parts. In the first part, the reader becomes familiar with  `Pi, his distinct philosophy, capabilities and resources, not the least of which is a unique `take' on the world and all its foibles. His philosophical musings do run up and down the keyboard of life, at times seeming to be witty little asides and diversions, but in the end they serve their purpose well as they set the reader up for the  clever dissociations with which Pi filters reality.<br /><br /> When the catastrophe on the high seas occurs Yant minces no words. Book II opens succinctly.<br /><br /> The Pacific Ocean: The ship sank.<br /><br /> So how did it happen Pi found himself in an open boat with a tiger? He came from a zoo-keeping family in India. When his parents sold the zoo and its animals, they accompany the beasts from India to their new homes in North America.<br /><br /> What a philosopher Pi is. Is he the only devout practicing Hindu-Christian-Buddhist-Moslem-Jew in the world? Versed in the art of training animals, his adventures convince him to take a double major at University in zoology and religion, which is the point where the story opens and our first hint that something somewhat bizarre is about to take place.<br /><br /> If you face challenges (and don't we all), get ready to make light of all your struggles, as you open this book. Surely few have endured the great pains that Pi has. If there be any fault with the story, it is at times a bit too incredulous, but then again the author makes it very clear the reader his entered `the story zone,' where all may not be quite as it seems. The story too, may at times wax a bit saccharine. Nevertheless, Yant's imagination and verve as characterized in the boy/man narrator Pi is inspiring. For though Pi loses his entire family and endures horrendous suffering at sea, his buoyant resiliency carries the day.d in the boy/man narrator Pi is inspiring.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|This was one of my favorite concerts of the past several years. Madonna is at the peak of her game here. Her band on this tour is very tight, and the visuals are stunning. The dancers are fantastic as well. I particularly liked the way she \\"updated\\" some of her older tunes to give them more of a \\"Confessions\\" feel. I saw this show three times in person, and watching this DVD makes me feel like I'm there again. Jonas Ackerland did a great job putting this film together; but hey, he had some great material to work with. Jamie King's stage production on this tour captures the essence of M unlike any other tour she has done to date. An amazing DVD for Madonna fans, and even if you're not a fan...you'd still love it. I'm mean c'mon, it's Madonna!
B000F8O2OM|4.0|The Stargate team soldiers through another season of interstellar adventures.  Interesting developments include the introduction of the Tok'ra, the discovery of the Asgard, and a return to the planet Abydos from the original Stargate movie.  Clever writing and the continuing development of the Stargate universe with its diverse races and power struggles balance out the weaker episodes.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|For those of us who couldn't get to see Madonna in her sell-out \\"Confessions Tour\\" we're given that chance at the Arena at Wembley! Madonna in her late 40's still is the material girl and gives her London fans what they want, nothing but non-stop, great music! The DVD of the show is an AMAZING feast for the ears and the eyes! The CD is a highlights album of the show, but NO problem.. the full concert will be released soon, but the disc is fine... for now anyway! The hit concert, based on the HIT album.. NOT to be missed!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Those who may truly regard themselves as fans of James Bond enjoy both Ian Fleming's novels as well as the movies, but they also understand that, unfortunately, the two are in completely separate worlds.  Occasionally through the years, the producers (be they Albert R. Brocolli and Harry Saltzman, or Barbara Brocolli and Michael Wilson) have \\"screwed up\\" and managed to somewhat successfully merge the two worlds, and my opinion is that these have proven to be the best movies of them all.  \\"From Russia with Love\\" and \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" follow Fleming's works very faithfully, and are great (though the pity is hardly anyone has heard of \\"OHMSS\\").  \\"Casino Royale\\" manages the same, with the understood updating and fleshing out of a 53 year-old, 180-something page novel.  Gone are the miserable one-liners, the seemingly obligatory and ridiculous banter with Q, the comically unbelievable gadgets, and SOME of the obvious bill-paying by flashing the latest model BMW or Astin Martin.  What is left is a smooth but hard-hitting action film that is in my opinion the best of the Bonds because it leaves intact Fleming's story as well as his stone-cold, no-nonsense character.  If you believe that it simply cannot be a \\"Bond Movie\\" because it lacks those items above (and for other silly reasons, like the opening being different, and Daniel Craig's hair color), that is fine; you just fail to understand the difference between a \\"Bond Movie\\" and a genuine Bond movie.
B0002DB52M|2.0|Almost turned this movie off...it was so weird.  But turned it back on because I was having a boring day and didn't have anything else to watch.<br /><br />I don't like Nicole Kidman...I find her bland.  And the story and set was dark and dreary.  I knew the director/writer was trying to make some kind of a statement and hung on wondering when it would come clear.<br /><br />So when the gangster father turns up in the last scenes (the father of Grace) I started wondering...is this a religious allegory?  Could it be that the writer is trying to tell us that no matter how much grace is poured out, the \\"dog\\" will win out (the sinful nature of man) and her experience in \\"Dogville\\" has finally convinced her that her father is right.  The town (symbolizing the world) deserves judgment.<br /><br />Thus, the only thing left alive and standing in the town is the dog (significantly named the Biblical \\"Moses\\")...ergo sin.<br /><br />If this is the message, the film has at least a bit of an interesting message.  Thus, I have it 2 stars instead of 1.<br /><br />If this isn't the message, it is a load of slop and deserves only 1 star.
B000089QEN|5.0|This is brisk, fun production that doesn't take itself any more seriously than it should, and doesn't mind winking at us with a secret smile at the same time.  The story of Becky Sharp, a girl who is never any better than she needs to be, and her friend Amelia who is much too good for her own good.<br /><br />Natasha Little is simply perfect as Becky.  Little is the kind of woman that women find hard to like: delicately beautiful, exceptionally talented - making her perfect to play Becky.  It is the subtle nuances in her moments that give her performance great depth and complexity - needed for accessibility for a selfish character who is the smartest person in any room she is in.  Becky is a woman who would agree with the quote of another brilliant beauty, Hedy Lamar: \\"Any woman can be glamourous.  All she has to do is stand still and look stupid.\\" Little's Beky  is not as likable or vulnerable as Reese Witherspoon - who played Becky in a major motion picture film version made right around the same time - but with a miniseries we have time to understand her more.  Besides, not many actresses are as likable as Witherspoon.<br /><br />As the story begins, this production does not look lavish, but the casting is so wonderful, the script so strong, the costumes simple but just right, that we are given the ability to focus on getting to know the people we will be following through 6 episodes.<br /><br />It is this initial simplicity that is the brilliance of the production design by Malcolm Thornton.  In the early stages, poverty is cramped and messy; work is dark, cluttered and rotting, and wealth is clean, and bright and airy... like freedom.  As we progress throught the story, wealth becomes more complex, overstuffed and overdecorated, echoing the complexity of the lives of Becky and Rawdon.  Rawdon played by the handsome and overwhelmingly talented Nathaniel Parker (INSPECTOR LINLEY, BLEAK HOUSE).<br /><br />Breathtaking Andrew Davies, possibly the most brilliant adapter of the classics of all time, gifts us with a screenplay of grace and subtlety, weaving the ease of modern speech perfectly into the period action in a way that feels classic, but is totally accessible.<br /><br />It all bounces along to the ohm-pa-pa of a brass band.  This band is one of the anachronistic touches of the production.  While it passes as a military band, it also has a the raw, slightly under-rehearsed sound of a New Orleans jazz band, and sometimes a 1940s dancehall... meanwhile Becky's musical choices are straight from the pub... to the delight of the men around her.  The band is really the only downfall of the production, in the moments of great serious importance, the band hits us over the head with a blaringly repetitive theme that gets very annoying after 6 episodes.  It is the only \\"wrong note\\" in an otherwise witty and wise score.  One of the nice subtle touches is that even Becky's singing, which at first seems flawless and delightful, begins to sound a bit flat in the episodes where we see dark results of her behavior on those around her.<br /><br />The music for Amelia and William is completely different.  Plaintive melodies played as quietly as loyalty and love that things only of the good of the beloved.  Philip Glenister as William carries the heart of the piece with affecting restraint.  Miriam Margoles does her best work EVER here, and Jeremy Swift as Jos is absolutely delightful in every moment he is on screen!<br /><br />This entire miniseries is just marvelous, aspects of the production in tune with each other, in service to the whole piece.  FANTASTIC.pter of the classics of all time, gifts us with a screenplay of grace and subtlety, weaving the ease of modern speech perfectly into the period action in a way that feels classic, but is totally accessible.<br /><br />It all bounces along to the ohm-pa-pa of a brass band.
