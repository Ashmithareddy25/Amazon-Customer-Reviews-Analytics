B0002JJBZY|5.0|I grew up watching the Original series on TV, so to finally have the full series on DVD is great. The quality of the DVD set is very good, both in physical and video terms. The cases are well made and packaged. You do need to bear in mind that these are not going to have the same high definition video or sound quality that current productions have, however that aside, they are surprisingly clean. We have been enjoying taking a trip back in time and have watched the series in order from the beginning, viewing an episode or two every few nights. If you're a fan, you will not be disappointed in this set.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|This app was terrific until it started changing some, but not all of my appointment times. The Times are still correct on my Google calendar, but business calendar is changing appointment times by one hour on some events, but not all events, so I can't trust any event times in business calendar.<br />My wife's business calendar is having the same problem. If issue was fixed,I would happily rate it a 5.

The language is practical and modern.It makes a wonderful companion to formal teacher training - it feels as if a mentor is near. This is an essential supportive book for the modern yogi.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|The original American Idol brings the goods on her fifth album, her most consistent collection to date IMHO. It includes several self-empowerment anthems, the best of which is the disco thumper title track (a.k.a. \\"What Doesn't Kill You\\"). In the midst of my own marital/relationship strife this song arrived at the perfect time; the `doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone' line being especially significant for me. Perhaps this song could replace the now tired disco standard \\"I Will Survive\\" in karaoke bars and at gay rallies- a great 21st century update! Other songs on \\"Stronger\\" in this vein include \\"I Forgive You\\"; \\"The War is Over\\", about a war of hearts; first single \\"Mr. Know It All\\" and one of the bonus tracks, the rocking \\"Don't Be A Girl About It\\", one of seven songs Kelly co-wrote.<br /><br />Kelly doesn't hide from self doubt either. \\"Dark Side\\", with its alternating ballad/rocker dynamic is probably the best of these types of songs, with our girl pleading `don't run away, promise you'll stay'. The two songs that immediately follow don't shy away from that kind of emotional turmoil, bringing the heartbreak home. When Kelly sings `You said you love me but I'm not good enough' it's crying time. The uptempo \\"Einstein\\" shows another side of Ms. Clarkson- angry and defiant (not to mention a little humorous) and it kicks ass with its `dumb plus dumb equals you' refrain. After the first six emotionally intense tracks, Kelly takes a bit of a breather with the delicate, lovely \\"Standing In Front of You\\". \\"Hello\\" is a rousing uptempo number with just a hint of doubt as is \\"You Can't Win\\", a heartfelt song about being a misfit and dealing with the tabloids.<br /><br />If you can afford it, spring for the deluxe version which includes her powerful duet with Jason Aldean \\"Don't You Wanna Stay\\"; \\"Alone\\", a song in the Kelly-is-pissed off mode and the uplifting final track \\"The Sun Will Rise\\".<br /><br />Kudos to Kelly for helping to get me (and hopefully many others) through a tough time. And though this obviously isn't a political forum, I do think it's very cool of Kelly to be backing Ron Paul!ough a tough time. And though this obviously isn't a political forum, I do think it's very cool of Kelly to be backing Ron Paul!
B00319ECGK|3.0|I bought this BluRay as a present for Xmas - and wound up returning it for a new copy because it wouldn't play in any of my parents' BluRay players. The second copy could BARELY work in my PS3 (it had a super long loading time) and when I tried to use it in my parents' player, I had to reinsert it a billion times until it actually worked.<br /><br />Then it had several moments of skipping once it actually started playing.<br /><br />The quality of the picture is great, I just don't understand why both copies had a hard time playing.

B005P3NPXG|4.0|In the four years since Seal released his first \\"Soul\\" CD, it has quietly racked up over a half-million sales. That's a pretty good number in this day and age, and probably more that \\"6 Commitment\\" has sold since being released two years ago. Like Michale McDonald discovered via his two \\"Motown\\" albums, there's nothing like expertly executed nostalgia to resurrect a stalled career. While Seal is hardly faded into obscurity, it was inevitable that Seal would ultimately come back for another dip into this well.<br /><br />Much like the 2008 \\"Soul,\\" Seal's beautiful voice slides like silk across these 11 songs, and again, he has the smooth production of David Foster (with an assist from Trevor Horn) to assure that there are no flaws in the system. So when Seal wraps those pipes of his around Teddy Pendergrass's \\"Love TKO\\" or leans into The O'Jays' \\"Backstabbers,\\" you can feel the professional commitment all parties bring to the recording. I also like the way they kept the Philly Groove that so enhances The Spinners' \\"I'll Be Around.\\"<br /><br />What leaves me a little cold towards \\"Soul 2\\" are the same things I felt the first \\"Soul\\" could have been better. The song selection is comprised of songs you'd likely hear two or three times a day on your local All Golden Oldies radio station. Seal pulls no surprises out of the bag (ala Ann Peeble's \\"I Can't Stand The Rain\\" and Denice Williams' \\"Free\\" from the first version), and he could have easily dug deeper than the done to death \\"What's Goin' On\\" or \\"Let's Stay Together.\\" (I mean, really. Even President Obama has covered that one.) Even with the safest material here, Seal's \\"Soul 2\\" makes for a pleasant interlude. Be prepared for \\"Soul 3\\" likely appearing around 2016.
B006OV7RQ4|5.0|I remember back when this little indie was coming out of Sundance with all that buzz and promise and everyone (including myself) was convinced that Elizabeth Olsen was going to ride her buzz all the way to an Oscar nomination.  Then, for some weird reason, it just disappeared.  Olsen picked up a few sporadic mentions (the NBR breakthrough win and a BFCA nomination) but ultimately, Rooney Mara nabbed the `hot young thing' attention from Olsen and took the Oscar nomination from her.  It was perplexing to me, considering all the attention she received coming out of Sundance and the film's thematic elements.  Still, I had yet to see the film and so my opinion was solely based on word of mouth and presumed expectations.<br /><br />I'm speechless at her Oscar miss, now that I've actually seen the film.<br /><br />`Martha Marcy May Marlene', expertly conceived, flawlessly edited and beautifully acted, tells the story of a young woman named Martha who gets inducted into a cult, dons the name Marcy May and disappears for two years only to resurface into the lives of her sister and her sister's new husband.  She is close-mouthed about her time spent in the cult and her memories haunt her movements as she fears they will soon come after her.  Martha tries to find her place back in the real world, but her mind and her thought process has been so corroded that she blurs the lines between real life and the life she was taught to the point where everything becomes a strain.<br /><br />Hands down, Elizabeth Olsen delivers one so the best performances of the year.  She is outstanding here.  Her naturalness in front of the camera is expertly played against the apparent awkwardness of her situation.  The way her eyes betray her own insecurities and the way she imbues honesty into her most complicated scenes.  She's just brilliant here.<br /><br />The atmosphere created in this film really takes it that extra mile.  It is a thriller of sorts, playing heavily on the fearful tones accompanied by the idea of a cult survivor, but it balances those tones beautifully behind the mask of redemptive situations.  This is the story of a lost young woman trying to be found.  The thing is, she was lost long before she joined the cult and so there really is nowhere to be found since leaving the cult wasn't the ultimate solution.  Sean Durkin's beautifully crafts this character study with so much care and delicacy.  It moves, purposefully, at a slower pace so as to soak in that feeling of unsteadiness.  Watching Martha's life interweave with the life of Marcy May is organic and completely overtaking.<br /><br />I'm baffled that half these reviews are negative.anied by the idea of a cult survivor, but it balances those tones beautifully behind the mask of redemptive situations.

0743289692|5.0|This is a book about survival against all odds. On nearly every page of the book a story is told that makes you wonder, \\"How is this woman still alive?\\" The book is the incredible autobiography of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somalian woman who escaped her family, clan, culture, and religion in search of freedom.<br /><br />Let me say at the top that I highly recommend this book for several reasons. First, it provides a view of clan culture in East Africa that for me at least was new, informative, and enlightening. Second, it helps you understand the ways in which Islam works itself out in different cultures, the political ideology the religion demands, and the manner in which the theological system and traditions that have built up over centuries regard people, girls and women in particular, and life itself.<br /><br />Third, the book is simply compelling. It's different, relates familial or religious practices that are astounding for their disparagement of human life and individual value, and provides a social analysis at once winsome and courageous. Fourth, the author Ali was always smart but is by now a well-educated woman who can write. I'd even say gifted as a writer. I was hooked in the first few pages. Fifth, Ali is a political scientist by education and profession so her political and cultural analysis is as good as any you'll find dealing with the topics she addresses.<br /><br />Ali made her escape from Germany by taking a train to Holland where she found a kind people and a welfare state especially prepared to receive and nurture a scared but strong Somali woman who wanted nothing but to be independent, to live freely. She made this bold run for freedom at 22 years of age after her father had arranged a marriage for her with a Somali man living in Canada, a man she did not choose. Her father had put her on a jet to Canada but she bailed during her layover in Germany.<br /><br />The book relates with amazing memory formative events from her childhood spent in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, and Kenya. She describes her religious odyssey, one that eventually saw her reject Islam and embrace atheism. (Ali at least in this book is not an \\"angry atheist\\" and she does not attack Christianity. She simply no longer believes in God or an afterlife.) She speaks knowledgeably and movingly about female genital mutilation--which she endured, the sexual paranoia of her religion and culture, and her later experiences with love and sexual maturity. And she shares her feelings and concerns for family members who, though often hateful and abusive, she still loves.<br /><br />Eventually, through what can only be described as a process of pluck and passion she becomes an elected Member of Parliament in the Netherlands, makes a controversial short film with a Dutch producer about the plight of women under Islam, loses her Dutch citizenship only to have it restored, and finally immigrates to America.<br /><br />In the meantime, the Dutch producer is brutally killed on a Holland sidewalk by an Islamist murderer who leaves a note pinioned to the dead man's chest with a knife, a note to Ali. She then becomes the focus of Islamist assassins and now requires constant security likely for the remainder of her life. As a result of all this she becomes a personality lauded worldwide for her beliefs and actions in support of freeing women and girls from religious suppression.<br /><br />Ali is especially articulate and passionate about multiculturalism, which she believes allows cultures to perpetuate evil in the name of moral relativism. She believes most European countries have made a huge mistake in adopting a multiculturalist attitude toward immigrants, which she contends delays their assimilation and adoption of the new language and new values in their new homeland. This, she says, perpetuates poverty, isolation, ignorance, and suppression of creativity and independence in women, thus denying the economy productivity it and the immigrant group could enjoy.<br/><br />As I said, I highly recommend this book because it is well written and because I believe Ali offers so many sagacious lessons. The West would do well to listen and to learn./><br />As I said, I highly recommend this book because it is well written and because I believe Ali offers so many sagacious lessons.

B005CKPPNA|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite series.  This is up there along the lines of the series The Wire.  Well maybe not quite, nothing could beat The Wire but this one is damn good.<br /><br />You must watch the series from the very beginning to understand it.  It starts with a high school chemistry teacher who gets cancer, gets laid off from work, and needs a way to ensure his family is taken care of when he passes away.  He hooks up with a \\"bad seed\\" sort of student and they go into the meth business together.  Being a chemistry teacher affords the main character the opportunity to make the best meth out.  This creates enemies from other drug organizations, business opportunities, and heat from the feds.  It's been on of the most interesting series I've seen in a while.<br /><br />To give you a taste<br />of the type of shows I watch:<br /><br />The Wire (series)<br />The Killing (series)<br />6 Feet Under (series)<br />Bill Maher<br />Forensic Files<br />Dateline on ID<br />I survived
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very good dystopian novel about a subject similar to that of 1984, written many, many decades ago.  The idea of an all-controlling, malicious force such as Big Brother is not new.  It's a recurrent fear of all freedom-loving humans.  The breakup of the former Soviet Union gives voice to man's loathing of being controlled and enslaved.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is scary, but unsentimental, providing us a wonderful heroine in Katniss, who is down to earth and uttlery non-narcissistic (a flaw found in literature too often these days).<br /><br />I only discovered that this is a YA book.  As a proud grandmother, I read it without this knowledge, and will recommend it for reading when my grandchildren come of age.<br /><br />Plan to read the trilogy.

B006C67NP6|4.0|Around town early adopters of iRealb on the iPad loved it and started bringing them to jams and shows. Then the 200 dollar Fire came out, and there is unanimous agreement that it is superior in nearly all regards for the iRealb application.  The largest being the size reduction. The Kindle size is perfect for a music stand or a small table corner. It takes up way less space, is much easier to carry and brings the same feature set (if there are critical differences between iOS IRB and Android IRB, I have not faced them) as other platforms. Any smaller and it would be too small for reading music charts.<br /><br />The user interface is not overly intuitive and takes some time to understand.  But once you've authored a handful of charts, it becomes nicely manageable.  The ability to share files is limited to posting and downloading from the forum or sending email links.  This works and it's how we share tunes between our group. But it's also cumbersome, poorly conceived and a bit odd in this age of cloud computing and service-based data applications.  I think a plug-in architecture addition would be wonderful. Then I could code a DropBox component that automatically syncs tunes/changes/playlists for all members of my group.<br /><br />I also think this app should be open source (again, so I could contribute features to it), but I won't blame the fellow for wanting to make a living.<br /><br />The systemic shortcomings aside, there's just too much value to be had to not give this application a strong rating.  I've gained a great deal from it.

B0069UP2PI|4.0|Tale of a deadly virus transmitted by fomites that proceeds to wipe out a good part of the world resulting in a global panic. Interestingly enough there is no single main character in this tale. Instead, we jump all over the globe tracking main characters in their particular venues and then jumping to another. Ensemble cast includes Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Elliott Gould and Kate Winslet. It gets fairly horrific at the end when you see all the dead bodies and hear how many have died. There's some good coverage here on broken down social orders turning to panic, public health and science reactions to the virus and individual selfishness/self sacrifice as the virus hits. Some scientific types praised how the scientists in the film began to study and attempt to attack the virus maintaining it was at least accurate compared to other films. At the very end you get to see how the mysterious virus all began. Note that the Spanish Flu of the early 20th century is said to have infected/wiped out 27% of the world and is mentioned in this film by comparison. Note that the film seems to put much more emphasis on certain focuses than a well composed tale. The budget for this film was $65M and it made over $135M at the Box Office. STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; FOCUSES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of February 2012.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a great game. I can never seem to put it down. The boyfriend and I always try to beat each others score.
0439023521|3.0|Other reviews will cover the story, so this is just to focus on the content.  Frankly it's surprising that this is being pitched as a 'kids' book.  While well written and leaving the groundwork for a larger backstory, a large, large amount of this first book is focused on graphic violence that would be more at home in a war movie.  Many scenes almost seem to revel in the graphic nature of the killing.<br /><br />Particularly disturbing is the portrayal of the casual ease in which kids become enthusiastic killers.  Fans might argue that the desperate situation in the story and the constraints of the state force it, but no, that doesn't explain the empty, detached sense or complete lack of real compassion.<br /><br />In a world where kid on kid violence is a reality in the daily news, do you really want to portray these behaviors as 'ok?'  Strongly suggest you read this book yourself before getting it for any teen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All 3 of the books in this trilogy far exceeded my expectations. It had kind of a  dark \\"Wizard of Oz Feel \\", in a post apoclyptic world, but the back stories were interesting enough to make you forget that it was essentailly fighting to the death for the right to survive, only to be sent back to the area again.

But after sitting on the shelf for a few months we picked it up last week to watch it and it wouldn't load.

1442419814|3.0|Interesting premise, but the focus was definitely on way over-describing action scenes and not on the plot.  Travels of a main character alone took way too long to get through as it was mainly different words all saying the same thing about hoverboarding.<br /><br />Also, very heavy handed messages about how the world is being ruined by us \\"rusties\\" currently living here. A lighter approach could have conveyed the same thing without being as preachy.
B006UG90RM|4.0|The first major concert I ever went to was Van Halen on their Hide Your Sheep/Diver Down tour in the fall of 1983. It was at the Syracuse, NY Carrier Dome. Me and some buds took my father's station wagon to the show - complete with rear facing third seat. I ran into a friend outside the venue before the show who had gone off to college and I hadn't seen in a while, and we shared some Jack Daniels among other things. The band celebrated David Lee Roth's birthday that night (it was actually the next day though.) The sound sucked, but I'll never forget it. What a show!<br /><br />Flash forward to 2012. It's been a while since I bought any Van Halen albums. I have all the Roth ones, but no Van Hagars. It isn't that I don't like Sammy, just didn't get it after Dave left. Maybe it started with 1984, but more on that later. I had read some pretty good reviews and heard \\"Tattoo\\" once on the radio. It sounded ok, so I thought I would give it a whirl. I picked one up at the Target and put the disc in my CD player for the first time on the way home from work. Once I began listening to A Different Kind of Truth, my expectations were so far exceeded it was mind blowing. There were a couple of times I actually got chills from the experience. A huge smile didn't leave my face until well after the fade out at the end of \\"Beats Workin'\\".<br /><br />Listening to this CD brought back memories of being in high school, riding around in my friend's red 1965 Mustang convertible playing Ice Cream Man as loud as it would go, over and over and over. Now THIS is Van Halen!!! I do miss the fact that Michael Anthony is not on bass, but only on paper. Wolfie holds his own and fits right in - no offense Mike. Alex and Eddie are on fire, and Dave is, well, Dave. This album is great and it Rocks! All killer, No filler!! I don't recall hearing a single keyboard either. Not that there's anything wrong with it; I just prefer my Van Halen without. The gang sounds great and the tempo is turned up on every track. They have absolutely got that old magic back. For a few extra bucks, I definitely recommend getting the deluxe version with bonus DVD of \\"The Downtown Sessions.\\" It's a very entertaining companion to the long player. I own well over 2000 compact discs, many of which I purchased on Amazon.com (not this one.) Anywho, I enjoyed the new VH so much that I had to write my first review. So why 4 stars and not 5? It's entertainment, and damn good at that, but it's not a Michelangelo. STAY FROSTY...
B004L49K20|5.0|If you loved Duran in the 80s, you'll love their new album,too.  Well, it has been out for two years but I just discovered it.  The guys still look hot and \\"Girl Panic\\" is awesome.  Go to Youtube to check out the video.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Initially, this is a great game. Definitely the best Ive played so far. Unfortunately, whoever runs this game keeps coming out with useless updates, that take up around 300 MB every update. This is a problem on a kindle fire, due to its 8 GB memory... I can only have five or six other games installed right now because of this. Its a bummer, but definitely a five star game. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes mmorpg games, but kindle users be warned.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is the perfect app for my kindle except that you need wifi. it always works it is totally awesome, still not as good as the axial Bible but great.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|My kindle says I am 52% through this book so you would think by now it would have sucked me in.  People say they can't put it down but I find myself reading 1 chapter and then not picking it up again for a few days (I've even considered not finishing it).  This is what annoys me about this book:<br />1.) THE WRITING- I am not a writer but I feel like I could have written this book.  She reuses certain phrases so much that is has become annoying.  Such as: INNER GODDESS, OH MY, COCKS HIS HEAD, PURSES HIS LIPS.  First of all, what does inner goddess even mean??  I think I read this phrase 3 times on one page not counting the other 87 times it's used.  Stephanie Meyer used \\"Pursed lips\\" way too much in the twilight books so I never want to hear it again.  I've never read a book before where certain phrases were used so much that I can tell you them all right off the top of my head.  Maybe a thesaurus would have been helpful??<br />2.) THE CHARACTERS- I cannot relate to any character in the book.  All we hear about is how beautiful this billionaire guy is and I'm supposed to believe this plain Jane is playing hard to get??  Please!  A 21 year old would be ALL OVER THAT.  I don't believe for a second that this guy would put this much time into Ana. If a billionaire gives you a gift, don't bitch about it for 3 chapters, just accept it.  DUH!<br />3.)THE STORY-  I'm not some prude who finds this story disturbing.  I was excited to read a book like this.  The parts of the story that don't contain sex are simply boring and pointless and I find myself wanting to skip right to the sex scenes.  However, once the sex scenes come, they are just as boring.  Not descriptive enough and I haven't read the word \\"vagina\\" at all since it's usually referred to as \\"down there.\\"  Yea, that's sexy.  And good for her for being able to have so many orgasms from penetration (with her 1st sex partner), but that's not such an easy task for most women so I find that unbelievable as well.<br /><br/>Overall I am just at a loss.  I don't see how or why I would even want to read the next one.  Maybe the second half of the book will get better but I don't see how it's possible when I don't think she is a very talented writer.  I love the idea of it, just missed the mark for me.

B006NXIO7O|4.0|This movie is really good!  It showcases actress Zoe Saldana's great acting ability.  Not all actresses can carry action and be sensitive and be believable.
B001GY0FHM|2.0|People often describe a moment in a TV show or a movie where they gave up watching it, as a \\"jump the shark moment\\". This reference is taken from Fonzy's famous jump over the rubber shark. If I'm the only person in history who thought this movie jumped the shark, than so be it, but I believe it did. Jumped and landed right in the Abyss.<br /><br />For a crew that seems to be so knowledgeable on \\"Deep Pressure Syndrome\\" not to realize that the leader of the Seal team is not only suffering from it, but is on the verge of a nervous break down that will put them all in jeopardy, is just unforgivable. And to watch his team follow his every order so blindly knowing that his mentally capacity is completely gone makes them look ridiculous.<br /><br />Shark jumped...
0312370849|5.0|I loved this book...it was haunting...heartbreaking...but SO good. I didn't know about the Vel D'Hiv roundup before reading this book, so it was interesting to learn more about that. Highly recommend this book.

B00003CXA2|5.0|I ASKED A CO-WORKER WHY HE HAD NOT SEEN FORREST GUMP. AND HE SAID \\"IT'S NOT MY CUP OF TEA.\\" IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TEA, BUT EVERYTHING TO DO WITH LIFE. SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. THE MUSIC FITS IN PERFECTLY. THE HISTORY IS AMAZING. FORREST MAY BE SLOW, BUT HE REALLY THINKS THINGS THROUGH. I LOVED IT LONG AGO AND I LOVED IT JUST LAST WEEK.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I wouldn't say this is the best Christmas album, but it's still pretty good. Buble brings that classic sound that we all like so much.<br /><br />All the songs are classic and fun, and I think any fan of Buble would love this album, however his rendition of Santa Baby is odd and creepy for me.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I got my MicroShell Folio Cover in Pink yesterday and I should of bought this first. It looks great and is very easy to put on and feels really protected. My 5yr old daughter sometimes plays with my Kindle and I feel better knowing it is safer if she would drop it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This was a great book. It was well written and really held your interest but the first few chapters were a little hard to understand which made it hard to continue but if you do it was well worth it.
B00013AXEE|5.0|I was very pleased with the condition of the book \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft\\" by Stephen King that I received from this seller. I would be happy to do business with them in the future. Thank you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy are such great books! I'd recommend anyone to read them! If you are reading this book with another group of people who are reading paper back books then if they reference a page number you might have a little difficulty finding it BUT that is the case with all eBooks. Loved this book, it's probably my favorite from the series.
B005XN2ZUC|5.0|Very imaginative. Great twists on old classics, with familiar and new faces. Very addicting! I hate missing episodes... so finding them here on Amazon is great. Thumbs up- I truly hope this DOES NOT get cancelled!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This is one of the best front to back albums I have heard in a very long time. There are a few songs that seem to be vey mediocre, but when given a second and third look bring through much more<br /><br />Some Nights Intro & Some Nights - Ruess definiately channels Freddy Mercury in these fun lead off tunes. A lot of people are turned off by the autotune included in the songs, but the autotune is not used to \\"trick\\" the listener on this album, it is used to give the singer a different tone, which I thought fit nicely ino the tunes.<br /><br />We Are Young - This is an amazingly catch song, I have found myself singing this song out loud to myself, when the song isn't even playing, and Ruess effortlessly pulls of the high notes and sends chills down your spine.<br /><br />Carry On - Starts out with a nice Billy Joel/Elton John piano player feel, very somber, but quickly turns into a anthem of sorts. I can see this being another breakout song for them, it has a great tune and a great message.<br /><br />It Gets Better - all I can say about this song is it is the second weakest one on the album, they act like they want to hang with Avril Lavine in this song, Kudos to them trying to change their sound up even more, but please do not do this again.<br /><br />Why Am I the One - They change right back into the same band we have all come to love, I never realized how much Ruess sounds like Freddy Mercury from Queen, this along with the lead tracks just solidifies his chops as a masterful high tenor singer - this is basically what passes for a love song with *fun.*<br /><br />All Alone - this is tricky song, it has sampling and harpsichord and a very catchy chorus with a snare. This is something the Beatles would have done if they were in this generation i think, think sargent peppers with sampling.<br /><br />All Alright -  Again showing some originality, very singer songwriter song, very good mix of inde sound and hip-hop influnce that they said they used on this album.<br/><br />One Foot - Not a huge fan of this song, this is the worst song on the album, the song sounds like it has feedback the entire song, and almost made my ears bleed, which is unfortunate, the words in this song are amazing.<br /><br />Stars - Good ending for the album, kind of brings it back around to the songs at the beginning of the album, this spot on an album is usually reserved for weaker songs, I feel this is one of their stronger songs, seems pretty mainstream, but this may be what they are looking for at this point.<br /><br />****Bonus**** Out On the Town - This is an awesome song, the tune and words are very catchy, it is one that you will find yourself humming to yourself. Even the echoing affect is pretty sweet, and even though it is pretty mechanical, the singing is still superb.<br /><br />All and all this a great album and I would suggest to any one of my friends I know who love good music and something new and different.
0385343175|5.0|Danielle Steel books are great.  But... in the beginning they are boring, but they<br />certainly pick up towards the middle of the book.

1439152799|5.0|The Forgotten Garden was one of my favorite books, and The Distant Hours does not disappoint!  I would definitely recommend this book.  The plot interweaves the stories of several characters over several generations, and does it easily, just as in The Forgotten Garden.  Kate Morton has such a wonderful way with words, and the characters feel very real.  Just relax and let the book take you--it's a delicious escape and satisfying read.  Can't wait for the next one, Kate!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great way to waste time! tons of simple games that are just challenging enough to not bore you yet good for all ages. have to beat levels to play on.

B0067LXQAW|5.0|Gave this a couple listens over the last few days, I was surprised at how much I had missed the Cranberries.  I am very happy they made it back into the studio. There are no high intensity songs like Salvation, but all the songs are distinct and enjoyable.
B006VR65OQ|5.0|Far better of a film than I thought AND my stream/feed was awesome. Best role I've seen yet for Jonah Hill ... Superbad notwithstanding!
B0053VKP8S|5.0|This is a great little DAC for enabling the use of analogue audio amplifiers with digital devices. The quality, especially considering the price, is great. My only gripe for this little gizmo is that the power cord on the AC/DC adapter might bit a little short for remote wall outlets.
B006H06IJO|4.0|Ok, I'll admit it ... my wife digs JT and I'm a fan of Mila Kunis so it was not a tough choice to rent this one. However, it was actually a pretty good movie! And, as usual, great stream quality for Amazon.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|bought full version. playing on my kindle fire. it's addictive, but I wish it had more video so far...I like to play this game.  it's 1:40am and I have to be up at 5:30. Don't want to put it down!
B000002WYT|4.0|Dave is the favorite band of a lot people, and I can understand that.  To me they are as the Chicago, the band, not the city, of this generation.  Like Chicago, Dave plays songs that meet people at a level on the borderline between jazz and rock.  Some of the stuff is complex.  However, on this album Dave suffers from the same repetition problem.  Over and over, the same thing, and not enough variation.  I enjoyed this album more before I owned than when I actually got it.  When it was new, it seemed that the young folk I was among made Dave their first choice when it came to selecting music, and that made me happy.  Why?  It made me happy because I felt Dave was a band that had talent, and that it was practically a fluke that they were somehow able to produce much record sales.  And, I mean selling a few records, not selling a record platinum many times over.  Hugely popular, and playing music that was still respectable in its level of talent is a rare thing.  This album is every bit as good, if not better than their first effort, \\"Under the Table and Dreaming.\\"  My greatest praise for Crash though is how solid the album is in its entirety.  You don't have to skip songs when you put this one in the player.  So, why 4 stars?  I gave it 4 stars because of the positive impact it had on so many people.  I gave it 4 stars because at a time when most music was fluff, the Dave Mathew's band was producing decent music that was charting.
B0055SWM08|5.0|loved the calmness and style of play. also liked the counter keeping score so you can see what outcome will be. like the game enough to buy the sequel before finishing the initial. peace.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I can hardly think of an album that more deserves 5 stars that Boston's self-titled effort.  There is not any filler at all on this one.  Since its inception across generations, there is no generation that has not embraced this album as being anything but first quality music.  There is something at every moment on Boston's self-titled that is appreciable for anyone.  Even the greatest musical snob breaks down and admits; this album is first quality.<br /><br />Awesome PG rated heavy rock, and with a positive attitude too!  After all these years, that is still hard to come by.  Easily accessible for everyone, from the great musical snob to the musical layman.  Every song on this album is a standard by which all heavy metal songs can be judged.  These songs could easily be turned into symphonies.  The production quality on this album is unbelievable.  Go Boston!  Boston is easily one of Bean Town's rockers!!!  And, I totally dig the line, \\"Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis.\\"  Hyannis is only a few minutes away from where I live.  I'd estimate that I go to Hyannis once a week.  That line has always made me wonder.  Where they dancing in the streets of Hyannis after a gig, and which club did they play their if that's true?<br />This album is a little bit before my time, but what makes it classic, is that if was a new released tomorrow, it would hit the charts and be a best seller for all the right reasons.
0060899220|5.0|This was one of those books that I picked up and felt like I finished in a couple of hours. He draws you in and keeps your attention throughout the book by providing a great image of what it was like to be in the kitchens where he worked and what was happening.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|This single album influenced more musicians than any other album I know of.  Probably hundreds of bands sprung up trying to play music in this style, which is really like Venom on steroids.  And, though the music is aggressive, a musician should be able to appreciate it for its talent.  There are entire record labels that came to specialize in this style of music, and of course Venom are bastards of a songs like Children of the Grave by Black Sabbath.  We all get our ideas from somewhere!  However, Venom is nowhere near as good as this album.  I find no weakness on Reign in Blood, though some tracks are better than others.  My favorite use of this album is to listen to it from start to finish!  Angel of Death, and Raining Blood are standards in the genre.  Sure, there have been albums put out since it that have been better, but it was an original in its time, and nearly impossible to compare anything to it in greatness.  My favorite review of this album actually came from a guitar magazine well over 10 years ago that said something like, \\"Reign in Blood burns with the intensity of 10,000 suns.\\"

B000FC12Z0|5.0|The plot has been summarized by several reviewers so I will not. I read this book before I saw any of the movies based upon it. Christie has three of the most ingenious mysteries I have ever read because she blew all of my assumptions out of the water. They are this one; &#34;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&#34; and &#34;And Then There Were None&#34; (also known as &#34;Ten Little Indians&#34;). Even non-mystery fans should read them. I will never forget the astonishment I felt when I read all three.  This one is my favorite. The Orient Express, especially in the period this book was written (1934) evoked a sense of mystery and intrigue. The cast of characters represented many classes and nationalities, which was an important clue for Poirot, but I will say no more. This book is not dated in IMHO  because it provides an evocative glimpse of a fascinating and often glamorous time (at least for those who travel on the Orient Express).
B007CGLRWA|5.0|I was a high school teacher for awhile, and I suppose I was very lucky. I completely relate to this film, for many reasons. But I did find hope among our young people - hope, courage and the will to bring change. My generation is cynical, we were old and fast friends with death from the beginning. We never expected to make it to 30, collectively. If the Bomb didn't get us, then AIDS, drugs or depression surely would. But this story is not the only one, and I see strong evidence that another, happier story will be written by the children I taught - kids in their late teens, early 20s as I write this review. I hold out great hope for them, that this film will not speak the truth for very much longer.
B004XNPQUO|3.0|Dr. Space would fail this app. Shooting rockets between 2 asteroids caused them to swing like a pendulum between the asteroids. Even when the rockets swung closer to one asteroid &amp; should have changed orbit - they didn't. The physics just feel off &amp; make the game a bit frustrating.
145162445X|1.0|Krauss takes us on a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable journey through various areas of contemporary cosmology (except for an occasional malformed and nearly undecipherable sentence or paragraph). With this background he then seeks to show that universes, and not only particles, can come into being from nothing, meaning absolute non-being. He admits that \\"empty space, endowed with energy\\" (152) which produces virtual particles and possibly inflation is not really this kind of nothing (it's actually \\"something\\"). But then (ch 10) he seeks to cross the great divide and claim that \\"quantum gravity . . . appears to allow universes to be created from nothing--meaning . . . absence of space and time, . . .\\" (170). But we still haven't necessarily reached absolutely nothing. How is it necessary that nothing can exist outside of space and time? Christian theology has long claimed that God exists thus and no one has yet given this claim any solid critique. Krauss seems to assume that with no time or space, all we have left is natural law. However, the laws of nature are merely descriptions of the behavior of matter or energy as determined by their nature. So in this case, as Krauss is describing this kind of \\"nothing,\\" it would be absolutely nothing. But Krauss seems to think natural laws have some distinct ontological status, that they can exist on their own, since he goes on (ch 11) to claim that there can be a kind of nothing that lacks even natural laws and that existence can spring from even this kind of nothing.<br /><br />The problem is that nowhere in either chapter or anywhere else in the book has he been able to demonstrate that he has ever left the old energy fields behind. Obviously he can supply no empirical evidence for his claim. The closest he can get is virtual particles, and everyone admits they come from energy fields and return to energy. It's hard to even imagine how he could ever verify his claim. Magicians who use smoke and mirrors to make people appear out of nothing can be exposed. Scientists know we could never even produce a true nothingness from which Krauss might seek to magically produce his something. He mentions Wilczek's claim that \\"nothing is unstable\\" (159) even though if it were truly unstable it couldn't be nothing. Nothing can be neither stable nor unstable. There is nothing there to be either. He can talk of how he, Afleck, and Vilenkin have produced theoretical models demonstrating creation of existence from true nothingness (168-9) but he still has not shown that it is truly nothing. If he could, he could still not show that any such theoretical or mathematical models reflect reality. We need more than even highly developed and beautifully elegant mathematical models. Numbers can lie as easily as the people who manipulate them.<br /><br />Sydney Harris did a cartoon for American Scientist in which one scientist is showing another a long formula or equation on a blackboard. In the middle of the formula is a phrase something like \\"and then a miracle happens.\\" The second scientist says something like \\"I have a question about just one point in your formula.\\" Krauss' proof for something coming from nothing is essentially the formula in the cartoon, though here it would be more appropriate to change the words to \\"and then magic happens.\\" Because that is exactly what Krauss is doing. Indeed, it's worse than magic. As William Lane Craig points out, when a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat, we at least begin with a magician and a hat. Krauss doesn't even have that! He starts with nothing! No matter how reasonable much of his formula and reasoning appears, sooner or later he has to slip in magic. He has to rely on sophistry that involves a very careful slight-of-hand to conceal his deception. (See my note at the end of this review concerning a popular misunderstanding regarding Harris' cartoon.)<br /><br />He mentions Hartle and Hawking's \\"no boundary\\" approach which posits a universe from nothing (169). But as Craig comments, \\"[this] approach only describes the evolution of our universe from its origin at its `South Pole' to its present state but is silent as to why [or how] the universe came to exist in the first place.\\" We're still stuck with no way to get from nothing to something. (See his full critique of Hawking and Mladinow 's The Grand Design at his ReasonableFaith web site; see question of the week #180 & 181.)<br /><br />Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Can anything be more extraordinary than the claim that something can come from nothing? Yet Krauss gives us no evidence whatsoever. It's as if he is saying, \\"I'm a prominent scientist, you have to trust me. You must think like I think and not like those traditional philosophers and philosophical theologians even though their rationality is just as scientifically informed as my own.\\" If we give in to his demand, then what should we think of those other scientists as capable as himself who reject his claim? What becomes of his claim to special authority? It is far more extraordinary to claim an unexplained, complex, material universe, even assuming that it has always existed, than a simple, timeless, intelligent source of the universe. How much more extraordinary to claim the universe came from nothing?<br /><br />He claims that invoking God to describe how existence came to be is intellectually lazy. He doesn't understand that God, as an uncaused first cause, is not only the best explanation but also that anything else just does not work. We reach this conclusion by the normal scientific reasoning process of comparing alternate hypotheses for their adequacy. As one of many possible examples, we might think of how we have come to accept the existence of dark matter. We couldn't account for the behavior of galaxy clusters unless some unseen matter exists out there. Other hypotheses have been offered but they just aren't as good. But in like manner to see that an uncaused first causeexists is the only adequate explanation of our existence. If, as the BVG theorems tell us, we are stuck with no time, space, matter, or energy and then, somehow, we have our universe, the better explanation is that it came from a simple, intelligent creator rather than from truly nothing. There is nothing lazy about accepting this conclusion.<br /><br />Before closing, let me pick just a few choice quotations for comment found in this book. He quotes Christopher Hitchens: \\"Once you assume a creator and a plan, it makes humans objects in a cruel experiment whereby we are created to be sick and commanded to be well\\" (121). It does certainly involve something of an experiment, but only in the sense that people are free to determine the outcome of the experiment. The plan is for our welfare; and our greatest welfare, our greatest good, could never be attained unless we are free, unless that good is freely chosen. Being free, God could never create us well or complete; we must choose it. So God did not create us \\"sick,\\" only incomplete until we choose the good and choose to accept the God who alone can fulfill and complete us. We could never be truly responsible for our choice unless we are free. There is certainly nothing cruel about this plan, this experiment. Indeed, there is nothing more beautiful or good.<br /><br />The \\"best about what it is to be human,\\" Krauss tells us, is \\"our ability to imagine the vast possibilities of existence and the adventurousness to bravely explore them--without passing the buck to a vague creative force or a creator who is, by definition, forever unfathomable\\" (139). But Krauss had just told us that the universe itself may be ultimately unfathomable as well. As Feinman says, that shouldn't bother us, that doesn't stop us from seeking what knowledge we can attain (177). If with our intellectual search we find the ultimate answer in a Creator, it is certainly not passing the buck to do so. Enough can be known about the Creator to acknowledge, love, embrace, and enjoy this source of all existence. Being unfathomable is clearly no adequate hinderance.<br /><br />\\"The apparent logical necessity of First Cause is a real issue for any universe that has a beginning,\\" Krauss finally admits. But then he goes on to try to make this conclusion seem not too significant. \\"But even in this case,\\" he says, \\"it is vital to realize that this deity bears no logical connection to the personal deities of the world's great religions, . . .\\" (173). Certainly the scientific arguments and the cosmological argument for God do not demonstrate the full characteristics or actions of, say, the God of the Bible; other evidence is needed for that. But the evidence for a timeless, intelligent, powerful source of all existence is also evidence for some of the most primary and important characteristics of a Judeo-Christian God. The first steps have been made for demonstrating the existence of the biblical God, though obviously other kinds of arguments will need to follow.<br /><br />I gave A Universe from Nothing such a low rating despite so much valuable information it shares with us along the way because Krauss is ultimately claiming absurdities and deceiving the gullible. He is correct that intellectual bankruptcy is evident (xiv), but it is in his own thinking, not in theology, philosophy, or serious science.<br /><br />Note: In the original Harris cartoon, the use of the term \\"miracle\\" can be misleading. Harris is carrying over the common assumption among scientists that a miracle is something like a magical or even uncaused event. In fact, a miracle, in at least the best Christian theology, is a normal causal event. Imagine coming across something like a piece of paper with little squares, circles, triangles and similar shapes moving around the surface interacting with each other. Let us suppose these two dimensional creatures are aware of each other and their two dimensional world but not of the third dimension, up and down.If you were to touch the plane of their world, your finger would appear like a small, roughly formed circle growing gradually larger and then gradually smaller as you pulled it out. It would appear to be created out of nothing and then disappear into nothing. You could thus do miracles by moving or changing objects in this world or by adding or taking objects out. This is essentially how God acts to perform miracles in our world. (One doesn't necessarily need this extra dimensions model for miracles to occur but this approach does provide us a possible explanation and other possible explanations would be similar. For more about the flatland idea see Edwin Abbott's 19th century classic, Flatland.)

B004K7HMJ6|5.0|JESSIE J's number ONE in my book and will be for a long time -- absolutely love that girl!  What talent!!!  Her first album is wonderful, although it doesn't do her justice compared to her live -- NO WAY!!!!  But, I would definitely recommend her first album to anyone, yes, go BUY IT!!!!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|well at first looking at the cover I didn't expect much. Definitely with all those b type horror/comedy movies that try to make horror movies funny, but I was surprised. It keeps you wanting to see what happens next. Plus it kept you laughing at the same time. You also get the other perspective from the hillbillies.I would recommend this to anyone that are into comedy horror films.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|This album has quickly become one of my new favorites. I love listening from beginning to end, attempting to milk every last drop of joy from the numerous layers in each track. Nothing on this album is quite as explosive or catchy as their new single, We Are Young, but there are several songs that are just as good, if not better. Buy now.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I was aware of ANGRY BIRDS, but I had never played the game until a friend of mine received an e-reader for Christmas. He let me examine the device and told me to play a few games. I played ANGRY BIRDS. The game is a puzzle game. Basically you slingshot birds (of differing sizes and colors) around to knock over various forms of construction to kill a bunch of pigs. The colors are bright and vivid and the graphics are clear. After playing a few times, I quickly lost interest in this game and am unsure as to why ANGRY BIRDS became such a large fad. However, I would play it again, though not for very long. The game is worth investigating and you might really enjoy it, but I like games with a little more substance.
B004XNPQUO|5.0|Not a perfect game, but for a phone based physics game I am impressed. Physics are a bit off, but not to a point that it breaks the game.<br />I already had Adobe Air, so no issues with me on that. Runs well on my Galaxy SII.<br />On the physics, it might not do what you expect at times but if you pay attention to the results you can start to predict what will happen based on the direction and force you use.<br /><br />I finished the first set of 15 challenges rather easily, level 15 was the most fun and challenging to play. Based on what I've played I would be willing to pay for a sequel if there is ever one.<br /><br />Good job, I would expect better physics from a PC game, but on a phone this exceeded my expectations.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I purchased this as a Kindle book to finish reading the three book set. I got the first two volumes for Christmas. I was visiting relatives on an AF Base, and didn't have access to a book store. The whole set, including this book is a very exciting and suspenseful read that keeps you going until your done. I only gave it 4 stars because it does have some foul language and references to sexual situations, but nothing explicit. You can only blame the author for that. Otherwise the book(s) are so well written that I would buy them all again. The Kindle part was quick, painless, and instant. A few seconds after touching the \\"1 Click\\" button, the book was on my Kindle and I was reading. That part should get 5 stars.

076115678X|4.0|The book encourages you to embrace YOUR natural curls and shows you how to identify what types of curls YOU have and how essentially to care for them. I enjoyed this book much better than the first. I think that the video was important in showing us exactly how to follow the books instructions for washing your hair. For my 3C/4A type hair it was very insightful as to what I should and should not be doing.<br /><br />I should say that this book may be more entertaining than educational for some readers. I have been natural for 3 years now. If you are Newly Natural then this book may be educational for you and I appreciate the book expanding for AA women. With that being said. This book is similar to the first book but there's a section dedicated to African American hair type (This book shows curl types as waves, loose curls and tight curls and then those types have S'wavy, Wavy, Cherub, Botticelli, Corkicelli, Corkscrew, and Fractal or Zizag. The problem is for those people like myself that have two types of hair. So I just try my best to mix the two types and just use what my hair likes best.<br /><br />I should mention that this book does show in detail her haircutting technique as well.  She provides guidelines for trimming your own hair. There are a few Homemade Hair Recipes that are not her own products, so I thought that was good. The No Pooing process advises you to clean your scalp with a bit Botanical or Sulfate/Cone free Conditioner (NEVER Shampoo Curly hair); rinse; then condition your hair again, leaving most of the conditioner in to hydrate the curls.<br /><br />The book also shows you how to wear updo's but I don't recall seeing any styles for TWA's or above the should lengths for AA women. But no worries ladies! We will all be at least at Shoulder length soon!!!! It did also have an area indicating chemicals found in most shampoos.<br />I visted Salon 54 in Peachtree City GA and the owner there cut my hair for me. She has several AA customers and did not do the Deva Cut on my hair but she did trim it for me. I did not want to cut my hair so I will go back in 6 months to see if I think my hair is long enough to cut it into the Deva style and still have hair. Kim
1936850028|3.0|I am about half way through the book and am enjoying the story, however, I find that the story could have used another edit before going to press.  I found myself getting hung up in some of the author's flashbacks and needed to reread many pages to make sure I was following the story correctly.  If you are looking for a good account of what it takes to tackle the Birkie then you will not be disappointed.  If you are looking for a concisely written and perfectly polished novel you might want to look elsewhere.  The book has inspired me to take a long hard look at actually attempting the race in future years, so despite the editorial oversights it is still worth reading.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|Now yes I'm aware that swan song means the end of something and this was the end, With the departure of Head then David Korn utterly lost there sound. Just becuase Johnathan Davis decide to venture into different lyrical territory dosen't mean this isn't Korn this album to me was as strong an outing as they've put forth in awhile, Every element that made Korn such a killer band was here even more so than previous albums. Twisted transistor is an excellent start for this album it all the the qualities you expect from the Korn boys, Politics and Hypocrites have the gnarliest riffs of the whole album. Granted they tried a whole slue of different structures and sounds through out but thats what makes it such a fresh and enjoyable album, Seriously though do you really want to hear the S/T sound again 11 years later. Now everyone wants to throw the whole \\"Not an album for true Korn fans\\" which is horse crap because as I've said before a true fan appretiates when there band actually tries to grow. So if your on the fence about this album take it from not just a Korn fan but a fan of music in general pick it and give it a spin you wont regret it.

It's an excellent book for people like me, since I've just started to experiment with make up a bit more. I love the brush guide at the front of the book, now I actually know which brush is for what, as well as the proper way to apply my makeup.

0061478784|3.0|The first time I ever heard of this book was in 2006 when we lived in St. Louis, MO, and Jackson Pierce, a friend of our younger son Jeremy with whom he played homeschool baseball, gave the following report in the St. Louis Homeschool Network newsletter.  \\"A long time ago, I had seen ads for the movie Howl's Moving Castle.  A few days ago, I saw the book at Borders bookstore, so I bought it.  The book starts: `In the land of Ingary, where things as seven-league boots and cloaks of invisibility really exist, it is quite unfortunate to be born the eldest of three.  Everyone knows you are the one who will fail first, and worst, if the three of you set out to seek your fortunes.'  The main character is Sophie Hatter, the oldest of three sisters.  Her parents own a hat shop in a town called Market Chipping.  She has two sisters.  Her mom died when she was two years old and her sister, Lettie, was one year old.  Their dad married an assistant from the hat shop named Fanny and Fanny had the last baby, Martha.  Now one day, their father died.  Fanny sent Lettie to be apprenticed at Cesari's, a pastry shop in Market Chipping, and Martha to a witch named Annabel Fairfax.  Sophie must stay and work in the hat shop.  It turns out that Martha and Lettie had switched places and used a spell to make them look like each other.  Now it just so happens that there was an evil witch named the Witch of the Waste.  Sophie doesn't know that the woman is the witch at first, and insults her, and when the witch leaves, she curses Sophie into looking (and sometimes feeling) like as woman 90 years old!  So Sophie goes to the one place that could help her: Wizard Howl's Moving Castle.  It's called a `moving castle' because it literally moves around.  The castle had moved near Market Chipping before Sophie had been cursed, so it wouldn't be too much of a walk.  But I'm going to stop here, as not to give anything else away.  The book is very well written, and is kind of long, but it should only take you 2 or 3 days to read it if you are a fast reader.  It is suitable for children of all ages, but that's expected because they made an anime (Japanese animation) movie of it.  If you don't want to be too disappointed by the movie, watch it first (it doesn't look very accurate).  So in conclusion, I think this book is very good and won't put you to sleep when you read it.\\"<br />  That is a pretty good summary of the plot.  A few years later, after we had moved from St. Louis to Salem, IL, we picked Howl's Moving Castle, made from the book in 2004 by Hayao Miyazaki, for a family video.  The film generally follows the book, but as Jackson noted there are some major differences.  I read several reviews by people who actually liked the movie better than the book.  The main complaints about the novel are that it is has poor character development, flimsy story lines, implausible plot devices, and too many words yet not enough real description.  Personally, I found the book well-written and generaly easy to read with a fair amount of excitement, but I did note a few concerns.  First, the plot has an almost \\"absurdist\\" quality to it.  That doesn't necessarily make it bad, but some people may not care for that sort of story.  There are some common euphemisms, such as \\"drat\\" and \\"confound it,\\" a few curse-like terms (\\"damnation\\" and \\"Hell's teeth\\"), and one instance of the word \\"Lord\\" used as an exclamation.  Howl has as reputation as a womanizer, courting girls until they fall in love with him then dropping them for someone else but nothing sexual is actually implied.  References to drinking beer, brandy, and wine occur, and Howl comes home drunk once towards the end.  If you prefer not to have your children reading books which contain magic or witchcraft, you would obviously want to avoid this one.  I do make a distinction between books which I believe promote an interest in the occult, such as Harry Potter, and those where the magic or witchcraft is simply part of thefictional setting of a story.  Howl's Moving Castle comes about as close to the former as possible, and only the \\"absurdist\\" nature of the plot might keep it from falling into that category.<br />  Author Diana Wynne Jones, was born in London, England, on August 16, 1934, the daughter of Marjorie (n&eacute;e Jackson) and Richard Aneurin Jones, both of whom were educators.  She is a British writer, principally of fantasy novels for children and adults, as well as a small amount of non-fiction. Some of her better-known works include the Chrestomanci series.  Her books range from a broad, almost slapstick delight in the construction of absurd-yet-logical situations, especially evident in the endings of some of her books, to sharp social observation, to witty parody of literary forms. Foremost amongst the latter are her Tough Guide to Fantasyland, a non-fiction work on clich&eacute;s in fantasy fiction that has a cult following as a reference among writers and critics, despite being difficult to find due to an erratic printing history, and its fictional companion-pieces Dark Lord of Derkholm (1998) and Year of the Griffin (2000), which provide a merciless, though not unaffectionate, critique of formulaic sword-and-sorcery epics.  Charmed Life, the first book in the Chrestomanci series, won the 1977 Guardian Award for Children's Books.  Archer's Goon (1984), a Boston Globe - Horn Book Honor Book and World Fantasy Award for Best Novel nominee, was adapted for television in 1992.  According to her autobiography, Diana has been an atheist since she was ten.  Howl's Moving Castle won a Boston Globe-Horn Book Award and was named an ALA Notable book for both children and young adults. A sequel, Castle in the Air, was published in 1990. A second sequel, House of Many Ways was released in June 2008.

1612130585|5.0|I haven't read this book, but plan to based on the great reviews. I have a Kindle and will most likely purchase it for $9.99, but I'm just curious about the price of the book. I have never seen a paperback listed for between $85 to $200! Anyone know the answer?
0439023513|2.0|I hated this book! It's been months since I read it and I am still upset. I invested time and money into 3 books just to get THAT ending?! Seriously, I can't help but wonder if Ms. Collins suffered a major crisis during the writing of this book, had a horrific event take place in her childhood or if she is off her meds. Whatever the case, I am certain that a cat peed in her cereal the morning she wrote about Finnick's death. That awful, you say? Yes! and then it all went crashing down hill from there. Impossible you say? One would think..but this author likes shock factor and outdoing one misery with the next, and the next, and the next....<br /><br />Usually when there is such graphic and detailed death and destruction, an author offsets it with something equally as heroic and redeeming in order for the reader to be rewarded for their investment into the depths of hell. But not so with this author. There was lots of awful, and not much of anything else. I didn't feel we were given anything in this story or rewarded at all by reading the book. It just went from bad to worse, to will someone please just slit my wrists and put me out of my misery?!<br />If I wanted a bigger downer than this, I suppose I could have watched an Animal Planet expose' on the clubbing and killing of baby seals...NO THANK YOU!<br /><br />The author can write. I will admit she is very talented. I think she needs to keep a better perspective, however, and not try to beat us over the head with how awful war is and that nothing good comes from it. That is just not the case. My sister in law really had to pester me before I gave in and read this hot new book where kids are forced to kill each other. What an awful premise! Sis said it was really good, however, and I would like it. I should have known better. It truly was well written, but just as awful, senseless and infuriating as I thought it would be. I will steer clear of this authors books in the future. I would have to pick up a script for anti-depressants in order to make it through another book this miserable.

B004UJAOLM|2.0|While I know this is considered a great Classic Romance, I failed to see the romance or the greatness. I decided to read this because I had never done so. I regretted that decision within three chapters. I was determined to finish it to find the wonder of this work that I had heard so much about. I failed to find it in all of it's almost 400 pages. It was a tedious read and nowhere near the great romance I was led to believe. While the last few pages were a payoff, they were not worth the torture of the previous ones.

B005VPRG10|4.0|Being someone who's not in the suggested age range for such a toy, obviously my opinion will be a little different from a kid's.  That said, this piece looks great.  Absolutely badass and is pretty much a must have.  If you can get it for ~$0.10/piece, then go for it.  But, the reason why it's not perfect is the build is absolutely boring as heck.  As is expected given the complexity of the ship itself, and the fact that it's just mainly two big \\"wings\\".  It's definitely wise to build both wings at the same time, but on the other hand, that decreases the length of the build time.  But given how boring a build it is, it's better to just get it over with and get to the final presentation.  Several people have said that it's flimsy, but i've had no problems with mine.  The key is with the final \\"bracket\\" pieces that you slide on to each individual wing before sliding the wing onto the center cockpit piece.  You gotta make sure you press each leg onto the wing solidly and INDIVIDUALLY.  Once you do, this thing isn't gonna fall apart.  If your 8 yr old kid is trying to accomplish this, then that's probably why it's falling apart so easily.  That bracket needs a pretty good amount of force to get the studs into the female receptors.<br /><br />At the end of the day, way too quick a build, but it looks fantastic.  Would love to have a squadron of these, but at the price point, that'd be hard to do.
B004BSFSTA|1.0|So, I was pretty pleased with these headphones; I got them the moment they were available, and they sound really good, very punchy, really solid sound. A few things:<br /><br />1 - They may be called \\"Major\\" and look big in the pictures, but the actual headphones are waaaay smaller than I thought, maybe 2.5\\" square. I had to kind of squish my not large ears to fit in them, and for the first week or so, they were uncomfortable. I was able to break them in, though.<br /><br />2 - The real problem is the joint that connects the headphone to the rest of the frame. The plastic is soft, and literally just comes apart.  I have two pictures, which I will try to post to the product information page, but suffice to say, these headphones are ruined. These headphones lived at my desk--I never moved them, I never folded them up, I just put them on and took them off, but that action wore away the plastic and there was nothing I could do about it.  I am looking at them right now and -- wow, I just picked them up and the entire Mashall faceplate just fell off the headset.<br /><br />They may fix the plastic with enough complaints, but this first generation version of the headphones are not worth your money. This is clearly a quality control problem and is very disappointing.<br /><br />Until they fix the plastic joint, I would strongly recommend not buying these.
1594481717|5.0|I read this book in 2010 admittedly a bit skeptical about all of the hype. After all, how many books live up to this type of coverage and praise? Well, this one does. Pink skillfully synthesizes right- and left-brain thinking in a way that I've never seen before or since. He clearly and compellingly lays out his case for the future of right-brain thinkers--and the perils of only being a left-brain, \\"analysis\\" type. Every professional and college student ought to read this book--twice.
144937980X|2.0|This book seemed to be written assuming that the reader understood Java but then took up pages explaining the for loop, when it could have been explaining things like 2D arrays (this is a graphics, API), mentioning the existence of a while loop, or letting them know about the \\":\\" constant. These were all things that I had to figure out on my own when this book didn't totally failed to bring them up. But worse, they tried to explain the tabs feature of the Processing environment and utterly failed. I would recommend that you become good in Java before spending your time reading this book.

B0063IH60K|5.0|one of the best...I can't stop playing this..I play it Vegas style and it keeps me on my feet. I have tried many different ones and this is the best. Just wish I could win more. Keeps me on my toes!
B005HTC57K|3.0|I wish there was a middle ground between the style of Panda Bear and the style of Oneohtrix Point Never. OPN are a little monotonous, but Panda Bear are so awash in reverb that it requires a substantial amount of patience to sit through. Both are magnificent in their mood evoking qualities, but I have to really hesitate to call them \\"magical,\\" and I regret to say that. I know some people will prefer this to Post-Meriweather Pavilion, but I don't know why. Maybe PMP is just too over-hyped by hipsters, but I have to say that for my tastes I prefer the last Panda Bear album over this one, although I will give him credit because this one sounds less like Animal Collective. I hope it grows on me is all I can say. I'm still a fan.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy is a must read. I loved the characters and the book just pulled me in couldn't put it down wish it took me longer to read as I never wanted it to end.

B000002QWD|5.0|What can you say about Bing Crosby's music - excellent of course.  I love his music and am really a really Christmas fan of music and movies.  I have thorougly enjoyed this CD and would suggest it to anyone.  The seller did exactly as promised and it was shipped to me on time and in good condition.  Would recommend the seller again.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Loved this app. Can get a little boring but over all very fun. Id say ages 8+. I'm 14 and enjoy this game. Probably would not pay more than 99&cent; for it. but luckily it was free :)

1594203334|5.0|I found this book to be well written, fun, and informative.  The poor reviews are based off of the Today show interview, not the book itself.  I would recommend to anyone with kids!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is really addicting  to play!!!!!!!!!<br />I love this game so much I could play it all day!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00785P2QC|2.0|*Update*  There is no way you are going to reach most of the achievements set out by this game without spending money on purchasing investment points.  It's $4.99 for just 55 points!  That isn't going to cover even 10% of the points you will need to build in this game.  I had to take another star away from the game for nickle and diming their customers to keep progressing in their game.<br /><br />Original post below:<br /><br />This is my first experience with G5 Virtual City as I did not play the first release.  I was immediately taken aback by how much they have tied facebook into this game.  I, like many others, am not a fan of social media like FourTwitMyFace.  In future releases a version without, or opt out, of facebook would be appreciated.<br /><br />Having to purchase, or post to facebook, for investment points is truly disappointing.  Why not just charge a nominal fee for the game or let users convert virtual city cash to investment points?  For now I will just play the waiting game and see how long getting it takes to accumulate  points without using the above methods.<br /><br />If the integration of FB or paying for points doesn't bother you then I am sure you will enjoy the game more than I have.

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|If you are a real estate guru as myself you will love this calculator. I used to be at a luncheon with a client and when I tried to calculate a present value on a deal (don't get me wrong i love the original too...) it would take some time. However, with the platinum the processing time is reduced to almost nothing. i'm not saying go and ditch your classic 12C, but if the lil' guy keels over for use grab a platinum.
0439023513|4.0|I pretty much read each book in one day. This 3rd wasn't bad but I would have liked them to have answered 2 questions that popped up in this 3rd book.  I won't say what it was as to not spoil it but it was a good trilogy. Can't wait for the movies to come out.
B004XNPQUO|5.0|All games aren't made for every cell phone. So for you to rate it badly because you have an inferior phone/tablet is just terrible.<br /><br />Devices are like mini computers, maybe you need to upgrade your &quot;System&quot; vs. Complaining about an App.
B005N1OV2O|5.0|I have enjoyed Criminal Minds for years and have watched episode after episode. These actors do such an excellent job portraying their characters to keep the show exciting. Wanting to see a missed episode, I turned to Amazon to fill me in for a small fee. It was well worth the $1.99 to watch this chapter without having to wait for it to come out on reruns.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is awesome you can buy or earn points and the games are nice some are a waste of coins but the higher the game price the better the game
3836531038|5.0|I recently purchased this title and was very pleased. Everything about the book is satisfing. The quality of the paper, binding, the context and content is all great. What I like most about it though is the ethnic diversity in the models. The contrasting shades of women is very refreshing and very much appreciated. I also purchased two other similar books; Ed Fox Vol.2 and Pink Pussy and was very disappointed at the content. Like most other caucasian artists they seem to only be able to show one expression of beauty. I'd have to say, this book is by far the best in terms of model choice and contrast. I also own two other Owe Ommer books and they are just as riveting. I love his work, he is one of the few caucasian artists that isn't one dimensional when it comes to his subjects and the addition of color in his presentations. The lighting and scenary is also on point. If you're into erotic photography with beautiful, sexy women I highly recommend this selection. I would also recommend you check out this artists' other works.
B005ELZKWS|1.0|Or should I say more like Chicken Kiev... full of fillers! Anyway, If you ever had the pleasure of smelling a chicken coop on a hot and humid day.... this is what you're kinda getting here. So lets hold our noses and rip through Chickenfoot III track by track.<br /><br />Note to Chickenfoot: Drop the hippie-dippie peace sign logo..... It just ain't happening anymore!!<br /><br />1. Last Temptation: The opening of this song sounded like something Stone Temple Pilots would have done back in the 90`s. I did manage to get through this mediocre rock song. Won't be returning to it.<br />2. Alright Alright: ( Hit The Skip Button) <yawn><br />3. Different Devil: (Hit The Skip Button) Sounds like Rick Springfield penned this one.<br />4. Up Next: This mid-tempo rocker has Sammy thinking he's going upstairs instead of downstairs shoveling coal. Not a bad song.<br />5. Lighten Up: The opening distorted organ reminds me of Deep Purple in a way. Another mid-tempo rocker. Nothing special here other than Satriani's lead.... Hit the skip button.<br />6. Come Closer: (Hit The Skip Button Fast!) C'mon guys really?? This sounds like a really lame mid 1980's ballad. Hey Michael Anthony... Runnin With The Devil, On Fire, Atomic Punk....what happened brother?<br />7. Three And Half Letters: This is a cool song with good message about hardships in a bad economy....Can't tell if Sammy is going hoarse on this one or it's an effect. This still doesn't make up for track 6!<br />8. Big Foot: Ok, Now we're talking! Snappy little riff drives this one home. Great rocking song and I enjoyed the Zeppelin reference. We'll be returning to this one for sure.<br />9. Dubai Blues: Another mediocre rocker.... Won't be returning to it.<br />10. Something Going Wrong: I'm feeling a little Luke 21:6-28 on this one. This song has a back in the bayou feel to it. (Finger is gently rubbing the skip button)<br />11. No Change (Hidden Track): They're doing a whole lotta lying and I'm not sure who they are. On this one it sounds like they were trying for an early Van Halen feel with Joe's guitar panned hard left and echoing right. This should have opened the record.<br /><br />With all the religious overtones on this album it does seem like Sammy or someone in the band is searching. In my opinion that's a good thing.<br /><br />I do give this album a four star rating for mix & mastering production, It's not overly compressed with virtually no digital clipping & distortion. Once in awhile you'll hear some hard limiting. Great Job on sound.<br /><br />Compared to their now rivals Van Halen and with all the trash talking from Sammy last year. I now listened to both albums and I must say Van Halen's A Different Kind Of Truth smokes this album tenfold. I feel Chickenfoot III won't stand the test of time and by next year you'll see it in the bargain bin.<br /><br />Hopefully Chickenfoot II will be better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fantastic book and series!  I highly suggest it.  I read all three in a matter of a couple days, really keeps your attention.

B005OCFGTO|2.0|I was upset to see that when I got the harry potter box set in the mail that the case it was in was broken. When I opened up the package plastic pieces from the case fell onto the floor. I immediately got it ready to return. Maybe if it was packaged better it wouldn't have broken. I hope next time I order it this won't happen again.
1568490119|5.0|The book cam on time and in great condition.  I had read this book twice before, once in college and again about 20 years ago. I had lost my copy and was glad to have found a replacement
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got this for free, and I love it.  it is super fun to play for a few minutes out of each day then go on to something else.

042524489X|5.0|Just finished it and loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Hawke and Sienna, what can I say for this couple? Their relationship has been building since book 1 althought without the frustration of unfulfilled passion.<br /><br />SPOILERS!<br /><br />Hawke is one kick ass, hard core alpha! I mean the guy runs the wolves (how more of a badass can anyone be?) and he's been alone forever, since he was one of the rare wolves that matted in the age of 10 but one of the unfortunate that lost that mate too early. His heart never overcome that loss and he is totally sure that he is never to be mated again.<br /><br />And then comes Sienna, we've met her at Book 1Slave to Sensation, she is 17, she is one dangerous Psy and is pushing all the right buttons Hawke has! even though there is no mention of anything sexual, not until book 6 Branded by Fire but since then my heart was torn to pieces for them.<br /><br />in their book for the first half my heart was working overdrive, Hawke didn't want to acknowledge Sienna's feelings and he thought is was just a childish infatuation, but then with a little help from the certain recipe of jealousy he did make a claim on her.<br /><br />I respect Sienna! it could have been a game of an immature mind but no it turned out to be the strength to support the right idea when everyone says otherwise.<br /><br />I really loved all the side plots.<br />I loved Judd all over again, he was everywhere he was needed a presence so critical even more of the rest of the lieutenants.<br /><br />I absolutely adored Walker and Lara, who could have thought that Walker could be a volcano of possessiveness and passion!<br /><br />I almost melted when Sascha gave birth to little Nadiya Shayla and the balance with Nikita so strange and yet so right.<br /><br />I love the relationship the two alphas share, I mean those two guys are hilarious when together (even better when apart fluffy handcuffs).<br /><br />I really want to know more about the Arrows Aden and Vasic (he is taking Jax to silence his conscience, that's so no Silent) and I missed Kaleb (never thought I'd say that).<br /><br />Since its Valentines Day I'll finish this review with Hawke's words to Sienna.<br />\\"You are my every breath and every thought, intertwined so deep inside me that love's not a strong enough word-you have my devotion, your name branded on my soul, my wolf yours to command. A hundred years? It'll never be enough. I want eternity.\\"he is taking Jax to silence his conscience, that's so no Silent) and I missed Kaleb (never thought I'd say that).<br /><br />Since its Valentines Day I'll finish this review with Hawke's words to Sienna.<br />\\"You are my every breath and every thought, intertwined so deep inside me that love's not a strong enough word-you have my devotion, your name branded on my soul, my wolf yours to command.

B006QKKMBA|3.0|Watched it with my 12 year old son who thought it was great that's a big clue right there how it was.<br />I however thought it was not as good as some of the other final destination films<br />1st and 2nd ones were my favorites. Did like the eye laser part that was very orginal. Happened to get it when it was on sale for 1.99 so that was good glad I didn't see it in the movies.
B0012PDVQ2|4.0|This movie is a bit hard to understand if you do not know any background or have not read the book. Those with the deductive skills to understand things without prior knowledge will be tested. Anyways, It is an incredible movie. I vision of the future from the zeitgeist of the 1980's. It is the last scifi movie to use only analog special effects (effects that arn't digital), and directed my the legend Ridley Scott. The movie has such an atmosphere and mood to it. It catches you right off the bat.<br /><br />My bluray case was broken in the corner when it arrived. I'm not sure who is to blame for that though.
B0068TL23G|4.0|This is such a challenging game and I love it.  I've been using it on my Kindle Fire and it works just fine.  I went back and re-did some stages just because I wasn't satisfied with the low score I made on some, and it worked fine for that too.  Now, however, I'm stuck on Chapter 8 Stage 7 . . . . have been trying to solve it for a couple of weeks now and am beginning to think there isn't a solution.  Did anyone else out there solve it yet??  This is the only reason I gave it a 4-star rating.  IF I every solve it, maybe I can come back and re-rate it.  :-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it! clear and concise rules even my kids love to play this game! comparable to the actual card game
B0063IH60K|4.0|only draw back is having to delete the adds in the beginning.  But it is not hard to close the adds and they only appear in the beginning.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|There is one sign that tells me just how good a book is: can I, and will I, sit and read a book until I finish, get bored, or pass out from exhaustion. As of about a month ago, the  best book I have read, by those standards, is The Hunger Games. I read all three novels in one sitting. However, this book has made the list. I started reading at about 8:00, and passed out around 3:00, 750 or so pages in. While some of his books are pretty bad, books like these are what makes me agree  with many of his fans that he is the geatest novelist of all time. This book, like many of his others, take an overly cliched idea an turns it into something amazing. What I love about him most is that he takes all the nitty gritty details tht you love to hate and makes them almost fun. The cameos from past( and most likely future) novels were fun, and the story a great one. My only complaint: the aftermeth of the shooting sucked. I mean,I just read 1100 freaking pages of the past, I kind of wast to read the thing tht actually made me want to read this book: the aftermth. I'm just saying, at least 100-150 pages on life withot the asassination. other than that, it was amazetastic.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I can't put in words how much I love this app! They could probably charge more and get away with it. I see all of my movies and listen to all of my music without a glitch.
B00783NPVI|1.0|I got the box today, and yes I do understand that you don't get a real flower in the box, but I expected at least a flower that looks at least a little bit like the flower on the picture. My flower is absolutely not anything like it. Not even remotely. Really sad that I spend money on this.<br /><br />If you want Breaking Dawn, just buy the regular dvd/blu ray or the other special edition. Stay far away from this one!
B0061TQBRK|4.0|For those familiar with this band, there doesn't seem to be much new here on first listen, but the goodness does come out.  Clearly, their quirky Italian brand of gothic metal is an acquired taste, but they continue to assert their uniqueness in new ways.  This go-around they return to advanced composition underlying their how-much-is-too-much-blood-on-the-ground themes.  The highlight for me:  Andrea's raspy yells and Cristina's vulnerable vocal soarings combine in harmonies not found in nature.  Listen for them - quite a treat.
B0061S073A|5.0|I have a child using an app for communication. I am able to have her use the Fire as a communication device primarily but can allow her game access as a treat. Wonderful!

B000GIXLO8|4.0|I bought this because it was the extended version. Thinking it had all the scenes. I found out it also has the Theatre Version. It was missing the part where the spirits skulls pour out from their city inside the cave and where their leader meets with them outside the cave to say they will join the fight. I love the series, and just recently was able to view the real extended version with all scenes.
B005EM8O8O|5.0|An entertaining read, but the cinematic descriptions of the house, the office, the hotel, the action, all of it, just cry  out to be made into a movie.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Not everyone's cup of tea, but I found this one really interesting and very cool.  Deliberate pacing with explosions of violence that catch you off guard.  It took me a while to get used the Refn's stylized, 80's like directing choices but then I found myself really digging it.  In summary, a stunt driver moonlights as a \\"getaway\\" driver for lowlifes.  He gets tangled up with one of his neighbors and ultimately dragged into a robbery gone bad.  It puts him on the run from some mean thugs lead by Books. Gosling is good playing the quiet, minimalist, but deadly (scorpion) driver for hire.  Brooks got an Oscar nod for his role as a likable but dark mobster.  Violent to some extremes but very cool.  Definitely check it out but make sure your data is ready to cover their eyes during a few scenes....
B0002WZTPC|5.0|the movie was great to see again. plus the bonus disk had a bunch of learning tips about the air force and navy. My children even enjoyed it so much that my oldest is planning on join the air forces....... i have to say if you havent seen this movie before they need to watches....
1451648537|5.0|I have read the biographies or auto-biographies of many business leaders such as Jack Welch, Ray Kroc, Sam Walton, Thomas J. Watson Jr., Thomas J. Watson Sr., Alfred P. Sloan, Tony Hsieh, William C. Durant, Lee Iacocca, Robert Noyce, Chester Carlson, Gordon Bethune, Lou Gerstner, etc., etc.  From most of them I obtain tons of ideas that I many times steal shamelessly and apply in my corporate position.<br />However, even before begining to read Steve Job's biography I knew this time it was going to be different.  And it was.  His biography is as, or maybe even more, interesting than any of the others, BUT the takeaway is very meager because the others were outstanding business leaders but not geniuses.  Steve, on the other hand was a GENIUS like the business world had never seen and will (probably) never see again.<br />The only (sort of) exception I've ever encountered is precisely one of Steve's business heroes: Edwin Land.  His most comprenhensive biography is not surprisingly titled: Insisting on the Impossible.  And yes, I have to concede Land achieved the impossible one or two times but he doesn't even come close to Steve.

B006BQM762|3.0|I was expecting more out of this film by the minds that created the film, but I was dissappointed. It was missing something and it ended to quick. Although it is a pretty neat sci-fi story thats never been done.
1400052181|5.0|Wow, this was an awesome book! It discusses the life of Henrietta Lacks, the donor of the tumor that was used to develop the immortalized cell line HeLa. The narrative alternates between the story of Henrietta's family and a scientific discussion of the HeLa's huge contribution to modern medicine. This is by far the most human story of science/medicine I've ever read. Everyone should read it! Additionally, the audiobook won the Audie Award because of its excellent performance.
B003Y3ZHUS|5.0|This is one of my favorite Mario Bava films except Black Sunday, (that's his masterpiece). The blu ray transfer is stunning and the audio is supberb too.
0545425115|3.0|In a post-apocalyptic country called Panem, The Capital takes two children as tributes from each of its 12 Districts for an annual reality-TV survival competition. The children must fight until there is only one survivor. I understand why this book is so popular. Collins is a fantastic writer--the plot was fast-moving, suspenseful, and creative; the characters were well-developed and likable. However, I did not like this book. The idea of kids being forced to murder kids for entertainment is disturbing and tasteless as far as I'm concerned. It didn't work for me in Lord of the Flies and it didn't work for me in The Hunger Games. I thought about continuing with the rest of the series, but it would appear from the reviews that the next two books are just as violent, so I guess I don't see the point. I do really appreciate that it was very exciting and well-written though. I practically read it in one sitting despite my disgust at the premise. It deserves 1-2 stars for the premise and 4-5 stars for the writing, so I gave it 3.
B002ZDAD9I|5.0|I love this film and had been waiting for a blu-ray copy to come stateside. But I found out this version will only play on B encoded players, such as ones in the United Kingdom.
0375714839|4.0|Persepolis is a graphic memoir about Marjane Satrapi, a young \\"modernized\\" girl growing up in Iran during the Islamic revolution. Due to the trials of being an outspoken modern girl in this oppressive regime, she must leave her family and live alone in Austria to finish her education. There, she loses herself before finally coming to terms with her own identity. It was a heartbreaking memoir. The story and art were very dark, but humorous as well. I thought this book would be for young adults, but feel it would appropriate only for a VERY mature teenager. It has topics such as torture, rape, violence, and drugs. It was very educational about the revolutionary regime, though I don't know how biased it is.
B005R32L66|1.0|VERY DISAPPOINTED with both SKYPE and KINDLE FIRE.  This is a very important app to me as some of my family lives over seas. I bought the kindle for reading books and hoping to use to voice skype to my family. DOES NOT WORK.  The skype only works with IMO for texting, but NO talking.  Kindle should resolve this issue asap.  I am very disappointed in the lack of use of Kindle compared to even my daughters ITouch. I understand the IPAD also does MUCH MUCH MORE.
1439170916|4.0|The Emperor of All Maladies is a sweeping \\"biography\\" of cancer covering archeological/ancient history to present-day. It is very well-informed, well written, and thorough. Definitely worth a read for anyone who is interested in the history of cancer or medicine. Well-deserving of the Pulitzer Prize it won in 2011. I think it was written with the popular reader in mind (he DOES tell us what DNA is at the beginning of the book), but the book quickly delves into terminology and topics that I suspect would be very heavy to someone who doesn't already know a little about biology/medicine. This is especially true in the second half of the book. Mukherjee also is SO thorough that the book becomes extremely long, which is difficult for those of us with a short attention span. Also, I got great amusement out of his formulaically inserted personal patient pieces. It was good that he had them (they broke up the difficult scientific passages) but I could tell that they were written by a scientist and not a journalist (i.e. they were comprised of literal rather than emotive descriptions). Being a scientist myself, this made me chuckle (alas! an emotion). However, I think the personal patient pieces were interesting and elicited enough emotion to engage the readers. They worked for me, anyway
B003XU7IFY|3.0|While Noam Chomsky has much valuable insight into the workings of the social machine, he is not afraid to follow some of his thoughts off a cliff.  Conspiracies DO exist amongst the powerful, but they are not nearly as organized and absolute as Chomsky seems to think.  We live in a sloppy world in which the well-connected exercise an inordinate amount of power, but I disagree that they get together at regular intervals to plot their next moves.  Those who exercise power do so largely because most people are too lazy to do anything to prevent them.
0753801728|4.0|15-year old Michael has a love affair with an older woman, who then disappears leaving him with uneasy feelings of guilt and abandonment. Years later, he discovers that she was a guard at Nazi concentration camps. While he attends her trial, and in the years following, Michael explores what it means to love someone who has done terrible things. For me, this was a new way to view the Holocaust, and so the story was very interesting. However, it's not the type of book I generally enjoy, so this is the only reason I gave it a lower rating. I think it's a very well written and thought-provoking book.
B0001I562I|5.0|Both my kids loved this movie. 12 year old David walks into the woods to meet his younger brother and finds his life has taken an unexpected turn. Borrowed by MAX for a life study project the alien returns him eight years later, unchanged, while the rest of the world has aged. His 8 year old brother is now 16. Invited by NASA to undergo some testing to determine just where he has been for eight years David takes flight to rejoin his life in 1978. This movie is pure magic. Great fun for young and old alike.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|I must admit I dragged my heels a bit when it came to buying this lp, after the disappointing Volta I thought my adoration of Bjork was long over. However out of pure loyalty I endeavoured to buy it and give Bjork one last chance. How pleased i am that I did this! This is the best lp Bjork has made in a long time. With that unique sense of wonder at the world that only Bjork can convey, the lyrics are pure poetry, the instrumentation experimental yet always perfect and Bjork's voice as amazing as ever. I thoroughly recommend this to everyone. Bjork you are an inspiration.
B005SNP6FS|2.0|I watched this movie for one reason Colin Farrell. With out him I would have given it only one star. Crummy plot and actors that speak in such thick British accents that you can not understand the dialog with out the subtitles. Hated the ending. Wasted 2 hours of my life on this one.
B004QK5N5W|3.0|Like other reviews, this thing does it's work. IMHO it's overpriced, just about every iThing sold out there, but what the heck.<br /><br />I plugged this adaptor into my iPad 2 and connected it via HDMI to my 32\\" LCD. It does not fill up the screen, even in tilting the iPad into landscape. At least the display runs at a good resolution for not being FullHD.<br /><br />Connected the same cable to my iPod touch 4th generation, with no luck. It doesn't show error, the TV just shows \\"no signal\\" .. as long as it works on my iPad it's OK.<br /><br />Now what I expected though.

B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|Shows the tale of Oakland A's General Manager Billy Bean. Nitch-market baseball info, it is watchable because Brad Pitt breaths a little life into the story, probably the most engaging storyline is his relationship with his daughter.<br /><br />We see statistics flashed up on the screen, oh boy. Jonah Hill plays against character playing a straight-shooter numbers guy that Billy hires to find unknown ball players that fit a certain numbers-driven profile that can be successful on the ballfield.<br /><br />We also see flash backs of Billy's life and his personal struggles to be sucessful himself when he was a player.<br /><br />The A's do manage to start doing some winning after Billy trades Art Howe's favorite first baseman Carlos Pena (so Carlos eventually ends up with the Rays as an All-Star) so Scott Hattiburg can play firstbase. Carlos is STILL in the league, where  is Scott?<br /><br />Its a feel-good story as the A's win a league record 20 games in a row, #20 being over the K.C. Royals after the A's were up by 10 runs, their lead slips away, we get to see the whole thing.  Why they did not just use file footage of the game and insert it between shots is beyond me, rather, we get to watch people who are supposedly the Royal players going through the motions.<br /><br />At the end though, just like the book, of course.  All of Billy's prognostications don't work in the post-season. they work over 162 games, but not in a short series.<br /><br />This is a character study, there are shots where we just see Billy/Brad just driving his truck, listening to the radio. Is THAT a movie? Or is that something a lonely person would put on as a UTUBE video?<br /><br />For an actual movie (art imitating life check out [[ASIN:B000HV9PH6 Tiger Town]] or if you want a baseball tale see [[ASIN:6300270092 Blue Skies Again [VHS]]] [[ASIN:B0006GAI64 Mr. 3000 (Widescreen Edition)]] and /or [[ASIN:B00009AOAW Mr. Baseball]]. The list is virtually endless as to the available options. Ok, none have Brad Pitt. See, thats the thing, this is basically a vehicle for Brad to have a relationship with the camera.

B0012GMXYM|5.0|Santana's sixth studio album `Borboletta' was released in October 1974, exactly 24 months after `Caravanserai'. In musical style and overall feel, `Borboletta' echoes `Caravanserai' more than either album resembles the intervening clean-jazz sound of the 1973-released `Welcome'.<br /><br />This is the original vinyl album of 'Borboletta' from 1974.<br /><br />`Borboletta' has a richness of texture and complexity of sound probably unmatched by any of the band's previous or subsequent releases; it's truly a creative high-point. Its style can be described as essentially jazz-rock fusion but with a heavy Brazilian influence; Brazilian musicians Flora Purim (who guested as a singer on the `Welcome' album) and Airto Moreira made a deep impression on Carlos and strongly influenced the sound, instrumentation and production.<br /><br />Even more than on `Caravanserai' long instrumental pieces predominate, with the keyboards of Tom Coster and the superbly atmospheric soprano sax of Jules Broussard establishing the mood as often as Carlos's guitar, which exhibits the taste and maturity of a truly great musician. The by-now trademark complex percussion underpinning Santana's music here reaches a new level of understated subtlety with Armando Peraza, Chepito Areas, Michael Shrieve and Airto Moreira weaving beguiling patterns with a strong Brazilian flavour.<br /><br />The highlight of the album for most fans is a 13.28 three-part instrumental suite culminating in an epic reworking of Dorival Caymmi's `Promessa de Pescador' (`Promise of a Fisherman'). The music shifts seamlessly through minor-key and tempo changes, building through the progressively insistent main theme to a truly symphonic crescendo of sound over driving multi-percussive rhythms, overlaid by Carlos's wailing guitar and with Coster's superb electric piano playing the perfect conversational counterpoint. It's a truly great jazz-fusion piece in the mould of 'Flame Sky' and 'Every Step of the Way'.<br /><br />The rest of the album is better than good, but suffers a little in comparison with the sublime `Here and Now/Flor de Canela/Promise of a Fisherman' suite. The Santana band's lyrics on their few vocal numbers during this period were once memorably described by Bob Palmer in `Rolling Stone' magazine as \\"sincere but simplistic cosmic drivel\\" and this unfortunately is not too wide of the mark on `Borboletta', particularly on the funky numbers `Give and Take' and `Practice what you Preach' (are most rock/pop music lyrics really any `better'?). However, the A-list jazz and rock musicians assembled around Carlos for these sessions play together with great sensitivity and virtuosity and manage to weave deep, dark magic as an ensemble. This is fine, intelligent and engaging music played with feeling, and with first class production values.<br /><br />The cover-art of `Borboletta' continues the imaginative artistic tradition of earlier Santana releases. Intended as a reference to Purim and Moreira's classic `Butterfly Dreams' album, the shiny electric blue pattern has a small butterfly motif at its centre, striking in its simplicity. With the 12\\" vinyl album cover, you get to appreciate this in all its glory.st of the album is better than good, but suffers a little in comparison with the sublime `Here and Now/Flor de Canela/Promise of a Fisherman' suite.

The story moved at a great pace: not so quickly that the story line wasn't developed, but not so slowly that it was boring and bogged down by unnecessary dialogue or details.  This story had a little bit of a mystery in it that was well thought out.  It kept me interested in what was going to happen/be discovered next.  The characters were realistic and relatable.  Best of all, the story was fun to read.  This is the first book I've read in a while that I was sad to finish; I wanted it to keep going.  I have read and enjoyed all of Sophie Kinsella's books.  This book is by far my favorite of hers.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Emotional and imaginative -that's how the final entry in the enormously popular Toys  trilogy is described in Netflix, and I can't agree more. Who would have thought that one of the very best and most exciting films of the 2010 in the genres action adventure / thriller perfectly and brilliantly mixed with the comedy and touching drama would unfold in the playroom of the regular Anywhere, US suburban kindergarten. Who would have imagined that the bravest, most resourceful, loving, loyal, and lovable  heroes of this adventure will be plastic and metal toys?<br /><br />How often does it happen that not even the first but the second sequel in the popular series will surpass two excellent predecessors on all counts and become a rare film, that would make  even the most ironic and sarcastic male critics who could tear any movie to pieces with their harsh criticism  shed a tear and not be shy to admit it?<br /><br />A very smart person said once: \\"You need to write for  children like you would for adults,  but even better.\\" Toy Story, Part 3 is  Toy Story, Part 3 is drawn,  programmed, staged, CGIed  and acted  with such brilliance, talent and joy that every viewer, regardless of age becomes a child and is immersed in an extraordinary world of adventure, where one for all and all for one.  By the end of this adventure, the viewers are  left with very special and touching emotions, and realize that they experienced one of the most beautiful and realistic movies about growing up, moving on, and saying goodbye.<br /><br />Bravo Disney, bravo Pixar, bravo American cinema!

B0000021RD|5.0|If The Beatles defined popular music in the 60's, then Chicago undoubtedly defined popular music in the 70's.  Chicago was the leading US singles charting group of the entire decade.  Thier body of work is virtually unrivaled, however, they were so much more than your typical hit making machine and this album is concrete proof of that.  My first real experience wih Chicago 2 was when I was sick in bed.  I was about 22 at the time and while laying in bed my dad decided to put this cd on while  working on something around the house.  My father being the huge Chicago fan that he is had played this cd in the past so I was certainly aware of it but at this point failed to notice the sheer mastery and skill behined this cd and band.  The first side of this LP is a collection of top notch pop songs with superb harmonies and catchy hooks,  Wake Up Sunshine finds Robert Lamb at his most paul MCcartny and is problaly my favorite number out of this group of songs.  Then we get to the part that makes this album the masterpiece that it is.  Chicago's multi suite epic Make Me Smile is a flawless peice of music and one of Chicagos all time highlights in thier entire body of work.  Terry Kaths vocals are as rusty and soulful as ever, Being backed by one of the best rythym sections ever just accentuates his phenomenal singing.  This track is interspersed with amazing insturmaental jams that are as progressive as jazz rock got at the time.  Color My World an obvious highlight brings this track to a slower key without taking you out of the sweeping elements that started in the begining.  parazaiders flute solo is as beautiful as ever on this one.  Things come full circle in the toe tapping climax that is Now More Than Ever, \\"I dare you to sit still during this part of the song\\".  This is also the album that gave us the timeless rocker 25 or 6 to 4, Chicagos first top 5 hit.  The Guitar riff on this track is legendary and Peter Ceteras tenor vocals are as urgent and soaring as ever.  This is the most accurate song about cocaine use ever and was actually not even about cocaine! Go figure.  Kaths guitar solo does not even need to be mentioned, it is one of the most devestating face melting guitar solo in the history of rock and roll. When Hendrix takes his hat off to you, you know your good.  Next comes the most overtly jazz offering, a 4 part mostly insturmental suite that is very chillout but nothing extrordinary.  It Better End Soon finds chicago at thier most political.  This is yet another suite focusing on ending war.  I love the horn section on this piece.  The album ends with Ceteras beautiful ballad Where Do We Go From Here.  If you are new to Chicagos older stuff than I cannot recommened this album enough!
006197806X|4.0|Pandemonium is book two in Lauren Oliver's trilogy Delirium.  Having recently finished book one, I was anxious to get my hands on this novel.  Oliver delivered with Pandemonium and left me yet again craving more. She took me on an intense ride that had my palms sweating and my heart racing.<br /><br />The novel picks up after Lena has been in the wilds, and the author cleverly takes us between then (her experiences in the Wilds since escaping) and now (what is currently happening to her).  Oliver simplifies this by splitting the chapters between then and now.  It was easy to follow, but a few times I felt like only reading now or vise versa when the plot became too intense.<br /><br />In the chapters depicting then, we meet Raven,Tank and many more inlanders.  Lena is injured and in a bad way at the beginning. Deep down she knows Alex is dead, but cannot admit this. Life is hard in the wilds, but Raven teaches Lena how to survive. Here we watch Lena mature, find her inner strength and grow into the character we see in now.  The world that Oliver paints here is a tough and beautiful one. There is a beauty to the harsh landscape. The people are leaner, depend on each other and have made make shift communities.  Despite how hard survival is in the wilds, Lena finds peace here. These people become her make shift family.  I really liked these unique characters. Oliver made them each individuals and gave them voice.<br /><br />The chapters that are dedicated to now are intense as Lena and the others assume identities within Manhattan, NY.  They are following the movements of the DFA (a group that encourage young people to seek the Cure).  At one of their rallies, Lena meets Julian, the son of the DFA leader.  He is not yet cured, but is eighteen. Medical circumstances have prevented him from the procedure, but he tells the youth group he will have it done at the convention.  Lena is told by Raven to keep an eye on Julian \\"no matter what\\" at the gathering in Times Square. Lena and Julian are captured by a protester group, and the tale that unfolds is fast paced, action packed and romantic. Together they must find a way to escape their captures. Julian begins to have feels for Lena and Lena for the first time feels alive. She has feelings for Julian, even though it feels like a betrayal to Alex. I found myself swept up in their story.<br /><br />The tale that Oliver weaves between the then and now is spectacular. I couldn't get enough and just when I thought things would work out, that we could all breathe a moment....Oliver drops a bomb shell on the last few pages and ends the book with a major cliffhanger. I was mad, but then I was excited, and then I was rushing to Goodreads to see when the next book will be available. I love when a book has me this engaged and I cannot wait to read the next book.Lena and Julian are captured by a protester group, and the tale that unfolds is fast paced, action packed and romantic.

B000YDCFRE|5.0|I got these boots because I liked how they looked rather than the recyclable materials they are made out of. The leather is very soft and supple feeling broken in from day one which contributes to the comfort of the boots. The sole is nice and grippy without being too bulky but the sole is pretty soft leading me to believe that they might wear quickly. The good part is that they can be resoled with Vibrams so theres nothing to worry about there. The footbed is very comfortable, and as I said before these boots felt like I had been wearing them for years the day that they arrived. Couldn't ask for anything more. Just be sure to buy at least a half size if not a whole size smaller than you would normally wear in other brands. I typically wear between a 9.5 and 10 and I had to return my 9.5 for a 9.

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|\\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" John Ford's unforgettable 1940 drama, is a spiritual horror film. I had never before read John Steinbeck's famous novel ([[ASIN:0143039431 The Grapes of Wrath]]) and finally sat down to watch the film one dark night with the lights turned off. It terrified me. An uneducated farming family is thrown off of their land and they must travel thousands of miles through an apocalyptic, uncaring world. Like famous pioneer wagon trains before them, they suffer through the death of family members, starvation and ridicule, all the while slowly migrating towards what is supposed to be a California American Eden.<br /><br />In his most famous performance, Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a recently paroled convict walking alone on the highway towards his parents' Oklahoma farm. Joad encounters a preacher who has lost the faith (John Carradine, in what is most likely his most famous role as well), and together they travel the barren land. They arrive to find Tom's home abandoned. An endless drought has rendered the land into a dust bowl and the Depression ([[ASIN:0812923278 The Great Depression: America 1929-1941]]) has robbed sharecroppers of their livelihood. With a wind continuously howling, they stay in the lonely house for the night. By the light of a candle, they discuss their uncertain future and are visited by a haunted neighbor whose farm has been bulldozed by bankers. He now roams the land as a pauper, a \\"ghost in a graveyard.\\"<br /><br />These opening scenes are disturbing, portraying hopeless men forgotten by a bankrupt American society. Their way of life - sharecropping a small farm, a lifestyle existing for centuries - has abruptly come to an end. Tom finds his family at his uncle's neighboring spread, where he famously smiles for the first time when encountering his mother (Ma Joad, played by Jane Darwell in an Oscar-winning performance). They are loading up a creaking 1926 Hudson truck with all of their possessions, grandparents and children, andheading for California armed with a flyer promoting 800 jobs for fruit pickers. Unknown to them, tens of thousands of people are traveling the same route armed with an identical flyer.<br /><br />There was time when \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was considered the greatest American film ever made ([[ASIN:0520063341 John Ford: The Man and His Films]]), an epic work portraying the struggles of common people surviving terrible hardship. It still packs a heavy punch, though is downgraded today for broadly drawn characters bordering on caricature. Youthful critics find the Joad's mode of travel comedic. And conservatives dislike the film's politics involving unions and the scent of Socialist attitudes. Steinbeck praised the work, a rare vote of confidence for Hollywood from a major author. The film was made in 1939, two years before the outbreak of World War II effectively ending the Depression. People were still traveling Route 66 ([[ASIN:087358855X Route 66: Spirit of the Mother Road]]) for the California promise land and several loaded down trucks akin to the Joad's were in fact driving the same on-location route and used for background footage.<br /><br />I found the scenes at the pauper camps, where gangs of starving children surrounded the Joad's campfire, to be deeply troubling. America portrayed as a Third World country is not the stuff of fantasy or romance. But if you look at the famous 1936 Dorothea Lange photograph of a mother and her children ([[ASIN:0714846198 Dorothea Lange]]), you know Ford was not far from the truth. Personally, I am the son of a woman who grew up on a sharecropper's farm and recall childhood family reunions when aunts and uncles discussed mule-drawn wagons and walking several miles to school. Grandparents, some of whom were suffering from Alzheimer's akin to this film's Grandpa and Grandma (Charley Grapewin, Zeffie Tilbury), had to be cared for with great love and tolerance. I knew the film's characters and understood their frustrations and insecurities.<br /><br />I recall traveling with these family members and how they would reroute a long journey to bypass urban areas. My uncles wore overalls like the Joads. They listened to Bob Wills, very much akin to the rural ballads (\\"Going Down the Road Feeling Bad,\\" \\"Red River Valley\\") of this film. Within me, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" struck a deeply mournful chord. Ford gets so much right with his heartbreaking portrayals, and the extraordinary detail of set decoration mixed with authentic on-location footage creates an unparalleled documentary of an American time and place. Cinematographer Gregg Toland (who would go on to great fame with [[ASIN:B0050G3NWG Citizen Kane (70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]] two years later) deserves credit for shooting some of the most vivid scenes in history. Solemn travelers surrounding campfires or an impromptu roadside funeral resemble works of American Regionalist art ([[ASIN:0299155846 Renegade Regionalists: The Modern Independence of Grant Wood, Thomas Hart Benton, and John Steuart Curry]]).<br /><br />Perhaps the most haunting scene is the family traveling by night across the deadly expanse of the Mojave Desert. By the light of the moon, sinister Yucca trees pass the windows and children stare from the apparent safety of the truck bed, amazed at the solemnity of the land. The Joads pray for the truck to cross the endless desolation before sunrise, alone on an odyssey but for the unity of each other. They say \\"Citizen Kane\\" supplanted this film as the greatest in American history. From where I sit, the roots of \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" go much deeper into the soil.
0446310786|5.0|It's amazing to read a story like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and see how \\"good white people\\" treated \\"Negros\\".  No wonder there were race riots and protests.  It seemed like I was reading about a different country, not the good ole USA.  I know this was not a true story, but I'm sure it was based on what was going on all those decades ago.  How sad to see things like that happening; I'm glad things are different in 2012. CGR

082300659X|4.0|Good foundational book.  Would work well with Tony Ryder's book, \\"The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing.\\"  I recommend it.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|So far, it is terrific.  I am currently about one-third of the way through Vol. 2 and can't seem to put it down!<br /><br />I have now finished the entire series and am most impressed!  I wish it could continue!
B004XNPQUO|5.0|I like this game! Its not too intense, but its got good feel to it. The graphics are ok, not great. I agree that some more useful apps would be nice rather than kids games, but if you have kids, they like to use you're stuff. And if they are going to use you're stuff, you might as well have something somewhat educational. I guess that's what this game is. Thanks for the freebie Amazon!
B005KELS6Q|5.0|I really like my Kindle's new sleeve. It is exaclty what I wanted. The pouch itself is cute (I have gotten a few compliments)and it serves its purpose. The size is just right and I definitely feel that it is protected. It fell from my desk once and not a scratch :) If you would like to use your Kindle \\"naked\\" this is a great option!
0440539811|1.0|Charging more for the kindle edition than the paper back cost you a sale. You have to pay $200+ for a kindle yet an extra premium for the books. I remember when they used to be cheaper. I won't be buying anymore kindle books.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I love this app, it makes it easy to follow through with a quick 5 ab workout!<br /><br />There's no excuse for not doing something everyday.
B0043GXYBO|5.0|I started reading this series because a friend of mine (who is apparently a vampire lit nut) suggested that I might like them. She told me that it was like Harry Potter with vampires. I find this description to be erroneous in some ways, apt in others. I should point out that I myself am not a big fan of vampire literature because most of it is a mockery of the classic stereotypes and is poorly written smut intended for teenagers or women who lack any sort of excitement in their love lives.<br /><br />With that said, I reluctantly picked up this book... and couldn't stop reading. Even though the writing is really juvenile (it's written with teenagers in mind, what do you expect?) I could overlook that fact and still be engrossed in this book. The characters seemed interesting and were engaging through most of the book. I found the plot simplistic, but enjoyable. The departure from the standard mythos of the vampire also didn't bother me as I found it to be kind of creative.<br /><br />However, I did find the word \\"vampyre\\" (its spelling) to be highly annoying as did the word \\"bullpoopie\\". No teenager I know of talks like that. Not even ones who don't cuss (and I had some friends who were like that).<br /><br />All in all, it was a basic story that sets up events in future books nicely. And it was a fast read. I really wanted to read the second book after I finished this and as I mentioned, I'm not really into vampire literature.<br /><br />So this got a 5 out of 5 from me based on interest, story development and a departure from the standard mythos in a way I could appreciate (instead of wanting to stab my eyes out with a spork like I did when I read some *other* \\"vampire\\" literature).

B002BWP49C|1.0|I am fortunate in the fact that I rented this. I am however, unfortunate in the fact that yet again, I wasted my money. I have slogged through both the books and movies in this series in an attempt to understand the fanbase (many of whom are my friends) and have come away feeling like I have done nothing but waste my time and money. The good news is that because I rented it, it was cheaper for one and I had the option of fastforwarding through vast portions of this yawn fest.<br /><br />First of all, this movie is of course only part 1 of the last book, although I agree with most reviewers in stating that the book really doesn't have enough substance to qualify needing two movies since most of the dialogue in the first portion of the book (before the climax), is internal.<br /><br />About the only good thing I say about this movie is that the backdrops are elaborate and visual eye candy (especially since the rest of the film is boring).<br /><br />The acting is stilted (but I guess I can't expect much when they have crappy books to work with in the first place) and very wooden. This isn't much of a departure from any of the other films.<br /><br />The wedding was obnoxious. The overextended kissing scene was unnecessary. The honeymoon portion (which I know takes up a lot of the first part of the book) was so boring that I ended up fast-forwarding through it (hey, there was no real dialogue, so why do I need to slog through it?).<br /><br />The special effects for the 'wolf pack' are laughable. Are you seriously telling me that with the special effects the movie industry possesses and with the vast amount of money that this stupid series raked up that they couldn't afford DECENT SFX to make the wolves believable? Especially when you consider that the werewolves don't even mimic classical werewolves, but instead look like overgrown wild wolves! I do not think it would have cost much more or been that difficult to make them believable.<br /><br />And oh, the birth scene.. It was graphic in the book, I think less so here, honestly, but still gross. This portion really only serves to scare the crap out of underage girls from ever wanting to have sex. It was like watching a really demented version of \\"The Miracle of Life\\". I personally think it would have been better (in both film and book) had Bella died and the story continued with her daughter and Edward.<br /><br />And do I even need to go into how entirely wrong and/or disturbing it is that the teenage werewolf \\"imprinted\\" on a newborn infant? Pedophilia comes to mind.. also, lack of free will on the part of the imprintee.<br /><br />Also, baby Renesmee (stupid name, BTW) = creepy!<br /><br />There is just so much wrong with these films (and the books) that I can't understand how anyone could give any of them more than 2 stars. And to be honest, I think you could probably find better things to spend your money on.e.. It was graphic in the book, I think less so here, honestly, but still gross.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|More technical books should be like this one. In fact, this should be the model for practice-based books.<br /><br />Based in a decade of first hand experience, Ash clearly knows the problem he's trying to solve. Too many method books seem to be based on shallow experience, as if they are rushed to print to score quickly, at the expense of being tried and tested.<br /><br />The advice is specific, and written well enough for the reader to understand and apply it, but also the subject is sufficiently abstracted to deal with the broadest possible application without overreaching. Too many method books overgeneralize and are therefore inscrutable or achieve uselessness.<br /><br />Maurya specifically speaks to the \\"work in progress\\" nature of the subject, and invites the reader to critique and to add to the body of knowledge. Far too many method books assert that their content is the \\"final word\\" on the subject - surprisingly often in fast evolving domains.<br /><br />This is a great bookend to Eric Ries' Lean Startup book - a very different book, indeed. Together the two create stereoscopic vision on the topic.<br /><br />Having worked with some exceptional sales people who naturally \\"live\\" the advice in this book through training and experience - although they don't use the same words - I can't help but notice that a convenient way to think of this book is \\"business development for the techie.\\"<br /><br />And what can I say, I am partial to models, and Ash Maurya has helped to refine a very important model.

B0010SKSTO|5.0|I really like body language books and this is one of the few I really love. It's detailed and information is broken down properly, making it really easy to read.
0061928356|2.0|This was an interesting story, but I wouldn't say it was well written.  There are two or more stories told in this book.  The story of the impoverished couple in India was interesting and pretty well written.  The characters were pretty well developed.  The descriptions of India were very good, and realistic, including the slums of Mumbai.  I have been to Mumbai, and traveled around India, and it brought back memories for me.<br /><br />The part of the story involving the U.S. family, and their relatives in India, was much weaker.  The writing was particularly sophomoric, as though it had been written for an adult ed, or high school creative writing class.  Most of the characters were so one-dimensional and shallow.  The character Somer was just irksome.  So whiny.  I certainly didn't feel or share the experience of her emotions.  I have experienced infertility and miscarriage, which is horrible.  I married a Stanford grad and lived in the Bay Area.  I thought I would be able to relate.  But her story often read with the depth and soul of a Harlequin Romance.  Here is a description of her miscarriage:<br /><br />\\"The medical journal drops from Somer's hand and she clutches her abdomen.  She rises from the couch and stumbles toward the bathroom, supporting herself down the long corridor of the Victorian flat.\\" ... \\"She sees the bright red blood dripping down the pale skin of her thigh.  \\"No. Oh god, please no.\\" Her plea is soft but urgent.\\" ... \\"It does not.  She puts her face in her hands, and the tears come.\\"<br /><br />Really?  The tears come?  Wow, that clutches at me emotionally ... not!  A bit melodramatic, yes.  Dramatic?  No.<br /><br />The Somer character is just not believable.  OK, she is a very bright, Stanford educated doctor.  Raised in California.  Marries an Indian.  Adopts an Indian baby.  And yet she takes zero interest in embracing anything Indian.  She takes no interest in the culture, the food, the clothing, her relatives.  When she visits Indiashe gets stupidly confused over the most simple cultural differences.  She feels out of sorts with her husbands' family (who are perfectly kind and gracious).  Good grief.  Is she just a dim-wit?  No, she is a bright, Stanford med school graduate.  Wait, what?<br /><br />I would guess the author felt particularly close to the Indian part of the story, but tried to fake it through the U.S. part of the story.  When the adopted daughter from the U.S. visited India, it just became tiresome.  She was just so \\"perfect\\".  Her Indian family was so \\"perfect\\" and accepted this adopted daughter/girl so \\"perfectly\\".  Ugh.  Very shallow.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|I've been using Ash's advice since the publication of the first version of Running Lean.  He brings a unique perspective to the Lean Start-up movement and effectively complements other books like [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses]], [[ASIN:0984999302 The Startup Owner's Manual: The Step-By-Step Guide for Building a Great Company]], and [[ASIN:0470876417 Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers]].  I think all entrepreneurs will benefit from Ash's insights and tools.

B000FC1HBY|4.0|I tend to agree somewhat with the reviewers commenting on the length of the book.  I really liked it but as with the first book in the series, I began to skim large sections dealing with the intricacies of battles and dreams.  Those passages are vividly described but with multiple battles and multiple dream segments, it becomes difficult sorting out who died in the narrative and who died in the dreams.  Nonetheless it's still a great book and I'm ready for HBO's next season (can't WAIT to see how they stage the scenes with the Dothraki!).
B001HNE3NO|4.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. Couldn't put it down! Learned a lot about World War II and France that I was unaware of. A must have and I've been recommending it to all of my friends.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I purchased my SB-900 about three and a half years ago.  It has performed flawlessly for me during that time.  I am not a professional, just someone who needs to take flash pictures across a room or with bounce or other conditions that demand a powerful flash with a fast recycle time.  The SB-900's zoom feature also helped to provide longer flash range under dim-lighting situations.<br /><br />At the time I purchased the SB-900, I also purchased a set of 4 Sanyo 2700 mAh NiMH batteries and a LaCross BC-900 charger that came with 4 LaCross 2600 mAh NiMH batteries.  The batteries were always recharged using a slow and full discharge (100 mA) then a slow charge (200 mA).  This operation was performed at least every three months, even if the batteries had not been used (which was frequently the case).  The batteries gave me flawless performance for about 3 years now.<br /><br />Recently, I went to use these batteries and all I got was the low-battery display on the SB-900.  I tried the other set of batteries and got the same response.  Switching to Alkaline batteries solved the immediate problem and the flash was usable.  I found it strange that both sets of batteries should fail on me at the same time.  They had both been cycled through the discharge/charge) cycle a few days before the attempted use.<br /><br />When I returned home, I checked the voltage on all batteries and they all provided at least 1.2 volts when measured in parallel with a flashlight bulb load across the battery terminals.  The batteries would operate a flashlight with no problem, and the subsequent discharge/charge cycle in the BC-900 gave normal readings, and yet the batteries still failed to operate the SB-900.<br /><br />I contacted Nikon who instructed me to mail the unit to them for evaluation.  Before doing that, I purchased a set of Sanyo eneloop 2000 mAh batteries and tried them (straight out of the package).  The SB-900 worked perfectly, firing repeated full-power flashes with good recycle times.<br /><br />My conclusion is that the SB-900 battery sensor probably looks not only at the voltage of its batteries, but also at the available current output under heavy load.  If the batteries cannot provide a high enough current for reasonable recycle times, then the low battery warning is given. The instantaneous current draw of the SB-900 is much, much higher than that of a flashlight or other device.<br /><br />The main reason that I purchased the Sanyo eneloop batteries is their advertised (and user-confirmed) long shelf life, and resistance to memory effects and like degradation.  It is my hope that they will give me many years of performance without the shelf-life issues of regular NiMH batteries.

B001IYCMNA|1.0|This product may work at home, but never use this in business environment otherwise you may get a lot of trouble!    Our company bought one WAP4410N two weeks ago, then it kept disconnected every 2 hours.  As the only IT guy in the company, I kept unplug and replug in the power once it hangs.  Then after discussing the annoying issue to the retailer, they agreed to exchange another one.  So we get a new one, but the issues remain!    See these threads from the CISCO forum:  [...]    When you buy a product such as this, you cannot enjoy the power it provides, but need to set a lot of limitations to make it work.  So annoying!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The 3rd book breaks from the mould of the others in it's scope and subject, moving away from the games themselves and taking on a more political and expansive scope. Some of the ideas that come in had the potential to be riveting and a more cerebral finish to this series however the change of subject feels forced frequently a little clunky at others, while there are sections of greatness I get the feeling of a slightly confused and inconsistent end to the series
B0011UGLK6|4.0|I read this book on the plane easily because its a series of short stories that kept me interested throughout my flight!  A friend recommended it to me.

1849514003|4.0|Full review at:  [...]  Cocos2d for iPhone 1 Game Development Cookbook Review  iDevGames.com / Alex Sikora -- Mar 02, 2012    Overview  -----------    I have yet another Cocos2d book to review! Probably one of the (if not the most) popular 2d game engines for iOS development. Cocos2d is a free engine anyone can use to make 2d games. This book was not designed for those new to development, or those new to development on the iPhone. It assumes a bit of experience with Objective-C and Cocoa, and some minor familiarity with the Xcode IDE. It is a cookbook style (as the title states) introduction to using Cocos2d in your future iOS games. You can download the source code found in the book on the publisher's website.    The Good  -----------    Coverage  This book covers everything you need to know to use Cocos2d in your games. It starts off right away with drawing sprites to the screen, perhaps the most important of recipes in the book. It also covers how to take user input in a variety of fashions, from on-screen d-pads and \\"analog\\" sticks, to accelerometer controls.    Good Recipes  The recipes in this book are well written and structured, easy to understand. The recipes follow a simple format of explaining what they are going to do, usually with some screenshot to illustrate their point. This is followed by the source code to implement it. The code is commented and step-by-step descriptions follow the code describing what new methods and classes do. Methods and their parameters are clearly explained, as well as value ranges and typical choices.    Extra Content  These recipes also extend past just Cocos2d features. The chapters \\"Physics\\" and \\"AI and Logic\\" cover topics that are useful to any game developer. The Box2D physics system is explained with useful techniques, A* pathfinding is explained, and even Lua scripting. These extra tidbits are very useful for any developers looking to make better games.    The Bad  -----------    Ugly Code  Strange for a development book to mess this one up as it's probably the most important part of the book, but the code formatting is just a bit ugly. I'm not sure what font they chose but it seems like it got stretched a bit. Also some code lines wrap on to a new line with no special formatting at all. Perhaps it was simply the review ebook version I received, and I assume they will fix it in a future version.    Depth  This is a cookbook style development guide, so it can't cover everything, but there are occasions where you want to know more information that you will have to figure out yourself. This can be a good thing though! The best way to learn is through your own experimentation.
B001BZRUR4|3.0|Zusak wrote The Book Thief which is a very well-told tale of suffering and resilience, so I was excited to find I Am The Messenger which won an award  in the field of children's literature. I read the Messenger and found it to be a good read, but I don't think it should be labeled \\"children's literature.\\" MAYBE ADOLESCENT literature would be a better description. I'm an old lady, though, so take my words with a grain of salt. Read for yourself and see what you think.

B0015YFOH4|4.0|This is one of my all time favourite albums and I own it in many different formats.<br />Having been a vinyl junkie all my life, I was only recently converted to SA-CD and I am now trying to get as many titles as I can in this format. I was overjoyed to see this album and in fact all the Dead can Dance albums were available.<br /><br />Firstly, the sound quality is everything you would expect from SA-CD; it rivals the vinyl recording. However, the re-mix/re-master is not that good. It seems to be the same remaster that was used for the 180g vinyl release and it just doesn't sound as good as the original recording. From Xavier onwards the voices are just too low in the mix and sound slightly muffled.  This continues to the Lisa Gerrard vocals on what is side 2 on the vinyl LP. The virgin vinyl release suffers in this way too.<br /><br />So I've given this 4 stars because it is a great album and the SA-CD is substantially better than the CD release but the re-master could have been better.
B0000457HB|4.0|Love this cd set.  but there is one song on my cd that skips.  I thought it was my cd  player.  But, I tried it on several different cd players and got the same thing.  I don't know which song it is, but  it kind of ruins  the whole cd.
B005723JSQ|1.0|The Kindle version of this book has endnotes, which are at the end of the chapter.  I couldn't figure out how to access them without skipping to the next chapter and then going back a page.  Neither could the Amazon rep I talked to, so I guess there's not an easy way to do so.  While getting to the endnote isn't so bad, going back to the reference in the text was a challenge because I didn't know how many pages I skipped ahead to read the endnotes.<br /><br />I admit that I am a new Kindle owner, but this really took the pleasure out of reading this particular novel.  The endnotes are part of the experience, but I returned the Kindle version and will order the hardcopy.

B003Y5H5F6|3.0|In \\"Underworld: Awakening,\\" Kate Beckinsale is back as Selene, the \\"Death Dealer\\" in tight, black costume. While the fourth entry of the \\"underworld\\" franchise is enjoyable enough with decent, if not outstanding, action set-pieces, the film suffers from its underdeveloped storyline. Action scenes are fun to watch (and there are many of them), but the film's pace seems more like rushed than fast-paced, not allowing us to connect to anyone in the film, until the final thirty minutes, in which the story finally decides on where to go.<br /><br />\\"Underworld: Awakening\\" opens with a quick recap of the previous films, followed by an action sequence showing what has happened to Selene and Michael since the last chapter. Now humans know the existence of Vampires and Lycans, and Selene and Michael are captured and imprisoned in a laboratory of a certain institute. Twelve years later, Selene wakes up again and runs away with a young vampire David (Theo James) and a little girl Eve or \\"Subject 2\\" (India Eisley), but they are relentlessly hunted by the werewolves.<br /><br />Only Kate Beckinsale returns to the series. Her portrayal of Selene is as impressive as ever, but other actors are underused, especially two veterans Stephen Rea playing Dr. Jacob Lane, and Charles Dance as the elder of the surviving vampire clan.<br /><br />As Len Wiseman, director of the first two \\"Underworld\\" films, had been attached to another project \\"Total Recall,\\" Swedish director team Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein was called in. I was not much impressed with their last effort \\"Shelter,\\" a thriller starring Julianne Moore, but at least they got action scenes right in \\"Underworld: Awakening.\\" I wish that whoever helms the next installment will come up with a better story to tell.
B006M6NV0M|5.0|Well, I rented the direct video, because a. I have no blue-ray player.b. I have been burned on so many director's cuts and unrated versions of movies. So the big question is it worth seeing the director's cut? YES!!! It's more of a complete version of the movie. Hopefully they'll release this on normal dvd and then I can buy it. Also makes me want to see the sequel.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|This is the same review that I wrote for the other Twilight movies because I feel the same about all of them. So......<br />Like all of the movies they are not strictly by the book which bothered me some. But I knew before hand that the<br />movies hardly ever stay true to the books.  Some are better than others and these movies are not bad.  I enjoyed<br />the books better but as movies go these were pretty good.  Don't compare the books to the movies and just sit back<br />and enjoy the slightly altered storyline.  They are still good and I enjoyed them.  Will watch them again all at one time in a movie marathon with my grandkids and daughter when I go to visit them the next time.  And yes I am<br />not a tween, teen, young adult or even middle aged,  I am a grandmother who thinks that the writers out there for<br />our young people are for the most part doing a wonderful job.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|Terminator 2 was by far the best in the series (IMO). Having the Skynet edition with so many extra features makes it an even better value. It's nice to watch it in high definition too. I grabbed this on sale for $7 and I am very happy with the purchase. 5star.

B0052U59F4|4.0|So last night I'm at dinner with a bunch of girlfriends. Someone asks me what I'm reading, and the answer should be \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\". Instead, I say, \\"Nothing I'm willing to 'fess up to.\\" I came home to find Jay Leno talking about Fifty Shades of Grey on the Tonight Show! This morning, there's a segment on the Today Show! Oh, my! I guess this isn't my own dirty little secret any more!<br /><br />I inhaled Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker in two days. Fifty Shades Freed is finally starting to drag a bit. I'm finding myself saying, ok, enough of the hot sex, tell me more about the yacht and the jet and the helicopter ... perhaps I should have paced myself instead of pigging out on all of it at once.<br /><br />UPDATE: Why does everyone insist on it being literature? It's smut for women, not literature and not relationship advice. Yes, there's too much repetition. Yes, the story is unbelievable. Of course you wouldn't truly want to live out a relationship like that ... but it's a hot hot fantasy and it got my libido going, and that's good for any relationship. I much prefer this to stereotypical male-oriented smut. Degrading to women? Maybe, if you're twelve and you're looking at this as a relationship role model. But, sweetie, if you're twelve, you SHOULDN'T BE READING THIS BOOK!!! (For that matter, you shouldn't read Twilight as a relationship model, either!)<br /><br />Lastly, I seem to be in the minority on this, but I thought the inner goddess was adorable.
B005GYGCOI|1.0|One of the reasons I bought a Kindle was because I take a three week trip every year and have grown tired of lugging around 10 lbs. of books.  I like to take long distance trains, and I like to read on the train.<br /><br />Theoretically the Kindle should be ideal for travel guides.  Light, searchable, what could go wrong?  Apparently, quite a lot.<br /><br />In sum, here are the problems with the Kindle version of this travel guide:<br /><br />1. Maps are unreadable.  Either they are condensed onto one page (with miniscule type that is unreadable with a magnifying glass.  I actually took a magnifying glass and tried to read it.  I couldn't) or split haphazardly where one map is on several pages.<br /><br />2. Lists are unreadable.  Apparently, no one paid attention to formatting the page margins of, say, the list of trains that leave Delhi.  The name of the train is listed, as is the fare, but then it cuts off, literally in mid-word.  It costs 200 rupees to go to Udai...>  Where exactly?  I think it means Udaipur, but I can't be sure.  Also, I have no idea how long it takes to get to Udai....  This is true for every single such list in the book.<br /><br />3. The table of contents doesn't really work. Links are nonintuitive and don't really work.  In some sections links work differently than the analagous links in other sections.<br /><br />4. In fact, searching the book is pretty much useless.  If you enter Pushkar, it gives you a list of every time the word \\"Pushkar\\" appears in the book.  Introduction, side notes, glossary, it doesn't care.  It also gives you a tiny snippet of text, but not enough to identify if clicking on that will take you to the section on Pushkar, where you can find a hotel, or the index, or some inane note in the beginning in a section about agricultural fairs in India where Pushkar gets mentioned.<br /><br />All in all, the job of taking this from the print to the Kindle format seems to have been done haphazardly, by separate teams of IT people that apparently never talked to each other, nor compared notes.  Additionally, and this I find really unbelievable, apparently no one at LP actually proofread this book.  The map and list problems aren't minor.  They jump out at you about five minutes after you start reading the book, and they persist.<br /><br />So, after dropping twenty bucks or so on this thing, I actually had to go and spend more money to pick up the print copy.  So I paid for the book, twice.<br /><br />As far as content goes, it's pretty decent.  LP standard, which is better than most.  But as far as buying the Kindle edition goes, I cannot recommend against it strongly enough.eople that apparently never talked to each other, nor compared notes.

006197806X|5.0|[[ASIN:0061726834 Delirium]] was one of my favorite reads of 2011, and I was thrilled to get my hands on Pandemonium! This installment to the series shocked me (in a good way). It's so different from Delirium in both tone and setting, and nothing like what I was expecting. The story is told from Lena's perspective, but the chapters alternate between \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\".  It took a few chapters for me to adjust to the flow, but for Lena's story, I think this format is brilliant.<br /><br />In Pandemonium, Lena is grieving and angry... she's no longer the innocent, somewhat naïve girl we came to know in Delirium. She's defiant and courageous - a fighter. By alternating between her present and past, the reader is able to see, and understand why Lena has so drastically changed.<br /><br />Pandemonium is much darker, and more intense than Delirium. In comparison, Delirium seems light and romantic! This installment has new characters, and a fantastic plot that grips you and doesn't let go. Lauren Oliver's writing is vivid and beautiful... making you feel each of Lena's emotions.<br /><br />This is a must read for fans of Delirium! It will shock you, but you will love it. Pandemonium's ending left me with my jaw hanging open and dying for Requim (book 3)! I love this series; if you haven't read Delirium yet, get to it, pronto.<br /><br />Originally posted on A Book and a Latte - bookandlatte (dot) com.

B0006DKA2Y|5.0|A friend sent me this book and I opened it standing in the kitchen.  Opened it up and couldn't put it down.  Not sure when I finally went to the living room to sit down but it captured my heart, my mind and I loved traveling with her through her walk about.  Later I heard her speak about her adventures and experienced the journey from her body as she shared the mind bending events.  I've sold lots of copies and recommended it to oh so many.  It is such a difference to watch an author who has written fiction, act as if it was real compared to one who has had the experience.  Also they don't have to read notes to \\"remember what they said\\" in the book.[[ASIN:0060723513 Mutant Message Down Under, Tenth Anniversary Edition]]
B0063GORYU|5.0|What is not to like? Does what is supposed to and you can make it as easy or as challenging as you want. Nice, quiet, relaxing game that requires some thinking skills. Have this on my phone &amp; kindle fire. Pretty hooked.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Easy to use. Quick and clever AI. Good for all skill levels. Would certainly recommend to other Kindle fire users.
0756405890|5.0|Hemingway said, \\"All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you: the good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse and sorrow, the people and the places and how the weather was. If you can get so that you can give that to people, then you are a writer.\\"<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss is a writer.<br /><br />I have never been so immersed in a book; never felt so connected to a character; never felt such aching remorse over finishing a book - as I did with Name of the Wind....except, of course, when reading its sequel.<br /><br />Mr. Rothfuss is a storyteller, the like of which is rare and amazing.  If there exists any real magic in the world, then surely such storytelling is part of it.<br /><br />I know I haven't given you much information about the book itself, so here goes:<br />The story is rich in detail, depth, and scope.  The characters are finely drawn and evolve in realistic and deeply touching ways.  If you enjoy immersion, then this is a book to drown yourself in.  If you enjoy compelling characters, then this book will introduce you to new friends and enemies.  And, if you just like the ride, well, it isn't a fast one, but this book will carry you far and wide.<br /><br />I suppose it is obvious by now that I adore \\"The Name of the Wind\\".  The second book is even better.  I hope I've convinced you to read this book....and, when you're finished, no thanks required....I just want three things from you....

The \\"oral stories\\" that were documented weave together an interesting and multifaceted account of a world wide zombie outbreak.  \\"World War Z\\" gives us the chance to learn from the past without really having to have lived it.  We'll all be safer in the a zombie outbreak because of this amazing read.
0792846443|5.0|Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a famous author, especially noted for his series of books about a character named Misery Chastain. Paul wants to spread his wings and begin to develop other new storylines and writing styles. His new book Misery's child is just being published and he has already written a new novel not yet published that is based on this change in his writing. While driving through Colorado he has a terrible single car accident when in a raging blizzard. He is severely injured but luckily, or unluckily, he is found and saved by his #1 fan.<br /><br />Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) rescues him and puts him up into her home and is nursing him back to health. What follows is a movie based on a story written by Stephen King that will make your hair stand up. Annie is mentally ill and her infatuation with Paul and the character Misery makes her act out in violent and irrational ways. This movie was portrayed expertly by both James Caan and Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates performance will simply horrify you. I do not want to ever be in a room with that woman alone, she scares me! Ever since this movie was released I think of this character whenever I see her.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and you will simply enjoy it. It is violent and shocking, as are many things based on Stephen King novels, but the storyline and acting is superb.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to you!
0807014273|4.0|I found that Man's Search for Meaning was a refreshing read in its ability to portray the unceasing question of the reason for our existence in an explicit manor. His approach to the human mind can be seen in the diction of his prose. Frankl does not intimidate his reader with convoluted explanations of the perplexing labyrinth that is our mind, but rather he speaks directly and clearly about the nature of experiencing everyday. Nor does he make his audience suffer by going into great gore and detail, but rather he makes his audience suffer in blatantly stating the facts of humanity. Like many of us, Victor Frankl  does not have an answer to the \\"big questions\\" , but resolves that mans power over other beings is our ability to continue to question what we don't know-even if we never find the answer. The mirroring effect that the dual story-one of a Holocaust survivor, the other of a Psychotherapist-gives is theory the advantage of applicability. It is fascinating to see what experiences mold the mind of a man who studies the mind. To anyone interested in the nature of nature I greatly recommend this read.

B004QL7K70|1.0|It's Thomas' (Thomas Mann) 18th birthday and his friend Costa (Oliver Cooper) has plans to throw him the biggest party ever. With his parents going out of town for their anniversary, Thomas has the house to himself. Thomas just wants a small get-together or \\"enough to be cool\\" as he puts it. However Costa wants this to be a party everyone remembers, one that everyone will be talking about long after it's over, and one that will change the lives of Thomas, Costa, and their friend JB (Jonathan Daniel Brown) forever. Not to mention the three of them finally getting laid. Chronicling the entire spectacle with his camera is a weird kid from school named Dax (Dax Flame). With his sights set on nothing but a sea of women and the most epic night he and his friends could possibly ever have, Project X is what Costa labels this little filming event.<br /><br />A documentary-style party movie isn't exactly something that anyone should be excited about. A found-footage The Hangover is all this feels like going into it and Todd Phillips producing doesn't really help change that opinion. The end result is mostly exactly what trailers let on with a conclusion that is extremely predictable with few surprises in between.<br /><br />Stupid high school humor and crude and raunchy jokes are what bridge the gap between first being introduced the characters and the party actually happening. Its immaturity practically becomes overbearing as the comedy will mostly just make people outside the high school demographic feel older than they really are. The biggest surprise comes in the form of a drug dealer named T-Rick (Rick Shapiro). This is where the mascot for the movie comes in and T-Rick's pursuit of retrieving that mascot is perhaps the only original aspect of the movie. The line about him being like The Terminator is the funniest line to come out of Project X. Nick Nervies and Alexis Knapp play Tyler and Everett who are hired as security for the party. Tyler has this big bouncer like attitude and is this teeny tiny little kid while Everett takes his job a little too seriously. These two, T-Rick, along with the quick montage of Milo the dog being in a bouncy castle and getting into crazy antics during the party are the closest things to highlights the movie has to offer.<br /><br />With that said, nearly everything else plays out exactly as you expect it to. Losers try to throw a party to change their reputation, that party finally taking place and being even bigger than they imagined, and eventually said party getting out of control. There are so many instances in the movie where an entire song will play while we're shown various shots of this crazy party and Thomas and his friends enjoying themselves. If anything ever felt like an extended music video before it was outdone by Project X. There's barely a story here. Filming an out of control party doesn't make it a movie. Calling it a movie feels disrespectful to anything that came before it.<br /><br />There is one small shred of depth Project X offers and it lies within that one party changing everything mindset. It's as if it offers this sense of accomplishment while doing something nobody thought you were capable of. Changing your life with the events that transpire in one night is something that probably seems strangely liberating, but this could also be viewed as the movie encouraging this type of behavior which is just as idiotic as the premise of the movie itself.<br /><br />Project X feels like the combination of Superbad and The Hangover shot in the same style you saw in Chronicle, but doesn't come anywhere close to being as good or even as decent as any of those movies. Many people claimed to be surprised by Project X afterwards and that it was more or better than they thought it would be. The studio rep told me he found the movie somewhat inspiring. Unfortunately Project X inspired me to do nothing more than see something that's actually worthwhile.titude and is this teeny tiny little kid while Everett takes his job a little too seriously.

B0052U59F4|2.0|This is a horrid story to even been written and the reader should be clued in before purchasing it. The secret sex room and fetishs this man has are insane.I know people are weird but if a guy has no steady girlfriend and is handsome and wealthy that should be a triple red flag. Stay away! Not a good read. Unfathamable!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I downloaded the game as the free daily special from Amazon and was expecting a mediocore game(let's face it, you usually get what you..uh..don't pay for). So when i started this bad boy up, the visuals, sound effects, music, and writing blew my expectations. It's a very nice game with different difficulty settings and a nice witty story. I enjoyed it and I still do. I'm off to go find more games from Hexage now. I'll gladly pay for anything new.
B000KGGLCU|2.0|What an amazing concert! but when you watch the DVD is sooooo annoying. About 3 seconds per shot, specially in the beginning. For a while is OK but then it becames just hard to watch. The editing totally ruined it for me.
B007E6YYLO|2.0|Its all been said already , agree totally with LP 'illip's review, he says it all, should not have got rid of orig dir , first season was amazing, so well done, second season is a durge, characters have become so annoying, the love triangle WHO CARES, kill em all, studio are ruining the show, turn it back to what it was before its too late, it was perfect, I don't get it, ...... idiots

B000NDI3SK|5.0|This absolutely is one of the best of its kind. Images, intelligent dialogue. It explore all sorts of history, evolution, in the most haunting and compelling way. I have no or not enough words to do this justice. Is getting \\"old\\" now and some information, facts, might be dated or no longer true, but there is so much good about this series, even in a 1000 years it would be worth a view or 2 or 3. Get it and watch it. Should be viewed in all colleges and rerun on PBS. Highly recommend.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|If you are over age 13-this film was not designed for you. Very unfair to all the cast and crew who worked to make this family/children's film. It does NOT deserve such poor ratings. Sequels are rarely an improvement on the original but rather an extension. My kids loved it and I liked it as well. Not an Oscar winner yet I would buy it to keep the kids entertained. It was done well with good music and quirky new characters to keep it fresh. Now, Xanadu, that deserved a 1 star rating. See it for yourself and then decide. The kids like it!!!

0199571120|4.0|I would reccomend this dictionary to anyone who finds themselves reading literature in translation from other cultures. American dictionaries may be great in their own respect, but I have the feeling that this dictionary takes into account a more worldly set of meanings/connotations. Because it was published in 2010, it takes into account many of the newest terms derived from advances in technology, particularly in the realm of social networking. For example, one of the entries for 'friend' reads: \\"a contact on a social networking site.\\" Furthermore, the word as a verbal definition: \\"add (someone) to a list of friends or contacts on a social networking website.\\" For newer definitions like these, Oxford has laid \\"Word Trend\\" boxes into the text in order to explain what may be unfamiliar to some.<br /><br />The only drawbacks: 1) The sleeve around the book could have been stronger, or, even better, scrapped in turn for some nice 'foily' lettering engraved on the front cover. 2) I may be splitting hairs, and there isn't any apparent damage, but I expected a heavier cover/spine/binding overall. I wouldn't call it inadequate by any means, however I am sure that there are editions of this (or at least similar) dictionary that have something more suited to heavy use over time.
0545265355|5.0|The books arrived, wrapped in plastic, completely new. I almost never read for fun, and I'd have to say I truly enjoyed the series. I recommend it to all age groups and both genders. There's the action, suspense, and romance. Personally, I'd have to say the first book was the best. You've GOTTA read this!
B001DLWF8U|4.0|Interesting little film with multiple aspects to it. Not ordinary Hollywood by a long shot and presents some interesting things to contemplate. Not sure worth 3 or even 2 views but certainly 1. Not a \\"date\\" movie. For males. Computer literate males. More than computers.
B004XNPQUO|3.0|I agree with one of the fellow reviewers...why must the FAotD always be some kind of kid's game? Kids do not buy smartphones...us adults do.

B006WPSQVC|5.0|A lot of the other reviewers were right in saying the acting is not up to par, but the idea behind the film is fantastic.  We need our society moving in this direction.  This movie does have some funny parts.  Good watch!
B00475BUVM|3.0|I bought it for the 3D effects but I was very disappointed by the 3D effects, if any.  I would think that with the use of the CGI in this movie, the 3D effects would be great.  It seems that the only 3D effect is during the conversations where each character would walk by one another.  None of the action scenes seem to have any 3D effect.  The movie itself was good but the 3D effect was nonexistent.

B006PKV2QU|5.0|Very entertaining. my 5 year old really enjoyed it. The illustrations were crisp and well thought. I would recommend this book for children 3-6.
B004XQO90O|5.0|There are very few movies that can grab you and carry you along, right from the beginning, and neither lose that edge or become overly melodramatic. This movie really did it. I'm not going to tell you the plot, as that's not the point of a review like this. But go see it, it's a wonderful movie. I saw it on the DVD which was excellent as well.
B004SEUJYG|5.0|Best picture and actor 1970. Looks great in HD. You can wait forever for a remaster or just buy it now.<br /><br />Update..there is a newly remastered version now available and it is worth getting.
B004XNPQUO|5.0|Could care less about the game just like reading superman's comments..I think there should be an app of just his of the wall insane comments and maybe it could be the faotd
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I've been waiting for updates for ICS (Xoom) and am glad the developer has had recent updates, however the updates have been a waste of bandwidth since the game STILL freezes after a couple minutes of play.<br /><br />Please, please fix!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its very addictive I love it I cant stop playing it. this app.is awesome I rate it with a.five and the harder it starts to get the better
0385534639|3.0|but not a lot of substance. I enjoyed the ride and felt more attached to the main characters than I thought I would, but there was an oddly placed description piece toward the end that really took me out of it. But if you're all about imagery, you will love this book!
B0000AC8N4|4.0|First of all, any session with a Dexter so hot, upfront and well recorded has got to be a winner... I have to say -- and this may get me a few \\"not helpful\\" votes... I'm not blown away by the combination of Michelot and Bud Powell on that session (even though the liner notes point out that Clarke, Powell and Michelot had regularly together extensively prior to the session.) -- Kenny Clarke is undoubtedly smoking.  Powell's solos are definitely Powell (and I love him as one of the most imaginative pianists ever), but the energy level between Clarke and Powell are so discrepant, it almost hurts if you pay attention. (Powell may not have been in the best of condition at the time of the session -- he was, for example, unwilling to learn all the new material that Gordon had planned for the session -- Considering other examples of Gordon's style of composition and arranging, its hard to believe the material would have been THAT difficult to pick up in a few rundowns.  On the other hand, while Powell was a master of the horn like line solo, his harmonic concept may not have been as out there as Dexter -- who's music may have seemed simplistic at times, but deceptively so.<br /><br /> --Fortunately, Dexter's blowing his butt off so hard, it barely matters. --The session is particularly fun to listen to not only because of Dexter's choice of notes, but his variety of tone as well... aside from his big tone, he could play raw and raunchy, hot and swinging, sweet and mellow... bop -- and obviously was an important bridge between swing and more modern styles.<br /><br />All in all, I like the whole album.... but have to say, NIGHT IN TUNISIA is a pretty fun arrangement -- in a funny moment, Dexter flubs the C section, but goes with it, and you can almost hear the musicians smiling and laughing... Dexter's solo is amazing as he's throwing ideas left and throwing that seem almost you're traveling in a time capsule through the various generations he came up playing in and well into the future. -- Kenny Clarke also takes a hot solo which definitely gets the room rumbling.  -- Its great to hear him recorded so sweetly... on a lot of the old bebop sessions, the technology was not sufficient enough to really catch the full depth of his playing... If you weren't a fan of Kenny Clarke before hearing this album, you'll definitely be after.<br /><br />All in all, if you're a Dex fan, this is definitely one session worth having.o the future. -- Kenny Clarke also takes a hot solo which definitely gets the room rumbling.  -- Its great to hear him recorded so sweetly... on a lot of the old bebop sessions, the technology was not sufficient enough to really catch the full depth of his playing...

0596009208|5.0|So, here's the truth about learning programming: never, in your wildest dreams, will you find ONE book that tells you everything a beginner needs to know about programming. I couldn't image how BIG that book would be.  Programming is not the easiest thing to learn by any means, but worth learning if you really want to create something people can use via a computer or other similiar devices. To really learn programming you will need a lot of time for studying and practicing your coding and several different books and videos. Everyone learns differently, so you will need to find the first couple of books that work for you.  Once you have learned from those, you will go on to other books and learn from them.  And I recommend finding video's as well.<br /><br />On to the review for this book.  I LOVE IT!! I find it enjoyable and fun. This is the second book on Java I have gone totally through and have learned a lot of really basic concepts that are enabling me to go on to yet another book that covers the topics in a more advanced way (I'm basically new to programming). For this book, I tend to skip most of the puzzles, but it explains some details of the basic concepts (I.E. that objects live on the heap) that the first book I read missed.<br /><br />Here are some of the topics this book either got me started in understanding or gave me a better basic understand:<br />Polymorphism<br />The basic purpose of the main method<br />Objects<br />Inheritance<br />Creating a GUI Interface<br />And more...<br /><br />Again, this will not be the only book on Java you will read (nor will any other book).  As long as you approach learning programming knowing that you will need several books to get a solid foundation, you should enjoy what this book has to offer.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|love playing. hidden game wish it was a little bigger to see.I would buy more it very relating and fun
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy playing mahjong games and this one puts a fun spin on it...easy to play...and simple to follow...with relaxing music...glad I decided to try it
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game, great graphics,my whole family loves it.<br /> this entertains my grandson for hours on end.<br />It has skill levels for all ages, to play.just a fun game!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I had it on ipod 4 but that is a year old so I git it on my new kindle.<br /><br />and guys this is free version...
B0073CNGCC|5.0|loved every version cant wait till next year. i really wish there were more shows like this that everyone can watch.
0385342063|5.0|It has been a while since a book held my attention throughout the entire read. This one did. It had me giggling at times and holding my breath others. The ending had me on  the edge of my seat in awe. A great read! Worth the high price in my opinion.
0545425115|4.0|After listening to my 14 year old talk about this series as she devoured all three books, I decided to give them a try. The first book in the series I found to be very enthralling and entertaining. The story is brutal, with the heroine having to fight in a game for the country's capital, the game is between her and other people from other parts of the country and all of the fighters are kids. It's a pretty complex tale with each part of the country being called districts and each serve a purpose. Out of all the districts, two from each are picked to fight. Katniss, the heroine is smart and strong. She decides to fight in the games called the Hunger Games in place of her little sister. The rest is just page turning action.<br /><br />My daughter has loaned her books out to whomever she could to get people to read them. It's really exciting to have kids so excited about reading books. I love it. This is a taunt, action packed series. I am about half way through the second book, and I really like the atmosphere and the story line, as well as the characters in the books. Very enjoyable if you are looking for something different to read. The movie will be out soon and we are really looking forward to seeing it. The fast pace of the books will ensure that I will have them all read before the film comes out toward the end of March.<br /><br />The writing is very straight forward but has a quality to it that pulls the reader into the story and at times situations are funny, sad and often very dangerous with the reader going along for a intense ride. My Mom who is in her late seventies, really liked the first book very much but is finding the subsequent books a little too violent and brutal for her tastes but hasn't finished that last book just yet, but she is still finishing the series to see what happens to the heroine and her friends and family. Very readable and unique series.
B007BRJYF2|1.0|just wasted money buying for kindle fire as assumed it would run on it since i was on the Amazon site---wish it would have been stated it would not work on the fire
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a fun game to be shared by all ages.  I think the whole family could share in the fun.
B006DHAT5K|3.0|I laughed more than a few times. If you have to watch a chick flick, this is probably one of the better ones I have seen. /the story is kind of silly, but some of her ex boyfriends and the situations she gets into with them are a riot. The female co-stars were also a good mix of laughs.
159562015X|5.0|The book arrived right on time and was in very good condition. I would order from this site again. It had the link inside that I needed and was very easy to organize and use. It's a great book.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I never read Jodi Picoult before. After reading this book that will change. I have never been brought to a full on weep from a book. Not an easy read but definitly worth the tears. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Ooh such joy !  This may be the best concert DVD I've ever purchased!  In fact, it may be better than actually being there (unless you had 5th Row Center seats).<br />To all Cohen lovers...This is a MUST !
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Very well done and polished game. Would get 5 save for the ads. Great gameplay and good controls and a few more words to make twenty.
B0051HNMTI|1.0|Looks like it would be a very useful app but the video wont play. Sound works and the timer works but video wont play. Don't know what they are doing for some exercises. Frustrating!
B004EBUXSA|5.0|This processor flies! I can literally have Photoshop, pro tools and battlefield 3 running all at once, and the system is fine (w/ 16gb corsair vengeance kit). If you plan on overclocking (hopefully you do) be sure to install a custom fan (maybe one by coolermaster) I highly highly recommend this processor if your doing anything serious on your rig!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like the audio bibles: that I can choose a version & chapter then walk around feeding my spirit by hearing the Word.<br /> The wide selection of various bibles really help with studying.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I got this game on my Kindle Fire as a way to entertain my 6-year old granddaughter, when we are in the car, at restaurants, waiting at the doctor's, etc. and boy did I stumble onto a great game!  She loves it, and it is challenging for me.  The good thing about it is that you download the game, so it can be played even when there's no internet connection.  There are multiple levels, and you can play the same levels over and over, to try and improve your score.  The trick is to feed the frog candy by a series of swinging ropes, air gusts, bubbles and more, with hazards like spiders who will eat the candy, sharp points and other things.  Let's just say that my 6-year old granddaughter is a much better player than me!!  Her 10-year old brother who has his own Kindle liked it so much he bought the game too.
B005F96UNM|3.0|Started out rather disappointing, as it was beginning to look like a musical and rather hokey, but I stuck with it and the story developed and the singing and dancing around stopped, so I could take it a little more seriously.<br /><br />The visuals were stunning, and the fight scenes were very great. I think you have to be in a mood for this type of movie, though.<br /><br />I would say it has the feel of sin city if I were to compare it to anything else... but more cartoonish, and silly.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I have to say that I found the first half of this book highly entertaining. We have two college kids who are from different sides of the tracks who become attracted to one another. Travis Maddox is a real bad boy. He participates in illegal fights in the bowels of the numerous college buildings on campus. He is a badass, lady killer and no one messes with him. His tattoo-covered muscles keep the guys at bay but his rugged good looks has afforded him quite a posse of sorority groupies.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is a quiet, girl from Wichita, Kansas. Need I say more? Travis is not her type at all and she has no interest in dating him. The more she says no to him, the more he chases her. Finally the two make a bet. If Abby wins, Travis has to stay celibate for a month. If Abby wins she has to spend a month in his apartment.<br /><br />The dance of romance between these two is very engaging. I laughed out loud at Abby's snappy one-liners, constantly putting Travis in his place. As their romance grew and Abby refused to see the obvious, I grew impatient with her. As their romance progressed and he became controlling, it was obvious that this dysfunctional relationship would go nowhere. This becomes a classic case of love being unable to conquer all. But the fairy tale ending really bugs me because young girls are reading this and thinking they can save their abusive guys if they just love them enough to stick it out.<br /><br />Travis has some serious issues and needs counseling. He is downright scary. Do I want them to work out? Of course, I do. But love alone is not enough to save Travis from himself, and giving the reader that impression is dangerous.
B004XNPQUO|3.0|I downloaded this app because it sounded fun, and it is.  I'm having a blast and its just the right challenge level.  I'm worried about the &quot;sticky intent&quot; stuff.  I'm not quite sure what this is, as I've never encountered it before, and all explanations I found online used terminology I'm unfamiliar with.  What I did get out of it is that &quot;sticky intents&quot; are not recommended and many discourage their use.  With this in mind, I'm uninstalling this app at the first sign of slowing, security breaches, or ads
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good game, especially for free! Download now and waste your day away, over and over and over and over again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good book.  Also the other books in the series I would recommend as well.
B005K17RU0|4.0|App. occasionly freezes up. Maybe latest upgrade fixed issue? Other wise, it delivers what is promises. I recomend this application.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is so much fun. I love it. Great game. The graphics are good and it is funnny too. Worth the $0.99.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps me entertained long enough and its fun how you can unlock different games.blab blah blah blah fun blah blah (just doing this to get points) lolz
B007C7UZIG|5.0|This seems like such a no-brainer, Steam on our mobile devices! You won't be able to play your Steam games on Kindle Fire but you can send instant messages to your friends, see your account details, browse the store and buy games. There is even a special tab that shows all of the current sales.<br /><br />Presentation is well laid out for a tablet interface and navigating through all of the functions is smooth. There was some very brief loading time while sending messages to friends but nothing to complain about. You'll never have to worry about missing out on a Steam sale again!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Having grown up as a teen in the early 80's, Van Halen was always a go-to source of great tunes. It's always sad when a good thing comes to an end... such was the case with Van Halen when Roth left. The Hagar years were a complete joke and a great loss of an old friend (the original VH). The Hagar version of VH was always like a knife being twisted in my back, reminding me of what was lost... MOCKING ME! DAMN YOU HAGAR!<br />Well this release has made me think I must be dreaming, because it is as good and perhaps even BETTER than some of the original line-up's releases. Some tunes even give a run to some of the proggier stuff on 1984. It's also one of those great albums where the more you listen, the more you discover with each play-through. Can't recommend it enough!
B0053VKP8S|4.0|I got this to connect the optical output of an Apple TV to a mixer that connects to speakers around the house. Works just fine. There is a static problem when the Apple TV goes to sleep and wakes up but this resolves itself quickly. It's not specific to the Apple TV -- I had the same problem with the composite output from the TV.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This was a great book. It was recommended to me by a friend and it is worth the money. It is a enjoyable book if you are looking for something new.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love chit ninja because It is reply fun to play you slice the food. I love you babe dtalar
B006VRZ5YM|5.0|I rented this movie thinking it would be a typical chick flick,, I was wrong, It is really funny. I was laughing out loud. I think men would find this movie funny as well. Anna is hilarious, i like her, i find her funny. The guy in the movie is cute too, that helps. It reminded me of a different kind of humor, kinda, like Bridesmaids. I like the new direction some \\"chick flicks\\" are taking!!
B00406TRU4|2.0|Not one of my favorites...characters not very likable...series very slow placed... overall and could not even finish watching the series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game for how easy it is to play.  my hands shake and that can make me pick twice off the stack when I only wanted to pick one.
B006ON41FC|5.0|good game. keeps telling me to review it though kind of annoying. oh well, it is a good game so go for it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This DVD is wonderful, and warmly received by me.  I was so afraid I'd miss some of the episodes on TV, but with my copy of Season 2, I was not worried.  I really like a DVD, because it has outtakes included, and little bios on the unknows and known actors in the series.  Teriffic acting, in a beautiful setting and no murders or CSI graphically depicted!<br />What a winnining combo!!  Love it all.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I've found this particular solitaire better than others offered, so take a chance and try it on your kindle fire you won't regret having done so!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it seriously a wonderfull app some of the games are hard but you get the hang of it kids love it too
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My granddaughter suggested this book to me and from the very start of it I was captivated!  Now I will have to purchase the follow-up books. Was really excited to see that a movie is coming out this month also. I'll be sure to go just to see the words become visual!  I suggest this book to all. Enjoy!!!!!  :)
B006JSXYPA|2.0|I've tried watching this movie twice now and have fallen asleep about half way through each time.  The opening plot is really boring and the 3D is flat and uninteresting.  Good 3D needs to have a few things flying out of the screen once in a while ... this doesn't.  My friends tell me the ending is pretty good but I've never stayed conscious long enough to see it.<br /><br />My advise - get the new Resident Evil 3D instead - if you like stuff flying around this has it --- POW!<br /><br />Cheue
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would highly recommend buying this book. Very, Very, interesting concept. Collins knows how to draw you in and keep you reading. And thats where the problem lay, especially if you have chores to do; you wont get to them until you finish the novel. Husband happy, wife mad........
B004XNPQUO|3.0|I like that its an adobe air based game, those are always nice on android. however,  the game looked and sounded cool until I watched the video demo... even though I shove everything onto my Galaxy Tab/Galaxy S2's SD card (whether the app says it can or not lol) I'm still not about to waste any of my remaining 28GB on this...other than a few good hits, the Amazon daily freebie has been an epic FAIL.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! I only have 1 suggestion: I wish I could download the NLT version to use offline. But besides that, I very strongly recommend this app to all!
0061703087|5.0|Very cool idea. Michael Crichton is a great writer. He makes you believe nonobots could really sprout artificial intelligence. Enjoyed this immensely.
B005K17RU0|1.0|a decent app when it works but it is very frustrating as it is plagued by frequent inadvertent shut downs
B002NC8JEC|5.0|THIS IS IT this is what i wanted when i bought it. it a terrific CD I really enjoyed listing to this CD
B003S897UK|5.0|Anybody who likes the \\"MULE\\" will not be dissapointed with this 3 CD set!!! Great LIVE MUSIC!!!! Turn it on, sit back, and enjoy the ride!! Great Cruzin Tunes!!!
B004EBT5CU|2.0|Rolling in the Deep is a great song and there is no disputing Adele has a wonderful voice.  Unfortunately the sound quality<br />of this CD is compressed, shallow and just bad. Listen to the CD on a inexpensive radio or cheap ear plugs and it won't make a difference.  Another example of the negative results of digital recording.
006197806X|5.0|I had high expectations for Pandemonium, and it surpassed them completely. Instead of clinging to the format and storyline of Delirium, Pandemonium launches off the foundation already built, stepping up the action and emotional electricity from page to page. The tension throughout the story was incredible. Oliver makes the characters so real and so emotionally powerful that I couldn't stop reading. I had to know what was going to happen next, and I couldn't predict where even the next page would take me. Incredible, incredible sequel. I think I might go crazy waiting for Requiem.
0446581356|2.0|My 19yodd just recently purchased this book, as we both love anything makeup, hair, etc, but she had me in absolute stitches telling me some of the advice given in this book.  Don't get me wrong, it's great for a complete beginner who doesn't know anything about makeup, but almost everything in this book is the basics that most people already know...i.e.:  for bridal makeup she advises to use natural light for application, concealer or corrector for darkness under eyes, blend eye makeup well, as photographs will pick up visible makeup lines, hydrate, eat smart, take a relaxing bath...what the?  The section on special occasion makeup she says to use foundation to as needed to cover blemishes and even out the skin tone, use a brighter blush, use shimmer on lips, eyes and or cheeks, use a darker shade of lipstick, spritz on a warm, sensual fragrance...what the?  For the section on makeup during pregnancy, she suggests if you have no natural glow to use blush and in the bad day beauty page she gives a list of basic, no brainers - stay hydrated, curl lashes to open up the eyes, fake a tan, cover bruises with foundation and concealer and one that had my dd and me rolling, 'dark eye glass frames really come in handy on some days' (she lists her fav as Ray Bans).  She advises teens to 'not use makeup to look older' and in one section on moisturizing and sun protection she says 'for dry, chapped, or cracked lips, apply a balm formulated specifically for lips'...duh.<br />Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of good pages on doing a smoky eye, doing the eyebrows, but not alot of step by step looks for anything different that most would already know how to do.  It also seems to be a plug for her own makeup line, and some extra chapters toward the end on becoming a makeup artist.  For those like my dd and myself, we just want to learn some new techniques that the pros use, not how to make it a career.<br />If your a Bobbi Brown fan, you'll be pleased, but if you just want tolearn new stuff beside the basics, look elsewhere.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I only played 9 games so far, but they are a great way to pass the time. you can earn points easily and you able to open other games rather quickly. Once you choose a game, tap the &quot; ?&quot; on the bar and learn how to play.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|this is the worst game ever all you do is sit there and want an hour for your food to be ready
B005S7GT32|4.0|I like the Album much as I like almost everything PG has has ever done.  I didn't find it all that different from the versions I already have, sure it is orchestrated but it is presented quite the same.  But I have a very high tolerance for PG's work.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Do not like. Horribly written speaking from one who does not write well either. Too much violence and forcing children to kill, too much focus on makeup and design and not enough on plot and character development. No history of how things came to be (except district 13 rebellion  and downfall) and the fall of the previous country to usher in this crazy government.  At least the movie was far better because other writers improved on it.
B004VD3YIM|3.0|need more places locally to view. picture quality could be improved. most times I only get two cameras running and one is always orange
B0066W1AZK|5.0|As a \\"reasonable\\" chess player, this app gives me all I need at 50% difficulty.  If I had a complaint (and it is very minor) it would be not enough graphical distinction between the King and Queen.  Otherwise it makes the few minutes I spend waiting blissful.  Thanks.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app has gotten a lot better.  I use it regularly now.  It was slow, but now it runs great, and I like the maps.  Definitely worth downloading if you're a weather addict like me.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|love this game! very fun. beat all the boards, went back and got all the ribbons/trophies, then went back and got all 3 stars! wish there were more levels.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|If you read Eric Reis's Lean Startup and thought \\"great - but how do I *do* this\\" - this is the book for you.<br /><br />Good solid practical advice on adopting Customer Development and a Lean Startup approach to your business.
B005SZAEYO|5.0|This is seriously the best horror/mind bending flick I've seen in a long time.  Week after week I did not want the episodes to end and couldn't believe how the time flew while watching it.  After the first episode it leaves you hanging like \\"what on earth just happened?!\\" But by the 2nd episode you're hooked and wanting more!  When this season was playing on FX...the next morning a colleague and I would discuss the episode and what we thought was going to happen next or what we thought was currently going on.  My husband and I generally watch shows we like together (on the weekends - thanks DVR!), but both of us liked this so much we couldn't wait to watch it and did so independently and would talk about it after we both saw it.  I can only hope that the 2nd season is just as fantastic as the first.  If you don't like dark movies about the paranormal, then you're not going to like this...but for the rest of us, it was a treat!
0439023521|5.0|I'm very pleased that I was able to purchase this book for a really cheap price and came in faster than I thought it would! The book is brand new and I am currently reading the book and I'M HOOKED! I definitely recommend this book to everyone! Enjoy!

B000L3CHC0|3.0|I have had this watch for 4 years now and have always liked it. It is a great value due to the swiss movement, 200m water resistance and sapphire crystal. I do have some minor issues/peeves with this one though. The end links are not solid, the sapphire crystal has proven to be of excellent durability however lacks an anti-reflective coating, the polished parts of the bracelet scratch easily and is almost impossible to correct which is why I removed the bracelet alltogether and put a lovely black leather (breitling style). I do have minor issues with the crown as well when adjusting the date...but that could just be me. also the lume quality is kind of poor.
B006ON41FC|3.0|the game is ok and the graphics are ok, but the auto connect to open feint is really annoying. blah blah
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Former Confederate Civil War soldier, Captain John Carter has nothing left to fight for when he finds himself transported to a desert planet. Suddenly among a warrior tribe of four-armed aliens and a beautiful princess, Carter ends up in the middle of another war. But when faced with the chance of returning home to Earth, Carter may have found a cause worth fighting for in Princess Dejah and the people of Barsoom.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch stars as John Carter, the bitter and destitute man who cares for nothing but his found cave of gold. Kitsch has a young face and stoic countenance, perfect for the role of the ageless John Carter. He's a believable fighter and a great straight man to plenty of humor. Princess Dejah is played by Lynn Collins, who has terrific chemistry with John Carter, and is just as strong and smart as her male counterparts (if not more). Mark Strong and Dominic West are fantastic villains, especially West as a surprisingly charming and attractive (though naïve) despot. And my favorite characters in the novel (Princess of Mars) as well as the film were the Tharks, played by Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church and Samantha Morton. Though CGI, the characters still brought depth, emotion, and humor and successfully brought Burroughs' characters to life.<br /><br />Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic Princess of Mars (published in 1917), John Carter is a surprising and exceptional retelling. I recently read Princess of Mars in anticipation for the film. And though the film doesn't delve into the depth of the Tharks' stories as I would have liked, it still captures the spirit of the novel. And the natives of Barsoom get an impressive technology upgrade, and the science is updated for the awe-factor in the film.<br /><br />I had my reservations after seeing the official trailers. But I was happy to see that the screen writers and director Andrew Stanton knew what they were doing, even if the marketing was off. This fan was captivated from beginning to end and loved every minute of this epic adventure. Full of fascinating characters, life-like aliens, and advanced technology - science fiction fans will certainly enjoy John Carter.  But the action-packed thrills, suspense, drama, romance, and incredible story will appeal to a wide range of new fans - of all ages. It's heart-warming, inspirational, and highly entertaining.

B0071MDA2U|1.0|Words cannot describe how much I hate these new Kindle audio/video features. You're traveling into this imaginary world the author has skillfully created, just to be violently torn back out by turning to a page that prominently features the author starring at me from a badly lit video screen. I'm in the middle of reading about a place that has no running water,  I don't want to be reminded of \\"digital features\\" right now! Furthermore, I don't want to see the author or hear her \\"real-life\\" voice because I am enjoying her writing voice.  It takes me completely out of the story. Am I the only one who feels like that? I tried to figure out how to turn these features off, no luck so far. Frankly I think there should be an option to buy a Kindle version without all that stuff.
0920668372|5.0|I brought this book as a valrntines gift for my Son, my husband had been looking 4 it for aabout a year but couldnt find it until i tried online!! my husband was more excited then my 2Y0 because his mother use to read it 2 him and she past away b4 our son was born which would have been her 1st grandson so this book means alot to bout the men in my life!!
0143039431|5.0|I read this thing once every couple of years. Phenomenally written. Especially timely given today's times.  The story of the Joad family forced off of their land by the Depression.  Driven to search for work in far-off California.  Beautifully drawn characters that will make you angry and then make you cry.  A tremendous piece of American literature.<br /><br />Copy was clean, tight and well printed.  This one should last me ten years unless I lend it away again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am so thankful for this app. I love that you can read from many versions and also the the plans and devotionals.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|My wife had to do a paper for school on disorders and addictions and this movie was perfect. It's a older movie hard to find. The shipping cost more than the movie but overall was still less than half the price of a new one. It was like new as described.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was so awesome that I almost ate my butt.  itwas so much fun and I beat it all so mucch fun.
B001NFNFF8|4.0|If you're a James Lee Burke fan you'll love this movie.  Tommy Lee plays a great 'Dave Robicheaux' though Mary Steenburgen is little used as Bootsie.  I was a little ticked off to see that the movie version of 'Tripod' had all four legs. (Couldn't they find a Veterinarian willing to help with continuity?) John Goodman plays 'Baby Feet' and looks like he really enjoyed the part.<br /><br />The film is a gift to the writer's fans.  Shot in New Iberia and Teche Bayou. People unfamiliar with Burke might find the film a bit disjointed and some of the characters are poorly developed (like Alafair, Dave's daughter) Heck, Cletus Purcell never even makes an appearance.<br /><br />Beautifully shot on HD you get a real feel for the country and towns.  Tommy Lee is superior to Alec Baldwin's version of Robicheaux in the 1996 'Heaven's Prisoners'. After seeing the film my wife and I drove from Florida to Teche Bayou.  We found the Teche Motel where they shot the scene where Robicheaux's buddy allegedly kills himself. Spent the night in the same cottage (#12) and loved every minute of it.  The motel owner's name is Rosebud.  Just tell her you want to stay where those 'Movie People' were.  $40 a night to be part of filmdom. Rosebud will excitedly tell you the whole story.  Apparently she and Tommy Lee are on a first name basis.<br /><br />A great whodunit for most people.  For Burke fans who already know the ending it's like sitting back and watching a beautiful sun rise.
0545265355|5.0|Loved this series !  The subject matter initially did not appeal to me but I am so glad I relented and read these books.  In fact, I had them on my Kindle but decided to buy hard copies for my library.  The gift boxed set is high quality and a worthy addition to my collection.  Amazon provided competitive pricing and efficient delivery.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Works great and very easy to use. I would highly recommend it to keep all your fav blogs organized and ready to read.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book jumps back and forth between two perspectives but once you're hooked, you cannot put it down. I finished the book in 3 days because I was so intrigued by the story. It's from the viepoint of a small girl who lived through it as well as the empathetic reporter who is researching it today.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|that's the reason I'm giving this app 5 stars, I have had bad back pains lately, but I decided to try it anyway,(the ten minutes routine) it didn't hurt a bit, Within a month or two I will have the body of my dreams and the back I want.<br />it is very professionally done by the way, surely I will feel confident of purchasing more apps by this dev. And I can tell you that you can as well.
B005KELQEU|5.0|i love it. it is light weight and accessible. highly reccomend keeps my kindle safe and sound it is pretty padded too
B004XNPQUO|5.0|I don't care what the description says, there is no way that broadcasting unsecure information is necessary.  A phone game is really not worth the risk.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This book is a thoughtful summary of many lean startup principles. A great mash-up of Lean Startup, The Entrepreneur's guide to customer development, and Business Model Generation. We are using it as a textbook for an upcoming startup class here in Bellingham.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Well I really like the way Suzanne Collins writes.  The first book sucked me in. The second book kept me going.  The third book wrapped it all up and gave closure.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that some parts seemed to be rushed through, where I felt like she could have elaborated more. Pleased with the ending though.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|So amazing, great work of an incredible artistic genius. I have watched it countless times and never, ever get bored. He was an amazing human being and he is missed. This gives such a great preview of what would've been.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is an incredibly simple and fun game. Something to pass a few minutes at a party, while you're waiting for some people, or waiting to start up a tabletop game, this is a good time killer.
B004L49K2A|3.0|This latest album was okay.  The song Girl Panic! was by far the best song on the album.  The Man who Stole a Leopard was not bad either.  However, I liked Astronaut better.  I did not buy their previous album, RCM, so I can't compare.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I give solitaire for kindle fire 5 stars. Great solitaire game to play, which also has different playing and scoring options. I would totally suggest getting this app if your a solitaire fan, and its free
B004FOA84A|4.0|Short,  but entertaining for an evening. I would enjoy playing something like this again. Hopefully something a little longer though.
B0025KVLUQ|1.0|I purchased a CD of the Remastered version of The Beatles Abbey Road album.  When I received it I placed it in the CD drive of my Windows XP computer and got a warning that I had to download \\"QuickTime\\" to play the CD.  So, I did.  However, when I inserted the CD into my PC the only thing that played was a short DVD video of an interview with the Beatles with excerpts of their songs playing in the background.  There didn't appear to be anyway to play any of the songs on the CD.  I tried again this morning to listen to the CD, including downloading supposedly a more recent copy of \\"QuickTime\\", but there still was no way offered to listen to the music on the CD.  I called Apple support at 1-800-676-2775 and was told that I would have to PAY them additional money in order to listen to their CD.  I told them, that they were full of crap and that I would return the CD before I payed them to figure out what the problem was with THEIR product!  I thought Apple products were supposed to be user friendly.  Based upon my experience that's a lie.  Apple should be ashamed of their conduct!<br /><br />So, be aware of the problems you might have with this CD, if you own a Windows PC.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liked it a lot to do, helps pass the time at work. I really injoyed it a lot, so I would buy it
B0062NAX1U|4.0|This movie is an uplifting and powerful story. It is not \\"preachy\\" and deals with real life issues. There is a challenge for men to step up and act as role models for their families and friends, and also women too, who are in relationships with these men. Though the movie is over 2 hours long, it went very quickly.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|a totally unfinished story. the author didn't finish this series, he just stopped writing. so many interesting story lines, plots and sub plots developed and none of them finished. when I started to read the last book i wondered how he was going to tie all these loose ends together. he didn't. he just continued spinning his tale until he got tired of writing and then walked away.<br />weak. Very weak. A most unsatisfying series
B004VMUS9G|2.0|this is battery draining app for sure. set my alarm clock. woke up with my kindle fire dead. c'mon man.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Definitly lets you relax! smooth game play and multiple options, very surprising for a free app.<br />It is a must download for all ages.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This is a must read book and would be especially helpful for politicians. Michael Lewis writes in a fascinating and entertaining fashion and introduces the reader to the world of finance and credit default swaps in a language everyone is able to understand. It is a book which will alter the perspective of anyone who reads it. People should read this before they are allowed to vote.
0143119680|5.0|I love this book soooooooo much. It is better than Twilight and is really complex and is not all romance and sex.I am really excited for the sequel!! And there is going to be a movie!
1451648537|5.0|Not knowing that much about Steve Jobs other than what I read on the internet or heard from others it was nice to finally read about him & what motivated him.  While I don't share or agree with his religious beliefs & how he treated others I admire what he did & how grounded he remained despite his wealth.<br /><br />The author did a good job of walking through the life of Steve Jobs & highlighting the significant events in his life.  The book was an easy read but was very engaging.  I've never read 600+ pages in such a short period of time.  I will deinitely read more books by Walter Issacson.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|I've been a fan of Robert Glasper's music for several years.  Whether with The Experiment or a trio, I love the purity of his style and sound.  This release takes it to another level with the help of several acclaimed and talented vocalists.  When I found out about \\"Black Radio\\" a few months ago, I pre-ordered the CD from Amazon and waited patiently for the album release concert in NYC on 2/28 featuring, Bilal, Mos Def, Chrisette Michele and Layla Hathaway.  I loved the concert and CD so much, I went back on the 2/29 to see The Experiment play again.  This time, Ledisi, Lupe Fiasco, MeShell Ndegeocello were the featured vocalists.  I couldn't think of a better reason to stay out until 1:00AM two weeknights in a row when I have to be in the office by 7:30.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Buy the CD, mp3 or vinyl,[[ASIN:B0067Q04AM Black Radio]]then find out when The Experiment is playing at a venue near you, buy tickets and GO!  If you're a fan of Neo-Soul you will gain a new appreciation for Jazz while you fall in love with this music.  This is the best Pseudo-Pop Jazz album I've ever had the privilege of listening to.<br /><br />I would have given it SIX stars, but Erykah Badu didn't show up at either concert.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I read a review saying this is what Eric Ries' book (The Lean Startup) should have been, which is partly true. I was also a bit disappointed with Eric's book in that it was more superficial than I hoped for, but I think his goal was to popularize the idea beyond converts like me. In any case, Ash Maurya filled the gap by Eric left by providing a detailed, highly practical user manual that wonderfully complements The Lean Startup.  It gives you step by step processes, detailed advice, examples - the whole enchilada. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in putting the Lean Startup methodology to work.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This Blu-Ray disc arrived in perfect condition and earlier than estimated.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I think it is a masterpiece and I do not purchase movies unless I am certain I will want to revisit the film in the future. So I put 'District 9' in the same great category as 'No Country for Old Men,''There Will Be Blood' and 'Pan's Labyrinth.'<br /><br />All of these movies are unique from one another but I love them all for just that reason - uniquely amazing.
B004XNPQUO|1.0|Doesn't work on the Droid X.  Goes to black screen and then nothing.  Uninstalling.  Glad I didn't pay for it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is super awesome but very addicting so definately don't start playing unless u want to be addicted to it
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I was looking for and quick and easy way to write on my kindle and have access to it everywhere. just what I needed
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use it on both my EVO3D and Transformer Prime on ICS. Always there when I need some word. I love the read to me feature along with the added extras with a login.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|it makes me laugh how people give this app bad reviews just because they themselves are fat or lazy. or thy try to say something cool like they already know all these moves. or they give it a bad rating because they already workout there and every day!. well say gold for you but honestly who cares. Hahaha I think its a good app it will help me work out my and every day.
B00067BBQE|5.0|If you like Evanescence and have wondered how good they are in concert, this DVD is for you.  Yes, the cameras are all over the place, just like your eyes are when you're at the show.  Amy Lee sings like you hoped every contestant on American Idol or X-Factor would sing.  The band shows they are truly Metal based, and the mixing is absolutely perfect.  If you are on the ropes, like I was, BUY IT.. it's a great addition to your collection.
B0036EH3UC|4.0|This DVD contains all of the content you need to enjoy Battlestar Galactica:<br />Miniseries<br />Seasons 1 through 4<br />Razor<br />The Plan<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of the things that prompted us to buy this series in this fashion was the inclusion of subtitles. For all of the fantastic storytelling, this cast (and the casts on many modern shows) just don't know how to enunciate when they speak. The subtitles are invaluable, but are nowhere to be found on the final episode - exactly where we wanted them most. Very huge disappointment after enjoying the series up until this part.
B004LWZW4W|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Animal testing goes wrong when the chemicals start making the apes intelligent and decide to fight back. A prequel to the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />The film is great across the board, story, pacing and action. But, the make or break of this film was the CGI apes. If the apes weren't believable, this film wouldn't have worked. Thankfully, the CGI is fantastic and the performances from Mr CGI himself Andy Serkis (Gollum - Lord of the Rings) make us believe in them. So much so, I think I would rather join the ape side than the humans.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />When was last time you saw an ape takes out a helicopter?<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The film was a huge box office success with $479m grossed worldwide (budget: $93m)
B002OMZTSK|4.0|Middle - end got my interest...<br />its sad at the end in my view...<br />It is pretty good.<br />you may think this leads to sex or what not.. but doesn't it's a short romance and friend ship..
B00127RAJY|4.0|So after a while of getting sick of paying gym fees (for a gym I never go to because I travel a lot for work, and it's nice to just be home for a little while at the end of the day before I have to rush off to the next commitment), I've been exploring the world of workout DVDs. I've heard great things about Jillian from a lot of people, and this looked like a great workout. I love it, but I definitely would not follow this program the way Jillian lays it out:<br /><br />1. You're supposed to do this video everyday. That's not safe or smart. Muscle groups need to be given time to heal over a day or two, so I choose to alternate this video with yoga as well (this also helps stretch my muscles out the day after a hard workout).<br /><br />2. There's nowhere near enough stretching at the beginning of this video. Jillian talks about how you shouldn't do static stretching at the beginning of the workout - BAD IDEA. The first time I did this DVD, I couldn't walk normally for 4 DAYS because my quads had been destroyed so bad. So now I do my own round of static stretching before I start the DVD, and I haven't had another problem since.<br /><br />The short version? Great DVD if you take a few precautions...
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ernest Cline is one of those dudes that proves Austin residents are freaking awesome. Ready Player One is a fantastically geektastic book of epic proportions with an equally fantastic social message or 5 wrapped up inside the 80's nerdfest.<br /><br />As plenty of others have stated, this book takes place in a world both like and vastly unlike our own. Energy, food, health, and economic problems have grown to a point where a sizable segment of the world spends most of their time (work and free) living their lives in an immersive online environment. Addicted to Facebook? Twitter? Pintrest? Youtube? 4Chan? Then you'll have no problems connecting to characters who find freedom and society within the realms of OASIS, an expansive MMO that has taken the place of the 2D internet we are so familiar with today.<br /><br />The creator of this world, a massive fan of pop culture (specifically early video games and 80's entertainment), dies leaving behind a massive fortune and OASIS itself to the first person who discovers his Easter Egg.<br /><br />The book follows one young man on his journey through a life of relative, net-based anonymity and an obsession with the 1980s and all other aspects of pop culture that might aid him in his quest for the Egg. Along the way he forms frenemies in a few other players, and true enemies in the form of a giant mega-corporation bent on privatizing OASIS with monthly fees and advertising (oh no! Second Life!).<br /><br />Ready Player One will tug at every nostalgia button you have. Whether it's video games, movies, tv shows books, or music if you have any love at all for nerd culture or 80s pop culture then this is a book you will absolutely devour and love with all your fantasy-loving heart. If you just like action, interesting characters, and good writing ... well then you can devour it too!<br /><br />Now I'm off to find a copy of Adventure on the interwebs! Happy reading!
B005NQ94LM|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />A girl and a guy meet and spend the night together, then we follow the couple through out their lives on the same day of each year.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Firstly, I have not read the book, will not read the book, and firmly believe that a book and a film can not be compared, as they are two copmpletely different mediums. The only exception is if there are absolutely major changes to the characters or the story. So, having said that, the film is great. The concept of having the story take place on only one day in a year is very clever, therfore, keeping you fully intrigued in the characters and the journey of their relationship. The two main actors do a great job. Jim Sturgess does come across as slightly annoying, but criticism of Anne Hathaway's accent are slightly unfair. The story is beatutiful and real, and definately worth watching.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The touching finale -- I won't spoil it.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The film is based on the book, of the same name, and the screenplay of the film is also written by the author, David Nicholls.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This is a fast read, and a useful one.  I really liked the case studies and the practical advice.  For anyone who is just starting out, there has to be at least a few lessons in here that will save a mountain of headache.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I really like the game and the star system.  My only complaint is that the game frequently drops when you are near the end and need to shuffle the tiles.  It is very frustrating when you are having a good game with a great time and it \\"force close\\" and the game just drops.  This happens approximately 1 of 5 times.  I also don't like that it adds a minute to your time when you need to shuffle your tiles.  If those two issues were fixed it would be perfect.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Great read, however, terribly disturbing.<br />Couldn't wait to see what happened next.  The liquid plumber.....don't want to spoil it...<br />Worth the purchase....you will never believe the ending!!
B005FUTBV4|3.0|What's it about?<br /><br />A group of teens join an internet community to find sex, only to be tricked and kidnapped by a violent and disturbing cult, run by an evil leader.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />A huge departure from comedy styling's of Kevin Smith, but ultimately, a decent one.  A top performance from Michael Parks as the cult leader and some genially surprising moments make this one worth seeing. Might make you think twice about online dating.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />One of the teens tries to escape the compound - edge of your seat stuff.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Kevin Smith self distributed the film in selected US cinemas.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|Woody Allen's latest is one of his best in a long time. It's a romantic ode to Paris and the giants of ages past that includes lots of sly humor, along the lines of some of his earlier greats such as \\"Love and Death,\\" which I believe is Allen's favorite of his films. As usual with most Allen films, this one sports a terrific cast, even from its cameo stars like Adrien Brody. Sometimes it's hard to get past Owen Wilson channeling Allen in the role (for me, anyway), but the other actors more than make up for it by providing stellar support. The message of the film is a fairly simple one, but it's done extremely well, and should be a lesson to us all.
1449305172|5.0|Running Lean has been an instrumental part of the development of our first product.  We decided early last year that we would bootstrap our development, so not wasting time and resources was paramount.<br /><br />Ash does a great job of laying out a step by step thought process and providing valuable examples throughout the book.  We've definitely become disciples through our active use of the book and Lean Canvas.<br /><br />I can't say enough about how important this has been to our success over the past year.
0525478817|5.0|I find it very rare when a book strikes an emotional chord with me. I'm not one to cry at sappy romances or when a character I love dies. Actually, I've never felt like crying over any book before. But The Fault in Our Star was brimming heart wrenching emotion, and I found myself beautifully heartbroken for the characters.<br /><br />Hazel is a seventeen year old girl living in the aftermath of a long, hard battle with thyroid cancer. After a seemingly \\"miracle\\" drug helps get Hazel's cancer under control, she still has to live with her faulty lungs and carrying an oxygen tank with her where ever she goes.<br /><br />When her parents think that Hazel is sinking into a lonely depression, they make her go to a cancer support meeting in the \\"literal heart of Jesus\\" where she can talk and cope with her disease with fellow teenagers that share her pain. There she meets Augustus Waters, a one legging cancer survivor who impresses Hazel with his bookish smarts and quirky attitude. A relationship doomed from the start, Augustus and Hazel set out to find the answers to some important questions about life, and coming to terms with the fact that we all must die.<br /><br />Though this book is about cancer and death, and might be assumed to be a sad and depressing read, that is simply not so. Despite the grim circumstances these characters are in, this book is actually brimming with life and humor.  John Green does a fantastic job of making the characters come alive, and not making you feel sad for Hazel and Augustus, but rather proud of the life they choose to live.<br /><br />For the most part, I thought this book was fantastic. There were a few little holes that keep me from calling it a favorite, and for the sake of being spoiler free I won't go into details.<br /><br />This book lives up to all the praise and hype it has received. I recommend it to those who love a good contemporary YA novel full of dry humor and lovable characters. The Fault In Our Stars is worth your time and money.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />A group of young kids making a zombie film witness a horrific train crash, and capture on their Super 8 camera much more than they anticipated.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Having been produced by Steven Spielberg, you definitely get the 80's ET & Goonies-esq vibe of the film, but with a darker tone to it. The characters of the film and their interactions in the community are actually the most interesting part of the film. It is only when the `mystery' of the film takes on a science fiction twist that it removes you from the reality of the film it has expertly built up, therefore causing your concentration to waver slightly. So by the end, you are left debating if what you watched was just a good film, or an amazing film?<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Prepare yourself for the train crash; it'll blow your speakers apart!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The famous bicycle from Steven Spielberg's movie E.T. can be seen as a part of metal junk that is being attached to the water tower in one of the final scenes.

B0054JELS4|3.0|I bought NCIS Season 1-8 during one of those \\"sales\\" they have during the day several months ago, knowing it would make a excellent Christmas gift for my wife who loves the show. As she made her way through the seasons, she really had a great time seeing the episodes in order.  Unfortunately, in Season 7 and Season 8 several of the discs have difficulty loading.  I've cleaned the discs, cleaned the disc player with one of those DVD discs with the small microscopic brushes, but they still have problems.  Of the five players we have in the house, those discs do not play on a Samsung Blu-Ray player (with updated firmware) and a Sony Blu-Ray player.  Since I ordered the series early for Christmas, I missed the \\"window\\" for returning them, so, buyer beware of this issue.<br /><br />NOTE:  I noticed that Amazon had this same special a few days ago (May 2012).  I would suggest that anyone buying the set play all of the discs ASAP, and return the set if any do not load correctly.  If enough people return them, Amazon will get something straightened-out.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Tin Tin sets out on adventure to find the golden unicorn and the treasure that awaits, before the evil Red Rackham gets his hands on it.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Having watched the cartoons and read the comics, you can imagine my delight and relief, as a fan, when the film was announced as collaboration between Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg. Why is that important? Because I had the upmost faith it would be a brilliant film and faithful to Herge's creation. Thank god, I wasn't let down! The brilliance of the film starts from the very cool opening titles with John Williams' amazing, nostalgic score, and from there it doesn't let up. Performances of all the cast was outstanding, with special shout out to Serkis as the bumbling, drunk Captain Haddock. The CGI is immensely detailed, with the character expression the best I have seen in a film. This adaptation will go down as a classic!<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />There's plenty to choose! However, the opera scene is particularly great for its tension and drama.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The film is based on three of Herge' books: The Crab with the Golden Claws(1941), The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944)
0553350005|5.0|Here is a classic murder mystery by Agatha Cristy.<br /><br />Eight people get letters to attend a free vacation at a home on Indian Island. Plus there is a new butler and his housekeeping wife. Turns out these ten are past killers who have escaped punishment for their crimes. A systematic elimination of each of them takes place done in step with the \\"Ten little Indians song\\" by a mad killer. Is the killer on the island or is it one of the ten in the house?<br /><br />The story reads fast and the book is a page burner. I read the 194 page book in one day. The reader wants to read on as he/she tries  to find clues who the killer might be. Just look at all the 5 star reviews. I'm going to get more Agatha Cristy used mystery books to add to our family library. And Then There were None.... 5 stars

0307279189|3.0|I need to tell my old college coach that my problem wasn't drinking too much beer, my problem was not drinking enough beer.<br /><br />Entertaining book, well-written narrative. It took a long time to get to the flash point that most of these reviews are commenting about, foot strike and barefoot running. My own observations after 40 years of running on these two items: Barefoot running - I found barefoot running about 10 years ago. I was on vacation at the beach and did not bring my running shoes because my calves were in such bad shape. However the urge to run was overwhelming so I took off down the beach. After 2 miles of a 6 mile run my calves felt great. Benefits of bare foot running were that I could run about 7% faster. Cons, really painful on the knees the next morning. Foot strike - I'm not sure what all the arguing is about. This seems to be a no-brainer to me. When you run slow and/or walk you heel strike. As you begin to pick up speed, anything under a 5 min. mile pace, you begin to land farther towards the front of your foot, until you are sprinting on your toes.<br /><br />If you are looking for workouts and training practices, best pass on this book.

1594484805|2.0|Although much of this information will be new to some it has been available for a long time.  I agree that the information is not main stream and is valuable and relevant however, he is not aware of the latest scientific research on human behavior.  Adding an understanding of Perceptual Control Theory (William T. Powers) to Pink's assessment of motivation would have taken the reader far beyond what he has to offer.  There is only one type of motivation it is internal, the only thing that can be external are incentives which may or may not influence another person.  Most theories of human behavior including those proposed in Drive fall short and are credible only 90+% of the time.  If you want an explanation that is accurate 100% of the time read Making Sense of Behavior by William T. Powers or A People Primer: The Nature of Living Systems by Shelley A.W. Roy.
B00563K3DA|1.0|This book takes many, many pages to say in a remarkably roundabout and flowery way something that can be expressed in a sentence: take good care of yourself, both physically and spiritually, and your life will improve. At first I was intrigued (the author did a good job with the title), then bored, then embarrassed by the fact that I am continuing to read all this artificial New Age babble waiting for a revelation around the corner. If you are looking at this book and considering purchasing it, save yourself from disappointment: buy a good book on yoga, read it and follow the advice. At least it will be written in an adult-level language and based on solid foundation, not on an imaginary tale where beautiful sages wearing white robes and flower garlands play heavenly music and meditate with expression of utter peace and contentment on their wrinkle-free faces - and did I mention they all were old but ageless?
B005RYF5JA|3.0|Now before I start my review I want to first prove that I'm a Celtic Woman fan because I'm sure what I have to say about this performance will upset some of the more dedicated Celtic Woman fans. In addition to having almost every CD, DVD, and solo album I traveled from SF to the city of Quebec, literally from one end of the continent to the other to see former CW member Meav perform at the Quebec Celtic Music Festival, and it was well worth the journey.<br /><br />Now with regards to CW Believe I'm afraid that the group has hit its all time low...<br /><br />First off the group has only three singers; CW prior to this has always had at least 4 singers (CW New Journey had 5 singers) and you can clearly see/hear the difference with one less singer. And personally I feel that they tried to substitute this with what I felt was cheap theatrics such as all the dancing and the confetti at the end.<br /><br />Second, I feel that Lisa Lambe falls short of the mark; now she is a very good singer with a very lovely voice but I feel that she fails to measure up to previous CW members such as Meav or Lynn who are exceptional singers.<br /><br />And thirdly, I feel that the show wasn't very Celtic; Mairead was really the only celtic element in the performance. It seemed like they had very few celtic songs when they normally have a even balance between celtic, pop, and classical music; this performance had mostly pop songs. Personally I think that CW became less celtic when Orla Fallon left.<br /><br />Now saying all that I still enjoyed watching the concert, I thought it was well done and very entertaining; I particularly loved the songs \\"Bridge over Troubled Waters\\", \\"Téir Abhaile Riú\\", \\"Green Grow The Rushes\\", and \\"Ave Maria\\"

B001ANSS5K|4.0|4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this book. John Green is a wonderful writer. I was intrigued throughout the whole book, so I read it in just a couple days. I couldn't put it down. I agree with some of the other reviews that the main characters are similar to the others in other books, but I kinda like that! He captures the characters personality very well and you really feel like you know them.

B00457X7XQ|3.0|There was a lot to like about this book. For the most part it is a fast-paced, well written thriller.  What really gets in the way, however, is the author's obsession with women's sexuality.  So many passages read like a tale of a computer nerd's fantasies.  Other than that, though, not too bad.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I purchased this book as a birthday gift for my 9-year-old nephew.  I didn't know anything about it other than the book description and what I skimmed from user reviews.  The book description intrigued me, which is why I bought it for my nephew.  Then a couple days later, I saw the book in the front window of my local bookstore.  This bookstore is pretty discriminating when it comes to what they display in their front window, so I began to think that maybe this was a book worthy of my attention.<br /><br />I had not originally intended to read Wonder because I generally don't read children's books.  However, I decided it would be fun to discuss the book with my nephew, and I needed a new book to read before my morning commute.  I downloaded the Kindle version and walked to the subway.<br /><br />I will warn you, reading this book in public may not be the best idea, especially if you are prone to allowing your emotions get away from you.  I pretty much had tears brimming in my eyes from page one, and I was actually wracked with sobs by the final few chapters.  The book is a very fast read.  It is a beautiful story about the power of human kindness.  All of the characters are fully fleshed out and have very strong character arcs.<br /><br />I am very curious to find out what my nephew thinks of the book once he reads it.  I'm not sure he will react as strongly as I did.  I do hope that he learns the lessons taught in the book about treating everyone with kindness and that you should never, ever judge a book by its cover.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for all ages.  I also recommend reading it in a safe, warm corner where you can let the tears flow without shame.  (In other words, don't read it on the subway.)
B005NPCJ88|5.0|It's great music that I've come to expect from Five Finger Death Punch. Good from the beginning to the very end. You won't be disappointed.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is one app I can't live without! Works well on my Infuse. I use it a lot. Great Job.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed this book.  The ideas are well thought out and Max Brooks has thought of several situations that would result from a zombie attack that I had not read, seen, or thought of before.  My only complaint about the book is that there is no dramatic tension.  It is written in the style of Studs Terkel's WORKING, which is a book of interviews of people looking back on their lives.  Similarly, all of WORLD WAR Z is told in flashback through interviews with various people from all over the world who were directly affected by the zombie plague.  Because of this style choice, we know every single one of these characters survived the war.  So the book becomes more of a historical perspective of the war versus a thrilling plot line of gruesome zombie attacks and heroes saving the day.<br /><br />Again, it is an interesting read and, overall, I did enjoy the book.  However, I'm not sure it is a book I would necessarily read again.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|My family LOVED this movie, but our kids are 14 and 17 - as always in Disney fashion, lots of funny stuff for the adults, lots of funny stuff for the kids.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|I absolutely depend on this app for texting and I would recommend it to anyone.<br />But I can't give it 5 stars at this time because it still has some annoying quirks that I'd like to see fixed.<br />1] Most notably, the word prediction doesn't seem to understand how capitalization works. In midsentence, it will occasionally predict the capitalized version of the word I'm typing, even if it is not a proper noun.<br />2] Also, the library doesn't accept changes for very long. My wife's name is Pam, and whenever I type her name the next suggestion is \\"Anderson\\". Pam Anderson hasn't been talked about since Borat was released, and not for years before or after that! So I removed \\"Anderson\\" from the library. But sure enough, after the next update it was back again.
B000FA675C|4.0|Although this book was very controversial, I went into it reading it with an open mind.  It was interesting, and I think that anyone who took it to be anything more than fiction was stretching things a bit.  The book was just a fun, interesting read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is good if you like physics games, free games, or bird games. Not like free version on ipod. You get all the levels and the only adds pop up in the corner and are barely noticeable.
B005UT29Z0|4.0|I guess I enjoyed this  movie, but at some points it was a little slow - It didn't stick with me at much at some other movies did, but I have to say it was worth watching. We have so many movies out that tell this type of story now & despite that I feel the movie did give an inside view of what things may really be like on the other side.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Excellent book with a riveting story line.  the trilogy is great. Amazing to think that a character who is so unlikable could grab your attention and your heart.

0061122416|5.0|I love books that convey important life-lessons artistically molded within the backdrop, or woven within the heart of a great fictional piece. The Alchemist is a story that I found very adventurious, thrilling, and emotionally moving; yet it's packed with those small and big lessons you will learn while on your journey toward any goal you set-out to undertake. With this journey you come face-to-face with various kinds of people, and run into those familiar arch-types you are bound to cross-paths with on that important life-quest. Through out this story, you go with the main character and experience how important it is in anything you do, to follow your heart, and heed both those subtle and powerful urgings you get from your: gut, instinct, intuition, psyche, subconcious, heart - whatever you love to call it. While also making good use of the knowledge and wisdom you gain along the way. You'll love this journey.

B000003CM9|5.0|This is a great classic Allman Brothers Band Album. It includes all the original members. Also, you get the late/great Berry Oakley (bass guitar player) on lead vocals on \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", and he really sings it like he means it. Also, another standout is \\"Please Call Home\\". \\"Please Call Home\\" is featured in the hard to find dvd of the Allman Brothers Band \\"Please Call Home - The Big House Years\\", which is a documentary about the Allman Brothers early years at the \\"Big House\\" in Macon, Georgia.
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|\\"Werther\\" is a sad story but I never cried with other singers' singing and acting this opera. With this version I cried from the end of the Second Act all the way to the end. The both principals are superb singing-actors and totally believable. Although from the 21st century perspective Goethe/Massenet's situation is ridiculous - but this was the age of Sturm und Drang and within the operatic setting, their story is totally believable (and enjoyable despite the tears).

This was peace time Germany & Rally's were the order of the day. There's not a lot of action in this movie but there is a lot of display. The symbols of the NSDAP, in English that's the Nationalist Social German Workers Party, in German it's Nationale Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei, are everywhere in multitudes to rival the number of attendees. This is not an easy watch & quite frankly can become boring. Even seeing the faces of the Nazi leaders can grow old though it is a great introduction to their faces.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|Moon (2009)<br />Drama, Mystery, Science Fiction, 97 minutes<br />Directed by Duncan Jones<br />Starring Sam Rockwell and the voice of Kevin Spacey<br /><br />Do you remember a time when science fiction movies relied on a strong story rather than showy special effects? That's what Moon achieves. Most of the acting is performed by Sam Rockwell, although he interacts with the voice of Kevin Spacey and a couple of other actors.<br /><br />The setting is the far side of the moon and Sam Bell (Rockwell) is mining for Helium 3, which supplies 70 percent of Earth's energy needs. His only companion is GERTY (Spacey), who resembles the HAL 9000 computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Sam spends his free time working out and carving a model village. He is two weeks away from the end of his 3-year contract and is excited about returning to Earth and seeing his wife and daughter.<br /><br />One day, while Sam is performing routine maintenance on one of the mining harvesters, he crashes. If you were the only human being within 300,000 miles, that could be quite a problem. But, somehow, Sam wakes up in the infirmary with GERTY explaining that he has suffered an accident. How did GERTY rescue him? Did someone from Earth recover Sam, or was the event dreamed or imagined? Is Sam starting to hallucinate or go crazy after three years of isolation?<br /><br />There are many subtle audio and visual clues to what is really happening, but you might miss most of them on first viewing. When you know the film's secrets, little details take on additional meaning. Note also how Jones uses what we know about 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the kind of character Spacey usually portrays, to bring us to certain conclusions about GERTY.<br /><br />We spend the first 28 minutes of the film seeing how Sam lives. At that point, something happens which changes the feel of the entire film. Events start to become much clearer. I'm reluctant to spoil the reveal for anyone who hasn't seen the film, so I'm not going to discuss the plot any further.<br /><br />Rockwell delivers a wonderful performance as the multifaceted Sam. His isolation reminds me of Cast Away, 127 Hours and I Am Legend. The film examines the psychological effects of being alone and the difficulty in dealing with the outside world when that isolation finally ends. There are also deeper themes such as morality and our fundamental freedom.<br /><br />When I look at the 2010 Oscar nominees, I have to wonder how District 9 was nominated ahead of Moon. It's also surprising that Rockwell missed out on a Best Actor nomination.<br /><br />The budget was just $5 million, and the film looks incredible when you consider how little was spent. At no time did I think anything looked unconvincing or that I wasn't on the Moon. Clint Mansell's score was also noteworthy and set the mood perfectly. Moon is told in such a subtle way, but the tension slowly builds and creeps up on you. It's a very intelligent piece of writing by Director Duncan Jones.<br /><br />If you enjoy classic science fiction and good acting, Moon is worth checking out.<br /><br />If you like Moon:<br /><br />Duncan Jones was given a $32 million budget for his next film, Source Code. It's a science fiction thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Vera Farmiga and Michelle Monaghan. It shares some of the themes present in Moon, such as freedom, morality, and key female characters appearing on a screen. Both films will make you think and the scripts are always intelligent. If Duncan Jones continues to progress at this rate, he could become the next Christopher Nolan. It's so refreshing to watch good science fiction that doesn't rely solely on special effects.g to discuss the plot any further.<br /><br />Rockwell delivers a wonderful performance as the multifaceted Sam.

B004SIIBGU|3.0|I like the app because it is an easier way to list my items and to search on the Android but one thing that I really don't like is that the view/watch count does not update from the classic site.  When you are a seller these numbers are important and I have to switch to classic site to see them.  Needs some work EBay.

Strong hero and heroine, and other characters. Funny, suspense filled, poignant, fast paced.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the next one in the series, which I dare not start as i have work to do!

B007G5FX4K|5.0|I must say that this track is much better that Gimme All Your Luvin, I love the way she sampled her own \\"Act of Contrition\\" at the beginning. It does sound a lot like Celebration mixed with Get Together but the song is really growing on me. Lyrically Madonna isn't at the top of her game with this track but who cares, it is a fun song that is sure to burn up the dance floors. The only problem is i don't think we will be hearing this song on US radio anytime soon but I can't wait to hear this song live on her tour later this year. Buy it you won't be disappointed.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Prologue<br /><br />African Slaves were the first Blacks whom had brought to the \\"New World\\" in 1619 and it was just 12 years passing from settlement of James Town. They weren't aggressive, but aggression was upon them. If so poor, but human at least were they in their motherland; but apocryphal white gods forging ahead enslave them. Promising peace and piety sent them to hell where apostasy from their fathers' belief was mandatory.<br /><br />Violence violence and a little more violence was their wage from working in their unwanted servitude in charge of others' malefactor. So gradually the common color of \\"good\\" became evil and the color of \\"evil\\" changed for innocence, a world full of Black and White.<br /><br />As time passed the so called \\"slaves\\" start to ask for their human dignity and that was a totally new phase for violent response from the \\"masters\\". Black takes a long time to fade as their hope; they hadn't been giving up and reach to what they struggle for, as once Martin Luther King Jr. said: \\"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last\\"<br /><br />Introduction<br /><br />Various dissatisfactions may result in protests in a community or a society. Religious, economical, societal and political concerns are amongst the most important factors which provoke different groups and classes to counter act against the status quo. In most of the time such displeasures end in some political gained grants, trivial or general reformations in current law and mechanism and compromise and returning to pre-challenge era. But in some occasions the depth and level of discontent is in its extreme thus the protestors are looking for a fundamental reformation or in other words revolution and subversion. Overthrow can be done by civilians or servicemen, in societal level such a protest is known as a movement. In deed, social movements are acts and processes in which some (most of time minorities but certainly not always) seek their own wills.<br /><br />From one aspect movements can be divided to violent and nonviolent. Many of social movements are peaceful at start, but different events may lead them to violence; and off course in some cases their first intended shifts to a major one and may be revolution. Reading history since 19th century shows that such procedures in China, Russia, France, Czechoslovakia, Iran and etc had been caused to revolution and regime change.<br /><br />In China peasants were against high tax which they were obliged to pay to Emperor, but the mismanagement and not tolerating of their claim, led to emerging of Marxist beliefs and Chinese masses movement led by Mao Tse-tung who was a communist teacher. Some campaigns caused to ousting the last emperor of the Qing dynasty and establishing the People's Republic of China.<br /><br />In Russia the workers were against their low wages, but the Emperor's police violently killed 5 of them, and that was the beginning of toppling Romanov's Empire. 1917 February was the time to say good bye to Kremlin, just in 8 months form then the first communist government announced by Bolsheviks led by Lenin.<br /><br />In France people had some criticisms on Empire, but neglecting their demands and treating with them brutality, expanding the bourgeoisie in state convince the people for democracy rather than dictatorship.

From 1861 to 1865 Americans \\"spoke daggers\\" to each other to understood whether they should remain masters or simply became neighbors.<br /><br />Abolitionism<br /><br />The keystones of anti slavery dates back to 1783 but the organized steps towards it began years after it. Under the leadership of William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, anti slavery campaigners succeeded in getting the slave trade to the British colonies abolished in 1807. The United States prohibited the importation of slaves that same year, though widespread smuggling continued until about 1862.<br /><br />\\"Liberator\\" read and asked for emancipation and liberation of slaves from the starting hours of 1831 frankly, if so it took 32 years for this claim to be verified. Torture was what had been done upon poor slaves, thus those religious orthodox men whom were unable to have slaves financially or there was no need for black work in their occupation echoed for \\"abolitionism\\".<br /><br />William Lloyd Garrison was one who believed in nonviolent and peaceful campaign against slavery. As the founder of the American Anti-Slavery Society (1833-70) he let the runaways Frederick Douglas and William Wells Brown to state their wishes to Northerners in his publication (North Star). But lucky he was as Elijah P. Lovejoy another American newspaper editor martyred in Alton, Illinois in defense of his right to print antislavery material in 1837.<br /><br />Furthermore Whites also raided to post offices and burnt all anti-slavery stuffs; the post director refused to accept the anti-slavery materials and congress ignored to mention the issue as well.<br /><br />Underground Railroad<br /><br />Fugitive slave law of 1850 which asserted for sending back the runaways from the state to state in addition of a new opportunity for white jobless called \\"slave catcher\\" was another violent measure facing the blacks.<br /><br />As a counter measure, Blacks developed a system called \\"Underground Railroad\\" or \\"Underground Railway\\" for transferring enslaved blacks to northern states and Canada to nonviolently free them.<br /><br />Using disguise and darkness 40,000 to 100,000 blacks liberated from white tyranny and of course not \\"white supremacy\\". Liberty Line introduced from 1830 was a brilliant hope for black peace sojourners, although it granted them Compromise of 1850 and Emancipation Proclamation (1863) by slave-holder Lincoln, which freed all slaves in the United States by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865. but violent Civil War had begun in 1861.<br /><br />Not being too late must another case be mentioned; Dred Scott a slave who sued for liberty after living in a non-slave state; caused the Supreme Court to declare the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional! A national compromise violently broke simply to not grant a black his liberty.<br /><br />Civil War<br /><br />Emancipation Proclamation was meant that the blacks as freedmen! could (must) attend the Union Army and defend of other freemen (whites). United States Colored Troops was established involved of 178,000 blacks.<br /><br />Out-Migrate vs. In-Migrate<br /><br />While for decades blacks for violently brought to Americas for servitude, after emancipation in fear of Blacks' retaliation whites thought to send back them to Africa.<br /><br />Liberia<br /><br />From 1817 a program called American Colonization Society emerged in Washington D.C with supports of local branches, churches, and the legislatures of Border States to transport freed and free-born blacks to Africa. The program was headed by Henry Clay and Francis Scott Key whom were from prominent slave holders. They bought a land on the western coast of Africa now called Liberia. Once forcibly in-migrated blacks then \\"peacefully\\" became out-migrated by whites and gained their freedom!<br /><br />Discrimination<br /><br />Although, if so in lip service blacks had been freed, but it was not encompassed the social rights such as right to vote and education. They were freed to be killed for defending of whites.<br /><br />It took a long more time to these rights found legitimacy. By the 15th amendment of American Constitution, Section 1, that reads: \\"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.\\" in 1870 Blacks found suffrage at last.<br /><br />But another odd occurrence took place, for the 1st time since and then the American President impeached, Andrew Johnson (1808-1875), 17th president of the United States (1865-1869) impeached accused of \\"violation of the Tenure of Office Act and the `command of the army' provisions of the Army Appropriations\\" and also another one which conveys that Johnson had attempted to undermine Congress. Save what aforesaid Johnson was pro-blacks and support them, so simply and violently he removed.<br /><br />Jim Crow<br /><br />The last quarter of 19th century was the time for another plot against Blacks. Jim Crow laws were discriminational written and un-written codes to prevent Black form accessing to public services like: parks, restaurants, hotels and etc. furthermore, Black veterans weren't in an equal status as whites were. \\"Persons of color\\" weren't called \\"negroes\\" but no inequality against them was common. This traditional violence against Blacks went further as a new club called Ku Klaus Klan emerged.<br /><br />Ku Klux Klan<br /><br />Post American Civil War a secret society of white Southerners in the United States was formed to resist the emancipation of slaves; they used terrorist tactics to suppress Black people. In fact they were White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASP) whom believed America belongs to whom are 100% American. They were against immigrants whether in terms of ethnicity or religion but their major animosity was for poor Blacks. There were two in the United States, one founded immediately after the Civil War and lasting until the 1870s, the other beginning in 1915 and continuing to the present and still act violently against Blacks.<br /><br />However, there were acts like Force Act in 1870 and the Ku Klux Act in 1871 which authorized the president to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, suppress disturbances by force, and impose heavy penalties upon terrorist organizations; but \\"white violence\\" could not tolerate it and in United States v. Harris in 1882, the Supreme Court declared the Ku Klux Act unconstitutional.<br /><br />W.E.B Dubois<br /><br />\\"Men of America, the problem is plain before you. Here is a race transplanted through the criminal foolishness of your fathers. Whether you like it or not the millions are here, and here they will remain. If you do not lift them up, they will pull you down.\\"<br />W. E. B. DuBois<br /><br />William Edward Burghardt DuBois was the United States civil rights leader and political activist who campaigned for equality for Black Americans, he was the first Afro-American received PhD degree. He was one of founders of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and it was synchronous with Harlem Renaissance. This was a time for blacks to fight against white's violence literarily. Of course, some black intellectuals were predecessors to them like Harriet Beecher Stowe with her \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\". Authors like Langston Hughes (belongs to Lost Generation) draw a vivid vision of Blacks' situation in America; as he versifies:<br /><br />I'm nobody, who are you?<br /><br />Are you nobody too?<br /><br />Then, there is a pair of us<br /><br />Don't tell you know<br /><br />They'll banish us<br /><br />How already to be somebody?<br /><br />Say your name all day long<br /><br />Like a frog in the bog.<br /><br />W.E.B. DuBois's doctoral dissertation was The Suppression of the African Slave-Trade to the United States of America, 1638-1870. As the editor of The Crisis, he encouraged the development of black literature and art and urged his readers to see \\"Beauty in Black.\\" In deed he and his contemporaries were the literate nonviolent campaigners against white's violence.<br /><br />Elijah Muhammad and Nation of Islam<br /><br />\\"The Negro wants to be everything but himself...He wants to integrate with the white man, but he cannot integrate with himself or with his own kind. The Negro wants to lose his identity because he does not know his own identity.\\"<br />Elijah Muhammad<br />Elijah Poole converted to Islam as Elijah Muhammad was founder and leader of the black separatist religious movement known as the Nation of Islam (sometimes called Black Muslims) in the United States. He was famous for his rhetoric directed at white people, whom he called \\"blue-eyed devils.\\" He challenged white's violence by articulating Islam rulings in Black Americans context and promoted racial unity and self-help and maintained a strict code of discipline among members. During World War II he asked his followers not to attend military service and serve for white's devil whimsical desire. He was jailed for his thoughts and speeches, but being imprisoned he was challenging with white's violence and try to find others to convert them to Islam and enter them to the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X was one of them.<br /><br />Malcolm X and Black Power<br /><br />\\"There is nothing in our book, The Koran, that teaches us to suffer peacefully. Our religion teaches us to be intelligent. Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone, but, if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery. That's a good religion.\\"<br />Malcolm X<br /><br />Malcolm Little well known as Malcolm X was a black militant leader who articulated concepts of race pride and Black Nationalism in the early 1960s. Primarily he was not a Muslim, but he converted to Islam and became a minister of the Nation of Islam movement being familiar with Elijah Muhammad. He was an exception in this narrative as he believed in violence rather than violence, in deed it's his belief: \\"I'm nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me.\\" Whites were violent to him so he was to them as well. This is was the bone of a little contention between him and MLK.<br /><br />Back Power who were movement formed by American blacks to produce social equality and equal rights and emphasize racial pride; and Black Panthers who were radical underground African American organization that was founded by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale in the mid-1960s and advocated violence to attain liberation and equality for African Americans were largely influenced by his opinions. They were standing for violent campaign in facing of white's violence and mostly Ku Klux Klan. For this belief he sentenced years of his life in prison and actually there he met Elijah Muhammad.<br /><br />However, after he came back from Hajj pilgrimage and rename himself as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz, chose a more nonviolent way in his struggle against white's violence. That's why he was assassinated in 1965 by some which there is belief they were Blacks related to Nation of Islam!<br /><br />Thurgood Marshall and Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka<br /><br />\\"The United States has been called the melting pot of the world. But it seems to me that the colored man either missed getting into the pot or he got melted down.\\"<br /><br />Thurgood Marshall<br /><br />Thurgood Marshall was the first black member of the U.S. Supreme Court. As an attorney he successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954), in which racial segregation in American public schools was declared unconstitutional. He's prominent in advancing anti discriminational laws in US judiciary system. His legacy up to now is what Black community benefits form. Before his legacy white's violence even militarily prevented Black students to entering White's school, after it they become motley.<br /><br />Martin Luther King Jr. and Civil Rights Movements<br /><br />\\"Today the choice is no longer between violence and nonviolence.<br /><br />It is either nonviolence or nonexistence.\\"<br /><br />MLK<br /><br />The most famous figure in American Black Community is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. doubtless. He is an American emblem of Nonviolence. King's nonviolent doctrine was strongly influenced by the teachings of Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi. Unlike the great majority of civil rights activists who have regarded nonviolence as a convenient tactic. King followed Gandhi's principles of pacifism. In King's view, civil rights demonstrators, who were beaten and jailed by hostile whites, through the redemptive character of their unmerited suffering educated and transformed their oppressors. King set about organizing the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which gave him a base of operation throughout the South, as well as a national platform from which to speak<br /><br />The Montgomery bus boycott started on December 1, 1955, when Rosa Parks, an African American woman, refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger, and as a consequence was arrested for violating the city's segregation law. It was an ignition for chain of nonviolent protests against segregation and racial discrimination. Sit-Ins in Nashville under leadership of James Lawson, nonviolent demonstrations and public speech were usual tactics rendered by Blacks (mostly students) to confront Whites brutality and violence.<br /><br />King joined other civil rights leaders in organizing the historic March on Washington. On August 28, 1963, an interracial assembly of more than 200,000 gathered peaceably in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial to demand equal justice for all citizens under the law. It led to Civil Rights Act in coming year.<br /><br />But these accomplishments were not as easy as ABC; once MLK had said: \\"I'm frankly tired of marching. I'm tired of going to jail,\\" for every minute reason he had been sued by whites. In 1968 days before living for Memphis he'd asserted: \\"Living every day under the threat of death, I feel discouraged every now and then and feel my work's in vain, but then the Holy Spirit revives my soul again.\\" He was accurate, on April 4, 1968 he was shot in a Balcony of a hotel in Memphis by a violent white some like to call him James Earl Ray. He sentenced for a century a year after but even Dr. King's family doesn't believe in him as the assassinator.<br /><br />If so King chose nonviolence and not nonexistence; but \\"White violence\\" chose nonexistence for him, even by announcing his birthday as a holyday.<br /><br />Louise Farrakhan<br /><br />After Muhammad's death in 1975 another group, retaining both the name and the founding principles of Elijah Muhammad's original Nation of Islam, was established under the leadership of Louis Eugene Wolcott converted to Islam with a new name Louis Farrakhan. He was leader of the New York Temple and the Nation' most prominent spokesman at the time of Elijah Muhammad' death. Although given a national post by Mohammed, Farrakhan disagreed with Mohammed' changes, and in 1978 he left to found a third Nation of Islam.<br /><br />By the 1990s he had emerged as a prominent African American leader, as demonstrated by the success in 1995 of the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., which he helped to organize. In 1995 Qubilah Shabazz daughter of Malcolm X was accused of plot to assassinate him, but he didn't sue the case. Farrakhan toned down his racial rhetoric and moved the group toward orthodox Islam after a bout with prostate cancer in 2000.<br /><br />COINTELPRO<br /><br />During the 1950s and '60s, the bureau used covert means to disrupt the activities of groups it considered subversive and to discredit their leaders; the operations, known as COINTELPRO (counterintelligence programs), were officially discontinued in 1971.<br /><br />John Edgar Hoover, ex FBI director who was 48 years at office, clarifies the mission of COINTELPRO against nationalist blacks as below:<br /><br />a. preventing form emergence of a new leader who can unify Blacks.<br /><br />b. preventing from violence directed by Black nationalist groups<br /><br />c. preventing from popularizing of Black Nationalist groups and their leaders<br /><br />d. preventing from rapid growth of Black Nationalist Organizations especially among youth.<br /><br />e. targets of these operation were: Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad and ... .<br /><br />Hoover also ordered aggressive surveillance of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and tried to discredit King by disseminating derogatory information about him to the media, Congress, and others.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />It's 2008, to a high extend Blacks and Whites have been melted, even a Black man have nominated himself for American Presidency; but still there is Ku Klux Klan (if so, underground); WASPs are still the superiors amongst nation; guys show \\"noose\\" to their Black friends and foes even jokingly and white's violence is still common.<br /><br />Individualism is a white phenomenon in American mind as volunteerism is; in fact as George Orwell says in Animal Farm: \\"all are equal but some are more equal\\" and this is the true meaning of egalitarianism and Human Rights in the States. America is a melting pot, but blacks never considered as edible and thus prevented to enter the pot.<br /><br />Prologue<br /><br />African Slaves were the first Blacks whom had brought to the \\"New World\\" in 1619 and it was just 12 years passing from settlement of James Town. They weren't aggressive, but aggression was upon them. If so poor, but human at least were they in their motherland; but apocryphal white gods forging ahead enslave them. Promising peace and piety sent them to hell where apostasy from their fathers' belief was mandatory.<br /><br />Violence violence and a little more violence was their wage from working in their unwanted servitude in charge of others' malefactor. So gradually the common color of \\"good\\" became evil and the color of \\"evil\\" changed for innocence, a world full of Black and White.<br /><br />As time passed the so called \\"slaves\\" start to ask for their human dignity and that was a totally new phase for violent response from the \\"masters\\". Black takes a long time to fade as their hope; they hadn't been giving up and reach to what they struggle for, as once Martin Luther King Jr. said: \\"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last\\"<br /><br />Introduction<br /><br />Various dissatisfactions may result in protests in a community or a society. Religious, economical, societal and political concerns are amongst the most important factors which provoke different groups and classes to counter act against the status quo. In most of the time such displeasures end in some political gained grants, trivial or general reformations in current law and mechanism and compromise and returning to pre-challenge era. But in some occasions the depth and level of discontent is in its extreme thus the protestors are looking for a fundamental reformation or in other words revolution and subversion. Overthrow can be done by civilians or servicemen, in societal level such a protest is known as a movement. In deed, social movements are acts and processes in which some (most of time minorities but certainly not always) seek their own wills.<br /><br />From one aspect movements can be divided to violent and nonviolent. Many of social movements are peaceful at start, but different events may lead them to violence; and off course in some cases their first intended shifts to a major one and may be revolution. Reading history since 19th century shows that such procedures in China, Russia, France, Czechoslovakia, Iran and etc had been caused to revolution and regime change.<br /><br />In China peasants were against high tax which they were obliged to pay to Emperor, but the mismanagement and not tolerating of their claim, led to emerging of Marxist beliefs and Chinese masses movement led by Mao Tse-tung who was a communist teacher. Some campaigns caused to ousting the last emperor of the Qing dynasty and establishing the People's Republic of China.<br /><br />In Russia the workers were against their low wages, but the Emperor's police violently killed 5 of them, and that was the beginning of toppling Romanov's Empire. 1917 February was the time to say good bye to Kremlin, just in 8 months form then the first communist government announced by Bolsheviks led by Lenin.<br /><br />In France people had some criticisms on Empire, but neglecting their demands and treating with them brutality, expanding the bourgeoisie in state convince the people for democracy rather than dictatorship. If so this regime change took a 10 year struggle but at last people got what they want.<br /><br />In Czechoslovakia as well harsh communist environment, encouraged people for a Reform, which off course soon changed to a movement for Velvet Revolution (which was coin thereafter for revolutions with reformative apparatuses). That was the beginning of so called Color Revolutions, nonviolent regime changes in ex-soviet states.<br /><br />In Iran off course the main demand was on religion rather than economy, but people chose to have theological based democracy rather than living under Pahlavi's dictatorship. So they decide to change and thus drove out the 2500 years kingdom in Iran and replaced a democratic Republic government.<br /><br />As it's obvious form previous lines most of social movements which had been enlarged to a national extend changed to a revolutionary movements, but in America there is an exceptional case.<br /><br />Social movements in America which had been known from 1960s have a longer history; it dates back to the first days of American Revolution.

Farrakhan toned down his racial rhetoric and moved the group toward orthodox Islam after a bout with prostate cancer in 2000.<br /><br />COINTELPRO<br /><br />During the 1950s and '60s, the bureau used covert means to disrupt the activities of groups it considered subversive and to discredit their leaders; the operations, known as COINTELPRO (counterintelligence programs), were officially discontinued in 1971.<br /><br />John Edgar Hoover, ex FBI director who was 48 years at office, clarifies the mission of COINTELPRO against nationalist blacks as below:<br /><br />a. preventing form emergence of a new leader who can unify Blacks.<br /><br />b. preventing from violence directed by Black nationalist groups<br /><br />c. preventing from popularizing of Black Nationalist groups and their leaders<br /><br />d. preventing from rapid growth of Black Nationalist Organizations especially among youth.<br /><br />e. targets of these operation were: Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad and ... .<br /><br />Hoover also ordered aggressive surveillance of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and tried to discredit King by disseminating derogatory information about him to the media, Congress, and others.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />It's 2008, to a high extend Blacks and Whites have been melted, even a Black man have nominated himself for American Presidency; but still there is Ku Klux Klan (if so, underground); WASPs are still the superiors amongst nation; guys show \\"noose\\" to their Black friends and foes even jokingly and white's violence is still common.<br /><br />Individualism is a white phenomenon in American mind as volunteerism is; in fact as George Orwell says in Animal Farm: \\"all are equal but some are more equal\\" and this is the true meaning of egalitarianism and Human Rights in the States. America is a melting pot, but blacks never considered as edible and thus prevented to enter the pot.<br /><br />Prologue<br /><br />African Slaves were the first Blacks whom had brought to the \\"New World\\" in 1619 and it was just 12 years passing from settlement of James Town. They weren't aggressive, but aggression was upon them. If so poor, but human at least were they in their motherland; but apocryphal white gods forging ahead enslave them. Promising peace and piety sent them to hell where apostasy from their fathers' belief was mandatory.<br /><br />Violence violence and a little more violence was their wage from working in their unwanted servitude in charge of others' malefactor. So gradually the common color of \\"good\\" became evil and the color of \\"evil\\" changed for innocence, a world full of Black and White.<br /><br />As time passed the so called \\"slaves\\" start to ask for their human dignity and that was a totally new phase for violent response fromthe \\"masters\\". Black takes a long time to fade as their hope; they hadn't been giving up and reach to what they struggle for, as once Martin Luther King Jr. said: \\"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last\\"<br /><br />Introduction<br /><br />Various dissatisfactions may result in protests in a community or a society. Religious, economical, societal and political concerns are amongst the most important factors which provoke different groups and classes to counter act against the status quo. In most of the time such displeasures end in some political gained grants, trivial or general reformations in current law and mechanism and compromise and returning to pre-challenge era. But in some occasions the depth and level of discontent is in its extreme thus the protestors are looking for a fundamental reformation or in other words revolution and subversion. Overthrow can be done by civilians or servicemen, in societal level such a protest is known as a movement. In deed, social movements are acts and processes in which some (most of time minorities but certainly not always) seek their own wills.<br /><br />From one aspect movements can be divided to violent and nonviolent. Many of social movements are peaceful at start, but different events may lead them to violence; and off course in some cases their first intended shifts to a major one and may be revolution. Reading history since 19th century shows that such procedures in China, Russia, France, Czechoslovakia, Iran and etc had been caused to revolution and regime change.<br /><br />In China peasants were against high tax which they were obliged to pay to Emperor, but the mismanagement and not tolerating of their claim, led to emerging of Marxist beliefs and Chinese masses movement led by Mao Tse-tung who was a communist teacher. Some campaigns caused to ousting the last emperor of the Qing dynasty and establishing the People's Republic of China.<br /><br />In Russia the workers were against their low wages, but the Emperor's police violently killed 5 of them, and that was the beginning of toppling Romanov's Empire. 1917 February was the time to say good bye to Kremlin, just in 8 months form then the first communist government announced by Bolsheviks led by Lenin.<br /><br />In France people had some criticisms on Empire, but neglecting their demands and treating with them brutality, expanding the bourgeoisie in state convince the people for democracy rather than dictatorship. If so this regime change took a 10 year struggle but at last people got what they want.<br /><br />In Czechoslovakia as well harsh communist environment, encouraged people for a Reform, which off course soon changed to a movement for Velvet Revolution (which was coin thereafter for revolutions with reformative apparatuses). That was the beginning of so called Color Revolutions, nonviolent regime changes in ex-soviet states.<br /><br />In Iran off course the main demand was on religion rather than economy, but people chose to have theological based democracy rather than living under Pahlavi's dictatorship. So they decide to change and thus drove out the 2500 years kingdom in Iran and replaced a democratic Republic government.<br /><br />As it's obvious form previous lines most of social movements which had been enlarged to a national extend changed to a revolutionary movements, but in America there is an exceptional case.<br /><br />Social movements in America which had been known from 1960s have a longer history; it dates back to the first days of American Revolution. Since then various and different actions, rebellions and movements flourished and diminished. Each of these events had led to a reform even a minor one.<br /><br />So interesting it is that despite of numerous opponent beliefs and opinions none of them were looked for revolution. All Americans believe in America as a benevolent Empire, which have been bestowed them their rights and may be it can be called \\"democratic empire\\", which is a self contrary term as Empire and Republic are binary opposites.<br /><br />Blacks' movement in 1960s in spite of all Ku Klux Klan violent actions against them was nonviolently supporters of America as well. Off course in a short period Black Power shifted to violence under leadership of intellectuals like Malcolm X, but still was supporter and fan of America.<br /><br />Women', Students' and Indians' movements have been supporters of America too. This is the exceptional identity of American social movements which despite of all different heterogeneous bona fide beliefs the overall activists are unanimously supporters of status quo and by that I mean America.<br /><br />Entering of Blacks into the American Scene<br /><br />\\"Violence is as American as cherry pie.\\"<br /><br />H. Rap Brown (1943 - )<br /><br />Africans entered into the \\"West Indies\\" a short after Europeans did. At first they weren't \\"slaves\\" but servants whom could buy their freedom; but as days were gone more need for worker was felt, thus the servants enslaved and that's all. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, an estimated total of 12 million Africans were forcibly transported to the Americas.<br /><br />Slavery<br /><br />The new discovered land seemed to be a \\"promised land\\" full of fertile lands, but much land were there, fewer men were present. Whites started to bring Blacks to there, primarily with consent and kindness and step by step interchanged their manner to kidnapping. Blacks were to be farmers or farmhands, but became indentured servants whom were enlisted to be free for more than 3 centuries.<br /><br />Southern colonies was a paradise of cotton and West Indies Company as well as its eastern half was responsible for preparing demanded cotton for English textile companies. It's obvious that anybody is looking for cheaper production and so more benefit. They put at work the new black comers, low wage and high gage servants who could made money far more than their own cost.<br /><br />Slavery is obscure in American Constitution, if so some hints verify it within. The Founding Fathers with no exception were slave holders. They established laws to have blacks as their property, and an obligation to send back \\"runaways\\" to their masters. Huge and vast lands really required man power to be cultivated.<br /><br />Too many discourses and dialogues were common about the inimical nature of this phenomenon but it was commonly widespread in southern states. But Eli Whitney invented a machine for prolonging the debate on abolitionism.<br /><br />If so Missouri Compromise succeeded to some extend in banning of slavery extension but it was an ignition for the American Civil Wars. 450,000 to 483,000 casualties -save economical and emotional losses- is just the Human cost of this simple statement: to have or not to have slaves, that's the question. From 1861 to 1865 Americans \\"spoke daggers\\" to each other to understood whether they should remain masters or simply became neighbors.<br /><br />Abolitionism<br /><br />The keystones of anti slavery dates back to 1783 but the organized steps towards it began years after it. Under the leadership of William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, anti slavery campaigners succeeded in getting the slave trade to the British colonies abolished in 1807. The United States prohibited the importation of slaves that same year, though widespread smuggling continued until about 1862.<br /><br />\\"Liberator\\" read and asked for emancipation and liberation of slaves from the starting hours of 1831 frankly, if so it took 32 years for this claim to be verified. Torture was what had been done upon poor slaves, thus those religious orthodox men whom were unable to have slaves financially or there was no need

B00687XO1G|5.0|As usual I want to start with a complain against Amazon for lumping all product reviews of a film regardless of which edition under one heading (and allowing those idiots with customer service issues to post 'product reviews' bemoaning their mis-treatment at the hands of faceless capitalism).<br /><br />This review is of the Criterion Blu Ray Edition ONLY.<br /><br />Some aspects of the film are a bit dated; but all in all is is a classic resorted to beautiful condition! The picture is sharp and clear, the great Duke Ellington sound track (and live performance!) is terrific. What a treat to see this much like I remember it.<br /><br />This is probably one of Preminger's best films. There are no big action scenes at all, but the sparing of a mature James Stewart and (a very young) George C. Scott are amazing to watch. I had forgotten how good this film was and I'm very happy with it.

B001CDLATE|1.0|BUYER BEWARE: If you are looking for entertainment look elsewhere. This is social commentary not entertainment! It gets an A+ for technical excellence and an F for content. I should have known that a Ron Frikie film would be awful just look at Chronos if you want another example of hideous taste melded with high resolution & a big budget.<br /><br />This \\"film\\" is a rich mixture of aberrant human behavior contrasted with blissful tranquility of a baboon in a hot tub. (Not too hard to read between those lines.) Be aware that in some countries showing the genitals of pre-pubescent African females is considered child pornography. This blu ray version will take you from the bizarre all male primitive rituals in some stone age culture to the mind numbing frenetic repetitiveness of a sped up modern assembly lines and Manhattan traffic that goes on and on and on... For those of you who are pan pipe lovers you will get your recommended lifetime dose plus some. A classic example that taste has nothing to do with budget.<br /><br />Save your money, buy something worthwhile. This copy is going back for some other sucker to buy.

0525478817|5.0|Title: The Fault in Our Stars<br />Author: John Green<br />Publisher: Dutton Juvenile<br />Publication Date: January 10, 2012<br />Source: The Library<br /><br />Genre: A Cancer YA Contemporary Romance that isn't a cancer story (i.e. isn't just about the main characters having cancer). Hint: DON'T shy away from this because of the cancer element. I almost did, and that would have been a HUGE mistake.<br /><br />Cover: It's okay. I wasn't as impressed with it at first, but I can't really think of anything that would work better--> and so by that reasoning, it's successful. I like the color choices.<br /><br />Plot: It may feel oh-so-slightly slow moving at the beginning, but it's necessary, and the payoff is worth it. This book is kind of amazing, and it is definitely awesome possum. The trouble with reviewing it? I don't want to give anything away. I'm not going to rob you of its greatness. Just know, it really starts to move, and you get super invested in the characters, whether or not you realize it.<br /><br />Romantic Element: LOVE. I am officially fictionally in love with Augustus Waters. Note: I didn't even have to Google his last name. I knew it. Why? Because I. Am. In. Love. How often have you heard me say that here? Not very, that's for true.<br /><br />Overall: Genius. Love. Hearts and hearts and hearts. I made people read it so that I could talk to them about it. I reacted like I haven't reacted to a book in my recollection. I didn't think I was a John Green reader. I had tried and failed to read his stuff before (not his fault. circumstances outside of my control usually---like due dates), but this one stuck, and I am SO glad it did.<br /><br />*Review courtesy of [...]
B001GA1RFA|4.0|The hero of this refreshing coming of age story is Colin, a nerdy kid with a sky-high IQ who has dated 19 girls called Katherine and been dumped by all of them. Actually, it's really 18 -- because Katherine number one, who was his girlfriend for two minutes when they were eight, turns out also to be Katherine number 19.<br /><br />With his friend Hassan, an amiable fat kid who is nominally Muslim, Colin sets out on a road trip from Chicago to recover from his wounds. Somewhere in Tennessee, they see a sign inviting them to visit the grave of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination in Sarajevo set off World War One.<br /><br />The tour guide for the alleged tomb is an appealing girl their own age called Lindsey Lee and the meeting sets off a new set of adventures. The two are invited by Lindsey's mother, Hollis, to stay the summer and help compile an oral history of the town of Gutshot, TN, and especially the cotton factory Hollis runs which has been reduced to producing tampon strings.<br /><br />Colin, who loves making anagrams, reads voraciously and has \\"a piece missing\\" when it comes to relationships, seems to be somewhere on the Autism spectrum -- although the author never uses that word. He is obsessed by constructing a mathematical formula that will explain how relationships unfold and who will dump whom (a mathematician friend of the author provides a helpful essay at the end of the book to explain how the formula works).<br /><br />Colin and Lindsey have an obvious attraction but Lindsey already has a boyfriend, a muscle-bound jock also called Colin. How will all this resolve?<br /><br />I must say I liked this book. It was witty and also got into some of the heartbreaks of growing up and trying to figure out an identity. My one problem is that I did not believe fully in the protagonist. I did not believe that a kid as geeky as this one, with the kind of difficulties he has interacting with people, would have had 19 different girlfriends -- it just would not have happened. And for someone as socially awkward as he is supposed to be, he was quite assured with Lindsey when the time came.<br /><br />But part of reading fiction is suspending disbelief, and I was able to do this well enough to enjoy the book.would not have happened.

B0018QQQK8|4.0|This is another enjoyable to read Nicholas Sparks book.  Development of characters builds throughout the storyline, flashbacks are well written, find yourself pulling for Logan & Elizabeth to have their relationship succeed.<br />  With well definded characters you find yourself pulled into the story line.  This story can make one ponder the concept of \\"destiny\\" & this is demonstrated throughout the story.<br />  Would recommend this story & looking forward to reading my next Nicholas Sparks kindle book - the decision is . . . which one?!!!

B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This is an excellent album. There isn't much variety in the tracks (girl falls for bad guy and gets hurt--over and over again), but poets are hysterical and repeat messages over and over again to stress a point. Lana is not a poet, but she comes close to it as a marvelous songwriter. Personally, I enjoy this album very much, and I would recommend it to anyone even slightly interested.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Ash Maurya's book Running Lean presents a non-nonsense, framework for getting a startup off the ground without burning loads of capital. As much as it is possible to have a template for startups, it at least makes you think about what you should be thinking about when going from idea to operational venture. The book and ideas within stand on the shoulders of giants in the field such as Eric Ries (Lean Startup) and Steve Blank (The Four Steps to Epiphany). The Lean Canvas framework is introduced early on and this is for me one of the most useful techniques introduced to help with the evolution of idea to venture.

The Android Market's PvZ supports qHD and the iOS has so much more content..<br /><br />I have already passed this game not only once, but twice now since it was released as an app  for Android. I eventually grew bored of it because there was nothing else to do or collect..<br /><br />I wish they could put the Zen Garden, more achievements, and more content like iOS's version. Until then this app is a 3 star for me.

B004XNPQUO|1.0|Per the description that states sticky (unsecure broadcast) intents are required for Air, is the developer implying one must download the huge-sized Adobe Air onto their devices in order to play this game? If so, it should state that clearly as well and not disguise that requirement in an \\"explanation\\" why they \\"had to\\" include stickies as a permission.  I believe we've already covered discussions of what sticky intents are in reviews of other apps. If you're unsure of what they are and what they do, search for those discussions in reviews of other recent apps. Basically, stickies are an UNSECURE way of broadcasting data over an internet connection, which this app ALSO wants your permission for.<br /><br />Sticky intents being unsecure, making data available to other apps that may not have a need for that information, as well as the disguised mention of possibly necessitating the download of Adobe Air for this to even run, make this app a bloated risky one that I cannot recommend. The Air issue aside, stickie intents alone make this app something you should never download, and many concerned developers don't even want to include it for that reason. Stay safe out there, people!

1449305172|5.0|I've read several books in this field, The Lean Startup, Making Ideas Happen, The Art of Start, and Running Lean is always the first book I recommend to any entrepreneur.  It's that great of a book.<br /><br />What makes this book standout is that there's great intellectual depth behind the concepts and ideas Ash presents but written in a clear, practical manner that makes it easy to follow. If you're debating between Running Lean or The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, definitely start with Ash's first.  Here's an example why - Eric advocates doing customer discovery, i.e. talking with customers, and discusses the benefits of doing so.  Ash does that and goes further by giving you the actual tactics on how to do so.  Where to find those potential customers, how to reach out to them, and even a template of the questions to ask them.  That's the beauty of his book, it goes beyond the \\"why\\" and gives you the specific hows to execute.<br /><br />The other big benefit of this book is the structure of the content as it's a linear storyline.  There's a quick overview, and then Ash starts going from an idea to validating it incrementally into a successful, product that's structured for growth. So you only need to read up to the point your venture is at.  That itself follows the idea within the book of \\"Right Action, Right Time\\" which puts more of your time taking your venture to the next stage.<br /><br />This is a 5 star book and worth every penny.
B004XNPQUO|5.0|This app is a refreshing twist on the typical shooter games. Definitely makes you think before you pull the trigger. Definitely worth the download.<br />And for all those stressed out by the FAOTD trolls that complain about something that is being given to them for free, relax and get used to it. People like this have been around for centuries and will be around for centuries to come. Heywood was the first to write about them back in 1562, and obviously not the last, &quot; Beggers should be no choosers, but yet they will:&quot;. So relax and enjoy the great games Amazon is providing for free and let the trolls whine and complain as they will.. it's what they do.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|In its depth, a kind of \\"2001\\" for the 21st century. No, it can't beat Kubrick's 1968 \\"Get Your Ticket To That Wheel In Space While There's Time\\" masterwork, but it's a rarity in current SF films as it doesn't pound you into the floor with 120 dB soundtrack and over-the-top CG. It actually makes you think. The Blu-Ray renders the lunar imagery as I could imagine -- crisp, stark, bright, empty. Rockwell's a fabulous actor, too! A must for serious science fiction collectors.
0545425115|5.0|this was the best book i have ever read. I am so in love with it - i could barely put it down and looked forward to reading it.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Why did Amazon prefix this review with that \\"Are you over 13?\\" question? Rango COULD be for kids but its humor is very grown-up, and, unlike FAR too many animated films, NOT stuffed with overused cutesy cultural references. I took my sister -- recovering from foot surgery -- last year; if laughter is the best medicine, \\"Rango\\" is a mega-pharmacy. Intelligent, beautifully rendered, it should have taken best FILM, period.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I own the Kindle edition and I think it's great. The price is OK, especially if I take into account that I got the 4 books for the same price that I could bought just one of them in my country. Regarding the story, I love it. It's very addictive. George R. R. Martin gives you huge surprises in every book. It's amazing!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I originally stumbled across Wool I read many reviews in an effort to gauge whether or not I'd be putting my money towards a good sci-fi read. As it turns out, Wool is more than a good sci-fi read; Wool is a great  read, period. It has a well paced story arc with a satisfying conclusion, also leaving plenty of room for more stories in the universe. Its characters are believable and superbly designed to be loved, hated, and pitied. The science is quite solid, and most importantly of all the mysteries are deep and intriguing.<br /><br />As the kind of reader who appreciates all these elements in fiction, but definitely has some personal favorites, that last part made me very happy with my purchase. If you're sitting on the fence about giving this book a shot, grab the sampler like I did and see for yourself. I'm quite certain most people will end up reading the sampler to its finish and immediately buying Wool, just like me.
B004XNPQUO|4.0|This is a nice little shoot-the-enemy-in-space game only with a twist. Instead of randomly firing haphazardly at oncoming enemy spaceships or asteroids,  this game requires you to strategically direct &amp; aim your weapon in such a way that you're specifically targeting your enemy. I like the fact that it makes me need to actually think.<br />There is a good tuturial mode, making the game easy to learn &amp; understand before moving on to the more advanced levels. I always appreciate a game app that does this.<br />The graphics are simple, colorful &amp; large enough to clearly see on the Kindle's 7&quot; inch screen.<br />There's an option to turn game sounds off &amp; there is no background music but, after concentrating on a couple levels, this wasn't even missed.

1609611543|4.0|3-2-12 (Initial) - This is my first day in giving up wheat. My daughter and I have decided to try this for one month.  She is 15 yrs. old and have put on some weight in the last few years and I am 48 yrs, old and am at my heaviest weight ever (234)! I am a type I diabetic and I feel tired all of the time.  I received in the mail this week a packet with information on the Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight... and thought it was very interesting so I put the pre-paid postcard in the mail for the book and the three free gifts. I then went on the internet to find out more about the book. I read the reviews and decided to get started immediately. We went into the kitchen and bagged up all of the \\"stuff\\" that contained wheat...wow it was a lot! I am excited in seeing the effects of giving up wheat and will update this review on a weekly basis.

Our protagonist displays a little too much Austenesque plot mandated dimwittery toward the end, but she'd been so good until then, and we were so close to the finish, that I gave her a bye.<br />I'm not usually keen on the Oprah's List books, and I suspect that this could easily be included on such a list, so I was a little surprised to be as terribly fond of it as I am. But I am.
B00632HWOG|1.0|First of all this app is very user friendly.  However, the problem I have with this app is that there is no option to sign out.  This creates many security concerns.  Since the Kindle Fire can be used in wireless networks, once you are logged into a network the Fire can be can be accessed by people that may try to hack passwords.  Since I would only use the Yahoo Mail app when traveling to check my personal e-mails, I believe that this app MUST have an option to log out.  Once you log in, you are on the service at all times.  You would have to turn off the wireless access in order to prevent hackers from finding your e-mail password.  Once I realized that you could not log out of Yahoo Mail I removed the app from my Fire.  If they improve the app and allow a log out feature I may consider this app in the future.

1594203334|4.0|After reading the alternately glowing and disparaging reviews of this book in various newspapers and in the blogosphere I really wasn't sure what to expect from this book: an interesting study of cultural difference, a how-to manual, a mad bashing of American motherhood?  I'm pleased to report Bringing Up Bebe is decidedly NOT an attack on American mothers.  What it does offer is a well-written examination of both the intriguingly excellent qualities of the \\"French way\\" of parenting (which, quite frankly, didn't seem all that alien, merely more \\"old school\\"--it reflected my personal upbringing in many ways) along with the things that gave the author pause.  The author is certainly not a straightforward \\"convert\\" or evangelist for the \\"French way.\\"  She carefully parses the differences, both in terms of action and philosophy, between the French and American way of parenting, weighing the fears, hopes, cultural influences and expectations informing each approach.  Ultimately, in sketching out the differences, the author indicates that, by and large, both French and American parents desire the same things: happy, intellectually \\"alive\\" children (who sleep through the night!), and a degree of sanity for themselves (the parents).  How to arrive at these goals?  Here's what's got certain American mothers up in arms in the online \\"comments\\" sections.  But after reading the book, I'm somewhat puzzled over this response.  The author of Bringing Up Bebe isn't recommending many of the things these commentators are claiming (including that parents ought to ignore their kids, stifle them with arbitrary rules and force them to act unnaturally).  Nowhere in the book does the author indicate French children are ignored (quite the contrary--the author claims French parents are careful listeners and observers of their children) or unloved (is it really loving to indulge childrens' every whim?) or forced, for arbitrary reasons, to act unnaturally.  Rather the author reminds readers ofthings most people agree on: that, generally speaking, the happiest, healthiest individuals are those who experience and know how to deal with both structure and freedom, with both common courtesy (social rules) and personal interests and desires.  Negotiating between these positions is part of what being a member of any society is about (its important to note that the French view their children as a part of the social fabric, NOT as some American parents do: as some sort of not-yet-fully-human creature that, due to this status, has no role in or obligations to the world in which he or she is living).  At its best, what the book does do is offer drowning parents hope--a lifeline, if you will.  It speaks against the guilt and fear-mongering which is at the heart of the messages about parenting in America.  It assures harried mothers that taking a night off here or there to \\"be an adult\\" will not damage their children.  (It might even help them be better parents--staving off depression).  It offers truly helpful advice in terms of things like eating habits (children really can learn to like veggies!--french fries are a choice, not inevitable) which speaks to the very real problem of childhood obesity which plagues our nation.  In any case, however you think you feel about the French or the topics the author raises in this book, its worth reading with an open mind.  Who knows, maybe it will be helpful.  And even if it's not, it's an entertaining read.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are cute, and I like the concept of earning points to unlock games. the controls aren't the best but the game was free. sometimes I find myself not being able to put it down til I beat the game I'm on. :)

B006UKFFE0|5.0|This is a practical how-to step-by-step guide for entrepreneurs looking to start businesses and reduce the risk of most startups failing.  Ash is a genius when it comes to synthesizing information from various sources (e.g. Dave McClure's Pirate Metrics, Jason Cohen's Unfair Advantage, and his own Lean Canvas take on Alex Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas).  I've recommended this book to quite a few people, and one of my angel investments (Forecast) uses this book to guide their startup.  Ash contributes to the community by holding monthly meetups for Lean Startup practitioners in Austin and he interacts regularly with entrepreneurs in the real-world via 30-minute \\"office-hours\\"-like talk sessions.  Many of the concepts in this book were derived from practical real-world scenarios such as these.  I highly recommend this book and continue to do so to entrepreneurs I meet on a regular basis.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have this game, Bakery Story & Farm Story. All are so much fun to play! Many boo-hoo these games because they think u have to spend real money on gems to play, this is not true. You get 2 gems for each recipe you master and for each crop/tree (in Farm Story) you master! There are 4 levels to each recipe, so you get a gem when you get to level 2 and then again at level 4. So 2 gems per recipe. So if there is somethimg that cost gems & u wanna buy it, then save your gems till u have enough! Once you fiqure out the game it is a lot of fun! Also to prevent your food from being eaten up fast while ur getting the hang of it put a table or chair in front of the door, this will prevent customers from coming in. Doing this helps build ur food up so it will last longer! And if you have children playing any of the TeamLava games, you can prevent them from purchasing gems w/ real money by setting PARENTAL CONTROL, by going in the game and going to the menu/help section. It will explain how you can put a password in to block purchases!!!!!! Great games, love them on my Kindle Fire!
B004ZNARH4|1.0|Not only is this box a sort of cool, but not a cool as previous boxes, but the price should have demanded more. In the bottom of the box are four stick on posts to hold the bare discs in. Of course, all four disc are floating around in the box covered in scratches, GOUGES, and a gummy glue substance--no doubt form the two holding posts that were also floating arounds the box.  As a record collector of 40 years I am horrified. The only worse product I have seen in a while is The Wall Immersion box which was almost twice the price and even less impressive.  Beware.
B000GIXLO8|5.0|Very pleased with my purchase of The Two Towers extended edition. I can't get over how many important details were revealed in this edtion. I really thought the Ent's battle with Saruman at Isengard was awesome,along with the burial scene in Rohan of Theodon's son and what happened to the retreating orcs at the battle of Helms deep. I could spend all day going over every detail but I think you get my point. i just finshed reading the LOTR's and I think the film version of The Two Towers in particular this extended edition was better than the literary version. A few years ago I was kinda ho hum about this trilogy but now I'm really a fan. I would say anyone interested in the LOTR'S should buy this edition.
B006IGZWB2|1.0|*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br /><br />I watched this movie and, for what it is worth, enjoyed it at the time. But upon further reflection, I think this movie is not very good.<br /><br />There are good moments in the movie, but then there are other moments that seem jarringly unrealistic. In another movie I wouldn't care. But in a film that at its core purports to accurately depict racism in the 50's / 60's, this starts to become a big problem for me later on.<br /><br />And yes, I know it is just a movie - not non-fiction. But with the amount of people touting this as an \\"important\\" or \\"life changing\\" movie, I think a bit of extra thinking is in order.<br /><br />One of the problems to me is that the main characters seem very shallow. Skeeter is the plucky young writer who is willing to face injustice, no matter the cost. Hilly is the EVIL racist who is set on destroying black people's lives. There's also an airhead blonde who serves little purpose in the movie, and a few bad mothers tossed in for fun. The black maids are all portrayed pretty similarly. They are all shown as good, honest people, many of whom raise and care for the babies of bad white mothers.<br /><br />Skeeter in particular seemed like a very unrealistic character. When the person who wrote the story makes the main character a writer, you know you are in for trouble. It comes off as self-indulgent as best. Mostly, it feels anachronistic. She's a liberal crusader for civil rights, and she arrived at this position how? From the maid being fired? I'm not buying it. Sure, there were some white people in Mississippi who cared about equal rights for blacks, but not many. And those who acted upon those beliefs were punished for it.<br /><br />And that brings me to another problem I have with Skeeter. She never suffers the true consequences of her actions. Never gets fired. Never receives death threats. Instead, she gets rewarded. She gets a nice cushy job in New York. The end of the movie sees her abandoningher black \\"friends\\" in Mississippi and heading off to a nice career for herself, never to have to worry about race-related matters again.<br /><br />What? You say her boyfriend dumped her for her beliefs? That was negative, right? Oh, puh-lease. That in no way compared to the kind of things that true civil rights advocates suffered. Losing a boyfriend would have been the least of her worries.<br /><br />That brings me to another thing I don't like in this movie - how it portrays men. The men are either non-existent, or fools. Buffoons or worse. Mostly, they just exist as props for the women in the story, who comprise the main characters. Nothing wrong with that, but I would have preferred for the movie to at least made some attempt to not show every man in it as a blockhead.<br /><br />The movie makes some attempt to avoid stereotypes and give the characters some depth, but still falls flat. I could not relate at all to most of the main characters. Maybe that's because I'm a guy, but I don't think so. It feels like weak writing.<br /><br />The writing went off the rails in a lot of scenes. One that stood out to me was when all the toilets were delivered to Hilly's front yard, and she has this big over-dramatic public meltdown. First, I find it hard to believe that people would dump that many toilets without at least knocking on the door. Second, I don't see a tough character like that bawling in public at all. But both events served the author of the story in her effort to make us feel that Evil Hilly got what she deserved.<br /><br />Speaking of Hilly... Bryce Dallas Howard stars, and man is she hot! God, what a babe. It's hard to believe she's related to Clint \\"Have some tranya\\" Howard. Dang, that guy looks like he was hit with the ugly stick. Okay, getting back on topic...<br /><br />There were a lot of things in this movie that didn't make sense to me. Like the whole deal on Constantine getting fired. I didn't understand why the black daughter wouldn't just goaround the back. Surely the white lady had entertained visitors before, hadn't she? And even if she hadn't, what's the big deal about being asked to go around back? And then when she does come in the front anyway, why is everyone so upset about it? It is viewed by the guests as an act of defiance, worthy of firing the black lady. To me, it just looks like a simple misunderstanding that the white lady would have easily explained and shrugged off. I'm supposed to believe that most white people back then were so racist that they never had any common sense at all? I don't know about that. The Constantine firing seems forced to me.<br /><br />And then later, we are told that Constantine has died, and Skeeter just takes it. Hello? She still has a daughter, people! A family! Maybe you could try to visit? Maybe even apologize? Nah, that's too much trouble.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of sentimental feel-goodisms that I didn't really care for. Like the cancerous mother who - inspired by her daughter - \\"decides to live\\" and suddenly becomes her own champion for social justice. Or Evil Hilly, who gets forced to eat it. Oh, and she also gets a cold sore at one point. Because that's what happens to EVIL people - cold sores!<br /><br />The worst part is when it takes sentimentalism and combines it with a lack of logic in order to create a result that makes you feel good - until you wonder what you are cheering about. A good example is when the maid steals a ring and tries to pawn it. We're supposed to feel sorry for her later when the evil redneck cops arrest her. Why? Because Hilly is EVIL, so to heck with her. And the woman really, REALLY needs the money. It's for the children. Also, she just \\"found\\" the ring, she it's not really stealing. Um, no.<br /><br />Yes, I know she stole out of desperation for her kids. And if Hilly had been caring enough or not-racist enough, she would have loaned her the $75 she needed. But wait a minute! We're supposed to hate Hilly because she won't loan the lady $75? That makes her racist? Hello, people! That's a lot of money for back then! Personally, I wouldn't even loan that much money to my brother today, let alone back then. Racism's got nothing to do with it.<br /><br />One of the odd things about this movie is the very premise of it. A white woman is trying to \\"help\\" black women by telling their side of the story. But the only thing she ends up \\"helping\\" is getting herself a nice a job and getting the main black maid fired (along with countless others, probably). So by helping these women, she is actually exploiting them. Am I missing something? Or am I just blind? Why are other people seeing a virtue here where I'm not?<br /><br />Let's face it. A book like The Help would never have been published, let alone become a hit. What white woman back then would have been interested in buying a book showing a black person's side of the story? The fact that the Jim Crow laws and racial segregation still existed shows that the vast majority of whites weren't too interested in what black people thought about anything.<br /><br />Another thing that irked me was how Abilene was fired at the end after Skeeter abandoned her, but we are supposed to be okay with that because Abilene says she's going to become a writer. (Again with the \\"Writer\\" Heroines... Sheesh!) I didn't expect a happy ending. But become a writer? Yeah, right.<br /><br />There's another thing worth mentioning. Many have taken to writing glowing reviews of the incredible acting of Viola Davis in this movie. That's much ado about nothing to me. She was okay. Not bad acting, but nothing outstanding either. I think people who do this are mostly white people who are trying to overcompensate and prove they don't have any internal racism by giving big props to a black actress. I mean, the woman is certainly talented and competent, but no more than anyone else in the movie.<br /><br />I will say this. My 1 star review is not fair. The movie deserves more than that. But my review won't get read if I give it a higher rating, so from my self-centered viewpoint, 1 star it is. There are plenty of 5-star ratings already, so it's not like my rating is going to make a difference.<br /><br />One thing I liked was seeing a few scenes from Clarksdale, Mississippi in this movie. Having been to Clarksdale many times, I thought this part was really cool.<br /><br />Back to the story. The main problem I have upon watching this is I don't know what to believe. The world has changed so much from the Jim Crow era that I'm unwilling to accept the history of it wrapped in a saccharine-sweet feel-good movie. I would like to see a movie depicting the real struggles that took place, without a bunch of sentimental fluff. I want the harsh truth. Not a sugar-coated feel-good summer chick flick. Guess I'll keep looking.<br /><br />I want to see the world the way it really was, if possible. Where blacks pulled themselves out of the hole through a lot of grit and determination, not the storybook movie lie where long-suffering blacks are finally \\"saved\\" by kindly, progressive white people. At least this movie made me think about that, and want to read more of the actual history. So that's something.
B005TVYVI2|5.0|The Finis Tempo Trainer Pro is a nice simple timer that slips into a swim cap or under the band of your goggles.  It has 3 buttons and a clock.  The top button is for mode select and timer reset.  The bottom two buttons are for the timer up/down and the on/off functions.  Push the right button to turn it on.  The top button is to select your mode and push both bottom buttons to turn the unit off.<br />It is really easy to set the unit up.  Select the mode you want to try, set your desired time, push the reset button and you are off.  The tempo trainer is advertised as a stroke tempo timer.  I really like to use it as a lap tempo trainer.  The instructions give you a lot of good advice on how to set the timer to suit your needs.  It is also easy to figure it out for yourself.  I don't like to carry instructions around so I just do my own thing.  Here are some of the things I like to do with the temp trainer:<br />Set the timer at 30 seconds then see how long it takes me to lap the timer.  Take a 30 second break the repeat until I can't catch it anymore.<br />Set the timer at 30 seconds, increase the speed by one second until I can't keep up any more.  Take a 30 second break then repeat.<br />Set the timer for 25 seconds then maintain the pace for a mile.  If I want to see if I can do a sub 30 minute mile, I try to stay ahead of the timer.<br /><br />I like the tempo trainer.  It is a simple device that helps me vary my workouts.  I tend to get into a rut with swim training.  Having an easily changeable metronome in your ear encourages change.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fits well under the Finis Lightning goggle band and does not fall out<br />Very comfortable<br />The timer is very easy to reset while swimming<br />Easy to use while swimming<br />It encourages change to workouts<br />Instructions are not really required to get the thing working<br />Different beep tones, I prefer the triple beep<br />Easy to reset, when things go wrong<br />Replaceable battery<br />It floats<br /><br />Cons:<br />It falls out of the headband of wide lens goggles<br />If it falls out, it can cause weird things to happen to the timer.  The timer has to be turned off then back on, to reset the matter<br />If you have wide lens goggles, it can be troublesome to get in the band just right.<br />You have to be careful when using the cadence timer.  It can cause short stroking, in an effort to keep up with the clock.<br /><br />I did not feel the timer under the race goggles.  When I was wearing wide goggles, I did not feel the timer until it fell off.  Once I got it into a good position, I could not feel it on my head.  This is one of those times, when simple is good.<br /><br />I really like the thing.  My pool is warm, which causes me to get lazy.  The Tempo timer keeps me awake with a goal to be met for every length.

0439023483|5.0|Wow. I don't know the last time a book has made me cry. Hands down, this has been the best YA book I've read in a long time. My favorite character is Rue. I know a lot of people are going to like Katniss and Peeta, seeing as the story follows the District 12 representatives, but Rue just caught my attention. She's the youngest of the tributes, barely 12 years old, but one of the brightest personalities in the entire book.<br /><br />The story is set in a time after North America - both its civilization and much of its territory - has collapsed. The Capital has taken over and separates the people into districts, with each one focusing on a different trade or skill. To stop any possible thoughts of rebellion, the Capital stages the Hunger Games every year. Each district is to send two tributes - one girl, and one boy, both between the ages of 12 to 18 - to fight to the death against all the other tributes. One person out of the 24 will survive. Whichever tribute survives will bring glory to their district, along with food and money that is desperately needed.<br /><br />The book follows Katniss Everdeen, from District 12, who volunteered to keep her younger sister Prim from being sent to the Hunger Games. Through her, we get a good look at what the Hunger Games actually mean for the Districts and the tributes. Alliances are formed in the Games but ultimately end because of backstabbing and survival. But it goes further than that. Through the Games, we get to see the absolute callousness the Capital has for these children's lives. While they are fighting for their life, the Capital citizens are betting on who is going to win, while sending small gifts to help their favorites.<br /><br />The characterization, plot, story, everything was executed amazingly. You get drawn into the story and react to each character, each situation, even if it's just because you want to reach into the book and shake Katniss until she sees what is right in front of her. This book makes you not just believe the emotions, but feel them as well. It gives a good, sometimes harsh but much needed look at what people can do to each other, and the lengths people will go to stay in power.ot just believe the emotions, but feel them as well. It gives a good, sometimes harsh but much needed look at what people can do to each other, and the lengths people will go to stay in power.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Whoa, not sure what happened, but there's no coincidence that I just updated this app. My daily driving habits consist of public radio and traffic in the morning (45min commute to Indianapolis and listening to WFYI...without the analog reception issues of the AM radio), then 97.9 HD3 Indie rock on the way home after work. But now? 97.9 HD3 Baltimore with the AAC feed crashes my phone everytime after 15 minutes. Spotify has no issues, but I want a radio station playing random good tunes. The commute sucks now.

B0073Q0DZG|5.0|This movie was amazing! I have been in love with birds since I was 2 years old and I can honestly say, watching the characters follow their journeys across North America, I was just as excited as if I were doing a Big Year myself. At the same time, I believe that the message of this movie speaks across the passion. Is winning a competition worth sacrificing your life for or is it better to follow a dream and to achieve greatness in your own eyes? I'll let you decide!

B005NAE04E|5.0|I came late to Neil Gaiman's work after avoiding the man like the plague for years simply because I had read 'Good Omens', which he co-authored with Terry Pratchett, and being a long-time Pratchett fan I was disappointed because it was not 'pure Pratchett' and thenceforth ignored Gaiman.  However having discovered 'American Gods' and enjoyed it, I found that I liked 'Neverwhere' even more.  Gaiman lacks a lot of the south west of England humour of Pratchett, but, like Pratchett he succeeds in inventing a coherent fantastic alternative reality.  If you are looking for swords and sorcerers, then this book is not the one you want, but if you enjoy a journey into a world of the totally wierd which is only a whisker away from the world we all know, then here it is.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone who enjoys their fantasy served up with a twist of commentary on our contemporary society.

B001QWBM62|5.0|I've worked with professional sound equipment and I have to admit that this is one of the best portable units out there! You can use  the built in mics or connect external mics to it as well. The unit is easy to use and is very intuitive. For those that are just getting into audio recording, this is a must have. I also use this as a secondary recording unit when I am recording from my Canon 5D Mark II. The 5D has this weird ticking sound when it is recording so I use this as an external mic. I then use FinalCut Pro with PluralEyes to sync the audio and video together.<br /><br />Pros: Sounds quality is amazing, light, portable, easy to use, swappable memory.<br /><br />Cons: Bulky and not ergonomic.<br /><br />Additions: I would also consider getting the RedHead for Zoom. This is a cover that help with noise and wind. This too is a must have!
1451627289|5.0|[[ASIN:1451627289 11/22/63: A Novel]]<br /><br />This is the most interesting Stephen King book I have read. It is not a horror novel as many people associate with the author. It is an interesting interpretation of JFK's Assassination, although that event is such a small part of the story. Actually, it is the other events that lend credence to my review. The concept of a portal is not new, but the reset is. I will say no more so as not to disclose too much of the story. I could not put the book down. Normally a book of this length would take me three times longer to finish. I know people who are not necessarily Stephen King fans, but are raving about the story.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's a rare trilogy where the end is the best book. Normally they start well then fade into awfulness...I'm looking at you game of thrones.... Fortunately this seris builds towards a great end to a series I grew to enjoy.
B004XNPQUO|1.0|I want a game, not a bunch of ads or my data being mined. Good game, but not worth it.
B000SEGHT6|5.0|One of the most brilliant books of all time.  Layers of parallels, insightful, witty, dark, humility... all the aspects of a brilliant masterpiece yet reads so simply that its a light page turner at the same time.  It moves the reader around without effort through a roller coaster of emotion and thoughts.  So many times you will put the book down for a few seconds and say to yourself \\"wow, i never thought of it like that\\".  If you don't read this book you choose to be ignorant of many things life is showing you.<br />Derek
B002JVWQSW|5.0|The DVDs arrived well before the predicted date in exactly the condition promised--we are very happy and enjoying watching! A great value.
B006671NPM|5.0|We all know how the movie is, i'm not a film critic here, im just trying to help others out.  This is my first review.  This came with an extra bluray disc to my surprise.  3D is pretty good.  worth buying if you love the series and/or love 3D.  I own 97% of every 3D blu ray and DVD ever made in the entire world as of today.

B0052U59F4|5.0|Price is crazy in here, don't pay more for a book, just buy it from the Publisher House where the price is $19.99 for paperback editions on each book not almost a $100!!! that's too much.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|First, I was excited about the quick service I received; it came in just a few days (by regular mail) and that was important in my circumstances. In addition, I changed the address where it was to be delivered and the Salvation Army in LA where it came from were gracious about it and EFFICIENT.  The quality of the DVD is excellent and durable.  My 5-year old granddaughter whom I got it for has watched it OVER and OVER (countless times) and it maintains its high quality. Thanks, Amazon.  Zoe
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works well on HTC Thunderbolt. Fun for many hours. Plenty of achievements to unlock and mini games after you finish adventure mode twice.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|It's a game like Myst, only even simpler.  I finished it in a single day but enjoyed it very much.  It's pretty to run around in and not taxing to solve.  If that's what you're expecting and want, you'll have a good time.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I WAS IMPRESSED THAT HE AND HIS FANILY WANTED A TRUE DISCRIPTION OF HIS CHARACTER AND HIS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.  IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING BOOKS I'VE EVER READ.  HE TRUELY DID CHANGE THE WORLD WITH HIS INVENTIONS AND SALES AND SELECTION OF PEOPLE TO DO THE JOB.  HIS I PHONE HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED THE CELL PHONE INDUSTRY AND THE DEMANDS OF THE PUBLIC.  HE WAS RIGHT, WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WE WANTED UNTILL HE GAVE IT TO US.
B000UZQI0Q|3.0|Not to impressed by this serie from Brandn Sanderson, typical fantasy writing with a twist on the magic system. No big suprises in the plot, and characters are not espesially interesting. All in all a mediocre book
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Being very into animation myself, Miyazaki has made numorous films, each with wonderful worlds and characters.<br />PONYO is a very unique tale based on the old story of \\"The little mermaid\\", and follows the journey of<br />a goldfish who wishes to become human after becoming attached to a young 5 year old boy. Its a story both kids and adults can enjoy, and just might bring out the inner child in you.<br />A must see for any animation lover!
B005GI0NWQ|5.0|Just like on the movie, enjoyable soundtrack. I downloaded it online so I had it right away. It reminds me of the deeper South and has a historical feel to it.
6300274268|3.0|its a good movie!! however VHS tapes must be out of date.. I watched this once and the tape inside the VHS got tangled up in my VHS player, cant be the player because i watch VHS tapes all the time.
B001OSIV62|4.0|I first heard of what happened in this documentary from a children's book I was reading with my kids. Seemed unbelievable to me but when I saw this movie I had to watch it.<br /><br />The mere thought of walking a tightrope between the world trade center towers just freaks me out, even as I type this. But the drive to make this happen. The ingenuity of how to make it work. Amazing.<br /><br />The story is part prank and part intelligence mission. If you ever had the benefit of being up in those towers when they were around you have a clear picture of how high up that is. Crazy.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I've wanted to practice playing chess before I play with a person and this is a wonderful way to get that practice.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Buy them all because you will not be able to stop reading once you start! Can't wait to read more by the author.
0756404738|5.0|I very much like epic fantasy and was not let down by both The Name of the Wind and The Wise Mans Fear by Rothfuss.  Unlike many books today that are severly edited to keep the books to about 400 pages or less, it is great to see this BIG book make it to shelves. This book should be approached like a slow walk through a great forest.  There is so much to take in along the way. I truly loved both and anxiously await the third installment.
B003ES61EE|1.0|From reading other reviews I think I must have a faulty item. It's being returned. The tip of the pen, no matter how much I turn the lid, doesn't get any of the \\"powder\\" on it that I am used to from other lens pens. It doesn't clean my lens at all, and the reversible tip is so flexible that it pops out when any pressure at all is applied in the cleaning process.<br /><br />The brush end is great, as it has been on any other lens pen I've used.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read The Hunger Games because of all of the hoopla I had heard about it.  The hoopla was well deserved!  In fact, I went on to read the rest of the trilogy including Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Hats of to Suzanne Collins for writing three books that kept me at the edge of my seat and for choosing to make her lead character a strong believable young woman. The imagery and events in the post apocolyptic world setting may not appeal to everyone but I had no problem with it.  Great read!
B005FMZWD8|5.0|Great gift box, the workmanship is hi quality for the $85.00 I paid...more then happy with my purchase. The color is very bright and looks great in the sun.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Very enjoyable, so much better than the movies we Americans butcher. This flick is actually scary because it's not overdone and typical. The characters are vivid, the acting is excellent.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think its ok but whenever I click free coins it makes me foreclose and it gets really annoying : 
B007857FOO|4.0|I'm not a big fan of the twilight series myself but I thought I'd let the fans who check this item out know to check with any walmart's in your area for this set. It is a walmart exclusive edition, and it's $23-dvd, $26-BR in store.
0385737955|4.0|For the longest time I put off reading this book due to some unsavory reviews I read. Do I ever regret that decision! This was a fantastic book! I didn't really know what to expect as far as the direction the story might take. There were many surprises and heart-pumping moments that I never saw coming.<br /><br />The story centers around Thomas, who is thrust into a completely unknown place, The Glade, with no recollection of his life previously. The Glade is home to a hundred or so young boys who have created a working society from the ground up. Surrounding the Glade is an enormous maze that seems impossible to solve. Thomas has a burning desire, a desire that could have fatal consequences, to be a maze runner in hopes of solving the maze. As if being stranded in what seems to be a never-ending nightmare isn't enough, Thomas is not well-liked by some of his new companions to the point of being accused of things Thomas has no memories of. Dashner writes in true form from a male perspective but does it uniquely to gain readers of both genders. The timing and pace of events throughout The Maze Runner coincided perfectly, creating a well-written thrill ride.
B004JMZPJG|2.0|I wish I had spent more money on a better bag for my prized camera. I purchased this bag a couple months ago and it worked well for a time... until I dropped it (like less that a foot from the ground.) Because of the way that the camera sits in the bag, with the lens facing down (it fits no other way), my slr lens took the impact. So now the end of the lens is at a tilt and wedged in place. The local camera shop told me it isn't worth it to fix it because of cost since it was just the standard kit lens. So now I have to buy another lens (luckily it was just a kit lens) but that's still $125 minimum! I can't imagine a more expensive lens being damaged due to the complete lack of protection that this bag provides. I'm giving it two stars simply because the lens didn't crack. Basically this bag will protect your camera from scratches. It also doesn't provide much storage and the strap is very cheaply made. I never give bad reviews but this is just crazy. If the fall had been from higher up I might understand but what is a camera bag for? I'll be giving the bag to my mom for her point-and-shoot. I would NOT recommend this bag to anyone for their pricy SLR.
B002ZG99NG|4.0|Every character is believable. The direction is amazing.<br />The feel of the film is honest. People trying to make<br />that one big score that will take them to the promised land.<br />The story has been told many times but this movie still seem fresh.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I really enjoyed this game on my kindle fire. I agree that is a little pricey. Keep these great hidden object games. coming G5.
0307269752|5.0|I would have to say that this is probably the best mystery<br />thriller I ever read. So cleaver the way it forces you to<br />keep turning pages. I lost many hours of sleep because I<br />couldn't put it down.
B006OFN0SE|3.0|Here is an interesting apples-and-oranges question: Which of the following is more pervasive, our desire to air dirty laundry in public or the powers of the federal government? In the early decades of the 20th century this was a silly question as \\"detectives\\" were unaware of such basic forensic science as fingerprinting and everyone agreed that a man's private affairs remained private.<br /><br />J. Edgar Hoover, the subject of Clint Eastwood's biopic, may have done more than anyone to create our modern America. Leonardo DiCaprio takes on this most difficult of roles in Eastwood's dark and detailed \\"J. Edgar,\\" a movie that somehow adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Hoover's legend just sits there, taunting the filmmaker. At 29, he took over the Bureau of Investigation and ruled like a czar for the next 48 years.<br /><br />In the movie's most successful scenes, Hoover builds the Bureau on science and zeal, fueled by his boundless ambition and the power of secrets. No agent could steal the limelight from Hoover, a true glory hound (all in the interests of promoting the Bureau, he claimed). Even though the Bureau nabbed notorious criminals and \\"solved\\" the Crime of the Century (the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby), Hoover had no signature triumph or even a definitive foe. But he did fight and win innumerable power struggles with eight presidents. No one dared cross him. There is story enough for a good miniseries, much less a feature film.<br /><br />Then there is the juicy stuff about Hoover that you have probably heard, like his cross-dressing and sexual orientation. Eastwood gamely but respectfully explores Hoover's unorthodox private life. Young Hoover is an oddball, raised by a domineering mother (Judi Dench) and living with her well into his adult years. Hoover takes a young Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) on an early date to the Library of Congress to show off the card file system he created ... and proposes. She rejects him firmly, and he responds by makingher his lifelong personal secretary. Hoover also forms a lasting relationship with fellow agent Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer, in an under-appreciated performance) that is so close that the rumors of homosexuality seem like a foregone conclusion. The truth is much more complex. Mother, Gandy, and Tolson all loved Hoover in their way, but each relationship brought with it clearly defined boundaries.<br /><br />Eastwood has made a handsome movie (the period cinematography by Tom Stern is appropriately grim and dark) that ticks off all the major points of the Hoover story. But ultimately Hoover defies us all and remains a frustrating, unsatisfying subject to the end. Put \\"J. Edgar\\" next to other biopics that aimed high and missed -- \\"Amelia\\" and \\"Hoffa\\" are also on this list. \\"J. Edgar\\" may not miss by much, but if Hoover demanded anything, it was perfection.<br /><br />Extras on the \\"J. Edgar\\" DVD are limited to language options and a short film, \\"A Complicated Man,\\" in which the cast and Eastwood discuss the Hoover enigma. Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.
B003UESJDI|3.0|The best thing in this film is the extremely attractive body of Gemma! The plot is weakish, the rock star boyfriend emetic, but it gets away with it. The main failing was that it was a Region 1 disc, and no info about this, and it made me change region once again...
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I run a small local gaming server and this is much easier and allows for much greater access 24/7 then any other method I've found
B0017ZM3S4|4.0|\\"Aquariums in Pyongyang\\" is excellent book about IMHO wors commmunistic empire that ever existed (and I lived in one). Amazing story that reveals truth that should be known to everyone.
0545425115|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE The Hunger Games. After about the first ten pages, I couldn't put the book down. I begged my mom to get me a copy. (Yes, I started reading it in the books section at Target.) After I finished the first book, Catching Fire was a must-have. I finished that and moved onto Mockingjay, which made me cry. Multiple times. (It's a very beautiful book.) After being throughly captivated by the series, I wait eagerly for the movie on March 23rd. I'm anticipating the movie greatly and I'm PRAYIN' that they don't mess this one up. Lionsgate, you mess with Katniss, you mess with me.<br />And the rest of the world.<br />I reccomend this series to every person I meet. It's truly amazing how a single person can change the face of literature with three simple books.<br />Suzanne Collins, you rule.
B0045INTVA|5.0|I am only writing this review so this movie doesn't have the woefully misguided 3-stars from the single other reviewer.<br /><br />There are a handful of truly great Vietnam war films, and they generally each cover their own ground. Full Metal Jacket is kind of the exception in that it covers ground the other three all do separately.<br /><br />Platoon covers the actual combat, the feeling of hell that it produced in an individual experiencing the fighting, the jungle, the trauma in the moment that the trauma is happening.<br /><br />The Deer Hunter covers the post-war trauma, the long-scale effect on the psyche of a veteran.<br /><br />Apocalypse Now covers the psychological (and poetic) heart of war, that is, the core of what war means, which is hatred, fear, and the merciless nature of the universe. After all, it's based on 'Heart of Darkness.' It might, overall, be the most terrifying and compelling of them all. In turn, Heart of Darkness and this movie are based on a long line of literary background called the \\"katabasis\\" in Greek, that is, the descent into the underworld. It's epic, punctuated by scene after scene which turns dark and twisted, and the protagonist is self-compelled, moving forward into hell without knowing why--because as evil exists, he feels drawn to it, to try to understand it, or if he cannot, to become a part of it. Transitively, it asks you to try to understand evil.<br /><br />If I didn't already own this, I would most definitely buy it instantly for 6 dollars, as anyone who sees this page and has not seen the film should do.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was an amazing trilogy! I'm the type of reader, where I need a good book to actually get hooked. And this had me from the beginning! After the 2nd chapter, I couldn't put it down. I'm very excited for the movies to come out. And I'm so glad a friend recommended the books first! I will keep this on my kindle and definitely re-read it in the future!
0545123275|5.0|The cover's cold. The red dot stares from its center. And the title, Shiver, feels hauntingly frozen. Even without knowing what this book was about I knew I wanted to read it.<br /><br />Author Maggie Stiefvater's writing is haunting as well. Two voices tell the tale. One, a teen girl, fond of wolves, remembers how she was bitten as a child. Oddly, it didn't make her scared and her not being scared rings perfectly true. She's sensible, logical, warm and kind--summer's daughter as winter draws near.<br /><br />The other voice is that of a slightly older boy. Honest, insecure, wary and true, Sam becomes a faithful but wounded friend to Grace. Devoted to poetry, listening with heightened senses, he knows things others may never understand. And winter calls.<br /><br />When a boy at school is killed in a freak wolf attack, Grace's beloved wolf-pack comes under threat. And when Sam meets Grace, that threat takes a personal turn.<br /><br />These teens have plenty to be angst-ridden about, but the author makes them lively and real without the endless introspection of some other teen books. They stretch moral boundaries with their choices, but their motivations ring true. I want to hear Sam sing. I want to read more of his poems--another thing the author does really well, with Sam's lyrics as natural as his actions, never reading like an author's intrusion.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, admiring the author's skill, delighting in complex characters,  and hoping against hope that the unlikely \\"cure\\" would succeed. I know there's a sequel and I'll read it sometime, but for now, the story feels pleasingly complete and I'm glad I finally got around to reading it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I got this book for my birthday and saved it for a reading treat.

B0071T5PN0|5.0|I absolutely love the resurgence of heavy metal and hard rock bands from days gone by (see my review of [[ASIN:B00192KCQ0 Death Magnetic]]), and A Different Kind of Truth from Van Halen is the latest entry to grab my attention.  Get ready to hop in your time machine and take a trip back to 1980 (for the most part).  For the record I consider this the first legitimate Van Halen since 1984 gave us \\"Jump\\" and \\"Panama\\".  This is a great album because it is in a word fun.<br /><br />Could anyone other than David Lee Roth deliver a line like \\"It's looking like the city towed my other apartment\\" with a straight face and get away with it?  That's exactly what he does on \\"She's The Woman\\".  DLR is the absolute master of the showboat front man for a rock band, and it is great to have him back in the fold.<br /><br />However, like they say in the infomercials, \\"But wait, there's more!\\"  Eddie Van Halen is back in guitar god form - no synthesizer here.  The opening guitar line on \\"You And Your Blues\\" removes any doubt that it is a Van Halen song.  It is his trademark sound.  He also absolutely shreds on his solos, and the best example is on \\"China Town\\".  What is also awesome is how Wolfgang joins the act and bass toward the end.  While there has to be an element of nepotism, the kid can flat out play.  They only place you really miss Michael Anthony is in the area of vocal harmonies.  This is left purely in Eddie's realm now.  It's not a huge loss, but it is one thing that old school fans will notice.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least we have to give consideration to Alex Van Halen's drum work.  He takes center stage leading off \\"As Is\\" with a forceful and deliberate opening.  Other times he lets it fly with reckless abandon like he does on the aforementioned \\"China Town\\".<br /><br />I could on, but this should be enough to convince folks that Van Halen is back.  This is meant to be played in the car, loud, with the windows down.  Feel the wind in your hair and enjoy the ride in the Van Halen time machine.ride in the Van Halen time machine.
B001K3ENEA|4.0|An economical pair of circumaural phones that initially sound hollow and tinny when played at low volumes, but livens up at mid/higher volumes.  Great features like single left cord, light weight, great fit.  Not bright at all with decent bass.  Easy to listen to for what I use it for: isolation while surfing- if you have a noisy enviornment, it doesn't matter how great your equipment is when you can't listen to it.  After about 50 hours, the sound is amazingly flat and detailed without harshness.<br /><br />As usual, it is personal preference, but also varies with equipment, impedence matching, head shape, head width.  Generally, these phones have less edge on them so they may be better listening straight out of a laptop.  Guitar strings feel really detailed but vocals lose lipsmacking crispness, and there's not much detail in the bass.  Very efficient for non-amped used, but when amped, they sound fuller and cleaner and fast attacks (alternative rock) sound less muddy.<br /><br />I don't know if these have the acclaimed XXL drivers, but there is plenty of bass and an even amount of mids/highs.  Guitar strings sound great with detail.  Also, I don't know if they have that tuned port of the more expensive AKG's that reduce that bass pressure that builds in circumaural headphones.  Well, whatever, it sounds goods and I welcome the sound isolation.  I can concentrate on the music and hear such great talent not just background noise.<br /><br />EDIT: These 'phones made me want to upgrade my computer audio system and, guess what, I did!  I think that these are decent phones for the super low price and even though people don't like high clamping force, it is high clamping force and more surface contact patch (possibly a square profile vs. a donut concave profile) that makes for better isolation and also, better controlled sound.  I bet a better ear cushion would make these sound a notch better.  Of course, they don't compare well with the top 20 head-fi org headphones, but they are a great 2nd pair for the office.
B0078XM4SI|4.0|Roses is what I would call neoclassical music from The Cranberries.  After their debut CD they really started to emphasize more of a grunge sound - see \\"Zombie\\" or \\"Promises\\".  Roses takes me back to the simplicity of \\"Linger\\" or \\"Dreams\\" yet it is not simply a rehashing of their original material.  Quite the contrary Roses is a lot of different nuances woven together in a sonic tapestry.<br /><br />Long time fans will agree that \\"Tomorrow\\" would be right at home on Everybody Else Is Doing It So Why Can't We?.  It is the song with the least modernization if you will.  The next song \\"Fire & Soul\\" uses a drum/drum machine line that called to mind \\"Standing Eight Count\\" from Jacob Dylan's Women + Country.  Then \\"Raining In My Heart\\" has an accordion line that reminded me of \\"Long December\\" from The Counting Crow's Recovering the Satellites.  Other sonic variations include the use of strings in \\"Waiting In Walthamstow\\" and \\"Show Me\\".<br /><br />Other songs really grabbed me with their mood and emotion.  Both \\"Losing My Mind\\" and \\"Astral Projection\\" are dark and sad journeys into the frayed ends of sanity.  The latter has a combination of instrumentation and vocal delivery that I find almost gut-wrenching (in a good way if that's possible).<br /><br />Roses is not without its missteps though.  While the instruments are solid no lyrics could save a song called \\"Schizophrenic Playboy\\" (really?).  Also, I don't know what to call \\"So Good\\" other than filler or fluff.  While lyrical brilliance has never been the hallmark of The Cranberries, this is too close to what I call a seven/eleven song - seven words repeated eleven times.  It feels that repetitive.  These are not enough to ruin the overall experience of Roses, but it does keep it from being a top notch album.  There is definitely much more good than bad with this new collection of songs.  I think fans of The Cranberries will find a lot to like.

B004XNPQUO|3.0|Not a particularly spectacular, original title--but if you enjoy &quot;level-pack&quot; style puzzles such as Twist n' Catch and Cut the Rope, you'll enjoy the physics and nice, non-flashy graphics of Gravity Burst. As one reviewer said, the aiming-with-gravity concept has been seen before on web Flash games, but it's perfectly well-adapted, and even best suited for, the touchscreen device. Would earn a solid 4 stars with a more unified visual and auditory aesthetic (e.g. background ambiance). Runs on HTC Merge without problems.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really liked the start. And I loved the photographs, even on Kindle, although I looked at a print copy and it was better. But I thought the end faded a bit. Once the character got to the island, really. And I could smell a sequel coming for the last several chapters, so that was a bit annoying.

1400069289|5.0|Charlie Duhigg has written a really important book.  This transcends the usual journalistic treatment of behavior by having great stories, serious analysis, and fascinating insights into the reasons that people -- and organizations -- act as they do.  It's a book that will change the way you look at \\"ordinary\\" actions, routines, actions, mind-sets.  You'll be glad you read it, and it will stick with you in very positive ways long after you've read it ...  get it now!
B005NS5CX4|5.0|This album is great! I love the songs, the group and the album. Great job Lady Antebellum!! My favorite is We Own the Night.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun but it takes so many coins to open a new game, and some of the games are really hard and you just can't pass them.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really liked this series. The characters were interesting and Colin's does a great job keeping you turning the pages. I can't wait for the movie(s).
1401937519|5.0|I have heard Anita's story before. I was looking forward to reading about it in detail. Her story is very interesting. The facts speak for themselves - either there is somewhere wonderful to go to when we die, no matter who we are and what we've done, or our minds are able to respond to conscious commands as well as the usual unconscious ones, (e.g. digestion, hormone regulation etc.), such that if we believe good health is possible, our minds are capable of doing what is necessary to reverse disease, and do it very quickly.<br /><br />Since Anita's experience happened in a hospital and the facts can be verified, these seem to be the only plausible alternatives. Definitely something to think about.
1878424319|5.0|This guy really understands life and the things that plagues us, as I was reading I began thinking of all the people I wanted to read it... anyone who reads this will certainly unlock things about themselves they didnt know was there, and more importantly how to be happier.
B0052U59F4|1.0|This was the most boring, ridiculous book I have ever read!  The narrative is terribly written, and the author repeats everything 1000 times.  If I had a dollar for every time the lead \\"bit her lip\\" I would be a very rich woman.  Save your money, brain cells and time- do not read this book.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|This movie was awesome from start to finish, I will not repeat all the positive review's. In case you're wondering about this Blu-ray(not the single disc one). I have to say it's one of the most stunning looking and sounding Blu's I own. I was blown away by the quality. Definite must own.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I'm completely surprised by how often I waste time with this app! Super simple, super fun, smooth graphics on my Rezound. Kind of hypnotic, really. Hope dev's will consider enhancing this great app to allow saving my &quot;work&quot; for use as wallpaper.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I have to admit that I didn't know much about Tina Fey or watch 30 rock but I bought this book on a whim.  It has made laugh a lot and relate to Tina as a fellow dorky girl. She cracks me and now I am watching 30 Rock on Netflix and now I can't get enough of her!
B006PHD0RW|3.0|The for the most part this is a well developed game, and I accualy played for a good while. But in the end you end up frustrated and wishing the controls where as good as the game play.<br />I don't see how there's anyway this game won't produce a ton of do overs because the rotation works randomly. And its random no matter what technique you use. Its a shame because there's so much there to like, but there's way to many equally good games in the market with spot on working controls.
B0042JSSVI|4.0|I'm really into this period of Roman times and if you are too then can I also recommend Imperium and Lustrum also by Robert Harris.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Favorite series ever! I read this book in a couple days & had to immediately buy the next mockingjay. Its so addicting. I never thought everything that happened in this book would have I was surprised. I love it is a book both me & my older children enjoy together.
B004MYF6YK|5.0|Amazon really needs to stop blending all of the disparate reviews for one movie together. It's very easy to get confused as to which set has what features, etc. In this case, however, it worked out rather well for me, price-wise.<br /><br />This Blu Ray set is NOT the four-film \\"Complete Superman Collection\\" which was released on DVD and contained bare-bones editions of \\"Superman\\" I through IV, nor is it the \\"Christopher Reeve Superman Collection\\" which contained special editions of the original four films. No, this is the \\"Superman Motion Picture Anthology\\" (which was known as \\"The Ultimate Superman Collection\\" on DVD), the massive eight-disc deluxe set which contains \\"Superman\\" I (expanded and original theatrical versions) through IV, the Donner Cut of \\"Superman II\\", and \\"Superman Returns\\" complete with the original opening, a newer transfer and a slew of bonus features. This version of the product (the version I received, anyway) was from the UK, but that doesn't really matter since Warner Bros. does not region lock their Blu Ray releases (hence the \\"Region Free\\" in the item's description) and this set is identical to the US version. Amazon lists this set for sale under the correct title of the Anthology as well as under the incorrect moniker of \\"The Complete Superman Collection\\". Buying this set under this incorrect name saved me about thirty dollars over the properly titled one, so budget hunters take advantage! Now, let's go through these one at a time:<br /><br />SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE - The first big-budget superhero film and, in many ways, still the best of them. Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz set the template for every other superhero origin movie that has come since. And Christopher Reeve, of course, is still the ultimate film superhero. \\"Superman: The Movie\\" proved that comic books could be translated to a different medium and be taken seriously, if treated seriously.<br /><br />The first two discs in this set are devoted to the expanded and original theatrical editions of \\"Superman: The Movie\\". I like the expanded version of the film just fine, but I grew up on the original version, so I prefer that one. It just seems to move better, and doesn't introduce a lot of head-scratchers like Lois Lane being the little girl on the train in Smallville who witnesses a young Clark running along at super speed (how old are her parents, anyway?). The transfer on this version is a fair bit better than the old Blu Ray release, which I also owned and did not include the theatrical version. There seems to have been more work done on the expanded version's transfer than the theatrical version; there's not so much excessive grain and the colors really \\"pop\\" on my 51-inch. However, there's not a huge difference overall (the picture on a 30+ year-old film that was a bit soft in parts to begin with is only going to look so good), not enough to make me stop watching the version I love. Sound has been redone in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, and it really makes a difference to my ears over the old disc, which was given a plain Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track. Just listen to that subwoofer rumble in the opening scenes flying over Krypton. Whoo!! Bonus features are all ported over from the four-disc DVD edition, including the early George Reeves feature, \\"Superman Vs. The Mole Men\\"; none are in hi-def.<br /><br />SUPERMAN II (theatrical)/SUPERMAN II: THE DONNER CUT - Boy, the comments one could make about this debacle. In the interest of saving time, I'll just cut right to it: neither one of these movies is truly on the level of the first film. I love them (both versions), but it's a fact. With the first movie, you got to see Richard Donner's vision of the character completely realized. But then, of course, the Salkinds got cold feet and dumped Donner (after he had already completed most of the shooting on \\"Superman II\\", including Marlon Brando's and Gene Hackman's scenes) and brought in Richard Lester to reshape and complete the film. The theatrical version of \\"Superman II\\" still works well, expanding on the character and mythology of Superman while keeping the action quotient high. The cast is still great and Terence Stamp creates one of the all-time great villains in General Zod. Richard Lester just added a little too much goofy humor for my taste (dude blowing backwards on roller skates, etc.), something that would run rampant in \\"Superman III\\". Also, there's a certain affection for the characters that is missing from the final product; it all seems a bit workmanlike. And don't get me started on the producers eliminating Brando's footage just to save a few bucks after the first film had already made millions of dollars at the box office. Everything that was good about \\"Superman II\\" seems to have been sourced from what Donner and Mankiewicz had already planned beforehand.<br /><br />In 2006, after years and years of fan petitions and requests (a few of which I signed, I will admit), the missing footage from Donner's planned version of \\"Superman II\\" (including the Brando scenes, which help this version improve immeasurably on the theatrical cut) was found, restored, re-edited and released using John Williams' original music from the first movie. Watching the Donner Cut, you immediately notice how much more he loves these characters, how the movie just feels right in a way that the theatrical version did not. The replacement of the theatrical version's opening action setpiece at the Eiffel Tower is a prime example. Donner's opener, in which Lois jumps out of a window at the Daily Planet in hopes of forcing Clark to reveal himself as Superman and save her, immediately shows the big differences between the two versions: the plot does not drive the characters in the Donner Cut, the characters drive the plot. The Kryptonian villains are treated more seriously and possess real menace (see the scene where they storm the White House). The Donner Cut also benefits from the restoration of the luminous footage shot by the late, great Geoffrey Unsworth, whose work on the sequel was mostly lost to Lester's harshly lit reshoots. There were certain scenes between Lois and Clark where she confronts him over his dual identity that Richard Donner planned to shoot but did not have the chance, so screen test footage was substituted. And that's where it hit me. Therein lay the problem with the Donner Cut: it's not actually Richard Donner's \\"Superman II.\\" It's as close as one can actually get to what could have been the best superhero film of all time in \\"Superman II\\", but that film does not exist, will never exist. All we have, thanks to the producers' greed and shortsightedness, is a reasonable facsimile with substituted footage and a rehashed ending (Donner and company never got to think up a new ending for \\"Superman II\\" after using its big turning-back-time climax for the first movie). Lest anybody think I'm just piling the blame on the Salkinds (though they totally deserve most of it), Donner and the driving force behind the project, filmmaker Michael Thau, shoot themselves in the feet by refusing to touch ANY of the Lester footage except where absolutely necessary, which gives rise to some mediocre line readings and bad dubs which were actually improved upon in Lester's theatrical cut (the scene where Superman challenges Zod to a fight at the Daily Planet springs to mind). I can understand Donner's feelings about the project, but a little compromise in this case might have gone a long way. As it is, the Donner Cut is now my preferred version of Superman II, but not by as huge a margin as I might have thought.<br /><br />Discs 3 and 4 are devoted to the two \\"Superman II\\"s. The transfer on the Donner Cut seems to be the same as the original Blu Ray release, which was pretty good. The theatrical cut of \\"Superman II\\" (which I've never seen on Blu Ray) fares pretty well and, like the Donner Cut, seems sharper than the first film. Again, the main difference is in the DTS-HD MA sound, which is fuller and more robust than the previously available Dolby Digital 5.1 track. All bonus features were ported over from the two-disc DVD of the theatrical cut and the previously released Donner Cut, respectively. All of the Fleischer/Famous Studios cartoons can be found on these two discs, with the first nine 'toons on Disc 3 and the second batch on Disc 4.<br /><br />SUPERMAN III/SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE - And here come the sad parts. \\"Superman III\\" was the first film where Richard Lester had control of the production from beginning to end, and boy can you tell. Overly slapstick-y, negligent of the main characters (poor Margot Kidder is on and off screen in two minutes flat), and worst of all, BORING. How do you make a Superman film BORING?! The only person who comes out of the thing with any dignity at all is, again, Christopher Reeve, who really sells the duality of Superman's character here (including a scene where \\"dark\\" Superman literally fights Clark Kent in a junkyard). About Richard Pryor, whom I have admired since I was a little kid, I can only say this: as a film actor, he was a terrific stand-up comedian. The only other useful thing to come out of this movie was the computer fraud plot device later referenced in \\"Office Space\\".<br /><br />Full disclosure: when I was a kid, the only Superman movie we had on VHS was \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\\" (God, I know, I know). I heard my dad talking about how terrible it was, but I was a kid and I figured what the heck, it's Superman! So, for a number of years, I had a hard time thinking that it's as bad as everyone says it is. Well, it is, it's terrible. But not as terrible as how Warner Brothers treated Christopher Reeve and the film. \\"Superman IV\\" was originally supposed to be a big-budget return to form for the franchise. Christopher Reeve came up with an engaging original story (the wisdom of Superman interfering in real-world nuclear politics notwithstanding) and the original cast, including Gene Hackman, would reunite to erase the lingering bad memory of \\"Superman III\\". Then Warner Brothers slashed the budget and script and shifted the property over to Golan-Globus/Cannon, purveyors of countless '80s cheesefests such as Chuck Norris' \\"Missing in Action\\" series and \\"American Ninja\\", and the rest is ignominious film history. Sadly, this would be Reeve's final take on the iconic character of Superman and, needless to say, it's not how his portrayal should be remembered.<br /><br />Discs 5 and 6 are devoted to these two masterpieces, and they receive better audio/visual treatment than they probably deserve. \\"Superman IV\\" in particular looks crisp on Blu, all the better to see the cheesy matte lines and wires. Both have DTS-HD MA tracks; \\"Superman III\\" receives a 5.1 track while \\"Superman IV\\" is relegated to plain 2.0 stereo. Bonus features of interest include a commentary by co-writer Mark Rosenthal and a bunch of deleted scenes on \\"Superman IV\\" (ported over from the Deluxe Edition DVD released a few years ago). They're not great, but at least they help to make sense of and flesh out the plot, such as it is.<br /><br />SUPERMAN RETURNS - Everybody seems to have a different take on this installment, Bryan Singer's homage to/continuation of the original Donner films. Some thought it was too reverent of the original, that Superman was too \\"emo\\" and that there was not enough action. I personally liked the film, although I think there is probably some validity to those criticisms. I still feel that Brandon Routh was a bit too young to properly portray a more seasoned Superman who has gone through the events of the first two Donner films, but he was pretty engaging in the role, handled the emotional aspects of the role with skill (which, to answer the \\"too emo\\" critics, OF COURSE Superman is going to be emotional with everything going on in this film, he's not some soulless robot) and generally acquitted himself very well in inevitable comparisons with Christopher Reeve. Kevin Spacey almost makes you forget Gene Hackman's version of Lex Luthor, edging closer to the malice and insanity of the original character in the comics. James Marsden (who jumped ship on the \\"X-Men\\" franchise with Singer for \\"Returns\\") does a good job as Lois' boyfriend, a guy who could believably rival Superman for Lois' affections. Probably the only weak link was Kate Bosworth as a bland, rail-thin Lois Lane who fails in every way to measure up to Margot Kidder's take on the character.<br /><br />Disc 7 is solely devoted to \\"Superman Returns\\", and it improves on the original Blu Ray in nearly every way. The transfer on the original disc (one of Warner Bros.' earliest forays into Blu Ray) was, to put it mildly, a little drab. Well, not so on this new transfer! We're talking reference quality here, it's that good. Every color pops and every detail shows; you can see the weave of Lex Luthor's crisp white suits, you can see the fine mesh of Superman's costume and the crinkles in the leather of his boots (and you can also see just how suspect the CGI Superman is during the shuttle rescue). But for once, the DTS-HD MA sound falls a bit short of what was already available on the previous \\"Superman Returns\\" Blu Ray: a lossless 5.1 PCM audio track. Audiophiles and collectors might want to hold on to their copies for that. Bonus features have been ported over from the original Special Edition DVD release, including a feature length documentary on all aspects of the making of the film. But even better (and probably one of the major reasons I bought this set), we get to see the original fully produced five-minute opener of \\"Superman Returns\\" in which Superman searches the remains of Krypton for survivors. I don't know why Singer felt the need to cut this opening, especially when it was already shot, scored, edited, the effects completed, and (God, I hate when films do this) some of it was included in the theatrical trailer. It was a terrific opening! I do remember reading an interview some years ago in which Singer spoke of his idea to include the opening in a future theatrical re-release; I guess he overestimated the public's interest in the film, as did Warner Bros., which gave \\"Superman Returns\\" a $175-million budget. In any case, I'm glad the people who liked the film finally get to see it.<br /><br />Disc 8 is strictly bonus material and contains \\"Look! Up in the Sky!\\", the previously released feature-length documentary produced by Bryan Singer on the history of the character, and a brand-new documentary--yet again feature length-- called \\"You Will Believe\\" which concerns the rise and fall (and future rise?) of the Superman franchise. Both documentaries are in hi-def. Also included are featurettes exploring the scientific basis behind Superman, the comic's mythology, a tribute to Christopher Reeve, and a terrible, terrible old TV pilot, \\"The Adventures of Superpup\\".<br /><br />Superman was the first superhero (and if you can't tell by now, my personal favorite--sorry, Batman) in comics, and the first superhero to make the leap to a big-budget, non-camp film. Richard Donner, Tom Mankiewicz, Christopher Reeve and others pushed the boundaries of the character and paved the way for every other comic book property in Hollywood to be taken seriously. It remains to be seen where the character goes next in movies (I have more than a few reservations about the new Zack Snyder film due out next year) but based on where he's been, Superman deserves much cinematic respect. And with this Blu Ray set, he gets it in a BIG way.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Interesting, nice graphic game. It was a pleasure to play it. Thank you very much. And hints are pretty helpful sometimes
B004XNPQUO|4.0|Like the fact that you don't have to fly chaotic as they stated. Interesting concept. As far as the LG OPTIMUS issue, the phone sucks. Can't get more clearer than that! LG needs to stick to kitchen appliances and rice cookers! ;)

B001RTSPVY|5.0|The Complete Second Season of Breaking Bad was everything I thought it would be and so much more.  The writers are wonderful and I love the different situations that Walter and Jesse get themselves into...well it's usually Jesse causing the problem because of how dumb he is and Walter coming to the rescue.  The characters are believable esp. the wife and the brother-in law Hank.  He so personifies his role with his bigoted attitude against criminals of different ethnic backgrounds but also gets creeped out by some things but has to put on a show in front of his co-workers about how big and bad he is.  All in all watching this series has left me wanting more.  Can't wait for season three to be repeated on tv or else I will most likely order it.

1451648537|3.0|Isaacson is a masterful storyteller, and he chooses fascinating recollections from Jobs and others who were close to him that create a clear illustration of his history and personality. The book chronicle's the birth and evolution of Apple, as well as the entire technology industry, including some interesting cameos of industry titans such as Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, John Sculley, etc. It also includes endearing characters, such as the famed Steve Wozniak (who can only be loved), developers and designers from Apple, and Laureen Jobs, who seems to be a great person. I enjoyed the book and was compelled to keep reading until I finished. That said, I started to fatigue on examples of Job's outrageously poor behavior and nasty treatment of the people around him. I was shocked, frankly, and I have a worry that this book will give license to a**holes everywhere that justifies their unchecked bullying \\"in the name of getting things right\\".<br /><br />Clearly, you can't argue with the outcome from Jobs' style - Apple did get it right, and their CEO's brilliance had everything to do with it. But as brilliant as he was, Jobs was equally untrustworthy, petty, and even cruel. I'm reminded of the children's poem: \\"When (s)he was good, he was very, very good, but when he was bad, he was horrid!\\" I came away just as impressed as I ever was with the genius of Jobs, but disappointed in his person, who I really had on a pedestal as a cool guy you'd be so lucky to know - um, not necessarily. And I have heard this confirmed from people who knew him.<br /><br />No doubt, however, I am living in the wake of his legacy, as a devout user of Apple's devices (iMac was my first home computer, and I have bought practically everything they have ever sold since). I love and appreciate the design and simplicity of these products, and also Apple's ability to get customer service right - so thanks for that Steve Jobs!
B00543RC0Y|5.0|I have read the reviews and some people say the special features Blue Rays does not play in US. It is probably due to the need to update the framework of the Blue-ray player, because all the blue-rays including the special features ones does play in United States. I have them and I love them. I live in New York! I strongly suggest this collection from UK better than the one offered by US. The special features of this Blue-ray collection is amazing! Be aware that the UK version of this set is sold in amazon.co.uk as well as in amazon.com.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|I've seen Shakespeare performed live several times, and seen several movie adaptations.  My first comment is that you have to *see* Shakespeare rather than read his work.  But even so, most productions border on the lifeless and melodramatic.  This version of The Tempest was alive... using visual effects that Shakespeare undoubtedly dreamed of but could never hope to produce on a stage.<br /><br />This was a visual treat... AND it was very well acted.  I never heard a line of dialog spoken that sounded stiff or \\"read\\".  Much to my surprise, I even thought Russell Brand did a very nice job in one of the comic roles.<br /><br />And what can be said about Helen Mirren?  She rocked it!  I am a new fan.  The only other Shakespeare movie that can be said to have been so well done is Romeo + Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio.  And maybe third place is Much Ado About Nothing with Kenneth Brannagh.<br /><br />The Tempest -- great movie!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I saw it when it came out for theaters... Let me rephrase that, I was forced to go see it because I REALLY didn't want to go. I had all ready found out what would happen, and I can't begin to explain how much I despised Andrew Lloyd Webber for just destroying Phantom for me. 1st off, as much as I dislike Raoul, there is no way that he somehow turned into a drunkard and gambler. He is to much of a twelve year old girl. 2nd, New York... Really? He disliked leaving the opera house before and was a recluse what made them think that it was okay to stick him on a boat and ship him off to America? I had read the reviews for the London performance, and not just the critics. I had also heard some of the music from the London cast. I really didn't want to see it.<br /><br />What saved this version was that it was the Australia version. Parts of the music had been changed, they had chosen a  great Christine, and their Erik was AMAZING. He really made the Phantom come to life. I am pre-ordering it. If you are a Phantom purist, you're going to have to let it stand alone from the movie/play/book, and if you can do that you'll find that it actually is really good.
0439023521|5.0|I don't have much to contribute since I'm not in the mood to write a detailed book review. I will just say that I am a sci-fi/fantasy nerd who enjoys things like Buffy, Joss Whedon, Twilight, Sookie Stackhouse series, LOTR, Eureka, Vampire Diaries, etc. and I plowed through this whole trilogy. And can't wait for the movie!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wonderful read, do not have to be a young adult to enjoy theses books. Was on vacation and had a hard time putting down. Looking forward to them in a movie format.
B00004R84J|5.0|Such a beautiful film!  It is however, very violent and bloody, but so were those times.  Cinematography was outstanding. Vintage Nigel Terry and Helen Mirren.  And of course, the haunting musical score featuring Wagner and Orff.  This is moviemaking at its best!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Just thought I'd make it known that this digital version is sold by Random House through Amazon & you will be charged sales tax. Amazon doesn't have a digital version of their own. I was charged sales tax & have never paid it on previous digital purchases, but never realized that you could be getting it from another source through Amazon. I called Amazon & they verified that they do not have their own digital version.

B00005BL2A|5.0|Of all the Depeche Mode albums from the post-Vince Clarke era, this one seems to get the least support from fans. If you follow Depeche Mode, you know they do tend to change things up now and then. They began as a happy-sounding synth band, gradually added guitars and became progressively darker (even going through an industrial period), shifted to a unique blend of grunge and gospel with Songs of Faith and Devotion, and went through another metamorphosis with Ultra. This album, released in 2001, is termed by some fans as \\"the love album\\" due to the nature of many of the songs. It's about as close to mainstream pop as DM ever got, although it's a different, more mature type of pop from its era (keep in mind we were still in the midst of the boy band/pop princess era in May 2001). I'll go through this album song by song to highlight each selection, especially to look at some of the underrated tracks.<br /><br />\\"Dream On\\": This was by far the most well-known single from the album (and was the only track to make it on the 2006 Greatest Hits compilation). The song is rather simple but very catchy. The album version is a little different from the single--it's longer overall thanks to an introduction and a slightly different song structure.<br /><br />\\"Shine\\": My personal favorite track on this album. This is an unusual song in that it's a ballad sung by Dave Gahan (most ballad-type songs are given to Martin Gore). This should have been a single--the lyrics are meaningful and memorable and the vocals are incredible (they spotlight Dave's high register quite nicely). The synths in the background create a great mood, too. If there's any one track you should purchase if you're getting a la carte tracks on Amazon or another music service, this would be my pick.<br /><br />\\"The Sweetest Condition\\": I've heard a few people compare this to \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" from Violator. While I can see a few comparisons beyond the similar titles, I can't say this song generates the same overall mood as the earlier work. Overall, a nice track, and one that spotlights the great harmonies Dave and Martin can create when singing together.<br /><br />\\"When the Body Speaks\\": Another slower song sung from the heart, again with Dave on lead vocals. While not as memorable as \\"Shine\\", it's still a great effort overall and essentially is the fourth and final segment of the first part of the album (the next track, as described below, is far different). My favorite part of this song is the background guitar, which adds a certain element to this song I really like. The ending of this song, with the soft guitar solo, is something that will stick in your head forever.<br /><br />\\"The Dead of Night\\": My first reaction to hearing this song: where did this come from? This song is completely different from anything on the album and seems like an Ultra outtake. To use an analogy: you've got all these clean-cut guys in suits (the first four tracks) and then the guy with the long hair, tattoos, and beater top shows up. The lyrical quality of this song is a little below the others and represents the first song that doesn't really have to do with love, but if you're looking for a heavy-hitting rocker, this song will be up your alley. Listen for Dave's haunting laugh near the end!<br /><br />\\"Lovetheme\\": The first of two instrumental tracks. DM got away from these for a while but started placing them on albums again with Ultra. This one's short and simple but provides for nice background music. Crank up the subwoofer for the opening beats!!!<br /><br />\\"Freelove\\": This is the third slow, gentle song featuring Dave on lead vocals. This is one of my favorites lyrically on the album. If you know of people who think of DM as a dark band with cynical lyrics, this song should change their perception (as will most on this album). It's a longer track, clocking in at over six minutes, mostly due to the lengthy instrumental parts. The catchy guitar from \\"When the Body Speaks\\" returnson this song.<br /><br />\\"Comatose\\": Martin sings this one. While it's not a bad song and Martin's vocals are excellent as usual, it's probably the weakest on the album from both a lyrical and musical standpoint. It's a bit too repetitive and underpowered in general to be a truly great song.<br /><br />\\"I Feel Loved\\": Ready for another curveball? This is an upbeat dance track with a heavy beat. Think dance club music here, not \\"I Feel You\\" or other earlier DM songs. The lyrics are simple, the music filled with loops, but this song turns out surprisingly good and is one of the highest points of the album. It's everything you'd least expect from Depeche Mode in one package. Dave's vocals are excellent here as well.<br /><br />\\"Breathe\\": DM returns to its roots on this one to some degree. This is another song with Martin on lead vocals and deals with something negative: rumors. Think of this as a modern, more mature, more organic, less repetitive version of \\"The Things You Said\\" from Music for the Masses with heartfelt lyrics. Martin delivers quite the vocal performance, showing the same passion present on \\"Home\\" from Ultra.<br /><br />\\"Easy Tiger\\": This is, hands-down, my favorite DM instrumental. The song sounds like something out of a movie, rather dark and foreboding in nature but not depressing. It's capable of painting vivid imagery in one's mind, no doubt due to its instrumentation and simple yet complex melody. The extended version from the special edition discs/online store compilations is definitely worth it.<br /><br />\\"I Am You\\": This is the most mainstream sounding track I've heard from DM in a while. While it's not as \\"happy\\" sounding as something from, say, NSync, it's something that would probably appeal to most NSync fans. There's some traditional DM lyrical devices in here, but this is, at the heart of it all, a great poppy love song with Dave's vocals as the icing on the cake. This happens to be another one of my personal favorites from the album.<br/><br />\\"Goodnight Lovers\\": The album closes with another DM oddity: a song in a major key (the overwhelming majority of DM songs are in minor keys). To sum up my feelings about the song: this is exactly what you'd sing to the girl who had a huge crush on you in middle school who you became good friends with in high school (yet you secretly liked her), then lost touch with during your college years. Suddenly, you're out of school and you rediscover each other/reconnect somehow, meet up somewhere, and realize you've been suffering all these years because nobody has come close to her. This song could practically be classified as easy listening; it's a very quiet, calming track. Yes, this is another ballad with Dave on lead vocals!<br /><br />Nearly one hour later, this great album comes to a close. Although it was never the most popular DM album in the world and was overshadowed by newer, more marketable bands at the time of its release, this one is worth picking up even if you're not a DM fan (my pop-loving friends generally like this album even though they often gripe whenever I play my other DM albums).

0312641893|5.0|I am sucker for fairytale retellings. Throw in an original dystopian future, a kick-ass heroine, a handsome prince, cyborgs and you have a recipe for AWESOME. Cinder takes the traditional story of Cinderella and turns it on its head. Cinder, part cyborg and part human, is the best mechanic in town. Living as a second class citizen and forced to work to make money for her stepmother, Cinder dreams of a day when she can run away and live her own life. When her sister falls ill to a mysterious plague that's been terrorizing the country, Cinder finds herself in the midst of a battle that that could affect millions of lives.<br /><br />I could not put this book down! I read the entire thing in almost one sitting and afterwards was left wanting more. This fresh, exciting debut from Marissa Meyer has everything that I want in a book - a strong heroine, well developed secondary characters, a unique setting and world and a sweet and sexy romance. Cinder had all the trappings of the traditional Cinderella fairy tale but with a futuristic twist. Cinder's slipper is now a cyborg foot, her coach is a beat up car and her only friend is a hilarious android named Iko.<br /><br />My favorite part of the story was Cinder herself. Strong willed, stubborn, intelligent and loving, it's ironic that she is considered less than human because of her cyborg parts when she seems to have more compassion and humanity in her than most of the human. The romance was well done and believable. Even though Cinder and Prince Kai are attracted to each other, it's not insta-love. Their feelings grow as the get to know each other over the course of the book. The book also had some great villains. Audrey is perfectly cruel as the stepmother you love to hate. The Lunar Queen, cold and ruthless, gave me the chills.<br /><br />The story was fasted paced and fraught with tension. I figured out the plot twist early on but it didn't detract from the story at all. I was invested and engrossed every step of the way and the cliffhanger ending will have you begging for more.<br /><br />The next book in the series, Scarlet, doesn't come out until 2013. :( Until then, there's the novella prequel, Glitches, to keep me busy.ay and the cliffhanger ending will have you begging for more.<br /><br />The next book in the series, Scarlet, doesn't come out until 2013. :( Until then, there's the novella prequel, Glitches, to keep me busy.

B000056VJ7|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS CD.  I have never written an online review on any product before but I felt compelled to write one on this CD:<br /><br />I was excited to get Meatloaf's \\"remastered\\" \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" in the mail but when I played it the first time I was sorely disappointed.  I have heard this music in it's original form many times, and it is amazing, but this remastered version seems to have upped the bass element to a point that I developed listener fatigue halfway through the first (title) cut.  I tried adjusting the bass on my stereo (yes a real stereo, not an I-home or Bose) but along with bringing the bass in line it destroyed the rich tones of Meatloaf's vocals.<br /><br />My next purchase will be the same album only from a used un-remastered 1980's CD (if such a thing exists) or to dig out the old turntable and buy a 1970's vinyl version at a rummage sale and hope it's not too scratched up.  It's sad state of affairs!

B002NXSSBU|5.0|I am not a \\"Hoffmanite\\", but I do have a really good sound system with HDCD capability. I own the LP, the Dennis Drake remastered CD, the Japanese SHM-CD, and just received the Audio Fidelity gold CD from Acoustic Sounds (through Amazon). I was so impressed with the James Taylor remasters from AF, I decided to take a chance on this version of \\"Never A Dull Moment\\" (which has been trashed by some reviewers) hoping for the high quality audio I expected to get with the SHM-CD which set me back $50! All I want to say is that this version is the best sounding version that I own, and I'm glad I bought it.

B001DPHDCY|5.0|\\"A person's a person, no matter how small.\\"<br /><br />Heh.<br /><br />I don't know if the filmmakers intended it, but this movie has a strong pro-life message, albeit somewhat hidden: Just because you can't see him or her yet, it doesn't mean the fetus is not a person.<br /><br />Otherwise we eventually arrive at the position that some \\"experts\\" have: \\"Parents should be allowed to have their newborn babies killed because they are \\"morally irrelevant\\" and ending their lives is no different to abortion, a group of medical ethicists linked to Oxford University has argued.\\" And they're right - if abortion is OK, then killing newborns is also OK. There's no rational stopping point, as they argue.<br /><br />\\"The authors therefore concluded that \\"what we call `after-birth abortion' (killing a newborn) should be permissible in all the cases where abortion is, including cases where the newborn is not disabled\\".\\" Some \\"bioethicists\\" like Peter Singer think we should be able to kill a child up to two years old.<br /><br />This movie's subliminal message - he who has ears, let him hear - is that this view is hideously wrong.<br /><br />The plot has been nicely updated, with great animation and humor, all in Seuss's well-known style. And understanding the central message only serves to increase your enjoyment of this movie.

B0077DBZXO|3.0|The first thing that struck me is the many references to Puss being a great lover and hints of him sleeping around. Kind of odd for what I thought was a family movie. Must be trying to appeal to the adults, but there must have been better ways.<br /><br />That's a shame, because the rest is quite entertaining, especially how the movie makes fun of Puss himself - chasing reflected light, lapping up his leche, etc.<br /><br />It's a story about friendship, disappointment, and redemption, with some scary villains (Jack and Jill). It's also genuinely touching.<br /><br />Some of the sequences (such as the dance-off) could have been much shorter, but that's a quibble. The plot and characters, especially Humpty's motivations, once revealed, turn out to be a bit more complex than you might expect, too, with adult themes (Jill is pressuring Jack to have a baby, for example; a character dies (or not?) in the end, and then ... what???). The golden goose looks a little demented - was that intended? Probably.<br /><br />We were trying to guess who voiced Humpty. He did a great job, and it was a surprise to find out who he was, in the credits.<br /><br />So, worth a watch, with the above caveats. I'd give it 3.5 stars.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought the Turtle Beach X41 as a replacement for my Tritton AX720 that I had since November 2010.  Originally I was looking for another wired set but wanted to try something other than the Trittons.  You hear so many mixed reviews about both Tritton and Turtle Beach but know you typically will see a complaint reported more than a praise.  When a product fails or is just not very good, I think more people are inclined to let others know how they feel.  I honestly had no issues with my AX720, other than the mic breaking.<br /><br />I was very skeptical about buying the TB X41, because of the reports of hissing and popping and overall Wifi interference.  Not 2 days since the mic on my Tritton's broke (internally came loose and failed in my repair) the X41's were a lightning deal, so I had to pull the trigger.  Ever since I finalized the purchase I was researching the issues concerning Wifi interference.  It actually didn't look good for me as my wireless router is right next to the TV, cable box, and 360.  My gaming is wired and I use the wireless for the PC which is in another room.<br /><br />Before setting up the new headset I repositioned the router, so it and the X41 base would be on opposite ends of the TV table (probably about 2 feet apart).  I have a DLink DIR 625 and I hear that wireless N likes to hog the 2.4ghz spectrum.  I'm not super Wifi savvy so I'm not sure if that's accurate.  Regardless, I experimented with making a couple of recommended changes in my router settings.  I ended up just forcing the router to channel 1.  I was going to change the channel width to 20Mhz but it didn't get a strong enough signal to the PC.<br /><br />I used the headset for about 2 hours last night.  About an hour in I turned on the PC to see if there would be any Wifi interference.  I didn't notice any issues.  The range, which I wasn't too concerned about, ended up being a lot longer than I expected.  I made it to the computer in the other room when it finally started fading in and out with static.  Also, the whole time I had my phone next to me which also uses the Wifi and a baby monitor turned on about 10 ft behind me.<br /><br />The audio clarity was awesome!  Actually, it sounded a little \\"cleaner\\" than my AX720s (not sure how else to describe it).  Maybe that was just because I was use to one over the other and this was something new, but regardless they sounded great.<br /><br />The mic feedback also had me a bit worried but in reading many reviews heard that this didn't typically bother people.  I actually love it!  It's subtle enough, and definitely lets you know if you are muted or not.  I was worried it was going to be like when you can hear yourself on the phone, but it's nothing like that.<br /><br />The construction seems solid, but being so light (which is good) they feel fragile.  Very comfortable to wear, and I'm sure I'll be keeping these away from the kids just in case.<br /><br />So far I love them.  If I have any problems I'll be sure to update my review.<br /><br />Edit: So after about a month of use I have only experienced one bad round of popping and cracking.  That was from our microwave.. It wasn't enough to change my score as the microwave is completely in my control and it screws up all wireless crap in my house anyways (phone and computer on WIFI) :) There is still no issues with having it so close to my router.  Occasionally I will hear a pop if I'm using my phone between matches, but nothing has ruined my actual gaming experience since I'm not using my phone WIFI aggressively while playing. Since it's an Android with sync turned on it is constantly using the WIFI, but no problems with that as per my original test.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book's plot was good. The character development makes you want to quit your day job and hope to be as good a writer as Suzanne--fantasy wise. The story seemed plausible with the juxtaposition of the bestiality that characterized the human populace in the early centuries (think Gladiator) and the technology advancement of our present and foreseeable future albeit at it's most rudimentary level. What I found most worrisome was the constant commentary about being hungry by the protagonist. I know it is called \\"the hunger games\\" but the food talk became overbearing. I am yet to find a book where the title indeed was the theme for an inordinate amount of the book. It disengaged me mostly during those episodical food ramblings by the protagonist and I found myself skipping paragraphs just to get to the core of the story and the ending particularly. I praise her careful consideration of what our race, or what we know to be our most evolved species is capable of doing pre- and post- the apocalypse. Which says more about our most mundane and primal inclinations bordered on evil. Look around you today and the world portrayed in \\"Hunger games\\" is not a fantastical one. It could be a world you will find yourself in. In fact, the more the years pass, the more sophisticated we will be at finding ways to amuse ourselves, at the expense of humanity.<br /><br />  Anyways, since I am not necessarily commenting as a 7th Grader for a class grade, I will stop short at, saying, but for all the hunger and food talk, the plot, story-line and suspense is just right there. Not that climactic but will give you cause to introspect.

B002I9Z8I0|3.0|There are a lot of rediculous little changes in this they do not mention to tell youa bout as if completely ignoring any star trek fans from the 80s and 90s era.<br /><br />What really bothered me is they force you to watch that ... jj abrams movie trailer on every single damn disc. What of the fans who do not care to see that and hated the new movie?<br /><br />Also that movie is so far gone where no man has gone before it should not even be linked to the original star trek series or movies I-VI.<br /><br />Anyway point is, I was very very dissapointed with the rush job they did on the sound effects and visuals.<br />Its very buffled, some parts are hard to hear and visually the whole movies look like they were in the dark during most scenes.<br /><br />I actually prefer the dvd releases.<br /><br />Just to add to that, the dvd releases had many edits as well from the vhs versions..mainly screen aspect ratios and little touch ups and removing clips. Thats right they removed a lot of clips . Little things you notice having watched the vhs version for so many years before dvd came out and you decided to invest in it.<br /><br />I'm not some small town hillbilly but I think its not fair to force changes on people. So anyway to conclude here, I bought this box set and did not get past the third movie... the visuals like I said and sound very very off for some reason and also not even that great for blue ray quality.  and yes the jj abrams trailer on every disc really really bothered me.<br />Glad I kept my dvd's and actually regret donating my vhs so I could compare the screen shots. but dvd is fine I guess.<br /><br />As far as special features go there are a lot. I have not compared them to the dvd specials, or if star trek the motion picture on this blue ray is the extended one with changed music or not.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought the Fiio e6 recently and it is my first headphone amplifier. I always loved the resonating sound that my Monster Turbine Coppers give me but I wanted to give them a little more juice without breaking the bank. Checked into the Fiio e5 and the e6. After numerous reviews I decided to spend an extra $10 and go with the \\"better\\" of the two amps. Box comes in and its pretty straight forward. You un-box it, let it charge, then switch to your desired EQ and you're good to go. I immediately noticed a gain in volume as well as all areas such as the lows, mids, and somewhat the highs....all without sounding over-distorted or over-bearing. Fast Forward to two months later, I'm sitting at my computer and listening to my Copper Turbines and wondering why I'm not feeling my music like I usually am, then it hits me how amazing this amp is after you get so used to it. Now I'm here writing this review to say that if you're on the fence on getting an headphone amp to improve your music with your low impedance headphones then spend the 30 bucks it's totally worth it. Definitely going to upgrade to a e11 or e17 down the road as soon as I can get a good pair of cans =D.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL NOTES: I'm NOT using the Fiio line out dock for this which would probably improve the audio quality that much more. The portability and lightweight of the amp is just too ideal for putting in your pocket or traveling with. Battery life is more than substantial for long sessions of listening for at least 10 hours or more. The two cables the device come with are built solid and aren't no bottom of the crate cables you'd think you'd find with a device this cheap.<br /><br />Hope this helped!

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This is the first time I have ever read a book by Stephen King.  I am not a fan of horror books.  This book was recommended to me by a friend. It is not a horror story.  I thought this book was great.  It grabbed my attention and interest from the very beginning and I did not want to put it down.  Stephen King is a terrific story teller and I hope he writes more books that are not scary/horror.  I loved the story and theme of this book and the time period the main character traveled back to was an era I grew up in.  I was in high school when John F. Kennedy was shot and killed. The story is pure fantasy but it was engaging and interesting.  If you have never read Stephen King before because you are not a fan of horror books, I highly recommend this book as an introduction to the great story telling of Stephen King.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This product is the exact same as [[ASIN:B000SMWUPS Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy]], the company changed names, and this just has the new name on it. It was well-reviewed before, and will still be.<br /><br />I bought this for use on the [[ASIN:B004RKOC3U Mutsy Mutsy Easyrider Umbrella Stroller, Black]], and it fits beautifully! It does not interfere with the folding, recline, or canopy! I love that the cup holder part easily holds a small plastic water bottle, a cup of coffee, or a giant sippy cup with ease. It stretches to fit the container. There is a small mesh pocket in the center section that is very nice, and the rest of the middle part is open.<br /><br />This product is sturdy, but can be left on when the stroller is folded. I love it! It's exactly what I needed!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Got a copy of Ash's Running Lean through an AppSumo offer while it was still beta. Easy to read, easy to understand, no useless trash-writing, simply lean. I liked it much and felt motivated to try the concept out. \\"Why not? Ash's tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it takes me two hours max to map my idea to the lean canvas. Let's do it!\\" - I said to myself. Well, after two weeks I was still struggling to finish my first canvas. Then I realized: lean concept looks simple and neat but it's just the result you see, the surface of the iceberg. The real work is hidden beneath and takes time to develop, to evolve. And it's pretty hard, because you are forced to give up the exciting yeah-that's-gonna-make-it thinking of your creative part and face the real world instead aka \\"test results or it didn't happen\\". But that's fun, actually - I'm finally through with the canvases, hypothesises and interview scripts. Now I'm wondering how many of my assumptions will be mercilessly shot down by the interviewees and what I can learn from them.
B005CYLSW8|3.0|Unlike most reviewers, I can't summon a great deal of enthusiasm for this new \\"updated\\" set of Beethoven symphonies. Chailly has nothing significant to say beyond what Rattle, Abbado, and Haitink attempted in their very similar cycles - chailly's Beethoven is striking enough as fast, extroverted music-making without any intention, apparently, of searching for depth. I liked his way with the lighter symphonies (no. 1, 2, 4, and 8) on first hearing feeling that Chailly had found more energy and conviction in Leipzig than he had, especially towards the end, in Amsterdam. But I turned vaguely depressed and unsatisfied as I kept listening. The Eroica and the Fifth fell into the now familiar pattern of zippy tempos, punchy attacks, minimal vibrato, etc. The breaking point came with the \\"Pastorale,\\" where Beethoven's nature worship leading to the redemptive, hymn-like finale is rattled off without the slightest charm or tenderness, much less reverence.<br /><br />There is no special reason to extol Chailly over his rivals; even the punchiness that sounds arbitrary and aggressive is an echo of Harnoncourt's approach. For a great many conductors Beethoven needs to be \\"refreshed\\" because the music says nothing to them. Cleaning an old painting can  beneficial, but that's not what great music needs, since performance is a re-creative art that starts from zero with the first bar every time a piece is played. glib, efficient run-throughs aren't cleaning away yellow varnish; they are scraping off traditions that mean something.<br /><br />I can accept that styles move on, but it bothers me when Beethoven is no longer a vehicle for the ideals that connect the Renaissance with the Romantic era. Beethoven intended to be inspiring, heroic, defiant, humanistic, and revolutionary. Happily, we've gotten past the either/or choice between HIP dogma and Romantic -tinged expressivity. What counts in a great Beethoven conductor is insight, depth of feeling, innate talent, and the potential that lies hidden beneath black notation on a page. The fact that modernism rejected idealism naturally implies that old music must be poured into new bottles. I have no wish to cling to a raft out at sea as the ship sails on, but I hear little of Beethoven's real depth in these performances.hat lies hidden beneath black notation on a page.

B004P4S4NM|5.0|Must admit I am late to the Adele party.  When \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" first came out, I liked the song and I loved hearing this \\"different\\", almost raspy voice that she has.  Then a month later I was sick of her.  Tired of hearing \\"Rolling In the Deep\\" play on EVERY damn radio station EVERY 10 minutes.  I hated on Adele a lot because of this because I was so sick of hearing the song.  No way in hell was I going to buy her cd.<br /><br />After she won all the grammys, I figured what the hell I'll give her a chance.  Wow I am completely blown away at how good this cd is.  Makes me kick myself for not getting it earlier and feeling like I jumped on the bandwagon.  The WHOLE cd is amazing, and it's very rare for me to buy a cd and not have to fast forward through a song.  Not only is her voice fantastic, but the production of the music is incredible too.  I am normally an R&B and Hip-Hop fan but this cd is a MUST BUY for any fan of music.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Best tool I have ever found for time and task management. When sync to the on-line version becomes available it will be 5 stars+. Can also sync to outlook on the on-line side so theoretically, it will then sync down to your android device.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Was very pleased with my purchase.  Received it on time.  I'm enjoying my product.  Would certainly shop at Amazon again.
1847879071|3.0|Shipping was fast and right on time, which is very important to me. Although, the book was supposed to come with an SPSS CD for statistics for research data and the SPSS CD was NOT included. This was an issue because I can not do my work in class with out this program. I am quite disappointed and would have not ordered the book if I couldn't have gotten the SPSS CD. This was a purchase of a NEW book, so I am not sure why it did not come with the SPSS CD.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Like many other reviewers have said, I LOVE this little app. I admit to being completely lame at gaming, but this one was different--and I got it! The graphics are great, and this is just a fun, cute game.<br /><br />While I can't really add anything to the reviews left by others, I am hoping that by adding to the number of positive reviews, this will get developers to come up with similar games--and very soon. I want more! Please!!
B006FECANK|5.0|I love this show and there is enough going on that the option to watch it as many times as I like is great!  I have watched it on my Kindle and my laptop.  I wanted to share it with my family and should have been able to through my husband's new phone connected to our TV but is wouldn't stream through the phone.  Haven't figured out the problem with that yet.
B004XNPQUO|2.0|This game has an interesting concept. You slingshot your projectile shot in an orbital pattern (that's affected by gravity) to blow up enemies, and trying to figure out the physics of how gravity affects your moves is an enjoyable cerebral exercise.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, there are some questions about how secure this app is. What is \\"sticky intent\\"? These are broadcasts whose data is held by the system after being finished, so that clients can quickly retrieve the data without having to wait for the next broadcast. Also, this game wants Adobe Air to open network sockets, which has been described as opening a backdoor into your device.<br /><br />Summary: The premise of this game is good, and somewhat novel in comparison to others in the App Store. Those who are concerned about security leaks from their device will probably not want to download this game, even though it's free today.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|my kids loved this game!!:-) Thanks for the free app!!!!!!!! Very educational. Helpful for both my 5 year old &amp; my 3 year old.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app helps me.organize my projects.  I would like to have the option to add a note to more than one notebook.
B0067D7Y3U|5.0|Daughtry is the best. He has out done himself with this album. I love it. He is the best. Will buy more music.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoying playing this when I am winding down from work in the evenings.  It is lots of fun.  I like starting from where I left off the previous night.  I highly recommend this game.
B0011Z77OK|4.0|I'm going to be honest here... I love this album. It's got all of my favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers songs on it and more! My only complaint about it is that the audio could be a little better, especially when I've heard better quality on their original albums. Regardless, this album is seconded only to my Nirvana  20th Anniversary of Nevermind Deluxe album in terms of how much I enjoyed it.<br /><br />In short, Red Hot Chili Peppers: Greatest Hits [Explicit] is an album not without flaws, but if you're looking for a collection of all your favorite classic RHCP songs in one then you should definitely purchase this. I did, and I haven't looked back since.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Excellent DVD. Professionally executed. Visual scans, closeups, audio make for a personal experience of an unusually intimate and passionate and loving performance. Of 50 DVD concerts, this is my favorite
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Don't even start reading this book if you don't want to be sucked in to finishing it because that is what happened to me!  My grandaughter, age 11, read all 3 of the books and cannot wait for the movie to come out.  So I just casually read what it was about and nearly dropped dead from the violence thinking I had no interest in reading a book of this type and knew this was not her normal reading material either. I just couldn't understand what was so good about this book...until she started reading to me!  Of course, I was then hooked and had to download my own book and finish it.  Yes, it is very violent and I did have a hard time going to sleep after reading it; definitely not a \\"warm fuzzy read\\". I did hate the fact that the book did not have a final conclusion and you have to read the next book in the series. It is kind of like a scary movie (which I do not watch at all anymore), you want to get a peek and see what is going on but not read all the graphic detail.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Amidst those who think Whitney Houston wrecked her voice let me register a dissenting opinion. I like her later work better than her earlier stuff. I think it is so soulfull and so deep, things that a younger singer never is. Her singing register has shifted a bit but that is inconsequntial. Nobody else could ever sing like this, in whatever register. I am not a fan of pop music in general or pop divas in particular and generally don't listen to other singers considered her peers. To me there are artists who transcend their genre, whatever it may be, and Whitney Houston is one of them. She has so much taste and so much subtle artistry in how she uses her voice, there just is no one else in her league. If you can really hear what a singer is doing and really hear the amazing things she is doing here then you will love this album. She doesn't need to blow you away with a big ending, for example- she can blow you away in the middle of a song and then take down the ending so you can barely hear it and you will be hanging on every note. When the truth of a person is in the music you are listening to one of the great ones- this cd is like that.
B004XNPQUO|5.0|Adobe Air is NOT necessary, either, btw. I don't have it installed & it still works perfectly fine. I don't even like shooters & I really liked this. It's the type where there are planets, & the planets' gravity affects where your ammo goes. Figured I'd be bored with it, but ended up spending quite a while playing it. Looks nice, plays nice, & kept my interest. If you're a fan of shooting games, you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />To the two grumpers complaining about games being for kids, & not intelligent, wealthy adults....well, I'm an adult, & I want games! That's why they give us a variety of apps AND games. There are plenty of us adults who are also intelligent, went to college, & have great jobs, who love games! Heck, the main reason I spent so much on a phone like this is so I can play games on it. They aren't just for kids, (what a stupid thing to say,) & for someone to say they are, I have to assume you're either very old or very boring.

B0052U59F4|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was by far one of the best books I have ever read. You will not be able to put it down and you will fall head over heels in love with Christian Grey. This book makes you laugh, cry, blush, and gives you butterflies while reading about Ana and Christian's journey. A MUST READ!!!!!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book at first. I try not to go for the books that have been splashed all over the headlines because they seem to be put \\"on ice.\\" But I was pleasantly surprised. This book is a page-turner; I couldn't put it down. It was my intention to read this book (#1 in the series) and move along to another book. However, after reading this one, I wanted to know more about the characters. And about the characters--they are well-developed. When reading, I was able to develop a picture of them, their personalities (and quirks), their appearances, their mannerisms, etc. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read!

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a pretty decent little sharpener.<br />Now you may run into slight difficulties sharpening larger blades, such as my machete, but only because it's difficult to keep it at the correct angle during the sharpening.<br />The stones fit probably just about any blade, not sure about such as axes, but other things, yea.<br />I think i paid about 8 bucks, and I also like the serrated blade sharpener thing that folds out. over a year and still going, but I dont quite sharpen stuff everyday, so...yeah, good item and price, overall
1594203334|3.0|I was entertained and amused by Pam Druckerman's book, Bringing Up Bebe: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting. Druckerman presents her personal story of raising children in France. Working like an anthropologist as a participant-observer of the culture, she is able to call attention to the differences she saw in how French parents behaved with their children as compared to many American parents. Among the many differences she presents are the approaches to patience and waiting rather than leaping in, and the ways in which autonomy is encouraged. No one parent's experience or observation is ever definitive for another parent's behavior, so those readers expecting a how-to manual will be disappointed. Readers who enjoy lively writing about family life across cultures will find this book interesting.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B0000E6XH3|5.0|One of the best animated music dvds I've ever seen.<br />Also, the ladies love it. just sayin'<br />Get it if you like daft punk, and especially if you havent seen it.
0596007124|5.0|I purchased this book about a year ago and devoted a number of hours each week going through it.  I am a software developer by trade, but never took a computer science course in my life, mostly because I was self-taught as a kid and all of this pre-dated the Web by about 20 years.<br /><br />In any event, one area where I knew I was lacking was a formal understanding of design patterns.  I was in the middle of a fairly large enterprise application, and while I was fully versed in Object Oriented Programming (and had even taught it in the past), I realized that everyone we were hiring out of college \\"spoke\\" a different language than I did, talking about singletons, factories, MVC, etc.<br /><br />This book covers those and many, many more, in a completely involving and revolutionary way.  It's basically designed with the Java language in mind, but I'm a .Net developer, never having learned Java.  However, the book is so thorough and intuitive, that I decided to do all of the examples in C# (close enough to Java that in many cases, there's almost a 1-to-1 relationship between my home-grown example and the one in the book.<br /><br />So for me, the book's benefit was two-fold: exposure to both design patterns and the Java language.  In many cases, I was able to \\".Net-ify\\" the examples to take advantage of specific features of .Net.  A good example was in the Observer pattern where you have an object that changes over time, and other objects (\\"observers\\") need to be aware of this change.  The book presents a language-agnostic approach, where the observable object registers all of its observers, and cycles through them notifying each one that it has changed.  With .Net, it's much easier (and more appropriate) to implement this using events, where the observable object doesn't care who's watching, it just announces \\"I've changed!\\" and each observer can then decide how to handle that event.<br /><br />But I digress... ultimately, I just threw myself into this book, doing every example as written, and then modifying those examples to function with the .Net mentality.  I even did all the pencil exercises, puzzles, etc.  It's all part of the learning process, right?<br /><br />So, in a nutshell, if you need to learn design patterns, get this book.  It's a lot of fun, and chock full of great information and examples that you'll be able to apply to your own projects right away.
0307949435|5.0|I just bought three books to send to my three fat siblings.  Our mother was right when she told us that if we ate starches we would get fat!  But did we listen to her?  Of course not.  We listened to all the \\"experts\\" telling us to limit fat in our diet for health.  How can this information not be reaching the broader society when everyone has gotten more and more obese while eating \\"complex carbohydrates\\" and skinless chicken breasts?  This is a must read for anyone who is overweight or obese.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|Ash consistently has the most interesting things to say about the process of creating a new product and company. This book is full of insightful observations for entrepreneurs - what makes it stand out is that it is a very practical, almost step by step process, for things like customer development, lean canvas, lean startup, minimum viable product, etc. etc. Other books like Eric Ries 'The Lean Startup' are also great, but are more anecdotal and academic......

0316069906|4.0|Eating Animals was first written in 2009 by Jonathan Safran Foer. It was his third novel and extremely successful. Foer's motivation to uncover the truth about meat is commendable and puts his work above the peachiness of novels that are more \\"anti-meat\\" and pushing the vegetarian realm. In Storytelling, when Foer first mentions that his book is not a classic vegetarian novel. The reader is left with the question \\"well, then what is it?\\" and this drives the reader forward through the novel's first chapter to uncover this mystery. Foer emphasizes a deep-rooted point that has been mentioned in other material throughout the semester. This point focuses on advocating a philosophy or belief through the food that we eat. Forks over Knives emphasizes the individual health benefits and political realm of each bite of food, while Fast Food Nation says the people have the opportunity to vote with their forks. However, Foer is unique in the sense that he pushes morality over other material that has been covered thus far. He states \\"not responding is a response--we are equally responsible for what we don't do. In the case of animal slaughter, to throw your hands in the air is to wrap your fingers around a knife handle.\\" However, throughout the novel his tone is personal, relatable and less than preachy. He covers some of the biggest problems right off the bat - waste management, superbugs, and animal suffering.<br /> One of the ways he accomplishes this tone is through storytelling rather than blatant regurgitation of facts. In one section, he blatantly exposes the animal associated waste problem. He talks about the holding ponds or \\"lagoons\\" that hold excrement and compares it to humans, saying the CAFO situation was as \\"if every man, woman, and child in every city and town in all of California and Texas crapped and pissed in a huge open-air pit...all year round.\\" America is drowning in feces. It is paying a high toll for the animals that are eaten. The lack of a basic large scale animal sanitation system is compromising our own systems. The blow is only made worse by Foer's news of the EPA reporting over thirty-five thousand miles of waterways contaminated by this inadequacy, and essentially driven by our insatiable indifference for meat. Through this excerpts language and tone alone, Foer highlights his role as a messenger and concerned friend. He tells the story as a neighbor would tell a neighbor. A politician would not say pissed or crapped, but the reader welcomes the honesty behind the message, an honesty that has not been expressed by the news, government, or food organizations. No wonder Foer decided to write a book about the findings of as a concerned father, the results are horrifying.<br /> While he covers excrement in great detail, Foer brings it a step further with his story focusing on the molecular biology and pharmaceuticals of agriculture. While this was touched on in some detail in other course material, Foer highlights the scope of animal's antibiotic demand. Livestock demand nine times more antibiotics than humans, twenty-eight million pounds versus three million pounds. No wonder America is experiencing high rates of superbugs. It is almost as if we are purposefully breeding them though our animal system. He talks about how the case of fluoroquinolone use in chickens opened a can of worms that has led to fluoroquinolone resistance. What is the most frustrating part of all this? The fact that we have the evidence and the tools for change, yet inaction overwhelms. America's animal consumption system is broken, but it does not seem broken enough to initiate national dramatic change. What has to happen before the government and corporations decided to do something about this crisis? Does an animal-based flu epidemic have to come around and wipe out thousands of innocent people? Does a majority of the waterways have to become contaminated? If there was a number or percentage that could predict when an issue was deemed \\"important enough\\" for action, it would be nice to know it.<br /> Foer's moral emphasis on suffering was what really made his book stand out from Fast Food Nation, Omnivore's Dilemma, Diet for a Hot Planet, and others. His focus is strong, the message clear. Either you don't eat meat, or you support a lot of animal pain and suffering. He offers little wiggle room. It seems that this fierce (however unobtrusively delivered) stance, is what causes him to make Michael Pollan an antagonist in the book, right alongside corporate giants Tyson and Smithfield. Michael Pollan's view is mild in the sense that he qualifies eating meat. He believes, like many others, that if a farmer has raised a chicken in an ethical manner, than the act of eating the animal is the natural order of the food chain. This is a view I have held for most of my life. Why? It is easy and it assuages our conscience enough to make eating meat acceptable. Foer brings to light an interesting point in terms of sustainable meat farms, like Frank Reese's turkey farm. He promotes the work of this miniscule one percent of the meat industry, however with everything he says Foer goes against all meat consumption. Therefore, it is interesting to note the difficulty that these \\"ethical\\" meat farms face. On one hand there are huge corporate farms appealing to the indifference of the masses, on the other there is an extremely conscientious and ethical way of living that argues a vegetarian diet. It seems that the vegan and vegetarian movements are the extreme side of a debate that has little room for the middle man. He is somewhat contradictory when he states in reference to Frank's heritage turkey farm \\"my wager [is] on a vegetarian diet...and [I] support their kind of farming.\\" It is not the best solution since small farms like Frank's could in no way replace the commercial system now instilled. Plus, how are the meat factories going to become more sustainable if most of the people who would otherwise stand up for animals are not eating meat at all? This applicable to the real world situation is where I think Michael Pollan's view has some traction.<br /> The moral component of Foer's book showcases two situations. The section where Foer proposes eating dogs as a sustainable meat source provides compelling moral ground against all meat consumption. He writes \\"no reader of this book would tolerate someone swinging a pickax at a dog's face.\\" This imagery makes the connection between the animals a family knows and loves and the animals that are hidden in the food system. It is not hard to realize that the people and animals that humans form a connection with on daily basis are those that are treated with morality and care. Someone could form the parallel between our families and people dying from AIDS in third world countries. If those afflicted people were in the backyard or living nearby, they suddenly become real and demand a better treatment. This same situation applies to animals. Thereby, it is extremely affective for Foer to take what is familiar to the typical American and then to inject the meat industry's morality (or lack thereof). He highlights that it is indifference that drives the meat industry. American society is okay to have its dirty work done by others in order to keep the personal conscience clean. Why do we treat our pets with such care and love but not our meat sources? Foer does a good job of emphasizing the point that is not in the way we raise our meat but in the end result. Our choices need to be about what actually happens to the animal. His connection between household pets and cows makes me realize the severity of our moral decisions regarding meat consumption. The reality that cows are bled, dismembered, and skinned while conscious is inexcusable.<br /> Foer goes into detail about the conditions and execution of pigs, fish, and cows. There is a complete lack of respect and morality that follows them into death. The section where Foer sneaks into aCalifornia turkey farm with the animal rights activist reveals these conditions. This tale-telling section is one of the most important parts of the book in terms of Foer's relationship with his readers. In this section, Foer gives readers something that most news sources lack. He reveals truth. He puts the reader and himself on the same side of the divide and draws the line. I like that Foer also is able to connect the choice of the non-meat eater to the common suggestion that vegetarianism reflects an ultimate sentimentality or child-like innocence. When he brings up the two friends ordering lunch, this does a good job demonstrating that the non-meat eater is actually portraying a responsibility to his planet and the environment that the meat eater disregards on impulse. This made me see vegetarians in a new light and with more respect.<br /> One unique aspect of Foer's novel is choice that he has made regarding his format in presenting the situation. In a way, he talks about very serious issues yet brings to the table a fun and playful attitude with them. This is appealing to the readers in the sense that no one wants to be depressed or made to feel guilty. They want an entertaining trustful friend to lay down the views. Foer accomplishes that with his story-telling and constantly shifting writing style. I think it is interesting that Foer never talks about dairy and eggs as part of his animal-advocate stance. It seems that would be an important topic in talking about the ethics of animal treatment, as it happens that many animals are made to produce milk their whole lives by being made consistently pregnant.<br /> Foer's heart is in the right place with this novel. He seeks to be a good father for his children and to reveal some aspects of the agricultural world. I like that he ends with a turkey-less Thanksgiving and brings it all back to the theme with his grandmother. The story that she was able to survive of the scrapes of others in Europe is an extremely compelling way to start and end the novel. Foer's stance that we are defined by what we are willing to do without is important but I do not know if it includes many things. What is the willingness to exercise on a daily basis? That is not the action of doing without something but rather adopting a new behavior. I would argue 'doing without' is in fact taking action--one of the most powerful ones that a person of affluence in a western society can accomplish. I feel a major emphasize of this course is our willingness to abstain from excess and live towards a simple more earth-friendly way of living through our daily actions. It is indeed an exciting journey that Foer has helped through his contribution, Eating Animals.animals are not eating meat at all? This applicable to the real world situation is where I think Michael Pollan's view has some traction.<br /> The moral component of Foer's book showcases two situations. The section where Foer proposes eating dogs as a sustainable meat source provides compelling moral ground against all meat consumption.

Our choices need to be about what actually happens to the animal. His connection between household pets and cows makes me realize the severity of our moral decisions regarding meat consumption. The reality that cows are bled, dismembered, and skinned while conscious is inexcusable.<br /> Foer goes into detail about the conditions and execution of pigs, fish, and cows. There is a complete lack of respect and morality that follows them into death. The section where Foer sneaks into aCalifornia turkey farm with the animal rights activist reveals these conditions. This tale-telling section is one of the most important parts of the book in terms of Foer's relationship with his readers. In this section, Foer gives readers something that most news sources lack. He reveals truth. He puts the reader and himself on the same side of the divide and draws the line. I like that Foer also is able to connect the choice of the non-meat eater to the common suggestion that vegetarianism reflects an ultimate sentimentality or child-like innocence. When he brings up the two friends ordering lunch, this does a good job demonstrating that the non-meat eater is actually portraying a responsibility to his planet and the environment that the meat eater disregards on impulse. This made me see vegetarians in a new light and with more respect.<br /> One unique aspect of Foer's novel is choice that he has made regarding his format in presenting the situation. In a way, he talks about very serious issues yet brings to the table a fun and playful attitude with them. This is appealing to the readers in the sense that no one wants to be depressed or made to feel guilty. They want an entertaining trustful friend to lay down the views. Foer accomplishes that with his story-telling and constantly shifting writing style. I think it is interesting that Foer never talks about dairy and eggs as part of his animal-advocate stance. It seems that would be an important topic in talking about the ethics of animal treatment, as it happens that many animals are made to produce milk their whole lives by being made consistently pregnant.<br /> Foer's heart is in the right place with this novel. He seeks to be a good father for his children and to reveal some aspects of the agricultural world. I like that he ends with a turkey-less Thanksgiving and brings it all back to the theme with his grandmother. The story that she was able to survive of the scrapes of others in Europe is an extremely compelling way to start and end the novel. Foer's stance that we are defined by what we are willing to do without is important but I do not know if it includes many things. What is the willingness to exercise on a daily basis? That is not the action of doing without something but rather adopting a new behavior. I would argue 'doing without' is in fact taking action--one of the most powerful ones that a person of affluence in a western society can accomplish. I feel a major emphasize of this course is our willingness to abstain from excess and live towards a simple more earth-friendly way of living through our daily actions. It is indeed an exciting journey that Foer has helped through his contribution, Eating Animals.

B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Didn't like this game. Can't see what all the hipe is about. Took off \\"Kindle Fire\\" after a two wk.<br />trial period.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was not one for the whole romance thing between Pita and Katniss, and I did not need to see a happy ending. But instead the ending we got was boring and, I felt, left incomplete.<br />I enjoy the character Katniss. She was strong and yet she was never over the top. Which is why this book is so disappointing. It takes over have the book for something good to happen and when it does, its not that good. Katniss is closed up and most of the time I cannot stand her. Most things that happen are plain pointless or just stupid.<br />Collins either didn't care about this book or just wanted to get it over with, which is terrible because this was such a good series. But this is just my opinion and please do not let me make up your mind about this book.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This is just as challanging as the \\"Random Mahjong\\".  However find at times, will be in the middle of a game and it will close down and go back to home. Not sure what causes that, but find it madding. A good game to keep the brain cells sharp and the eye/hand cordination working without being overloaded.

B006M4F67A|5.0|A great game for the Kindle Fire. It is one of my favorite games and rates pretty well for a app game.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|Come on PopCap, you've had plenty of time to fix this. Either get this game working reliability on Ice Cream Sandwich devices or mark it as incompatible. An extremely buggy app is worse than no app at all.
B0070TDERU|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  It is so good.  I can't wait for season 3.  The characters are well-developed.  You love them and sometimes hate them in the same episode.  One of the best shows on TV
B0030V0PEW|5.0|I have tried to adopt the practical checklist methodology from this book. I started to use check list to get my everyday life better organized, seeing great results already. I have adopted in my engineering practice, getting great results as well.<br />One of the best books I have read, well written in concise language, well organized book structure. Research results are presented and referenced in rigorous form to back statements, conclusions about check list. (This is not one of these \\"expert\\" books where bold statements were made and only backed by anecdotal stories and speculations)<br />Looking forward to the next book from this author.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|awesome app. easy to use, have it on two devices. I really like the highlight function. I cant really wait for the niv version to be downloaded.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I bought this CD (it's 1 disc, not 2)for my wife last year, and just listened to it. It's ironic because Relix magazine just came out with an article regarding the 40th anniversary of Harvest being released. This concert took place shortly before Harvest came out . He previews several of the tunes. The sound quality is phenomenal! What's also cool is the crowd- they are absolutely silent during the songs, then break out into wild applause after each tune (it sounds like they're tearing the house down before the encore). He performs solo acoustic- either guitar or piano. The versions are strppied down and wonderful. His voice is superb. If you call yourself a Neal Young fan, you MUST have this CD.
1430308001|5.0|The cover and title is rather cheesy, but this is a very good tactics book.<br /><br />In my opinion, the main strenghts of the book are:<br /><br />1. The prose is very clear and easy to understand.<br /><br />2. It is very systematic and thorough, with A LOT of examples for each tactical motif. Also, I like the way the examples progress towards increasing difficulty/subtlety.<br /><br />The author has a website, chesstactics.org, where much of the material in the book is available for free. It's still worth picking up the books (there are two volumes in the series) for studying offline.<br /><br />The author doesn't list his chess merits or rating, so I assume he doesn't have a title. But this shouldn't influence your buying decision - if you are looking for a good tactics book, you should consider this one and its sequel.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the diagrams are a little small.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|An excellent book, and a good experience buying it. I recommend it. You will have a good time on it.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|This seemed like the fast forward version of the Pride and Prejudice story compared to the BBC's earlier version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. The lead actors in this version, though unquestionably attractive, lacked the depth of character known to the novel's ardent fans. I know Mr. Darcy is a snob, but Matthew Macfadyen never cracks a smile. It just felt like the story flew by with the actors running through their lines like they had to get somewhere fast; a directorial flaw I'm sure. On the other hand, Mr. Bennett's poorly articulated lines were impossible to understand without subtitles.<br /><br />I don't regret buying it at the $9.99 price just to have enjoyed the last scene, which, to give credit where it's due, and though a bit sugary, was more romantic than the BBC version. We wait ardently for Mr. Darcy to finally kiss his Elizabeth, and the BBC version left me longing for a more passionate visual effect. This one had a little more magic.
B005LZW9CG|3.0|I'm no sound engineer but I am very familiar with the Genesis catalogue in all its incarnations from vinyl to the 2007 remasters. Some of remasters along the way made a dramatic difference in sound quality and/or mix, especialy on the early Gabriel-era material. This Audio Fidelity remaster of HIMBG sounds good but after a few casual listenings on a decent audio system I can't detect much in the way of noticeable improvements.
B001HN690O|4.0|The movie is fun for young and old. I saw it in the theaters and had to have it for my own collection. I even liked it enough to buy it as a gift for a few people in my life. Kids will love it and there is enough to keep the adults in the room very entertained as well.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|this is my favorite game until the last update...it lost all of my game data.  This version does not have any of the features that the ios version has, it's the same as the Nintendo DS version.  Popcap has gotten lazy since EA games took them over.  Fix this game and make it right.

Carol King's \\"Tapestry\\" and Neil Young's \\"After the Goldrush\\" were released within a few months of each other during my senior year in high school (1970-1971). I credit them for providing the instructional development I needed at the time to write introversion-oriented lyrics that created a heart-felt connection with the listener. Thanks for the memories and inspiration. I highly recommend this CD.

0385534639|5.0|I am confused by some of the reviews where people stated they were left confused at the end. I have only 3-4 more pages to go and I understand the purpose of the competition and the way the book ended, or I should say is ending. Clearly people just skimmed through the end and didn't read it thoroughly.<br /><br />I loved how the author described rooms and what people were wearing and smells of the circus, everything. You can't help but imagine these amazing places in your head. And isn't that the point of books, that the fun of books versus movies? The author leaves it to your imagination to think of these places, people, sights and sounds. Would you rather hear she was wearing a black dress then turned to green or the way that the author elaborates on it and makes you imagine how it magically changes.<br /><br />I finished this book in a week and am sad to see it ending. I can only wait for the movie to come out, which I didn't know about until after I started reading these reviews. I hope it doesn't spoil the book by adding the Hollywood touch to it.<br /><br />Clearly this book is not for everyone, but I would give it 10 stars if I could. It's definitely for the person that love details and has a vivid imagination *raising hand.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|I was terrible in Chemistry/Physics/even Math, in high school--but I 'killed' the ACT composite without studying, due to my comprehension skills.  Back then PCs just weren't even real computers yet (I'm 43, that was 1986). So when I learned I loved working on/using computers, I felt 'challenged', until I had some successes, then really got into building my own HTPCs.  Now I do it all sorts of computer repairs, so I know good stuff.<br />This is good stuff.<br />My reason for mentioning chemistry is that I can't imagine the 'how', but the end result is that Arctic Silver's 'formula', whatever it looks like 'up close' (I'd guess an atomic microscope would do it justice), it does a better job than any 'white-paste' substitutes (just what they are).<br />For anybody balking at the 'price-tag' here, just download the (absolute) freeware called 'Speedfan', and test your current PC's internal temps as is, then open it up (or have somebody else do it, and watch what they do) and replace that nasty old cooling 'sealant' (I call it, it sets up so bad from its own heat)...then put it all back together, run 'Speedfan' again, and watch your PCs internal temps fall drastically.<br />I'm the cheapest person I know--I'm so cheap, I'm the guy who picks up actual furniture and uses it himself (coming soon to your neighborhood!)...<br />HOWEVER...when it matters, you gotta think, with 35 uses per tube, this stuff it worth every penny.  Just think of saving 35 PCs with it, and you'll begin to 'see the light'.<br />It's awesome--'Silver 5' being the '5 different' kinds of actual Ag molecules in it, is great and all, but the stuff just does a better job sealing, AND passing temperatures through what it's sealing, too!<br />If your 'PC Geek', 'Tech', or whatever does NOT use this, find somebody who does, and start using them for all your repairs.  If I sound like a sellout...I am.<br />But I'm the guy with a 100% success record, kick-butt HTPCs, and still cheap enough that the only household furnishings I brag over are the ones I find on the side of the road.<br />Really.  I'll stop now.old furnishings I brag over are the ones I find on the side of the road.<br />Really.  I'll stop now.

0380715430|5.0|The Mother Tongue, Bill Bryson  Bill Bryson is an American journalist who lives in England, worked for London newspapers, and wrote two other books. This 1990 book has 245 pages, a Select Bibliography, and an Index. This is an entertaining and educational book, but it may not be totally accurate. [The work OK is said to come from a West African language (p.165).]  Chapter 1 says English is &#34;full of booby traps for the unwary foreigner&#34; because of its complexities. English has become the most global of languages (p.12). The richness of English vocabulary allows shades of distinction not found in other languages (p.13). Other languages can make distinctions lacking in English (p.14). English is simpler (free of gender) and concise (p.19), but with jargon and complexity. Mankind can speak because of a descended larynx (Chapter 2). Many languages are descended from Indo-European over 9,000 years ago. Some died off (p.32). Chapter 3 notes the differences. English has a simpler grammar (p.35). The author notes many facts about languages. Chapter 4 tells about the changes in west European languages. The end of Roman rule in Britain resulted in the decline of the Celts (p.49). Old English did not have the silent letters or phonetic inconsistencies of modern English spelling (p.51). Changes around 1500 led to &#34;The most wildly unphonetic spellings of any language&#34; (p.61).  English retains the richest vocabulary and diverse meanings of any language (Chapter 5). Words are created by error, adopted from other languages, arise from nowhere, by changed meanings, or by adding prefixes or suffixes (p.75). English is the only language with so many words spelled the same way but pronounced differently (Chapter 6). The varieties of sounds varies geographically (Chapter 7). Pronunciation can signify class or background (p.106). English can be a very difficult language to spell correctly (Chapter 8). The Norman Conquest affected spelling (p.124). The printing press brought uniform spelling but preserved inconsistencies (p.126). It is a good thing there was never any academy to control the English language (Chapter 9). Meanings shift and change in response to common usage (p.145). Dictionary definitions often fail to convey the nuances of English (p.150).  Chapter 10 discusses dictionaries. New words became part of the vocabulary (Chapter 11). [Bryson doesn't mention the effects of radio towards uniform speech (p.169).] American usage affects English usage (p.175). How many people in the world speak English (Chapter 12)? An international language can reduce business costs (p.188). [The justification for Esperanto (p.191)?] Chapter 13 explains the history behind place names and family names. Chapter 14 discusses &#34;dirty words&#34;. Words once unacceptable are innocuous today (p.220). People play games with words (Chapter 15). Chapter 16 discusses the future of English in the US. What is causing &#34;declining educational standard&#34; (p.242)? Will British and American English become dissimilar (p.243)? Movies, television, books, magazines, record albums, etc. are influences that bind the countries together.
B0067LY4WG|3.0|OLD IDEAS, indeed. How about some melodies to offset the old man's wheeze? I am a longtime Cohen devotee. I understand he's \\"confronting his mortality,\\" but I'd prefer he follow Dylan (Thomas, not Bob) and rage against the dying of the light. His comic self-deprecation comes off as reverse smugness.

B003PJ6UHA|4.0|Great book. Well written. Interesting and thought-provoking topic. Very happy I purchased and read. Its only downfall is that it doesn't go quite far enough: \\"Ok, so nothing is real. What next?\\" The authors admit they deliberately left this for others to investigate, but then, that's why I didn't give it five stars. Otherwise, it's a fantastic concept and really worth the read.

0307957934|1.0|I am the most boring man in the world.  People recognize that I have the emotions of my computer algorithm.  I have been known to cause narcolepsy when I walk into a room.

B004XNPQUO|1.0|Couldn't get this app to run. Tried several times, only got a black screen. Very disappointed because I had high hopes for a fun, brain stimulating game. Reviewers, don't assume people who can't get the apps to work have an inferior phone, and don't assume they are idiots that can't check settings or close other programs. And don't put a review on here to counter the effect of a review you don't like or don't agree with. It's frustrating to have to scroll through and sort out the actual reviews from the junk.

B000A7DVR2|4.0|It's a rare movie for me that gets better with age, memory, and repeated viewings.  \\"Lebowski\\" is one of those movies.<br /><br />I first saw the film when it came out in theaters in 1998 and, while I enjoyed it then, I wasn't especially enamored.  Perhaps it was because I was young and didn't much dig the drug references.  Or maybe it was because I kept trying to follow the plot more than I did the characters - which would have been a mistake.  While this film certainly has a plot - and an overly elaborate one, at that - the plot really isn't the point; it exists primarily to serve (and display) the oversize characters.<br /><br />And, while it's taken me a little time to realize this point, realize it I did.  This film is really all about the idiosyncratic characters, the colorful dialogue, and the laid back vibe that Jeff Bridges (and, thus, the character of \\"The Dude\\") brings to the proceedings.  Those things hold the film together.<br /><br />A mild warning to some, based on a few complaints that I've encountered while reading the reviews: the dialogue is colorful, by which I mean that it is both funny and frequently profane.  The `F Word' gets dropped quite a few times throughout this flick, and - due to a couple of the plot threads - there are clear and explicit references to the adult film industry as well as frequent references to drug culture.  You don't need to be acquainted with either of those areas (I'm certainly not) to enjoy the flick, but if ya' *really* don't dig that kind of stuff - as in you have strong %&#@ moral objections to the material, man - then this movie probably isn't your kind of thing.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Bought this \\"used\\" from the amazon warehouse and it was in perfect condition!! Paid $10 less than a new one. The pink is more magenta than the picture provided. Fits snug on my kindle fire, protects it and I couldn't be happier!
B001U6YI92|5.0|Goodness me, this is a great movie.<br /><br />For a long time, I was torn over the question of whether this film or \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" was Leone's best work.  But you know what?  I decided that that question was pointless.  Both are stunningly photographed, both feature Ennio Morricone's brilliant scoring, and both are acted and directed to within an inch of the lives of everyone involved.<br /><br />This film is continuously, stupendously, entertaining. The script lifts whole elements from earlier Westerns and adventures but threads them through with elements of visual satire and a fine, rough humor rarely seen in the works of John Ford. And perhaps that humor is the key difference between this film and Leone's later masterpiece: \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is a deliberate and sometimes serious meditation on and homage to the traditions of the Western. \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,\\" however, while also a work of art, is far more interested in providing hugely entertaining satire and blazing western action.<br /><br />Plus, it has Eli Wallach's perfomance as Tuco. Has ever a character been more fun, more irascible yet sympathetic, and more endlessly quotable?<br /><br />As a brief technical note: I'm definitely a Blu-ray layman, but this Blu-ray disc looks and sounds great.  I'm happy.

B0051HNMTI|4.0|Well, maybe not a fatal flaw, but still something that would have given this 5 stars. The demo videos are great. The exercise collection is great. The wealth of options are great. BUT, it would have been &uuml;ber great (did I really just write that?!?) if the instructor COUNTED out the exercises! Unless you figure out a way to rig your smartphone to your head so it is always in front of you or otherwise suspend it in front of your face as you lay on the ground, there is really not much regulation in the repetition of each exercise. Sure, when you become familiar with the exercises you can count them out yourself and develop a rhythm, but for people just starting out, it would have really helped. Perhaps they will make that a new feature in the future. Other than that, very good app. The 'trainer' is really hot, too. Nice eye candy.

B0073LWEXK|4.0|if you're looking for a challenging game ,this is a great game on the fire.this was my first time playing a game like this so I used the hint guide more than I wanted but definitely worth the 1.99 . it's a game you&quot;ll play more then once.you&quot;ll start to understand it better everytime you play.The graphics are great!!!eventhough the game is to difficult for my 3 yr old,he enjoyed just watching !  before I knew it I was talking to him about where I needed to navigate :)<br /><br />  only con is that when you use the hint guide as much as i did ,I noticed i was a little irritated by having to scroll through it every time and find where I'd left off .
B0051HNMTI|4.0|As a workout app, I am very happy with this. The design of the workouts and the exercises are both very good. A few adjustments should be made, however, including volume control (it currently has only on and off) and better optimization for tablets like the Kindle Fire. The video is good, but could take up more of the screen, and the text is too small. Thanks, dev!

B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Kindle Fire compatible ...and awesome on the 7&quot; screen.<br /><br />I didn't think that this game would be so good. I downloaded it expecting a space invaders rip off but from the beginning credits I could see how beautiful it would be.  when I started gameplay I expected choppy handling but I did not get that.  Instead I was welcomed with an easy to manuveur ship, multiple weapon choices, a bunch of upgrades for those weapons, level after level of awesomeness and a kooky storyline that has fun with the classic game. overall this is a great app that you should own.<br /><br />Though I give it 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 because there is no clear explanation of the weapon usage or what the upgrade packages consist of.

B000VFGQUC|4.0|The two disc DVD/CD set Live And Dangerous is a must have for fans of the pioneering hard rock band Thin Lizzy.  The DVD contains two live performances of the band, video clips, and interviews with the surviving members.  The second disc is a CD containing newly discovered live material from 1975.<br /><br />Although Thin Lizzy had various members, this collection focuses on the \\"classic\\" mid 70's lineup consisting of the late Phil Lynott (1949-1986) on bass, drummer Brian Downey, and twin lead guitarists Robbie \\"Robbo\\" Robertson, and Scott Gorham.  This version of Lizzy recorded the album [[ASIN:B000001F9E Jailbreak]] (1976), containing their breakthrough hit The Boys Are Back In Town.<br /><br />The main feature entitled Live And Dangerous at the Rainbow 78, was recorded in 1978 at the Rainbow Theater in London, and features the classic Lizzy lineup for what would turn out to be one of the last times, as Brian Robertson would soon fall out of favor, and be fired from the band.  Musically the performance is significant, as it captures this group at or near their peak, and clearly demonstrates Lizzy's ability to rock as hard as anyone.  Phil Lynott was a huge physically imposing guy, who dominated the center of the stage, flanked by Robertson on his right, the red clad Scott Gorham on his left, and with drummer Brian Downey very close behind.  These were some tough lads, not to be messed with.<br /><br />The video Live And Dangerous is great to have, but is kind of a disappointment in a couple of key areas.  The performance features 11 songs and runs about 51 minutes.  The CD version of [[ASIN:B000002KIT Live & Dangerous]] includes performances recorded in other cities, and has 17 songs, and runs about 75 minutes.  One might hope that more live video from the Rainbow is available, but apparently this is not the case.  Another issue with the concert video, is the jumbled order of the tracks.  The result is an abridged disjointed performance, that isn't a very accurate representation of Thin Lizzy live.<br /><br />In addition, the performance is not captured particularly well on video.  The stage isn't spacious, so the members are often close to each other.  The crowd is at the foot of the stage, and there are no camera operators directly in front at floor level.  Most of the views are shot from cameras at the sides of the stage, back by the drum kit, and elevated above the crowd at the front.  Camera coverage and editing reflects an older style, and isn't the best.  The camera operator on Robertson's side manages to nicely capture several of his solos, but the camera on Scott Gorham's side is out of position, so unfortunately when he solos, you mostly see Gorham's back and side.  Sharpness is acceptable but wavers at times.  Image quality is decent, but not great.  The audio mix often seems muddled and unclear, with inconsistent tonal quality.<br /><br />While the far from optimal, this is still a very enjoyable performance, for what it is.  You certainly get a feel for the power and energy of the band, and the magnetism and appeal of Phil Lynott, is evident even decades later.  Twin lead guitar players are nothing special today, but back in the mid-70's Robertson and Gorham, where among the trailblazers of this trend in hard rock.<br /><br />Disc One also contains an eight song, 45 minute performance recorded in 1983 called Sight And Sound In Concert.  This version of Thin Lizzy features ex-Tygers of Pan Tang guitarist John Sykes (Blue Murder, Whitesnake) teamed with Gorham, and Darren Wharton on keyboards.  This was apparently the band's first live performance after having recorded the album [[ASIN:B00005Y2EM Thunder & Lightning]] (1983).  Both on that album and here live, it is clear that Sykes pyrotechnic playing ability, brings a new fire and aggressive edge to the band.<br /><br />Although once again the camera work and editing is not the greatest, and the audio mix seems to lose one of the guitars at various times, froma performance standpoint, this is an absolutely killer show.  Commanding the stage, Phil Lynott is great as usual.  No doubt feeling some pressure, Scott Gorham steps up his level of playing.  Newcomer Sykes delivers big time, incorporating some flash into his playing, effortlessly duplicating his solos from the record, as Lizzy performs several songs from the new album.  This dynamic performance is a joy to watch, but alas much too brief.<br /><br />Rounding out the extras are several appearances on Top Of The Pops, the British equivalent of American Bandstand.  And a 45 minute interview which features Downey, Robertson, and Gorham recorded separately, and edited to form a fairly cohesive and comprehensive retrospective of the band, the music, and remembrances of Phil Lynott.<br /><br />Disc 2 is a CD containing Live At Derby, a recording of seven songs recorded in 1975.  The sound is a little raw and unpolished, but the guitar playing is very tight, and the music is worth listening to.<br /><br />Calling this DVD set Live And Dangerous, and using the same cover art as the album/CD, may not have been the wisest decision, as it leads one to believe that the music on the CD is also on the DVD, which isn't completely true.  Amazon currently regards the CD and DVD as the same product, which is completely wrong.<br /><br />Although it may be imperfect, the Live And Dangerous DVD is worth seeing.  Thin Lizzy was one of the pioneers of hard rock in the 1970's, and they deserve more respect and recognition, for their musical contributions.  This set, and [[ASIN:B002N7W3QC Thin Lizzy - Are You Ready?: Live At Rockpalast]] (2009), are highly recommended to serious Lizzy fans, and hard rock aficionados in general.a performance standpoint, this is an absolutely killer show.

B004CD7OCI|5.0|I love this show. I can't wait for each episode! The special effects are so realistic. This series is definately worth the time to watch.
0439023491|5.0|This book suffers a bit from middle-book syndrome, but mostly it's a sound transition into the real heart and soul of this series, which is NOT violence (as some have claimed) but social and political upheavals, and how they happen. As Katniss returns from the hunger games, she is forced to live a very artificial life, largely created and controlled by the Capital. She hates it, but goes along because she believes it's the best way to keep everyone she loves safe. She becomes aware of unrest in the other districts, but starts out mostly concerned with keeping her own life stable. As things progress though, she is radicalized. The process through which this happens explores a lot of themes about how autocratic societies maintain control, what true protest is, and what is worth fighting for.<br /><br />At least that is the way I read this book - others may read it as a romance, as Katniss struggles with her feelings for both Gale and Peeta. I have to admit, this is not my favorite aspect of the book - Gale has never really grabbed me as a character, which may turn out to be part of the point, so I'm withholding judgment on that one. The romance triangle did feel a little Twilight-like in that regard, but I'm not part of the teen target demographic, so I'm willing to just give a pass on that part of the book, since I think the way it is exploring government and media control, and social protest/revolution, makes it a very worthwhile read.

B000QQH4YS|5.0|Robocop is without a doubt one of the top best Sci-Fi Action movies ever made. I can watch it over and over again and it just never fails to entertain me each and every time I see it.<br /><br />Peter Weller stars as Police Officer Alex Murphy, a Cop on a beat just trying to do his job and be the best law enforcer that he can be, who while in the line of duty is brutally gunned down by a gang of lowlife thugs. But that's only the beginning of this story, my friends. Scientists take what remains of Murphy and rebuild him into Robocop, a lethal law-enforcing cyborg that is programmed with the noble Prime Directives to serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. But somewhere deep down inside those remaining bits of human tissue, Alex Murphy/Robocop still retains some troubling memories of his past life, his interactions with family and loved ones, and the traumatic events which led to his demise.<br /><br />Despite all of that, Robocop becomes the new Hero of old Detroit as he single-handedly takes down the bad guys and starts cleaning up the corrupt city streets. But, he has significant opposition in the way of not only the petty street criminals and crime lords, but also in the form of Richard Jones, the Vice President of OCP (Omni Consumer Products), a corporation which owns and runs the Detroit Police Force, and also helped design and produce the Robocop project. It turns out that Richard Jones initially had big plans to manufacture and sell Urban Robot Pacification units labelled ED-209, an Enforcement Droid built for both patrolling city streets and also to be useful in dangerous combat missions for the military. But a test run of ED-209 for the President of OCP fails miserably, and so it is that the Robocop project goes through successfully into operation instead.<br /><br />Richard Jones still has a strong vested interest in the ED-209 project though, and he also has connections with the criminal underworld of old Detroit, and so he decides to take out Robocop in the hopes of getting his ED-209 program back on track at OCP.<br /><br />Filled with biting social satire, action sequences aplenty, touching drama scenes, some pretty cool old-school stop-motion animation scenes (remember the days before CGI?), and even some helpful guiding tips to children from Robocop himself, \\"Stay out of Trouble.\\", Haha! Well, this movie's just got it all. What are you waiting for?

B003O86FMW|2.0|I read this book after loving the first one, but was a bit disappointed by it. It is somewhat predictable, and although trilogies are supposed to be continuos there are no big events in this book. The writing is still good and keeps the reader intrigued, but after a while it becomes evident that no big events are taking place.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|For those who enjoyed the circus at 5, this is the perfect story. The book manages to bring the magic that surrounds circuses to a story of magic, imagination and fantasy for grown ups. Although other stories with similar characteristics have been told, this one manages to be new, without falling in common places. Found it very fun to read.

But when I saw it was at the top of the list, decided to give it a try, and was completely with it. It's written in a way you can't stop reading, and being a story about teens, can be easily enjoyed by those who are looking for a fun and entertaining story. I have recommended the book to my students, finding a connection between the story and human rights, and they have liked the story so far, so it has been proved in different generations with success.<br />Fully recommended!

Highly recommended
B006ON41FC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! yes, it connects to openfeint, but it's all about what you can live with. openfeint has not bothered me since I got the game about a month ago...in fact, I've hardly noticed it was there!<br />the game has only frozen on me once. it's nut a recurring problem. occasionally it gets 'sticky' and may run slow, but even that's not a daily thing. if those are things you can live with, then the game is well worth the download. :)

B000KIPT30|4.0|I connected my HA400 to the stereo audio output jacks on my TV set with a 25' 3.5 mm, unshielded, male-male audio cable that cost $3.98 with free shipping on eBay.  On the TV end I used an RCA to 3.5 mm adapter. [[ASIN:B0018MI5F6 RiteAV - 3.5mm to RCA Stereo Female Cable - 6 inch]] On the HA400 end a 3.4mm to 1/4\\" stereo plug adapter [[ASIN:B0002ZPFD0 3.5mm Stereo Jack To 1/4\\" Stereo Plug Adapter]] was necessary.  I have two sets of headphones, an old set with a 1/4\\" stereo plug and a new set with a 3.5 mm plug.  Another adapter was required for that set.  Both sets work fine and I don't get any static or hum from using the long, unshielded cable.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because today most headsets come with 3.5 mm plugs and because it doesn't have a power switch.  You must unplug the wall-wart (AC adapter) to shut it off.  If I were designing this I would have equipped it with a 3.5 mm input, two 3.5 mm jacks, 1/4\\" stereo jacks and an on/off slide switch.<br /><br />That being said, this is a cheap, adequate solution for people who are hard of hearing.  There is no annoying delay such as with the bluetooth devices.  The audio output jacks on most TV sets operate independent of the speaker output.  Even when I mute the TV sound is still delivered from the audio out jacks to this device.  My lady, with her exceptional hearing, can set the TV to a comfortable level while I overcome my deficiency with the this device.

B000EHSN9Y|3.0|If you have an older iMac w/ the mini-DVI and want to run a DVI monitor, this cable adapter will work for you.  I would have given it 5 stars had it been either a little bit longer or more flexible.  if you want to have your cable run off the back of your desk and have the laptop open, the force required to bend the cable causes it to want to come out of the mac.  I have it bundled with the other cables (stereo, USB, CAT-5, power) so that they all hold each other in.

B002ZXNZQG|5.0|Ignatius Reilly is really some piece of work!  He is absolutely the dorkiest person ever in a story.<br /> As you read this story you get the feeling that all these various characters will eventually tie together somehow, it is just so weird how it happens: unbelievable, sweet and touching.  There are four or five themes or plots that run through this story.  One is Ignatius. and his Mother getting away from a cop with nothing better to do than to try to find some miscreant to take in.  They end uip on an accident, there is property damage only, that entails that  Ignatius find gainful employment to pay the debt.<br /> The story line is about as complicated as I have ever seen  Ignatius is erudite with a Masters degree, but his psyche is Medieval.  He refuses to engage with the Twentieth century.  He is so conservtive he wants to have people act as if it was the Thirteenth or Fourteenth century.  This just makes him more of a weird character, it alo gives the author a chance to introduce old morals and philosophical concepts and a bit of Theology as well.<br /> There some interesting vignettes interspersed such as Ignatius' noble march for Moorish rights, or his imagining an Army of Gays (it would end fighting because they are more interested in frolicing with each other than fighting).  As it happens, this is the second time I hae read this story, the first was back in 2000 or 2001.  This part of the story I forgot, as well as the part about Ignatius' 'hobby'.  These forgotten parts only heightened the interest I had in rereading this story.
B001XVD21Y|1.0|This film plays all the exploitive cards:  it's gratuitously violent, its characters are stereotypes, it's jokes are vulgar, and its message celebrates hypocrisy.  The film is filled with anti-Irish cliches that seem intended to convince the new American masses that they too can survive by hook or crook.  If you value your time and money, spend it on a film that portrays the value of honest police work and the futility of gangsterism.
1468161660|5.0|I'd like to start by saying that I have not been a \\"Young Adult\\" in about 15 years, so if you are getting scared off by the YA label, don't!<br /><br />This is an incredible story that broke my heart at times, and then had it overflowing at others. What makes this  book different, (and quite frankly better), than most romances out there though was the characters. It is very rare to feel so deeply engaged with not only the main characters but the secondary ones as well. The dialogue is so unique and refreshing you will find yourself laughing out loud at times and thinking, \\"I wish I said that\\" at others. This book was so well written it's hard to believe it was a debut novel. I can't wait to see what this author has in store next.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I did a lot of searching for a case I would be happy with. At first, I over looked this one because it was a little pricey at $40 and I was concerned when I saw quite a bit of the low end reviews said the kindle fire doesn't fit well at all. Most of the other cases on Amazon are $25-35 and they all have some flaws. (They fall apart after a month, badly designed, or had a really bad odor) I decided to revisit the Verso line. I liked the way they look and they appear to be quality made. I took a chance and got this one. My kindle fire fits just fine, but what a lot of reviewers are saying about the case not staying closed is true. The thickness of the fire causes the cover to stay raised like 1/4 of an inch. If they had just added a flat elastic cord like Marware does on a lot of theirs, this case would be perfect.<br /><br />It feels and looks well made and has great style.<br />Overall I think I can tolerate the 1 flaw.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book highly.  parts of it are graphic, so its probably not for the under 10 crowd in my opinion - buts its dramatic and involved and the main character is easily relatable.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book. It had so much action and from my point of view sometimes a little mistery. Susan Colins did a grate gob and should write more books like the hunger games. I personaly recomend this to everyone. Espesualy if you like action and a little violence.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|I used this PhotoFast CR-5400 with 2 Kingston micro-SDHC 16GB class-4 cards.  Just follow the instruction booklet.  Put the micro-SD card on both empty side slots.  Then insert the PhotoFast (with 2 micro-SD loaded) inside my PSP.  Format the card from PSP XMB.  I got the combined storage of 29.5GB from this setup.  Then I connect the USB cable from my notebook to the PSP (with the adaptor inserted.)  Then enable the USB connection.  From my macbook, I can see the PSP disk mounted from the finder (Windows Explorer equivalent).  From there, I copy ISO files over.  The speed is approximately 4.X MB/sec for writing to the card.  Which is the same speed as my ancient Sandisk 4GB MS ProDuo.  I believe you may want to purchase higher speed card if your budget allow.  It takes a few minutes to transfer >1GB files over.  For me, the higher speed card is still too expensive (Class-10 cost 2x)  So, I'm happy with waiting time here. :)
B004LROUNG|5.0|The book was excellent . Very hard to put it down. the characters were very interesting and kept you wondering what they would do next.  I also read it and a friend who is a attorney and he also enjoyed it.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|u my think its dum but wen u try it is awesome i luff it this is a great ap get it if u want abs Hebe :p
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is so much fun my husband and I have contests on who is fastest and highest scorer.  I love the music and the scene's are so complete over all just a great game give it a try and I am sure you will enjoy as much as I did.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am an avid solitaire player and love this one for my Kindle Fire. Nice options, quick gameplay...nice time filler.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I do like this game. There. are so many games to play. So far many are pretty easy to complete but a few have been maddening. My main complaint is that you have to earn points by playing the games in order to unlock other games. This can take awhile so end up playing a game that earns the most points in the shortest amount of time over and over again. I also give it to my kids to play. You can also earn points by writing reviews, hence the reason for this one :-).
B006KP3XCQ|5.0|This is a great deal for a brand new dvd!  I purchased it for my 3 yr old and he is trilled.  The box is brand new and sealed in plastic.  Since the case is cardboard (not plastic) it is slightly crushed but there is a cardboard portfolio inside so the dvd we received is in perfect condition. We don't normally keep the dvd cases anyway because we prefer to use the travel cases w/sleeves for multiple dvds to save space.  Great option for someone who wants a new dvd for 1/4 the price but doesn't care about the packaging.
0399226907|5.0|I am a nanny and have been caring for babies and toddlers for over a decade. I am always looking for good children's books. The Very Hungry Caterpillar is my very favorite Children's book and it always has been. A true classic that should be on the bookshelf of every home that has a child.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Amazing app. Its just like steam on the computer. I can see all the specials that are going on, buy games, chat with friends, everything except play games and its layed out amazingly. Worth the download for sure. Only trouble I had was remembering my login info for Steam.
B004FDPOHC|5.0|Aside from the fact that not all the tracks for the entire soundtrack are available from 1 source, this album is perfection.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Daft Punk, but this is among the best of their best.<br /><br />It is true, the soundtrack is arguably better than the actual movie. In addition, these tracks are what made the visuals feel so vast and epic in the movie.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I'm so glad I got this app. I get a lot of email and I'm able to take care of it during the day now and don't have to stay up late to get it all read.
B0063GORYU|3.0|too much time spent on this game... :) fun, but has better features on the ipad version, such as &quot;winning hand&quot; deals.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I love this app. I have the whole Daily series. To certain reviewers that say nothing new, what kind of new ways are you looking for to work your abs? I think you were looking for a non workout, workout.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|With over 1,000 5 star reviews, I don't think I need to address the story-line since I'm sure it has been well established. What I WILL say is that this is one of the most delightful books I've read in some time. I wasn't sure if an entire novel comprised of letters sent back and forth amongst characters would keep my interest, but I was pulled into the lives of these funny, quirky, cozy, and loveable people right away and stayed engaged until the last word on the last page. \\"Enchanting\\" is not a word I normally use, but it seemed to perfectly describe The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. I was ignorant of the invasion of the Guernsey area during World War II, so it was also interesting to learn this small slice of history. This novel is a definite \\"keeper\\" in my mind, and I'm sure I will re-visit its pages many times.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|I upgraded to this version of The Sound of Music on Blu-ray from the basic edition of TSOM and I am very glad I did. I picked up this set when Amazon had it for $28 as the weekly Blu-ray deal. It is a very nice, very solid set. I have many of these Blu-ray limited edition/special edition box sets (Blade Runner, Ben-Hur, Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, Casablanca, Planet of the Apes, I am Legend... ) and this is one of the nicest I own.<br /><br />The box is very solid and well constructed. Everything looks very professionally done and the box art colors are very vibrent. I didn't know what it was by the picture, but there is a little music box which is also very nice.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is wonderful in PQ and AQ. The only reason I gave the video 4.5 instead of 5 is because there are few scenes here or there which are a blur or out of focus. This is due to the scorce material and Fox did the best they could with what they had to work with. No matter what this is by far the best it has ever looked or sounded, and it all comes in this very nice set.<br /><br />I thought about it for a while, but I am very glad I pulled the trigger and purchased this set. A wonderful edition to my collection.
B006C1DH92|5.0|This game is wonderful and I find myself playing it more then Fruit Ninja. This is well worth the 99&cent; and my kids love it as well!
B007BLCGNU|1.0|Seeing this movie in theatre was especially painful to see leonardo look ridiculous with a terrible makeup job.  I was aware that hoover was a closet homosexual and that some of the movie might be based on that but i did think it would be more about history and less about a male love story.  [[ASIN:B006VYFB1C Moneyball (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack Including Bonus DVD) [Blu-ray]]] buy moneyball instead which was atleast mentioned at the academy awards.
B0018QQQK8|1.0|Worst. Book. Ever.<br /><br />I started counting how many times he used the pedantic writer's favorite verb \\"padded\\" before I even got into the meat of the novel. The meat was actually spam like-lacking any realism and pumped full of filler.<br /><br />An amoeba is more complex than these characters.<br /><br />If you like \\"writing\\" at a level my two year old could read, this is the book for you.<br /><br />The only enjoyment I had was guessing if the obviously predictable ending would be as poorly done as I guessed it might.<br /><br />This book is the final straw that has led me to drop out of my book club.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|[[ASIN:B001U0HBQ0 The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I purchased this movie on blu ray the criterion collection edition and was amazed at th quality and attention to detail that went with this edition.  I really suggest buying that veraion of the movie because of the diffence in quality i can recognize more depth in the sound in my in home theatre with 10,000 watts the highs and lows are crystal clear.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great product. Better than expected. Less expensive that the I -Pad and does the job with wi-fi connection. I find it easier to read books on this devise than a hard copy.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Pixar movies ever. Maybe it's partly because of how cute and adorable Boo is, or the sweet relationship she has with Mike and Sully. Sigh... Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed this one, not to mention the musical score by Randy Newman, which brings so much extra energy and life to the film. If all monsters were like this, I wouldn't mind having seven or eight of them hiding under my bed :-) Anyway, I just hope Pixar continues making more films like this, because these are exactly the kinds of films I hope to share with my own little ones someday.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|the title says it all my man<br />I can sync data between my ipod and kindle fire.<br />I can also retrieve everything on my Pc.
0316066524|2.0|I don't know, maybe it was just me, but this book was all over the place and hard to follow. The weird use of phrasing and language with some of the characters was especially distracting.  The New York Times, Time Mag., etc. all said good things... but I just didn't get it.
