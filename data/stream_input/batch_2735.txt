B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I picked one of these up from Best Buy today. It is a great product at a great price. I received an email with my free Netflix code before I even left the store. The setup was extremely simple and took maybe 3 or 4 minutes. I am using a Samaung Galaxy Tab 2 and it works effortlessly, although when I tried it on my iPhone 5 it said it is not yet supported on this device. Netflix and YouTube worked perfectly without any pauses for buffering which I frequently got on the Xbox 360. The surround sound worked perfectly as and the videos were clear and crisp with no fuzziness or distortion. The free Netflix code worked fine on my current account which I think is great. It is a great device for the price and I am excited for them to add more apps soon. For those complaining about the Chrome mirroring not being perfect remember that Google specifically states that it is in Beta which obviously means it won't work perfectly as it is still in test mode... Duh!
B0093FNZT6|4.0|Eban Alexander is a talented neurosurgeon with extensive experience of how the brain operates and how it closes down under physical trauma and life threatening infections. One day Eban is a healthy person, the next day he is fighting for his life with an extremely rare e-coli bacterial meningitis which has shut down all of the neocortex of his brain - the part that makes us human. \\"Inoperative, In essence, absent. When your brain is absent you are absent, too.\\"<br /><br />This book is about Eban's experiences (memories?) when he was completely absent and on the edge of death for seven days. He didn't have a body but he remembers visiting places in a beautiful dream world - which to him was completely real. No words are spoken there but he clearly gets the message \\"You are loved - love is without doubt the basis of everything.\\" During his NDE Eban remembers being allowed a grand tour of the most amazing and indescribable places with different levels of comfort before he miraculously returns to reality and life.<br /><br />This was an interesting and well written book but not as much of an epiphany to me as to some others who have stronger beliefs. I was especially reassured by the theme of love which is absent from so many of the things that happen throughout the world every day. I am an agnostic and don't really know what all of this means, how it affects me or even if I believe Eban's experiences, which could easily have been generated at the time his brain function was starting up again.<br /><br />This book is outside my normal reading diet of best-selling thrillers and mysteries and provided an interesting interlude. I was amazed by the popularity of this book and the number of reviews which are only normally exceeded to my knowledge by erotica like Fifty Shades of Grey and YA tastes for Harry Potter.<br /><br />See over 200 Suncoast Reviews with full author index - [...]
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is occupies me and I think it is sort of a fun memory game and you have to find hidden clues.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like this game but you have to buy so much in gold. I would like it better if it used more coin items.
B00542UMIY|5.0|I like it because is family friendly and entertainment, also teaches good things like to return items not yours, not to judge other for their outer appearance, finally to help others.<br /><br />the only bad thing I don't like is some of the words used, they were not a lot but a few bad language other than that Is a good movie
B004YM6JK0|5.0|I watched this series from the beginning over 8 years ago.  Played a whole season while traveling by car. Well written, good acting. Hope the series continues for at least as many seasons as the X-files did.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is a really fun game you have to find different objects in different rooms and you earn rewards and thing and you complete quests.It is actually more fun then how I explained. But I just got the game today and played it for a while and I noticed it wasn't mysterious like whodunit mysteries it wasn't that mysterious at all but it was still pretty for what it was.
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|From beginning to end, a fantastic series with the exception of the last two part episodes. Not as well written as the rest of the series, most likely due to the fact the series was cancelled and an ending had to be filmed. Fantastic scenery, very professional actors, directors, the series was cut short. The extras on the first season dvd were up close and personal with the cast.  Well done.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show, very entertaining. The acting is also very good with the writers doing an amazing job at character development. If you haven't seen it, give it a try, you won't regret it!
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Best show ever....can't wait to see where it leads...Mike and Rachel's little whatever their doing gets intense like my own situation
B00BRR66SA|5.0|This is one of the few CD's that I have ever purchased that I can honestly say does not have a song on it that I skip.  They may not all be awesome but none are bad either.  My taste is eclectic and JT has done a very good job of covering a lot of styles with this offering, not just dance or hip hop.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book i read it in one day! I went to get my toes done and brought it in with me as soon as I was finnished getting ready for bed i read and read and read until i finnished! LOVED IT!!!😍😍😍
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I love this game.  It extremely addicting.  I hope they continue to keep making them to challenge me.  One suggestion.  A help button for when you get stuck
B002436WFI|4.0|You cannot translate terry Pratchett books to film unless you are prepared to go the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings investment in time and money. But for a TV movie it was well done, and it did bring the characters to life. David Jason was a very believable Rincwind
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have only played this game for a day and I'm already loving it if you haven't played this you are missing out on life
B0054SMID0|4.0|Great story by Michael Conelly. I would recommend it. Just as good as any of John Grishams stuff. Would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys those types of movies. I hope they do more movies with the same characters just like they do with his books.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I rarely watch movies as I dont get enough time to watch, anything other than my kids..But I did took out time for Hunger Games and it was worth it. I was truly impressed by the movie, acting, story. I am looking forward to the Hunger Games Part II.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book I could never put down its just filled with excitement and I can't wait to see the movie to get a even better understanding
B004XIZK5K|5.0|This book breaks down the kettlebell very well. It helps you learn the basics and helps you work your way up to more challenging workouts
0060763280|5.0|This is in my top 2 books of ALL TIME!<br /><br />I highly recommend not only reading it, but studying and implementing the ideas and strategies!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my little sister was playing it first then I found it on kindle fire and got soo addicted to it!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I have always been a fan of historic fiction novels. This one tops the list of favorites. You  know that you have just read a good book when you miss the characters.
B00000J2PH|5.0|What can you say. Its as good today as when it first came out. I got one for my sister too.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Amazing movie. No real complaints, other than you can only view the deleted scenes on the blu ray, not the digital or the dvd.
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|It has a little romance, a lot of great comedy, serious drama and overall is quite entertaining.<br />I would certainly recommend it to others to see.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Well, it's been 35 long years since Ozzy's last Sabbath studio album, so excitement and expectation from fans was high. I think they fulfilled the expectations, as this album is vintage early Sabbath with that doom and gloom tone and feel to it. Geezer Butler provides the booming, thumping bass lines that define their sound, while Tony Ionmi comes up with all of the cool heavy metal riffs. With Ozzy providing the voice and energy that was once a Sabbath trademark, we're treated to an onslaught of heavy songs that pound your speakers endlessly. I will say that some of the songs sound a little like Ozzy's solo stuff in addition to early Sabbath, but this obviously isn't a bad thing. The standouts on this album (Deluxe Edition) are END OF THE BEGINNING (which sounds like Black Sabbath), GOD IS DEAD? (which sounds like Iron Man) and ZEITGEIST, which sounds like Planet Caravan. For the 3 bonus tracks, I like PARIAH the most, though all are good. It's too bad that Bill Ward didn't participate in this album; it's very good, so he missed out. I give this album 4.5 stars, and it's a must-have for older and newer fans alike.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love hidden object games and this is a really fun one! I really liked the story line! Fast paced, easy to navigate! G5 makes great fun games! I will play this game over and over!
B008YJFDQK|5.0|ABSOLUELY FANTASTIC......I 'stumbled' across Ben Harper through a demo of 4 or 5 songs and I HAVE BEEN HOOKED<br />EVER SINCE!!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a game that lets you create your own business universe. The game itself, having over one hundred types of buildings it surely grants enough play with the level system. Yet it may be a little too slow for consistent gaming due to the slow energy recharge.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|WOW! After eight seasons, this is still a quality show! Whatever you're doing, don't change a thing! I'm a fan!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Love hidden object games. This one also had a few puzzles that were very easy. Now to look for another game.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I like the new version of a already great premise! I like the female Watson and the interaction with this Sherlock. I also like that in all his perfections, that he has a demon that he struggles with daily and reminds us that he's not perfect. I love the modernization of these characters.
0425263908|5.0|This is a page turner that you can't put down! very hot and steamy! i loooove this series! i recommended it to all my friends
B007TUAHVQ|4.0|My son loves this set. He's 9 and he's a big Halo fan. The only down side seems to be that the \\"guys\\" break more easily than the Lego guys.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Himself sets a date with a cold beer and watches this film at least 3 times a year.  Multiple that by 27 years of marriage...sigh.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Everything worked the way it should. Easy to use,orders always on hand when they are needed. Help is there if you need it
B0063IH60K|3.0|The kindle fire is much slower at solitaire versus and I pad.  The screen layout changes from verticle to horizontal and is distracting as well as slow.  I am glad it was free because I would have hated to pay for this game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was another great season. many twists and sadness. I always wonder at the efforts of the servants in such a household, so much so I borrowed Robert Roberts House servants directory 1827 to read the tasks expected.
B00D6B4PUG|2.0|I may be just me, but I like to be able to click on a bunch of emails to mark as read, then easy deselect them all.  This app makes that difficult.  I went back to the one that came with my Kindle.
0385349947|3.0|I am struggling through reading this book. I can't get over the fact that all this author does is comment on how horrible women of different generation are. Why not think of the positive!!!  The seller of the book sent the book very fast and I have no complaints about that.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was very well written.  The plot was excellent.  You didn't see the ending coming.  All different characters and discussed different types of science.  Couldn't put it down! Also brought up some interesting points about teenagers.
B0090EIILU|1.0|If you liked his first movie along the same lines, don't bother with this one.  Its way way over the top and not at all funny.
0887307280|5.0|If you own your own business or are even in management this will change the way you view your world.
0981951252|5.0|This book really helps you with putting a plan together for the long term. Great for the person who needs better controls on their life whether it be financial or emotional.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Its fun. It has neat stuff. I hate running out of energy. Im not spending real money for it. Is this enough words for this review yet? Ya.... it is now i think.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I started reading Percy Jackson last year. It is my favorite book series. There is only one bad thing about these books.  The cliffhanger suck.
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|First I am a big fan of the series.  There is hardly any aspect of this production that I would not give the highest of recommendations to.  However, (and yes sadly there is a however.)  Season 3 was included in what PBS has broadcast,  but PBS simply lists this as Season 1 and Season 2 (or course it could be the fault of the cable company, after all what kind of story would this be were there not a villain!)  So when I saw SEASON 3 I was delighted enough to order it from AMAZON.  Sadly it was what I had already seen!  SO LADIES AND GENTLEMAN,  PLEASE DO NOT BUY SEASON 3 IF YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT ON PBS!!!  You will be just as disappointed as I was.  Although it did help with the \\"jones\\" was I was going through without a weekly visit to England.<br /><br />FOR ANYONE WHO HAS THE DESIRE.  TAKE A TRIP TO LONDON,  SPEND A WEEK SEEING A NEW SHOW EVERY NIGHT IT HELPS GET YOU TRHOUGH THE DOWN SIDE BETWEEN SEASONS.  AN EVEN BETTER WAY TO DO IT IS TO TAKE THE QUEEN MARY2 FROM NEW YORK TO SOUTH HAMPTON.  THE SERVICE IS WONDERFUL,  ALL THINGS ENGLISH AND THAT COMBINED WITH 7 NIGHTS OF THEATRE IN LONDON WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO SEE THE NEXT SEASON NO MATTER WHAT NUMBER IS ON IT,  ALL THE MORE!  CHEERS!!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love playing Mahjong and this game adds a new way to play.  I love the mobility of the cube and the ability of seleting tiles on different side to delete them.  The colors are bright and inviting; i wish more games were this colorful.  This was one of the first games i really enjoyed playing on my Kindle Fire and i have been enjoying it since Mother's Day when I got my Kindle Fire.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I missed the first 3 seasons and discovered I could watch them on my new Kindle Fire HD - What a great series!  I can't wait for January for the new season to start!  I plan on re-watching the first 3 seasons again just in case I missed something the first time around!
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|Makes you feel better for his wife, and someone else's insight to what he was dealing with.  They didn't show Mr. Lincoln in his true fashion, but a glimpse of just one issue.<br />Overall, outstanding movie.  Unless you are a history buff or someone who has studied Mr. Lincolns' life.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I really like Gaiman's narrative voice. This was an excellent book, but not his best (hey, Neil's 4-stars are still pretty good!). It felt like a fleshed-out short story rather than a full novel. I'm all for the economy of story-telling, but I personally would have liked a bit more.<br /><br />Still, recommended to Gaiman fans and newbies alike!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I can put my kindle in my bag and take it everywhere with me and know it will be unharmed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is great and i have tons of fun playing it. i play minecraft on xbox and pc too. they are all great! but i just need to know when 0.7.2 will come out for kindle. thanks!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really fun game. great for entertainment. could play it all day if my battery allowed. one of the coolestvgames I have played in a while
1250007208|5.0|I first heard of Cinder when a student could hardly put it down to focus in my class.  She said it was one of the best books she had read so I put it on \\"my list\\" of books to read... eventually.  Then the media specialist and the literacy team chose Cinder as one of the books on the Summer Reading List and since I had decided to read all of the books on the list Cinder moved right up to the top of mine.<br /><br />It was a little odd to see Cinder as a cyborg in the future but it wasn't very long until I was caught up into the story and the cyborg part was really quite intriguing.  The way that Cinder interacted with her step family was compelling and I was almost in tears at times because of the twists and turns she went through as they were even harder on her than traditional retellings.  I really enjoyed the interactions with the prince and I liked that they met early in the story rather than falling in love at first site at the ball.<br /><br />The only thing that was disappointing about the book was that it ended and I didn't have the sequel to pick up immediately!
B00594XOZU|5.0|it would be alot better if we had video for kik or file kicker I get videos all the time that I can't watch because there's no app for it
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I got this when they first came out because it sounded so cool! Before I was using an HDMI cord to connect my iPad to my TV, but I couldn't control it from anywhere, I had to be right at the TV.<br /><br />Well the Chomecast works great when it's working. Maybe it's my apps & not the Chromecast, because it always works fine when I stream from the Chrome browser on my computer. Either way, something needs to be fixed!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addicting game..best app ever.tried some and they just wasn't as good. Once you get going....you can't stop til you have more coins
B008JFUQ3O|1.0|If you have very small children or kids that are easily scared, DO NOT take them to this movie!  The minions are captured, given shots, turned into monsters and put in cages.  There's even a scene where someone fills a hypodermic syringe with liquid and then this is injected into a cute, fluffy rabbit.  All of this is shown on the screen along with the rabbit's pained expression when he gets the shot.<br /><br />There were kids crying in the theater and those families left when their children said they didn't want to watch the movie anymore.<br /><br />I'd give this ZERO STARS, if I could!<br /><br />Loved the first movie, HATED this one!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is a fun game.<br />(this review was written by my 10 year old son. He is an expert on the subject). :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed playing this game. Told other friends about it; they agreed it is very addictive. Wish there were more games like this. I love games that make you think!!!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Great background choices &amp; tons of games ... I love it!  Playing onetime is challenging &amp; you can literally play forever
0062255657|5.0|This is an amazing book. Neil Gaiman fans will not be disappointed. It is a short read, but considering taking your time with it. There's a lot of depth here and if you breeze through it you may miss some elements.
B000002SE0|5.0|I have ONLY the LP version of this set, which, despite its age, is a real pleasure to listen to. Somehow Angel was using very advanced mastering and pressing techniques for this particular set, even though I don't find most of their old LP offerings to be of similarly high quality. So, to those who compliment EMI on the remastering, I submit that it was the original recording and mastering, not the re-mastering, that was of unusual quality.<br /><br />The LP version has the advantage of including a very nice booklet with full libretto and many illustrations. If you happen across the set at a vintage vinyl sale, it might be worth the purchase price just to get the booklet. The cover of the set has a head-and-shoulders picture of Nilsson in costume.<br /><br />I also own the Ricciarelli/Domingo/Von Karajan CD set and have no strong preference for either of them.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This movie was wonderful. It feels like an independent film, so I recommend it to anyone that enjoys that sort of film. The writing is genius and I laughed through much of the movie. The acting is brilliant as well and fans of Benedict Cumberbatch will not be disappointed, he is amazing in this movie and he really tugs at the heart strings. I will warn you though, I cried (a lot) at the end of this movie, which is something that made me respect it even more, because it is very rare for that to happen to me. I absolutely loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Where to start? Used the Prime Trial and got 2 day shipping. Unboxed and plugged it in to TV. If your HDMI is 1.4 or above, it will power up. If not there is a USB power cord and a wall adaptor. Luckily, my TV has a USB port right beside the HDMI and I was able to plug it in. My TV is wall-mounted, and you cannot see the dongle or wiring, it is completely hidden. Setup took 3 minutes with my Nexus 7 and the Chromecast App. Sadly, only got 1 month of Netflix, not the 3 months advertised. It works exactly as advertised, YouTube, Netflix, Google Play Music, Google Play TV all stream very, very well. Once you \\"cast\\" whatever you choose, it runs in the background and you can still have full functionality of your tablet. I walked to another room, signed into Netflix on my phone and was able to then control it from there. Seamless! The Chrome Browser mirroring feature is an 8/10. It is stretched and skewed lightly, and video was at points perfect and other times choppy or laggy. Browser Mirroring is specifically listed as in BETA, so it will get better. As more and more app developers add the code to their apps, we will see amazing results. You cannot beat $35 for what this does and for the potential it possesses. Buy it if you're smart, cut another cord and thank Google for producing something so simple and so amazing.<br /><br />Update: 7/30/13, out of the blue, I awoke this morning to an email from Amazon with a 3 free months Netflix gift code. Awesome!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book, love Stephen king! Started a little slow but didn't take long to grab my attention! I love King!
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|A modern book on how money and greed govern over decency and that decent people have little chance to leak through the loopholes of power.<br /><br />A great read. Reading leCarre is like drinking a glass of good matured wine.
0517101343|5.0|I found this book to be very easy to follow and understand. As the cover states it gives instructions in a step by step format. All the information is vital but is a waste of time if you do not Practice, Practice, Practice.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I missed it live and really enjoyed it this many  years later. Can't wait until I see all five seasons.<br />Sue
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super addictive and my 7 year old will love it too<br />Its pretty challenging even after doing temple run but not too challenging
B001HN6922|4.0|the only thing I found was that the Case was a little cracked but the DVD was in great shape. Also my three year old son loves this movie
B001LF3YQK|3.0|I really like the look and feel of this product.  It feels heavy duty, like it won't break easily or fall apart.  After a few weeks of using it though, I notice I have to be very careful to put it in the diaper bag properly or it will slide open and dry out the wipes.  It's really easy to use and if you had a diaper bag that is configured differently than mine, I think it would be great.  I slide mine into a narrow side pocket in a Skip Hop diaper bag.  Since it's the same brand, it seems the two products should work better together, so that's my issue.  Otherwise I would give it five stars.  It's easy to use, easy to open, holds a good number of wipes without being bulky and it's cute.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Five stars it was awesome to read.  It held my attention and I think it is a great love story
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you liked the movie, you will love this book.  If you loved the movie, you won't be able to put this book down.
160774273X|3.0|The author repeatedly mentions his pecan raisin recipe as being fantastic. He describes how he developed the recipe. Unfortunately after reading all about this bread, there was no recipe for it. If he didn't want to disclose the recipe, he should not have mentioned the bread!!!!<br />There was way too much info in the book about the author. A little info would have been fine, but the author writes as if he expects the reader to be fascinated with his life. I didn't want to know that he makes coffee at 4am while taking a break from making pecan raisin bread. Did I mention that there was no recipe for the pecan raisin bread?<br />The method used wastes a lot of flour. Even if the bread is good, it will be very expensive with all the throwing away of flour. A lot of equipment is required to make the the author's bread, not only to buy but to store in a limited kitchen.<br />I don't know whether I will return this book. So far the pizza dough looks very good. My family likes pizza.
0061122416|5.0|This was a required summer reading assignment for my daughter. Received as promised, read & now ready to go back to school with homework done.
B0050XFY4O|3.0|It's erotic and charged with beautiful eye candy but the directing and story direction don't seem to have a clear end point.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The only thing we didn't like about the movie is that Edward Norton didn't play the Hulk, otherwise its a great movie. I would say children should only watch it with parental guidance because their is a lot of violence. We watched it with our children and explained things along the way, but our children have a very firm grasp that its pretend.
B00785P2QC|5.0|A little hard to Learn how to play. But after that it is really fun! Ask for a lot of things with facebook.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was chosen by my book club. I don't think I would have picked it on my own. (The synopsis really didn't interest me) but once I started,  it was hard to put down! Definitely a quick read! You immediately begin to view flowers differently! I never even knew flowers had a language! Anyways I highly suggest this book!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Like I said in my review for season 3, when the show first started I watched a few episodes and then stopped. Recently, I have had extra time so I tried again and OMFG what an amazing show! LOVE IT!!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Usually the 1st thing I look at each morning. Also list places I'm going to be visiting soon for conferences or vacation to see what to expect.<br />Having the local forecast of whereabouts you are is nice too.<br />Have a nice day.<br />Florante
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Like I said in my review for season 3, when the show first started I watched a few episodes and then stopped. Recently, I have had extra time so I tried again and OMFG what an amazing show! LOVE IT!!!!!!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I love Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Their chemistry just radiates through this film. They are adorable on their own, but even more so together. I love their wit and their romance in 500 Days.
193700788X|1.0|Someone leaked the ending to me as well as some other things that happened. And I couldn't believe it! I was so upset that I refused to read it. She should have somehow ended up with Eric, they had been together for so many books and he always loved her. And then she ends up with her reliable friend Sam. Nothing personal against Sam, I could see how that could happen but don't just throw it all together at the end like that.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Ignorance of scripture is ignorance of Christ Jesus.<br /><br />This guy's premises that Jesus came to free the Jews from Roman oppression is patently false. He came to free them from sin. By healing the sick and raising the dead we get the picture of what sin is, but it is much more. I just saw an interview on MSNBC of this author and was flabbergasted that no one there knew anything about Jesus the Savior. There is precious little historical documents about him. But the true encounter with Christ Jesus is through scripture and there is no other way. He is the way, the truth and the light. All of this nonscense that he was in spirit a zelot is just petty distraction. Read the Bible if you want to meet Jesus, and I suggest you find a reputable Bible study class taught by someone filled with the Holy Spirit who can open your eyes.  I know it helped me.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's not really a Google TV﻿ replacement. It buffers kind of slow, wish it had a LAN dongle, not just wifi. It also needs the Amazon Instant Video﻿ app. It's good for the bedroom TV. We'll keep the Vizio﻿ Co-Star hooked up to the living room TV.<br /><br />Still waiting on my NetFlix code. It was purchased before the cut off time on July 24 2013 @ 2:00pm.<br /><br />Update:07/AUG/2013 - I have used it twice since it arrived on 26/JULY/2013, I set it up in the bedroom.<br />Vizio Co-Star in the living room is use primarily.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|it does nothing, i hate it and will never use it or tell anyone about it.Once again let me reiterate it sucks
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Can't play the game after the intro. It stalls on the loading page. Had to unloaded the app and reloAd it. Continues to do the same thing!!!
B00BESM14U|5.0|There should have been academy awards for almost every category for this movie! Lead actor was a break out awesome surprise, Emma Watson was allowed to show off her full range of acting ability and the direction was perfect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game for kindle controls could be better but the world generates faster on my kindle than on the computer.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|friend recommended it, its challenging but easy to play, takes time to get the hang of it and fun once you do.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Download was smooth. No problems installing software and loaded on my son's ipod with out a hitch. He is happy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a very fun and interesting game. I recommend it for the younger kids it keeps them occupied and is very eduacational
B00CATSONE|5.0|I wanted to say thank you for writing this book on the inventor that probably impacted the 20th century more than any other man of his time. Nikola Tesla was a brilliant inventor but more than that he was a man of character. Thank you for including that aspect of his genius.
B001BKVWYG|3.0|This is an early albumn from 1970, his first.  His second is a release, &#34; Coming from Reality &#34;.  He has not produced more studio recordings but did put out two live album recordings for South Africa and Austrailia.  The soundtrack from &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; - and in 2012, the Sundance Film Festival hosted the premiere of the documentary film.  This documentary was made after fans in South Africa, thinking he had commited suicide, raised enough interest to get Rodriguez into the country for performances and thus this documentary. This early music on Cold Fact is the core of his talents displayed when he was in his prime and he continues to perform due to his fame from this and Sugarman's generated interest. I like Rodriguez and will continue to listen to him on the two Albumn I own and most likely will purchase his next Studio Albumn, if it ever comes out.
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|We picked this movie because we like Aaron Eckhart.  It reminded us quite a bit of the Bourne trilogy...  The sound score was similar.  The plot was similar, but instead of Jason and girl [Marie] it is Dad and daughter.  Liana Liberato did a great job as the daughter, very believable and compelling - especially her outbursts about Dad doing bad things and doesn't he know any better.  At times it is a little hard to follow and there are some \\"leaps of faith\\" for plausibility.  It does contain the same corrupt good guys are after them plot.  BUT, it was still very entertaining.  I guess it was the evolution of the relationship between Dad and daughter... and filling in the blanks about what happened to Mom.  We're glad we rented it.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I don't know much about dub step,  I'm not sure I would like other artists of this genre, but what Ms Stirling does with the violin is unique as far as know.  The electronica does not over shadow her performance.  The only real complaints I have are the clapping noise on some of the songs, and the layering on transcendence, which is an important song to her.  Be sure to check out videos of her live concert performances on youtube.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|These guys are getting old but the action was entertaining. I will watch again on a day when I can't find anything else.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This book is so well written that I feel like I lived it along with William.  Every life and every story has highs and lows, but few people ever escape such hunger and poverty to travel the world and effect such change.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Teen beach movie has really cool people in it! The songs are really catchy! They are so catchy that me and my little sister of 4 can't stop singing them, and dancing along !  Teen beach is the coolest and we have watched it every day of the holiday since it was shown on Disney!<br />By Evie age 7
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is a really fun and addicting game!! I would highly recommend this app. GET THIS APP!!!!! Please. please please. :)
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This app will not open most of the time since the last update. Why can't Amazon fix this app? Nook reader works perfectly every time<br />if only my kindle e books would work on a different ereader I would be so happy. Or if Amazon would finally fix the kindle reader so it works every time .I would be happy.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It kept me coming back until I could finally complete it. I had a little bit of trouble figuring out to go back and forth in the beginning, once I got the hang of it I found it very interesting.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The characters in this show are so believable-the story compelling. Not much of a &#34;series&#34; person, but it is so well done.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My three year old grandson doesn't know is alphabet so I purchased this app for him on my kindle.  It is definitely helping him learn the alphabet characters and he is having fun doing it.
B005O7PXNS|3.0|With the new precinct captain and Beckett's never-ending belittling of Castle, I wonder if this fellow can ever catch a break, even though he does some pretty clever stuff.  I wish he would say &#34;enough&#34; and direct his savvy, success and wealth toward more appreciate acquaintances.  Beckett is a bitch--I wouldn't invite her for a cup of coffee if I thought she would behave the way she does toward Castle.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game... like temple run, subway surfer and angry grab run all in one wonderful game!!!! My only issue is that the game sometimes starts glitching and I lose lives like that.... please try to repair this issue.
B0043WDK2G|4.0|This season had good balance of murder mysteries, personality conflicts and Castle struggles with daughter and mother.  The character Roy Montgomery's presence added a likable but strong authority figure to the cast, as opposed to the situation in season 4.
1612680011|5.0|This book is definitely an eye opener!  I loved how Mr. Kiyosaki explained everything.  His delivery is excellent.  A must read for all!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Decent book for a first in a series. You get to know the characters and its full of surprises. I will be reading the next one.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed the reading, but of course there were medical parts that I had trouble understanding. It was very easy<br />to follow.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was a very good book. it was a little short. I want to read the next one right away
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|I've heard a lot of great things about Neil, although I had not read any of his work until this book.  Im also a huge fan of Tori, ( Amanda as well ) and I was really looking forward to seeing what Neil was all about.  Unfortunately, I was utterly bored through the entire story.  I wanted to like it, but honestly,  it was a complete snoozzzzze.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent storyline, fabulous acting and terrific chemistry between the characters; a must watch for legal show aficionados! Just do it!
B001IF277K|5.0|I purchased this item as a replacement for my 2 year old battery that drains out more often. This one is perfect and stands for longer time, charges well and holds it for longer time.. I use it for very long calls and it is great and worth money spent on it than going for an upgrade..this saved me a lot of money..
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|It was a good movie but was very hard to keep all the timelines straight. We also had two little distractions (children) that made it very hard to keep our full attention on the movie. Watch this movie in a quiet place.
B000093BDX|5.0|What more is there to say. Every song is a hit, brings back great memories. This is a must have for your collection.
B00DU74U74|5.0|The movie was great and followed the book almost perfectly. I really enjoyed it and have watched it multiple times.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I enjoyed the first 2 books but Entwined was even a complete book. There was pretty much no story line and is only setting up for the next book which isn't needed. Sylvia Day got greedy trying to extend to 4 books and I won't read anything else of hers. Not worth the money!!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Good movie with a lot of over-the-top action. Some of the action scenes were very far fetched and unrealistic. Could have been better.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|friggin' thing wouldn't even open, I uninstalled and re-installed it and it still didn't work so I uninstalled it for the last time.
0446310786|5.0|The book came in pristine condition, the packaging made it so the book looked as though I had just bought it at a store.  It also came only a day or so after purchased, which was extremely surprising!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Hooked and cannot put it down!! Lots of fun for all and can be played by anyone at anytime!! Great Game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love that this game has no &quot;get a membership to unlock this feature.&quot; You can never just play for a second, it's never ending. You have to continue playing and playing and playing t  get anywhere with your horse. I LOVE IT! !!!
0793518326|5.0|The Beatles = Best of the Best !!!! What to say about these folks from Liverpool the way they changed the Rock music forever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much I'm saving up for the mom .me and my cousin play it all day
B009K916ZK|5.0|Apple overcharges for their equipment, everyone knows that. But, the extra expense can often be worth it: would you want to undercut an OEM for an off-brand adapter when you have an investment in your machine, or if it is earning you money? Of course not. Suck it up and buy the OEM: it's built solidly, works almost instantaneously, and will work for a LONG time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|saw a friend play this and its just awesome. no issues while playing on my kindle. awesome way to kill time
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|At first it was hard to play but i figured it out and now it's a pretty cool game bro.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I've been playing this game since it first came out on armor games and even donated money to the developers so they could expand the game, and I'll gladly pay for the game again on my kindle
B00785P2QC|5.0|I am adicted to this game its diffrent from other games that ive played you get to build ur.own.city the way u want too.
B0053KWDES|5.0|amazing product i used them with the ath m50s and they bring sound up to a whole new level. they also make normal headphones sound great the only issue is once u use them u never wanna go back to just the headphones
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so adorable, awesome, and fun. I personally think it is a good game for little kids. I really liked the Despicable Me movies. They are hilarious. I never thought they would make a game out of it though.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this app so much!  Taking care of new dragons every day!  It is almost real. And, dun dun duna! IT IS FREEEEEEEE!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a good game. This game forces you to use your brain. I enjoy games like this. Well done 5 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome I thought it would be dumb and that but it is an absolute must get!!!!!!!!awesome game for kids and adults
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three book in 3 days. Awesome read!! Could not put it down for anything! This is a must read!
0233001506|5.0|This is an excellent book for preschoolers. Even my older children, tweens are still entranced by these stories. Curious George is full of humor, and teaches the problems that can occur when one just does stuff impulsively. The only caveat, everything always turns out all right for Curious George in the end, which mutes the message of the stories.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I first heard this album and thought it must be from a group from my past. It really grows on me.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have a really hard time putting this game down. It is one of my all time favorite games. I think I am just about finished with Chapter 2.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was an interesting read.  I think the author must be a political science major because there was a  lot of political talk in this book.  Sometimes it felt like he really want to write about political stuff rather than zombies.  After reading the book I went to see the movie.  I was disappointing as it was very different from the book.  The book is a series of interviews with survivors and the movie, although it had its moments was just more hollywood crap.  I enjoyed reading about how the zombie war affected human beings, that was different take on this genre.  I still prefer the Walking Dead over this.  However, I recommended for those of you who enjoyed reading about zombies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really cool game. Wish there were more levels, by since it is free I can't really complain. Good way to pass some time.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is an amazing app, I only wished it could have been accessed whether you have Wi-Fi or not!! Would still recommend though
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game. It is fast paced and easy to play. Full of fun. Hard to put down once you start playing.
B00DURILJ2|5.0|Everything about this movie was perfect. I wanted to go back in the theater and watch it again. No other movie like it, it might be my all time favorite.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really enjoy playing both the bingo and slots. I haven't spent any real money on it and I've been playing about 5 weeks. My 6 year old can play bingo using one card, so its fairly simple. Live chat made me realize that I may need to get friends to &quot;complete&quot; each room, in which you collect puzzle pieces. I still play daily so it keeps my attention.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So glad I found this book. I love it. Couldn't put it down. I know I'll fly through Shift too... I'm only sorry ill have to wait a few weeks for the third installment, Dust!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I recommend this app to everyone because it's fun and easy. Please get it! It's my favorite game by this creator
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played. its challenging and fun at the same time. love this game.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing Bingo Blitz. It is my favorite game.  It offers challenge and fun at the same time. Also, the variety of options is appealing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have been really enjoying this game.  After a long day at work it is nice to relax playing coin dozer
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|It's a ok game but it's still fun to play it from time to time,also I really spend most of my time on different games
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I`m a fan of Bruce Willis and love his movies, but this one kind of fell thought the cracks as far as I`m concerned
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I was semi disappointed with this book. It is as if the authors books prior to this one were so successful that he had a hard time writing this one.<br /><br />At the end he stated that he broke this book and the next one into two separate ones to discuss the characters. So this book did not have quite a few characters from the first three books mentioned at all and the 5th will be solely about them and not the ones mentioned in this book....I think I just confused myself. Does this mean there will be a 6th book to close them all out?????<br /><br />I have come this far so I will continue on.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I saw a lot of good reviews for this game so I downloaded it and tried to open it but it wouldn't load after I hit play it went to the loading screen and started to load but then my screen froze so I hate if it would load then probably I would like it but it wouldn't load!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so interesting and it challenges your brain in so many ways.<br />Lovely remake of Temple run.<br />Have fun playing!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My nephew is a die-hard Iron Man fan and he really enjoyed this game. It worked really well on my Kindle  Fire.
B000NY12CI|4.0|This book kept my attention even though it was out of my usual genre (more fun and relaxing)  she is so real and I really learned a lot about Islam while reading her story.
1427233748|5.0|Five and a half stars! What a delight! Ari Fliakos really brought this book to life with his reading. The perfect voice for this wonderful story. I would put on my earbuds and a smile would fill my face. I just couldn't wait to get back to the tale. Robin Sloan's writing is wonderful, creative, funny, down to earth and high flying all at the same time. My husband and I both listened. We were delighted when one of us would get ahead of the other. We would then have a chance to listen to the previous chapter a second time. So fun to laugh out loud together. Really a lovely uplifting book. Pick it up! It will make your day!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very creative game.  I love that each room is unique.  Challenging but not exasperating.  Very addicting!  You will love it.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I'm hard to keep entertained and I finished this book in just a couple sittings. Great way to keep the series going.
0307271080|5.0|Other reviewers have commented on the story, the characters, and the focus on race in the novel, but for me the most compelling element in the book is Adichie's sensitive, ironic, sophisticated dissection of the immigration/migration experience. She writes with humor and a great depth of understanding of the clash between the dream of new beginnings and the joys and disillusionments of actual, voluntary emigration. She understands both the magnetic, irresistible force of the attraction to the Center that is engendered by growing up on the periphery of the old empires, and contrasts it unsentimentally with the multi-layered realities that have to be dealt with when the dreamers confront the often harsh realities of displacement and loss in the new world. Adichie's characters are products of a newly affluent Africa who are looking for personal enrichment and fulfillment, a far cry from the stereotype of the immigrant as an economic or political refugee, a person displaced by vast historical processes. A fresh treatment of old themes, this novel should be read by everyone interested in the current debates about immigration and multi-culturalism in America and the UK.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first read the book I just couldn't put it down! This is the most amazing book I've ever read! I recommend everyone to read it! It's worth it!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|One of the best stories that I have read in a long time.  Filled with intrigue, it was  still  remarkably  human. I  would recommend it to anyone that likes action packed books.
B00005JKGK|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie having to do with cross-cultural, cross-generational relationships in the context of timeless mother/daughter relationships.
B005D4YOWI|5.0|I have tried sandals a couple of times and have never felt comfortable in them. These are the most comfortable to wear and be seen in. They feel so good on my feet I hate to,take them off. No break in required.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|I am usually a big Tom Cruise movie fan but this movie may be his worst. This movie's plot is long and drawn out. We watched this with my extended family last week and half of them left before the movie was over. Has some backside nudity (pool scene)which may make it inappropriate for teens. The movie plot can be summarized by 4 words Captured--Cloned--Controlled-Overcome.
B004LLDN3A|4.0|I got it for my granddaughter to watch. She likes it and watched it more than once. Three more words.
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|By the end of this movie you will by asking a lot of questions.  Quite frankly, the story is incredibly thin.  And the characters pretty emotionless, though that may have been partly intentional.  The visual and technical aspects of the movie are amazing.  Great visuals and sound design.  It leads me to think this director, who also directed the more recent Tron remake, should perhaps be more of a visual effects director and not in charge of the whole film.  In the end the movie was pretty forgettable.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|This is a program that does not take much brain power as still remains entertaining. It is a show that I will watch more than once.
B00BTYP6QE|1.0|When i got on the game it didnt even work!!<br />I couldnt  slide my finger to start the game  it keeps telling me to get. On another app
B0043WHRWA|5.0|Great writing and acting. Good entertainment with a touch of mystery. It makes me laugh. I needed 5 more words.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I grew up on Disney, and have come to expect great things from them.  I saw Wall-E when it came out in theatres, but my roommate had told me that she never saw it.  Fortunately Amazon had it!  I was really excited to watch it again and to seen my roommate's reaction.<br /><br />Disney and Pixar really just delivered on this movie.  Telling a story in mostly &#34;wall-eee&#34; and &#34;eevaa!&#34; is just, well, incredible. As the joke goes, &#34;Still a better love story than Twilight.&#34;  And it is.  Wall-E gives up everything he knows to help EVE, the humans realize how lame they've become, and everyone gets to come back home.  Wall-E is full of feels, laughs, and beautiful moments.  10/10 would watch again...and again!<br /><br />This was my first rental on Amazon and I'll definitely be renting more.  I like that I can change the quality (which was nice b/c my bandwidth got upset) to accommodate how much traffic is running on my network.
B00CFA222M|4.0|Jack the giant slayer had a good story line and was very entertaining. The special affects were awesome and could easily watch again and again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love everything about this game. It keeps my mind extra sharp. My grandchildren can't stop playing this game. When they're around, I have to time them so they take turns. Thanks,
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I was a little disappointed in the story line? 'the story line was a bit confusing with the sister and mother?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game has decent graphics, with a good variety of puzzles.  Fun and just challenging enough without feeling frustrated.  Ready for more!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great way to unite his two best characters! What's next? I am ready for more! Paul and his love interest?
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I would LOVE this game if only it wasn't buggy.  In the beginning intro, their clothes & glasses blink a lot, very annoying.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Gets the brain working lots of fun better than a lot of other puzzle games I have played such as 100 doors level up and lots more<br />I hope the next levels are as good as the first ten I played hopefully there are more to come keep up the good work
B0014NDXGA|4.0|This device is great, easy to use. I really like the ability to point and click at anything on the course.  The only downside is it is hard to tell what you are aiming at sometimes.  Several times I had to shoot a pin three or four times because of a tree in the background being picked up
1451695195|5.0|A thoughtful, intelligent telling of the incredible journey Dr. Alexander experienced.  I recommend this book to all my friends and anyone who has an open mind regarding the hereafter.  An absorbing, uplifting read.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Worth the expense.  Most important is that this provides excellent voice quality to those whom you would be calling.  I've tried other headsets that sound great to me, but the recipient of my calls would complain about the background noise or the quaility of my voice.  I've tried other Motorola and Plantronics headsets, all of them get the job done but ultimately I would get complaints of the quality.  This is the first headset, where I've not had one complaint.  I love the fact that the headset disconnects automatically once I remove it from my ear and more importantly it will not accidentally make a a while in my pocket.  Excellent quality, excellent experience, hit head set is not cheap, but worth every penny in my opinion
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I thought this was a good book. I've been encouraged to read Jodi Picoult's for quite some time. This was my first read. The characters were written well. It raised some questions about family interference in peer relationships.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love it cant wait for next in the series. How long do we have to wait for the next book?!!
140006922X|4.0|I have a sneaky suspicion that the one star reviewers didn't read the book.  Many of the things they accuse the author of doing are not in the book.  If this book was some big campaign to turn me into a Muslim, it failed.  I read it and thought it was interesting.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Ok, well AA are back in rare form. If there was doubt that they had slipped or lost a step, well this will change your mind. Great cd and alot of epic fun. the bonus is good too. they wrote their own songs in the form of 4 bands that influenced them instead of just doing a cover. very cool. Must own and very very epic viking metal. good price for what you get song wise too.
020161622X|5.0|&#34;The Pragmatic Programmer&#34; is a philosophic book. While the authors discuss technologies and best practices, they truly aim to hone the outlook of the reader, to refine his or her view of the craft of programming. A common thread among readers of &#34;The Pragmatic Programmer&#34; is the intention to return frequently and dig deeper, as the book both instructs from a high altitude and provides an extensive bibliography for further study.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is an excellent book and deserves the occasional reread as one gains more experience in the field.
B00C70FG2S|5.0|Solid, Reliable, and yet moving forward without losing sight of past. I really like this cd. DT nailed it. However it took me a good solid 6-7 listens of whole thing to grasp what the feel and mood was. It is a very very good album and worth owning. In a world of hype and disappointment in the form or releases and trying to change for no reason at all, DT stays true. Very good
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Like everything, esp critical weather updates for my area, since we have all kinds of bad weather including tornadoes and hurricanes. Would kidnap with radar better if more could be shown, I.e., radar, clouds, and temps. More combos, not just temp alone, etc... Thanks, great app!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I cant stand TC. I was very surprised that it was good. solid story, action and plot. a good movie to rent and just enjoy. Even TC as an actor was not as bad as i was thinking.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I'm still getting caught up on Season 7, but I absolutely love this show! I can't wait to finish this season so I can start on Season 8.  Always keeps me on the edge of my seat.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I have enjoyed playing this- but between having to wait for new lives- and having some of those lives disappear while I am playing has discouraged Me from enjoying this game. I have noticed that between 2-4 lives randomly disappear while I play one life out- and often rewards for finishing a level don't credit after I am told I have them (specifically the gold bars)...this had fustrated Me to the point I am about to stop playing. its a shame- the game has potential.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|woth re-reading again, each time I read this story I pick up things in the story that were not clear the first time I read it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|After spending the last 12 hours with the Chromecast hooked up I can firmly say this is worth 35 and then some. Lets be real, if you have a crappy WIFI connection guess what, your results will stink....junk in and junk out, streaming video requires a good connection....that being said I have a solid Asus router that covers my entire house with 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WIFI with no issues so this little bad boy get 5 bars on every floor.  The coolest feature is being able to sling chrome tabs to your TV....I spent the night playing videos on Disney.com for my daughter and playing them full screen 720p High Bitrate with out a single hiccup....the Netflix and Google Play Music/Videos functionality works without a hitch in 1080p (right now you can only sling Chrome Tabs in 720p since it is a beta feature)  You really cannot go wrong for $35 it has the potentional to make you a cable cutter since you can sling videos in Chrome tabs without an issue...check it out yourself and ignore the idiots giving the device a 1 star when they have not even tried it yet.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|It's addictive I like it a lot! So does my daughter in fact she plays it more then I do it's hard to get it away from her
B0026HUQ9K|5.0|I have used strengths finder with my team for years.  It is a great way to learn about them and how to develop their strengths.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I LOVE this game it is my favorite game can't stop playing this game<br /><br />it is the best game ever
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|This game has great graphics and that's it. Was not impress at all with the game. It was not for me.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Works well on kindle fire HD. Makes u think while playing.game could have been a little bit longer. Game is worth buying
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Excellent debut series. Lots of action sequences and then there is the drama between all of the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the flash backs of Oliver stranded on the island.  Though the entire first season each character was cast extremely well. I can not wait for the next season to begin so we can finally learn the extent of damage done to The Glades and what will happen to the higher ups that initiated the decimation of the Glades.
030758836X|3.0|Okay so this is a descent book however, it was way overhyped for my liking. I thought this book would be ground breaking or at least new. But I've watched movies on Lifetime, i've seen real life stories, that have more suspense. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the book I just thought the hype over it was not worth it. I did make me rethink marriage through. I think this is where the media is turning, bad marriages in general.<br /><br />I feel like everyone should read this but should keep there expectations reasonable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game I would have liked to keep going. Ten levels is not enough. I hope more levels come soon.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I think this bingo game is a lot of fun.  It's a fun twist on the game of bingo.<br />.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love this game it keeps my mind thinking and its up to me to complete each step of the way.  Its hard to stop playing. but life goes on and theirs always tomorrow.  You won't be disappointed with this game.  No fighting or killing right up my alley.  Very easy to get it on my Kindle. I now have something to play when away from home.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Well done. Casting was very good as was the story line. Clint at his best. I enjoy it over and over.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This should be mandatory for high school students.  I found I could not put it down once I started reading it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Wow! What an imaginative book. The best way for me to explain the overall tone of the book is to say that it is like reading a Salvador Dali painting. This is one of the most original books I have ever read. Phantasy, mystery, horror, philosophy, theology and suspense are all present. I read this book in one sitting until three in the morning.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|I didnt know till after i had finished reading the book that this was meant for 'Young Adults'... I'm an 'old adult', who's normally too diffident to write reviews but this book moved me to tears and touched me deep inside. I think what i liked best about it was that all the characters were very true to life and people you could instantly relate to and empathise with. Hazel, Gus, their respective parents, even Isac...each one so sensitively and realistically portrayed. I would recommend this book highly to everyone but it would have to include a caveat- its desperately sad, so dont read it if you dont want to cry....
B00A8KJN14|5.0|great animation, great story, I had not seen the original short before I bought this and was happy to be able to see it on this dvd
B0000EEPNL|4.0|The movie, so far, is better than the book, but since it goes more slowly it will end up being very good also.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|UPDATE: I wrote the review below when the Netflix promo was going on.  It seems that promo has been canceled, so just disregard mentions to it.<br /><br />I got the last one at my local Best Buy (sorry to everyone behind me).  If you are currently paying $8 per month for Netflix than this Chromecast will effectively cost you $11 after you apply the 3 months of free Netflix to your account.  For $11 I rate this between 4-5 stars.  I want to rate it 5 but I'm having 1 issue with it that I'll get into in a minute.<br /><br />Setup is easy.  Plug the unit into the HDMI outlet of your TV.  If your TV's HDMI does not supply power (mine doesn't and I just got it last month) you have to use the included USB power adapter (or you can plug it into your TV's USB port if you have one).  After switching to the appropriate HDMI input on your TV you'll see the Chromecast prompting you to visit a website on you PC.  At the website you'll download the Chromecast setup app, run it, it will detected the Chromecast(s) on your network (if it works), name them, enter your network key, and you're done.<br /><br />The app will automatically install a new Chrome browser extension on your PC.  A little button that you can click to mirror the webpage onto your TV.  I tried it on some simple webpages and some streaming media sites.  The simple text websites mirrored perfectly.  The streaming media mirrored but was a bit choppy (they were Flash format I think).  Using the YouTube and Netflix Apps on my Iphone to stream movies to it worked without problem.<br /><br />Another really cool feature is, if your TV is CEC enabled, the Chromecast can turn on your TV and/or switch to the appropriate HDMI input when you send a stream command to it.<br /><br />Now for my one issue; the app you need to download to your PC to activate the Chromecast on your network did not work on my desktop PC.  It's a Win7 pc connected to my router via Ethernet (router is dual-band).  So I tried the app on my Win7 laptopconnected via wifi to the same network and it worked.  Once the Chromecast is activated you don't need the PC unless you want to mirror something from Chrome.  Google's help page states this issue may happen on dual-band routers and I should deactivate \\"AP (access point) isolation\\" in my routers settings.  I couldn't locate any setting similar to that so I have a help request pending with Google.<br /><br />All in all this is good for $35 and Epic for $11.  It won't replace my Roku, but I'm excited to see all the Chrome extensions and Apps that will be designed to work with it in the future (XBMC I'm looking at you).<br /><br />PS: If anyone finds a work around for that setup issue please comment.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This  is an action packed fun filled thrill ride movie that keeps you wanting more and more Marvel comic adventures . What's next ?

B004ZJZPXO|5.0|What a wonderful series Firefly was.  Too bad they had to start killing off people in the movie... woops, spoiler...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Works great and is lot of fun when I am bored. I am only reviewing this for diamonds though but it's really fun!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Yay Firefly!  Such a great movie.  Wish they never stopped it.  Still going stong on DVD and Blu-Ray discs though.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|This is a great book I loved reading about the adventures of Hazel and his friends. It's one adventure after the next.
006178480X|4.0|Good book with a good plot with lots of twists and turns.  Rather fanciful but perhaps logical when higher math and science are considered.  I really do enjoy James Rollins' books.
B00CCXL9OE|3.0|It was not the best I thought it would come with another disk not just the blue ray the quality is good just wanted the one thar Disney sold
B0086700CM|5.0|Gavin a lot of fun playin this game. a lot harder than it looks to do.  will probably download temple2.  I'm addicted.
B005V5WBFG|4.0|I have Mcafee for my laptops so it was a no brainer to get it for my Kindle Fire. Very happy for years.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|wow! this is a really great game!!!! i stay up till like midnight!! i want to marry the game creators!!!
B004GXZ69W|5.0|Excellent size for a small hand, great responsiveness and the wrist pain is almost gone after 2 weeks of using it.
B00DBSZEH2|1.0|I generally watch movies I rent all the way through, this one I turned off halfway in. The characters are flat. The witches aren't really that scary or interesting. Music is entirely forgettable. To be honest, as far as I can see, it's all about the gore. Which I would expect from a horror flick, but this looked like a fantasy in the trailers. So, don't waste your money like I did.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I read James Burke and will see any movie based on his books.  I hoped for more from this one. Maybe it was the editing or<br />directing, but the story did not flow very clearly.  The confederate officer was great, though.  Tommy Lee Jones and the other actors are all good and fit the roles.  It just didn't hang together.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This movie was really well done. Family friendly and the characters are really cool (I'm looking at you Santa Claus).
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What is past is present and the present draws on the past. Or does it<br />As always there is more than meets the reader´s eye in a Neil Gaiman book. The world viewed by a seven year boy who experiences the wonder of a true friend, the horror of the normal turning nightmarish, and the difficulty of parsing the meaning in the veil between world's. Another conundrum of a story that I will gladly recommend to friends.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I love this stylus.  I had a regular stylus and kept hitting the wrong end on my Kindle Fire HD LTE.  I was so happy to find this stylus.  It has three different sizes.  The smallest size is the one I use for Draw Something.  No more mistakes of using the wrong end.  Thank you Amazon basics for this addition to my accessories!
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This is a first rate page turner, and the rich detail with which he surrounds the story set in wartime England makes it all the more believable - at least until the very end, But by then I was so trapped in the story that I couldn't put it down.  A great summer vacation read.
B001QWBM62|2.0|The USB bus does not work so I could not connect it to the computer, and use it as a DAW (major reason for purchase). The included  Cubase software did not come with product key.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|It follows along in the same universe of Miles Vokosigan which was always very entertaining.  I look for more in this series.
1423113454|4.0|book in good condition, fast shipping, smooth transaction.  Just started book but it is holding my attention and expect it to be good to the end
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I enjoy being able to look at any location that I want to.  My family is spread out across the many States and being able to what is going on there is a plus for me.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie engages audiences of all ages and definitely puts a smile on your face. Plus the soundtrack is phenomenal!
B00821OX98|4.0|Never liked Noah Wyle for some reason but he does a good job here. Just hoping it doesn't degenerate into a soap opera the way shows sometimes do.
030758836X|3.0|It's a mostly clever story of a wife who frames a husband for her disappearance and presumed murder. However, it's marred by a few flaws and a tepid ending.<br /><br />The writing switches back and forth between the viewpoints of the husband and wife. This is interesting but the problem is that they fail to significantly differ in patterns of thought and expression. It sounds almost like the same person.<br /><br />The wife's scheme and actions are extremely complex and it isn't believable that the police and FBI cannot poke holes in them, especially with the insights and information provided by the husband. The plot builds to a crescendo and then just fizzles out with an ending that lacks credibility (spoiler alert). If you knew that your spouse had maniacally plotted to destroy those who crossed her in the past, framed you for her fictitious murder and just killed the last person who offended her, would you live under the same roof?<br /><br />The reading is intriguing. But don't start it unless you're prepared to be disappointed in the end.
B008L34P2C|5.0|Great movie: Special Effects are amazing this is my favorite! Anyone who doesn't like it obviously has bad taste seriously you'll love it!
1593272200|5.0|This book has tons of good information, & very clear. I don't see how this book could have been written any better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it keeps my little brother and I busy we love it we play it every day its a hobbies thanks Mojang (: good job on the graphics too
B00AEBB9K0|5.0|If you'd like to laugh for a couple of hours get this movie! Goodnatured fun about two male models, wrapped around a crime story, rivalry and family feud with plenty of good and bad stereotypes thrown in will keep you entertained and help you forget about your life for a while :)
B001974DG0|5.0|I just reread this book for the first time in a few years. It still makes me gasp, and cry and laugh with joy. It is now, and always has been, the most amazing book I have ever read.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I use this to house my canon t3i. It fits in just right with some extra space left. Has side pockets which holds stuff like my point and shoot, batteries, chargers etc. Built is nice and sturdy. Belt strap is a big plus for me. Perfect size for anyone who is medium built- male or female.
B004VFN7BE|4.0|Love the twists and turns and the acting is excellent.  The plot is a bit predictable but the outcome is worth the ride.
1568363931|5.0|This bento cookbook gives very helpful insight to menues and the use of left-overs. How to pack the meal and some freaking awesome recpies!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Great digital CD for a great price.  I love her and all of her music.  :)  Awesome album and I don't regret buying it for a second.  The kids love it, too!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I had to replace my Logitech G9 mouse after about 5 years because the left click began to double click on it's own.  I do not regret taking a chance at a \\"lower\\" end mouse name and save some cash.  Looks awesome and doesn't feel cheap; about up to par with my old G9 at more than HALF the price!  It could be heavier since I put all the weights in that it came with but acceptable, none the less.  The side button closest to the rear of the mouse is in an odd spot and sometimes gets clicked by accident in the heat of battle if I grip the mouse a little too tight and a little too far back with my thumb.  The software is easy to use and very customizable.  I don't understand why people say that this is a \\"starter mouse\\".  I've been PC gaming for 15 years and this is one of the best gaming mice I've ever owned!  I highly recommend this mouse!
B00280LYIM|4.0|Action, a love triangle, and a Labyrinth full of mystery? What can I say except... this is another must read by Rick Riodan. The Percy Jackson and the Olympians series truly does belong on your \\"bookshelf\\" right alongside Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles of Narnia = 0)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved these books! I just might have to re read these books in the near future. Titty sprinkles.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|When their first cd came out I totally loved it and their second one Rocked pretty damn hard too, but this one Totally Blew Me Away. I love It. The only thing I would change about it is that it just isn't long enough other than that Black Dog Barking will leave you wanting to Rock All Day and All Night. AAA+++
B009NY43NY|2.0|Truly Charlaine Harris turned on Sookie, she turned her into a raging unlovable b!Itch!  As an avid fan of the Stackhouse series who reread the series over and over during a long convalescence I am so disappointed!  I feel like an old friend has died and there will be no funeral.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|This is truly a Classic SFI horror/action/adventure. It's like going to the world's Greatest Theme Park and having it go bezerk, a true adventure right to the end. Awesome Classic Movie. AAA+++
B003XRELEI|5.0|One of Vonnegut's best. Read and reread. If you enjoy post modern works, this is a great intro to Vonnegut's style and charm.
B00BSJ2YVA|5.0|Listening to Kadavar, is like going back to the 70s and putting the the best of Sabbath, Uriah Heep, Hawkwind, and Zepplin all into one band and coming up with KADAVAR. These guys Rock the way Rock should sound keep them coming like this and you can't go wrong!!! AAA+++
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the game. makes me laugh every time I play it. kids love it,and it's hard to get them off the game. good for long road trips....Lol
B008JFUNYG|4.0|Still thought the original was scarier. But this one did have some pretty cool fx and some awesome scenes. Enjoyed it very much but like I said maybe I am just a classic type guy but thought the original creeped me out more so than this one. Was waiting for a couple things to happen that just didn't and was kind of bummed out at that but was VERY HAPPY TO SEE B. C. in it and it also still had the referance to Michigan in it still that ROCKED!!!! AA++
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|What good is this game if I can't play it? It will not open on my phone. I can not find a fix. No stars as far as I am concerned.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|You get to see how smart and interesting the characters are.  I watched season one & two from HBO and this, of course, as most books are, much more interesting and detailed.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I have always liked Tinker Bell  and I have a few of the other movies so I wanted to see this. If you love the Disney Fieries as I do you will love this.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love it. Easy to use. Easily see weather in all my favorite locations.  Great for seeing upcoming weather too. Great download.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Okay I have watched Star Trek since I was a child and  I was unsure at first about the new path but I like it and hope to see more.
B00CDUVDEC|4.0|First off, I gotta say to anyone who does not enjoy this album, what the hell were your expectations?  Seriously.  Did you not listen to the split he did with Warbeast earlier this year?  C'mon.  Do you know who you're dealing with here?  This is not Suly Erna or Dave Draiman.  If you like mainstream modern hard rock/metal and listen to FM radio stop reading this right now and shop for something else.<br /><br />I think because this is a 'solo' album, fans are expecting something a little more mainstream, a la \\"Vulgar Display of Power 2.0.\\"  Not happening.  Not a problem.<br /><br />Of course, the style of 'Exits Only' is not easily definable.  To put it simplistically, \\"Walk Through Exits Only\\" is less the hardcore of Superjoint, and more the grindcore of Soilent Green.  If you're expecting to bang your head to predictable 4/4 grooves, well you can forget about it.  The music seems to be constructed around the lyrics, in many instances, and this calls for a less constant beat; traditional song structures do not apply. Anselmo retains the anger, but his words are more introspective, personal, self-deprecating.  For a non-Down effort, it's refreshing for him to let the guard down a little; not so much in presentation--but in substance.  He's vulnerable.  Gone is the nihilistic, stone-cold ugliness of the Superjoint era; there's a little more 'uplift' to the anger.  The man is 45 years old and off the hard drugs, and you can tell it.  He's more productive.  His persona comes across like he used to in the pre-Far Beyond Driven days; more humorous, more spirited.  He doesn't feel the need to stew and flex as much anymore.<br /><br />In brief, the music, production, and mix are excellent.  Anselmo's band is tight.  For his vocal attack, he sticks to his mid-range roar, but utilizes his 'black metal'/Trendkill-esqe screech a little, as well. Montazeri's guitar fills and few solo breaks are excellent.  His whammy bar dives and squeals are reminiscent of a certain late, great guitar virtuoso who shared the stage with Anselmo in their previous band.  Wink, wink.  There are some striking ambient segments.  I would suggest listening to the album on a stereo with a subwoofer and/or headphones in order to appreciate the mix.  The bass guitar fills the plane perfectly between the deeper registers of the guitar and the kick drum. On most metal albums, the only time to really hear the bass, is when the guitar or bass drum attack drops out for a bit, but here the bass has its own constant frequency and is audible throughout.<br /><br />Bottom line, these songs sink their hooks in and grow on you.  They are challenging, but the song structures are so erratic (in a good way), it makes the listen that much more entertaining.  The album stays fresh, and you discover more nuances upon repeat listens.
B004ZG5F28|5.0|When you want to watch Bridg and the gang's adventures at full HD resolution, there's only one way to go - this disk.<br /><br />The picture is very clear, you can really enjoy the art and set design. You'll see loads of details you missed on DVD!
B00BB22GSU|5.0|I've always loved Vampire Weekend and I was extremely nervous that this was going to disappoint me. This absolutely deserves all the praise it's received. The songs flow wonderfully and Ezra's voice is fit snugly into the music. This album features some of the very best songs Vamp Weekend has ever written: Ya Hey, Hannah Hunt, Diane Young, Step, and Worship You are so exquisite and original that it blew me away.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've had it for 4 years and still love it so. some people on my swimming team say it's the worst app ever they just don't know how to have fun
B009C7JS14|3.0|The app tells you what the weather is outside. I suppose it could work for some other location, but I have not tried that.
B002N44XSG|5.0|i read it in an hour ot two. wish it was longer but really, who cares. and even though most dont read this i hope u enjoy the book.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|For some reason i was warned that the app might not work for me and it does not. I have a Fire, but I have been charged but it has not downloaded. A complete waste of money and much annoyance. Don't bother.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was going to give it a try because of Netflix promotion. Now that it has ended, I will wait to see what sort of complaints people are experiencing with this device. They should have kept the promotion going to boost the device popularity. Anyway, I am in no rush to have this device on my TV now as I already have something that already works. Usually, the first generation have flaw because they haven't perfected the issue yet. Just like their Google TV box that come out with Revue. It has problem with memory and I have to constantly rebooting the device to free up the memory. Occasionally, I have to do a factory reset because Neflix no longer play or connect.<br /><br />All in all I was so excited about this product when I heard the announcement, what they've failed to mention was that the Netflix promo will only last for x number of hours. Two stars for ending the Netflix promotion which would have lured more people in giving this product a try.
B008L5G4I8|5.0|Again, this Agatha Christie mystery was everything that I thought it would be. It stimulated my brain and was very entertaining. I will continue to read her writing and maybe attempt to write something myself at some point.
0142501247|5.0|The &#34;Spot&#34; books are a lot of fun to read with a toddler.  They can relate to little Spot and his adventures and the books are short, so they will re-read them several times.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like that it is easy to use and intuitive.  I dont like that it has to be open at all times or it stops playing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I never thought I would enjoy a period piece let alone a British one. I found myself completely immersed in this family and their staff. I could not wait to get on to the next episode. This series is brilliant.
B008G3N71W|5.0|Chloe Thurlow writes exceptionally well. What she writes might not be for everyone and certainly this book pushes the boundaries. It's BDSM erotica and so isn't required to have that much characterization, or a happy ending. Strangely though, the fact that this extraordinary `adventure' Greta May (the main character) experiences gives her confidence, and she achieves the success as an actress she longed for, is something of a happy ending. There is characterization.<br /><br />From the start Greta is portrayed as vulnerable, disappointed and it seems that within the unfolding of the story she sets out to succeed in this sexual adventure when she perceived failure elsewhere in her life. The men are described in such a way that a darkness descends around them, giving the impression that they are monsters.<br /><br />If you are not into hard-core BDSM erotica then this is not the book for you. It is shocking and yet it seems that Greta has to do what she does, it's a journey she embarks on right from the start that although she is submissive, is one of her choosing. Right at the beginning of the book, we discover that Greta has never been sexually excited and then...she is, and by something maybe many readers will find degrading.<br /><br />The author foreshadows later events in the book with phrases that refer to the almost surreal `pony girl' part in a very clever way.<br /><br />The catalogue of events in Greta's journey to experience more, and lose all sexual inhibitions spirals into the extreme in the last third of the book. Here it helps to remember how Greta spoke at the beginning of the book when she wanted something different, craved it, hated her shoe shop life, and how she saw what she experienced with Richard as a role she was playing.<br /><br />By the end of the book, it felt as if this story was a metaphor, a bizarre work of art to highlight debauchery and maybe how disappointment can send a person over the edge in some way (Greta's being sexual). (It reminded me for some reason of the painting, The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch.)<br /><br />Five stars for the exceptional quality of writing, description in the scenes, originality,and sheer grit that must have gone into producing the character Greta along with some of the harrowing BDSM scenes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Each episode is more intriguing than the last. I started watching the series on Hulu and Amazon and have caught up to current in two weeks. I love love love this series and I can't wait for season 4.
B009PJAC5K|3.0|This is the third episode I buy and the third time it stalls within 3 minutes of watching it. I have to stop wait a few minutes and then hit play again.  Its an inconvience and I hope it doesnt keeps happening in any future episode I may buy.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Haven't played too long yet, but I'm having a great time so far. Great for those who like to build and watch it grow.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|updated below>(I got a netflix promo from best buy. it gets even crazier with amazon, i cancel on the word that they won't credit me, and then i get an email saying i will get the promo when my order ships, but when i try and reinstate my order, they say no i can't. but then they gave me a $10 credit.)<br />I ordered my product on 24 July at 11:43 PM central standard time I had to call several places like others checking on the promotion making sure it was good for Netflix for three months and that it came with the chromecast, I called Amazon they were friendly but he did not have the information on the Netflix promotion he could not confirm anything so I spoke with a supervisor and received an e-mail saying that I would get my three-month Netflix however was kind of short on details so I am leery and I will update this post later on when I receive it. it was said that I would receive it within one week of receiving the product, but they also hinted that it may be in the product packaging I have no idea which story to believe I'm starting to think that maybe I should return it which is really sad because they would be lying if they don't honor this. It is nice to be able to leave reviews but they would have the biggest social network of all if they could let Amazon customers talk to each other socially. They will probably not do this because then we would have too much leverage to influence each other and make them honor their word on promotions like this. I also think Google was very shady because they did not specify when the promotion started or ended all they said was I would get free Netflix for three months so that is shady too.<br /><br />updated: this is crazy but they said it's just a misunderstanding. then they did a trick so that my emails bounced back to me. hilarious really if it wasn't so sad. anyway despite a promise, they backed out. amazing what a company will do to save 20 bucks in the short term, and lose a customer. this whole thing is a debacle.anyway, i gracefully canceled my order. shame on you amazon, you lack basic skills necessary to run a mom and pop store let alone a greedy publicly traded company.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|read the book before you see the movie. tense action . well writted. bit to much detail, but a good read.

0385738781|4.0|-Spoilers Below-<br /><br />When I first started this series, I was addicted. I tore through the first books like no one's buisness, but this one felt a little off. It seemed like these books were written by a different author. Here is what I think about some of the flaws and good parts (for lack of a better word) of this book.<br /><br />-I felt like half of the characters were left in the corner for half of the book. They just didn't feel important! (I'm talking to you Frypan, Aris, Group B) Did they have any purpose?!<br /><br />-Thomas felt no emotion towards Teresa, despite the fact that she was his best friend, and then tried to kill him.<br /><br />-Brenda didn't clash with Teresa at all, like she had earlier. She didn't even really have any romance with Thomas either until the end.<br /><br />-The only real emotion coming from Minho during the book is when they find Newt. It's like he doesn't care anymore.<br /><br />-Jorge and Hans were good supporting characters. They did their job well.<br /><br />- We never really figured out what, why, or how WICKED was doing what they were doing. The author hinted about how Rat Man might have the Flare once, but that was the end of that.<br /><br />-I liked how Newt got the Flare and how he wrote the note to Thomas. I just wish it had more importance, like a will instead of a command. I did like how Thomas was able to redeem himself.<br /><br />-Thomas kills five people, but does he care? Of course not! He just does whatever is nessisary to bring down WICKED and doesn't consider the consequences.<br /><br />-I kept thinking Thomas would eventually get his memories back, but instead he decides to live his whole not knowing his past!<br /><br />-The leves of violence and language went up alot in this book. Instead of feeling like an adventure, it felt like it was a zombie movie.<br /><br />-Halfway through, I realized I didn't want to read this book anymore. But I kept a it just to get it over with.<br /><br />-I hated how there was no quest in this book, unlike the others. Instead everyone just decided to visit some zombie, damage some vans, and blow up a complex filled with some innocent people.<br /><br />-What about the rest of the world? And were is this paradise anyway?<br /><br />Overall, this was a good book, but disapointing compared to its prequells. I give it a 8/10.<br /><br />  -Ginger, 114 Studios

6304779356|5.0|best soundtrack (favorite song i still believe-tim capello) lol<br /><br />They don't make movies close to this anymore.  Reality tv has replaced actors like Kiefer Southerland, and the 2 Corey's.
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|Good conditions, good image and sound. One of my favorites. I recommend it to all movie lovers and specially to all Woody Allen fans.
B001BANK32|5.0|I have seen the movie too many times to count, and read lots of Stephen King books, but after hearing that he is writing a new book with the youngster in it, I felt I had to read the Shining. It was insightful, as far as finding out the true real story, and almost better in some ways than the movie. I was glad for a few things that the book had that the movie didn't.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love the game, but is having the minions giving me the finger really appropriate for a game based on a kids movie? I would love to see that removed.
B00005ABKC|5.0|Tom Petty kept his promise that he'd keep this album priced below a-list stars at the time and he delivered another solid slab of wax.  \\"Hard Promises\\", (1981), their 4th album continues their hot streak.  \\"The Waiting\\", as Byrds as you can get, was a top 20 hit. (I can't believe this was their only top 40 hit on the album).  \\"A Woman In Love (It's Not Me)\\", we sang this a lot in college, a nice slice of rock & blues.  Other top tracks, the funky \\"Nightwatchman\\", the smooth \\"Something Big\\", \\"Kings Road\\", \\"Criminal Kind\\", \\"Letting Go\\", really dig \\"A Thing About You\\", covered by Southern Pacific in 1985.  Stevie Nicks helps 'em out on the soulful \\"Insider\\".  The hot streak continued in 1982 on \\"Long After Dark\\".
B000WD66BM|5.0|Came across this album on Pandora, along with Edenbridge.  The eclectic combination of genres from ballad, movie, pop, rock, metal, and even opera is masterful far surpassing the simplistic music of top 100 groups heard on radio today.  The artists behind this group are truly genius.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is a great action movie.  Lots of great cgi effects and explosions.  It brings all your favorite Marvel comic characters together in one place and showcases each one so you don't feel like they are just there as extras.  I am a big fan of Ironman and Robert Downey Jr. does a fantastic job.  Lots of great dialogue.  Fun from beginning to end.

1118488768|5.0|In the true spirit of my industry (investor relations and corporate compliance), some material disclosure: I am a featured case study in this book - thus I am probably far from unbiased to write a review.  Here is what I can report: I have received dozens of out-of-the-blue phone calls and emails from friends and acquaintances (some whom I have not spoken with in quite a while) proclaiming \\"Holy (beep), you're in this book!\\" After a brief, \\"aw shucks,\\" I ask them their view on the book. Without exception, all verify to David Meerman Scott's relevant, actionable advice and his accessible storytelling style. One friend even asked if I can get an autographed copy for him... which of course David sent!

B00DC7N9NS|2.0|1. It's amazing how James Franco can act in some movies and not in others. This one he can't. 2. They put the self-referential humor in the wrong places and it kicks the movie in the shins over and over again. 3. The pacing is fine, the effects are neat, but somehow this movie just doesn't have enough soul behind it. The characters aren't quite human enough, and so it's hard to care much, or for things like the kiss Oz gets at the end to be reasonable.
B00B780TAK|5.0|Could  not stop watching this show. Watched all 3 seasons and they were all sooooo good!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait for season 4.
B00BLSJI80|4.0|Demi's first album was near perfect. Her second album was alright. Her third was pretty good. This one? Eh. Too POP if for lack of a better word. I was really, REALLY psyched for this one and was understandably letdown. Don't let all of these 5 star reviews fool you (many of them only 2 or 3 lines of words and probably new fans anyway). There are some good songs on this CD but a lot of it is just overdone teen pop (who woulda thought she would have gone BACK to teen pop??! Weird decision after a more serious record like 2011's [[ASIN:B005EZJ3MW Unbroken]].)<br /><br />The consistently good songs to me are \\"Nightingale\\" (second best song on the record and definitely the best vocal arrangement -- Thanks Anne Preven!), \\"Made In The USA\\" (eventually really fell in love with the lyrics here) the upbeat \\"Really Don't Care\\" (with Cher Lloyd), top 10 hit \\"Heart Attack\\", the pretty ballad \\"In Case\\", the fun \\"Something That We're Not\\", \\"Neon Lights\\" (the most infectious uptempo track) and the highly emotional ballad \\"Shouldn't Come Back\\" which is actually the best song on the CD.<br /><br />Two things I didn't understand about the album are -- 1) There is quite a bit of a dance-y vibe on this album even after Lovato clearly stated that she was getting tired of hearing this type of music on the radio waves. I think she was pressured into this. And 2) Demi is a singer-songwriter at heart. She has been co-writing most of her material since her debut album generally as the main songwriter. Here her name is seen mostly at the end of the list of songwriters meaning that she wrote very little of the lyrics. I find this a bit shocking and quite discouraging. I want her to get back to writing the majority of her songs. She was doing it when she was way younger so she can sure as hell do it now.<br /><br />Basically I'm a little letdown by the album. At times it's a little too mindless pop and hence can naturally seem like a downgrade from what she achieved with her last release. I thought she was gonna grow even more than before. She did a bit; just not as much as she could have. It's a good album...just far from what I expected. Overall it's a solid release but I was expecting stellar.<br /><br />4.3 stars.<br /><br />(7/30/13) P.S. I now own the album (ordered it from Target's website) and I see that she was the main songwriter on a mere 3 tracks: \\"Something That We're Not\\", \\"Warrior\\" and the Target exclusive song, \\"I Hate You, Don't Leave Me\\". I don't want to seem like I'm bashing Demi--I hope I'm not coming off that way--but as a singer and lyricist myself I find that a little disappointing. She took control on writing the majority of the lyrics for her debut [[ASIN:B001DU8T6I Don't Forget]] so I honestly find it puzzling that she didn't write most of the lyrics for this one. But oh well--it still turned out alright.ught she was gonna grow even more than before. She did a bit; just not as much as she could have. It's a good album...just far from what I expected.

1451627297|5.0|Stephen King is one of the most prolific authors we have today, and after reading this I'm convinced he's also one of the best. Before reading 11/22/63, I thought of King as the JJ Abrams of novelists. Just like JJ's TV shows (Lost, Alias, etc.), the first 90% of King's books are almost always great, only to fall apart when the last 10% is hurriedly wrapped up, rushed, and loose ends are left hanging. If you have ever read King's [[ASIN:1439156816 On Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition: A Memoir of the Craft]], you will understand why this happens. King does not plot out his books - he creates characters and interesting scenarios, then follow the characters where they take him.<br /><br />If anyone has complaints about 11/22/63, it will be about length and the indirect approach of the narrator to the 'meat of the story'. It's true that there are many tertiary characters developed and that the set up takes quite a long time, but if you enjoy a good read then it will be worth it. I really grew to love all of the characters in the book and the initial storyline, while not JFK, fascinated me.<br /><br />This is a book that transcends genre and, though I have only read a couple of others by King, the best that King has written. He tones down the horror (though there are a a couple of grisly scenes) and the language is often R-rated, but the story is very good. I hate time travels stories, movies, shows, books . . . they are always so full of holes. King pays careful attention to this and has developed the most complete time travel narrative I've ever read.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. I actually listened to this one on Audible, and it was the best audiobook I've ever listened too. The narrator was absolutely the best I've ever heard, did a perfect job. If you are interested in King, time travel, good fiction, American history, or just an entertaining read - pick up this book.<br /><br />(Not sure if this is in the printed edition, but at the end of the audiobook King recommends the best book on time travel that he's read - [[ASIN:0684801051 Time and Again]] - I was happy to add it to my wish list after finishing this)ommends the best book on time travel that he's read - [[ASIN:0684801051 Time and Again]] - I was happy to add it to my wish list after finishing this)

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Nowhere does it say you cannot setup Chromecast with an ios device.  Your can use Android phone from not an iphone.  You also cannot setup Chromcast with a stand alone computer not using wifi.  You need a Mobile Computer/ stand alone computer with wifi or Android phone to even setup the Chromcast. You can set it up with an Apple mobile computer.  This is the first Google device I have bought and it will be the last.<br /><br />Post Script, Was able to borrow a laptop and it is setup now.  Sometimes it seems to lose the iPhone, but just shutting down the iPhone and restarting connects them up.  The streaming is working very well for me, even on an average DSL connection.  Hopefully I will get the Netflex rebate, time will tell.  I had ordered well before the cutoff time.  Other than the setup snafu and occasional burp with the iPhone I am every happy with it.  I will be keeping and hoping it continues to improve.  Could not give it more than three stars due to the setup problems.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Such a wonderful period drama.  Love all the wonderful actors and the gorgeous scenery. Can't wait to watch Season 4!
0767847431|4.0|In the original Sinbad stories the plot is as follows - Sinbad sails off to make money, ship is pushed off course or destroyed, crew all dies, Sinbad survives mostly from good luck, returns to civilization, cargo is found by somebody else, Sinbad sells it, makes profit, keeps it for himself, goes home, the end.  The movies seem to go in a completely different direction.  Most of the time his crew is not killed off, he rarely seems to do any trading, and he never really seems to end up wealthy by the end of it.  The Golden Voyage of Sinbad has a simple plot, with nice scenery, and good atmosphere but I find two things overshadow all those thing.  One, is the special effects by Ray Harryhausen.  We get a six armed statue, a one eyed centaur, and a griffin who is barely on stage before getting killed.  Really, seems more like a last minute thought.<br />The second thing I noticed is the people selected for the characters.  John Phillip Law as Sinbad is okay.  He seems to come across as brave, kind, intelligent, and somewhat skilled in sword fighting.<br />Tom Baker as Prince Koura is perfect!  The voice, the faces he makes when doing magic, his sense of timing and even the fake tan they gave him all make for a great character.  And he takes his part so seriously!  I was always waiting for him to call on K-9 or slip into the TARDIS.<br />Than there is Caroline Munro playing the slave girl Margoana.  You may have seen her before.  Not only is she a somewhat regular in Hammer films, but she was also in the first Casino Royale AND she played the helicopter assassin in The Spy Who Loved Me who gave Roger Moore's Bond that lewd wink.  She is more likely remembered as the poster girl for Navy Rum in 1970.  In other words, like most Hammer Girls she was also a Bond Girl.  But unlike most models, she was able to move into the movie and television industry without much of a problem.  In other words, she seemed to be a good actor.  And she does a good job in this move also - not that she got enough screen time.  The film is in color, 105 minutes and has a few features you may enjoy.<br />Why is it missing one point? Well, it does feel aged, and while the humor is nice the story does feel a tad off.  I am not saying there are plot holes as much as I did not feel as invested as I should.  Lemuria did not feel as dangerous as it could have and Prince Koura never felt as dangerous as he could have.  Why did Magoana's character have that eye on her palm and why was the griffin the symbol of good?  Needed more details.  This is a story of Sinbad - there should have been more wonder, fantasy, and magic.<br />So that is why it only gets four stars.that she got enough screen time.

The CD is fine but I mean I'm a CD collector and enjoy my CD's to have the booklet or hell just a cover photo, I mean it is literally just the CD in a clear case. I don't just upload music on an mp3 or anything nor do I download free music, I like to get the full effect and use from a physically compact disc. I'm a little disappointed that it was just the CD.<br />HOWEVER if you simply like to just download music and get a good deal this a good source, no tricks up their sleeves the products come fast and in good condition.

B009IJJ8UM|1.0|This is perhaps one of the worst adaptations of Sherlock Holmes by Dr Arthur Conan Doyle. In the book, Dr Doyle tried to emphasize \\"science of deduction\\". That was his focus and he did it through the character Sherlock Holmes. The character itself was not his focus. Most of the newer adaptations (including BBC series Sherlock) gives more importance to actors, their companions, locations, camera work etc. There is a very little emphasize on deduction capabilities of Sherlock Holmes. Fun is gone!!...<br /><br />This series is a joke. Irene Adler is Moriarty and was ex girlfriend of Sherlock. Watson is a lady...are you kidding me? It just makes the series cheap...<br /><br />A humble request to CBS and the team which created this; do not use character names from Sherlock Holmes book. Just use different names.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Shades of Jane Austen!  This series is just fun, with a smattering of history thrown in .  There's plenty of drama and suspense as well, to keep you wondering what will happen in the next episode.  I can't wait for season 4.

The hard-working denizens of the deep, whose stealth and cunning cost many lives, return home only to become the hunted in the U-Boat pen they came from!!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this trilogy! Already finished the first two book and I'm stoked about the final! I think the trilogy has a good story line and it's easy to follow. It's nice to read something that's not like other romantic novels.. This is more erotic and witty. There's always something shocking at every corner of the story, never a dull moment. And the little sarcasm and wit that's there can't help yourself than to laugh out loud.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|It was nothing like what I had expected. I guess if you are interested in interacting with others and using real money and gambling you will enjoy this game, but found it was not my cup of tea.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my favorite so far but I have yet to read the third. Without spoiling it for others the reason being is because the characters are more well rounded and the situation seems more, in lack of better term, 'beautiful.' The best way I can describe it, is when I'm reading it gives me a loving feeling. Totally different than the first book just because the characters have evolved so much. Really, this is the most addicting trilogy I have ever read!

B000W93CHC|3.0|Well, I read the whole thing and at the end felt angry with myself. I also felt utterly manipulated. I guess Follett's gift might be reeling 'em in and keeping 'em caught. Lots of violence - scenes and images that captured my attention but upon reflection I really don't want in my mind. Unbelievable rape scenes - clearly written by a man. Characters for the most part unidimensional but somehow compelling. Actually, the witch character was interesting and I think she's what kept me hooked. Follett clearly did lots of research on cathedral architecture and I tended to skip those bits - lots of jargon and visualization that was beyond my level of interest.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|Wanted to have an app that actually worked..don't care about cranking anybody....don't get this is just a joke app..:(too bad
B00506NRBS|5.0|Derek tells his one-of-kind story and doles out inspirational lessons along the way. For anyone who runs their own business or who has ever wanted to. Gotta love his go-against-the-grain-approach to growing CD Baby, and all the success it yielded. Read it!
B0053TMP24|5.0|If you love greek or roman mytholog then read this series it is the best book series i have ever read
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I've struggled with my faith but want to believe there is life after death. I'm not sure this book convinced me but it's good to know that the experience convinced a neurosurgeon dedicated to science. Smartly written though short.
B001KRVLCI|5.0|Great movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Way better than any temple run anyday. This game really makes you focus and for once you can enjoy being focused cause you're to busy laughing.
B00000K2UX|5.0|Great movie
B009POCG2C|3.0|I won't revisit the story line, as so many have already done that here. The story line is fine, although it could have focused on certain aspects that would have built drama. The tumultuous upbringing of Amy Adams character, as a result of her mother dying so young, should have been a focus, yet it gets two short scenes in which to build from. We get that she is a miserable person, but you aren't sure if it is because her personality was developed from agony or because she inherited her fathers gruff manner. There is just little character development.  For the baseball part of the story, which there isn't much, it is just barely okay. The scenery of all of these minor league ballparks in GA is great. Loved that! You really come to hate the star prospect that Gus and many other scouts are following. Although, he may be the best part of the movie! The baseball is atrocious. The concept that all these people are viewing a supposed regional prospect league with players that couldn't make a junior high team makes for a poor experience. I get it: the baseball is just the vehicle for the drama aspect of the plot. However, the baseball scenes are just so poorly played that you find yourself hoing thye are over.   Other parts are just rushed. The degrading of Gus' skills, the love development between Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake, the discovery of the hotel workers son as a major league pitcher are all just rushed and come off as hokey.  Last negative is that Amy Adams is just miscast. She is terrible in this movie. I mean, she ruins it.  So why the okay rating? Well, he ending is just great. I watch this entire movie just to see the last 5 minutes. The rest is just blah at best.

B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I usually don't jump at the chance to see sci-fi movies, but I really enjoyed this one. Not as predictable as a lot of alien invasion/end of the world type movies out there. And after seeing it in the theatres, I still enjoyed watching it again at home, the tell-tale sign of a good movie in my book.
B00004CY38|5.0|Love it
0985557834|5.0|J.D.s ability to demonstrate is unparalleled.  I have made several of the items he demonstrates, even being able to sell a few of them for profit.  I have seen other books of this type, and none compare to the clarity or quality.  Highly recommended (along with his other two books).

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wonderful little device simple to follow setup instructions for the most part. Small form factor means less clutter as well as being very easy to move, take with to another device. Once setup all you need do is plug it into any TV anywhere. Traveling and using your mobile hotspot just plug it into the hotel TV and you are good to go. If you go somewhere and cannot access your network and need access to a new one? Simply setup, it will find that network, you enter in the password and you are good to go.<br /><br />Of course for tablets you need the \\"chromecast\\" app. Download that before you do anything else. Also download the \\"remote cast\\" app as it will allow your tablet to do double duty as a remote control.<br /><br />Then plug the chromecast dongle into a vacant hdmi out on your hdtv. Next if you have a usb port on the TV just plug the cable that comes with in and then into the chromecast to power it. If no usb on the TV chromecast comes with a wall usb adapter so that works too. On newer sets you don't even need to worry about the usb power source as the hdmi is powered but don't count on that.<br /><br />Next your television has multiple hdmi outputs so you must select using your TV remote the correct one where your chromecast is plugged in, no different than selecting the one for say your Blu-ray player.<br />You will then see the initial setup screen. Before you get started be sure you know your network name and password as you will be asked. Start the process and soon you are done. It is very simple to do.<br /><br />Next is to set up your devices, from where you will be streaming content, tablet, pc or mac. It is a little different for tablets as opposed to pc's and macs. If you have a tablet at this point you are basically all done just need to set options and get familiar with using it.<br /><br />If using a pc or mac go to the \\"google chromecast help\\" webpage. Just do a search for that term. Using google search the first item in your results is the link you want. Under the heading \\"learn more\\" click on the link \\"get started with chromecast\\" it will guide you step by step even the step where you download the chromecast software to your pc/mac. After having done that just continue through the steps to get a feel for it. (on tablets you use apps directly such as Netflix and YouTube within each upper right corner click on the chromecast icon) but using the chrome browser on your pc or mac device you can mirror anything from your laptop/desktop to your chromecast enabled flat screen.<br /><br />Open the chrome browser then get the \\"google cast\\" extension. Once installed Click the Cast button in Chrome. Look to the upper right on your chrome menu bar and listed with your other extensions is \\"chromecast.\\" Sometimes depending on screen size you will need to left click on the >> double arrows to view all your extensions. Otherwise first time right click on google cast for a drop down menu. You will see at the top \\"options.\\" Left click and then you will see your device with either the generic name it came with or one you have given it during the initial setup process. Under options check automatic resizing and full screen zoom. Then depending on the strength of your Wi-Fi network signal choose the best display quality 720p+, 720p or 480i. Then simply close that tab/window.<br /><br />From then on when you are using the chrome browser and you want to mirror the image to the chromecast device all you need do is go to the upper right corner of the browser, left click on google cast and then you will see your device, \\"cast this tab to,...\\"whatever you have named your chromecast and just left click on that and momentarily your entire screen is then on your hdtv. Close the tab to end the mirror stream to your television. So be it the front page of cnn, espn or hbogo if you have a pc or mac setup you can get it all via your Wi-Fi network to mirror on a large screen, so long as that television is within your Wi-Fi network range. Ifnot or a weak signal do as I have and pick up a Wi-Fi signal extender. They range from $50 to $100 and can make a huge difference.<br /><br />There is much more you can do with the chromecast and more details I found the best to be at \\"techhive.\\" Again just do a search and then search there for chromecast. All this may sound a little overwhelming but it really is simple once you get going. It took me about 30 minutes to complete the install on three pc's and two android tablets. After that it took me about ten minutes become familiar with how to use chromecast with either the tablets from apps or the pc using chrome browser tabs. It's the best $35 I've spent in a long time.not or a weak signal do as I have and pick up a Wi-Fi signal extender.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Easier than some of the other room escape games out there, but that doesn't make this one bad or anything. Some of the levels are a bit repetitive (similar puzzles to solve in each), so I'm reading it 4 instead of 5 stars.

B005LZSJ66|1.0|I have never been a big Kasabian fan, so this review may be a bit biased. In fact, I only purchased this album (MP3) because it was on sale for $3, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Even at $3, this album is not worth the agony, anguish, anxiety that will surely ensue upon listening to this dreadfully dour display of \\"music\\". Go buy a bag of crisps instead.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun puzzle game. Looking forward to new levels. First ten levels went by too quickly. If you like Myst you will like this.
B003LXXEFG|5.0|If you need any more of a description than what's in my title, then maybe you should look elsewhere for music.
1451695195|5.0|This is not the only book I have read on this topic----but it is the best----you have to experience this story in all its dimensions----then you must roll it around in your mind and measure its many many dimensions against what you already believe as well as what doubts and questions you may have had. I can say that I am not only a believer but I now have faith that I can personally relate to  what he is sharing --- this is not so much a story he is sharing -- it is trip report documenting a journey we will all have to face one day --- and what a journey it will be.

0525421580|5.0|really great about a guy named Will Grayson, and a guy named Will Grayson, the chapters switch between which Will Grayson is the main character. each Will written by either Award winning and New York times best-seller John Green or Award winning David leviathan. their writing distinct emphasizes the difference between the Wills. though the way that David handles Dialogue takes some getting used useful, though he handles online chats great.<br />i feel this work like many involving John Green has some kind of deep meaning that we can all learn from.<br />the book is covered by a jacket, and underneath this it is completely black, i recommend reading with the jacket off, but put it on for protection in all other circumstances.<br />definitely a great read and a book John Green like many others can be proud he has written, if you liked this i recommend the other john green books as well, but specifically Looking For Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines, as they are both written in very much the same style.

B009FZFONO|5.0|I love the Walking Dead and this season is by far the best one yet. I was very impressed with everything in this series. I didn't want it to end. I watched in less than 3 days.
B00125WAWS|5.0|I love this movie because it shows that African Americans can learn. Too many have given up the struggle to be the best that you can be in a world that will always be unfair.  Education is wonderful and I encourage all blacks to be educated.  We also need more hard working, honest, God believing Blacks.
B003B02OOG|3.0|No one writes legal suspense like John Grisham.  He is a master at subtly and slowly weaving together multifaceted plots.  That aspect of his talent is lost in a short story.  Compared to his full-length mysteries, this one left me less than satisfied in the end.  Maybe he'll one day develop some of these chapters into novel length works.  That would be good.
B005UG542S|4.0|More entertaining than the first part of this final chapter, this was a good ending for an excellent series of books and movies. Sorry to see it end.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I truly truly loved the book. It gave me the insight of a very complex man so few understood. I couldn't run my company the way he ran his,but then again,he was significantly more successful than I.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|Thought this was the Life of Pi.  Could not watch more than 15 minutes.  Thought it was depressing and sad not what you want to watch on a weekend evening.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|Maybe this was one too many Lincoln Lawyer books for me. Very predictable ending. Instead of wanting to finish the book because it was so intriguing I wanted to finish just to be done with it.  Too many changes of direction and the Fifth Witness was a total waste.  Sorry just didn't enjoy it.
B000FC1JCQ|3.0|I read this years ago and bought it recently to re-read.  While I still like the story, I found it a bit long winded the second time around.
B002KC8BSO|5.0|If you couldn't tell by the cover or the title, Army of Darkness is a mans movie. It manages to be action packed and hilarious at the same time and the HD boost is a great improvement over its Evil Dead predecessors. With that said keep in mind that this is not a proper Evil Dead movie (which is probably why they left that out of the title) which means its really not scary like the other two or the newer one. But if you want a fun movie to watch with friends this is one that a highly recommend. Also on a side note I have to give props to Amazons Streaming - WORKED PERFECTYL, it was a relief considering I tried to stream it via PSN Video and it constantly was buffering for minutes at a time.
0345803485|5.0|I purchased this book used since I do not have room to keep books after being read.  The book came in great shape.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I use an Apple Cinema View display, and since it has the older style charger adapter, it wouldn't fit my new 2013 MB Pro. This little adapter piece does the job perfectly. Works with Cinema View, as well as my old MB charger. Nothing else to say.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|To begin, I am a pretty big Google fan, avoiding the Apple ecosystem, but I have become pretty discouraged as of late.  And I'm wondering if this is just one more thing that they'll get people to buy...only to stop any real improvements within a few months.  I really wish they would put the investment in time and money into the GTV devices.<br /><br />In reality, because of the 3 months of free Netflix, which brings this price to about $12, it is worth it just for the \\"play-around\\" value or for that 4th TV you have in the guest room.  However, this is not a 5 star item.  Just because it does what it says it will, that alone does not cut it for me.  Someone could sell a pet rock on here and say, \\"all it does it lay there\\"...but is that reason enough to give it 5 stars?  This is a media streaming device and you can't ignore how it compares to other streaming devices.<br /><br />Many have already listed pros and cons, here are a few that I haven't read about yet.<br /><br />1) Only TV Speakers - This plugs into your TV, so unless you have a setup audio setup that brings the sound from your TV to your stereo, you will be watching Netflix only through your TV speakers<br /><br />2) No Surround Sound - In an attempt to get the audio to my speakers, I plugged the Chromecast device into the HDMI input on my Logitec Revue.  (I don't run my Dish receiver through it anyway) It actually worked.  The sound did route to my stereo system, however, it was not surround sound...only stereo.  This same movie playing on Netflix through my PS3 was surround sound.<br /><br />3) Poor Browser Streaming - Streaming HBO GO from my Windows 7 computer's Chrome browser was less than satisfactory.  Obviously, this can be improved if you hard wire your computer to the router, but for many, that's not convenient.<br /><br />4) HDMI Port - Obviously, it takes up a HDMI port, however, Google did a pass through on their Revue Google TV device, why not do it here as well.<br /><br />To be fare, it does what it says, but what it does do, is pretty underwhelming.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is amazing I had 10dollars to spend and I picked this book and I'm glad  I do its very exiting
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Get this if you are only going to use it for netflix and youtube.  It works seamlessly with these sites.  However it is not ready to cast directly from chrome.  It has audio problems.  It streams very jerkily.  It was just not ready to put out for this purpose.  I will update my review if these problems are fixed.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I got this trilogy for an amazing price and love it.  Very nice packaging and the blurays are great - Aliens was a little grainy but that could be the original production and not the fault of the disc.

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Fast moving action packed Thriller with a romance involvement that has a great ending.  It will keep you interested until the end ...
B00881VLCE|1.0|I LOVED this app until it updated.  Now I can't move the pieces around - it's like my finger isn't connecting thru the touch screen.  I used this app daily until the update.  Now I have no desire to use it at all.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I just do not like this game. It is not entertaining to me. I will uninstall it. Not for me.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Another Tarantino classic. A great movie. That's all. buy it. Rent it. Just watch it. Do it now. On amazon. Couple bux...it's worth it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A great way to teach the kids about being responsible for a pet . The graphics are very good and appealing to the eye
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've heard so many good things about this trilogy that I had to read it myself.  I'm glad I did it.  I enjoyed every page.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  Kaleb was always an intriguing character and as the series developed his own book and place in the pantheon became inevitable.  Nalini Singh does an excellent job of presenting him as a very hard, dangerous, and still appealing man.  He is similar to Rafael in her Archangel series, but even darker.<br />The story line, which finally concludes the Psy-Changeling series is satisfactory.  (I was wrong here.  The series has continued.)  She had created a complex world in which there was no easy solution and she does not cheat in this conclusion,resolving it intelligently with honest complexity.<br />I believe my only reservation is her main female character, Sahara.<br />Sahara is charming and immensely likable but she is essentially one dimensional.  And that is the problem.<br />She loves Kaleb, he loves her, we can believe in his obsession with Sahara and his devotion to her, but it does not make a book.  I wish there had been less of Sahara and more interactions with the other characters which were much better written. I wanted real scenes between Kaleb, Hawke, Lucas and Judd.  While some are included, they are almost incidental. More is made of the Arrows which worked well, but the ones with the Changeling alphas are perfunctory at best.<br />I suppose it is difficult to write a romance with more than one male lead at a time, but an actual discussion with Kaleb and Hawke, two very strong alpha personalities, would have been worth sacrificing another love scene or two.  And for Kaleb and Sienna, the two most powerful Psys on the planet, to never encounter each other is a waste of a great opportunity.<br />So these are the reasons why I did not give this the 5 stars I wanted to.  But, I enjoyed the book, as I have this series, and sometimes a writer just taps out.  This is not what happened here. But it was not a TKO.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|G.I. Joe-Retaliation is equal to if not better than, G.I. Joe -the Rise of the Cobra. Great action, acrobatic fights, quick wit dialogue, overall a cool concept -c'mon, who doesn't want to rule the world. Two good successful movies under the G.I. Joe franchise... bring on number 3!!!

1400069289|5.0|I needed to read the book for college and as an incoming freshman I didn't want to spend to much money on books but thanks to amazon i was able to get it about $10.00 cheaper. I might actually try out the student off as well.

B004UID2LC|1.0|I absolutely loved this app until THE UPDATE! IT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR! It won't let you download out watch any music videos or music lyrics! TOTAL S***!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Well there is quite a bit of ads that show up about once every game, however, it's not too bad especially if you only play it every once in a while when you are waiting or such. Smooth gameplay, no freezing. Fun game. I've had it for 3 days, going good so far. You can skip the ads by tapping outside of the actually ad box, but on the screen, once, then clicking skip.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|But  I really like it so far. VERY different than the movie, I mean, not even the same. But good!
1781162646|3.0|Despite its cover and Hard Case Crime imprint, Joyland is really a rather sweet coming-of-age novel set in the small town carnival culture of the early 1970s.  This is not meant to say that the story does not involve elements of the supernatural, violence, or a thrilling \\"hold on tight\\" ending, however - because, after all, this is a Stephen King novel.<br /><br />Devin Jones, trying to forget the college sweetheart who has so broken his heart, decides to extend his Heaven's Bay, North Carolina, summer job into full-time work for the next year rather than to return to school.  Devin has made some good friends among Joyland's professional carnies and is proud of the delight he brings to small children when it is his turn to wear \\"the fur suit.\\"  So, for him, Joyland is the perfect spot to get his head together before returning to the school he so closely associates with the young woman who broke his heart.<br /><br />But all is not what it seems to be at Joyland.  One of the carnival's rides appears to be haunted by the ghost of a young woman murdered inside one of its cars, and Devin comes to suspect that others may have suffered a similar fate.  Intrigued by the stories he hears around the carnival, Devin starts to ask questions and to do enough historical research to leave him wondering whether a serial killer is still out there somewhere.  The closer he comes to the truth, the more danger he places himself and those closest to him in.<br /><br />Along the way, young Devin will learn much about life and love from the close carny friends he makes and from his relationship with a slightly \\"older woman\\" and her young son.  The boy, despite suffering a devastating illness, becomes one of the brightest and most consistently upbeat people in Devin's life, and Devin's relationship with the boy's mother is one he will remember the rest of his life - if he lives long enough to grow old.<br /><br />Joyland is about growing up, or - for the unlucky ones - not growing up, and the novel certainly has its emotional moments.  What it does not do is break new ground for its author.  Longtime Stephen King fans will feel right at home in the Joyland setting because King is a past master of tales like this one.  Joyland is likely to be a \\"comfort read\\" for most of its readers, but it will probably disappoint others who are left with a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling.the novel certainly has its emotional moments.

B000P407K4|5.0|A must view for all movie buffs, Having grown up in the duck and cover era this hits the spot
B0053O89WY|5.0|This show never ceases to entertain me! I love the constant wondering of the possibility of Leonard and Penny getting back together. Aside from that, Howard's relationship with fiance Bernadette usually makes you crack up from watching what goes on between them, but then even they have some moments that can be very touching. Not to sound like a total douche bag, but you gotta love the odd relationship between Sheldon and Amy. And Raj, (sigh) he'll be alright, I guess. It's just too bad that he can't talk to women unless he's drunk. (Chuckle)
B00BSN0K1C|3.0|While The Action Figure Is awesome and everything. As a collector the Box HAS to come in MINT condition. Unfortunately It did not. It had A MAJOR dent in the side of the box which was noticeable upon opening the Shipping Box.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Oh, wow! This show made me so excited when I first saw it, and I didn't really watch this show on the air. I have a habit of doing that. I started watching this show through Netflix. Every time I finished viewing the one disc that came in the mail, I couldn't wait until the next one arrived. I felt that this show was a good idea, it contained a great cast, and an interesting storyline. I often wonder if James Cameron himself ever watched the show, and if he did was he proud of what came about.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|One of the great movies from both sides and points of view. Just<br />a few bad moves created a situation that started a dreadful time<br />for so many-but we get to experience all that war brings. Leaves<br />us trying to understand to fight for what's right.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book was hard to put down.  It was a little confusing at times because it jumps back and forth between timed....but not that confusing.

B003O86FMW|1.0|I know this series was wildly popular, but after trudging through &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; I was told that it would be a better read for the two following books....couldn't get past the first chapter.  This is simply not subject matter that provides any interest or entertainment to/for me..Good luck!
B00479SVBU|1.0|The modulator to the FM has low volume and static but most importantly sounds terrible.  It lacks base and is somewhat distorted on the high end.  I tried several frequencies and gave up by using the aux out wired to the aux on my car stereo. Then the unit stopped working entirely about a week ago.  I tried to fix it but it looks like the voltage reducing circuit in the lighter stem is blown.  I wish someone would make a good quality device like this...

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am not an early adopter. The last gadget I bought the day it was offered was the the first edition Roku.<br /><br />Chromecast arrived today and is already proving to be a fantastic product.<br /><br />The Good - Setup takes all of five minutes. Plug it in, the TV detected it immediately and kicked it over to the HDMI inout it was on. Simple web set up and then connect it to your Wifi network and you're in business. To stream from Chrome on a laptop you just download the app and can then cast whatever tab you want to your TV.<br /><br />Netflix and YouTube on the iPhone are already good to go.<br /><br />Testing some videos from YouTube and Vimeo, the quality is fantastic.<br /><br />Another nice feature is the Chromecast automatically kicks over to the HDMI input if you're watching regular TV and click cast. No need to find your TV remote and press input.<br /><br />Semi-downside - Need to power via a USB port. Good news is that a USB port on the back of my TV makes powering the Chromecast a snap.<br /><br />Downside - Sites like Vimeo etc. don't have the ability to cast yet, so if you want to view fullscreen on the TV, you can't switch to another tab.<br /><br />Should be interesting to see what the app developers come up with for this device.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I was fascinated from the first page. I really related to the author's thoughts and feelings since I went through a divorce when I was in my late 20's. I never considered a hiking sabbatical, but sounds like it was an excellent way to figure out life.
B008MX7Z32|5.0|Bought this for my wifes laptop, but it serves many functions including taking it to the boat for light while I work on the engine and other things where a great light source is helpful.  Also much better than flash lights when the power goes out.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Well written with valuable insights, but somewhat repetitive and definitely depressing.<br /><br />Different setting both geographically and historically,<br />which gave one a perspective that was not run of the mill.

B000JMKQX0|2.0|I read most of it.  Good writing but come on, heroic story after heroic story.  I just got tired of it so maybe I'll try something in the children section as I am sure it is me since everyone else seems to love it.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I like movies that leave you feeling good about humanity.  This film did this for me.  Bobbie D was great!
B0081336FO|5.0|I'm glad I came to this show late. It would have been torture to have to wait between seasons. It's bad enough w have to wait until the end of the year for the next season.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Having had many close relationships with animals and bearing the grief of watching them die, this film made me a little weepy.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I like to read the books after the seasons are over and was caught by surprise when  halfway through, I had already finished where the show left off. The second half of the book has all the action and momentum that was missing in the first half. Season 4 is going to be awesome.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Quentin Tarantino makes some damn good films. This film is absolute nonsense, but I love it for it. Could I have chosen how to end WWII, I think it would be something similar to this. I am not a fan of mindless violence, but the excess in Inglorious Bastards was actually appreciated. It was artfully done, and I think it is better to show gore than pretend that violence has no consequences.
B00BSN0K1C|2.0|This Superman figure isn't very good. The sculpt bears a passing resemblance to Henry Cavill, but with what looks like a shaded stubble (as Superman he's immaculately shaven in the film). The plastic is soft, giving the figure a cheap feel, and the knees buckle under the  weight of the torso. The heavy also cape pulls him backwards. So don't expect him to stand on his own, you'll have to lean him against something. The base doesn't help much; there's only one foot-hole peg, and it positions him awkwardly off center. All in all, I was sorely disappointed in a figure claiming to be of \\"movie masters adult collector\\" quality.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This film make an excellent point about true villainy. I appreciate it. It is a 21st Century twist on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein... before Adam goes on a mad hunt for Dr. Frankenstein. More like what would happen if the blind girl he meets empowered him to be the hero he actually is. So, maybe not so much the plot line, but the point is the same. Villains are made and often against their will. It is easy to drive a person forced into villainy to be a villain at heart, but in the end the real villains are the people who forced it upon them.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really enjoy how the characters play off each other - great one liners.  Enjoyable show and can't wait to watch season 2.
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|The first Jurassic Park frightened the bejesus out of me as a kid. I recall watching it from behind the couch. Now when I watch it, there is no fear... sometimes shame when I watch it with my sister's 4 year old kid and they laugh when I was weeping... but it still makes me happy to watch.

B00785P2QC|2.0|It seems that this game is pretty good, it's not very hard to figure out. What I really don't like about this game and most others is that if you want to advance quicker, you must make a purchase.
1885167776|5.0|If you are a person who is fairly organized, and yet you struggle with too many things to do, this book may be one that can change your life. It gives a system for figuring out how you can best spend your time to produce the most results. It reveals the myths and mistakes that can keep you working harder and harder on your lists of tasks, and never quite producing results you like. This book has the potential to be a game changer if you have not yet mastered the art of knowing your priority. If you are good at knowing what your priority is at any given moment, you may still find the book valuable and interesting. And of course, some people won't like it. That said, it is clearly written by someone who uses the system exactly as it is described in the book and has gotten huge results from it. I highly recommend this book if you struggle with many tasks and too little time to do them all.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I enjoy this season because with the intro of Hook we see a new character and we aren't sure which side he will choose in the end also Mulan and Aurora are vital and interesting characters. The deeper exploration of Jefferson is great and having a classic literary character like Frankenstein included allows the fairy tale idea the possibility of expansion. I also am looking forward to seeing how it goes w/Peter Pan as a bad guy and what he wants with Henry also more Baelfire/Neal stuff will be great.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book picked up immediately from &#34;Girl who played with Fire&#34;.  There were a few slow spots but overall a very exciting book with a surprise ending!

B008220C56|5.0|Oprah's book club choice so many years ago - absolutely loved the way the story played out in the book - purchased a black & white staring Vivian Leigh in a 6 vhs video series (haha) of old love stores - watched the movie before finishing the book and could have &#34;thrown myself under the train&#34; for doing that!  This version was very different but very very enjoyable.  Loved it, loved, loved it for the story and will view it many more times.  Didn't especially care for the &#34;stage play&#34; effect but all in all the story stayed true behind it.  THANK YOU
B001609SQA|5.0|This movie is action packed scary and amazing for a movie in it's time(1986). If you are a fan of Alien or just plain out sci-fi this movie is amazing. I recommend this movie to fans of Alien or sci-fi.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is one of the best sandbox app's out there. Besides Exploration and Terraria but exploration is only on the Apple app store and Terraria is only on the computer and Xbox 360.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I would have given this a higher rating, but can't give half stars. Tom Cruise proves that he can still make a good movie, despite all the 'baggage'. I did find myself thinking about that during the movie, which was distracting. This was a good movie, nonetheless.<br /><br />Additional details:<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a drone maintenance technician in some future where mankind has had a war with an alien race. A war which has left the Earth mostly uninhabitable. A few technicians and their controllers remain on Earth to repair and maintain the automated drones that protect harvesters which create energy from seawater. The remaining humans are living either in the TET, a massive space station in orbit, or are orbiting Titan, a moon of Saturn. Once their tour is over, Tom and his controller, Victoria, are to transfer to the TET and then go to Titan. You see early on that Jack is dissatisfied with leaving the Earth, and finds beauty in small things, such as a flower growing in the midst of a massive desert. You also see that Victoria is a `ask no questions and do your job' personality. As the film progresses, this difference between the two characters becomes more and more evident. I don't want to spoil anything about the remainder of the movie's plot, so I'll leave it there.<br /><br />The special effects in this movie are some of the best that I've ever seen, and the flight sequences of the `bubble ship' that cruise uses to go out to repair the drones, are awesome. I really enjoyed the behind the scenes footage that is included. The version that I purchased included the DVD, Blu-Ray, digital copy, and Vudu streamed version of the film, so having the proper player was no issue at all.

B008PPQ2VS|5.0|I am obssessed with this product, and simply cant wait for my baby to come and play in it, it seems very durable and well worth the cost, I think it requires batteries, I didn't see it anywhere on the box, but when I try to play the music it doesnt play so I assume it does, I haven't set it up yet just waiting for my LO to come here!
B00D2HTRVQ|1.0|My daughter loves all the Dr. Panda games.  This one lended much less creativity and it was just plain boring to her.  She deleted it within 10 min of installing. It would be okay for a younger child.  She does love the automotive shop game and the hospital, restaurant, beauty salon etc.  This has been the only Dr. Panda game she did not love.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Not all aspects of this novel were believable for me and I wish the characters had been fleshed out more.

B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Awesome job Quentin T. Any movie he makes is awesome, Django was another Classic for sure. Definitely recommend it. Lots of Gore, Use of the N- word (too much actually), but story was great and film quality excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I finally got to play after the slow downloading. There's nothing wrong with my internet connection, it's just this games that has slow downloading.<br />It's a fun games but I don't like the in apps purchase.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This movie was recommended to us from another couple who enjoy good wine.  Thoroughly enjoyable and light.with comedy on the side.

B006TF6WAM|4.0|I didn,t know what to expect but found myself really enjoying Harold,s journey.  A thought provoking book and interesting all the way through.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Not only is the idea of the ghost creepy, but the idea of a parent gone insane because of one's spouse and ready to harm innocents is equally creepy. I like Guillermo Del Toro's films, and although not the best one, it is still good viewing.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I found this story ,together with the characters really interesting.  Was disappointed when the book was finished.  Really liked the ending.  Highly recommend.

B008LC8TJI|3.0|The irony of titling their new album \\"Overexposed\\" must have been lost on Adam Levine and Maroon 5. The album is overproduced, over-compressed and over-just-about-everything. Like so many bands in the current pop zeitgeist, they decided that they needed to conform to current popular production memes, which means having a guest rapper-of-the-moment (Wiz Khalifa, adding bonus profanities to \\"Payphone\\"), auto-tune, writer/producers of the now (Max Martin, Ryan Tedder) and multiple other steps that rob the band of any of their previous individual qualities. Take Adam out of the equation, and this would be another generic, over-compressed/produced pop-album.<br /><br />The saving grace is Adam, who's white-boy soul is on a par with Daryl Hall at this point. Given the material he has to work with, he milks every hook and croon he can. Good numbers like \\"Lucky Strike,\\" \\"Lady Killer\\" and even the obscenity laced \\"Payphone\\" stick like rubber cement. I'll make a quick point to say that I'm not a prude, but for a band that seemingly prides itself on their pop craftsmanship, the swearing in \\"Payphone\\" and \\"Tickets\\" just seems more gratuitous than effective, like the band has to prove how hard they are. But when you're capable of making really good light funk that hits its groove like \\"Fortune Teller\\" and \\"Doin' Dirt,\\" you don't need to prove you're anything but a great pop band.<br /><br />Which is what, ultimately, Maroon 5 is. \\"Overexposed\\" hits all its marks seemingly without effort, with craftsmanship that most any other band would sell their bubblegum machines for. Adam's unique voice gives the band enough identity to cut through the generic sounding production here, and when they horn-pump Prince's slinky \\"Kiss\\" (a bonus track on the deluxe version), they demonstrate that they're above the cookie-cutter sound that plagues this album.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Sure wish there were more levels. The game is great.  I like the way it make you think without giving you a headache.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing. I recommend this app to everyone who plays or is interested in Minecraft. It&quot;s worth your money. The blocks you use are extremely creative. Even if you are playing on the pc, xbox, or tablet this game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Just about the time I'm thinking that there can't possibly anything new, plot-wise, to write about, the creators come up with yet another off-the-wall scheme.  My deep regret is that the 8th season is supposed to be the last.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I got this initially because I thought with the 3 months free Netflix promotion it would cost me next to nothing.  Unfortunately they decided to rescind that promotion so I was 7 hours shy of qualifying for that.  Still it is a neat gadget I hope to have work for me in the future more than I can actually use it right now.<br /><br />Currently I have Blu Ray players on all my TV's which have WiFi connections with a ton of apps.  Those all work seamlessly and without any delays or buffering.  I am hoping that with the increased apps and support that the Chromecast will become more useful for me.<br />At $35 it has a lot of future potential.<br /><br />It was very easy to set up my Chromecast.  It was up and running in just a few minutes and I have tried out everything from Netflix to all the content I happened to have on the various tabs of my computer.  When playing a YouTube video at 720P it did have some issues keeping up, it was not entirely smooth as if I were watching it directly on my computer or through one of my WiFi capable Panasonic Blu Ray players.<br /><br />I am trying to find a dvd player that will work within a browser so that I can stream a DVD or BluRay from my laptop to a TV using Chromecast.  If I am able to find a way to do this it would become immediately much more valuable to me.<br /><br />Since you need to power the Chomecast via a USB power source and my TV does not have a USB port I have used the A/C adapter but have also successfully used a 12,000Mah battery I bought new from Ebay for 10.33 which is designed to charge smart phones and tablets.  I am waiting to see how long the capacity is for using it with Chromecast.  I have not had the time to measure that yet but am happy that I have this alternative way to power up the device.<br /><br />I had been hoping to use this with TV's in hotels but apparently that does not work.  There is an article on Cnet discussion this issue.  I doubt many hotels will want to let go of their very overpriced movies they offer but right now there are issues with using a hotel's WiFi with Chromecast.  Hopefully this will be resolved in the future to make it possible for this use.<br /><br />So Chromecast is a good idea, a neat device and has lots of potential.  It is new and very limited in it's apps which I think is going to expand for sure.  As for some of it's other limitations it is a wait and see situation.  I use many Google features from the Chrome browser to storing my music on Google play for free to using free Google Maps as a navigator on my smart phone.  Those all work exceptionally well and have remained free for a long time which is great.  Hopefully Chromecast will become as useful to me as those applications.<br />The best part is that I only have that $35 at risk.movies they offer but right now there are issues with using a hotel's WiFi with Chromecast.

Was glad they were spared from a step-mother who would have been nice to the children.  Hated it when she broke the baby's rattle her mother had given her.

I've read other authors' books on Elizabeth Woodville, her daughter, and other players in this saga (Sandra Worth, Alison Weir), and each one tells it a bit differently. In this version, I was turned off by the way that Henry raped Elizabeth to prove she was fertile before marrying her - it was the first time I had seen that perspective. I did enjoy the portrayal of Elizabeth Woodville - calculating, dedicated, and fiercely loyal to the men in in her life, even at the cost of her daughter's reign.<br /><br />That being said, I was actually somewhat frustrated and disappointed by how dimwitted she made Elizabeth of York out to be - and driving that point home with Henry's outbursts at her that despite her education, she was stupid and knew nothing. It's one thing for her to be in the dark about what was going on with the rebellions and to say \\"I don't know,\\" but that common refrain and the consistency of her questions to Henry: \\"Who?\\" I whispered, \\"What do you mean?\\" and repeating things that he says, makes her sound like a 10-year-old girl instead of a grown woman.<br /><br />It was also the first time I'd really read such a comprehensive story about Perkin Warbeck, and definitely the first time I'd heard of a perspective of him joining the court, and Henry falling in love with his wife Katherine. I enjoyed the little teasers about the future: like how the curse upon the killer of the Princes in the Tower would of course lead to the deaths of Arthur and then Henry VIII's son Edward, and in turn, a redheaded Elizabeth would become a virgin queen to end the Tudor dynasty.<br /><br />Overall, I still enjoyed the book, but as always, it leaves me with more questions about the Princes in the Tower, the true nature of Elizabeth's relationship with her uncle, and so-called lover, Richard III, and of course, Henry and Elizabeth's relationship as husband and wife. I'm excited to see Gregory's upcoming novel about Margaret Pole, Elizabeth's cousin and friend, who becomes the confidante of Katherine of Aragon, and is later executed by Henry VIII.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I downloaded it for free and read it pretty quickly over just a few hours. Most of the elements from the movie are here, p opp us a few I had never heard of.
B00CTNUMPO|5.0|I loved this movie in the past and Disney has done a great job bringing this movie back in great high definition on this new Blu-ray. I have always been a fan of the Oliver Twist story so Disney did a great job turning that story into a great new one with character that you will simply adore and some great actors/singers behind the voices as well.<br /><br />You get to see the underbelly of New York and go along on a great adventure too. My daughter had not seen this before so they really enjoyed it. I think they also enjoyed it because I was able to tell them that they were hearing some singers that we have helped them get to know as well.<br /><br />All-in-all this was a great new release and whether you have seen it before or not, I encourage you to pick up this new blu-ray today - you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />*I received a copy of this for review - all opinions are my own*
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book is so fun to read!  I've read The Secret, The Power, and now The Magic!  These are truly wonderful and fun books to read.  They help you see and change your thoughts to get what you want. The trick is to train yourself to stay in the positive, be grateful and good things will be drawn in like a magnet.  Just remember... you draw in what your thoughts put out.  Happy reading to those who want to change things in their life!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is the kind of popcorn movie that gives popcorn movies a good name. Action packed and humorous, the interactions between the characters was the best part. Mark Ruffalo was the best Bruce Banner, ever! And Scarlett Johanson is certainly easy on the eyes. Watch it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun to pass the time by but I finished all 10 levels in less then a day. It definitely needs more levels!
1608871819|4.0|Gorgeous artwork, and I've never had too much of a vested interest in Krypton until I saw the film and seen the artwork in this book. Glad to have it.
B007N5YJWK|3.0|A classic movie by criterion and good movie by Alfred Hitchcock's. but too bad not very good transfer picture in black and white with LPCM mono audio but with excellent special feature. if you have dvd version maybe you didn't have to upgrade to bluray version
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|not so pleased with end of some of my favorite charaters, but once again you have kept me on the edge of my seat watching in a marathon BBC!
B0034G4P8A|3.0|i didn't like this story but i liked THOR, Great Blu-ray with high definiton picture and a great audio DTS HD 7.1 and poor feature. if you fans of THOR maybe you could have this edition. if you freak movie mayabe you could rent or skip this edition
B00B1MHXY2|4.0|A very enjoyable recording. Fun to listen to and sing along with. They don't make records like this anymore. A must have.
B005LAIIGC|4.0|my kids and me like this movie. A great family movie. WIth a great transfer with aspec ratio 1.78:1 makes your LED so big and a great audio Dolby True HD 7.1 and average special feature. if you likes family movie take this edition with limited edition easter egg
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|The movie was fast paced and very entertaining.  The music and dancing  were fun and delightful.  It was also insightful to Katie Perry's life, her motivations, her kind personality, and humble beginnings in the music industry.  Loved her cantankerous grandmother;  she is very real.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|winning oscar and a controversial movie with tranfer picture very excellent and with audio DTS master Audio 5.1 makes film so live and very good documentary in special feature. you must own it
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|I didn't find anything original about this movie. I wanted to see it before going for the Despicable Me 2..............I don't know what's all the fuzz about that second movie, but the first one sucks. There are much better movies in this category - Toy Story, Incredibles, etc.<br />This one is a movie about really nothing, boring and really stupid
B005IZLPMY|4.0|superhero Captain America is classic for me when i am just as a kids. i liked this movie with a great transfer picture with aspek ratio 2.35:1 and  a great audio tranfer DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1<br />and a short feature<br />Marvel One-Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer<br />Outfitting a Hero<br />Howling Commandos<br />Heightened Technology<br />The Transformation<br />Behind the Skull<br />Captain America's Origin<br />The Assembly Begins<br />Deleted Scenes<br />Trailers
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book so much. I had to read this book for school and I got done with it in two days! I loved it so much!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Excellent story. A bit long and drawn out at the end. Also requires a leap of imagination to visualize a &#34;little Nazi Germany&#34; hidden in the jungles of South America. However, Pendergast is at his somber, silent withdrawn best. A good read!
1616551607|5.0|I'm going to make this short...<br /><br />I did not expect THIS MUCH for such a price. I've bought nearly 50+ artbooks (a majority of which I bought from Japan) and this is THE MOST I HAVE EVER GOTTEN FOR MY MONEY. Bang for your buck? Here it is. Amazing, intricate and mystical! The artwork of Amano-sensei.<br /><br />The paper is of very good quality. Nice and thick with a glossy texture. The binding is near-perfect. The perfs where the book is bound (white lines between the pages) is slightly visible, but stretch enough and not too much to the point where you can view 2-page artworks almost perfectly without it being a hindrance!<br /><br />The slipcase... I did not expect it to be very hardbound WITH SILKY FABRIC WOVEN ON TOP WITH ART FEATURED ON IT!! The 3 books themselves are STURDY hardcovers unlike hardcovers that feel like they're made out of cheap cardboard that are sure to last along with the beautiful slipcase.<br /><br />This slipcase set comes shipped with literally 2 boxes. The shipping package (in this case, Amazon's) and a well fitted cardboard box that keeps the set very, very well protected! No issues with damages at all if bought new!<br /><br />This was an amazing buy. If you are the slightest bit interested. GET IT. So much content, astonishing presentation, extreme satisfaction. That's all I can say. Happy shopping!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|My son said tell'em we tried but it just want play. The game will not load. It shuts my phone off. I have tried to uninstall and re-install. no luck
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I had purchased a leather case for my boy friend as a birthday gift at a much higher cost and believe me the Marware case I purchased through Amazon is so much better.  He even wants to purchase one like mine.  It is great.
B000U6DU92|2.0|I read all the great reviews so I tried it. I had to force myself to get half way through the first episode before turning it off. Maybe it gets better later on but this sure isn't my type of entertainment.
B008I43DYU|4.0|It's a normal calculator app. It does have some buttons that I am not familiar with. Probably a good calculator for an architect or someone that works with numbers.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This isn't groundbreaking and it is highly problematic at points. But we have to start having these discussions and this is a good starting point. Think critically and read it as a step into the issue.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This app is alright as far as letting me know what the weather is supposed to be. Sometimes it's accurate but here in Vegas the weather is weird, when it says it's supposed to rain it doesn't. Bright and sunny outside. So it's an alright app I would have to say.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Got this for my daughter. she really likes it! graphics are excellent and the horses move very realistically. would recommend for any child that love horses.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I chose this app because I play magic the gathering the trading card game and this app plays just like the magic the gathering game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is fun and challenging the codes can get complicated once you get into the higher levels though love it
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This app is pretty cool. Lots of things you can do to jazz up a picture of your kids, friends, outings or any special occasion.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|The Acting Performances are excellent of course, but David Russell should have won the Oscar for Best Director. I went to College in the Philly area, and have been to Upper Darby (Where the Jogging Scenes where Filmed), and Eagles Games and Tailgates. Russell could have filmed this in Toronto to save money, like most of the bottom liners in Hollywood, but he gave us the real deal. The Garbage Bag Sweat Suit by Cooper is so Philly, that I laughed out loud in the multiplex. DeNiro did his best work since \\"Goodfellas\\", Cooper went to a new level. Pat had so many obstacles, but his trying to stay positive was heart warming.<br /><br />  Two aspects of this film , make this the best of the decade so far. A flawless musical score by Danny Elfman, merged with various artists like the Alabama Shakes, Dave Brubeck etc.. And as we saw with Ms. Lawrence in the \\"Hunger Games\\" dead on facial expressions that show the vulnerabilities of Tiffany without even a spoken word. Amazing how a 21 year old actress could deliver such a performance. The bonus scenes with the alternate ending is terrific also.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I'VE PLAYED the original ganstar rio and are doing pretty good in than game but thisnlooks way cool and if you havent get rio then this  very cool
B00CW665VI|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Especially the man's point of view. I loved the simplicity of how his mind worked! Like most men it was a one tracked mine that only thought of one thing......bow chicka wow wow...! The heroine was fantastic I loved her she is everything a woman is....strong, intelligent, confident, vulnerable, risk taker, and a multitasker. Highly recommend! Emma just became my favorite new author!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Once I got started in the story, I couldn't put it down. I had the book finished within a few hours. I will definitely look for more books by this author.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. its good for all ages and any one who wants to play. I would recomened it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|The description of this app had me interested enough to download. Within seconds I was addicted and couldn't put it down.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have really enjoyed pinterest until just today when it automatically updated and now it is horrible!! It is hard to tap on things and repin them.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A lesson in life. It is interesting how many treasures in our backyards are sought in foreign lands, yet seldom found.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|hi<br />series two takes over where series one hangs!!!!<br />the second series is I think even better than the first. Mike and harvey make a great team. can't wait for series three on pRime
B009R5GR1K|3.0|Needs online ability unless you want to download whole book. Fair definitions; Thesaurus not great at all. Very basic for quick word look ups. Worth the price. However, don't expect anything tremendous. You get what you pay for!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Works with win 7, 8, linux, runs quicker than any other console USB-Serial.  The chip-set is very good.  Wound up ordering a dozen oif these from manufacturer for our field personnel.
1573225517|5.0|Better than the film which was spawn from it, and that is saying something! It portrays quite well the lifestyle and the angst of that generation, and does a wonderful job telling the story of one guy navigating his way through relationships, job satisfaction e ambition or lack of it. Highly recommended.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I am a Johnny  Cash fan and I think Joaquin and Reese played very good parts. Loved the music too.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Piper carries composure and wit through her experience.  Her story was well written, entertaining and educational.  I enjoyed reading this book.
1452110581|5.0|Shared this with a cat loving friend. We both enjoyed it sooooo much. It's in an honored place on my coffee table.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|One of the most entertaining movies out if a long time. The scenery is beautiful. I find myself watching it again just to see what I missed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love taking care of the horses. You get to enter competitions, feed it and more.<br />No in-app purchasing.<br />You get to buy lots of different horses too.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I have always loved this book.  It holds up well through time.  I still enjoy the scattered time line that somehow makes sense.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is to learn how to take responsibly of taking care of an animal. And it also give u responsibly on other things like,<br />1. Yourself<br />2. Other animals<br />3. And like babysitting<br />  And big jobs like that...;)
B001GJOL22|5.0|Of course, even if you're not a HUGE RUSH fan you'll love this from a few years ago - great audio and video quality.  Many extras and just overall a great tour.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like temple run except it has minions. My new favorite game only think is there is in app purchasing
B000O8OTNC|5.0|love this been working on a part of a sword sat was to thick and really didn't have the grinder, but I bought this little guy and wilted away at it for about an hour a day maybe 2 hours till it was razor sharp.<br />I Have sense got a grinder and such thing get done in minutes, but still this little guy works if you have no electricity
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It not only help me be consumed but also has an urgency to make u wanna keep playing n keep goin till you cant no more
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|reminded me of norman bates . stupid un funny . dont waste your money . why cant people make a decent scary movie anymore
B008B1BL4E|5.0|The book is an exceptional account of the events leading to the catastrophic onset of World War I.  The history is generally not familiar to Americans.  A terrorist plot in Sarajevo precipitates a world war.  Great Britain, France, and Russia entered the war although they had not been attacked, nor had they been threatened with attack.  The statesmen (Sleepwalkers) of the era are brought to life in wonderful detail.  Again, the individuals and the events are not familiar to Americans.  The book has been researched in exquisite detail; the material is organized and presented wonderfully.  Christopher Clark provides his interpretations of the events and documents which preceeded and led to the war.  Events which may pique the interest of prospective readers are:  The regicide in Serbia, 1903.  The Italian invasion of Libya, 1911.  The Balkan Wars, 1912-1913.  The involvement of the Great Powers in Morocco.  The annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The Serbian terrorist societies.  The details relating to the assassination of the Archduke.<br /><br />The book is an exceptionally well researched exposition of government ineptidude, mismanagement, dishonesty, and betrayal which permitted a despicable terrorist plot to precipitate 4 years of war and enormous individual suffering and loss.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very touching story that teaches us a lot, very personal. This I recommend to people that have difficulty believing that God is watching over us and that we only have to have love to share.
B00000427L|5.0|I have had this set on my shelves for a long time -- long before Amazon was even a twinkle in Jeff Bezos's eye -- and thought highly of it, but when I started reviewing I started listening to other recordings: Thibaudet, Graffman, Hough, Argerich, Ashkenazy's earlier recordings.  Many of these are fine -- and I look forward to hearing Andsnes -- but I went back to this one to see how it held up.  Well, it held up pretty darn well.  Although the piano is slightly forward in the aural picture, the orchestra is given plenty of presence, and Previn (a very fine conductor of big romantic pieces) is simply superb in assuring the tonal and rhythmic adjustments needed if these concertos are going to breathe as they should.  One example: the intensification of expression following the little cadenza-like moment as the second movement of the Second concerto drives to its climax -- it just doesn't get any better.  Comparing these performances (from around 1970) with Ashkenazy's fine recordings of the Second and Third from the early 1960's, it strikes me that the balance is better here and Previn's conducting at least as cohesive (though I love that Second with Kondrashin!).  And further listening has heightened my appreciation of the music -- the variety and delicacy of these pieces can be overlooked when the big tunes start swinging out.  Ashkenazy, one of the great pianists of the last sixty years, is fully in command, and the Decca engineers do justice to the power and the sweetness of his tone.  All in all, a marvelous bargain.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Look dude<br />I think this game is an awesome game for people around the world.<br />Boys ,girls ,men ,women like this game
B00CM9JKXU|5.0|If one thing has remained constant and true of Queensryche it is their ability to change and keep moving forward with faith in themselves and their fans. And change they did by dismissing one of the greatest and influential rock voices to ever sing. How could QR possibly continue without that voice? Find a new incredible voice on par with the progressive power of the mighty 'Ryche, which they did with Todd LaTorre. Holy smokes does he have vocal strength and range!!<br />The songs on this 2013 album are reminiscent of their early work from their EP to Empire. Thought provoking lyrics that is typical with Queensryche, epic songs, and some flat-out rockers grace this short album. The more I listen to this CD, the more I love it! Their return to the top of the rock world is on its way because Queensryche is back in fighting shape and kicking butt on this record.
B0012CH350|4.0|This fits our grill perfectly and is of better quality than the last one we had.  Time will tell if it can hold up to the heat here in Hawaii.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Its a fun game. but i worked so hard to get peanuts but then they all disappeared. so now i have to start over again
B00DY76Z32|1.0|This film is a real dud.  Waste of Jeff Bridges and kevin Bacon in this one!  They must have needed the cash because it is a mixed up mess.  Does not make sense-stupid comedy and a waste of talent.  Bridges is a great actor and does not need to be in stuff like this.  He is an oscar winner and Bacon is close! They should be making movies that make the most of their talents but this one sure doesn't.  I almost walked out half way thru. Go see Crazy Heart and any movie Bacon is in to enjoy film making. Stupid stupid comedy!
0920668372|5.0|Such a sweet book , my son loves it and reads it himself. Makes me cry everytime I read it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good puzzle game.<br />Graphics could be better but an overal fun game. My sons and i have enjoyed solving these together.
B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|I did read this book back around 1993, when I was in elementary school. That book was extremely difficult for me at that time, however, I was in a village with a plenty of free time.<br />I think that is one of the best programming books written ever! I can recommend this book to anyone who wants to become a top software engineer as must read!
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Love, love, love this movie! Heartwarming, funny and it's a true story! You won't be disappointed, even though you have to read the lines.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|i got this because its on dvd and i don't have to keep a vcr to watch it. the quality is pretty good as well
B009EBLCK8|5.0|The way the characters are portrayed as well as specific episodes are as unexpected as the season finale. Definitely something to watch.
145210655X|4.0|When my husband bought this for my 5 year old son, I thought it would be mostly over his head since he is not yet familiar with the movie/characters.  But he absolutely loves it!  In fact, he liked it so much that we later purchased &#34;Vader's Little Princess&#34; for our daughter!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Not really sure what all the hype is about.  Actually decided against seeing the movie after attempting to read this book.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Star Wars the Complete Saga was a birthday gift and it was amazing! I had had the newer trilogies but only on DVD and never Blu-Ray and I had never had the original trilogy at all. I will split my review into three tiny sections of my thoughts on the Complete Saga.<br /><br />The Box: The casing that the Blu-Rays are housed in is very strong and durable. The case is decorated with some nice artwork and the Blu-Rays slide out easily. Nothing else to say about that.<br /><br />The Prequel Trilogy: Remastered into Blu-Ray the video and audio quality is amazing! It is how Star Wars was meant to be viewed and heard. No qualms about these movies.<br /><br />The Original Trilogy: I understand that George made changes to the original films via CGI, new scenes, etc. Most of the changes I did not mind, however there is one change that really really bothered me. In episode VI when the rebels have finally prevailed a new scene is shown. This scene shows people celebrating all over the empire from various planets of the Star Wars universe. My only problems is it is all CGI and done very poorly. There is even a part where citizens tear down a statue of the Emperor. I could not believe they would add something like this. It was completely unnecessary and took away from the original experience of the film.<br /><br />Bottom line I love my Blu-Ray saga and would recommend it to anybody.
B0036FYO12|5.0|Great spy movie. Nice to see a movie that relies on acting and not explosions and chase scenes all throughout the movie.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I always enjoy Dan's books excellent writer. Not sure what you want me to say I read it, enjoyed it, and would read anything he writes.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoy it every day for a few minutes.  Fun, hard to do but not that hard.  For for small ones to use old guys and gals.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a companion volume and you do need the other one which is all about the technicality of getting it on the Web. However this short guide deals with the writing process, explaining which programs to use (Word is favoured, and I recommend the newest version you can get) and not to use tabs or two returns but to use other ways of formatting your paragraphs, available in Word and with illustrations from the latest version of Word.  This means that the book will appear properly on Kindle and on phones, IPads and other platforms.<br />There is a lot of this data already on the publishing pages on line so the books are not obligatory but if you read them you have a better chance of getting it right.<br /><br />If like me you are sick and tired of waiting for publishers to even return your manuscript in stamped addressed envelopes if they don't want it, or weary of waiting for a reply to your e-mailed enquiry, then take matters into your own hands. Become a more professional publisher than the publishers. There are a lot of sites out there trying to charge you for all kinds of services so you can spend thousands before your book ever hits the net or the printed page. Don't use any of them. Friends will help proofread if you need it, check all data, even items you are sure of, take good photos for the cover or use an image from the selection available on Kindle. You don't need an agent, or a publisher, who mainly take your money and tell you to do the publicity. Publishing houses are great for well-established authors who want to get into every bookshop but they are very, very bad at giving new talent a chance.<br />You don't need their permission. Read this book and see how simple it is.  Go do it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Quick and easy to use best alarm ever. You should get this app if you need a quick and easy wake up system
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Not real happy with it.  Not too good Not too bad either...just so-so.  There are better games out there.  Just ok.
B0046B3QTG|1.0|i enjoy animated films that have an underlying adult humor. This film only had one funny adult moment (the bank of evil, lehman brothers). The minions were dumb and irritating. The Minion is Megamind is FAR superior. Couldn't watch to the end.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Seems like the story of my kindle life!!!!  I am SO sick of getting these apps...even for free & they DON'T work...I have tried support & still nothing can get them working...I am about to GIVE up!!!

B009K916ZK|5.0|Honestly, I've bought so many different brands of these things, and I get the same result. After a while, the third-party adapter just start failing, but with the Apple brand, it lasts the longest.<br /><br />Trust me on this, buy the official adapter. It may cost more, but it will save you the hassle of buying another other adapters after the cheaper ones break.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|I actually hadn't kept up with Papa Roach much after the release of &#34;Last Resort&#34; (years and years ago now). However, I saw this album somewhere and decided to check it out out of curiosity. I ended up loving it, so I bought it. I have to say I'm surprised by how much I ended up playing this album...it is rare that I can listen to an entire album on loop without wanting to skip tracks that I dislike. There AREN'T any tracks that I dislike, so this was totally worth the money for me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app!! other than it crashes sometimes its great!!! but all I can ask is that the updates come put faster!!! please!!!
B009IQ0TGM|3.0|Even though other people might really end up liking Halcyon, I have to admit that I didn't end up liking it nearly as much as I had anticipated (so much for previewing it ahead of time). I suppose I had expected Halcyon to have more tracks that were similar to Lights (which I have loved from the first time I heard it), but I found some of the songs to be rather odd and not really my style. So although it isn't the worst collection of songs I own, it certainly isn't the best.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A great man once said, regarding art, \\" The work must never show, All great art appears effortless, this applies to visual and performance art.\\" Red is a perfect example, the mastery of the art of acting in this film is sublime! What fun to witness the great performances by each and every member of this STAR cast. However they had a little help, with equally masterful direction, writing, cinematography,special effects and I think all the way to the catering. Every aspect of this film looks like it was as much fun for them as it is for us. I rent movies first to see if they are films I will want to watch often, well Red is on my buy list now! So save the renal and buy Red, you will be watching it ...often.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was surprised to see that either a lot of cultural knowledge or exhaustive research went into this book. Its characters, although brief in appearance, are very well thought out. It has a very human narrative and perspective. I have not seen the movie, but I am betting that it is not as good as the book. I highly recommend it for those looking for zed literature that is out of the simple norms.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Good classic book for readers of all ages.  I would recommend this book for anyone with an interest in classic adventure stories.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|The book is particularly recommended to introverts to understand one's nature and be happy in life. Though it seems unnecessary lengthy for me.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this app is great,  it has most of the minecraft features, BUT...there is a lot of stuff missing from the actual com. version. examples would be,  certain mobs are missing, you cant use redstone, and you cant change your skin. (so your STEVE all the time. over all great app and as sky the kid would say : BUDDER!!!!!! (I hats squids)

B005PR2FD8|4.0|100x better then the live action film the preceded it but not all characters from the games history is shown. Showing that fillers don't need to be made just to get screen time for specific characters, this has a great story and execution for the film.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|its good game but low on peanuts all the time just doing this to see if I get peanuts lol but its I good game not just saying that for peanuts. lol
B0087YYHZU|5.0|The only thing better then this is the huge collector's edition that even includes an umbrella. Any musical and Gene Kelly fan needs to own this.
1616551607|5.0|If you are a fan of Final Fantasy, you need to get this amazing collection of art works from a multitude of the games in the series. The outside of the box is very high quality stuff and each book contains very high quality pages of different characters and monsters from the game. For the price it is right now there should be no second thought. Great price and great piece to own for any fan of Final Fantasy.
B00BPJ5Z96|4.0|The audio quality could have been brought out better and the overall screen ratio has been cropped from the previous Blu Ray version but is slightly unnoticeable at times.
B00C6Q3UNK|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who has children that likes monster high. I bought this for my granddaughter and she plays with it everyday.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My daughter has several of these type of games, where you can apply makeup, etc.  There are only a few color options available for free, so that limits the game, and it's not one to hold her attention for very long, but she enjoys it.
1401307450|5.0|I'm an avid book reader and will typically devour any pages put in front of me in a matter of days, Scar Tissue was no exception. I had (more) recently read Dave Navarro's \\"Don't Try This at Home\\" and while I loved this book - it just wasn't long enough. So after a short mourning period (which I always experience after reading) I decided to give this one a shot. I've been a RHCP fan since the birth of Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik - back when I was 13 years old and alternative music was just beginning to hit the radios in Ohio. This book, was incredible! Anthony tells a tale of his at times horrific and heartbreaking, yet ever so fascinating life. I could tear myself away. Anthony proves to be everything I never expected him to be, which is an honest, well spoken (and written), sensitive, and caring individual. He by no means portrays himself as being \\"better than\\", as some celebrities tend to do. I hope that in the future there will be another book that he will write, catching us (the reader and fans) up to speed w/ where he is today. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is a fan, or just fascinated in how different we all are in the world.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I'm struggling to think of what to Say that will adequately explain how I felt about this. I didn't love it as much as the first but I still couldn't put it down. I was frustrated with America's back and forth the whole book between Aspen and Maxon. I just wanted her to get her shit together already. But I am curious, and still want to read the last book even though I was disappointed with how this turned out because I expected more. Overall it was well written and any one who enjoys YA will like.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Its fun to have to wait to see what dragons you got and I like how the game didn't force you to buy gems. Its also very relaxing although my brother is addicted with it. I love seeing what you can get at New levels. It is also fun to see all the unique dragons. I LOVE DRAGONVALE
B008478VE8|4.0|It is a seminal book on one of the most significant theories guiding the study of life. Darwin, together with Wallace, were ahead of their time and realized early on that life is a complex system of trial and error.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a pretty long time it was a emotionally touching movie and won't regret getting the movie
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Good story, talented cast, lots of action and fun. No language or sex. I wish all movies were like Red.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game EVER since the best thing EVER I guess get it and trust me you will not regret it it is FUN :)
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I got this app because I wanted to download videos off YouTube since you can't on the kindle fire hd. The longer the video, the longer it takes to download. When I downloaded a video, I had to keep my device running and keep resuming it when it stopped. And when it is done I play and it says &quot; sorry this video can't be played. I got one video to play and it was about five minutes long. I like this app a lot and I really wish it worked. Try it, it's FREE. Hope it works for you. I recommend Music Unlimited for anyone that wants music videos. Now I'm going to try AVD Android Video Downloader. You can stream videos from dailymotion which is similar to YouTube. Sounds good to me. :D
B00992CF6W|3.0|NEEDS MUILTIPLAYER. I love Minecraft on anything but i cant play with friends. My best friend isnt sure about Minecraft and she will only play if i play and my other friends need help on Minecraft. We also need More maps that come with the game plus why cant we switch from survival and creative and the other way around please make changes and upgrade put servers and more mods Mojang
B003G4W49C|5.0|A quick thrilling read that i think all ages would enjoy. Wonderful. Can't wait to read more by the author
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Fast paced and completely engrossing.  It reminded me of Lady in the Water or something other worldly written by Clive Barker.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I would recommend readers start with Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (book one of the first series.)<br />Through Percy Jackson and the Olympians: book 5, the Last Olympian, and starting the second series with The Lost Hero.<br />Rick Riordan is a creative and talented writer.<br /><br />GO!<br />READ THE BOOKS FROM THE BEGINNING AND ENJOY THIS EPIC SERIES OF ADVENTURES!<br />This is seriously a great twist on classic Greek and Roman Mythology.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I'm only halfway through this book but love going back to it and following the story and characters, all of which/whom are well-developed.  It's a good, long read, too - all the more to savor!  I'm already looking forward to the next Century Trilogy book!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. I love the action and excitement. It feels like the game will never end. This is one of my favorite games ever.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|I kept hearing people talking about \\"Kiss\\" and \\"Call Me Maybe\\" and thought, what's it all about?  So, curiosity made me buy the CD and, oddly enough, I think \\"Curiosity\\" is one of the two best songs on the CD.  While I like \\"Kiss\\" and \\"Call Me Maybe\\" they didn't make me want to sing along like everyone else apparently did.  But I have to crank up \\"Curiosity\\" when it comes on and I think that \\"More Than a Memory\\" is the best song on the album.  I like the way she sings, but I have to say that \\"More Than a Memory\\" has potential as a powerful song and with someone with a really powerful voice, it could be a show stopper.  And again, that's nothing against how Carly sings.  She has a beautiful voice.  So, what do I want you to know from this review?  It's a pop-and-dance sort of CD with some catchy songs.  If you like that kind of music, you'll probably like it.  If you don't, then skip it and check out a genre that you do like.
B00821OX98|5.0|I rented this movie from Amazon download and I had know trouble downloading the movie, and if I did Amazons customer service is excellent they will help you not like other companies. I think this was a excellent science fiction movie with a lot of action another most see season.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|for Android tablet, laptop and cell phone.  Love the app and the syncing from one device to the other so I'm always able to pick up where I left off no matter which device I'm using.  If you don't have a Kindle, consider downloading and installing the Kindle app so you can take advantage of book downloads!  It's great!
B008JFUR10|5.0|I've seen Pacific Rim twice now, just to make sure, and, yes, this movie is destined to be a classic in the sci-fi/action genre.  It's not perfect, but there is so much love, passion, exuberance and fun packed into every moment of the film, that any and all minor nitpicks are forgotten, in favor of the sheer joy of watching it.  This film is a love letter to Japanese monster cinema, but you don't have to be a fan of that genre to appreciate the spectacle that Del Toro presents here.  The CGI is stunning, each shot brilliantly composed.  The editing and flow is smooth and perfect, not jumpy and cutty.  Important moments and action is allowed to breathe.  Shots are as long as you want them to be-- long enough to fully absorb what you are seeing.  And there are terrific little moments of subtle and not so subtle comedy.  The performances are all solid and respectable, the story and dialog is crisp and tight and serves the overall purpose to establish this world-in-peril and get us into the action.  Some of my friends didn't like some of the sub-plots, especially, what seems like a pretty stereotypical conflict between two of the Jaeger pilots.  I agreed to an extent, but I think Del Toro is just trying to shoe-horn in a little character arc here and there, and the nasty pilot's resolve was stronger for having seen him at his worst.  There are a NUMBER of dumb little elements to nitpick:  How do a handful of helicopters carry the massive Jaegers?  How did this Jaeger technology come into being in so near a future?  To all of this I simply say that if you go into this film ready, willing and able to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride, you will be richly rewarded with an almost transcendent film experience.  Del Toro isn't promising anything other than a rocking, good time, and he DELIVERS exactly that-- in spades.  We've forgiven far worse transgressions of belief and plausibility in the many other films we've canonized as sci-fi classics: from planet-busting battle stations to head-melting golden boxes to an entire world powered by the body heat of enslaved humans.  Pacific Rim breaks the laws of reality in no worse way than these classics, and does it all with the same sense of fun and adventure.  Just an absolutely terrific film!
B004EWFUQY|4.0|I found the book chock full of decent information, and easy to understand.  However....  there are A LOT of specialty foods that I have never eaten, or purchased and don't plan to.  It's expensive enough when you're on a (different) juicing diet, and the Dukan Diet requires quite a bit of expensive meat and other products.  Because the recipes were a bit over my budget, I never followed through with this diet.  Sorry that I can't give it 5 stars based on my lack of desire.  I did, however, purchase the oat bran and will again in the future.
B00005QW4K|5.0|Now my set is complete... It's nice to se the movie Sam Rami wanted to make... The theatrical version was just as good.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I have recommended this to my friends and husband. It kept my attention because it had many moving parts. I really enjoyed it.
B00AB2DNBU|5.0|A must have... Still gives me chills... The remake is a modern update that gives us two of the best horror movies ever...
B00338QENI|5.0|I wish I could find more books like this. It was so interesting. I learned so much from the book
B009WUAK2M|3.0|If you listen to some of the shout outs to other roles of the actors , and other lines of the actors used in their movies its good for a laugh. I did enjoy it for that reason. As for plot  standard shot em up!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read this for my book club. I cried while reading it. I have recommended it to everyone I know.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Update 7/31/13: I received my promo code and was able test Netflix. It works well from the browser, my android phone, and Kindle Fire.  There is a slight delay with the controls from my phone, but it works well otherwise.  Hopefully they will add more apps or improve casting from the browser soon, like Amazon Instant Video or Hulu.<br /><br />--------<br />As a cord-cutter I was expecting to use this to stream video instead of connecting my laptop via HDMI.  Aside from the fact that I didn't get the free Netflix I was promised (yet), the device doesn't do what I expected.<br /><br />Video cast from the chrome browser is un-watchable.  It is jerky at best, and audio is out of sync.  Since I don't have that free Netflix subscription yet (it takes about 5 days to be emailed) I tried Hulu and a couple other sites with no luck.  This is a deal-breaker for me. Also, it requires a power cord not depicted in any of the marketing images, but that is minor.<br /><br />Here's what it CAN do:<br />- Using an Android phone it can stream video from Youtube, allowing you to select, play, pause video from the phone. I don't know about iOS devices<br />- it can stream from Netflix Android app (did not test this because I don't have that free subscription)<br />- it can stream from Google Play Android app (I'm not going to buy media from Google)<br />- You can \\"cast\\" your Chrome browser to the TV, but quality of video is an issue<br />- Youtube.com has a special cast button and streams rather well to the device from the Chrome browser
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I just loved this book. We read it in my book club. I found it relate able. Others did not.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|These connectors work like gangbusters, very well made and reliable. Being Apple products, they are expensive for what you get, but they really work well.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I gladly give this well written book a five star rating. Descriptive and emotional with well developed characters. A love story of the best kind. I plan to search out more works by Christina McKenna.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love this app. Me and my friend are basically obsessed with this app. Its so cool how you can play pop songs or rock songs, and I love how you can change the settings. This app makes me feel like I can really be a pianist. Haha there are no annoying ads all over the screen, and the graphics are great. If you're looking for a piano app, this is the one. Five stars.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I'm only here to get gems but I do enjoy the game. its cute. it makes me want.horse even though I know there's way more work involved.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Does not compare well with the Apple app. The Amazon app does not provide a way to logout. Apple recently updated their version to allow a logout.<br /><br />I do not like the idea of my email account being visible to anyone that picks up my Kindle fire, even if they have permission to use it, email contents are personal and private.<br /><br />The convenience of having an icon that I can click on to go to my yahoo mail account is outweighed by the lack of privacy for my account.<br /><br />I am going to delete this app and go through the drawn out approach of going through web.<br /><br />Would not recommend this app to anyone, if the app gets upgraded to allow for a logout so that it compares equally with the Apple app I have for my ipad and my iphone I may reconsider, but right now this app is junk!
B000FBJHZS|4.0|I like Dan Brown writing.. The story is fast coming to the point. A lot of resurge in the artic. I have read four books written by him and like them all. greeting Tamara
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Great movie for grandkids and adults alike. Funny and we always enjoy a good laugh. This is a great movie to watch.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|Great read.  All questions are answered....although it left me with a heavy heart.  Terrific job Kate Morton.  Can't wait it read the next one.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Having not read the book prior to seeing the movie, I found the film to be violent without a discernable story. After discussing the film with persons who had read the book I was then able to fill in some details. Overall, this was a mediocre film in my opinion.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I liked Fall of Giants so much, I didn't think that it was possible to be as good as Fall of Giants but it was.  Not only was the character development great, but the back ground on political ideologies was expertly woven into the story.  Of course in order to get all of this into novel content, made the plot a little too contrived sometimes, but it was still a masterful job of story telling.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Very good movie.  First streaming movie i've ever ordered, and i'm glad it went well.  Good movie, I'm even considering buying a copy for myself.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Watched this movie with my boys. It was an enjoyable super hero flick.  A must see movie with iron man, Thor,etc.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|This is an amazing read that has truly motivated me and changed my way of thinking. I recommend to anyone who wants better in life
B00DHNJCKQ|1.0|terrible movie all dark could see  anything. good plot just could not see stayed dark the whole movie. sorry not fun movie to watch.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This band is just as awesome in concert as listening to them at home, car or anywhere. great things  to come

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|The album is great glad I got the disc as well. Linkin Park get better and better even has a fort minor feel.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Really enjoyed this game while it lasted,played a few times a day for a month. All of a sudden, on day 30 I could no longer play, unless I accessed the game through my FACEBOOK ACCOUNT (which I do not believe in doing).  So... fun while it lasted, but extremely disappointed....no forewarning, no mention that this was a stipulation of playing the game,  only thought it was an option.<br />Sooooooo, unless you want to play through your FACEBOOK account don't bother.<br />Would like to add that actually I was given a choice either log on via FACEBOOK or start from scratch, losing all of my points, credits and levels. I have deleted this game from my Kindle device.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|had to have this song it was stuck in my head for weeks and now can make others suffer the same

B00C5ZORES|5.0|Fall out boy hit it out of the park songs are great and collaborate with good artists Saving rock & roll with Elton John is awesome and The Mighty Fall is my new Anthem
B002LC8HF0|4.0|A good finale to the series.  I love how little things froms throughout the books start to have major relevance.  Everything comes together and it doesn't feel forced.  Good job Mr Sanderson!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|id heard all the hype about this show. decided to watch it. i was pleasantly surprised since im not a zombie fan. its a little gruesome at times. not just blood and guts, but the zombies killed a horse in one of the first few episodes....eeekkk!!!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Initially it was not as interesting as I hoped but became riveting by the end. I mainly wanted to watch it because of the woman's mental health and to see how accurately it was portrayed (I am a mental health counselor) but I also became very interested in the man who had &#34;turned&#34;.  Looking forward to more episodes.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|What? when I go to [...] it says, iOS coming soon. Why wasn't this advertised? I am returning this. not worth.<br /><br />Update: iOS setup is currently unavailable. Other setup options are windows 7 leaptop, MAC laptop or android device.<br /><br />I have windows xp laptop. I tried setup on xp laptop and gave up after multiple failed setup attempts.<br /><br />Once the setup is done, I can use my iPhone/iPad to stream.<br /><br />I will need to borrow somebody's windows 7 laptom or android device to setup the chromecast.<br /><br />Lot of waste of time.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I just love Jethro Tull.I grew up listening to this music It is very good to hear this music again
0451169514|4.0|This was good but not his best book.This edition was harder to read than my old copy that got lost.I don't know why but it was harder for me to read it.Maybe the size of the book with the thickness of it.It should be wider I guess.Publishers need to take that into consideration when making thicker books.<br />I myself liked the Stand better than It. But if you can handle the size of this book in your hands to sit and read it-it is good.Hey----its Stepen King!!!!!
B00000AOUD|5.0|This is great music.If you like jethro tull youn will really love this cd.I love this cd so very much
1442444053|5.0|If you are a fan of Watership Down-you have to buy this edition! I had the mass paperback edition and this one makes you realize Wow! I missed something! The pictures are beautiful.The text is so much clearer and better. This book does better justice to the rabbits that have become special to me.Once you read the book-you will never look at a rabbit the same way ever again! Buy this! It is for adults that like a little variety in their reading,its for a parent that wants to give their child a better glimpse into the animal world-so its fiction......rabbits talk to each other some way,don't they?? For a granny that wants to sit down and read a story that will spark imagination and a love for animals and reading into their grandchild,etc..........I think this book should be in every house in every childs hands.I love love love Watership Down!!!!! Makes me look at my bunnies outside in a new light!!!! This edition is BEAUTIFUL!!! It almost feels like velvet in your hands. The beautiful pictures take your breath away.The details in them make you think you were right there with the rabbits.The side bar on this book has the rabbits on it as well.Well worth the price as this will be one you will keep forever! Better buy 2 though-because you will need one as a gift to a family member so your copy does not walk away! Stunning!! And I have never said that about a book before!!!!! GET it!!!!
B000BGR0OM|5.0|I love this cd.I bought this because I love hearing Annie lennox.She  is the greatest singer.Please buy this cd bye
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I enjoyed the makeover and the special effects were great. The 3D was done well ad made the movie worth watching.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This show is so entertaining! Really makes you believe Sherlock could exist today!<br />Never boring! I can't believe I am so late finding it!
B00B769XB8|5.0|I truly enjoy this movie and especially in 3D. I would definitely recommend this as a late night on the weekend  type of movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really easy and fun, good way to kill time plus the minions are really funny.overall a great game, graphics are killer. I like it a lot
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! It is a stress reliever and great brain trainer. Sometimes I can not put it down!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book offered a great ending to the series. It helped to tie up all the loose ends and let you learn even more about Christian and the self discovery if Anna. The only weird part of the book was the mystery &#34;who done it&#34; feel this book took on. It felt a little forced and not in line with the other 2 books. This is why the book only got 4 stars. Otherwise this was a good book and I was pleased with the ending. I also enjoyed the added portion of seeing some of the story through Christian's eyes.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|If the terms of service allowed for a little more privacy, I'd put everything in here. As such its great for things that I want to save from online and then take with me when I'm offline such as recipes and instructions. I don't use premium services not would I pay for them.
0802473156|5.0|This was a fabulous book.  It should be required reading for all young adults so as they start to develop relationships, they have the tools they will need to be successful in relationships.  My husband and I just read the book , are separated, and it has helped us move toward reconciliation.  Worth buying.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Great read, I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend it to others. I felt the words of the book.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|My wife and I both like this series very much.  Unfortunately, there seems to be little chance of it returning for another season.  I would like to be wrong, but I have seen no indication that it will be returning.<br />Bob Morton
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So curt and so much fun I want it on my phone defiantly will keep your kids occupied as well.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a good game except I wish there was a way to collect more gems and other items faster. If you're into hidden object games then I would recommend it.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is the movie that started the entire eat healthy trend! Don't skip over it! It's worth every minute of your time!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a super fun game that everyone can enjoy. Definitely worth the download!! I can't believe how much fun I'm having! It's so great how great this game is.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This film gives you an easy to understand and in depth look at the financial crisis of 2008. Matt Damon does a great job narrating and once you get past the first 10 minutes, you forget it's even him. It doesn't pick on any specific presidency, but instead gives you a good history behind everything leading up to the crisis. If you want to know how hard we've been screwed by the banks, and are interested in learning the facts behind the crisis, buy this movie and watch it. There's really no excuse to ignore it if you want to call yourself an informed and active citizen in our national discussion about the economy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome the new update is fun I miss the old one I hope a new Ron can come out I think you should do a new York one
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You will cry.<br />You will be shocked.<br />You will have closure.<br />To me, this is the perfect ending to Katniss.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Just simply amazing, great when you are alone and want to play magic. Can't wait to see what's next. I'll be keeping a close eye for even better things in the future.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|We saw them together years ago for a concert.  We saw them in Philadelphia when they were much younger, but very good.
B0072NWKEC|2.0|A Nazi murder mystery written in the purplest of prose; the author's use of outrageous metaphors was comical and clumsy.  The Nazis murder one of their own, and our hero is confronted with a bewildering array of evil Nazi suspects in an attempt to persuade the reader that the most illogical candidate did not commit the crime.  Then, voila, all is instantly solved by our hero-- and the murderer reaches a strange accommodation with his accuser-- and the Germans go on to lose the war.  The story development is weak, and all the characters, save our hero, are one-dimensional caricatures of evil.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|So far, I love this app.  I have an older HTC Inspire that does not have a lot of RAM or internal memory, so this app is perfect for killing unwanted processes and managing which apps are moved to the SD card.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a wonderful read. I bought it for a flight from the US to the UK. It made the flight a lot less painful and I enjoyed it for the next 2 weeks on vacation. The settings, the characters, the storyline all combined to produce a terrific read. I will be sure to buy the others in this series.
B00821OX98|5.0|My husband and I love the show. We binge watch because its so addictive. Can't believe the CG effect ts for television. The story line is well written and the character development is pretty good as well.<br />We want to watch the initial invasion, wondering if the creators have thought about creating that yet.
B00498XP1K|5.0|Being a fan of Charlie Brooker's other work (How Television Ruined Your Life in particular), when I saw this available on instant video I bought it. I also love horror and some zombie films, so it was a no brainer.<br /><br />I thought it was going to be silly. I was wrong. The first episode genuinely scared me. The atmosphere and actions of the characters make for a suspenseful show. The premise itself is also well done.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is the simplest way to connect my Android devices to my big screen TV. This takes my basic HDTV and makes it a Smart TV. There are lots of alternatives to this device for streaming YouTube and Netflix but this is the easiest that I have tried. This also allows me to play my Google music on my TV which no other device has allowed me to do.<br />Installation was simple: Plug it into a HDMI port, plug the power cable into a USB port, turn on the TV and follow the on screen instructions with your android device.<br />The quality of the video and sound were excellent on my wireless N network, with only slight buffering at the beginning.<br />I would highly recommend this device to anyone, especially anyone without a smartTV or other alternative already.<br />I look forward to more apps being used with this little device.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|when i got the update it reset. so i fell like delete the game but ill se if it fixes it self.
1451626096|4.0|I have to begin this review honestly by saying that I am a huge fan of the history of the English monarchy, and I have been obsessed with the War of the Roses era for about a year. Edward IV, Elizabeth Woodville, Anne Neville, and most especially Richard III. I consider Philippa Gregory to be among the very best authors of this genre. This volume in the Lancaster/York/Tudor saga is about the marriage of Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, and her marriage to Henry VII (Henry Tudor, who won the throne by killing Richard III in battle). I really loved this chapter in this era of the monarchy. My only issue with it (and the reason for subtracting a star)is that the author portrays Elizabeth York as the lover of her uncle, Richard III. Though some histories suggest this to be the case, I think it uncharacteristic of Richard. I am also a proponent of the growing belief that Henry VII was responsible for the murders of the princes in the Tower rather than Richard. Despite my quibbles, this novelization of this period in history is marvelous.
B000WCDI64|1.0|Amy was wasted when she started the concert and continued to drink throughout what I could stand to watch.  I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love these kind of gun apps they show how they had to go threw out there on the battle feild.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|How could an American identify with with 2 Afghani women?  Laila and Mariam are portrayed with such warmth that they became my friends as soon as I met them.  Despite the fact that Mariam is an outcast, an illegitimate daughter of a wealthy man and his epileptic housekeeper, while Laila is the cherished daughter of a middle-class, educated family, the two women share the dream of becoming educated and independent.  I longed for them to succeed -- to escape from their terrible marriages and the imprisoning laws imposed by the Taliban.  The one caveat that I have in recommending this book is \\"don't read it if you don't want to be depressed,\\" because you will care about Laila and Mariam, and the sadness in their life will make you sad too.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|For some reason, this game is highly addicting. I just can't get enough of it. The graphics can be a little bit men here and there, but overall, I like it.
B002WJI658|1.0|My son hated this product.  He said it looks ugly and cheap. The legs are ridiculous.  The plush looks like it was made by a child in Arts & Craft.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Funny full of adventure- Makes a fairy tale almost believable. Great for adults to get a smile from and kids should love it. All ages.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Every time The Blind side comes on T. V., I watch and love it. . .so I need to own it.  It is inspiring and shows how the world should run.  Never tire of watching!
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Somethings you can honestly say its not for you. This was one of those. I love musicals but this... No thanks. I didn't even watch it til the end. I think I got about 1/2 way through before I started my house work.
B0094M2H2E|5.0|Excellent family movie. Nothing objectionable.The grandkids loved it. Innocent and lovely. We're always on the lookout for good family movie and this fits the bill.
B004TI5N38|4.0|In true Baldacci style it was exciting, a page turner.  Lots of very real characters and a storyline to keep you wanting to finish the next page and the one after that.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Excellent family movie. Nothing objectionable.The grandkids loved it. Innocent and lovely. We're always on the lookout for good family movie and this fits the bill.
B005LW5J9O|3.0|The Swerve was interesting history, very detailed and fascinating story about the Papacy in medieval times. However, it drug on and on and on. A lesson in how to make a great novel out of a small pamphlet.
B000VX041Q|4.0|Loved the shoe but burgundy color on the actual product looks different from the display picture so had to return.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Having lived through the same time period as the author I have learned to depend on him for providing me with the essence of the issues which plague humans and nation states . To say that he seems to always be one step ahead of world events e.g. drug dumping, carnage over minerals or now the crisis of conscience with state secrets just amazes me. He is a masterful guide and valued voice. His writing in this genre is without equal, Bob D
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I felt the central characters, Pari and Abdullah deserved more attention, particularly Abdullah. What was there was exceptional but, needed more to pull it all together!
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|on my kindle fire I deleted all my games and everything and still cant install it.  Don't get it if you only have 8GB of internal storage.
B00A8LYYI0|2.0|Not as interesting as the first one.  They should have started where they left off from the first on. It was a bit confusing.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I love this band.  When I first listened to &#34;Radioactive&#34; I wanted to listened to more of these guys.  The sound they make coupled with the vocals of the group make the band really tasty to listened to.  I am eager for more from these guys.  I hope their next studio album is as good as Night Visions.  These guys are a really great band.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Pretty good when compared to the books.  Can't wait for 2 and 3 to come out.  Awesome depiction of the story
0756404746|5.0|I love to read, and when I started talking to my friend about Brandon Sanderson and his novels, he suggested to me that I pick up Patrick Rothfuss's \\"The Name of the Wind\\".  I couldn't put this book down, I lost many hours of sleep trying get to the end of the book.  I loved every second of every word of this marvelous book.  If you like a good fantasy to read, then you will love Patrick Rothfuss and his novels.  I am excited to read the second book and the third book (which hasn't been released yet) because I know they will be as good as the first book.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I love musicals but they have to hold my attention and this one really did...I have rented it several times and think I will buy it..even my 10 year old grandson loved it!
B008458O3S|5.0|if you like puzzles and hats to give up, this game is for you!  I'm almost finished ... bunker cause I want more levels!
B002QRWJA4|4.0|The songs were so catchy! And the story line was very engaging. Personally, I'm a fan of certain musicals, and this one was certainly entertaining. Who knew Gerard Butler could sing?
0743270754|5.0|book arrived in \\"excellent\\" condition, not just \\"good\\" as was listed. I was very pleasantly surprised. Haven't started reading yet, but it should be a great read, considering the author. Thank you for the prompt service.
0345803485|5.0|Just got my book in today and I was thinking it would be a used book.... But to my surprise its a brand new book.... Will definitely be buying from this seller.....
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|This is the third book from Ellen that I've read and it was just as fun as ever. She is not only funny but she does it in a way that is not mean, is calm, and genuine. I'm so happy for her and Portia. Maybe she is a rare example of living a happily ever after story? If I were a betting person, I'd say she is!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|clock works great. I would just like it to dim more. even at the lowest setting and the screen n brightness all the way down its still bright
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Great story<br /><br />Scalizi has a lightness in his writing that adds to the story.<br />Read the series it is good reading
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I LOVED THE HUMOR. MOVIE WAS ACTION PACKED AND WITTY. I WILL BE READY TO SEE RED2 AND ENJOY IT
0307957837|5.0|I love this series.  It is a wonderful world of magic and questioning that really transformed my thinking as an adolescent.  I will always recommend this book to anyone.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Had moments of action. And had many funny moments. But almost too many. Guess I have watched the classic Wizard too many times, so this one was kind of a disappointment.
B009RH973I|2.0|I'm fairly new to the tablet/Kindle experience and I must have assumed that all covers put the device to sleep.  After using my Kindle one night, closing the cover and then going back to it the next night, discovered my battery was nearly dead.  Also noticed that closing the cover does not put it to sleep.  Very disappointed and not sure what the point of a cover is without that feature.  I went back to my old cover and this one is sitting in a drawer.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|loved watching this and wish they were still filming ..sad its not on regular TV anymore but happy I can watch it using my PRIME account on Amazon!!!
0345803485|5.0|I loved Fifty Shades of Grey...and if they make a movie, Adam Levine would be perfect.  Listen to If I Never See Your Face Again by Maroon Five, I thought Adam would make a perfect Christian Grey!  Some people who don't like this book, well, you're just another opinion!
B0090SI56Y|4.0|This is sort of \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Wolverine...\\" because much of it takes place in Asia and the women are martial artists. Our hero was near Nagasaki when the A-Bomb was dropped and he saved a Japanese soldier at the time. Many decades later, with the death of his beloved Jean still haunting his dreams, he is summoned to Japan as that same man, now elderly, lays dying.<br /><br />My favorite part of \\"Iron Man 3\\" was when our guy was suddenly stripped of his power. In this one, we see another Marvel superhero become a mere mortal...at least for a time. Wolverine tries to help a young woman who is being pursued by gangsters and killers who are somehow tied to the death of her grandfather. In addition, he also finds himself in dire need of assistance from a young Goth chauffeur/bodyguard.<br /><br />Let's see who's who in this one:<br />  * Hugh Jackman (\\"Real Steel\\" and \\"Les Mis&eacute;rables\\") is, for the sixth time, Logan/Wolverine, our self-repairing immortal who has retreated to the wilderness to grieve for his lost love.<br />  * Famke Janssen (\\"Taken\\" and \\"X-Men\\") joins us courtesy of flashbacks and dreams, as Jean Grey, the woman he adored...and killed...<br />  * Rila Fukushima (\\"Karma: A Very Twisted Love Story\\") is Yukio, Wolverine's maroon-haired bodyguard.<br />  * Tao Okamoto (in her first film) is Mariko, granddaughter of the elderly industrialist who offers to \\"cure\\" Logan of his immortality.<br /><br />There are many, many more characters in this story, but I have named the ones who caught MY eye. Of course we can expect endless fisticuffs and martial arts, along with CGI-driven action, but the fight on the speeding train is worthy of mention, as is our lonely hero's anger and isolation. This is a PG-13 film, so they are allowed one \\"F\\" word...which is used appropriately. I DID object to one scene where our hero has more arrows piercing his body than St. Sebastian! Enough already!<br /><br />Do not join the stampede to the exit when the final credits start to roll: This is a Marvel production, so there WILL be a teaser for their next outing! You'll smile...<br /><br />The DVD from Amazon will have closed captions. I will welcome them!
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|There is nothing wrong with this app. I just don't subscribe to facebook, therefore get no benefit from this game.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|It had a different style than the usual. Good acting and scenery was good as well as the story. i would recommend this DVD.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have always enjoyed the birds, as every new game is added so is the difficulty good for any age.
B001PO53IO|5.0|I decided to upgrade TCW Season 1 to blu ray from DVD.  I was disappointed that the audio track is only Dolby Digital 5.1 640 KB/s and not Dolby TrueHD, but it sounds better than the DVD which is 340 KB/s.  Of course the video quality is much better and easily noticeable.  The fine details a much sharper, too, like the republic insignia on the star fighters in the background in the third episode.  On the DVD the edge detail was a bit fuzzy.  In my DVD set there was a booklet with concept art from the series but this didn't come with my blu ray version from Amazon Market place, but there wasn't really a place for it in the case.  Overall I'm very happy with the upgrade to blu ray and look forward to upgrading season 2 and 3.
B0094M2X6Y|4.0|This was better then the reviews gave it when it was in Theaters.  I understood some things cause i read the books.  It could have used a little backstory to pull it together.
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|I order this book because I'm in love with it. At first they had problems trying to send the book to me since i have problems with my address, but they kept  trying and trying and finally the book arrived. He kept me informed of everything and I'm happy to finally have it in my hands.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Boring book of words though it is useful in some situations where you can not figure out what a word  is
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Usually this isn't the kind of book I would pick up to read--when it was selected for a book club discussion, I thought I would give it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. I'm in the early stages of my career and many, many of the things discussed in the book rang true with me. I also appreciated the candid advice about mentoring, children, how to work with your spouse, and many other things. Highly, highly recommended!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long while.  Characters were believable.  Plot was excellent.  Great read!!  I recommend it highly.
B002OMZTSK|3.0|Without having read other writings by Brent Hartinger, I reserve judgment on style.  It definitely read like it was written from an average high school student, but how could I know if that was the intent or the author's own skill level?  I found the plot and ending totally predictable; and found myself emotionally unengaged much, but not all of the time.  I was not drawn in, with unbridled anticipation...<br /><br />This was an easy read, and I would recommend it for the intended audience, but not for advanced readers, either in age or reading level.  It does have some good moral messages, even if spelled out in detail. It seemed a bit dated with &#34;IMed&#34; vs. &#34;texting&#34;.  Even this old guy caught that.<br /><br />So, if you have a gay teen or young adult, buy this for him or her; they will not be disappointed.<br /><br />J.V. Petretta, author of &#34;An Impossible Dream Story&#34;
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Great set, We love these movies. I just wish it would have came with the DVDs as well like most Blue Rays these days.
B008JFUPZI|5.0|This movie is awesome. I have never heard of the comic books until I saw this movie. i'm a huge comic book movie fan and I absolutely loved this film. not only because it is based on a comic book also because ryan Reynolds and jeff bridges were awesome together their team work made the film. the movie had excellent effects but that does not count for good acting and chemistry. and kevin bacon was awesome as well. the movie is a lot like men in black but with ghosts and demons instead of aliens. but all in all it was a awesome movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
1449410243|2.0|Fun to read once and good for the coffee table when guest are visiting.<br />A bit expense for a one time read.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|This movie is awesome. Disney and Pixar never fails. I was a little skeptical about this movie. but it turned out great. now since they did the prequel now lets see the sequel. I love this movie and the characters are as loveable as the first movie. i'm glad that john goodman and billy crystal came back for their roles. if those two were not in it it would not of been the same. I love this movie. if you have not seen this film then I recommend you do
B0067TGSOK|4.0|This book is a \\"ra-ra,\\" feel good, inspirational, compilation of stories of successful entrepreneurs. I gave it a 4 cuz I was expecting more instructional details. I would suggest another book along with this to compliment its contents, perhaps the Freelancer's Bible, and definitely The 4 hour work week by Tim Ferries. That one blew my mind!!
B001AITH50|5.0|My younger sister was much more impressed than she thought that she would be. I might purchase this film eventually.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Have been playing this game for over a month and all the sudden it will not connect to the server. It is not my Kendel. Everything else works great on it. I just spent $9.99 on pearl and don't want to loose them. Is there any help out there???? Thanks other wise I love the game...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|love it on phone and on my kindle fire. taking computer down kindel will be my only internet access great
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I gave this book four stars because i loved the way Peeta and Katniss had kids but i would have liked it to be with Gale instead but the book was very good! Let's hope the movies are at least half as good as the books were! :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun &amp; addictive!! I love the minions, they are so cute! I got my nephew playing too :-) Did I mention fun &amp; addictive :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is highly recommended by me. If you think this game wont be great your going to regret it!
B004XVMCPI|5.0|Chou it's so visual with his comedy, and very effective with his dramatic sequences. The long distance practice kicks to the brick wall, the ball hitting over and over, sticks out. You will love this movie!
0071636080|3.0|As with other presentation books such as 'Presentation Zen', it does contain bits and pieces of information that are important to any presenter. Coming to the context of the of visuals talked about in the book, they seem to be largely limited to sales presentations of products, or aimed at the creative and it isn't relevant in a number of business oriented presentations.<br /><br />Steve also has the luxury of being able to control the amount of time spent per-topic or product discussed but these are some of the luxuries a large number of presenters do not have in the real world.<br /><br />Two key things I dislike about this book:<br />-Certain sections are repetitive.<br />-I'll credit Jobs for being a great presenter but I can't stand the extent of how Gallo fantasizes over Jobs over multiple chapters of the book.<br /><br />Overall for starters, this is a great book. However if you're looking for a book aimed at providing tips for improving your presentation skills, 'Presentation Zen' would offer you far more pragmatic help than this one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book started out really well but became very gimmicky toward the end. I enjoyed Gillian Flynn's first two novels much more.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|It is a well recorded CD. You don't appreciate his full sound until you hear the horns and distinct back up voices of his group. This CD captures it all.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|After purchasing this game I was unable to play on my tablet.  Could not open game after it was downloaded.
B000UOOT1W|4.0|More Carlos, less J Lo. You can't deny the signature guitar of Carlos Santana. That I liked greatly, but there are some &#34;filler songs.&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am very addicted to this game. I like the graphics this game has and the many levels and characters this game offers.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Good kid friendly show. No scary scenes, which was a big concern for my scaredy cat 3 yr old daughter. No crude jokes which is refreshing.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Disks are fine and work very well, but the box is cracked and chipped but besides that it is very great qulity
B002QE3CTY|5.0|From the first page onward this book was a fast-paced, action-packed thriller. With the ever growing mystery that deepens and unfolds with every page, I easily finished the book in two sittings. I was literally unable to put it down. Hard to choose this book or the Hunger Games!
B005CM1ILQ|5.0|I don't think I've ever seen Child's Play in better quality than it is on this Blu-Ray I love it, it looks like it was made this year and not in the 80's
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|The actual movie was very good. I waited for it to come out on dvd at a lower price and I was not disappointed.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|The Cd is Great, I ordered two copies because the other one was a birthday gift and he loves it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Though I had ways to play netflix or youtube from my blue ray player before, searching for content and displaying was a pain. I had similar problems even with the xbox for content consumption, as input is much better with a device that you use all the time. Its not that its not possible, it is just that its not easy.<br /><br />With this product I found it very easy to choose the content I want to play on TV. Even youtube.com/willow never used to work in my earlier blueray player even with subscription. Yesterday was able to play quite a few videos from there without any hiccup. I havent tried their live broadcasts, so not sure it works 100%.<br /><br />I also have google music subscription. My yamaha receiver doesnt have bluetooth, so it isnt easy to stream digital music to my receiver at home. With this I was able to stream directly to the receiver at very high quality, surely not possible with the gadgets I have at home.<br /><br />I had multiple profiles / users for youtube and music subscription. I was able to smoothly transition between multiple users in a tablet and still chromecast content.<br /><br />I initially tried connecting the dongle to TV and then use optical out to receiver, but that caused the AV source to switch to different in the receiver for every new song (Possibly a bug). I instead connected it to the receiver and things work like a charm.<br /><br />I have seen quite a few gadgets that tries solving this problem. This is the first one I felt solves my needs. I tinker around with stuff quite a bit, so I rarely buy Apple products. I cant compare to Apple TV experience, but can certainly tell it is better for online content consumption than any product using a remote with buttons, including google tv. The experience with the 35$ dongle is sure worth it.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is really good, I love love it. But it does get repetitive. I would give it five stars if they added more features
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game will be the cause of tons of hours lost trying to unlock every game. Most games are fun but some are just ok but it is still worth your time.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I thought that this book was great. It is nice to see how things played out in the end. Mr. Sparks is a great writer!
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Cute cheesy love story. Love the unexpected humor about being a zombie. I would think the same things if I turned into a zombie tomorrow. Quirky. It's similar to the princess and the frog!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its a great game the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is the price is high 3-5 bucks is good.
B006W33UC4|5.0|I am a big Philadelphia Sound and. Motown fan and if you are too.....I highly recommend this 4 set CD....before buying this music, I never heard of Mr. Tom Moulton.....well, I've heard him now....with his beautifully remixes of these classic songs.....I was skeptical at first, not knowing much on what to expect of a remastered/remixed albums....basically, these are the original songs that have extended time frames or longer versions of the song with enhancing sound features by Moulton....professionally done through and through....I will be investigating more of Moultons work and probably will purchase all of them.....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really fun if u love animals! It can be an app for all ages!! You should really get this app.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is cool and I hope the make more levels I think they some goog like like like like like like omg good
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|this is a fun movie for the series, well paced, lots of action and funny quips. if you like this series you will probably like this movie.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I love it,but the ONLY thing is,the all producers need to get rid of all the pop-up,and put more video suggestions..other than that,awesome,works great with my kindle fire HD...keep it up!!
006178480X|3.0|The book is a mostly typical Sigma Force novel.  There some really baffling aspects in the actions of the good guys in particular that make absolutely no sense.  One of the ideas Rollins plays with briefly is the &#34;many worlds&#34; solution to the problem of quantum wave function collapse.  The end of the book is a nod to this, but may look to some readers like a get out of jail free card.  It actually raises quite a number of very profound questions about the nature of identity.  At the same time, the villains are unbelievably motivated.  In fact the motives of one in particular are obscure beyond redemption.  At the same time, the refusal of the team to elucidate the urgency of their business to anyone outside the circle - yes, villains, it affects you as well - is just plain weird.  All in all, I think that Paul Preuss and Arthur C. Clarke handled the quantum issue better in the Venus Prime novels.  Still, an entertaining read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've never read an entire book in my life...I hated reading in school. I never could get past a first chapter. I'm now on the second book.  It's not the sex stuff , it's the characters in the books, that keep me reading...great book, i will read number three book and can't wait..I'm sure I will miss this couple in the end...A must read.................
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Why this Google lovefest? You make it sound like they just invented the wheel. News flash! There are scores of devices out there that already do what Chromecast does except they do it way better!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|More fun than the PC version. Because u just touch things instead of using a mouse it goes easier and faster.
034580404X|5.0|I loved this series and wish there was more! I would reread them all if they were in Christians point of view I loved that at the end and wanted more! cant wait for the movie.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excelent. I loved the intertwined characters stories along with the history, I'm eager to start the next book on this series..
1781162646|5.0|Joyland is one of Stephen King's best books, and almost as moving as 11/23/63. You could call it a crime mystery, you could call it a ghost story, it's all that and more--just a wonderful story.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great game it is kind of like Mario , great for passing time ,and good for all ages
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|Seemed to mainly be a sampling of multiple Cirque shows that are currently running. Didn't feel completely cohesive as a film.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Game play is like playing when you were younger. It gives you the sense of playing classic card games that are good that you played as you were growing up.
B000I9X53W|5.0|Love this movie. Dustin Hoffman made quite a transformation both physically and psychologically preparing for this role. Getting a little dated but still great.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Same good ending for the series which I watched for its ten year run, will watch again and again. bye.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Hulu may have to rethink their strategy. No longer is your internet (and streaming movies) contained to your laptop.<br />I somehow lucked out and happened to be at BestBuy as the truck was delivering. Great store rep went to the back and dug one out for me, I wish now I would have bought more after seeing them on Ebay and Amazon for $75+.<br /><br />Chromecast is preforming great with mobile streaming - youtube and FREE netflix (no longer available)<br /><br />Only issue so far is streaming from laptop as there are slight jitters and a 2-3 sec delay. This could be my laptop showing its age<br /><br />Set up is supper simple<br />Download an app for your device (only needed on one, all others detect the device on your network and the option is available immediately), set up on your network and download an extension for laptops and your set.<br /><br />Only from google could come up with something this nice for this price.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|always liked stargate and this was a good ending to the series that year, I watch it from time to time.
B009WUBERW|5.0|I think it was better than the first. Lots of 80's action stars. Can't wait for the third one with Jackie chan
B00DUCXFUC|1.0|If you are like most Christopher Nolan Batman fans then you've probably bought all 3 movies on Blu-ray already, which means you already own 90% of what comes in this collection. So what stuff does your hard earned money get you that you don't yet own? a couple of cheap Hot Wheel cars, a set of photo cards, and 2 new short documentaries That you might enjoy watching once but will leave you wanting more, oh but wait, there isn't any more, no deleted/extended scenes, no additional cast interviews/behind the scenes, no outtakes, nothing that this set for the price should have. There is absolutely NO reason to buy this \\"Ultimate Collectors edition\\".
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! It was difficult at first, but I enjoy it so much, I get better each time I play. The minions are so cute.
0345803485|1.0|Written like a Penthouse forum piece.  The imaginative ramblings of a horny teenager, more like.  So cliche, that I was able to imagine the next sentence myself without actually reading it.  Silly, boring, and absolutely not worth the time.  Not even an interesting story line.  I am no prude, and was not shocked by any of it...just bored.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was a very interesting story about a part of society I don't often think about.  As a teacher I really felt for the main character and her lack of guidance as she grew and developed as an abandoned orphan.  The story shows all too well what happens to children who aren't taught basic life skills and provided a loving environment.  This character did not even know what love was or what to do when she encountered it.  Somehow through all adversity she survives and makes the most of what she has which was inspiring, though I often struggled with her choices.  I really liked the knowledge of flowers that she uses to ground her life.  The story was gritty and real and not predictable with a perfect happy ending.
B005SLS3ZU|3.0|I thought the book was far fetched and one could tell how it was going to end. I was disappointed in it for I have read much better from this author

B008HK3XOU|5.0|I'm quite satisfied with this cover, after about a month of use. It's not bulky. Its non-skid surface holds the Kindle Fire HD at any reasonable angle when you're reading horizontally. It will stand the device up vertically but only at a 90 degree angle. It puts the device to sleep when you close the cover and wakes it up when you open it. You can plug the charge cord it with the cover closed. And the bright red adds a welcome splash of color.
B00AAQHP66|4.0|I ordered this after having it recommended based on other movies I have ordered. It was a typical coming of age story with some warm moments. The most redeeming quality were the scenes when they were surfing.....a nice little movie for a quiet evening......just don't expect too much.
B004SIP7AS|4.0|Emma is a terrible matchmaker. Using social class instead of true interest and likes she is always making errors of judgement with regards to affairs of the heart. About the middle of the pack for Jane Austin Movies. If it's hard to keep up with dialog (they speak fast) use closed captioning so you don't miss a single comic interaction.
B007EECSFA|1.0|I really liked another of her books, but this one bored me to tears.  I made it to 30%  but could not continue.  Lost interest.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|This is a very disappointing movie. If you are hoping for a movie along the lines of Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility or even Emma you will be sorely disappointed. It's not romantic, or beautifully filmed. It's silly, you can't keep tract of who's who and the dialog is very hard to understand.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This movie is joyful, sad, touching.  I hate wasting my time with silly flicks that are about a whole bunch of nothing.  This movie was time well spent.  It moved me.  The acting was fabulous; the scenery breathtaking.  Watch it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Started playing at 8 just to check it out and 2 hours later forcing myself to put it away, so much fun and really cute.

B001OGWY1W|4.0|Move Over Jack Nicholson and Micheal Keaton. As good as they were as Joker and Batman, they were out done by Heath Ledger(R.I.P.) and Christian Bale. I still like Michael Gough as &#34;Alfred the Butler&#34; over Michael Caine. They did a great job on turning Harvey Dent into Harvey Two-Face. He was just creepy lookin'.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was how strong they made The Joker's gang. I just didn't believe that a villain could have that many connections. Even Tony Soprano didn't have the connections that The Joker had.<br /><br />But overall, &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; was really good and I would recommend it to almost anybody.
0307346617|5.0|I can't stop reading this book.  It's so much more than a book about zombies - it's POVs from every country and every type of person in the world regarding how they dealt with this horrific development.  I've read it at least 6 times now.  This is the zombie book that all zombie books should strive to be.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|The only thing that took me out of the movie at times was &#34;holy s*it, that makeup on Tom Hanks is awesome&#34;.<br /><br />But really...it's brilliant.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This was easy to set up. Up and running in less than 5 minutes.<br /><br />I am watching videos in Chrome tabs (pro Starcraft II games!!!).<br /><br />One thing I wish for: I don't seem to be able to watch the video when I pop it out to its own window. Only the regular chrome tabs seem to have the cast button.<br /><br />It is good that I can be playing one tab to the TV, but looking at other tabs on the computer (like reading my mail while playing the show).<br /><br />It is good that I can put the video in the tab into full screen and it goes to full screen on the TV, too. But then not sure I can look at another tab.

B00D6BN9NK|1.0|(Note: Amazon took down my earlier review, probably because of the language that was used. Here's a slightly tweaked version that meets their expectations.)<br /><br />Director: John Moore.<br /><br />Writer: Skip Woods.<br /><br />Staring: Bruce Willis, Jai Courtney, Sebastian Koch, Radivoje Bukvić, Yuliya Snigier and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.<br /><br />Running Time: 97 minutes.<br /><br />Rated: R for Violence and Language.<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />I'm not a person to get bored easily. I can be easily amused by even the pettiest of entertainment from time to time. But when a film has car crashes, helicopter fights, swear words, big firefights and other such things and I'm bored to feath, there's something horribly wrong in the world. Such is the case with A Good Day to Die Hard or Die Hard 5, which ever strikes your fancy.<br /><br />I've only seen two Die Hard movies in my life: The first one and the fourth one. The first film is often seen as a classic in action - and to an extent, Christmas - cinema, combining great action, suspense, performances, a charismatic villain, good plotting and its very likable and relatable protagonist by the name of John McClane, played by the always ready and willing Bruce Willis.<br /><br />The fourth one, Live Free Or Die Hard, has some contention with the fanbase. While it was a critical and commercial success, some viewed it as taking away the Die Hard spirit with a PG-13 rating and the fact John McClane was driving cars into helicopters. To me, it never really bothered me and while I only watched that film once, I do remember having fun with it, with it's interesting take on cyber terrorism and the fact that McClane was taking on a baddie who isn't like other folks he dealt with before.<br /><br />Now how could I summarize the plot of A Good Day to Die Hard? Well, I wish I could give you, the reader, some kind of way to provide a synopsis of this film, so I'll do so the best I can. So, McClane  goes to Russia to meet up with a son he never had never met before, Jack McClane (Jai Courtney). Jack is actually working on a case with the CIA protecting a witness in a trail, Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch), who is caught up in a Nuclear weapon heist. Right when the trial is about to begin, a bunch of baddies show up and attempt to kidnap Komarov. Soon, John and Jack must get over their family issues and team up to protect Komarov or something like that.<br /><br />Attempting to get invested in the film's plot is like trying to perform nuclear science. Every single character in the film is basically a cardboard cutout, without a nice tasty amount of cliche slapped on `em. We get almost no character development or we barely get to know them. Hell, the kid goes from hating his dad to loving him near the end and it comes off forced as hell. This one villain played by Radivoje Bukvic, lacks any kind of menace or charisma in the film. His most memorable scene is him kicking the guns away from our main heroes, tap dancing and eating a Carrot. And when its revealed of who the true bad guy is (yes, we're dealing with one of those again), even when I had it spoiled for myself, it still came off as a really pathetic twist.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, the film is just flat out boring. Right from the get go, there is no flair or joy from this film. All of it, from the editing to the pacing and looks, it all feels workman-like. Oh sure, characters crack wise and the McClanes spew playful insults at each other but it all ends up feeling so incredibly hollow. Hell, I'm one of those people that will defend a movie by saying \\"It's just a movie! Deal with it!\\" and even here, I had a really hard time buying things like McClanes jumping into an obviously radiated pool of water and surviving or John surviving an insane car chase with nary a scratch, And on the acting side of things, it just gets worse from there.<br /><br />Bruce Willis just looks bored here. Hell, everyone does. No one hams it up in any capacity or has fun with what they are doing. It's almost as if everyone here is phoning it in just to get themselves a tasty paycheck, which given the material, is pretty understandable. I'm also under the slight impression that everyone who was in the making of the film was taking some kind of amphetamine or something, just do get through the days of shooting.<br /><br />One has to wonder who the hell wrote and directed this. Previous Die Hard movies usually have either loads or some degree of talent behind the camera but they came up short with director John Moore, who's previous works include a shot-for-shot remake of The Omen and the film adaptation of Max Payne. Meanwhile, screenwriting duties were given to Skip Woods, who's resume includes such works like X-Men Origins Wolverine and Hitman. These men are not directors and screenwritiers; They are goddamn boot-licking leeches that got lucky. That is all.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I found the action to be pretty decently shot. While others jump on the gun and yell \\"Shaky Cam\\", I could always tell what was going on, even during it more crazier moments. The only problem it becomes a problem to see is near the end, thanks to the poor lighting during the night time scenes. Christ, it made feel like I was watching the opening of The Avengers all over again, but without the benefit of knowing I'd get something good out of it. Meanwhile, the CG used in the film is questionable at best. At times, it really shows that it is fake as hell in the most numbing of ways.<br /><br />If there are any good things to say about the film, I would say that the film does come off as gun-porn at times, which is nice I guess. There's also a semi-charming scene between McClane and a Russian cabbie as they talk about Frank Sinatra and how s***ty the traffic is. Unsurprisingly, that's one of the film's most publicized scenes.<br /><br />To summarize myself before I get the desire to claw out my eyeballs with a pair of trimming shears, don't even bother watching A Good Day To Die Hard. Dull action, a silly and incomprehensible plot, bland acting, and poor character development mar this film to hell and back. And to those that say \\"I can't shut off my brain and just watch the movie\\", I say this:<br /><br />Do you know what's a good action movie that I can turn my brain off to? The Crank films. Bad Boys II. The first Transformers flick. Armageddon. There's plenty of dumb as hell movies I can shut my brain off and sit back and watch, but AGTDH is not one of them.<br /><br />It's a real shame that something like this can get greenlit while a good R-Rated action flick like DREDD bombs at the box office. Hell, a goddamn trailer for Sharknado looks like it has more invention and charm than this entire movie. What kind of cinema-going world do we live today, anyway? I'm not going to go on a rant about the death of cinema, like some film snob-wannabe, but Jesus Christ, all I can do is just sight in disappointment.themselves a tasty paycheck, which given the material, is pretty understandable.

B002Q1YDLI|5.0|At first, I was overwhelmed at how selfish and self-centered Darcy is/was. At the end , you can't help rooting for her. I couldn't put the book down and fell in love with the story. I highly recommend it to anyone who believes in the power of love & forgiveness.

B00COHIFQS|3.0|didn't like the end, had a couple of good parts, not worth the time it took to watch it. blahh
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I found this book a little difficult at the beginning, introduction of many characters and I has some difficulty keeping everyone straight. However, it all came together in the final 2 chapters and I found it enjoyable. Also a little too long, think the story/message could have been told a bit more succinctly. I do enjoy the writer's style and he is always very descriptive.
0765350386|4.0|The beginning is a bit slow as Sanderson introduces you to his world of allomancers and feruchemists but picks up after a hundred pages or so and becomes a delight to read.  The story of a street urchin turned revolutionary fighting against a government and a god oppressing her people for the last few thousand years.

B002GKQ5MY|5.0|I love watching the L word because it allows me to watch the drama without being a part of it. The show gives both realistic and totally Hollywood versions of what lesbian life is like. Its very good at drawing you into the show, although at times it does get a bit petty. Very explicit at times.
B00000K413|5.0|You certainly can't say all of Tears for Fears' music sounds the same.  This CD is nothing like the pop sounds of &#34;Songs from the Big Chair&#34; or the smooth and sophisticated stuff from the &#34;The Seeds of Love.&#34;.  As Tears for Fears first offering, this CD is heavy on synth and raw emotion.  I owned the cassette in the 80s and the music stands the test of time.  Many people can relate to the messages of painful recollections from a difficult childhood.  Still relevant and good, quality music.

1419819364|1.0|Terrible remake, the original is much better and cheaper too.  In this one Wonka is a pale faced weirdo who thinks its amusing to be rude every two seconds.  The factory itself is a dark cavelike thing and there are some scenes that are more like a horror film. There is also racism being hinted at; the oompa loompas are african american instead of orange, and in one scene the afro oompa loompa was watching oprah and then changed the channel to watching monkeys for quite a while.  Im not afro american but all I could think was wth?!??  You are now warned.
B003FFEX8C|5.0|I loved this movie! Great addition for any super hero fan. Me and my kid's enjoyed watching it together, especially my daughter who loves cat woman.
1582406723|5.0|Robert Kirkman's little comic has blown up in the past few years. I started reading the comic about 5 years ago when a friend introduced me to it. After the first 3 issues, I was hooked. I bought the first compendium when it came out and I've been collecting these trade paperbacks over the years.<br /><br />The art is fantastic, but the writing is what matters here. In such a dark tale, you come to truly care about every single one of the characters and you soon realize that other survivors can be far more of a threat than the walkers. These themes are explored in Telltale's Walking Dead game and the AMC television series, but in my opinion the comic is king. Throughout these first 8 issues you truly become invested in Rick's struggles and adventures and you will finish the book craving more (and there's lots more).
B003UYUP58|5.0|Gives one a lot to think about.  Would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a perspective about our medical system.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I would have rated this book 5 1/2 Stars, but the ending was a little to be desired.  This was suppose to be a &#34;TRILOGY&#34; and she should have kept it at that and just started another series.  I was a bit disappointed don't just go on and on &#34;END IT.&#34;  If we like the writer we will keep reading her without leaving us hanging like she did bringing this book out months after the first two.  I will probably give her books a break and wait until all books are out before starting another trilogy with her!!

0062280228|3.0|After all the synopsis&#34; it make little sense for me to retell the story.  basically this is a book for Middle Schoolers who enjoy being spooked by what they read.  The writing was good, characters a bit thin, especially the family.  Think Peter Pan.  The ending needs no spoiler alert because it is rather unsurprising. perhaps it was written with a movie in mind. This is a quick, easy and mindless read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very good game. Figuring out the clues can be difficult, but that adds to the quality! It takes a lot of patience.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|A must-see. This perfect combination of melodrama and action makes this masterfully timed action comedy an absolute pleasure to watch.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Hello everyone! Even though this is my first Amazon review, it is definitely not my first movie review. I must say that this was an AWESOME movie!<br /><br />To start with, the casting was well done. Tom Cruise played a character named Jack, a clean- up crew guy who fixes drones. If you don't like Tom Cruise as an actor,then you can at least like the character he is playing. Jack is a totally believable character, a confused man trying to remember his life before his memory was wiped. While he would go out to fix drones, he would also try and find things that reminded him of his previous home. He can't exactly choose what he does, he kinda just has to do his job and then leave, which he really doesn't want to do. I like that about the movie; it always seems as though the characters are real, it was like Tom was born to play the role. The rest of the crew,consisting of familiar faces like Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurymento, also fit their roles quite nicely.<br /><br />The plot was interesting, and I think the trailer explains it pretty thoroughly, but I'll tell you anyway. So there is the huge war between these aliens and humans, and (yay!) the humans win. They didn't really save the earth though... only half of it remains somewhat liveable. With what they are given, most of the human race moves to the Moon Titan, the one that revolves around Jupiter. As I said before, Jack comes along along with Victoria, both led by Sally, who have to clean up up Earth a bit and fix the drones that they made to analyse for the aliens. That's all I am going to say because I really don't want to spoil it for you.<br /><br />The graphics surpassed all of my expectations, everything in the movie looked real. It was all so futuristic and high tech, but it all looked plausible. You felt like you were flying in that jet sometimes, and that was also a nice feature.<br /><br />So, as a whole, I can't exactly tell you how I feel about every part of the movie, but I did enjoy myself while watching it. You should watch this movie if the following traits fit you: You are above 13 years of age(for violence, brief nudity, and language), you like sci-fi post-apocolyptic worlds, stuff that blows up, amazing graphics, and scenes that may make you cry from loveydoveyness.<br /><br />5/5 stars!ching it.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|I really liked this book, and its &#34;adventure task&#34; of finding out the mystery(ies) at Mr. Penumbra's bookstore and its clientele.
B0073SPDHM|5.0|We have had a copy of this book since it came out.  We love the recipes so much that we have worn out the original and now have a new paperback as well as the Kindle edition.  I make a few changes in the recipes that fit our family's needs:<br /><br />1) I like to cook my ice cream base to eliminate the possibility of salmonella poisoning.  To do this, I whip the eggs and sugar but heat about half of the milk/cream mixture to boiling and gradually add it to the egg mixture.  When blended, I put it back in the pot and heat over medium high heat until the sauce reaches 160 degrees.  I cool the pot in ice; the rest of my liquids are still in the fridge, so once the cooked base is cold I am ready to mix the rest in and freeze.<br /><br />2) Since more than half of the people who live here are lactose intolerant, I usually use coconut milk instead of cream in the recipes, and a lactose-free milk instead of regular milk.  A side benefit is that coconut milk has about half the fat of heavy cream.

B007THA4FI|5.0|All politics are local proves true in this unusual offering by J.K. Rowling.  This story of a small town and its residents is both subtle and hard-hitting.  The layers of the story begin to unfold as the sudden death of a council member, Barry Fairbrother, leaves what is called a casual vacancy on the board.  Rowling pulls no punches as she allows the reader to get to know each of her dozen or so characters.  On the surface some are drug addicts, adulterers, and over-ambitious small town politicians.  Yet, as Rawling slowly peels back the layers of the story, we begin to understand how each character came to be.  More importantly, we begin to understand the casual vacancy created by Fairbrother was not only on the council but also in the lives of the townspeople.<br /><br />The story is raw with truth about human nature and is not a lazy day at the beach read.  However,  Casual Vacancy is a novel with a powerful message.  One person can enhance so many lives and when that influence is no longer there...often chaos ensues.  Casual Vacancy will leave you glad you read it.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Keith Richards is an excellent writer, and his memoir is fascinating, funny, and informative. It's a long book, but I enjoyed every single page. Yeah, it may be a bit self-indulgent, but it's a MEMOIR, and it's fun reading about his life, foibles, and accomplishments. My only wish is that the photographs had been displayed at strategic points throughout the Kindle edition rather than all at the end.

034580709X|5.0|For some reason, Jo Nesbo's first novel --- originally released in Europe back in 1997 --- is not being released for the first time in the U.S. (following all of his other novels).<br /><br />The good news is that, even though it is the first in the outstanding Inspector Harry Hole series, it reads like a stand-alone novel as the action is set in Australia.  Harry Hole (pronounced Holy) is observing a murder case set in Sydney, Australia, whereby a young Norwegian woman was murdered.  Even though he was told to stay out of the investigation, Hole becomes intimately involved in both the interviews and also befriends the local Investigator who accompanies him (an Aboriginal Detective).<br /><br />The term 'The Bat' comes from the Aboriginal symbol for death.  It appears there is a serial rapist/killer at large and the victims have been scattered throughout the land Down Under.  The plot is continually surprising (with major characters eliminated in surprising fashion) and completely unpredictable.  This is a great novel and shows whey Jo Nesbo is one of the top crime writers on the planet.

B008JFUQ3O|5.0|My name is Norma and I'm a Minion junkie.<br /><br />In Despicable Me, they were the bickering followers of supervillain Gru (voiced by the always funny Steve Carell), who adopted three little girls as part of one of his evil plots. In Despicable Me 2, Gru, now a devoted dad, has reformed and is attempting to start a legitimate business. He's turned his lab into a high-tech kitchen for making jellies and jams. Too bad nobody, including the Minions, likes the stuff they're making. His longtime sidekick, Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), grows restless--as restless as a hard-of-hearing geezer mad scientist can possibly be--and decides to leave Gru's lab and go back to evildoing with another supervillain. Gru reluctantly says goodbye to his soon-to-be-former accomplice and the Minions give Nefario a twenty-one fart gun salute (yep,I said fart gun--it wasn't a typo).<br /><br />When the Minions start to disappear, Gru doesn't notice--at first. He's busy deflecting the matchmaking attempts of an annoying neighbor and his own daughters. The youngest, Agnes, struggles with her role in a Mothers Day pageant at her school, feeling the lack of a mother of her own. Gru is also concerned that eldest daughter Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), now a teenager, has discovered boys.<br /><br />Enter Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig, who provided the voice of snarky orphanage director Miss Hattie in the original film), an agent for the Anti-Villains League, who kidnaps Gru and Minions Stuart and Dave and takes them to AVL headquarters, where AVL Director Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) tries to recruit Gru to help find a supervillain who possesses a dangerous formula that turns anyone injected with it into an unstoppable purple killing machine. He and Lucy end up partners, but at first they can't get along, and every attempt they make to find the supervillain ends badly...starting with a restaurant break-in, during which they run afoul of a chicken (sorry, I couldn't resist).<br /><br />When little Agnes declares that Gru loves Lucy, Gru not only denies it, he insists he doesn't even like Lucy. Typical male...denying his feelings right up to the moment he says \\"I do!\\"<br /><br />The AVL thinks they've found their man when wigmaker Floyd (Ken Jeong) is arrested. Gru is dismissed in spite of his insistence that restaurateur Eduardo (voiced by Benjamin Bratt) is the real culprit...and with Nefario's help is turning the Minions into monsters. By the time his suspicions are proven correct, Lucy is on a flight to Australia and her next assignment.<br /><br />Will Lucy return? Does Nefario's conscience get the better of him? Do Gru and Lucy have a future together? Will Margo, Edith and Agnes finally get a mom? And what of the Minions? Will they be yellow and cute again in time for next year's Minion Movie?<br /><br />I can't wait for the DVD!ttle Agnes declares that Gru loves Lucy, Gru not only denies it, he insists he doesn't even like Lucy.

B00CL0J99K|5.0|Darker than the two previous Iron Man movies, Iron Man 3 is a cautionary tale. It reminds me, oddly enough, of an episode of the TV series Touched By An Angel, in which the angel Monica, in an uncharacteristic bad mood, snaps at someone, setting off a chain of events that results in a woman's suicide. One never knows what impact a seemingly unimportant act or comment might have on another.<br /><br />At the start of the film, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), in voice-over, says that he created two of his own demons. He recalls the events of New Year's Eve 1999. His callous treatment of two idealistic young scientists, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), at a party in Switzerland set into motion a thirteen-year quest for revenge that would lead to countless deaths and destruction.<br /><br />When Tony must face those demons, the timing couldn't be worse. He's been struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder since his all-too-close brush with death in New York (in The Avengers). He's unable to sleep. He's plagued by self-doubt. He builds one Iron Man armor after another, for a grand total of forty-eight. He worries that he can't protect the one thing--the one person--he can't live without: Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), now CEO of Stark Industries. Yet in his manic state, he seems to be neglecting her, and that worries his friend and former bodyguard, now head of Stark security, Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau)--especially when Aldrich Killian shows up at Stark Industries one day, presumably in search of funding for his Extremis project (which reminds me a lot of the supersoldier project in Captain America: The First Avenger).<br /><br />Extremis is one of those discoveries that, in the right hands, could have been a gift to humanity--but it's in the hands of a madman, and it's dangerously flawed. But is the madman the Asian terrorist who calls himself The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), or is it Killian himself? Not everything in Iron Man 3 is what it appears to be.<br /><br />The movie could be subtitled Tony Stark Finally Grows Up, because until now, he's been, for the most part, a big kid with a lot of really cool toys. He's the boy who never thought his father loved him. I've often wondered what his relationship with his mother was like, and what role it played in his inability to commit to Pepper through two movies and countless comic books. A shrink could make a career of this guy.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 is more about Tony Stark than it is about Iron Man. As he searches for the identity of his enemy, he also searches for his own identity in his post-Avengers world, and what he discovers in the midst of all the explosions, battles and confrontations is, I think, as surprising to him as it will be to his audience. I loved it--as always, RDJ delivers the rapid-fire wit in abundance, and though there's less banter between him and Paltrow this time around, there's some funny dialogue between him and best buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle), who hates having to trade in War Machine for Killian's flashier Iron Patriot armor--Rhodey's password, WARMACHINEROCKS, pretty much says it all. There's also some great scenes between Tony and a young Tennessee boy (Ty Simpkins) that makes me wonder--could there be a baby in Tony and Pepper's future?it appears to be.<br /><br />The movie could be subtitled Tony Stark Finally Grows Up, because until now, he's been, for the most part, a big kid with a lot of really cool toys.

B00E25KVLW|5.0|What I noticed first is that you're really put on rails from the start on. If you simply follow the book from the first page to the last there is really no chance to get lost or that one would need to know things that haven't been explained before.<br />It starts with chapters on how to install your Rails environment on Linux, Windows and MacOS and climbs up the ladder to general concepts of how to write good Rails applications including helpful tips for common use cases. I liked the chapter about \\"Internationalization\\", since a lot of books tend to forget that there are more character sets and languages in the world than ASCII and English.<br />I specifically like the less academic, hands-on style of this book and it is really fun to read and to try the exmamples right away. I'm sure if you're new to Rails you'll find this book also really useful and even the experienced will find some of the chapters a good read - I guess.

COPY the file name (Cnt C), 4. go back to chrome and paste the file name in to the address file:  /home/files/TV Shows/?????.mp4  5. click the CAST botton and go watch you show.<br />this worked with Ubuntu base desktop.  it should work for all others as well.<br />STILL running in to other technical issues:  i can CAST VOD of the desktop running ubuntu, but can't CAST the same show running on Win 7 platform.  not sure whey.  CAN CAST HULU from both platforms.  the casting is still in BETA form, so i'm keeping my rating at 4 for now.Win 7 platform.  not sure whey.

0439023513|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy was enthralling. The story line is unique. The characters on both sides of &#34;the games&#34; are living in a dysfunctional society. Fear rules them, hunger rules them, distrust rules them. There is no working together because they are being watched, they are imprisoned in sections with no way to communicate with others. And then they have to face the yearly game of people being selected to fight each other to the death. A classic story of a harsh communist type government that is ruling with fear.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love love LOVE the minions and just game just encourages my obsession even more. this is the best game ever
140006922X|5.0|I bought the book to read it unlike some others who haven't even read the book and started to comment on it.  Perhaps Islamophobes or people who simply hate religion no matter what decided to give it one star and start complaining.  Please don't buy into most of the negative reviews who simply hate Muslims or anyone who believes in notion of a \\"different\\" God or God period.<br /><br />Reza Aslan writes about the most mysterious man in the world. Some historians go as far to write that Jesus did not exist at all. Aslan's extensive research proves Jesus in fact existed, but not the Jesus you learn in Sunday School.  This book is not to deter you from your faith.  Watching the interview with Joe Scarborough on MSNBC made me think people automatically assume Aslan is discrediting Jesus.<br /><br />Aslan goes as far as finding Biblical text and comparing it to what really happened in history. If one really studies Christianity you'd find that the gospels were not written during the time of Jesus of Nazareth. People who have faith in Jesus as a deity might not be too happy with the book, but that's the way it is. Whether you have faith or not the book Zealot is not an opinion. This book might even be taught in Universities.<br /><br />Most Christians think Muslims put Prophet Muhammad in a higher pedestal and he is the only prophet or we worship him.  Prophet Muhammad is only mentioned less than 4 times in the Quran and Jesus over 40 times in the Quran as Son of Virgin Mary. It's interesting the a Jesuit Priest reverted Aslan into Islam.<br /><br />Like Aslan you can do your own research before making judgement whether Zealot is just an opinion. Perhaps the book could also be called \\"The Jesus You Never Knew\\". Very sad though people can't get over a fact that facts are facts and faith is up to you.  Whatever floats everyone's  Naoh's Ark.

Its almost perfect I love every song except &#34; Execrator&#34; so I just burned my own disc and replaced it with &#34; Night City&#34; from Warp Riders making the perfect album.   I liked the album so much that I ordered the other albums of theirs and was really disapointed, I do like several songs from Warp Riders. The other albums seem to focus more on speed type metal with not much on the vocals, the mixing, production or whatever seems very poor on the first two albums, its alot better on Warp Riders and this one.   Like I stated earlier this is one of my all-time favorite albums and The Sword by far are the best, new to me ,band that I have heard in 14-15 years,on this album alone.   There is a major difference in the first two and these last two albums.This one is a gem!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So much power in such a small package. There are hundreds of great reviews of its other features, so I will focus on just one, using the Chromecast for presentations. While you cannot currently broadcast from PowerPoint or Keynote (although these features could be developed in the future), the Chromecast can easily be used to display your Google Drive Presentation, or a Prezi, or any other web based presentation. iPad users love to hook up their AppleTV to a projector and walk around with an iPad, and this should enable Android users to do the same thing. If you use PowerPoint, simply upload your presentation to Google Drive to broadcast. You could also use SlideShare or any other web based presentation service.<br /><br />1) You need a wifi network connected to the Internet.<br />The Chromecast pulls most content directly from the Internet, so you will need to be able to connect the Chromecast to the Internet. You will also need for your laptop to be on the same network as the Chromecast.<br /><br />2) Point your Chrome browser to your presentation.<br />Open your Chrome browser to the presentation, and anything you can see in the browser tab will be broadcast.<br /><br />3) Click the Google Cast extension to broadcast that tab.<br />You can even put your laptop in full screen mode and the display at the Chromecast still shows the full slide.<br /><br />Questions<br />-----------<br />** Can I use a presentation remote?<br />Sure. Most presentation remotes work fine with Google Drive. I use a [[ASIN:B002GHBUTU Logitech Professional Presenter R800 with Green Laser Pointer]].<br /><br />** Can I view speaker notes or do other things with my laptop during the presentation without disrupting the display?<br />Yes. Only the tab with the presentation will be broadcast, so anything else you do will not disrupt the presentation. Just don't close Chrome.<br /><br />** Does the presentation need to be public, or can I present a private \\"unpublished\\" presentation?<br />I don't know the answer, but I will try it today and get back to you.<br /><br />** Can I drive a presentation with my tablet?<br />I have not figured out how yet, but surely this will be a feature soon.<br /><br />** Can I mark up the slides, highlight or zoom in?<br />If the web based service allows you to draw or highlight on the slides, then yes! You can zoom in using Chrome's zoom feature.

It easily replaced my big expensive apple TV (yea, compare to this, apple TV is big expensive).

B008JFUP0I|3.0|I really don't have anything bad to say about Fast and Furious 6 as an action movie.<br /><br />It really stands up to the title, delivering an explosive, entertaining, fast-paced, furious action film, with fast cars, fast women, and fast guns. What more could you ask for in a Fast and Furious movie?<br /><br />Every element that makes a successful action film is right here:<br />Tough guys. Tough girls. Muscle cars. Chases. Martial arts. Guns. Shootouts. A tank. Explosions. Humour. One-liners. Oh yeah, and the Rock, who is one of those actors, like Christopher Lee and Benedict Cumberbatch, that has been scientifically proven to make every film 33.33% better! I predicted this would be a box-office success right from the beginning. Right from the gate, Fast 6 shows it's true colors: a ludicrously fun, outrageously unrealistic, entertaining, boom-bang popcorn film. And as that, it delivers, ninety-nine-point-ninety-nine percent!<br /><br />The set pieces are absolutely amazing. I am here to say on hand that the Tank Chase was one of the best chases/action scenes of 2013 so far! The airplane chase was absurd but entertaining (I loved Diesel's flying headbutt!), and the girlfight between Michelle Rodriguez and Gina Carano (A real MMA fighter) was well choreographed and pretty brutal.<br /><br />As a film for the more demanding viewer, like me, it came up slightly flat. Shaw is played excellently by Luke Evans (Immortals, The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug!), but the character is never given any motive or meaning to his actions other than: This guy's bad, he wants to shut down America with a computer chip. You could argue that's all you need in an action film, but yeah, it was slightly underwhelming.<br /><br />Gina Carano's \\"twist\\" added a neat, erm, twist (pun intended) on her and Michelle Rodriguez's next fight. But it also rendered completely moot and unfathomable all of her previous actions. Really, watch the film, and then watch it again watching what she does. It makes no sense.<br /><br />But hey, really, who said Fast and Furious movies have to make sense? This is a movie where the Rock jumps 30 feet from an overpass onto a moving car. This is a movie where people treat cars more expensive than a small third-world country like bulldozers. This is a movie whose climax takes place on a runway some handy cinephiles and an engineer worked out to be 29 miles long. The world's longest runway? 5 miles. But the reason it works so well is that Fast and Furious 6, like it's predecessor Fast 5, embraces and even flaunts it's OTT attitude. The result? An entertaining film, but one where you must leave your brain at the door. Not even - leave it at the parking lot outside.<br /><br />In conclusion, Fast and Furious is ludicrous, absurd, and silly. And it's also a riveting, very fun and entertaining action film that shows everything is going well under it's shiny chrome hood. This is an action engine in 5th gear!<br /><br />Enough with the car metaphors already. 3.7 Stars! Recommended!<br /><br />P.S. I would like to give a shout-out to Tauheed Epps and Cameron Thomaz, aka 2 Chainz and Wiz Khalifa for their completely awesome song We Own It, which features in the credits of this film! 5 Stars for that song, yeah!<br /><br />P.P.S. The post-credit's scene has got to be the best 30 second action film I have ever seen. James Lin ends his film with a brutal twist leaving viewers yearning for a sequel. Or should I say, a sevenquel? The Fast and Furious franchise has proven to be one of the most enduring of all action franchises, and I wish it good luck in the future. But here's hoping we never have to see Faster and Furiouser and Furiouser 17:  Engine Trouble in Malibu.es no sense.<br /><br />But hey, really, who said Fast and Furious movies have to make sense?

B004ZA9HB4|4.0|Really useful, it just crashes when running in the background, sometimes...apart from that it works just fine<br />It could be great if it played the regular way in all the modes of the iPad.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|It gives me excellent connection in my college dorm room and it's so much faster than the Wi-Fi or using a USB to Ethernet adapter!
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|So much fun to watch. She really is an amazing and talented person. Great doc to watch. Recommend it to everyone.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love the free rounds. I also love the seasons room. I play that room all the time! My kids love to sit with me and play too.
B000GCFBQU|2.0|I never could really get into this book.  I thought it would go somewhere and it never did.  It seemed like the events didn't connect well.  Also, it seemed that the book ended suddenly.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I've tried several different file managers, and while they were good, none were as feature rich as this one. To be fair I didn't use any of the others long after discovering this one, so some features here may also be supported on those apps.<br /><br />I've used this app to:<br /><br />* Transfer files between my Nook HD+ and my Nexus 4 via Bluetooth.<br />* Transfer files between my PCs, Nook HD+ and Nexus 4 via FTP server.<br />* Play media content on my Nook HD+ that the default launcher/UI claimed was unsupported; nope, played just fine when launched via this app!<br /><br />Aside from those features, here are a few more that I really like and use often:<br /><br />* Quick access to bookmarked locations.<br />* Supports remote access to FTP servers and Windows file shares (home media center for example).<br /><br />Additional features I don't use, but may sometime in the future:<br /><br />* Accessing \\"cloud\\" services like DropBox, Google Drive, Skydrive, Amazon S3 and others.<br />* Dynamic library views of your content (think Windows 7): Pictures, Music, Movies and Books.<br /><br />This absolutely one of the best Android apps I've used and I don't see myself stopping any time soon. Kudos to the developers for such an awesome product!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun, great puzzles. Can't wait for more levels...more updates please. Only has ten levels right now. I like that the clues are in different rooms.
0985557834|5.0|There are many books on para-cord. None are done as well or have as much original content as the paracord fusion ties books. I'm really enjoying volume 2. I'm anxious for the kindle book to come out because between my wife and my 4 daughters I'm having trouble getting time with my copy of the book. I really want to make the sandals.
159463176X|5.0|I just love the book and I am getting ready to order another one for my nephew. I will be placing that order soon.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  I could watch it over and over.  The scenery is beautiful as are the sets.  Wonderful, wonderful.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This was a great movie. I am not sure how it came out at the Oscars but being a Leonardo and Jamie fan I was in 7th heaven and then all of the other actors made it something special.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|At first I thought this book was a joke. I'm not kidding. It was as cliche as cliche can be. But I kept reading it...and I was hooked! Don't pass up this book from the first few chapters. I promise that it gets better and the story actually gets better as the series continues.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver is amazing at creating characters. That's what interested me so much about this book. Her characters were so real that I felt like I knew them in real life. No joke! I haven't read a book with such great characterization since Harry Potter. [[ASIN:0061726834 Delirium]] is set in a society that fears the deliria, otherwise known as love. It preaches that love destroys and can cause rational humans to do irrational things and follows the main character through her journey of figuring out if love can really push someone beyond the limits of rational thought. Great read!
0425266060|3.0|Sylvia Day - author<br />It was as well written as could be for the subject that was covered. The fact that we knew what was going to happen, when, the results of such actions, future actions - all so mundane and not so interesting. Some &#34;hot&#34; spots but I could read &#34;Can this marriage be saved&#34; and get as much arousal. Sorry Sylvia - good try.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|[[ASIN:1442419814 Uglies (The Uglies)]], written by Scott Westerfield, is an action-packed futuristic dystopian novel about an Ugly named Tally Youngblood. In a society where everyone is Ugly until their operation at age sixteen and Pretty afterward, Tally longs to turn Pretty. As her birthday nears, she unearths disturbing facts about the operation and her society at large forcing her to decide who she truly wants to be while being manipulated by those who govern her.<br /><br />I love this novel. Westerfield writes about many issues that our society deals with, such as big government, environmental waste, appearance biases, and technology, all weaved into a storyline that made me flip the pages eagerly. Not only did I enjoy reading this novel, but it had such an impact on me that I contemplated how I could change my behavior so that I could better the world around me. In essence, I became a pseudo Tally, unearthing truths about my life that needed to be repaired. Great read.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|At first I was put off by seeing the embassy under siege and the visual of the people trying to break in so I stopped the movie. Then feeling possibly that I had not given it a fair chance, I resumed viewing it and was so very glad that I did. Wonderful.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Written by the romance novel guru, Nicholas Sparks, [[ASIN:1455523550 Safe Haven]] is a novel about a love between two people complicated by their past. Running from an abusive marriage, Katie lives in Safe Haven trying to keep her identity secret. Alex, a widowed husband with two wonderful kids, owns a local store that Katie shops at. As they get to know one another, they find that their attraction for each other grows--but they must learn to cope with their pasts and overcome the challenges placed before them.<br /><br />This novel was both familiar and fresh compared to Sparks' other novels. While the setting remains in North Carolina, the good ol' South, his topic is dramatically different. He tackles the feat of writing about an abusive relationship clouded by an image of perfection and a life where a husband deals with his wife's death and his responsibilities as a father, while at the same time keeping love at the forefront. The entire story is above love--love of your enemies, love of your situation, love of your loved ones. It begs the question, can love overcome all? A very well-written, enticing story.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|very good movie highly recommended.......if you love a movie with romance and suspense this is it .....would watch it again
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Started out great. Messed up. Horrible now. Why I have to spend peanuts? No choice no game. Have to touch where you point. That's a bunch of shit. I used to love this game. Uninstalled it to fix it; installed it again and got this steaming hot shit. What happened?!?! So disappointed! I really bate this crock.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|I thought this movie was entertaining. I like all the actors and I thought it was great visually. I bought just the movie, no extras. Will watch again happily. I feel it was money well spent. I love Sam Raimi as well.
0345525558|5.0|What a wonderful, lovely book!  I read this over the course of a 2+ week vacation and loved every moment.  It is so easy to both hate and love the main character, Victoria.  It was her journey of self-discovery that really resonated with me though.  I hope Vanessa Diffenbaugh writes another one soon.  Highly recommend it!
B006IYG5HE|3.0|This is one of Jo Nesbo's earlier books so I guess that's not why I found it as good as his later books.  It took a while to get into the real story.  But I love all of the Harry Hole series and that's why I read it.  I've sort of started out at the most recent books and am going back to the beginning.
B000XJ5TOK|5.0|fully detailed, loved the sound effects of this movie, i would watch it again and again and would recommend buying movies from amazon.com
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is wonderful!<br />Moved me to tears and made me truly contemplate real / rare kindness in our every day lives.<br />Young and old would benefit from the lessons of this book.<br />Loved seeing Augie from all the different perspectives of those in his life.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely love this series. The CDs are very well done. I would recommend this set of CDs to anyone who likes to do marathon Downton watching.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a great app packed with useful info. I probably don't use it to its full potential but it does everything I want and more...high degree of accuracy regarding battery life for various activities
